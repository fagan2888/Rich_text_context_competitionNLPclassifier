Context: Indoor tanning is a risk factor for skin can-
cer, but the population-based prevalence of this behav-
ior among adolescents is not clearly known.
Objectives: To describe the prevalence of tanning booth
use among white US adolescents and to assess its asso-
ciation with sociodemographic factors, health behav-
iors, and appearance.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A nationally rep-
resentative sample of 6903 non-Hispanic white adoles-
cents, aged 13 to 19 years, who participated in Wave II
(between April 1, 1996, and August 31, 1996) of the Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.
Main Outcome Measure: Frequency of lifetime use
of indoor artificial tanning facilities.
Results: With the data weighted to national levels, 36.8%
ofthewhitefemaleadolescentsand11.2%ofthewhitemale
adolescents have used a tanning booth at least once in their
life, while 28.1% and 6.9% of the female and male adoles-
cents, respectively, reported tanning booth use 3 or more
times. The percentage of female adolescents using tan-
ningbooths3ormoretimesincreasedwithage,from11.2%
of the 13- to 14-year-olds to 47.0% of 18- to 19-year-olds
and also increased with greater tanning ability, from 12.6%
of the poor tanners to 38.1% of those with a strong tan re-
sponse. After multivariate adjustment, those residing in the
Midwest (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.38; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 1.53-3.68) or South (aOR, 2.91; 95%
CI, 1.89-4.53), attending a rural high school (aOR, 1.80;
95% CI, 1.09-2.98), and reporting the use of 2 or 3 sub-
stances (aOR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.44-3.82) were more likely
to use indoor tanning facilities, as were dieters (aOR, 1.26;
95%CI,1.01-1.57)regardlessoftheirbodymassindex.De-
creasedoddsofindoortanningwereobservedamongthose
with a college-educated mother (aOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-
0.90) and greater cognitive ability (per 10-point score in-
crease; aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96) while routine par-
ticipationinphysicalactivitysignificantlyloweredtheodds
of indoor tanning only among female adolescents.
Conclusions: Indoor tanning is prevalent, particularly
among female adolescents, and aligns with other risk be-
haviors, appearance-related factors, and intentional sun-
bathing. The risks of artificial tanning need increased em-
phasis among adolescents, especially in the Midwest and
South where extremes in the availability of natural light
appear to send intentional tanners indoors.

THE UV RADIATION compo-
nent of natural light is a risk
factor for skin cancer of all
types1 and artificial light
from sunbeds, sunlamps,
and commercial tanning facilities, referred
to here as "tanning booth use," also con-
tain UV radiation. Studies using detailed
exposure measurements have shown an as-
sociation between artificial tanning de-
vices and cutaneous malignant mela-
noma while other studies have reported
mixed results.2-4 Use of these devices by
adolescents, particularly older female teen-
agers, has been documented in US5-8 and
international studies9,10 and short-term ad-
verse health effects have been reported
by adults and adolescents.5,10,11 Despite
the potential for both short- and long-
term adverse effects, the continued use
of these devices demonstrates some ado-
lescents' strong motivation for a tanned
appearance.
Tanning booth use, as other behav-
iors, is likely to be influenced by cognitive,

METHODS
AHS DESIGN
The AHS was designed to collect longitudinal data on health-
related behaviors of adolescents in grades 7 through 12 and to
explore the effects of individual characteristics and social envi-
ronments on those behaviors.16 One hundred thirty-two schools
in 80 communities were enrolled based on a sampling design that
ensured representation of US schools for region of country, ur-
banicity, school type, ethnicity, and school size. The design and
administration of the study surveys have been described else-
where.16,17 The current analysis is based on Wave II data col-
lected between April 1, 1996, and August 31, 1996, with the ex-
ception of maternal education that was obtained previously from
the parent survey. The Wave II total response rate was 88.2%16
and the Wave II grand sample weights provided by the AHS si-
multaneously adjusted for nonresponse and the different selec-
tion probabilities of sample members.
The AHS data were collected with active parental consent
(Waves I and II) and under strict guidelines of confidentiality
to guard against deductive disclosure. Human subject protec-
tion during both the primary data collection (conducted by the
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) and the secondary
use of these data by us was reviewed and approved by our re-
spective institutional review boards.
PARTICIPANTS
Participants included in this analysis (1) had a Wave II grand
sample weight, (2) were between 13 and 19 years old, (3) self-
identified as non-Hispanic white, and (4) answered all sun-
related outcome questions. The final sample size for analysis
was 6903 of the 7573 white respondents in Wave II. The analy-
sis was restricted to white adolescents because they are the pri-
mary users of the artificial tanning facilities and are at signifi-
cantly greater risk for both short- and long-term adverse effects
from overexposure to UV radiation.

have you used a sunlamp or a tanning booth or a tanning parlor
orsalon?"The6responsecategories(Table1)weredichotomized
into nonusers (3 times, 82.4%) and users (3 times, 17.6%).
Sociodemographics, Skin Type, and Sunbathing
Age, sex, geographic region of residence, urban location of the
school, maternal educational level, and student income or al-
lowance were recorded for each respondent. The following 2
questions assessed skin solar response type: "After several
months of not being in the sun, when you go out in the sun
without sunscreen or protective clothing for the first time for
at least an hour, do you get . . . " a severe sunburn with blis-
ters; a bad sunburn that peels later (combined for burn type
1/2); a mild sunburn that becomes a tan (burn type 3); or a sun-
tan without burning (burn type 4). The tan response was mea-
sured by the question: "When you go out in the sun every day
for 2 weeks, do you get . . . " very dark and deeply tanned (tan
type 4); moderately tanned (tan type 3); mildly tanned (tan type
2); only freckled, no suntan at all or repeated sunburns (tan
type 1). Both questions included an "Other" category without
additional specification. Intentional sunbathing was mea-
sured by the question: "During the summer, how often do you
sunbathe, or lie in the sun, to get a tan?" with response cat-
egories of frequently, occasionally, rarely, or never (referent).
Health Behaviors
Any use of tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana since the Wave I in-
terview (mean [SD] time since Wave I was 10.9 [1.6] months)
was combined and categorized as no substance use (referent),
1 substance used, or 2 or 3 substances used. A nutrition be-
havior index was constructed from 3 questions regarding eat-
ing behaviors in the last 7 days: (1) eating breakfast on 5 or
more days (yes, 1; no, 0); (2) eating fast food on 2 or more days
(no, 1; yes, 0); and (3) taking vitamin supplements (yes, 1; no,
0). Responses were summed and categorized as 0, poor behav-
iors (referent); 1, moderate behaviors; 2 or 3, good behaviors.
Physical activity was included as a composite score from 3 ques-
tions regarding the frequency per week of participating in a va-
riety of active sports or exercises. Responses were summed over
the 3 questions with a range of 0 to 15 or more times per week
and analyzed as a continuous variable.
Appearance-Related Variables
Body mass index was calculated from physical measurements ob-
tained at the time of the Wave II interview (n=6774) or from self-
reported height and weight (n=98). Missing cases (n=31) were
imputed with the Stata18 imputation command using the sample
BMI, age, and sex. Respondents were then categorized accord-
ing to the gender-specific BMI-for-age Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention growth curves.19 Body image was measured
with "How do you think of yourself in terms of weight?" with 5
response categories ranging from very underweight to very over-
weight. Teenagers reported a self-assessment of physical matu-
rity with responses ranging from "younger than most my age"
through "older than most my age."

Dieting behavior was measured by self-report of trying to
lose weight, gain weight, or neither (referent). Responses from
2 questions about a permanent tattoo (yes, 1; no, 0) and body
piercing, other than ears (yes, 1; no, 0) were summed and di-
chotomized as neither (0, referent) and either or both (1).
Psychosocial Measures
The Add Health­Picture Vocabulary Test, used as a measure
of cognitive ability, is an abridged version of the Peabody Pic-
ture Vocabulary Test-Revised20 and its validation and use in the
AHS is reported elsewhere.21 Age-standardized scores for this
sample of teenagers ranged from 77 to 129 (weighted mean [SE],
104.7 [0.48]). One item assessed thoughtful decision making
on a 5-item Likert scale of strongly agree (5) to strongly dis-
agree (1) regarding "making decisions without thinking too
much about the consequences."
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were analyzed using the design-based survey commands
in Stata Statistical Software, Release 6.018 to adjust for the ef-
fects of the complex survey design used in the AHS and to pro-
duce unbiased estimates of the SEs. Crude associations be-
tween tanning booth use and categorical study variables were
examined by sex using 2 tests of independence implemented
with survey design-based corrections. Age, physical activity level,
thoughtful decision making, and Add Health­Picture Vocabu-
lary Test score were examined as continuous variables and com-
pared between tanning booth users and nonusers within gen-
der with weighted t tests.
Hypothesized risk factors for tanning booth use were or-
ganized within a multivariate framework that examined the re-
lationship between tanning booth use and (1) sociodemo-
graphic factors, (2) skin type and sunbathing practices, (3) health
behaviors, (4) appearance-related behaviors, and (5) psycho-
social factors. Study variables significant in the 2 analyses at
P.05 were included in preliminary logistic regression mod-
els to assess the independent contribution of candidate vari-
ables within these domains to tanning booth use. A final lo-
gistic model was determined by a stepwise backward elimination
approach using significant predictors from all 5 domains, in-
cluding 2-way interaction terms between BMI and dieting be-
havior, sex and nutritional behavior, sex and physical activity,
and sex and physical maturity. The contribution of each inde-
pendent variable to the model was examined using an ad-
justed Wald statistic. Nonsignificant variables remained in the
model if they proved to be confounders (ie, if their exclusion
altered other parameter coefficients by 10%) or improved the
fit of the model based on the Hosmer-Lemeshow 2 Goodness-
of-Fit statistic,22 resulting in the most parsimonious model in
terms of individual variables and overall model fit. Adjusted
odds ratios and 95% CIs were reported from the multivariate
analysis.
RESULTS
DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
The final sample of 6903 respondents represented a
weighted total of about 12.03 million non-Hispanic white
adolescents in the United States between the ages of 13 and
19 years. Male and female adolescents were equally repre-
sented with weighted mean age of 15.9 years (95%
CI, 15.6-16.1). Almost two thirds of the teenagers at-
tendedsuburbanschools,and22.0%hadacollege-degreed
mother. Most teenagers classified their unprotected skin
responseasburntype1/2orburntype3(19.4%and47.3%,
respectively). A larger majority of white teenagers re-
ported at least a mild tan or better after a 2-week exposure
(tan types 2-4, 87.6%), suggesting that most white adoles-
cents perceive themselves as capable of obtaining a tan.
Overall, 24.1% of the respondents used a tanning fa-
cility at least once in their life, representing 2.9 million ado-
lescents (Table 1). Six and a half percent of the teenagers
reported indoor tanning only once or twice, while 17.6%
used tanning booths 3 or more times. Among female ado-
lescents who have ever used a tanning booth, 76.2% did
so 3 or more times, while 50.8% used them 10 or more
times. Thus, multiple tanning sessions appear to be the
norm. For this analysis, tanning booth users were defined
as those who reported indoor tanning 3 or more times.
As given in Table 2, more female than male adoles-
cents have used tanning facilities (28.1% vs 6.9%) and the
frequencyoftanningboothuseincreasedwithage.Thepro-
portion of tanning booth users increased with the increas-
ing ability to tan and with a decreasing tendency to burn.
The proportion of indoor tanners was different by region,
urban locale, student income or allowance, and maternal
educational level but not by the month of the survey.
Weighted percentages were obtained for the distri-
bution of all other study variables between tanning booth
users and nonusers by sex (Table 3). Tanning booth us-
ers were more frequent sunbathers and substance users.
Female tanning booth users had a higher mean (SE) par-
ticipation in physical activities (5.1 [0.14] times per week)
and more indoor tanners reported 2 to 3 good nutritional
behaviors (40.7%), both compared with female nonusers.
Overall, nonusers had a higher average score on the Add
Health­Picture Vocabulary Test and more female nonus-
ers agreed with a thoughtful decision-making process com-
pared with indoor tanners. Because several variables dem-
onstrated associations with tanning booth use that differed
by sex, interaction terms with these variables and sex were
included in the logistic regression analyses.
MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC
REGRESSION MODELS
From the initial domain-specific models, burn type, month
of interview, and body image were not significantly as-
sociated with tanning booth use and were not confound-
ers. The interaction of BMI and dieting behavior was also
not significant. Frequent sunbathers were 8 times more
likely to use a tanning booth than those who never sun-
bathed (adjusted odds ratio, 8.29; 95% CI, 6.0-11.44).
However, the frequency of sunbathing also redundantly
controlled for other independent variables (for example
being female and skin type) and its presence signifi-
cantly reduced the fit of the model. Ultimately, sunbath-
ing, interview month, body image, and burn type were
not retained in the final model.
Allvariablesthatdemonstratedsignificanceinthepre-
liminary models were included in a final model (Table 4).

creased the likelihood of tanning booth use (adjusted odds
ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.91).
Those reporting the use of 2 or 3 substances were
more than 3 times as likely to be tanning booth users com-
pared with those who reported no substance use. Those
attempting weight loss and female adolescents who per-
ceived themselves as more physically mature than their
peers were also more likely to be indoor tanners. Poor
tanning ability, greater cognitive ability, and higher BMI
all remained protective factors. Increasing frequency of
physical activity also decreased the odds of indoor tan-
ning among female adolescents. In the final model, body
piercing/tattoos and thoughtful decision making, and the
modification of nutritional behaviors by sex were no
longer independent predictors of tanning booth use.
COMMENT
Thecurrentanalysispresentsnationalestimatesofthepreva-
lence of lifetime tanning booth use in the white adoles-
cent US population as well as the relationship of this ac-
tivity to other risk behaviors. Tanning booth use increased
with age among adolescents regardless of sex, but female
adolescentsconsistentlyreportedmorefrequentindoortan-
ning than male adolescents. In conjunction with 2 recent
national reports,7,8 these results consistently estimate that
indoor tanning among white teenagers is significant, with
30% to 40% of 16- through 18-year-old white female ado-
lescents using tanning booths, many of them repeatedly.

ten perceive themselves as less sun susceptible than would
be scored by skin reflectance measurements. This under-
estimation of sun sensitivity would result in sun-sensitive

Adolescents in the Midwest and South were 2 to 3
times more likely to use tanning booths compared with the
rest of the country. Increased use of indoor tanning beds
in areas of higher ambient UV radiation (South) might be
explainedbydiscomfortduringsunbathinginoutdoorheat
or the desire to "base tan" indoors prior to intense natural
light exposure. The significant association of outdoor sun-
bathing and indoor tanning is of concern because of in-
tenseexposuretoUV-AraysfromindoortanningandUV-B

To our knowledge, this analysis reveals for the first
time the strong positive association of other health-risk
behaviors with tanning booth use among US adoles-
cents and is congruent with the reported negative asso-
ciations of smoking, alcohol, and marijuana use with sun-
screen use.26-28 If intentional tanning aligns with other
health-risk behaviors, incorporating antitanning mes-
sages into comprehensive prevention messages could

supplement topic-specific curricula on sun-related be-
haviors. In addition, physician health behavior counsel-
ing to adolescents should include the potential risk of
tanning booth use.29
Appearance-related motives (eg, looking attrac-
tive, perceived attractiveness, and self-presentation mo-
tives) have been identified as strong psychosocial indi-
cators of intentional sun exposure among adolescents.30,31
Dieting activity and body piercing/tattoos are behaviors
generally intended to enhance attractiveness and were hy-
pothesized to be positively associated with tanning bed
use to improve appearance. Trying to lose weight mod-
erately increased the odds of tanning booth use while an
actual greater BMI was associated with decreased in-
door tanning. Thus, these dieters include many average-
weight individuals (generally female adolescents) who
may also be tanning to increase attractiveness. Truly over-
weight adolescents seem less likely to engage in this be-
havior, possibly because they may not be comfortable en-
tering a tanning facility.
Usingadifferentparadigm,othershavesuggestedthat
appearance-enhancing behaviors present alternatives from
which persons will choose. Hillhouse et al14 determined
that college students with strong positive attitudes to-
ward artificial tanning held strong negative attitudes to-
ward clothing as an alternate behavior to improve attrac-
tiveness, but found no relationship with exercise, weight
control, financial status, or intelligence. Our framework
included these (except clothing) and other variables in a
sample of younger adolescents and found several associa-
tionswithtanningbeduse,suggestingthatmultiplechoices
for appearance enhancement are possible especially at
younger ages when adolescents are experimenting with
ways to increase peer acceptance. Appearance-related be-
haviorsmayincludebothpositiveandnegativeaspectsand,
thus, can be associated with both positive and negative be-
haviors. Physical activity and good nutrition may en-
hance appearance as well as overall good health, while
weight control via smoking may improve appearance with
poor health consequences. Thus, models of tanning be-
haviors should include diverse behaviors as well as psy-
chosocial and cognitive variables to further elucidate
the influential relationships and care must be taken when
designing interventions surrounding appearance motiva-
tion not to present alternatives that may inadvertently en-
courage other risk behaviors.
We interpret using an artificial tanning facility once
or twice to be experimental and not representative of the
behavior. Among the youngest teenagers, this may be too
conservative of an approach, that is, even 1 or 2 visits at
this age may identify a highly motivated tanner who will
eventually engage in additional tanning sessions given
time. Thus, our observed associations may actually be bi-
What This Study Adds
A tanned appearance continues to be considered healthy
and attractive and a measurable segment of the US ado-
lescent population engages in the use of artificial light
sources (eg, tanning beds or sunlamps) to achieve a tan.
Even as commercial facilities promote indoor tanning as
a safe tan, both short- and long-term adverse effects have
been associated with tanning bed use. Development of
interventions targeting the use of indoor tanning facili-
ties would benefit from a better understanding of the cor-
relates of tanning booth use in a large representative sur-
vey of adolescents.
Prior surveys on artificial tanning in the United States
focused on areas of lower ambient sunlight, but this analy-
sis demonstrates that indoor tanning is practiced in areas
of high sunlight as well, suggesting that advice to avoid
indoor tanning should not be overlooked in sunnier re-
gions. Indoor tanning generally involves multiple ses-
sionsandisstronglyassociatedwithsunbathing;thus,teen-
agers who maintain year-round tans or repeatedly base tan
indoors prior to outdoor sunbathing risk exposure to mul-
tiple sources of UV radiation and the unknown conse-
quences of that combination. Finally, tanning booth use
among high school adolescents seems to align with ap-
pearance-related factors and other health-risk behaviors,
providing potential intervention pathways and linkages to
both novel and tested prevention strategies.

ased toward the null since some tanning booth users may
have been misclassified as nonusers. The period of tan-
ning booth use was specified as "in your life." Thus, we
do not know, for example, if the 10 to 20 sessions were
over a 2-week period or spread out over the previous 2
years. While this represents a limitation in defining the
behavior pattern more precisely, dichotomizing the fre-
quencies as a response variable still permits cautious in-
terpretation that certain independent variables associ-
ate with repeated indoor tanning.
Several limitations to our study are similar to previ-
ous reports. We relied on self-reported data without ad-
ditionalobjectivecorroboration.However,atleastonestudy
has provided evidence that adolescents' self-report of sun
protective practices was valid.32 The cross-sectional na-
ture of the data does not permit causal inferences to be
drawn nor does it allow examining an individual's behav-
ior throughout adolescence. Future study design would
benefit from a longitudinal component.
The present findings extend previous work that a
substantial minority of adolescents engage in indoor tan-
ning practices and further suggest that this behavior may
align with other health-risk and health-promoting behav-
iors practiced by adolescents. Availability of tanning sa-
lons33 and economic marketing tactics2,34 give teenagers
with strong intentions to tan another method to do so. In-
creased emphasis on interventions and strategies to pre-
vent both short- and long-term adverse effects of unpro-
tected UV exposure from artificial light among adolescents
is warranted.
