Introduction
Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are
the third most frequent cause of healthcare-associated infec-
tion (HAI; The Joint Commission, 2012). Mortality rates
from CLABSI are 12% to 25% and significantly increase cost
and hospital length of stay (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC], 2011). Nurses are on the frontline of
CLABSI prevention, contributing to the 58% decrease in
CLABSI rates that has occurred between 2001 and 2009
(CDC, 2016). Despite their involvement in the process, they
may not understand the implications that mandatory public
reporting or current pay-for-performance programs may have
on their hospital system. Statistics are readily available online
for consumers to review how local hospitals compare with
one another in terms of HAI rates and other critical factors
that determine hospital quality. Favorable performance in
these metrics attracts patients, influences accreditation
boards, and may lead to salary bonuses. Mandatory public
reporting of CLABSI and other HAI began in 2003 and has
increased incrementally over time in terms of participation
and what is required to be reported--37 states currently
require reporting, while the rest are incentivized to do so
(Herzig, Reagan, Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Srinath, & Stone,
2015; Stone et al., 2015). Hospitals are now facing extrinsic
pressures to keep their CLABSI rates low; otherwise, they
may experience a 1% reduction in Medicare reimbursement.
Pressure on hospital systems may enhance CLABSI safety
and prevention efforts. Attempts at improving healthcare out-
comes and cost are deeply interrelated, and this review of lit-
erature aims to summarize current knowledge regarding how
extrinsic factors have affected rates of CLABSI.
Current State of CLABSI Prevention
Best evidence-based practice is a driver to intrinsically
changing individual nurse behavior and individual hospital
standards extrinsically influence nursing practice to achieve
lower CLABSI rates. One of the most researched aspects of
CLABSIs is testing various prevention methods. Study of
best practices is important to review because the purpose
of mandatory reporting, pay-for-performance, and the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) are all designed at incentivizing
hospitals toward implementing best practices and punishing
those who fail to do so. CLABSI-prevention research has
been pivotal in the gradual decline of CLABSIs and develop-
ment of best practices implemented over the past decade,

Review of Best Practices for CLABSI
Prevention and the Impact of Recent
Legislation on CLABSI Reporting
Benjamin Woodward1 and Reba Umberger1
Abstract
Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are a very common source of healthcare-associated infection
(HAI). Incidence of CLABSI has been significantly reduced through the efforts of nurses, healthcare providers, and infection
preventionists. Extrinsic factors such as recently enacted legislation and mandatory reporting have not been closely examined
in relation to changes in rates of HAI. The following review will examine evidence-based practices related to CLABSI and
how they are reported, as well as how the Affordable Care Act, mandatory reporting, and pay-for-performance programs
have affected these best practices related to CLABSI prevention. There is a disconnect in the methods and guidelines for
reporting CLABSI between these programs, specifically among local monitoring agencies and the various federal oversight
organizations. Future research will focus on addressing the gap in what defines a CLABSI and whether or not these programs
to incentivize hospital to reduce CLABSI rates are effective.

including studies focusing strictly on strict hand hygiene
(Johnson et al., 2014), CLABSI-prevention bundles includ-
ing interventions to increase hand hygiene compliance
(Berenholtz et al., 2014; Guerin, Wagner, Rains, & Bessesen,
2010; Theodoro et al., 2015), antimicrobial catheters
(Rutkoff, 2014), and chlorhexidine baths (Dixon & Carver,
2010; Scheithauer et al., 2014). Hospital culture is an extrin-
sic motivator that plays a large role in the effectiveness of
adopting these best practices (Fan et al., 2016). Intrinsic
motivation, the degree to which individual healthcare pro-
viders drive toward and implement best practices, is difficult
to cultivate but can be aided by champions of a particular
healthcare improvement process who have stronger profes-
sional relationships with bedside nurses and physicians
(Damschroder et al., 2009). If healthcare providers are
unwilling to alter their practice, little change is likely to
occur, and those attempting to improve hospital CLABSI
rates should consider these intrinsic and extrinsic factors as
equally important to establishing hospital protocols in line
with best practice guidelines.
Although the reduction in CLABSI rates is an excellent
trend, recent research indicates that rates can still be signifi-
cantly reduced across the United States by applying a simple
bundled approach. The bundle includes efforts to ensure best
practices are being implemented, to improve safety culture
and teamwork, and to provide feedback to leaders in quality
improvement (Berenholtz et al., 2014; Guerin et al., 2010).
There has been a vast amount of research devoted to discov-
ering best practices related to CLABSI prevention, but this
review will focus on the less-studied extrinsic factors related
to CLABSI prevention.
Regulatory Bodies and Their Roles in
Mandatory Reporting
The following three sections will cover the current process of
reporting CLABSIs. This information is important for nurses
to understand because it will help them to understand why
CLABSI has become such a large focus in hospitals. There
are several regulatory bodies that determine whether a
CLABSI is present, how they are coded for medical billing,
and methods of reporting CLABSI to state and federal data-
bases. The CDC and the National Healthcare Safety Network
(NHSN) have guidelines for laboratory-confirmed blood-
stream infection (LCBI), which determines whether or not a
bloodstream infection is the result of a central line. Once a
CLABSIhasbeenidentified,theCMSutilizetheInternational
Classification of Diseases (ICD) selected by providers to
code the CLABSI for billing. The majority of states also
require hospitals to report their CLABSIs to the NHSN
through providers coding with ICD and/or infection preven-
tionists following LCBI guidelines. In states where this is not
mandated, healthcare providers are incentivized to provide
their ICD codes to payers such as CMS and private insurance
companies. Each of these links in the chain of mandatory
reporting is vital to ensuring accurate CLABSI identification
at the levels of the patient, hospital, state, and nation.
Identifying Patients With CLABSI
According to further CDC guidelines, LCBIs are divided
into LCBI 1, LCBI 2, and LCBI 3 (LCBI 3 will not be defined
or used due to its sole use in patients < 1 year of age, which
is not the focus of this review). An LCBI 1 is defined as a
patient with a recognized pathogen cultured from one or
more blood cultures, and this cultured bacteria is not related
to an infection at any other site. This confirms that the blood-
stream infection is not related to another source of infection
and is therefore determined to be caused by the central line.
LCBI 2 requires that the patient have either fever (>38°C),
chills, or hypotension, alongside positive blood lab results
(cultures) that are not related to infection at another site.
Finally, bacteria must be cultured from two or more blood
tests drawn within a 24-hr period. LCBI 2 allows for diagno-
sis of a CLABSI when blood cultures reveal a microorgan-
ism that is not strictly pathogenic in nature (CDC, 2016).
Recent changes occurred in 2015, with the CDC and NHSN
(Patient Safety Manual, 2015) adding an extra table in their
guidelines, which was "added to highlight site specific crite-
ria that require blood cultures in order to meet a secondary
BSI" (p. 1).
Culturing bacteria from blood samples taken from patients
who are suspected to have a CLABSI is a pivotal piece in
diagnosing the infection, as outlined in LCBIs 1 and 2. If
there are multiple central lines in place, they should be cul-
tured at the same time, and oftentimes, the suspected catheter
is removed to do so. Evidence-based practice calls for all
short-term catheters such as peripherally inserted catheters
(not peripherally inserted central catheters [PICC]), midline
catheters, and non-tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs)
to be removed, while long-term catheters such as PICCs and
tunneled CVCs should be removed in the event of severe
sepsis, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, and instances
of bloodstream infection, which do not resolve within 72 hr
following appropriate antibiotic therapy (Han, Liang, &
Marschall, 2010). If removal of the line for culturing is not
recommended, then the possibility of infection from any
other sites must be ruled out (CDC, 2016). Culturing allows
providers to know exactly what type of microorganism that
they are trying to treat/eradicate, which allows for directed
antibiotic therapy. In practice, it is illogical and dangerous to
wait for culture results, and providers usually begin immedi-
ate treatment.
Catheter tips should not be routinely cultured unless there
is a clinical indication that a CLABSI may be present (CDC,
2015c). Complexity can make this extremely difficult
because patients may have several potential sources of infec-
tion. Current recommendations are to rely on clinical judg-
ment when determining whether to remove a line and culture
it; use of culturing methods that preserve the integrity of the
Woodward and Umberger 3
central line is recommended to prevent unnecessary expense
and time by providers and the laboratory personnel (CDC,
2015a; Raad, Hanna, & Maki, 2007).
Medical Billing for CLABSI
Currently, the ICD Version 10 coding is the most used system
of reporting medical diagnoses and procedures in the United
States (CMS, 2015b). This classification system replaced
ICD-9startingonOctober1,2015(WorldHealthOrganization,
2015). In this system, a specific numerical code is assigned to
an individual diagnosis or medical procedure to facilitate eas-
ier reporting to surveillance system and insurance agencies.
According to CMS (2015), hospitals are now required under
the ACA to report their ICD findings and actions (including
CLABSIs and HAIs) within this system to be eligible for full
reimbursement. In short, if these codes are not reported, then
Medicare or Medicaid will not pay for aspects of the bill.
Hospitals with higher rates of CLABSIs will have their federal
reimbursement rates cut, with the hope being that hospitals
will take more measures and precautions to receive more of
this money. Now that hospitals and healthcare providers are
beginning to adapt and accept these measures as the norm,
research is necessary to assess whether or not these goals have
been met. Nursing research is beginning to fill this gap, con-
cluding that increased communication between health depart-
ments and agencies such as CMS is occurring, but uniform
definition of HAIs is still lacking between them (Stone et al.,
2015). A great deal more study is needed to evaluate the suc-
cess of these incentivizing or penalizing measures including
perspectives on specific mandates.
Reporting CLABSI at the National and State
Levels
As dictated by The Joint Commission on Accredidation of
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), hereinafter referred to
as The Joint Commission, CLABSIs are to be reported to the
NHSN. Although not all states have legislated this mandate,
there are incentives to report CLABSI in all states (The Joint
Commission, 2012). For states that do not mandate report-
ing, there are still systems in place to transfer ICD codes to
the CMS or private insurer to receive reimbursement. These
systems are specific to each state that does not have manda-
tory reporting guidelines (Beck & Margolin, 2007). CLABSIs
that are present on admission (POA), such as from contami-
nation from a long-term central line, do not need to be
reported to the NHSN. A CLABSI is considered POA if it
occurs within two calendar days of admission (CDC, 2016).
The hospital's infection prevention (IP) team is the primary
avenue of reporting as it collects data on infection rates
throughout its healthcare facility. In general, if a CLABSI is
suspected, an IP expert first examines the Electronic Medical
Record (EMR) for cultures and evidence to determine
whether the infection originated in a site other than a central
line. IPs consult with the nurse managers, team leaders, bed-
side nurses, and providers to glean pertinent information
related to the patient's condition. For example, in patients
who have a history of known intravenous (IV) drug use,
some CLABSI cases have been linked to IV drug abuse in
the hospital (Sammons, 2015). Ultimately, IP must prove that
another site is responsible for the infection, or it must be con-
sidered a CLABSI and reported (CDC, 2016). The NHSN
tracks HAIs in the United States.
Problems With Current Reporting
Guidelines
The process of identifying and reporting CLABSI has been
described as complicated and complex due to the ever-
changing definition of what constitutes a CLABSI and ambi-
guity about where infections come from, and complex
medical patients are at higher risk of contracting a CLABSI
(Backman, Melchreit, & Rodriguez, 2010; Hazamy et al.,
2013). Hospitals and infection preventionists use the LCBI
system to report to the NHSN, while healthcare providers
treat patients with CLABSI, who are assigned codes based
on the World Health Organization's ICD and used by the
CMS and the NHSN. The NHSN is primarily responsible for
surveillance of HAIs, whereas the CMS controls hospital
reimbursement. These two systems should ideally reach the
same findings regarding identification of CLABSI, but stud-
ies have shown that this is not always the case (Backman
et al., 2010; Hazamy et al., 2013; Moehring et al., 2013).
Incongruent interpretation between IP and healthcare provid-
ers can distort reported CLABSI rates and hospital reim-
bursement. With the advent of ICD-10 coding in October of
2015, adequacy in training of healthcare providers in a com-
pletely revamped system is currently unclear (World Health
Organization, 2015). Also a problem is the fact that only two
methods of CLABSI exist (LCBI and ICD). There is move-
ment to combine these two systems (Stone et al., 2015), but
healthcare providers may not have time to constantly update
their understanding of what currently constitutes a CLABSI.
Although healthcare providers are not directly responsible
for coding each diagnosis (this is the responsibility of trained
coders), they must have adequate support through labs,
assessments, and cultures to justify their medical interven-
tions. New definitions of requirements for confirming diag-
noses are constantly changing, and healthcare providers must
keep up with these changes to ensure accurate documenta-
tion and application of best practices.
Real-World Examples of Problems in
CLABSI Reporting
In a retrospective chart review study performed in Connecticut
from January 2009 throughApril 2009 in 30 adult intensive care
units (ICUs) and 3 pediatric ICUs (30 acute care hospitals), 476
septic events were identified (Backman et al., 2010). Forty-eight
4 SAGE Open
of these events were diagnosed as CLABSIs according to guide-
lines outlined by the NHSN and previously in this article.
Twenty-three (48%) of these CLABSIs had been reported to the
NHSN, leaving 25 (52%) CLABSIs, as defined by the reviewer
who utilized LCBIs 1 and 2 criteria, unreported. "Thirteen (43%)
hospitals were responsible for the 25 infections not reported"
(Backman et al., 2010, p. 384). This led to a deficit between the
hospital's reported rate of 1.97 infections per 1,000 central line
days and the actual rate of 3.51 per 1,000 central line days for this
period as determined by the researchers.
Going deeper into the data, 76% of the unreported
CLABSIs were diagnosed using LCBI 1 (as outlined in the
"Introduction" section of this article), leaving 24% of the
unreported CLABSIs being diagnosed with LCBI 2. In gen-
eral, underreporting appeared to be the trend, but certain hos-
pitals also fell victim to over-reporting bloodstream infections
that could be traced to sources other than a central line. In
discussion, the primary cause of this under- and over-
reporting was believed to be confusion by providers and IP
staff about surveillance definitions of CLABSIs and could
also be related to complex cases where sources of infection
are unclear. This confusion is compounded if central venous
catheters are simply removed without culturing once other
sources of infection are ruled out. Physicians are rightfully
more concerned with treating what they see as a bloodstream
infection rather than spending valuable time determining
whether this infection fits the specific requirements for a
CLABSI. It is IP's job to investigate and determine the
source of infection, but retrospective communication is
likely inadequate for analysis of all the factors in play at the
time of infection. Attributing positive blood cultures to
CLABSI can be challenging. The researchers concluded that
further education and training would be necessary to ensure
that all healthcare providers achieve a uniform definition of
what requirements the NHSN has for reporting of CLABSIs
(Backman et al., 2010).
In the state of New York, as of 2007, hospitals are required
to publically report instances of CLABSIs. To ensure that
protocols were followed, a large portion of the hospitals were
audited by a group of researchers to examine their medical
records of positive blood cultures obtained between 2007
and 2010 (Hazamy et al., 2013). Included in this study were
306 adult ICUs and 30 pediatric ICUs. In total, 5,697 patient
records were audited; 3,104 (54%) had a central line in place;
and 650 (21%) of these patients with a central line were
determined to have a CLABSI based on the reviewer's inter-
pretation. The amount of disparity between the reviewer's
findings and reports to the NHSN steadily decreased from
14% to 6% during the period of the study, which was likely
attributed to feedback from the reviewers. In the final year
(2010), the reviewers found 57 missed CLABSIs, with mis-
interpretation of what defines a CLABSI being the most
likely cause of this error (57%), and missed by surveillance
(provider did not include CLABSI in the differential) being
the second most likely (35%). In conclusion, this study found
that audits of hospitals and their patients was an effective
method for reducing confusion of CLABSI definition
between IP staff and the NHSN (Hazamy et al., 2013).
Researchers looking at 44 hospitals in Oregon also found a
disparity between the CLABSIs found by hospitals when
compared with the researchers applying strict definitions, but
they were able to improve accuracy through feedback given
to the hospitals (Oh et al., 2012). Feedback appears to be a
simple and effective way to help hospitals ensure they are
properly identifying infections.
These studies showed how the definition of a CLABSI is
oftentimes misinterpreted and misreported as a result. The
CDC is aware of problems in surveillance, noting that deci-
sions from IP to report to the NHSN can be overruled, and
clinicians may alter their diagnostic process to avoid classi-
fying an infection as hospital-acquired. They affirm that this
is an uncommon practice, but the fact that it exists is worri-
some and puts patients in danger of overuse and underuse of
diagnostic tests (CDC, 2015b). Despite this, with proper sur-
veillance and education, hospitals and the NHSN can reach a
uniform approach of identifying CLABSIs, which would
promote accurate reporting and knowledge of where we are
in preventing these infections. Without uniform and accurate
reporting guidelines, which are understood by all healthcare
providers, further study of prevention methods could be
inaccurate as a result of faulty reporting. This is a pivotal
area, which must be closely studied to fill in any gaps that
could impede the progress of current and future studies.
Differences of Reporting: ICD-9/10
CDC/CMS Versus NHSN
The CDC (2015a) determines criteria for defining CLABSI.
The ICD captures CLABSI based on provider diagnoses and
treatment. The top 10 leading ICD discharge diagnoses are
often used by health services researchers and other research-
ers; yet, there is some evidence that discrepancies exist
between classification of CLABSI by clinicians coding using
ICD and by infection preventionists applying CDC guide-
lines. These discrepancies indicate a need for standard defi-
nitions to be applied (Backman et al., 2010; Hazamy et al.,
2013; Moehring et al., 2013). IPs use strict definitions pro-
vided by the CDC. The CDC requires that each case be
reviewed and categorized as a LCBI-1 or LCBI-2. Providers
code their diagnoses through ICD.
This review will now shift focus toward pay-for-perfor-
mance programs, which are powerful mandates allowing
Medicare to adjust reimbursement based on certain criteria
(CMS, 2013).
Pay-for-Performance
The "Hospital Value-Based Purchasing" program as out-
lined by Medicare adjusts the amount that the government
agency pays out to hospitals based on a total performance
Woodward and Umberger 5
score (CMS, 2013). The total performance score is calcu-
lated using clinical process of care (20%), patient experi-
ence of care (30%), efficiency (20%), and the outcome
(30%). The clinical process of care focuses on five critical
areas of care including acute myocardial infarctions, heart
failure, pneumonia, surgical care, and HAIs. Value-based
purchasing for CLABSI was not implemented until 2015
(CMS, 2013). Medicare wants improvement in these areas
and has established a plan to reward good care and punish
unsatisfactory care. The HAI section is particularly inter-
esting, outlining the specific performance measures of giv-
ing patients an antibiotic within 1 hr of surgery, surgical
patients being given the right kind of antibiotic to help pre-
vent infection, and subsequently stopping unnecessary anti-
biotics within 24 hr after surgery. The patient experience of
care encompasses a wide variety of care domains, including
communication with healthcare providers, pain manage-
ment, and overall rating of the hospital. Medicare reim-
bursements are designed to efficiently incentivize hospitals
to provide services at a reasonable cost. The spending is
standardized for geographic location and overall patient
health status. The final piece in the total performance score
is the outcome, assessed by 30-day mortality rates, which
can be linked to the overall quality of care that a patient
receives (CMS, 2013).
Treatment for CLABSI can last anywhere from 7 days to 6
weeks depending on the cultured organism and the patient's
response to therapy (Han et al., 2010). The average cost per
inpatient day in the United States is US$2,212, although this
figure likely underestimates daily cost due to most patients
with CLABSI being treated in a more expensive ICU setting
(Kaiser Family Foundation, 2014). On average, CLABSI
diagnosis increases the cost of a hospital stay by US$30,919
to US$65,245 with an average of US$45,814. In the majority
of cases, the hospital is responsible for covering these addi-
tional costs (Zimlichman et al., 2013). Vancomycin is the
treatment of choice when treating CLABSI, and in instances
of severe sepsis, severe illness, or an immunocompromised
patient, coverage for gram-negative bacterial infection should
be included. These agents may include a "fourth generation
cephalosporin, a carbapenem, or a -lactam/-lactamase
inhibitor combination, with or without an aminoglycoside"
(Han et al., 2010, p. 153).
Due to the novelty of these pay-for-performance pro-
grams, there is only a small pool of empirical studies
using both an experimental and control group for direct
comparison. It is likely that studies are currently being
performed as hospitals adapt to these new policies under
the ACA, but it is important to know whether or not these
programs are effective at improving long-term patient
outcomes. Early research has found moderately positive
results from pay-for-performance, but it is the job of the
researchers to continue working to close the new gap,
which has opened up with the advent of these pay-for-
performance programs.
Pay-for-Performance Influence on HAI
A study was conducted to evaluate the pay-for-performance
program on improving quality of care (Werner, Kolstad,
Stuart, & Polsky, 2011). Two hundred sixty hospitals were
included in this program, with 780 hospitals used as the con-
trol group. The researchers used several methods to try to
create congruency between the experimental and control
groups, including current hospital costs and risk-standard-
ized mortality rates. The top 20% of hospitals eligible for
incentives received bonus funding from Medicare and
Medicaid proportional to their current level of compensation.
Hospitals with poor trends or consistently high rates of hos-
pital-associated infection were forced to pay penalties as a
result of unsatisfactory performance. During the first 3 years,
more than half of the pay-for-performance hospitals achieved
high performance scores, whereas less than a third of the
control group did. After 5 years, though, both groups became
nearly identical in their performance scores. The hospitals
that saw the greatest improvement were those with low com-
petition and a chance for large monetary reimbursement.
From this study, it is obvious that more research needs to
done to assess the effectiveness of pay-for-performance pro-
grams, and also that these programs will need to be tailored
specifically to hospitals depending on a wide variety of fac-
tors (Werner et al., 2011). Another study on pay-for-perfor-
mance programs noted general improvement in hospitals as a
result of their implementation, but they also called for stud-
ies evaluating pay-for-performance programs in conjunction
with mandatory reporting laws (Kahn Iii et al., 2015).
Another study measuring similar variables also found that
hospital costs decreased and patient satisfaction increased
where these programs were in place (Stanowski, Simpson, &
White, 2015). In general, it appears that initial studies on
pay-for-performance programs are finding positive out-
comes, but aspects of mandatory reporting are widely left out
of their research.
In a study focused on the impact of pay-for-performance
programs in relation to hospital-operating margins, research-
ers found that hospitals already experiencing financial pres-
sure (lowest quartile of operating margins) saw decreased
CLABSI rates after the CMS halted reimbursement for hos-
pital-acquired conditions (Lee, Calderwood, Vaz, Jin, &
Grant, 2015). Hospitals in the highest quartile of operating
margins did not see this decrease (Lee et al., 2015). This
seems to indicate that the effectiveness of pay-for-perfor-
mance programs is specific to each hospital's financial
situation.
Limitations
This review was limited in scope and did not review studies
focused on patient-specific risk factors such as increased sus-
ceptibility to infections due to immunosuppression. The
studies examined were generally longitudinal in nature, and
6 SAGE Open
the effectiveness of interventions was compared with obser-
vations from before their implementation.
Conclusion
Although research on CLABSIs has been widespread and
fairly comprehensive, new federal legislation such as the
ACAhas created gaps in our knowledge about how the use of
incentives and penalties affects reporting and incidence of
HAIs such as CLABSIs. Studies have been conducted in
various states on how effective these measures are at achiev-
ing their goals, but to truly capture its ramifications on a
widespread scale, each hospital needs individual analysis.
States and specific hospitals include a unique environment
that may respond well or poorly to generalized legislative
measures and should be individually analyzed. Laws and
legal guidelines are perhaps one of the most drastic instances
of inciting this change to happen. Obviously, some regula-
tions may be unhelpful or even harmful in furthering health-
care's progress, but it is impossible to know for sure what the
ramifications are without focused study and analysis.
Although it seems unlikely that we will ever live in a
world without these deadly infections, there is still obvious
room for improvement, which can reasonably and economi-
cally be attained. New programs such as pay-for-perfor-
mance have recently been established, which focus
particularly on rewarding hospitals who are successful at
reducing their rates of HAIs and withholding funds from
those that are unsuccessful at doing so. Research of CLABSIs
includes prevention, development, detection, and reporting
of CLABSIs. All of these are interrelated and necessitate fur-
ther research, especially by nurses. Nurses are in key roles to
save lives and reduce hospital costs by implementing best
practices to decrease the incidence of CLABSI.
