Although depression symptoms have been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among adults, little is
known about the association of adolescent-onset depression and development of T2DM in young adulthood and
whether the association differs by sex. We examined the association between high levels of depressive symptoms
in adolescence and T2DM in adulthood in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n =
12,657). Adolescents completed the 20-item version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale during
wave 1 (mean age, 16 years) and the 10-item version during follow-up (mean age, 29 years). A high level of depres-
sive symptoms was defined as a score of 16 or higher on the 20-item version or 11 or higher on the 10-item version.
T2DM was identified 13 years after baseline on the basis of either a glycated hemoglobin concentration of at least
6.5% or use of hypoglycemic medication (with or without insulin). Participants who reported taking insulin alone
were classified as having type 1 diabetes mellitus and excluded. In models adjusted for demographic characteris-
tics, women were at a higher risk of developing T2DM if they experienced high levels of depressive symptoms dur-
ing both adolescence and adulthood (odds ratio = 1.96, 95% confidence interval: 1.23, 3.11) than were those who
did not experience a high level of symptoms at either time point. No statistically significant associations were noted
among men (odds ratio = 0.46, 95% confidence interval: 0.20, 1.05).

Adults with depression are more likely to develop type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as well as insulin resistance (1,
2). Existing studies have mainly considered the association
between adult mental health and adult diabetes (2, 3), not
taking into account the increasing evidence that mental (4),
cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders (5) begin early in
childhood and adolescence. Reliance on assessments in adult-
hood of both depression and T2DM has limited the ability of
investigators in most studies to address temporality, which
raises the possibility of reverse causation, in which subclini-
cal T2DM risk factors contribute to both depression and clin-
ical T2DM development later in life. Because risk factors and
health behaviors known to affect obesity and diabetes can
persist from childhood to adolescence and into adulthood
(6, 7), a life-course framework for studying the etiology of
T2DM is crucial.
Adolescence is an important period of development be-
cause many health behaviors are established during these for-
mative years (8). Adolescent depression has been associated
with overweight and obesity in adulthood (9, 10), and adoles-
cent onset of depression is associated with both persistence of
depression into adulthood and the development of other co-
morbid psychiatric disorders throughout the life course (11).
To our knowledge, there have been only 2 studies in which
the longitudinal relationship between adolescent mental
health and the development of diabetes has been examined.
In a small study of primarily overweight or obese children,
Shomaker et al. (12) noted a significant association between
depression symptoms in childhood and insulin resistance
in adolescence. In a larger study based on the 1946 British
Cohort Study, adolescent affective disorder was associated
with diabetes mellitus at age 53 years (13). These results suggest

that factors during childhood and adolescence influence the tra-
jectory of T2DM development. However, it is not known
whether depression symptoms in adolescence influence T2DM
risk in the absence of adult depression symptoms or whether
it is the continuity of depression symptoms from adolescence
to adulthood that most strongly influences risk.
Sex differences in the relationship between obesity and de-
pression have been documented, with associations noted among
women but not men (14). Recently, using data from the First
National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, Demmer
et al. (15) reported an association between depressive symp-
tomatology and incident diabetes among women but not men.
Differential behavioral responses or physiological mechanisms
might contribute to potential sex differences. Women might be
more likely to cope with stress and mental health symptoms by
engaging in obesogenic behaviors, and men might be more
likely to cope by engaging in behaviors that do not promote
obesity (16). Physiological responses to depression, such as
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and inflam-
mation, are also implicated in both depression and diabetes and
have been noted to differ between sexes (17). Although the
mechanisms for this relationship are not fully known, it is plau-
sible that behavioral changes that accompany depression, such
as changes in dietary choices, sleep patterns, and physical activ-
ity level, might play a role. In addition, inflammatory processes
and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation might be
activated as a direct result of depression symptoms and in turn
might affect diabetes risk (18­20).
In the present study, we examined the relationship of de-
pression symptoms during adolescence and young adulthood
with the development of T2DM in adulthood in data from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health
(Add Health). We tested whether high levels of depressive
symptoms experienced in adolescence only, adulthood only,
or both developmental periods increased the odds of develop-
ing T2DM in adulthood. We also examined whether sex dif-
ferences appeared in this association.
METHODS
Study population
Add Health is a nationally representative, school-based,
longitudinal study of the health-related behaviors of adoles-
cents and their outcomes in adulthood. A questionnaire was
administered in 132 schools in the United States to a nation-
ally representative sample of students in grades 7 through 12,
plus selected oversampled minority groups, stratified by age
and sex, during the 1994­1995 school year. Four waves of in-
home interviews (wave 1, 1994­1995; wave 2, 1996; wave 3,
2001­2002; and wave 4, 2007­2008) were conducted. The
study design has been described in detail previously (21).
Briefly, a stratified random sample of public and private
high schools that was representative of US schools was se-
lected with respect to region of country, urbanicity, size, type,
and ethnic makeup of the student body.
Eligible schools included an 11th grade and enrolled more
than 30 students. The first wave of in-home interviews was con-
ducted between 1994 and 1995, and approximately 20,745 ad-
olescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years completed the
in-home questionnaire. During wave 4 of follow-up, 15,701 par-
ticipants were interviewed. In the present analyses, participants
were excluded if data were missing for sampling weights (n =
901), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c
) concentration (n = 1,290),
high levels of depressive symptoms at either time point (n =
101), orcovariates of interest (n = 237) or if they reported a preg-
nancy during wave 4 (n = 444) or a diabetes diagnosis before
age 16 years (n = 34). Participants whowere taking insulin alone
in adulthood (n = 37) were also excluded from the analyses be-
cause they were more likely to have type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Our study sample included 12,657 participants who com-
pleted waves 1 and 4 and met inclusion criteria. Sampleweights
designed for analyzing Add Health data include baseline
selection probabilities and school-level clustering, as well
as inverse probability weights to account for longitudinal at-
trition (22). Add Health was approved by the Institutional Re-
view Board of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
The Institutional Review Board of Columbia University,
New York, approved these analyses.
Diabetes
During wave 4 (mean age of participants, 29 years), an in-
home assessment was conducted. HbA1c
was assayed from
spots of dried capillary whole blood collected from finger
pricks during the home visit. HbA1c
concentration measured
from dried blood samples has been shown to have good
agreement with fresh whole blood samples (23). Participants
reported use of medications for diabetes (categories included
sulfonylureas, nonsulfonylureas, insulin, -glucosidase in-
hibitors, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, antidiabetic com-
binations, and miscellaneous antidiabetic agents) anytime
during the previous 4 weeks. T2DM was defined as an HbA1c
concentration of at least 6.5% (n = 429) or use of diabetes med-
ication with or without insulin (n = 123). Participants who re-
ported a diabetes diagnosis before the age of 16 years were
excluded from the analyses. Self-report of a diabetes diagnosis
is considered a valid method for identifying diabetes (24­26).
As in previous studies (27), we classified participants who re-
ported taking insulin alone as having type 1 diabetes mellitus
and excluded them from the analyses.
Depression symptoms
Participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale (CES-D) at 2 time points. The 20-item ver-
sion (CESD-20) was administered in wave 1 (mean age, 16
years), and the 10-item version (CES-D-10) was administered
in wave 4 (mean age, 29 years) (28). The CES-D is a widely
used measure with well-documented reliability and validity
(29­32). Depression was defined as a score of 16 or higher
on the CES-D-20 or 11 or higher on the CES-D-10 as per es-
tablished guidelines (33). Symptoms of depression during the
13-year study period were characterized as occurring in adoles-
cence only, in both adolescence and adulthood, or in adulthood
only or as not occurring in either time period.
Covariates
Wave 4 questionnaires contained questions about socio-
demographic factors, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
270 Suglia et al.

highest level of education achieved. In adulthood, the catego-
ries for highest level of education were less than high school,
high school graduate, some college, and college graduate or
higher. Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, sleep duration,
and physical activity were assessed at both wave 1 (adoles-
cence) and wave 4 (adulthood). In both adolescence and
adulthood, current daily smoking was defined as smoking
at least 1 cigarette per day in the previous 30 days. Physical
activity was defined by the number of bouts of moderate to
vigorous physical activity per week based on self-report in
both adolescence and adulthood. Alcohol consumption in
adolescence was defined as any episode of heavy drinking in
the previous year, characterized for men as 5 or more drinks
per drinking occasion and for women as 4 or more drinks per
drinking occasion. Alcohol consumption in adulthood was
defined for men as consuming more than 2 drinks per drink-
ing occasion and for women as consuming more than 1 drink
per drinking occasion.
At wave 1, adolescents were asked, "How many hours of
sleep do you usually get?" The current sleep recommenda-
tions for adolescents range from 8 to 9 hours of sleep per
night, depending on the entity that issued the recommenda-
tions (34). Short sleep duration in adolescence was defined
as fewer than 8 hours of sleep per night. In adulthood,
short sleep duration was defined as fewer than 6 hours of
sleep per night.
In adolescence and adulthood, height and weight were
measured by trained study staff in the participants' homes.
Body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) was calcu-
lated from measured height and weight. If measured height or
weight data were missing, self-reported height and weight
were used for BMI calculations. Because some of the adoles-
cents were younger than 18 years of age, we calculated BMI
percentiles, which account for the child's sex and age and are
considered to be more appropriate than the World Health Or-
ganization classification of obesity for adults based on BMI
(35). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2000
BMI growth references (36) were used to determine age-
and sex-specific BMI percentiles. In adulthood, BMI was cal-
culated from height and weight measured during home visits
by trained study staff.
Statistical analyses
After excluding 34 participants who reported a diabetes di-
agnosis in adolescence, we used logistic regression models
stratified by sex to estimate the associations of high levels
of depressive symptoms in adolescence, adulthood, and
both adolescence and adulthood with T2DM in adulthood.
The incidence of diabetes in the study sample was low
(3.4% among men and 3.8% among women).
We ran 3 models. The first model was adjusted for sociode-
mographic factors (age, educational level, and race/ethnicity).
The second model was adjusted for sociodemographic fac-
tors, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity,
and sleep duration during adulthood. The third model was
adjusted for sociodemographic factors, BMI, smoking, alco-
hol consumption, physical activity, and sleep duration in ad-
olescence and adulthood. All models were stratified by sex,
accounted for US region of residence and clustering at the
school level, and were weighted to account for the sampling
design (37). Analyses were carried out using SUDAAN, ver-
sion 11.0 (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina), according to the guidelines specified for the anal-
yses of Add Health Data (37).
Add Health used a school-based design in which the pri-
mary sampling units were schools, so we therefore accounted
for clustering at the school level. The poststratification vari-
able is the region of residence, and we thus stratified for re-
gion of residence as well. Sampling weights were calculated
by the Add Health investigators to account for the unequal
probability of selection of study participants. We used a lon-
gitudinal weight derived specifically for the sample of partic-
ipants who responded in waves 1­4 of follow-up. These
weights account for the inverse probability of retention in
the sample. Analyses of the wave 4 sample indicated negligi-
ble bias from nonresponse between wave 1 and wave 4 (22).
Formal tests for interaction were performed using a fully ad-
justed logistic regression interaction model that included var-
iables for sex and depression symptoms and an interaction
term that combined them. Depression symptoms were char-
acterized as occurring only in adulthood, only in adoles-
cence, or in both adolescence and adulthood. F-tests were
used to determine statistical significance.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the distribution of high levels of depressive
symptoms, T2DM, and study covariates. The sample com-
prised mostly white (67%) men and women who were an av-
erage of 29 years of age at the time of the wave 4 follow-up in
2007­2008. The incidence of T2DM was 3.4% in men and
3.8% in women. The majority of participants (76%) with
T2DM were not taking diabetes medications. A higher prev-
alence of depression symptoms was noted among women in
both adolescence and adulthood. In adolescence, 25% of
women and 15% men experienced high levels of depressive
symptoms (P < 0.05); in adulthood, 19% of women and 13%
of men experienced high levels of depressive symptoms (P <
0.05). Health behaviors in adulthood differed by sex in that
men were more likely to smoke, be physically active, and
sleep less than 6 hours per night in adulthood (P < 0.05)
(Table 1).
BMI in either adolescence or adulthood was associated
with the risk of T2DM among both men and women. No
health behavior during adolescence or adulthood was associ-
ated with T2DM among men or women (data not shown).
Short sleep duration and current smoking were associated
with high levels of depressive symptoms in both men and
women in adolescence and adulthood (Appendix Table 1).
Alcohol consumption in adolescence was associated with
high levels of depressive symptoms in both men and women
in adolescence. Greater physical activity in adolescence was
associated with lower odds of adolescent depression symp-
toms among men and women. Consumption of alcohol, as
defined in Methods, and greater physical activity were asso-
ciated with lower odds of depression symptoms among men
in adulthood (Appendix Table 1).
The incidence of T2DM varied by the presence of de-
pression symptoms (Table 2). Among women who did not

experience high levels of depressive symptoms in either ad-
olescence or adulthood, the incidence of T2DM was 3.0%;
among women who experienced high levels of depressive
symptoms in adolescence, adulthood, or both, it ranged
from 4.1% to 7.5%. Among men who did not experience
high levels of depressive symptoms, the incidence of T2DM
was 3.3%. The incidence of T2DM among men who experi-
enced high levels of depressive symptoms varied: Men with
high levels of depressive symptoms in adolescence only had
the highest incidence of T2DM, at 4.3%, and those who ex-
perienced high levels of depressive symptoms in both adoles-
cence and adulthood had the lowest incidence of T2DM, at
2.0%.
As shown in Table 3, after adjustment for sociodemo-
graphic factors, women who experienced high levels of depres-
sive symptoms in both adolescence and adulthood (compared
with women without high levels of depressive symptoms in
either period) had a higher risk of T2DM (odds ratio = 1.96,

95% confidence interval: 1.23, 3.11). The odds ratios were
not substantially different after adjustment for physical activ-
ity level, current smoking, BMI, alcohol consumption, and
short sleep duration in adolescence and adulthood. Among
men, no statistically significant associations between high
levels of depressive symptoms and T2DM were noted after
adjustment for sociodemographic factors. Upon adjustment
for physical activity, current smoking, BMI, alcohol use,
and short sleep duration, a lower odds ratio of T2DM was
noted among men who experienced high depression symp-
toms in both adolescence and adulthood (odds ratio = 0.39,
95% confidence interval: 0.17, 0.91). There was a significant
interaction between sex and chronic depression symptoms
(P = 0.01) (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In the present nationally representative longitudinal study,
we noted that high levels of depressive symptoms in both ad-
olescence and adulthood were associated with the onset of
T2DM among women. However, the same association was
not observed among men. These findings suggest that the
onset of depression early in life might set up a trajectory of
risk for T2DM among women.
Although sex-specific risks among adults have been sug-
gested in other studies, to our knowledge there has been no
other study in which sex differences in depression and diabe-
tes among younger populations have been examined (38).
Among adolescents, there is evidence of a sex-differentiated
association between depression and obesity. Similar to our
findings, in a study conducted among adolescents in New
Zealand, Richardson et al. (9) noted that depression in ado-
lescence was associated with obesity in adulthood among
girls only. Different coping mechanisms among men and
women have been proposed as explanations for sex differ-
ences in the development of metabolic disorders. However,
our analyses in which we examined behavioral factors in
adolescence and adulthood suggest a relationship between
weight status, health behaviors (sleep duration, physical ac-
tivity level, smoking status, and alcohol consumption), and
depression that is similar across sexes and therefore not likely
to account for the observed differences. Physiological sex
differences in the response to depression are plausible (e.g.,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation). In future
studies, investigators should explore whether sex-differentiated
responses to depression in relation to diabetes are explained
by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation or other
physiological pathways.
An association between symptoms of depression and
T2DM might be attributable to obesity and behavioral factors
such as lack of physical activity, smoking, alcohol consump-
tion, and short sleep duration. In our analyses, adjustment for

these factors did attenuate the association. A relationship be-
tween depressive symptomatology and higher BMI, as well
as lower dietary quality, has been reported previously (39).
Therefore, behavioral factors and obesity might account for
the association, and the potential relationship should be ex-
plored further.
The present study has some limitations. First, a screening
test rather than a diagnostic measure was used to identify de-
pression. However, the CES-D is a widely used test with
well-documented reliability and validity (29­32). Second, al-
though we adjusted for potential confounding factors such as
physical activity level, smoking, alcohol consumption, and
sleep duration, we have no information on dietary habits,
which were not assessed in the present study. Third, we did
not have information on laboratory-measured HbA1c
concen-
trations in adolescence, and we relied on self-reported diabe-
tes status before the adult assessment. However, because of
the low overall prevalence of T2DM among adolescents--
less than 1% (27, 40)--it is unlikely that the associations
we noted could be due to reverse causality. Fourth, although
we were able to assess a longitudinal relationship between de-
pressive symptoms in adolescence and T2DM in adulthood,
depressive symptoms and T2DM in adulthood were assessed
simultaneously; because of the cross-sectional nature of the
assessment, we cannot establish temporality. Finally, we re-
lied on measured HbA1c
concentrations and on the use of in-
sulin alone in adulthood to determine the type of diabetes in
the sample, as was done in other studies (27). We therefore
might have excluded persons with T2DM who were treated
solely with insulin and included persons with type 1 diabetes
mellitus who were treated with both metformin and insulin.
However, we expect this potential for misclassification of
T2DM to be small and not to be associated with high levels
of depressive symptoms. We were also unable to distinguish
cases of T2DM from maturity-onset diabetes of the young or
latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. However, maturity-onset
diabetes of the young is rare (41), and latent autoimmune dia-
betes in adults is typically not diagnosed until after the age of
35 years (older than all of the participants in the present study
were at follow-up) (41, 42); therefore, the potential for misclas-
sification is small.
The present study also has a number of strengths. We used
a nationally representative sample of US adolescents in high
school. The ethnic and geographic diversity of the present
sample increased its relevance and translatability to contem-
porary US adolescents. In addition, T2DM in adulthood was
assessed using objectively measured HbA1c
concentrations to
minimize possible measurement bias. Finally, we took a life-
course approach, examining the long-term impact of high lev-
els of depressive symptoms from adolescence into adulthood.
The rise in the rate of obesity during the past 2 decades has
led to a dramatic increase in the number of adolescents and
adults with T2DM, particularly among minority populations
(43). Our finding of a 3%­4% incidence of T2DM in a nation-
ally representative sample of 29-year-old persons, which is
higher than in previous samples (27, 44), warrants a focus on
the identification and prevention of risk factors early in the
life course. Because adolescents who are depressed are more
likely to be depressed as adults, it is prudent to begin preven-
tion efforts early.

a High levels of depressive symptoms were defined as a score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale of 16 or higher on the 20-item version (administered to the sample during adolescence) or 11 or higher on the
10-item version (used in the wave 4 follow-up interview in adulthood).
b Physical activity was defined by the number of bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week.
c BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2 for adults, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2000
BMI growth references (36) were used to determine BMI percentiles for adolescents.
d Alcohol consumption was defined in adolescence as any episode of binge drinking in the previous year. In
adulthood, alcohol consumption was defined for men as consuming more than 2 drinks per drinking occasion and
for women as consuming more than 1 drink per drinking occasion.
e Smoking was defined as current daily smoking of at least 1 cigarette per day in the previous 30 days.
f Short sleep duration was defined in adolescence as less than 8 hours of sleep per night and in adulthood as less
than 6 hours per night.
