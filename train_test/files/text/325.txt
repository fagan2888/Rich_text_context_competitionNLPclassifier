Young Women in the United States

OBJECTIVE: To understand whether and how recency of
sexual activity is associated with Pap testing rates among
young women.
METHODS: We analyzed data on self-reported receipt
of Pap testing and initiation of sexual activity among
young women and girls aged 15 to 24 years using the
2002 National Survey of Family Growth, an in-person,
population-based survey of reproductive-aged men and
women in the United States. The primary outcome was
receiving a Pap test and its relationship to initiation of
sexual activity. A multivariable model was used to predict
the probability of having had a Pap test in the previous 12
months.
RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the 2,513 women had
never had sex. Of these, 13.9% had had a Pap test in the
previous year. Sixty-seven percent of sexually-active
women aged 15-24 reported receiving a Pap test (corre-
sponding to 13.1 million tests). Approximately 59%
women aged 15­20 years old who reported having initi-
ated sexual activity in the previous 3 years also reported
a Pap test in the previous year.
CONCLUSION: The current guidelines recommend
screening 3 years after initiation of vaginal intercourse or
at age 21, whichever is earlier. Contrary to the current
guidelines, many young women who have not had sex or
who initiated sex within the previous 3 years reported
having had a Pap test. Assuming that the patterns ob-
served in this study persist, there is an urgent need for
education regarding the need to adhere to guidelines to
reduce the burden of potentially unnecessary Pap tests in
young women.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III
The initiation of sexual activity has been used as
a sentinel event to start cervical cancer screen-
ing in the United States. Previous guidelines in the
1990s advised women and their physicians to be-
gin screening at age 18 or on initiation of sexual
activity.1­3 Recent advances in cervical cancer screen-
ing and an improved understanding of the natural
history of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical
cancer have resulted in revised screening guidelines,
including raising the age at which to start screening.
In general, these newer guidelines recommend that a
woman's first Pap test be delayed to either 3 years
after first vaginal intercourse (one guideline says
within 3 years) or to age 21, whichever comes first.4­6
Therefore, it is important to study the linkage be-
tween age, first sex, and receipt of Pap testing to
inform current and future cervical cancer screening
guidelines. We examined the only national data
source that has information on both Pap testing and
age at first sex to understand whether and how
recency of sexual activity is associated with Pap
testing rates among young women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the National Center for
Health Statistics' institutional review board. The 2002
National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is an
in-person, population-based survey of both males and
females of reproductive age within households in the
United States. The survey is designed to be nationally
representative of females and males aged 15­44 years
living in the United States.7 The response rate was
80% among women and girls. Survey participants are
queried on a range of behaviors and attitudes related
to sexual intercourse, family planning, and family
growth. Women and girls aged 15­24 years as well as
Hispanic and African-American women were over-
sampled in the 2002 NSFG. Between March 2002 and
March 2003, a total of 2,513 women and girls aged
15­24 years representing 19.7 million females in the
United States, completed the interview.
The outcomes of interest in our analysis were
initiation of sexual activity and its relationship to
having a Pap test. Each female participant was asked,
"In the past 12 months, have you received a Pap test?"
Each female participant was asked if she had ever had
sexual intercourse using the question, "At any time in
your life, have you ever had sexual intercourse with a
man, that is, made love, had sex, or gone all the way?"
For the purposes of this part of the survey, intercourse
was defined as heterosexual vaginal intercourse. Re-
spondents who reported that they had ever had
heterosexual vaginal intercourse were defined as hav-
ing had sex. Additionally, each participant was asked
her age of first vaginal intercourse (age at first sex)
with the question "That very first time that you had
sexual intercourse with a man, how old were you?"
More than 99% of these respondents provided the
specific month and year at which first sexual inter-
course occurred. Our analysis was limited to younger
women, aged 15­24 years at the time of the interview,
to allow for recency of first sexual intercourse and to
allow us to capture key time periods (eg, 3 years after
first sexual intercourse).8 We examined age at time of
interview using single age categories and various
groups (younger than 18, younger than 21) based on
various screening guidelines.
A multivariable model was used to predict the
probability of having had a Pap test in the previous 12
months, with inclusion of the following potential
factors that may increase a visit to the doctor and
therefore increase likelihood of getting a Pap test: age
(15­17, 18­19, 20­21, 22­24 years), time since first
sex (no sex, within previous 12 months, within previ-
ous 24 months, and within previous 36 months, 37
months and over), race and Hispanic origin (white,
African American, Hispanic), mother's education
(less than high school, high school, some college,
bachelor's degree or higher), pregnancy in the previ-
ous 12 months (yes, no), current use of hormonal
contraceptives (yes, no), and receipt of public assis-
tance in the previous 12 months (yes, no). All analyses
were performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). Additionally, SUDAAN 9.0 (RTI International,
Research Triangle Park, NC) was used to take into
account the complex sample design of the NSFG.
RESULTS
About 67% of the respondents aged 15­24 have ever
had sex, corresponding to 13.1 million. The number
of women and girls who reported having had sex
increased with each additional year of life, and, by the
age of 22, 90.3% of women reported having had sex
(data not shown). Age-group differences by race and
ethnicity are shown in Figure 1. Although differences
among groups are not significant, there is a pattern of
higher levels of sexual experience for non-Hispanic
African-American compared with non-Hispanic
white and Hispanic young women, especially among
younger teens. At the age of 15 to 17 years, 30.0% of
non-Hispanic white women reported having had sex,
41.4% of non-Hispanic African-American women,
and 25.1% of Hispanic women. Although there were
racial and ethnic differences in proportions ever
having sex in younger age groups, by age 20­24,
similar percentages of women had had sex (non-
Hispanic whites 86.6%, non-Hispanic African Amer-
icans 88.7%, and Hispanics 89.5%) (Fig. 1). More than
half of women aged 15­24 years had received a Pap
test in the previous 12 months. Among young women
who had never had sex, Pap-test receipt varied by

age, ranging from 5.4% of 15-year-olds reporting a
Pap test within the previous year to 34.4% among the
20-year-olds (Table 1). Among girls under age 18 who
had not had sex, 6.8%, or 277,000, reported a Pap test
in the previous year; among those under age 21 who
had not had sex, 11.6% reported a Pap test in the
previous year; among those under age 25 who have not
had sex, 13.9% reported a Pap test in the previous year.
Differences by race and ethnicity were noted in
the likelihood of receiving a Pap test in the previous
12 months (Fig. 2); most differences were not signifi-
cant, except for Hispanics. Similar percentages of
non-Hispanic white and African-American women
and girls who had never had sex reported having had
a Pap test in the previous year (16.7% and 14.6%,
respectively), but the percentage was lower for com-
parable young Hispanic women (4.4%). Although not
all differences were significant, there is a clear pattern:
Hispanic women were less likely to have had a Pap test
in the previous year, regardless of time since first sex
(50.3% within 3 years or 67.2% in 3 or more years),
compared with non-Hispanic white women (62.8% and
80.0%, respectively) and non-Hispanic African-Ameri-
can women (66.6% and 79.0%, respectively).
Half of the respondents aged 15­24 who had sex
for the first time in the previous year had had a Pap
test within the previous year (Table 2). The longer it
had been since young women had had first sex, the
higher the percentage of women reporting a Pap test
in the previous 12 months. Among women aged
15­20 years who had first sex within previous 3 years,
58.5% reported a Pap test in the previous year,
compared with 78% for this age group that had first
sex 3 or more years previously.
Results from multivariable analysis predicting the
likelihood of having received a Pap test in the previ-
ous 12 months among 15- to 24-year-olds are shown
in Table 3. Controlling for the other factors in the
model (age, race, Hispanic origin, pregnancy in pre-
vious 12 months, current use of hormonal contracep-
tive, receipt of public assistance, and mother's educa-
tion), time since first sex was strongly related to the
likelihood of having had a Pap test in the previous
year. Young women who did not have sex were less
likely to have a Pap test than were those who had sex
within the previous 3 years. Those who first had sex
more than 3 years ago were even more likely than

those who had first sex within 3 years to have
received a Pap test. Currently using a hormonal
contraceptive and being pregnant in the previous 12
months were the most strongly and significantly re-
lated to an increased likelihood of having received a
Pap test. After controlling for the factors in the
multivariable model, race and Hispanic origin were
not related to the likelihood of receiving a Pap test
among young women aged 15­24 years.
DISCUSSION
In 2002, 13.9% of young women and girls under age
25 who had never had sex reported having had a Pap
test in the previous year; about 60% of the young
women and girls who had their first vaginal inter-
course within three years or less had had a Pap test
within the previous year. Whether one examines our
findings by the earlier screening guidelines on when
to start screening or by the current screening guide-
lines,9 the number of potentially unnecessary Pap tests
among young women and girls is important to docu-
ment. In 2002, when most respondents completed the
interview, the 1995 guidelines for performing cervical
cancer screening stated that women and girls should
be screened after initiating sexual intercourse or at
age 18, whichever is earlier. Given the sample and
design of this survey, we can extrapolate our findings
to the number of U.S. women. This means that
approximately 277,000 potentially unnecessary Pap
tests were performed on the 4 million girls under the
age of 18 years who had not had sex. The results also
can be examined using the 2002/2003 the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists/Ameri-
can Cancer Society Guidelines, which recommend
that screening begin approximately 3 years after onset
of sexual activity but no later than age 21. One
conservative estimate of the number of potentially
unnecessary Pap tests approaches 659,000 of the 5.7
million women and girls younger than 21 years who
have not had sex. In addition, among those women
and girls younger than 21, 2.9 million of the 4.8
million who had first sex within the previous 3 years
had a Pap test in the previous 12 months. Or,
alternatively, if one considers age 21, regardless of
sexual activity, there were approximately 4.7 million
women and girls younger than 21 who had had a Pap
test in the previous year.
Our analysis of current behaviors among women
and girls is important in the context of recent devel-
opments in cervical cancer prevention, screening, and
management. Cervical cancer is rare among young
women and girls. Between 1998 and 2003, there were
14 cases diagnosed among girls and women aged
15­19 years and 123 cases among women aged 20­24
years.10 Many studies show that the prevalence of
high-risk HPV infection is quite high among young
women and girls in the United States: 19% among
sexually active girls and women aged 14­19 years
and 29% among women aged 20­24 years.11 The long
latency period between initial HPV infection (which
is common soon after initiating sexual intercourse)
and the development of high-grade cervical disease
such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 and
cancer provides strong rationale for delaying screen-
ing. A concern with screening sooner than 3 years
after the onset of sexual activity is that screening is

likely to identify low-grade disease or HPV infection
that will be transient in nature.12 Recent changes to
guidelines reflect this concern: in girls and women up
to age 21, conservative management of lesions such as
CIN 1, CIN 2, or even CIN 3 now is recommended
because of the high rate of regression of these lesions
in this population.13 In addition, early, frequent
screening creates an unnecessary burden of cost to the
health care system and anxiety for the women who
learn of abnormal results and undergo repeated ex-
aminations. Additionally, treatment of transient HPV
cervical dysplasia in younger women is associated
with adverse pregnancy outcomes.14,15 A recent pro-
spective study in the United Kingdom shows that
screening women aged 20­24 years had no effect on
cervical cancer rates in women younger than 30.16
This study is limited by the self-reported nature of
survey data on sexual behavior and Pap tests. Studies
confirm that women are significantly more likely to
overreport Pap tests compared with documentation of
Pap tests in the medical record and to confuse the Pap
test with a pelvic examination.17­19 We found that the
prevalence of pelvic exams in the previous year was
slightly lower than the prevalence of Pap tests at each
single-year age group, possibly indicating less famil-
iarity with the pelvic examination terminology or
confusion with the terms.
The Pap tests reported are only those that oc-
curred in the 12 months preceding a respondent's
interview, not necessarily their first Pap test. There is
a possibility that many young women and girls might
have had their first Pap test earlier, and we may be
underestimating the number of women who might
have had their first Pap test and its relationship to
onset or recency of starting sex. We could not exam-
ine how many women were supposed to have a Pap
test but did not get it because the NSFG does not ask
women and girls whether they ever had a Pap test or
how often they get a Pap test.
The most recent survey of the NSFG was con-
ducted in 2002, during a time when screening guide-
lines were changing, so it may not be entirely fair to
compare our findings with the current guidelines, but
it gives us a sense of how onset and recency of sex are
associated with Pap testing. However, recent provider
surveys indicate that not much has changed since
2002. In a 2003 survey, 74% of obstetrician­gyne-
cologists reported that they would screen 18-year-old
women who had not had sex,20 and, in a 2006 survey,
72% of certified nurse midwives stated they would
screen 18-year-old women within 1 month of starting
sex.21 A 2007 primary care physician survey indicates
that half of physicians are likely to screen 18-year-old
sexually nonexperienced women and that more than
92% would screen an 18-year-old woman within 1
month of first sex (Yabroff KR, Saraiya M, Meissner

tional survey, 2006 to 2007. Ann Intern Med. In

Pap tests in younger women and girls. Pap testing is
common among young females who are receiving
other reproductive health care.22 The practice of
linking Pap tests with both receipt of hormonal contra-
ception and prenatal care also has been documented in
previous studies,23,24 and they continue to be strongly

associated with getting a Pap test. In addition, concerns
about litigation, the misconception that cervical cancer
is common and 100% preventable in young women,
and a lower awareness of the natural history of HPV and
cervical cancer also may play a role.
If the patterns observed in this study have per-
sisted, there may be a need for further education and
stronger interventions (ie, reminders, lack of reim-
bursement) regarding current guidelines. Our current
understanding of the course of HPV infection in the
majority of girls and young women and the financial
and clinical burden of screening them underscores the
importance of providers' understanding the need for
an increased interval between the age at which pa-
tients report their first vaginal intercourse and the age
at which they receive their first Pap test. Additionally,
these findings can help inform cost-effectiveness stud-
ies on current screening practices among girls and
young women, especially as HPV vaccination cover-
age increases. Because there are many unanswered
questions related to the HPV vaccine, such as dura-
tion of protection, any change in screening recom-
mendations as a result of the HPV vaccine is still years
away. Currently, those who have received the vaccine
should continue to be screened regularly for cervical
cancer, according to guidelines.25 Recommendations
for when to start screening among fully HPV-vacci-
nated girls and women (especially those who have
been screened before having had sex) have not
changed, but experts predict that they are likely to
change in the future.26 Cost-effectiveness studies have
suggested that both a change in the age to start
screening (25 years) and how often to screen (every
3­5 years) would make the most epidemiological and
economic sense.27,28 As the paradigm for cervical
cancer screening and prevention changes, continuous
monitoring of preventive behaviors, policies, and
interventions about timing of first sex, timing of first
Pap, HPV DNA testing, and HPV vaccines will be
important to ensure that newer technologies are being
accompanied by evidence-based practices.
