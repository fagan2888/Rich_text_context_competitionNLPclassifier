Abstract
Introduction: Major trauma is a leading cause of death and disability in young adults, especially from massive non-
compressible torso haemorrhage. The standard technique to control distal haemorrhage and maximise central perfusion
is resuscitative thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping (RTACC). More recently, the minimally invasive technique of
resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has been developed to similarly limit distal haemor-
rhage without the morbidity of thoracotomy; cost­utility studies on this intervention, however, are still lacking. The aim
of this study was to perform a one-year cost­utility analysis of REBOA as an intervention for patients with major
traumatic non-compressible abdominal haemorrhage, compared to RTACC within the U.K.'s National Health Service.
Methods: A retrospective analysis of the outcomes following REBOA and RTACC was conducted based on the pub-
lished literature of survival and complication rates after intervention. Utility was obtained from studies that used the EQ-
5D index and from self-conducted surveys. Costs were calculated using 2016/2017 National Health Service tariff data
and supplemented from further literature. A cost­utility analysis was then conducted.
Results: A total of 12 studies for REBOA and 20 studies for RTACC were included. The mean injury severity scores for
RTACC and REBOA were 34 and 39, and mean probability of death was 9.7 and 54%, respectively. The incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio of REBOA when compared to RTACC was £44,617.44 per quality-adjusted life year. The incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio, by exceeding the National Institute for Health and Clinical Effectiveness's willingness-to-pay
threshold of £30,000/quality-adjusted life year, suggests that this intervention is not cost-effective in comparison to
RTACC. However, REBOA yielded a 157% improvement in utility with a comparatively small cost increase of 31.5%.
Conclusion: Although REBOA has not been found to be cost-effective when compared to RTACC, ultimately, clinical
experience and expertise should be the main factor in driving the decision over which intervention to prioritise in the
emergency context.

Introduction
Trauma accounts for 12,500 deaths across England and
Wales each year and is the leading cause of death in
those aged 44 and under.1 There are an estimated
20,000 cases of major trauma in England annually
and the burden is set to increase over the next 20
years, posing a major public health problem.1,2 Major
trauma is defined as an injury severity score (ISS)
greater than 15.1,3 Whilst extremity haemorrhage is
amenable to direct control via compression or proximal
tourniquet application, massive bleeding within the
chest or abdomen is not and is referred to as non-
compressible torso haemorrhage (NCTH). Without
intervention, severe NCTH leads to exsanguinating
cardiac arrest. Interventions are typically aimed at tem-
porarily halting distal haemorrhage whilst maintaining

central (cardiac and cerebral) perfusion followed by a
definitive procedure at the site of bleeding.
First performed in 1900, resuscitative thoracotomy
with aortic cross-clamping (RTACC) is the current
standard and most commonly performed intervention
following NCTH, despite being hugely invasive with
significant associated complications.4,5 Resuscitative
endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta
(REBOA) is a less invasive method of aortic occlusion,
first reported during the Korean War in 1954. It
feeds an endovascular balloon into the aorta via the
femoral artery; it can then be inflated to occlude
distal flow in the aorta, limiting haemorrhage and
maintaining central perfusion. In large animal models
and several human studies, REBOA has demonstrated
its potential in terms of minimal invasiveness, improved
survival rate,6­9 increased blood pressure,7,10,11 and
improved brain oxygenation and carotid arterial
blood flow.11,12 Despite promising initial findings,
data regarding complications are still lacking and will
be needed before widespread implementation is likely
to occur. In addition, the limited availability of eco-
nomic evaluations of REBOA serves as another barrier
to its adoption.
One of the methods by which the National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ascertains the
cost-effectiveness of health interventions is a cost­utility
analysis.13 This allows the comparison of two interven-
tions whose measurable outcomes, measured in quality-
adjusted life years (QALY), and clinical pathways may
differ but address the same problem. Utility, which is a
component of QALYs, refers to the satisfaction derived
from consuming a good. In health economics, it is essen-
tially an indication of the preference and therefore, qual-
ity of life associated with a particular health state; a score
of 1 being perfectly healthy and 0 being death.14 Thus,
QALYs are a weighted measure of utility, taking into
consideration the extra life years a patient might live at
an adjusted quality of life. For example, a patient who
undergoes a procedure that gives him another 10 years to
live with a utility of 0.8 for the period would gain eight
QALYs (0.8 Â 10 years). A cost­utility analysis ultim-
ately yields a single comparable measure termed the incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which describes
the cost per QALY gained by one intervention over the
other; the ICER is then compared to the health system's
willingness to pay (WTP) in making decisions to fund
health interventions.15 As an example, an ICER of
£18,000 means two things: the procedure in question deli-
vers gains in QALYs over its comparator; and each
QALY gained over its comparator costs £18,000.
Within the NHS, the WTP remains at £20,000­£30,000,
hence if the ICER is less than the WTP, then an interven-
tion is deemed cost-effective and would be recommended
by NICE for NHS funding.
The aim of this study is to perform a cost­utility
analysis of REBOA as an intervention for patients
with major traumatic NCTH above the aortic bifurca-
tion within the abdomen compared to RTACC, the
current gold standard.3,16 In the current climate of
financial constraints, this study may ultimately support
emergency clinicians in deciding which intervention to
prioritise in their departments in this subset of patients
within the NHS setting.
Methodology
Search criteria
PUBMED, Google Scholar and OvidSP were initially
searched using the terms: `REBOA (Resuscitative
Endovascular Occlusion of the Aorta)', `endovascular
occlusion', `Resuscitative Thoracotomy', `Emergency
Thoracotomy', `Aortic Cross Clamping', `Cost
Analysis', `Cost Utility', `Major Trauma', `Major
Haemorrhage', `Injury Severity', `Survival',
`Complications', `Side-Effects', `Indications'. This
search enabled the development of the decision trees
and generation of a list of complications associated with
both REBOA and RTACC. To generate the complica-
tions' data pertaining to the survival rates and utility after
initial intervention, PUBMED, Google Scholar and
OvidSP were again searched. This time the key terms
included the complications: `REBOA (Resuscitative
Endovascular Occlusion of the Aorta)', `Endovascular
Occlusion', `Resuscitative Thoracotomy', `Emergency
Thoracotomy', `Aortic Cross Clamping', `Intervention',
`Surgery', `Laparoscopic Packing', `Utility', `Quality Of
Life' (QOL), `EQ-5D', `Traumatic', `Haemothorax',
`Limb Ischaemia', `Necrosis', `Amputation',
`Empyema', `Reoperation', `Infection', `Sepsis',
`Pneumonia', `Thrombosis', `Deep Vein Thrombosis',
`Dialysis', `Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)', `Neurological
Impairment', `Intensive Care', `Major trauma',
`Disability' and `Mortality'. Studies were included if
they reported on the QOL or mortality of the complica-
tion regardless of the cause. This was done due to the
inability to obtain relevant studies reporting on the indi-
vidual complication in a subgroup of patients with
NCTH. Studies were excluded if the full text was inaccess-
ible for free, if they did not report QOL in the EQ-5D
format (for QoL data) or if they were not in English. The
list of complications was taken from literature reporting
the use of either RTACC or REBOA which reported a
complication directly attributable to these interventions.
Due to the limited data available regarding utility and
QoL from complications directly associated with
REBOA and RTACC, these values were preferentially
taken from studies where patients had undergone major
trauma and had these complications, although these were
2 Trauma 0(0)
also scarce. Most of these values were obtained from stu-
dies reporting on non-trauma patients as these were the
only data available. Where no data existed at all, the util-
ity of the complication was estimated by consultation of
medical professionals. Although this was the largest limi-
tation of the study, small changes in utility data did not
impact the overall findings, as demonstrated in the sensi-
tivity analysis (Table S4).
Literature review
Published evidence on the use of either intervention is
of low quality, with much less literature on the use of
REBOA. Due to the nature of the setting in which they
are used, randomised controlled trials are difficult to
perform. There was a significant heterogeneity of
patients included and we chose not to differentiate
between blunt and penetrating trauma in our analysis,
in an effort to approximate the setting as close to real-
world clinical practice as possible as some studies did
not discriminate outcomes based on the mechanism of
injury. Pertaining to complications, this study only
included those that were likely to lead to different
levels of reimbursements for hospital trusts in the
NHS and for which there was clear evidence of direct
causation by either REBOA or RTACC.
The studies used in this analysis are listed in the
online supplementary information and a breakdown
of included study numbers can be seen in Figure 1.
Only patients sustaining NCTH were included as this
is the only indication for REBOA. A meta-analysis of
survival rates and clinical outcomes was primarily
used to collect data for RTACC outcomes, including
survival rates, number of procedures performed and
numbers of patients who survived with residual neuro-
logical impairment.17 Other studies with data regarding
complications and neurological outcomes were added
but not duplicated with any studies already included.
There is one included cost­utility analysis of RTACC
that was accessible in the literature but none for
REBOA.18
This analysis obtained information regarding
REBOA predominantly from Morrison et al.'s19 sys-
tematic review and the DuBose et al.20 study whose
patients had suffered traumatic NCTH. One study
was excluded from this analysis as the abstract was
not available, and an additional study was excluded
as it did not represent a case of trauma.19,20 The exclu-
sion criteria used meant that the full paper had to be
available, each case had to be related to trauma where
REBOA or RTACC was used before a further inter-
vention occurred, could not be a case report and men-
tioned the outcomes of their patient populations. This
meant that two studies were excluded from the REBOA
arm and one from the RTACC arm.
Several studies stated the amount of blood products
used; however, the majority did not and so this study
calculated a weighted average of the units of red blood
cells (RBCs) used as this had the highest volume of
evidence. It was assumed that all patients were uncon-
scious whilst the procedure was being performed, in
which case intubation would be required.21,22 There
are a wide range of survival rates reported for both
techniques which may be due to varying sample sizes,
severity of injury and variability of the procedures per-
formed after the haemorrhage control intervention.23,24
Additionally, although REBOA is being increasingly
performed in the U.K. and Japan, RTACC remains
the standard in the US where a significant amount of
data was collected.
Complication rates likewise varied greatly across
the studies, with most simply reporting that they
were observed without providing specific figures. The
meta-analysis did not include complication rates and
therefore, other studies were used. Similarly, RTACC
studies reported a wide range of neurological out-
comes, with impairment rates reported between 0
and 50%.25 No neurological impairment was reported
in patients who underwent REBOA. There was insuf-
ficient data on the length of stay of patients in either
the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or the general ward, as
well as the duration spent on a ventilator. Therefore,
data from Campbell et al.26 were used in this analysis.
The most applicable studies to determine the utility
values of complications were chosen based on their
reference to patients undergoing trauma, the ISS or
patient population being similar to that of this
study. Individual complication values pertaining utility
and mortality were applied to instances of NCTH as
no other data were available with stronger links to
major trauma.
Decision tree
The decision tree for patients undergoing REBOA was
designed by primarily using data from Morrison et al.19
and for RTACC from Rhee et al.17 Complications
related to access were excluded as they did not have
any important sequelae as were complications that
were not directly attributed to the intervention, such

The probability of each chance node was calculated
using the weighted probability of the studies reporting
the occurrence of the event, according to the number of
patients involved. Where there were no data, the study
was excluded from the calculations. Overall probabil-
ities of each chance node add up to 1. Costs and utilities
were added and attributed to the relevant nodes.
Further information explaining the decision tree
nodes can be found in the supplementary information's
Methodology section.
Discounting
Due to the nature of the injuries, according to
Holbrook et al.,29 either patients make a near total
recovery within the first year post-injury or they do
not survive to discharge; for this reason, a one-year
evaluation was conducted and as the majority of the
costs were incurred within this year, no discounting
was performed.
Financial costs
The costs of these interventions have been evaluated
from a U.K. NHS perspective, not taking into consid-
eration productivity losses or other indirect societal
costs. The majority of the costs were obtained from
the NHS reference costs or tariffs30 with several notable
exceptions. The blood products which are `unbundled'
or additional expenses were calculated in addition to
the core spell tariff using the NICE costing guidelines
on blood transfusion.31 The amount of blood needed
per procedure was obtained from the literature. In add-
ition, the cost of the REBOA kit was added onto the
core spell tariff as it is unlikely that such a novel treat-
ment has been taken into consideration when setting
the reference cost for treating major trauma. The cost
of this kit was obtained directly from the retailer at its
current retail price.32 Patients who experienced a neuro-
logical event were costed with a neurological event
spell; however, those who were discharged with residual
neurological impairment were given an additional cost
of neurological rehabilitation for a year. This cost was
obtained from the literature, based on a 2009 figure and
inflated accordingly.33
All costs were in pounds (£) and did not require
conversion. All costs were 2016/2017 values with the
exception of the blood products, which were inflated
to 2017 costs, and the neurological rehabilitation. The
data used to inflate costs were based on the consumer
price index from the Office for National Statistics.34
Discounting was not applied as all costs were incurred
within a year.
Costs of REBOA and RTACC
Following a serious injury, patients were modelled to
receive either REBOA or RTACC as emergency meas-
ures to stabilise the patient until they are able to receive
definitive care. The cost of these interventions was
based on a multiple trauma diagnoses core spell
which was obtained from the NHS tariffs.30 The NHS
discriminates trauma costs based on the ISS which was
obtained from the literature, as well as the Therapeutic
Intervention Score which was obtained through the
modelling of a typical major trauma patient.35 This
was done to select the most accurate tariff. Costs of
the blood products which were obtained from the lit-
erature were added to the core spell tariff.
Following the REBOA or RTACC intervention,
those patients who survived would then require a
more definitive intervention (laparotomy or angioem-
bolisation) for the abdominal bleeding regardless of
which initial intervention was received. These costs
were obtained using the NHS tariff then weighted
against the likelihood of each patient undergoing the
procedure to provide one cost which was named `defini-
tive intervention'.30
Cost of complications
The most common complications that were reported in
the literature were included as well as the less common
complications but which had either a high cost or sig-
nificantly lower quality of life such as leg amputation.
The cost of these procedures and treatments were based
on the tariff costs.30 Most of these costs were inpatient,
except for patients who were discharged home requiring
dialysis, and those with neurological impairment,
whose costs were calculated as outpatient. The cost of
treating neurological impairment per year was obtained
from the literature.32 The cost of an outpatient dialysis
session was obtained from the NHS tariffs and multi-
plied by the total number of expected sessions/year.
As the injury considered is critical multi-trauma, all
complications were assumed to be major and associated
with complexity and comorbidity as defined by the
NHS in their tariff stratification. Finally, for those tar-
iffs that stratified the costs according to age, the `19 and
over' category was chosen as the average age of patients
who present with major trauma is greater than 30 in the
literature. The tariffs which were most relevant and rep-
resentative were selected for each condition in order to
make the total cost as accurate as possible.
QALYs
Each end node QALY displayed in the decision trees
represents the sum of all the utilities for each health
4 Trauma 0(0)
state (quality of life scores (QoLs)) multiplied by the
length of life (LOL) for that corresponding state.
The QoLs have a value between 0 and 1, which
represents death and perfect health, respectively. The
LOL value represents the LOL (in years) spent in a
particular health state. All LOL values were obtained
from the literature. QoL scores were obtained from
either the literature or direct assessment using EQ-5D
questionnaires. The EQ-5D is a standardised numerical
measure of health outcomes, used by NICE. The EQ-
5D was the chosen measure of utility for this analysis as
the questionnaire and resources are openly accessible
and it allowed for the calculation of utility/QoL
scores for complications where QoL values were not
available in the literature based on self-conducted
surveys.
In the context of NCTH, it has been assumed that
irrespective of the intervention (RTACC or REBOA),
patients are ventilated for the same amount of days
on average (three days), spend 4.93 days in the ICU
and 19.58 days in the ward. The QoL scores for
each of these health states, therefore, have been
assumed to be equal 0, 0.286 and 0.730, respectively.
If a complication arises after intervention, the LOL for
the number of days in the ward is reduced, such that the
number of days in the complication state and number
of days in the ward totals 19.58 days. The study follows
the patient for a total of one year, thus the LOL of the
final health state of the patient pathway totals 337.49
days. Discounting of QALYs was not done as this is a
one-year evaluation.
ICER
The costs and QALYs of comparative treatments were
calculated from the decision tree. The ICER was calcu-
lated using the equation

Decision trees

vention can be seen in Figures 2 and 3. Detailed ana-
lysis of how each value was derived can be found in the
supplementary information (REBOA Probabilities and
RTACC Probabilities section).

These values were derived from literature; the total
utility is the sum of weighted utility of each branch,
taking into consideration the probability of a patient
undertaking an event and the outcome from that spe-
cific event. The total costs were calculated by taking the
sum cost of each intervention or complication using the
NHS tariffs for 2016/2017 and weighting them against
the probability of use. This information was found
from literature and detailed in the supplementary infor-
mation (Methodology section). This ICER value means
that for each QALY gained by using REBOA instead
of RTACC, it will cost an extra £44,617.44. The posi-
tive cost and positive QALY difference denote that
there is a trade-off. REBOA is more effective than
RTACC but also costlier, thus acceptance of REBOA
as a more effective intervention is dependent on the
maximum WTP. In the U.K., the WTP per QALY
gained is £20,000­£30,000 for general treatment, so
REBOA would not be deemed more cost-effective for
clinical use according to the NHS as it is higher than
the threshold.
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis was performed using alternative
values available from published literature. The analysis
used the minimum and maximum values for probability
of survival from either REBOA or RTACC and the
intervention (node B1/2). It also assessed the minimum
and maximum cost of REBOA or RTACC, the cost in
relation to the ISS, addition of blood products used as
well as the proportion of patients undergoing angioem-
bolisation or laparotomy and packing. Finally, the
impact of variation in utility was assessed using the
minimum and maximum values for the EQ-5D values.
The values used can be found in the supplementary
information (Table S4). This was performed to assess
whether alternative data values from the literature
yielded significant changes to cost-effectiveness
outcomes.
Discussion
The main aim of this study was to assess the cost­utility
of using REBOA compared to RTACC from an NHS
perspective in the subset of critically ill patients who
have NCTH. The ICER for REBOA in this study
was £44,617.44 suggesting that, according to current
NICE thresholds, this intervention would not be
deemed cost-effective. Importantly, one of the main
Renna et al. 5
predictors of outcome, the ISS, was similar in both sets
of patients, making these interventions comparable
clinically.
The large ICER has several possible explanations.
RTACC involves less costly equipment, whereas the
REBOA kit itself costs close to £1000.33 The improve-
ment in utility provided by REBOA is small at only
0.102 in absolute terms, despite a 157% relative
improvement in utility. This means that although a
small absolute increase in how well a patient is doing
is observed, mainly due to the high mortality rates seen
in this type of trauma, the study suggests that from a
clinical point of view, REBOA provides considerable
benefits, giving outcomes 157% higher than using
RTACC. Therefore, a patient will have a much higher
chance of surviving NCTH if REBOA is used instead of
RTACC. The relative increase in costs is nonetheless
less at 31.5%. The utility of RTACC may be overstated
due to the fact that there was poor quality data based
on studies that did not follow-up their patients nor
include complications; furthermore, as there is more
experience using RTACC, there were more patients

than for REBOA, which may have led to a bias.
Additionally, there was a greater amount of RBC
units used in the REBOA group compared to
RTACC. Finally, the probability of surviving to defini-
tive intervention following REBOA was greater, lead-
ing to an accrual of costs to the system, which are not
compensated by a sufficient improvement in the utility
of these patients.
This is the first cost­utility analysis comparing these
two interventions, although the rationale for looking at
cost in such critically ill patients, who have very poor
outcomes to begin with, might be disputed from a
clinical point of view. In 2007, Brown concluded that
RTACC costs $16,125 per QALY when compared to
no intervention.18 When this is converted into pounds,
at the March 2017 exchange rate of $1.23/£ and
adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index,
would equate to approximately £17,185.20.36 The
Brown study differed from this analysis in several
ways, notably in its setting, the USA, with greater
healthcare costs overall; the utility at discharge of 1
and the comparator being no treatment.13 It is import-
ant to note that no market forces factors were taken
into account when calculating costs because this

analysis was from the perspective of the NHS and not
from an individual hospital.
This study looked at how changes in the probabil-
ities impacted the ICER. Of the survival data, the
ICER was most sensitive to changes to the probability
of death following REBOA. When the minimum
reported probability of survival to definitive interven-
tion and after definitive intervention were used, the
change in ICER was 152.82 and 226.79%, respect-
ively. In terms of cost, of the variables analysed, the
one that impacted the ICER most was the number of
RBC units used in the RTACC arm, with the maximal
reported use yielding a 62.12% change in ICER.
For the utilities, the focus was on assessing the
impact of the self-conducted survey on the ICER.
Virtually no change occurred, with the largest ICER
fluctuation of 0.64% occurring with the lowest utility
for ICU stay.
Of this analysis only, three ICER changes led to a
value that was within NICE's WTP threshold. These
were maximum use of RBC in the RTACC arm,
having no complications in the RTACC arm, and
having a probability of survival to definitive interven-
tion of 1 in the REBOA arm. Of all the variables exam-
ined in this sensitivity analysis, survival was the one
that impacted the ICER the most. REBOA survival
was the most impactful because those who survive to
discharge have a considerably better outcome than
those who survive RTACC. The upper limit of the
NICE threshold is £30,000 per QALY, thus REBOA
would not be recommended by NICE solely based on
the NHS' WTP.13
This study does have a number of limitations, many
of them derived from the numerous assumptions that
had to be made which are summarised in the online
supplementary information (Table S5). These mostly
arise from the poor quality of evidence available in
the literature for both arms of this study. No study
was able to randomise patients and was performed in
units with variable experiences in using the techniques,
thus reducing standardisation. Several gaps in the
information available meant that probabilities had to
be calculated from a small data set and explain why
many assumptions were made. Importantly, several
complications could not be attributed to the procedure
itself and had to be excluded altogether. The analysis
was limited to outcomes over one year and so costs are
likely to be underestimated and benefits overestimated
over the course of a lifetime. Evidence-based QoL was
used where possible, and utility was based on Ringburg
et al.'s paper.37 This report may also have included
patients who did not sustain abdominal trauma as
part of their multiple injuries as there were no studies
in whom all patients had sustained abdominal trauma,
with or without other types of trauma, and thus this
utility may not be fully generalisable. As a result, the
analysis included papers reporting the mortality and
QoL of the complications in non-traumatic patients
although, where possible, post-traumatic patients were
included even though they did not have NCTH. This
admittedly reduces the relevance of our data; however,
the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that small changes
in utility would not change the overall outcome
(Table S4). There was no data on the utility of patients
who were unconscious, intubated and ventilated; thus,
it was assumed to be 0. Furthermore, there were little
data available on the utility of several health states and
so a self-conducted EQ-5D survey was performed on
several experienced medical professionals in order to
achieve a consensus view.
Conclusion
The objective of this report was to evaluate the cost­
utility of a novel treatment for major trauma. Based on
the findings of this study, according to NICE thresh-
olds, REBOA has not been found to be cost-effective
when compared to RTACC. Due to both the poor
quality of studies used and the limited number
of patients included in the REBOA arm of this analysis,
we feel our results should be interpreted with caution.
Importantly, the aim of this study was not to recom-
mend which intervention should be used over the
other, but provide information supporting clinical
decision-making in a cost-constrained NHS setting.
Ultimately, clinical experience and expertise should be
the main factor in driving the decision over which inter-
vention to prioritise. This study acts as a starting
point in understanding which intervention is more
cost-effective, although further research is needed for a
more robust analysis of these interventions. Compared
to RTACC, REBOA is a relatively new intervention,
so greater experience with it may ultimately lead to
better outcomes in the future and consequently a more
favourable ICER.

the decision tree graphics and CVZ gathered more specific
data on the RTACC arm and analysed the contraindications.
FA-H analysed the costs of each treatment. CT, MM and JG
gathered detailed data for the QOLs and performed the cal-
culations for them. MSR and CT performed the sensitivity
analysis. MSR, CT, FA-H and CVZ edited the first draft,
with MSR and CT working on the final drafts.
