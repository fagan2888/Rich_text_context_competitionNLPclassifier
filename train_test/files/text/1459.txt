Background--National guidelines for primary prevention suggest consideration of lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease
in addition to 10-year risk, but it is currently unknown how many US adults would be identified as having low short-term
but high lifetime predicted risk if stepwise stratification were used.
Methods and Results--We included 6329 cardiovascular disease­free and nonpregnant individuals ages 20 to 79 years,
representing approximately 156 million US adults, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2004
and 2005 to 2006. We assigned 10-year and lifetime predicted risks to stratify participants into 3 groups: low 10-year
(10%)/low lifetime (39%) predicted risk, low 10-year (10%)/high lifetime (39%) predicted risk, and high 10-year
(10%) predicted risk or diagnosed diabetes. The majority of US adults (56%, or 87 million individuals) are at low short-term
but high lifetime predicted risk for cardiovascular disease. Twenty-six percent (41 million adults) are at low short-term and
low lifetime predicted risk, and only 18% (28 million individuals) are at high short-term predicted risk. The addition of
lifetime risk estimation to 10-year risk estimation identifies higher-risk women and younger men in particular.
Conclusions--Whereas 82% of US adults are at low short-term risk, two thirds of this group, or 87 million people, are at
high lifetime predicted risk for cardiovascular disease. These results provide support for use of a stepwise stratification
system aimed at improving risk communication, and they provide a baseline for public health efforts aimed at increasing
the proportion of Americans with low short-term and low lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease. (Circ Cardiovasc
Qual Outcomes. 2010;3:8-14.)

The majority of US adults, particularly women and
younger men, are at low short-term risk (10% in 10
years) for a coronary event by National Cholesterol Educa-
tion Program/Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III)
guidelines.1­3 However, this large "low-risk" population com-
prises those who remain low risk as well as those who
become high risk across the lifespan. We previously devel-
oped an algorithm to predict lifetime risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and found that risk factors measured at age 50
years effectively stratified Framingham Study participants to
a spectrum of observed lifetime CVD rates (5.2% to 68.9%)
and median survivals (39 to 28 years).4 These patterns were
similar in contemporary US multi-ethnic cohorts for risk
factors measured at various ages.5 Furthermore, we recently
used this algorithm to investigate the implications of long-term
predicted risk for CVD specifically among those at low 10-year
predicted risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).6 Even at
younger ages (32 to 50 years), individuals with low (10%)
short-term but high (39%) lifetime predicted risk had greater-
burden and progression of subclinical CVD compared with the
low short-term and low (39%) lifetime risk group.6
Editorial see p 4
Recognizing that current risk assessment strategies may
inadequately assess CVD risk in many women and younger
men, US national guidelines from the NCEP7 and the Amer-
ican Heart Association8 now endorse consideration of life-
time risk in primary prevention. Although pharmacotherapy
based on lifetime risk is not specifically recommended in the
guidelines, it is recommended that those at high lifetime risk
receive intensified lifestyle counseling and risk factor moni-

toring. Furthermore, specific lifetime risk estimates may be
used to enhance risk communication and motivation for
patients with high predicted lifetime risk but low predicted
short-term risk, as well as to assist policy makers and
researchers seeking to understand current or project future
CVD burden. However, a formal method for synthesizing
information about 10-year and lifetime risks is not currently
provided. A stepwise stratification system whereby individ-
uals with low short-term predicted risk are then evaluated for
lifetime predicted risk could accomplish this, but the potential
utility of designating a low short-term/high lifetime risk
group of Americans would be better appreciated if the
population prevalence of this group were known. Therefore,
we applied our previously published lifetime risk algorithm to
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2003 to 2006 dataset to estimate the numbers of
US adults in each of 3 risk groups: low short-term CHD/low
lifetime CVD, low short-term CHD/high lifetime CVD, and
high short-term CHD predicted risk.
Methods
Study Participants
We included CVD-free, nonpregnant participants ages 20 to 79 years
who completed a mobile examination in the 2003 to 2004 or 2005 to
2006 NHANES (n7396), which provided representative samples of
the noninstitutionalized US population9 targeted by the NCEP/ATP
III for cardiovascular risk prediction.7 We defined participants as
having CVD if they answered "yes" when asked if a doctor or health
professional ever told them they had CHD, heart attack, stroke, or
congestive heart failure. We excluded participants with missing
values for blood pressure (n698), cholesterol (n306), or height or
weight (n63) to obtain our final study sample (n6329) (Supple-
mental Figure 1). For self-reported data, answers other than "yes"
were assumed to be "no."
Risk Factor Ascertainment
We defined CVD risk factors as follows. Diabetes mellitus was
defined by self-reported health professional­diagnosed diabetes (but
not "borderline" diabetes); cigarette smoking was defined by self-
report of currently smoking every day or some days and having
smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime; and antihypertensive and
lipid-lowering medication use was also defined by self-report. Blood
pressure measures were performed by trained and certified physi-
cians using previously described procedures and a mercury manom-
eter9; the average of the last 2 measurements were used whenever
available, although single measurements were used if they were the
only available measurements. Total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol were measured as described previously.9 Obesity was
defined as body mass index 30 kg/m2.
Definitions of Risk Strata
We determined the distribution of 3 risk strata in the US population:
low 10-year/low lifetime, low 10-year/high lifetime, and high 10-
year predicted risk, as defined below. For the main analysis, we
calculated 10-year predicted risk for hard CHD (myocardial infarc-
tion or coronary death) for all participants using the ATP III risk
assessment tool,10 and we defined a calculated risk of 10% or
diagnosed diabetes as "high 10-year predicted risk" because individ-
uals with this level of predicted risk would potentially be eligible for
intensive preventive measures, including drug therapy.7 Among the
participants with low (10%) 10-year predicted risk (and no
diabetes), we assigned lifetime predicted risk for CVD (myocardial
infarction, coronary insufficiency, angina, atherothrombotic stroke,
intermittent claudication, or CVD death) using our previously
published algorithm,4,6 as shown in Table 1. We defined "low
lifetime predicted risk" as the 2 lower risk strata ("all optimal" or
"1 not optimal" risk factors), which, according to our prior work,
have predicted lifetime risk 39%,4 and "high lifetime predicted
risk" as the 3 higher risk strata ("1 elevated," "1 major" or "2
major" risk factors), which have predicted lifetime risk 39%.4 This
stratification was chosen a priori based on the previously observed
apparent natural separation in lifetime risks of these 2 groups in the
Framingham cohorts4 as well as in a large pooled sample of US
multi-ethnic cohorts.5 It has been further justified with recent work
demonstrating differential burden and progression of subclinical athero-
sclerosis in younger adults using the identical stratification algorithm.6
In further analyses, we also included obesity (body mass index
30 kg/m2) and low HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dL for men, 50
mg/dL for women) as major risk factors. To examine whether a more
stringent definition of low short-term risk would weaken the distinc-

Lifetime risk refers to risk of all atherosclerotic CVD (myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, angina, atherothrombotic stroke, intermittent claudication, or CVD
death). An individual's risk stratum is the highest risk stratum for which any of the individual's risk factors are eligible.4
*In a secondary analysis, obesity (body mass index 30 kg/m2) and low HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dL for a man or 50 mg/dL for a woman) were also counted
as major risk factors. Lifetime risk estimates for this secondary stratification are not shown but are similar to those above.

tion of different lifetime predicted risk groups among those at low
short-term predicted risk, we also repeated the primary stratification
described above using 2 additional definitions of short-term risk. For
the first, we defined low short-term risk as 6% predicted 10-year
risk for hard CHD (and absence of diabetes) using the ATP III risk
assessment tool.10 For the second, we defined low short-term risk as
20% predicted 10-year risk for total CVD (coronary death,
myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, angina, ischemic
stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, intermittent
claudication, or heart failure) (and absence of diabetes) using the risk
functions published by D'Agostino et al.11
Statistical Analysis
We used survey procedures in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) to generate accurate frequencies and variances accounting for
the complex, multistage design of the NHANES. We used the survey
weights to estimate the number of noninstitutionalized, CVD-free
and nonpregnant US adults ages 20 to 79 years in each group.
Analyses were performed for all eligible adults and were stratified by
age, sex, and race subgroups. For some subgroup analyses, we split
the population into fewer categories to avoid presenting data from
cells with fewer than 30 subjects, as recommended by the NHANES
Analytic Guidelines.9 When results from fewer subjects are provided,
this is noted in the tables. Differences between groups in the distribution
of risk strata were assessed using the 2 test, and a 2-tailed probability
value 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

information to determine their short-term and lifetime risk
strata (Supplemental Figure 1). Exclusion on the basis of
missing variables was somewhat more likely for blacks (19.4%)
compared with whites (12.1%). The final study sample was
representative of 86.4% of the noninstitutionalized, nonpregnant,
CVD-free US population ages 20 to 79 years. Specific partici-
pant characteristics, weighted to reflect the US population, are
shown in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2.
Distribution of Risk Strata
Among the overwhelming majority (82.0%) of US adults
with low short-term predicted risk (Table 2), two thirds are at
high lifetime predicted risk, whereas only one third are at low
lifetime predicted risk (see Table 1). Of note, the proportion
of US adults with very low lifetime risk due to all optimal risk
factors is small, at 11.4%; the proportion is smaller in men
than in women and is dramatically smaller in older compared
with younger age groups (Table 2). The estimated size of the
US population in each risk stratum is shown in Figure 1.
Effect of Demographic Variables on Risk Strata
At the youngest ages, almost all men and women are at low
short-term predicted risk, and further stratification by lifetime
predicted risk produces 2 groups of substantial sizes in both
sexes (Table 2). For example, as shown in Figure 2, the
majority of men younger than 60 years and women younger
than 80 years old are at low 10-year predicted risk, and
among this large group the majority have low 10-year but
high lifetime predicted risk. However, at older ages the
proportion at high short-term predicted risk is markedly
higher in men than in women, such that in the oldest age
group (60 to 79 years) only 10.4% of men but 70.2% of
women are at low-short term predicted risk. Thus, at older
ages, lifetime risk stratification identifies a much larger group
of women (63.7% of women ages 60 to 79 years) with low
short-term/high lifetime risk compared with men (7.4% of
men ages 60 to 79 years) (Table 2 and Figure 2). Patterns of
predicted risks are similar among races; although Mexican-
Americans had lower predicted risk compared with other
racial groups (Table 2), this is probably the result of their
younger age distribution (Supplemental Table 1).
Effect of Including Low HDL Cholesterol and
Obesity as Major Risk Factors
When low HDL cholesterol and obesity are also counted as
major risk factors, the proportion with high lifetime predicted
risk is larger, though modestly so (Table 3). For example,
including both risk factors causes 10.3% of adults to move
from the low short-term/low lifetime predicted risk group to
the low short-term/high lifetime predicted risk group.
Distribution of Major Risk Factors
Table 4 gives the proportion and absolute numbers of US adults
affected with each of the elevated and major risk factors. The
wide distribution of isolated risk factors indicates that no single
risk factor is responsible for determining the lifetime risk
stratification. For example, despite its high prevalence (espe-
cially among younger adults), smoking as the sole risk factor
results in high lifetime predicted risk status in only 9.4% of
individuals who have low short-term predicted risk.
Effect of Altering Low Short-Term Risk Definitions
When low short-term risk is defined either as 6% predicted
10-year risk for hard CHD (and absence of diabetes) using the
ATP III risk assessment tool10 or as 20% predicted 10-year
risk for total CVD (and absence of diabetes) using the risk
functions published by D'Agostino et al,11 the distribution of
lifetime predicted risk among those at low short-term pre-
dicted risk does not change meaningfully (data not shown).

risk for a coronary event, but this majority comprises 2
groups: one third in the low short-term CHD/low lifetime
CVD predicted risk group and two thirds (ie, 87 million
individuals) in the low short-term CHD/high lifetime CVD
predicted risk group. Among those 40 to 59 years of age, a
group that may be of particular interest for clinical preven-
tion, 80% have low short-term predicted risk, but three
fourths of these have high lifetime predicted risk. Second, the
size of the low short-term/high lifetime predicted risk group
is substantial in women and younger men, precisely the
populations for which the ATP III risk assessment tool has
been shown to discriminate risk poorly.1,12­14
Current Study in Context
Prior studies have reported the distribution of lifetime CVD
risk strata in selected cohorts.4­6 Using the same lifetime risk
algorithm used in the present study, these prior studies
demonstrated that the low short-term risk group comprises 2
groups, which are defined by lifetime predicted risk and are
quite disparate with respect to subclinical disease burden and
progression6 as well as CVD event rates over the lifespan.4,5
Although these studies are valuable for their outcome mea-
surements, a strength of the present study is that the contem-
porary nationally representative sample provides more rele-
vant information about the current distribution of lifetime risk
strata in the United States.
Previous reports have provided the distribution of short-
term CHD risk strata in the US population, with about three
fourths of US adults consistently classified as "low risk" by
ATP III guidelines.1­3 However, there has been no prior
report of the distribution of lifetime CVD risk strata in the US
population, and the present study demonstrates the striking
departure of this distribution from that of 10-year CHD risk.
Whereas 82% of CVD-free US adults are at "low risk" based
on 10-year CHD predicted risk alone, the group at "low/low
risk" based on stepwise stratification by lifetime CVD pre-
dicted risk is much smaller, at 26%.
Significance of Demographic Variables and Risk
Factor Definitions
Although the Framingham Risk Score for 10-year predicted
risk of CHD represents an important advance in primary
prevention that has allowed clinicians to match intensity of
therapy to absolute risk, it has well-recognized limitations,
particularly in women and younger men.1,12­14 The stepwise
stratification system used in the present analysis identifies a
low short-term/high lifetime predicted risk group that is
highly prevalent in the US population, particularly in women
and younger men. This is because the lifetime risk algorithm
comprising the "second step" in our stratification is not
dependent on sex or age and stratifies observed lifetime risk
similarly for both sexes and all adult age groups studied to
date,5 whereas the Framingham Risk Score (and the related
ATP III tool) is overwhelmingly dependent on the weighting
of the sex and age variables. In fact, we showed in the present
analysis that the lifetime risk algorithm is not driven by any
single risk factor and that it identifies a substantial low
short-term/high lifetime risk group even when stringent
definitions of low short-term risk are applied.
Clinical and Public Health Implications
We therefore believe that our results provide support for
adoption of this stratification system by healthcare profes-
sionals to aid risk communication for a large segment of the
US population. Assigning a lifetime predicted risk status to
US adults presenting for primary prevention would change
the message to those 87 million individuals with low short-
term but high lifetime predicted risk. As an example of what
these individuals may be counseled to expect in terms of
absolute risk, 50-year-old participants in the Framingham
Heart Study with "high predicted lifetime risk" had absolute
lifetime risks for CVD of 45.5% to 68.9% for men and 39.1%
to 50.2% for women.4 For a specific illustration of the
motivational utility of the lifetime risk estimate, consider a
50-year-old nonsmoking, nondiabetic woman with total cho-
lesterol of 240 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol of 58 mg/dL, and
untreated systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg. Her 10-year
hard CHD risk is 2% according to ATP III, but her lifetime
CVD risk is a more motivating 50%.4 Additionally, individ-
uals with low short-term/high lifetime predicted risk could be
informed that at present, even at young ages, they probably
have significantly greater subclinical disease burden com-
pared with those with low short-term/low lifetime predicted
risk due to a more favorable risk factor profile.6 Such facts may
be useful for motivating lifestyle changes or adherence to

pharmacological therapy in the 56% of the population with low
short-term predicted risk but significant risk factor burden.
As noted above and strikingly apparent in Figure 2, this may
be particularly true for women and younger men. The more
inclusive focus on total atherosclerotic CVD as the end point for
lifetime risk makes the estimate more relevant for women,
whose majority of first events are stroke rather than CHD15 and
who have considerable morbidity and mortality from other
non-CHD outcomes such as heart failure.8,16,17 Furthermore, the
extended time frame of lifetime risk avoids false reassurance for
women and younger men with unhealthy lifestyle habits who are
nonetheless "low risk" for a coronary event in the short term.
Given that more women than men die of CVD each year in the
United States17 and that younger adults are beginning to see a
reversal in declines in CHD mortality18 (probably caused by
increases in obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syn-
drome in this age group), relevant and motivating risk messages
are urgently needed for these segments of the population. The
addition of a second step to risk assessment with lifetime risk
estimates shows promise in this regard.
We believe that our results may also prove useful on a
public health level. Our data might assist in the estimation of
costs associated with any new guidelines regarding long-term
risk, and they also provide a current baseline for population
burden of lifetime predicted risk against which the effects of
future public health and clinical interventions may be mea-
sured. In particular, we report that only 11.4% of American
adults are at optimal predicted risk. This is important because
intensive pharmacological and behavioral therapy to normal-
ize risk factors in the 87 million individuals with low
short-term/high lifetime predicted risk is unlikely to be
feasible economically. Avoidance of the onset of risk factors
in the first place--or primordial prevention19,20--has been
shown to be not only a more sustainable but also a more
effective means of reducing CVD mortality than either
treating these risk factors (as in primary prevention) or
treating clinical CVD (as in secondary prevention).21­23 In
fact, multiple studies24­28 have defined and examined an
optimal risk group and demonstrated that these individuals
not only live substantially longer than those with 1 or more
elevated risk factors, but they rarely have CVD despite this
longer life span and additionally end up with fewer comor-
bidities, better health-related quality of life, and decreased
healthcare costs in older age. Clearly, increasing the propor-
tion of Americans with both low 10-year and low lifetime
predicted risk would have dramatically beneficial effects on
public health. Thus, programs that focus on primordial
prevention, in combination with clinical practice that stresses
the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle and monitors rates of
adverse change in risk factor levels even before they become
"treatable," are likely to have the best long-term success in
reducing the burden of CVD in the United States.
Potential Limitations
Because fasting glucose levels were not available for the
majority of participants, we relied on self-report to identify
diabetes; therefore, a small proportion of individuals with
undiagnosed diabetes may have been misclassified as lower
risk. Additionally, the applicability of our risk stratification
algorithms to all races is not ensured; both the 10-year10 and
lifetime4 risk stratification algorithms were developed in the
exclusively white Framingham cohorts. However, the 10-year
risk functions for hard CHD have since been shown to be
transportable to other races,10,29 and the lifetime risk stratifi-
cation algorithm has been validated in the multi-ethnic (black
and white) US cohorts of the Chicago Heart Association
Detection Project in Industry30 and the Cardiovascular Life-
time Risk Pooling Project5 as well in CARDIA and MESA,
with data on subclinical disease.6 Finally, our short-term and
lifetime predicted risks were for different end points; whereas
the short-term outcome for our main analysis is hard CHD, as
recommended by current guidelines,7 the lifetime outcome is
total atherosclerotic CVD. However, we did compare short-
term CVD with lifetime CVD predicted risk in a secondary

analysis, and although ATP III focuses on hard CHD as the
outcome of interest, the more inclusive outcome of total CVD
may be more clinically relevant. We believe that despite the
potential limitations, our delineation of short-term and life-
time risk strata among US adults represents valuable infor-
mation for policy makers and clinicians looking to confront
the substantial burden of CVD in the United States.

Supplemental Figure 1. Selection of study sample. CVD=cardiovascular disease, HDL=high-density lipoprotein.
Target sample:
Interview and exam participants aged 20 to 79
years, nonpregnant, and free of CVD (n=7,396)
Did not meet inclusion criteria (n=13,074)
Did not complete interview and exam (n=877)
Currently pregnant (n=647)
Age <20 or >79 years (n=10,782)
Answered "yes" to whether a doctor or health
professional ever said they had coronary heart
disease, a heart attack, a stroke, or
congestive heart failure (n=768)
All NHANES 2003-2004 and 2005-2006
participants (n=20,470)
Final study sample:
Participants with necessary data available to
estimate risk (n=6,329)
Excluded due to missing variables (n=1,067)
Blood pressure (n=698)
