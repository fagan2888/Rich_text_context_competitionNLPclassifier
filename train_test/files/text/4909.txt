Introduction
Nigeria is one of the countries in Africa endowed with
immense human and material resources. She is called the
"giant" of Africa. Her crude oil production stood at 2,059
million pound sterling by September 2010 (Okoli, 2010).
Nigeria has been involved in many economic, political, and
social restructurings, yet, ranked very low in the Corruption
Perception Index (CPI) in 2010. She scored 2.4 on October
28, 2010, against 3.5 in 2009. Similarly, she dropped from
130th position in 2009 to 134th in 2010.
This performance is certainly not limited to Nigeria. Some
other African countries have similar low ranking. According
to the CPI ranking in 2010, many African countries scored
below 3.5. For instance, Gambia scored 3.2 and took 91st
position; Burkina Faso 3.1, 98th position; Egypt 3.1; Zambia
3.0; Senegal 2.9; Gabon 2.9; Nigeria 2.4; Mauritania 2.3;
Cameroon 2.2; Cote d'ivoire 2.2; Republic of Congo 2.1;
and so on. These low levels of the perception of corruption
consequently affect public accountability and tend to impact
negatively on academic, social, and cultural rights including
the foundation of governance. Obasanjo (2003) and Osagiede
(2007) noted that in all levels of governance in African coun-
tries, corruption was seemingly institutionalized as the foun-
dation of governance. In the execution of duties, political and
administrative officials have not adhered to the existing rules
and regulations, and this has led to the loss of available
resources by the bureaucrats in their various work places. As
a result, this has greatly undermined accountability and per-
formance in government. Olu (2002) noted that the legiti-
macy and stability of governance became compromised as
citizens began to devise extra legal and informal ways to sur-
vive. The corruption quagmire in most African countries was
rooted in the failure and virtual collapse of governance, dis-
regard for procedures and accountability, and the continued
presence of bad leadership (Obasanjo, 2003).
However, the African Union (AU) concerned about the
negative effects of corruption and impunity on the political,
economic, social, and cultural stability of African states con-
sidered ways and means of removing such obstacles to the
enjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights (African
Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption,
2003). Consequently, Article 2(5) of the AU clearly states
that African states should establish the necessary conditions

Instrumentalities for the Effectiveness
of Measures of Public Accountability in
Africa: The Nigeria Perspective
Agu Sylvia U1
Abstract
The effectiveness of the various measures put in place by government for the promotion of public accountability in Africa
using Nigeria as a case study was examined using a 12-item questionnaire. The aim was to find the importance of these
measures in the promotion of public accountability in Nigeria. A total of 240 respondents, comprising 140 males (65.6%) and
100 females (34.4%), answered the questionnaire. The mean age of the respondents was 24.89 years. The result disclosed
that these measures were partially implemented in the discharge of duties and this led to the achievement of very limited
successes. The chi-square was also used to test the relationship between implementation of these measures and effectiveness
of public accountability. The result revealed a significant relationship. Suggestions were therefore made on how to improve
the use of these measures which included recognition of the importance of these measures, adequate monitoring, removal
of the immunity clause, strict adherence to sanctions irrespective of whoever is involved, and compulsory accountability by
leaders.

to foster transparency and accountability in the management
of public affairs. Member states were encouraged to fashion
modalities or measures, among other initiatives, for the pro-
motion of public accountability and effective eradication of
corruption. This stimulated various African Heads of State to
come up with an improved and more transparent process of
government spending which is based on accountability and
transparency (Obiajulu, 2005). Obasanjo, past president of
Nigeria, instituted the Budget Monitoring and Price
Intelligence Unit (BMPIU) which commenced a process of
contract award review oversight and certification, theAfrican
Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), and the anti-corruption
agencies--Economic and Financial Crime Commission
(EFCC) and Independent Commission and other Related
Practices (ICPC)--to fight corruption and restore account-
ability because of the belief that lack of accountability pro-
motes corruption.
Public accountability refers to answerability to one's
action or behavior (Adamolekun, 2002; Obi, 1996).
Formally, public accountability involves the development of
objective; standards of evaluation to assist the owners of an
organization to evaluate the performance of individual
duties within the organization (Adamolekun, 2002). Public
accountability also involves subordinate­superior relation-
ships, strict compliance with legal requirements, and organi-
zational policies (Obi, 1996). Public accountability has
three crucial components: a clear definition of responsibil-
ity, reporting mechanisms, and a system of review, reward,
and sanctions. A growing literatures (for example, Amoke &
Asogwa, 2000; Ogban, 2000) sees public accountability as
indispensable for good governance; the greater the quality
of public accountability, the greater the quality of good gov-
ernance. The purpose of this article is, therefore, to examine
the effectiveness of measures of public accountability in
Nigeria and to find out if these measures were observed in
the discharge of duties and the subsequent effect on public
accountability.
There are different manifestations of accountability--
public and private--but this work is interested in public
accountability, which again manifests itself in many forms
such as political, administrative, and fiscal accountability
(Amoke & Asogwa, 2000; Bayene & Otobo, 1994). The
focus of this article is on administrative accountability, the
extent to which administrators internalize and implement
the measures of public accountability in the day-to-day
operations. Administrative accountability revolves on vir-
tually every worker in an organization especially those at
the upper echelon. Political accountability assumes that
occupants of political offices would meet the expectations
of the electorate by fulfilling the promises made in the
manifestoes of their parties. Fiscal accountability, on the
other hand, is directed toward ensuring that funds are uti-
lized by governments in accordance with established regu-
lations and guidelines for purposes for which they are
intended.
The aim of these basic groups of accountability is to
ensure that organizations achieve their established objec-
tives. Below is a sketch of types of public accountability.
It is the duty of government officials/functionaries who
are entrusted with the rules and regulations that guide the
operations of accountability measures to implement these
rules and regulations in their day-to-day operations and also
account to the people they serve, who conversely depend on
them. The efficient operation of these rules and regulations
will, to a great extent, improve the performance of public
enterprises and thus enhance accountability. This article
therefore is significant because before the introduction of
these measures, the use of primordial consideration and
"God Fatherism" (a form of corruption) abounded in almost
all public organizations in Nigeria. Unfortunately, there were
inadequate investigations of the effectiveness of the imple-
mented measures on public accountability. On the other
hand, the findings of this article can assist public servants to
revamp/improve their attitude to the discharge of their duties
to implement these measures of public accountability.
Furthermore, other African countries will benefit from the
study as it will help them unravel the implications of previ-
ous failure to comply with public accountability guidelines,
and reveal the effectiveness of these measures of public
accountability.
The Issue of Corruption Seen From the African
Perspective
Corruption is defined as the abuse of public power for private
or personal gains and is of growing international and regional
concern (Enweremadu & Okafor, 2009; Vian etal., 2012). The
dictionary definition of corruption is the impairment of integ-
rity, virtue, or moral principle; depravity, decay, and an induce-
ment to wrong by improper or unlawful means. Corruption is
a universal and historic issue, which occurs in both developed
and developing countries, and public and private sectors.
Corruption from petty bribery, nepotism, to large-scale lar-
ceny can have a devastating impact--undermining develop-
ment, destroying public trust, and burdening many sectors of
society, in particular the poor (Onor, 2002). The effect of cor-
ruption is destructive and its reach is insidious, yet many
African countries have deemed it unwise to discontinue their
corrupt tendencies. While many anti-corruption measures

have been instituted over the years in many African countries,
they have achieved little or no fruitful results (Soma, 2004).
Transparency International (TI) releases annually their CPI
which measures the perceived level of public sector corruption
in a country. Below is the CPI of African Countries from 2002
to 2010.
The ranking in Table 1 shows how countries compare to
others. The CPI score indicates the perceived level of public
sector corruption in a country. The CPI has been widely criti-
cized ever since it was introduced. The third-party survey data
that the index uses has also been criticized but, considering the
level of perceived corruption in many countries, the index still
serves as a reliable document (Transparency International
Corruption Perception/Index, 1999-2007). I adopted the index
in the ranking of countries as it pertains to corruption in the
Worldwide Corruption Perception Index (2010). Countries
like Denmark, New Zealand, Singapore, Finland, Netherlands,
Sweden, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Norway, Iceland,
Luxembourg, Austria, Germany, Japan, Qatar, United
Kingdom, China, Belgium, and United States scored between
7 and 9.3 points in the 2010 ranking, with Denmark topping
the list. Analysis of the figures reveals that these assessments

were realistic. African countries scored well below 5 points
despite various official resolutions made over the years, such
as for example in the 34th Ordinary Session of the Heads of
States and Governments of Africa in 1998 in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, to fight against corruption.
If the authorities and institutions were accountable, effec-
tive, efficient, transparent, responsive, and equitable in the
discharge of their duties, then the issue of good governance
and capacity-building, which we believe are desired by all
Africans, would be achieved. African governments have
affirmed their commitment to advancing good governance in
the Victoria Falls Declaration of 1999 and reaffirmed the
vision of Kigali Declaration of 2005.
Improving governance implies the strengthening of the
measures of public accountability, implementing develop-
ment initiatives, and delivering basic services among a vari-
ety of local participating institutions including local
governments and others. Corruption notably results in
absence of transparency and accountability. From the avail-
able records of TI in Table 1, African countries have not
fared well.
Equally significant is the fact that some countries across
east, south, central, and north Africa had a CPI score lower
than 3.0 in the 2010 ranking. On the other hand, CPI com-
parative data also show improvement in the ranking of some
countries in Table 1; the main changes were as follows:
1. Ghana's score rose from 3.9 in 2009 to 4.1 in 2010.
2. Rwanda's score rose from 3.3 in 2009 to 4.0 in 2010.
3. Tunisia's score rose from 4.2 in 2009 to 4.3 in 2010.
4. Lesotho's score increased from 3.3 in 2009 to 3.5 in
2010.
5. Malawi's score increased from 3.3 in 2009 to 3.4 in
2010.
6. Liberia's score rose from 3.3 in 2009 to 3.5 in 2010.
Other countries had CPI scores lower than 3.0 in the 2010 CPI.
These countries included Mozambique, Uganda, Nigeria,
Togo, Zimbabwe, Mauritania, Cameroon, Libya, Cote d'ivoire,
Namibia, Kenya, CentralAfrican Republic, Republic of Congo,
Guinea Bissau, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea,
Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Burundi, Chad, and Liberia.
Zambia remained at 3.0 since 2009. Agreements concluded at
Assembly of Heads of States and Governments of the AU held
in Lusaka, Zambia, in July 2001 and the first session of the
Assembly of theAU held in Durban, SouthAfrica, in July 2002
helped to establish the necessary conditions to foster transpar-
ency and accountability in the management of public affairs.
However, with this agreement, one would have expected
the variousAfrican countries to institute measures that would
promote accountability and transparency and ensure strict
implementation of these measures. However, a close analysis
of the literature does not reveal any significant change
despite the measures instituted to promote accountability and
curb corruption (see Table 1).
Measures Adopted By Some African
Countries to Promote Accountability
Almost all African countries have introduced measures to
promote accountability in their various public sector man-
agement domains. South Africa enacted the Public Finance
Management Act No. 1 of 1999 assented on 2nd March,
1999. The Act is to regulate financial management in the
national and provincial governments, to ensure that all reve-
nues, expenditures, assets, and liabilities of these govern-
ments are managed efficiently and effectively; to provide for
the responsibilities of persons entrusted with financial man-
agement in these governments; and to provide for matters
connected therewith.
The object of this Act is to secure transparency, account-
ability, and sound management of the revenues, expenditure,
assets, and liabilities of the institutions to which this Act
applies. Section 6(9) stipulates that the act promotes and
enforces transparency in the management of revenue, expen-
ditures, assets, and liabilities of departments, public entities,
and constitutional institutions, and performs other functions
assigned to the national treasury.
Similarly, Act 663 of the parliament of the Federal
Republic of Ghana, the Public Procurement Act 2003, estab-
lishes public procurement board, makes administrative and
institutional arrangements for procurement, stipulates ten-
dering procedures, and provides for purposes connected with
these. Part 1(2) of the act stipulates that the objective of the
board is to include harmonization of the process of public
procurement in the public service, to secure a judicious and
efficient use of state resources in public procurement, and to
ensure that public procurement is carried out in a fair, trans-
parent, and non-discriminatory manner. Part 3 stipulates the
functions of the board. One of the important functions of the
board is embedded in part 3(g) which is to publish a monthly
Public Procurement Bulletin which shall contain information
germane to public procurement, including proposed procure-
ment notices, notices of information to tender, and contract
award information. Other important sections that pertain to
enhancing accountability in the system are the "whistle
blower" Act 2006. Ghana was the first country to be peer
reviewed by AU in January 2006, and was praised by observ-
ers as a model for the APRM process across Africa and for
the steady progress it has made in becoming a strong democ-
racy over the previous decade. Ghana's success in the pro-
cess is attributed to the structure, composition, and autonomy
given to the Governing Council, the body steering the
reviewed exercise.
Furthermore, conflict resolution helped this process. The
Lome Peace Accord of 1998 and its subsequent corollaries of
Abuja I and II in 2000 finally ended the war in Sierra Leone
and ushered in peace in that country, made provisions for key
reforms in governance; the responsible use of minerals and
resources; proceeds and fiscal accountability. The reform
introduced in the public sector was aimed at strengthening
Agu 5
states institutions, public financial management, and mod-
ernization of the economy (Ibrahim, 2010; Staffen &
Heywood, 2009).
In addition, some African countries, notably Algeria,
Liberia, Mauritania, Rwanda, and Ghana, have adopted the
use of the International Public Sector Accounting Standard
(IPSAS) if only on cash basis. IPSAS is a set of Accounting
Standards issued by the IPSAS Board of the International
Federation of Accountants (IFAC) for use by public sector
entities around the world in the preparation of financial state-
ments. IPSAS is a major step in enthronement of accountabil-
ity standards. Conversely, in some African countries such as
Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria, and The Gambia, arrange-
ments are underway to commence a transition from a modified
cash basis of accounting to adoption of full accrual IPSAS. A
phased implementation approach is planned (see http://www.
icasrilanka.com). South Africa and Algeria have also com-
pleted the process of APRM and have been reviewed at the
July AU Summit. Kenya, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Uganda
have been judged APRM compliants, all in a bid to promote
accountability. However, despite all these measures, the
Nigeria Head of Service at the Africa forum on fighting cor-
ruption lamented the limited functioning of the established
mechanisms withinAfrican countries as well as the weakening
of governance by globalization. He asserted that African tradi-
tional values were critical to sustainable good governance
including anti-corruption and integrity promotion crusade.
Nigeria's Experience in the Promotion of Public
Accountability
It is apposite for us to throw some light on the standing of
Nigeria with regard to the implementation of these measures.
Before the birth of the Nigeria Fourth Republic, corruption
had been practically institutionalized as an instrument of
governance in Nigeria with attendant destructive conse-
quences (Osagiede, 2007).
Following the resolution adopted by the Assembly of
African Heads of States in June 1998, the government of
Olusegun Obasanjo instituted a number of anti-corruption and
integrity promotion initiatives. Some of the measures included
the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences
Commission in 2000 (ICPC) and the EFCC in December
2002. The government also came up with an improved and
more transparent process of government spending based on
accountability and transparency (Obiajulu, 2005). Historically,
it is in the award of contracts by various ministries in Nigeria
that the poor transparency image of the country is mostly
ascribed. The government of Obasanjo therefore set up the
BMPIU in 2002, which commenced a process of contract
award review oversight and Certification commonly called the
"Due Process." This unit was a clearing house for government
procurement of goods and services and was established to
minimize waste in government expenditure as a result of
corruption, lack of accountability, and transparency in Public
Sectors (National Economic Empowerment and Development
Strategy [NEEDS], 2005). This was instituted after analyzing
the different concerns and problems identified as they affect
the Federal Service, the public sectors, and governance in gen-
eral. These and several other measures, including the APRM
that seeks, inter alia, to promote anti-corruption and integrity
did not yield results because of their limited application
Theoretical Framework
The agency theory was first formulated in the academic eco-
nomic literature in the early 1970s (Jensen & Meckling,
1976; Ross, 1973; Shapiro, 2005) that diffused into the busi-
ness schools. In the agency relationship, one party acts on
behalf of another. Government is the principal that creates
the different anti-corruption agencies to ensure the effective
implementation of measures of public accountability. Those
selected to work in the agencies may have been employed
based on certain criteria. In the selection process, govern-
ment may have faced a classical agency problem of asym-
metricinformation.Thoseselected/employedmayexaggerate
their talents. Government may have found better persons but
did not know enough or may not have provided adequate
incentives to attract them. The theory assumes that the agents
may take advantage of the appointment for their own benefit
or that of the government. Government may want the highest
quality job to be done, whereas the agents may want to
exploit all the information asymmetries to ensure that they
maximize their own interests at the expense of the principal.
Agency theory dictates that the principal tries to bridge the
information asymmetries by installing information systems
and monitoring the agent.All the activities carried out will be
monitored. The government may also offer some incentives
in an effort to align organizational interest with that of the
agent. And as part of this incentive, the government compen-
sates the workers for an outcome-oriented contract. The
employees of these organizations can work better if there are
incentive and proper supervision.
Materials and Methods
Government functionaries (those employed by government
to work in these agencies) are entrusted with the responsibili-
ties to ensure the success of EFCC, ICPC, and BMPIU. The
establishment of these agencies was to placate growing,
domestic, and international measures. Section 6(9-8) of the
ICPC Act stipulates that ICPC will receive and investigate
complaints from members of the public on allegation of cor-
rupt practices, and in appropriate cases, prosecute the offend-
ers, and examine the practices, systems, and procedure of
public bodies. The EFCC Act however contained far more
draconian powers than those of the ICPC. It was enjoined to
take all necessary measures to prevent and eradicate eco-
nomic and financial crimes in Nigeria. Section 6 of the Act
6 SAGE Open
stipulates the identifying, monitoring, and freezing or confis-
cating of proceeds from criminal activities such as terrorism,
financial and economic crimes, and so on. The EFCC has
about 1,246 officials on the pay roll but the commission also
has 700 police who earn a stipend; BMPIU has about 1,800
staff and ICPC about 1,754, giving a total of 4,800 staff. On
these numbers, I used the quota sampling technique which is
a type of non-probability sample in which the researcher
selects people according to some fixed quota. The specific
characteristics on which I based my quota were by gender. I
chose 240 of the entire relevant population using the quota
sampling technique. This is because I insisted on including a
certain number of males and females. I therefore chose those
that are most accessible considering the gender bias (Obasi,
1999). Population sample comprised 140 men (65.6%) and
100 women (34.4%). Majority of the staff were males,
72.58% were married, and 27.42% were single. A total of
27% obtained the West African school certificate, 33%
obtained the Ordinary National Diploma, and 40% were first
degree and master's degree students. A total of 79.16% were
Christians whereas 20.84% were Moslems. The mean age
was 24.89. I also considered those who had been in the ser-
vice for more than 5 years. The researcher distributed 240
questionnaires.
Some of the questionnaires were open ended whereas oth-
ers were closed-ended. A total of 186 relevant responses
were received.
Independent Measure
To capture respondents'views on measures of public account-
ability in Africa using Nigeria as a case study, respondents
were asked to agree, strongly agree, strongly disagree, or dis-
agree (Questions 8, 10, 11, 12) and to answer yes, no, or no
idea (Questions 1, 5, and 6) and fully implemented, partially
implemented, and implemented to Questions 3 and 4.
Questions asked by the researcher were as follows:
1. Are you aware of the several measures put in place
by the government of Obasanjo to enthrone account-
ability and combat corruption?
2. What are these measures?
3. Do you think that these measures are implemented in
the discharge of duties in the Nigerian public
services?
4. If yes, to what extent has the Nigeria public service
implemented these measures in the discharge of
duties?
5. Are some of these measures better implemented than
others?
6. Are hindrances encountered in the implementation of
these measures?
7. If yes, what are these hindrances?
8. Are these measures applicable to all the parastatals in
the Nigeria public service?.
9. Lack of implementation of these measures attracts
sanctions irrespective of whoever is involved.
10. Implementation of these measures has contributed to
the effectiveness of public accountability in the
Nigeria public service.
11. The emplacements of these measures have actually
curbed corruption
12. What is the position of Nigeria in the Transparency
International Index before and after the emplace-
ments of these measures?
Table 2 shows that 122 males and 64 females filled the ques-
tionnaires and returned them while the age distribution of
respondents reveals that 140 were between the ages of 20
and 30, 22 between 31 and 40, and 24 were aged 41 and
above (see Table 3). The questions were answered by these
age groups.
Findings pertaining to the first research question (see
Table 4, Item 1) revealed that all the workers knew about the
several measures put in place in the Nigeria public service to
promote accountability (100%). When asked what these
measures were, respondents ticked ICPC, EFCC, BMPIU,
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), moneti-
zation of public officers, fringe benefits, Servicom Charters
and creating Servicom, Modal Units in Ministries/
Departments/Agencies (MDAs). The EITI, according to

respondents, was aimed at encouraging the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and other oil and gas com-
panies to fully disclose revenues and cost of operations.
MDAs were designed to break the twin evils of corruption
and inefficiency in public service delivery, improve budget
discipline through efforts to establish annual budget frame-
work, and provide guidelines to be followed by all the three
tiers of government.
Results showed that about 30.4% believed that these mea-
sures were fully implemented, 51.06% believed they were
partially implemented, and 18% believed that these measures
were not implemented at all (see Table 5, Item 3). Although
51.06% was not an overwhelming majority, it was more than
half the number who answered the questionnaire. It then fol-
lows that these measures were not fully implemented in the
discharge of duties in the Nigeria public service. This also
shows that the activities of the agencies were not properly
supervised according to agency theory to achieve results.
The question on the extent to which these measures were
implemented recorded very poor results (see Table 5, Item
4). The agency theory states that agents may take advantage
of appointment for their own benefit or that of the govern-
ment, and this may account for the poor results obtained. If
government had played its role of bridging the information
asymmetries and monitored workers, a better result would
have been achieved. We should note that partial fulfillment
of any measure does not attract full reward.
This could explain the reason for the insignificant change in
the CPI ranking. For Research Questions 4, 5, and 6, respon-
dents indicated that these measures were not fully imple-
mented. The extent to which these measures were implemented
recorded very poor results. The majority of the respondents
opined that corruption was structurally engraved in the system
of public administration and this could be one of the main rea-
sons for non-implementation of these measures. Many
advanced phrases like "If you are in the good book of govern-
ment, you can turn the rules upside down and go scot free,"
"Does anything good work in Nigeria," and so on. However, a
good number, about 80.11%, responded that some of these
measures were better implemented than others (see Table 4,
Item 5). Some mentioned that the BMPIU is working better
than some anti-corruption commissions and has saved the
country millions of naira. The BMPIU recorded significant
results because of the intense monitoring by government and
due to the fact that the agency was headed by an honest person.
We also discovered that government negative intervention was
minimal in the award of contracts which led to effective imple-
mentation of due process mechanism. According to the theory,
government created these agencies to ensure effective imple-
mentation of these measures. Other respondents were of the
opinion that the Budget Discipline was not working properly as
it was usually violated by those in authority especially at local
government levels. Monetization of employee fringe benefits
worked only in the federal parastatals and that does not mean
that workers had not devised means of defrauding parastatals.
The majority of the respondents mentioned that EFCC and
ICPC were effective only with regard to victims who were not
in the good books of government. Respondents criticized the
activities of the new chairperson of EFCC and said that he
brought to book some culprits, but not all. The article went fur-
ther to find out if hindrances were encountered in the imple-
mentation of these measures. An impressive result was
obtained; those who answered strongly agreed and agreed
comprised 82.5%, and they believed that hindrances were
encountered in the implementation of these measures (see
Table 4). When asked about some of these hindrances encoun-
tered, members stated categorically that rules were violated to
protect the interest of government, the workers, and those in
authority. "You don't crucify your employers" do you? was one
response.
It does appear that the rules set by government were also
violated by the same body. Most of the respondents opined
that God Fatherism clogged to the implementation of mea-
sures. Respondents advanced typical comments of officials
such as "If you don't obey what I say, you'll be fired"; "This
is my relative; if you value your job; just do what I said."
Furthermore, 37.63% "agreed," whereas 44.9% "strongly
agreed" that these measures were applicable to all public
enterprises in public service, except the monetization of
fringe benefits which they purported as applicable only to
federal government workers (see Table 6, Item 8).
However, 43.01% and 38.48% "strongly disagreed" and
"disagreed" respectively that lack of implementation of these
measures attracts sanctions irrespective of whoever is
involved. Respondents believed that the law in that case is a
"respecter of persons." They said that the position one holds
matters a lot. They cited the case of one-time speaker of the
House of Representatives and some state governors who
were protected by the immunity clause. According to them,
these persons deserved to be fired but were not. When asked
about the former Minister of Education, they said that the
sledge hammer fell on him because he was not in the good

book of the government. However, a good number of the
respondents believed that implementation of these mecha-
nisms in some areas had contributed to the effectiveness of
public accountability (see Table 6, Item 10). Finally, a chi-
square was performed to find out the relationship between
the implementation of these measures emplaced and public
accountability. The result revealed that there is a significant
relationship between the implementation of these measures
and public accountability. The level of significance is .05.
The degree of freedom of = (R - 1) (C - 1) = (5 - 1) (2 - 1)
= 4 From the X2, significant level of .05, the critical value is
9.48.
Decision Rule: Reject critical value if greater than statisti-
cal value at level of significance .05 and accountability in the
Nigeria public service. A typical example was the case of
one-time speaker of the House of Representatives, Federal
Republic of Nigeria. She assigned N628 million for the reno-
vation of her official residence and official car. When con-
fronted by the House, she claimed that she had followed due
process rules and regulations. She went further to make use
of ghost companies to execute the projects. A Newswatch
(Daminabo, 2007) investigation revealed that the procedure
for the award of the contract was substantially at variance
with the prescribed process. The summary of the case was
that she did not follow the due process mechanism installed
in the system and the budget discipline was not followed.
Her crime was detected, but she was merely demoted instead
of being recalled by her constituency. Another example was
the Abuja National Stadium contract awarded in 2000 before
the enactment of the Due Process Guideline which requires
that any project with federal government funding must be
backed by a Due Process Certificate. Therefore, in this case,
the BMPIU had to do a retroactive compliance review on the
procurement process. This was to ascertain the true cost of
the project. The process for awarding the contract would not
have passed the due process test had the policy been in place
when the contract was awarded. However, the best outcome
that government could secure was to compare the contract
cost to international, regional, or national pricing. It is worth
noting that contrary to the wrong costing quoted before the
stadium, the BMPIU achieved a post procurement cost sav-
ing of N7.9 billion (Ezekwesili, 2004).
Again, in December 2005, the BMPIU had saved Nigeria
about N960 billion from a single contract within 4 years of
its implementation (Ezekwesili, 2006). These efforts by the
agencies are reflected in the scores of TI. However, despite
the establishment of these institutions to enhance the effec-
tiveness of public accountability, the level of corruption is
still serious and remains one of the greatest challenges in
Nigeria. The former chairman of Due Process, Dr. Oby
Ezekwesili, stated that the Due Process saved Nigeria
N672.4 million from a single project of supplying equip-
ment to tertiary institutions by the Ministry of Health.
According to Wahab (2005), the success of this aspect of the
reform, no doubt, contributed to the realization of debt relief
granted to Nigeria in 2005. It is also important to note that
Due Process is the best development mechanism that coun-
tries like South Korea, Malaysia, South Africa, Singapore,
Ghana, Botswana, Uganda, United Kingdom, and United
States of Africa have utilized effectively in instituting and
achieving high relief in public expenditure, efficiency, and
value for money in the delivery of social goods, works,
and services to communities.
The researcher also performed a chi-square test to see if
partial implementation of these measures will promote
accountability. The level of significance is .05, df = (R - 1)
(C - 1) = (5 - 1) (2 - 1) = 4. The level of significance is .05,
the critical value is 9.48. As critical value 9.48 is less than
statistical value which is 10.98, I therefore concluded that
partial implementation of these measures will not promote
accountability and transparency. The report of the ICPC and
EFCC on several cases investigated as well as those success-
fully prosecuted indicated that poor accountability had led to
loss of revenues. One of Nigeria's former heads of state and
commander in chief was discovered to have stolen more than
$3.0 billion, which was found in foreign accounts. A one-
time inspector general of police was found guilty of siphon-
ing off N17.0 billion by the EFCC. However, some state
governors accused of looting state treasuries were still under
prosecution. In June 2007, EFCC and ICPC recovered N613
billion from 225 convictions (this day; March 11, 2008). This
amount, according to Ogunlaya, represented 4% of federal
and state budgetary provisions for the period 2002-2006. In
addition, the Punch Newspaper on May 26, 2010, reported
that three top officials of Oyo State Government as well as a
consultant were detained by the EFCC over alleged involve-
ment in N8.3 billion road contract scam. A concerned indi-
vidual in that state wrote a petition and this was what actually

led to the arrest of the culprits. If these measures installed in
the system were fully implemented, these crimes would have
been averted. Though they were later discovered, prevention
is better than cure. Conversely, it is estimated that up to 40%
of government budgets at various levels were lost to corrupt
government officials. Those who made the law were the ones
who violated it. Similarly, Nigeria would have performed
better if the activities of those in the corridors of power had
been transparent. If government officials had been fully
accountable and open, the remaining 60% would have pro-
duced quality projects or services. Unfortunately, this is
highly compromised as a result of corrupt practices of gov-
ernment (Agu, 2008). According to TI, Nigeria improved on
the world's most corrupt countries profile from third position
in 2005 to 32 in 2007. The improvement was however attrib-
uted to the zeal with which the anti-corruption agencies per-
formed in prosecuting corrupt officials which served as a
deterrent. Timely intervention of these anti-corruption bod-
ies is of immense value. For instance, South Africa has the
Public Finance Management Act which contains measures to
promote accountability and transparency. From all indica-
tions, the country has to some extent adopt the provisions of
this act as it was among the African countries that scored
above 4.00 from 2002 to 2010. For example, the South
African government cancelled 152.7 million contract follow-
ing serious allegations of tender irregularities.
The ICPC, which focuses on curbing bribery and corrup-
tion in the Nigeria public service, stipulates in the ICPC Act
punishments to be meted out to offenders, but these provi-
sions were not implemented when those in the good books of
government were involved.
Conclusion and Recommendations
This article assessed the various anti-corruption measures
installed in some African countries for the effectiveness of
public accountability. We discovered that the key functionar-
ies in the Nigerian public sector do not adhere strictly to
these measures in the discharge of their duties. Their lack of
commitment manifested as nepotism, favoritism, and gender
bias. Furthermore, those in the corridors of power also con-
tributed significantly to poor implementation of these mea-
sures as rules were violated for their sake. The Nigeria State
should consider very seriously the implementation of the
measures instituted and ensure that all offenders receive pun-
ishment as stipulated. This would in no small measure pro-
mote accountability. It would also save wastage of resources:
The efforts, however small, made by the various chairper-
sons of these bodies (BMPIU, ICPC, and EFCC) saved so
much money for the country. Agency theory advocates strict
supervision to ensure compliance, but this was relegated to
the background. This lack of effective supervision led to
undermining of public accountability and promotion of cor-
ruption. The relationship between an increasing rate of poor
accountability, transparency, and corruption seems to enjoy
strong support. Conversely, there appears to be lack of cohe-
sion demonstrated by the absence of full implementation of
these measures in the Nigeria public sectors. According to
Oronsaye (2007), corruption thrives in the face of the break-
down of moral and ethical values in the society. All the sec-
tors of the economy and society are bedeviled by the cancer
of corruption in almost equal measure as none is an island of
itself. Evidence also showed that these cluster of anti-corrup-
tion measures recorded very limited success because of the
poor wage and incentive structures that should normally sup-
port productivity in the public sectors.
Agency theory advocates for increased salaries to moti-
vate workers to give their best, and on this basis government
should increase salaries and incentives of workers to achieve
a better result. In addition, the "immunity syndrome"
bestowed on those in government also contributed to merely
a partial implementation of these measures. Arising from the
foregoing, I advance the following recommendations. The
Nigeria public sector should devise a better method of how
to implement measures for the effectiveness of public
accountability and transparency. These measures recorded
very limited success because they were not properly imple-
mented. The empirical evidence reflected the lack of com-
mitment on the part of government officials who failed fully
to apply laws and regulations of these rules through their
refinement, using best-practice-tested approaches (Oronsaye,
2007).
With regard to recognition of the importance of these
measures for the good of the country, there is a need to rec-
ognize the importance and role these measures would play if
implemented. For instance, Due Process or the Public
Procurement Tender is the best development-boosting mech-
anism utilized by countries such as South Korea, Malaysia,
South Africa, Singapore, Ghana, Uganda, and even the
United Kingdom and the United States to effectively institute
and achieve a high rate of public expenditure, efficiency, and
value for money in the delivery of social goods, works, and
services.
This has practical implication; it suggests that if these
mechanisms were adhered to, it would lead to promotion of
accountability and transparency, and curb corruption drasti-
cally. It would also encourage investors. We therefore appeal
for strong recognition and implementation of the importance
of these measures.
There is need for a change of mindset about the imple-
mentation of these measures by those in authority and the
functionaries in the different ministries. Strict adherence to
these measures would improve service delivery, efficiency,
competition, and effectiveness, and curtail corruption. This
would also facilitate Nigeria to be enlisted among the devel-
oped nations of the world. Those in the corridors of power
should be the first to implement these measures. Obama was
the first to publicly declare his tax return in 2010 in America
to show the citizens the importance of paying tax. In Nigeria,
"big men" do not pay taxes but public servants do.According
10 SAGE Open
to Oguonu (2004), there is need for institutionalizing, inter-
nalizing, and building ownership for the multitude of reforms
within the public sectors so as to ensure its sustenance in the
anti-corruption campaign. It is vital for our leaders to
enthrone the principle of openness, transparency, mobility,
and accountability in their day-to-day operations.
Moreover, a system of internal checks has to be built into
the system to ensure that measures are fully enforced. This
is a very important step toward achieving the set goals.
Qualified, honest, and sincere personnel with good records
are perhaps the best internal check. However, on February
17, 2011, the Zero Corruption Coalition and the many
Nigerian citizens wrote to the President concerning the
appointment of Justice Pius Aderemi, a retired justice, as the
next chairman of the ICPC. The Coalition referred
the President to Section 3(4) of the ICPC 2000 Act and
Section 5(6) of the constitution. This section according to
them nullifies the appointment of the retired Judge. They
stated categorically that the appointment of the leadership of
anti-corruption agency in Nigeria should be driven by a
desire to effect fundamental and radical change in Nigeria,
not by parochial and self- service interest. His antecedents
does not qualify him for the position given to him . Again,
they lamented on the ineffectiveness of these commissions
particularly under the previous leadership of retired justice
of Supreme Court and police officers. With regard to ade-
quate monitoring of corruption, ad hoc task force commit-
tees need to be set up in all public enterprises to monitor the
implementation of the various instruments put in place to
fight corruption which undermined accountability. Proper
monitoring would lead to full implementation of these mea-
sures installed to promote accountability. Government
should show commitment and make these agencies autono-
mous to enable them to execute their duties effectively and
efficiently. There should be increase in salary of workers
and incentives to motivate them: According to Oronsaye
(2007), anti-corruption measures recorded very limited suc-
cess because of poor wages and incentive structures in the
Nigeria Civil Service. There is, therefore, a clear need to
articulate and harmonize new salary packages for workers
with a view to motivating them when the need arises. Poor
welfare and working conditions, which do not provide for
decent living, often encourage non-implementation of such
measures. A senator receives 260,000.00 merely as a yearly
constituency allowance, whereas a full-time state civil ser-
vant receives about 300,000.00 per annum and federal
workers 1,400,000.00. In November 2012, civil servants in
Nigeria went on strike because of non-implementation of a
18,000.00 minimum wage package for workers. The atten-
dant social insecurity affects the perception of public ser-
vants. More so, the attitude of both federal and state
governments toward the payment of retirement benefits and
pensions also influences workers' attitudes to the applica-
tion of these measures put in place to guide against fraudu-
lent activities.
The introduction of the new pension scheme in the Nigeria
Federal Service is a step in the right direction, but of equal
importance is the fact that state civil servants should be
included in this arrangement. Young school leavers consti-
tute 40% of the Nigerian population, and they are dependent
on their parents who are in the public service. How can their
needs be met with their parents' meager salaries? Again, the
immunity clause should be expunged. The withdrawal of this
clause would give the administration an opportunity to truly
express, in practical terms, a commitment to promote
accountability and transparency, and curb corruption.
