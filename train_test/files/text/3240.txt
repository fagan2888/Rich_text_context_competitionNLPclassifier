Non-technical summary
Research question
Temporal aggregation generally introduces a moving average (MA) component in the
model for the aggregate variable. A similar feature should be present in the mixed frequency
models, and indeed we show formally that this is in general the case. The effects of
neglecting the MA component have been rarely explicitly considered in a single frequency
context. For mixed frequency models, there are no results available.
Contribution
We close this gap and analyze the relevance of the inclusion of an MA component in
mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) and unrestricted mixed-data sampling (UMIDAS) mod-
els, with the resulting specifications labeled, respectively, MIDAS-ARMA and UMIDAS-
ARMA. We first compare the forecasting performance of the mixed frequency models with
and without the MA component in a set of Monte Carlo experiments, using a variety of
Data Generating Processes (DGPs). Next, we carry out an empirical investigation, where
we predict several quarterly macroeconomic variables using timely monthly indicators. In
particular, we forecast three relevant quarterly U.S. macroeconomic variables: real GDP
growth, real private non residential fixed investment (PNFI) growth and GDP deflator
inflation.
Results
In the Monte Carlo simulations, the short-term forecasting performance is better when
including the MA component, and the gains are higher the more persistent is the se-
ries. Moreover, in general the MIDAS-ARMA specifications are slightly better than the
UMIDAS-ARMA specifications. This pattern suggests that adding the MA component to
the MIDAS model helps somewhat in reducing the potential misspecification due to impos-
ing a specific lag polynomial structure. In the empirical exercise, the inclusion of an MA
component generally improves the forecasting performance substantially. For all variables,
and in line with the simulation results, MIDAS-ARMA is better than UMIDAS-ARMA.

Fragestellung
Durch zeitliche Aggregation einer hochfrequenten Variablen entsteht eine Variable mit niedri-
gerer Frequenz. In Folge der Aggregation tritt in der Dynamik der niederfrequenten Variablen
dann üblicherweise eine Komponente auf, die einem (gewichteten) gleitenden Durchschnitt
(GD) entspricht. Eine vergleichbare Komponente sollte auch in Modellen mit gemischten
Frequenzen, also in Modellen mit hoch- und niederfrequenten Daten vorhanden sein. Wie
sich die Nichtbeachtung der GD-Komponente auswirkt, ist in den üblichen Zeitreihenmodel-
len bislang kaum explizit betrachtet worden. Für gemischt-frequente Modelle, die sogenann-
ten MIDAS-Modelle, liegen indes überhaupt keine Ergebnisse vor.
Forschungsbeitrag
Wir untersuchen die Auswirkungen auf MIDAS- und unrestringierte MIDAS-Modelle (UM-
IDAS-Modellen), wenn eine GD-Komponente mit einbezogen wird. Die sich daraus ergeben-
den Spezifizikationen werden als ,,MIDAS-ARMA" bzw. ,,UMIDAS-ARMA" bezeichnet. Zu-
nächst wird die Prognosegüte der gemischt-frequenten Modelle mit und ohne GD-
Komponente in einer Monte-Carlo-Simulation unter Berücksichtigung verschiedener Daten-
generierungsprozesse verglichen. Anschließend werden in einer empirischen Untersuchung
drei makroökonomische US-amerikanische Quartalsvariablen ­ das reale BIP-Wachstum,
das Wachstum der realen privaten Anlageinvestitionen (ohne Wohnungsbau) und die Wachs-
tumsrate des BIP-Deflators ­ unter Verwendung zeitnaher monatlicher Indikatoren prognosti-
ziert.
Ergebnisse
In der Monte-Carlo-Simulation zeigt sich bei der Kurzfristprognose eine höhere Treffgenauig-
keit, wenn die GD-Komponente einbezogen wird. Die Prognosegüte verbessert sich umso
stärker, je höher die Persistenz der Zeitreihe ist. Zudem schneiden die MIDAS-ARMA-
Modelle allgemein etwas besser ab als die UMIDAS-ARMA-Modelle. Daraus lässt sich
schlussfolgern, dass die Einbeziehung der GD-Komponente dazu beiträgt, potenzielle Fehl-
spezifikationen in MIDAS-Modellen zu verringern. Auch in der empirischen Analyse verbes-
sert die Einbeziehung einer GD-Komponente die Prognosegüte oft deutlich, und MIDAS-

Abstract
Temporal aggregation in general introduces a moving average (MA) component
in the aggregated model. A similar feature emerges when not all but only a few vari-
ables are aggregated, which generates a mixed frequency model. The MA component
is generally neglected, likely to preserve the possibility of OLS estimation, but the
consequences have never been properly studied in the mixed frequency context. In
this paper, we show, analytically, in Monte Carlo simulations and in a forecasting
application on U.S. macroeconomic variables, the relevance of considering the MA
component in mixed-frequency MIDAS and Unrestricted-MIDAS models (MIDAS-
ARMA and UMIDAS-ARMA). Specifically, the simulation results indicate that the
short-term forecasting performance of MIDAS-ARMA and UMIDAS-ARMA is bet-
ter than that of, respectively, MIDAS and UMIDAS. The empirical applications on
nowcasting U.S. GDP growth, investment growth and GDP deflator inflation confirm
this ranking. Moreover, in both simulation and empirical results, MIDAS-ARMA is
better than UMIDAS-ARMA.

1 Introduction
The use of mixed-frequency models has become increasingly popular among academics
and practitioners. It is in fact by now well recognized that a good nowcast or short-term
forecast for a low frequency variable, such as GDP growth and its components, requires
to exploit the timely information contained in higher frequency macroeconomic or finan-
cial indicators, such as surveys or spreads. A growing literature has flourished proposing
different methods to deal with the mixed-frequency feature. In particular, models cast in
state-space form, such as vector autoregressions (VAR) and factor models, can deal with
mixed-frequency data, taking advantage of the Kalman filter to interpolate the missing ob-
servations of the series only available at low frequency (see, among many others, Mariano
and Murasawa (2010) and Giannone et al. (2008) in a classical context, and Chiu et al.
(2011) and Schorfheide and Song (2015) in a Bayesian context). A second approach has
been proposed by Ghysels (2016). He introduces a different class of mixed-frequency VAR
models, in which the vector of endogenous variables includes both high and low frequency
variables, with the former stacked according to the timing of the data releases. A third
approach is the mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regression, introduced by Ghysels et al.
(2006), and its unrestricted version (UMIDAS) by Foroni et al. (2015). MIDAS models are
tightly parameterized, parsimonious models, which allow for the inclusion of many lags of
the explanatory variables. Given their non-linear form, MIDAS models need to be esti-
mated by non-linear least squares (NLS). UMIDAS models are the unrestricted counterpart
of MIDAS models, which can be estimated by simple ordinary least squares (OLS), but
work well only when the frequency mismatch is small.1
In this paper, we start from the observation that temporal aggregation generally in-
troduces a moving average (MA) component in the model for the aggregate variable (see,
e.g., Marcellino (1999) and the references therein). A similar feature should be present in
the mixed frequency models, and indeed we show formally that this is in general the case.
The MA component is often neglected, both in same frequency and in mixed frequency
1The literature on mixed-frequency approaches is vast. The papers cited in the text are a non-exhaustive
list of key contributions to the field. For a review of the mixed-frequency literature, see Bai et al. (2013)
and Foroni and Marcellino (2013) among many others.

models, likely to preserve the possibility of OLS estimation and on the grounds that it can
be approximated by a sufficiently long autoregressive (AR) component.
The effects of neglecting the MA component have been rarely explicitly considered. In
a single frequency context, Lutkepohl (2006) showed that VARMA models are especially
appropriate in forecasting, since they can capture the dynamic relations between time se-
ries with a small number of parameters. Further, Dufour and Stevanovic (2013) showed
that a VARMA instead of VAR model for the factors provides better forecasts for several
key macroeconomic aggregates relative to standard factor models, as well as producing a
more precise representation of the effects and transmission of monetary policy. Leroux
et al. (2017) found that ARMA(1,1) models predict well the inflation change and outper-
form many data-rich models, confirming the evidence on forecasting inflation by Stock and
Watson (2007), Faust and Wright (2013) and Marcellino et al. (2006). Finally, VARMA
models are often the correct reduced form representation of DSGE models (see, for example,
Ravenna (2007)). For mixed frequency models, there are no results available.
We close this gap and analyze the relevance of the inclusion of an MA component
in MIDAS and UMIDAS models, with the resulting specifications labeled, respectively,
MIDAS-ARMA and UMIDAS-ARMA. We first compare the forecasting performance of
the mixed frequency models with and without the MA component in a set of Monte Carlo
experiments, using a variety of Data Generating Processes (DGPs). It turns out that
the short-term forecasting performance is better when including the MA component, and
the gains are higher the more persistent is the series. Moreover, in general the MIDAS-
ARMA specifications are slightly better than the UMIDAS-ARMA specifications, though
the differences are minor. This pattern is in contrast with the findings in Foroni et al. (2015),
and suggests that adding the MA component to the MIDAS model helps somewhat in
reducing the potential misspecification due to imposing a specific lag polynomial structure.
Next, we carry out an empirical investigation, where we predict several quarterly macroe-
conomic variables using timely monthly indicators. In particular, we forecast three relevant
quarterly U.S. macroeconomic variables: real GDP growth, real private non residential fixed
investment (PNFI) growth and GDP deflator inflation. The latter variable is particularly
relevant, as Stock and Watson (2007) show that the MA component for US inflation is
important, especially after 1984. In fact, while during the 1970s the inflation process could
be very well approximated by a low order AR, after the 1980s this has become less accurate
and the inclusion of an MA component more relevant. Evidence on the importance of the
2
MA component for the U.S. inflation is also found by Ng and Perron (2001) and Perron
and Ng (1996). As monthly explanatory variables, we consider industrial production and
employment for the real GDP growth and the PNFI growth, CPI inflation and personal
consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation for the GDP deflator. The inclusion of an MA
component generally improves the forecasting performance substantially. In particular,
adding the MA part to forecast GDP growth one-year ahead ameliorates the MSE up to
10%, while for PNFI we obtain even bigger gains, up to 30% one-year ahead. Also in the
case of GDP deflator we obtain robust improvements, which go up to 15%. For all variables,
and in line with the simulation results, MIDAS-ARMA is better that UMIDAS-ARMA.
Lastly, full sample estimates of MA coefficients are significant and important in most of
MIDAS-ARMA and UMIDAS-ARMA specifications.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we show that temporal
aggregation generally creates an MA component also in mixed frequency models. In Section
3 we describe parameter estimators for the MIDAS-ARMA and UMIDAS-ARMA models.
In Section 4 we present the design and results of the simulation exercises. In Section 5
we develop the empirical applications on forecasting U.S. quarterly variables with monthly
indicators. In Section 6 we summarize our main results and conclude.
2 The rationale for an MA component in mixed fre-
quency models
The UMIDAS regression approach can be derived by aggregation of a general dynamic
linear model in high frequency, as shown by Foroni et al. (2015), while the MIDAS model
imposes specific restrictions on the UMIDAS coefficients in order to reduce their number,
which is particularly relevant when the frequency mismatch is large (for example, with
daily and quarterly series). In Section 2.1, we briefly review the derivation of the UMIDAS
model, highlighting that, in general, there should be an MA component, even though it is
generally disregarded. In Section 2.2, we provide two simple analytical examples in which,
starting from a high-frequency model without MA term, we end up with a mixed frequency
model in which the MA component is present. We discuss estimation of mixed frequency
models with an MA component in a separate section.

2.1 UMIDAS regressions and dynamic linear models
Let us assume that the Data Generating Process (DGP) for the variable y and the N
variables x is an ARDL(p, q) process, as in Foroni et al. (2015):
a(L)ytm
= b1
(L)x1tm
+ ... + bN
(L)xNtm
+ eytm
(1)
where a(L) = 1 - a1
L - ... - ap
L, bj
(L) = bj1
L + ... + bjq
Lq, j = 1, ..., N, and the error eytm
is white noise. We assume, for simplicity, that p = q and the starting values y-p
, ..., y0
and
x-p
, ..., x0
are all fixed and equal to zero.
We then assume that x can be observed for each period tm
, while y can be only observed
every m periods. We define t = 1, ..., T as the low frequency (LF) time unit and tm
=
1, ..., Tm
as the high frequency (HF) time unit. The HF time unit is observed m times in
the LF time unit. As an example, if we are working with quarterly (LF) and monthly (HF)
data, it is m = 3 (i.e., three months in a quarter). Moreover, L indicates the lag operator
at tm
frequency, while Lm is the lag operator at t frequency.
We also introduce the aggregation operator
(L) = 0
+ 1
L + ... + m-1
Lm-1, (2)
which characterizes the temporal aggregation scheme. For example, (L) = 1 + L + ... +
Lm-1 indicates the sum of the high-frequency observations over the low-frequency period,
typically used in the case of flow variables, while (L) = 1 corresponds to point-in-time
sampling and is typically used for stock variables. As we will see, different aggregation
schemes will play a role in generating MA components.
To derive the generating mechanism for y at mixed frequency (MF), we introduce a
polynomial in the lag operator, (L), whose degree in L is at most equal to pm - p and
which is such that the product h(L) = (L)a(L) only contains powers of Lm, so that
h(L) = h(Lm). It can be shown that such a polynomial always exists, and its coefficients
depend on those of a(L), see Marcellino (1999) for details.
In order to determine the AR component of the MF process, we then multiply both
sides of (1) by (L) and (L) to get
h(Lm)(L)ytm
= (L)b1
(L)(L)x1tm
+ ... + (L)bN
(L)(L)xNtm
+ (L)(L)eytm
. (3)
4
Hence, the autoregressive component only depends on LF values of y. Let us consider now
the x variables, which are observable at high frequency tm
. Each HF xitm
influences the
LF variable y via a polynomial (L)bj
(L)(L) = bj
(L)(L)(L), j = 1, ..., N. We see that
it is a particular combination of high-frequency values of xj
, equal to (L)(L)xjtm
, that
affects the low-frequency values of y.
Only under certain, rather strict conditions, it is possible to recover the polynomials
a(L) and bj
(L) that appear in the HF model for y from the MF model, and in these cases
also (L) can be identified. Therefore, when (L) cannot be identified, we can estimate a
model as
c(Lk)(L)ytm
= 1
(L)x1tm-1
+ ... + N
(L)xNtm-1
+ tm
, (4)
tm
= m, 2m, 3m, ...
where c(Lm) = (1 - c1
Lm - ... - cc
Lmc), j
(L) = (j,0
+ j,1
L + ... + j,v
Lv), j = 1, ..., N.
We can focus now on the error term of equation (3). In general, there is an MA
component in the MF model, q(Lm)uytm
, with q(Lm) = (1+q1
Lm +...+qq
Lmq). The order
of q(Lm), q, coincides with the highest multiple of m non zero lag in the autocovariance
function of (L)(L)eytm
. The coefficients of the MA component have to be such that the
implied autocovariances of q(Lm)uytm
coincide with those of (L)(L)eytm
evaluated at all
multiples of m. Consequently, also the error term tm
in the approximate mixed frequency
model (4), which is the UMIDAS model, in general has an MA structure. It can be shown
that the maximum order of the MA structure is p for average sampling and p-1 for point-
in-time sampling, where p is the order of the AR component in the high frequency model
for ytm
(see, e.g., Marcellino (1999) for a derivation of this results).
2.2 Two analytical examples
In this section, we consider two simple DGPs and show that, even in these basic cases,
an MA component appears in the mixed frequency model. In the first example, we consider
an ARDL(1,1) with average sampling, in the second one an ARDL(2,2) with point-in-time
sampling. In both cases, we work with monthly and quarterly variables, therefore m = 3,
as in the empirical applications that will be presented later on. The examples could be
easily generalized to consider higher order models and different frequency mismatches m.
5
ARDL(1,1) with average sampling
Let us assume an ARDL(1,1) as HF DGP:
ytm
= aytm-1
+ bxtm-1
+ eytm
, (5)
where ytm
is a variable unobservable at HF, xtm
is the high-frequency variable, eytm
is white
noise, and tm
is the high-frequency time index. Although we do not observe ytm
, we observe
the quarterly aggregated values of the series.
In order to obtain the model for the quarterly aggregated series, let us write (5) as
(1 - aL) ytm
= bLxtm
+ eytm
. (6)
We consider average sampling, and therefore we define the aggregation operator  (L) =
1 + L + L2. Then, we first introduce a polynomial in the lag operator, (L), which is such
that the product h(L) = (L) (1 - aL) only contains powers of L3. This polynomial exists
and it is equal to (1 + aL + a2L2) . We then multiply both sides of equation (6) by  (L)
and  (L) and we obtain:
1 + aL + a2L2 (1 - aL) 1 + L + L2 ytm
= 1 + aL + a2L2 bL 1 + L + L2 xtm
+
1 + aL + a2L2 1 + L + L2 eytm
, (7)
or equivalently:
1 - a3L3 ytm
= 1 + aL + a2L2 bL 1 + L + L2 xtm
+
1 + (a + 1) L + a2 + a + 1 L2 + a2 + a L3 + a2L4 eytm
, (8)
where ytm
= (1 + L + L2) ytm
and tm
= 3, 6, 9, ... .
As we saw it in Section 2.1, the order of the MA component coincides with the highest
multiple of 3 non zero lag in the autocovariance function of the error term in equation (8),
and it is bounded above by the AR order of the model for ytm
.
Eq. (8) is then estimated at quarterly frequency, but making use of all the information
available in the HF variable xtm
, and including the MA component, which is of order 1
in this case (being the relevant lag for the quarterly model L3). The model in eq. (8) is
therefore a UMIDAS-AR with an MA(1) component.
6
ARDL(2,2) with point-in-time sampling
Let us now assume an ARDL(2,2) as HF DGP:
ytm
= a1
ytm-1
+ a2
ytm-2
+ b1
xtm-1
+ b2
xtm-2
+ eytm
, (9)
or, equivalently,
1 - a1
L - a2
L2 ytm
= b1
L + b2
L2 xtm
+ eytm
, (10)
where ytm
, xtm
, eytm
and tm
are defined as in the previous example.
We consider point-in-time sampling, and therefore  (L) = 1. Next, we need to multiply
both sides of equation (9) by (L) and find a polynomial (L) such that the product
h(L) = (L) (1 - a1
L - a2
L2) only contains powers of L3. In can be easily shown that
 (L) exists and it is equal to
1 + a1
L + a2
1
+ a2
L2 - a1
a2
L3 + a2
2
L4 .
The resulting mixed frequency model for the low-frequency variable is:
1 - a3
1
+ 3a2
a1
L3 - a3
2
L6 ytm
= 1 + a1
L + a2
1
+ a2
L2 - a1
a2
L3 + a2
2
L4 b1
L + b2
L2 xtm
+
1 + a1
L + a2
1
+ a2
L2 - a1
a2
L3 + a2
2
L4 eytm
, (11)
with tm
= 3, 6, 9, ... Hence, also in this case there is an MA component in the mixed
frequency model for y. Its order coincides with the highest multiple of 3 non zero lag
in the autocovariance function of (1 + a1
L + (a2
1
+ a2
) L2 - a1
a2
L3 + a2
2
L4) eytm
, and it is
bounded above by the AR order of the model for ytm
minus one, which is 1 in this example.
Following the same line of reasoning as in the previous example, the MA component is of
order 1.
3 UMIDAS-ARMA and MIDAS-ARMA: forecasting
specifications and estimation
We describe now in more detail the model specifications we consider for forecasting,
and the estimation details. We first recall the main features of the standard MIDAS
7
regression, introduced by Ghysels et al. (2006), and its unrestricted version, as in Foroni
et al. (2015). Then, we discuss their extensions to allow for an MA component and we
discuss the estimation of the models.
The starting point for our MF models is equation (4). In order to simplify the notation,
we assume (L) = 1 and one explanatory variable xtm
2. Further, we allow for incorporat-
ing leads of the high frequency variable in the projections, which captures asynchronous
releases.
The equation we are going to estimate to generate an hm
-step ahead forecast is the
following:
ytm
= ~
c(Lm)ytm-hm
+ (L)xtm-hm+w
+ tm
, (12)
where ~
c(Lm) is a modified lag structure of equation (4) to obtain a direct forecast and w
is the number of months with which x is leading y.
If tm
is serially uncorrelated, equation (12) represents the UMIDAS-AR model. Given
that the model is linear, the UMIDAS-AR regression can be estimated by simple OLS.
Empirically, the lag length of the high frequency variable x is often selected by means of
an information criterion, such as the BIC.
Adding an MA component to the UMIDAS-AR yields the UMIDAS-ARMA model:
ytm
= ~
c(Lm)ytm-hm
+ (L)xtm-hm+w
+ utm
+ q(Lm)utm-hm
, (13)
where utm
is a (weak) white noise with E(utm
) = 0 and E(utm
utm
) = 2
u
< , and all
the remaining terms stay the same as in equation (12). Given that MIDAS models are
direct forecasting tools, we decided to follow a direct approach also when modelling the
MA component.
OLS estimation of the UMIDAS-ARMA model is no longer possible, because of the
MA component in the residuals. We then estimate the model as in the standard ARMA
literature, by maximum likelihood or, as we will actually do to be coherent with the MIDAS
literature, by non-linear least squares (NLS).
2This is an innocuous simplification, as with a generic aggregation scheme (L) = 1 we could just work
with the redefined variable ~
ytm
= (L)ytm
.
8
The MIDAS-AR specification is a restricted version of the UMIDAS-AR. The MIDAS-
AR model as in Ghysels et al. (2006), specified for forecasting hm
periods ahead, can be
written as follows:
ytm
= ~
c(Lm)ytm-hm
+ B(L, )xtm-hm+w
+ tm
, (14)
where
B(L, ) =
K
j=0
b(j, )Lj,
b(j, ) =
exp(1
j + 2
j2)
K
j=0
exp(1
j + 2
j2)
,
and K is the maximum number of lags included of the explanatory variable.
As it is clear by comparing equation (12) and equation (14), the MIDAS model is nested
into the UMIDAS model.
The MIDAS-AR model in equation (14) is estimated by NLS. Given that it is hm
-
dependent, as in the UMIDAS case it has to be re-estimated for each forecast horizon.
Exactly as for the UMIDAS, we extend the MIDAS-AR in equation (14) to incorporate
an MA component:
ytm
= ~
c(Lm)ytm-hm
+ B(L, )xtm-hm+w
+ utm
+ q(Lm)utm-hm
, (15)
where the error term is defined as in (13). Given the nonlinearity of the model, we estimate
its parameters by NLS. Appendix A provides additional details on the NLS estimation
procedures.
To conclude, it is worth briefly comparing the use for forecasting of UMIDAS-ARMA
versus the Kalman filter. The latter is clearly optimal in the presence of mixed frequency
data and linear models. However, UMIDAS-ARMA is equivalent if it is theoretically derived
from a known high frequency linear dynamic model, as UMIDAS-ARMA coincides with
the mixed frequency data generating process. The ranking of the two approaches is unclear
if the high frequency model is mis-specified. Moreover, the Kalman filter can incur into
computational problems when the frequency mismatch is large. Something similar happens
to UMIDAS-ARMA, due to parameter proliferation, and in this case the parsimony of
MIDAS-ARMA can be particularly helpful. Bai et al. (2013) propose a more detailed
comparison of the Kalman filter and the MIDAS approach.
9
4 Monte Carlo evaluation
We now assess the forecasting relevance of including an MA component in MIDAS and
UMIDAS models by means of simulation experiments. We use two designs, closely related
to the two analytical examples described in Section 2.2. We present first the Monte Carlo
designs and then the results.
4.1 Monte Carlo design
In the first design, the DGP is the HF ARDL(1,1):
ytm
= ytm-1
+ l
xtm-1
+ ey,tm
, (16)
where ytm
is unobservable at HF, but available at LF, while xtm
is the HF variable, tm
is the
HF time index, the aggregation frequency is m = 3 (as in the case of quarterly and monthly
frequencies), and t is the LF time index, with t = 3tm
. We assume that (L) = 1 + L + L2,
corresponding to average sampling.
The shocks ey,tm
are independent and sampled from a normal distribution with zero
mean and variance chosen such that the unconditional variance of y is equal to one. We
consider different combinations of  and l
, representing different degrees of persistence
and correlation between the HF and the LF variables. In detail, we evaluate the following
parameter sets:
(, l
) = {(0.1, 0.1) , (0.5, 0.1) , (0.9, 1) , (0.94, 1)} . (17)
Finally, xtm
is generated as an AR(1) with coefficient .
In the second design, the DGP is the HF ARDL(2,2):
ytm
= 1
ytm-1
+ 2
ytm-2
+ l1
xtm-1
+ l2
xtm-2
+ ey,tm
. (18)
We still assume m = 3 but now (L) = 1, so that the LF variable is skip-sampled every
m = 3 observations.
In this second DGP, we consider the following parameter combinations:
(1
, 2
, l1
, l2
) = {(0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1) , (0.125, 0.5, 0.125, 0.5) , (0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 1)} . (19)
10
All the other design features are as in the first DGP.
We focus on typical sample sizes for the estimation sample, with T = 50, 100. The size
of the evaluation sample is set to 50, and the estimation sample is recursively expanded as
we progress in the recursive forecasting exercise. The number of replications is 500.
The competing forecasting models are the following:
1. A MIDAS-AR model, with 12 lags in the exogenous HF variable and 1 lag in the AR
component;
2. A MIDAS-ARMA model, as in the previous point but with the addition of an MA
component;
3. A MIDAS-ARMA model, with only 3 lags in the exogenous HF variable and 1 AR
lag;
4. A UMIDAS-AR model, with lag length selected according to the BIC criterion, where
the maximum lag length is set equal to 12;
5. A UMIDAS-ARMA model, as in the previous point, with the addition of an MA
component;
6. A UMIDAS-ARMA, fixing at 3 the number of lags of the HF exogenous variable.
In all ARMA models there is an MA(1) component, in line with the theoretical results,
but an higher order can be allowed.
We evaluate the competing one-step ahead forecasts on the basis of their associated
mean square prediction error (MSE), assuming that information on the first two months
of the quarter is available (as it is common in nowcasting exercises).

4.2 Results
In Tables 1 to 4 we report the mean relative MSE across simulations, and numbers
smaller than one indicate that the model is better than the benchmark (model 1, the
standard MIDAS). We also report the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles, to provide
a measure of the dispersion in the results.
Tables 1 and 2 present the results for the first DGP (the ARDL(1,1) with average
sampling), using T = 100 in Table 1 and T = 50 in Table 2. The corresponding Tables 3
and 4 are based on the second DGP (the ARDL(2,2) with point-in-time sampling).
A few key findings emerge. First, adding an MA component to the MIDAS model
generally helps. The gains are not very large but they are visible at all percentiles, with a
few exceptions for the second DGP. The gains are larger either with substantial persistence
( = 0.9 or  = 0.94 in the first DGP and 1
= 0.25, 2
= 0.5 in the second DGP) or with
low persistence in the first DGP ( = 0.1), but in the latter case the result is mainly due
to a deterioration in the absolute performance of the standard MIDAS model. The more
parsimonious specification with 3 lags only of the HF variable is generally better, except
when  = 0.5.
Second, adding an MA component to the UMIDAS model is also generally helpful,
though the gains remain small.
Third, in general the MIDAS-ARMA specifications are slightly better than the UMIDAS-
ARMA specifications, though the differences are minor. This pattern is in contrast with
the findings in Foroni et al. (2015), and suggests that adding the MA component to the
MIDAS model helps somewhat in reducing the potential misspecification due to imposing
a specific lag polynomial structure.
Finally, results are consistent across sample sizes, and the models do not seem sensitive
to short sample sizes.
5 Empirical applications
In this section, we look at the performance of our MA augmented mixed frequency mod-
els in forecasting exercises with actual data. The analysis focuses on forecasting quarterly
U.S. variables.
12
In particular, we consider three relevant quarterly U.S. macroeconomic variables: real
GDP growth, real private non residential fixed investment (PNFI) growth and GDP de-
flator inflation. As monthly explanatory variables, we consider industrial production and
employment for the real GDP growth and the PNFI growth, while we consider CPI infla-
tion and personal consumption inflation for the GDP deflator. A complete description of
data sources and transformations is available in Table 5.
The total sample spans over 50 years of data, from the first quarter of 1960 to the end
of 2015. The forecasts are computed in pseudo real time, with progressively expanding
samples. The evaluation period goes from 1980Q1 to the end of the sample, covering
roughly 35 years. As a robustness check, we will also analyze a shorter sample ending
in 2007Q3, to assess the effects of the recent crisis. At each point in time, we compute
forecasts from 1- up to 4-quarter ahead. The forecasting target is the annualized growth
rate. Although the information contained in the monthly variables updates every month,
we focus on the case in which the first two months of the quarter are already available.3
We consider the models (1) to (7) as described in Section 4.1, plus a simple low frequency
AR(1) model as a further benchmark for the usefulness of the mixed-frequency data. In
particular, we consider the direct forecast resulting from the model:
yt
= c + yt-h
+ et
. (20)
We evaluate the forecasts both in terms of mean squared errors (MSE) and in terms of
mean absolute errors (MAE). We then compare the forecasting performance relative to a
standard MIDAS model with an autoregressive component and 12 lags of the explanatory
variable (as the model (1) in Section 4).
In Tables 6 to 8 we report the results for, respectively, the real GDP growth, the real
PNFI growth and the GDP deflator inflation rate. Each table is organized in the same way:
it reports the value of MSE and MAE for each model, the ratio of those criteria for each
model relative to the MIDAS-AR, our benchmark model, and the p-value of the Diebold-
Mariano test, to check the statistical significance of the differences in forecast measures
with respect to the benchmark (see Diebold and Mariano (1995)).
3With the MIDAS setup, we could also report the results when no information or only one month of
information is available. However, for the sake of conciseness we focus only on the case in which we are
two months into the quarter, to have the shortest nowcast horizon. Given that our models are all mixed
frequency, this choice does not bias the comparison.
13
The tables are broadly supportive of the inclusion of the MA component in the mixed
frequency models, as the MSE and MAE ratios are often smaller than one for the MIDAS-
ARMA and UMIDAS-ARMA models when compared with their versions without MA.4
More in detail: for forecasting GDP growth, adding the MA component does not provide
substantial improvements with respect to standard mixed frequency models for h = 1,
with industrial production being the best indicator. When h = 2, employment becomes
better than industrial production, and adding an MA term matters, with gains of 8% for
the MIDAS-ARMA model. A similar results holds for h = 3, with gains increasing to
20%. Four-quarter ahead, industrial production returns best, and MIDAS-ARMA leads to
a decrease of 10% in the MSE. For PNFI growth, MIDAS-ARMA is best at all horizons,
with employment preferred to industrial production except for h = 1. The gains are
small for h = 1, 2, 3, in the range 1%-8%, but increase to 30% for h = 4. For GDP
deflator, PCE inflation is systematically better than CPI, and MIDAS-ARMA yields gains
for h = 1 and 2 of, respectively, 15% and 10%. It is also worth mentioning that MSE
and MAE lead to the same rankings, and that the gains from adding the MA parts are
generally statistically significant. Finally, the models perform well with respect to the AR
benchmark. Confirming the widespread evidence in the literature, the mixed frequency
models perform the best at short horizons. However, we get satisfactory results also up to
h = 4.
We now decompose the MSE in bias and variance, as:
MSE = (E(e))2
Bias
+ V ar(e)
Variance
(21)
with e = y - ^
y. We find that the MA part helps especially in reducing the bias, suggesting
that the MA part is important to well approximate the conditional mean of y (the optimal
forecast under the quadratic loss). When the models with the MA component are not
performing well, this is due especially to the variance term, instead. Detailed results on
the bias/variance decomposition are presented in Table 9. In particular, in the table we
report the ratio of the bias and of the variance of each model relative to the bias and
variance of the MIDAS-AR model, which is taken as a benchmark.
The MSE and MAE are computed over the entire evaluation sample. To check whether
the performance of our models remains good across the entire sample, in Figure 1 we report
4The models which include an MA component are indicated in bold in the tables, while the lowest MSE
and MAE values are underlined.

the one-quarter ahead forecasts of the benchmark MIDAS-AR model and of one of the MA
augmented models, together with the realized series. In Figure 2, instead, we report the
4-quarter ahead forecasts.5 It turns out that, on average, MIDAS models perform well
throughout the sample, both with and without an MA component.
Tables 10 and 11 report the full-sample estimates of MA coefficients in MIDAS-ARMA
and UMIDAS-ARMA models that have been used in the forecasting exercise. The cor-
responding t-statistics are shown in parentheses. We observe that many MA coefficients
are significant. For instance, MA(1) coefficient in MIDAS-ARMA-3lags model on GDP
growth equation with employment growth is precisely estimated at horizons h = 1, 2, 3.
This MIDAS-ARMA model was also the best in out-of-sample forecasting exercise, see ta-
ble 6. In case of PNFI, when forecasting one quarter ahead with industrial production as
high frequency predictor, MA coefficient is significant in all models. Same result holds at
longer horizons with employment growth. When it comes to GDP deflator prediction, an
interesting finding is that the MA(2) component is highly strong and significant for most
of the horizons and models.
Finally, to assess whether our results are robust to the exclusion of the recent crisis,
we have rerun the forecast evaluation over a sample ending in 2007Q3. Results do not
change substantially, and remain broadly supportive of the inclusion of the MA component
in the mixed-frequency models. In most of the cases, the best performing model up to
2007 remains the best in the full sample. The magnitude of improvements is also very
comparable. Detailed results are provided in Appendix B.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we start from the observation that temporal aggregation in general in-
troduces a moving average component in the aggregated model. We show that a similar
feature also emerges when not all but only a few variables are aggregated, which generates
a mixed frequency model. Hence, an MA component should be added to mixed frequency
models, while this is generally neglected in the literature.
We illustrate in a set of Monte Carlo simulations that indeed adding an MA compo-
nent to MIDAS and UMIDAS models further improves their nowcasting and forecasting

other models, other forecast horizons and other explanatory variables are available upon request.

abilities, though in general the gains are limited and particularly evident in the presence
of persistence. Interestingly, the relative performance of MIDAS versus UMIDAS further
improves when adding an MA component, with the latter attenuating the effects of impos-
ing a particular polynomial structure in the dynamic response of the low frequency to the
high frequency variable.
A similar pattern emerges in an empirical exercise based on actual data. Specifically,
we find that the inclusion of an MA component can substantially improve the forecasting
performance of quarterly macroeconomic U.S. variables, as GDP growth, PNFI growth and
GDP deflator inflation. MIDAS-ARMA models perform particularly well, suggesting that
the addition of an MA component to the MIDAS model helps somewhat in reducing the
potential misspecification due to imposing a specific lag polynomial structure. Finally, full
sample estimates of MA coefficients are significant and important in most of MIDAS-ARMA
and UMIDAS-ARMA specifications.

Note: The table reports the results on the forecasting performance of the different models. In the columns
"value" we report the MSE and the MAE respectively. In the columns "ratio" we report the MSE and
MAE of each model relative to the MIDAS-AR benchmark. In the columns "DM" we report the p-value of
the Diebold-Mariano test. The forecasts are evaluated over the sample 1980Q1-2015Q4. The lowest values
for each variable are underlined.

A Estimation of (U)MIDAS-ARMA models
In this section we detail the algorithm used to estimate the (U)MIDAS-ARMA models
with non-linear least squares (NLS).
A.1 NLS estimation of MIDAS-ARMA
The MIDAS-ARMA specification is as in (15):
ytm
= ~
c(Lm)ytm-hm
+ B(L, )xtm-hm+w
+ utm
+ q(Lm)utm-hm
.
The estimation procedure, for given orders of the lag polynomials, consists of the following
steps:
Step 1 Get initial values for all the parameters but q(Lm) following Foroni et al. (2015) (the
starting values are chosen with a grid search over a set of values for , which minimize
the residual sum of squares). Set the initial values for q(Lm). We initialize the MA
coefficients by a draw from the uniform U(0.1, 0.5) distribution. In principle, it is
possible to include the selection of initial value of q(Lm) into the grid search.
Step 2 Estimate all the parameters, including the weights in the Almon polynomial, simul-
taneously by NLS, numerically minimizing the residual sum of squares, starting from
the initial values obtained in Step 1.
A.2 NLS estimation of UMIDAS-ARMA
The UMIDAS-ARMA specification is as in (13):
ytm
= ~
c(Lm)ytm-hm
+ (L)xtm-hm+w
+ utm
+ q(Lm)utm-hm
,
with p, d and r being the lag orders of ~
c(Lm), (L) and q(Lm) respectively. The
estimation procedure consists of the following steps:
32
Step 1 Get the initial values for all the parameters but q(Lm) by projecting ytm
on p
j=0
ytm-hm-j
and d
j=0
xtm-hm+w-j
. Set the initial value for q(Lm). We initialize the MA coeffi-
cients by a draw from the uniform U(0.1, 0.5) distribution. In principle, it is possible
to perform a grid search and find a set of starting values of q(Lm) which minimize
the residual sum of squares.
Step 2 Estimate all the parameters simultaneously by NLS, numerically minimizing the resid-
ual sum of squares, starting from the initial values obtained in Step 1.
B Evaluation excluding the Great Recession
To see whether our results are robust, and not driven by the Great Recession, we
recompute the forecast evaluation stopping our evaluation sample in 2007Q3.
Tables 12 to 14 are the equivalent of Tables 6 to 8 for the full sample. Results do not
change substantially, and remain broadly supportive of the inclusion of the MA component
in the mixed-frequency models. In most of the cases, the best performing model up to
2007 stays the best in the full sample also. Also the magnitude of improvements is very
comparable.
