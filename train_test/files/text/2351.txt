Background: The consumption of alcohol by college students is a significant public health
concern, and a large amount of literature explores this issue. Much of the focus is on the preva-
lence and correlates of binge drinking. Relatively few studies explore reductions in drinking,
and these generally focus on reductions that occur during college.
Aims: We examined the transition between high school and college and sought to understand
the characteristics and behaviors of students that are related to reductions in the consumption
of alcohol during this transition.
Methods: We used data from all four rounds of the Harvard School of Public Health's College
Alcohol Survey and logistic regression models to relate the status of reduced alcohol consump-
tion to five groups of variables: demographic and parental variables, other substance use, social
environment, student activities, and alcohol policies.
Results: A number of characteristics were related to reductions in drinking. Students whose
fathers did not attend college were more likely to reduce alcohol consumption (odds ratio
[OR] =1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.06­1.55), whereas students who prioritize parties
(OR =0.35; CI =0.30­0.43) and who have recently smoked cigarettes (OR =0.52; CI =0.41­0.64)
or marijuana (OR =0.52; CI =0.40­0.67) or whose fathers are moderate (OR =0.73; CI =0.55­0.96)
or heavy (OR =0.72; CI =0.53­0.96) drinkers were less likely to reduce alcohol consumption.
Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of family background and social environ-
ment on reductions in drinking.
Keywords: binge drinking, College Alcohol Study, college drinking, reductions in alcohol
consumption
Introduction
High rates of alcohol consumption among college students have been shown to have
significant consequences.1­5 For example, alcohol-related deaths among 18 to 24-year-old
college students in the United States are estimated to have increased from 1,442 in 1998
to 1,825 in 2005, and in 2001 almost 700,000 students were estimated to have experienced
some type of assault by other students who had been drinking.5 Of particular concern
is "binge drinking", defined throughout this paper as the consumption of five or more
drinks by men and four or more drinks by women on one occasion. Using this definition,
surveys of US college students indicate that over 40 percent are binge drinkers.6
A number of studies have looked at factors associated with increases in drinking
between high school and college in the US. These studies consider, for example, the
initiation of any drinking7 and the initiation of binge drinking8 between high school and
freshman year of college; lifetime exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs and

subsequent patterns of use before and during college;9 and
increases in men's drinking behavior, including binge 
drinking,
between high school and the first month of college.10
Despite the potential to learn about students' drinking
behavior by studying students who reduce their consumption,
there are relatively few studies of reductions in drinking, and
most of these consider reductions that occur during college
rather than during the transition to college.These include US
studies of changes in alcohol consumption during college
allowing for increases and decreases in consumption11 and of
the cessation of binge drinking.12 Research has also explored
the roles of alcohol education, social norms campaigns,
alcohol counter-marketing, and alcohol control policies on
US colleges and universities in reducing consumption by
college students during college.13
In contrast to these studies of reductions during college,
a few studies consider reductions between high school and
college.9,14,15 For example, Reifman and Watson14 explored
factors associated with changes in binge drinking behavior
between high school and college and found that approxi-
mately 15 percent of all students were binge drinkers in high
school but not in college. Of students who were binge drink-
ers in high school, 31 percent were categorized as not being
binge drinkers in college. Their analysis found that social
variables such as networks of friends and the importance of
parties were significant factors in continuing versus stopping
binge drinking in college.
In a similar spirit, we seek to identify the characteristics
and behaviors of students that are related to reductions in
alcohol consumption between senior year of high school and
freshman year of college. It is important to understand this
relationship because, as noted by Reifman and 
Watson,14
"... to get high school binge drinkers to abandon this

behavior, health educators should know the psychosocial
factors that are associated empirically with transitions in
student drinking." In comparison with this earlier study,
which was based on data from a single school, our analysis
uses all 4 years of the Harvard School of Public Health

College Alcohol Survey, a nationally representative data
source, and we expand our analysis to include non-binge
drinkers, thereby allowing us to study reductions in alcohol
consumption by all drinkers.
Methods
The data for this study come from the 1993, 1997, 1999,
and 2001 rounds of the Harvard School of Public Health's
College Alcohol Survey.6,16­18 Each year, surveys were sent
to random samples of students at up to 140 universities and
colleges in the US. Over the 4 years, the number of schools
varied from 140 in 1993 to 116 in 1997. In both 1999 and
2001, 119 schools participated in the survey. Response
rates were approximately 70 percent in 1993, 59 percent in
1997, 59 percent in 1999, and 52 percent in 2001,6 and the
resulting sample sizes were 15,282, 14,428, 13,954, and
10,904 in those years, respectively.19­22 The surveys contain
information on student life, beliefs about alcohol policies,
own alcohol consumption, use of alcohol by other students,
other personal behaviors, student activities, and background
information.
Measures of alcohol consumption
Respondents were asked two questions about their alcohol
consumption during senior year of high school. The first
question asked how many times a month the student usually
consumed alcohol, and the second asked the number of drinks
usually consumed. We consider students who report never
drinking when answering both questions to be "nondrinkers"
during high school. Female students who usually consumed
four or more drinks and male students who usually consumed
five or more drinks are considered high school binge drinkers.
Although binge drinking typically refers to occasional rather
than usual behavior, we call high school students who usually
consume four or five drinks binge drinkers for consistency
with the description of college drinkers. Those who drank
but did not usually binge drink are considered high school
non-binge drinkers.
Additionally, a number of questions were asked about
alcohol consumption during college. Students were asked how
many times they consumed exactly four drinks or five or more
drinks within the past 2 weeks. Women who had consumed
four or more drinks and men who had consumed five or
more drinks are classified as binge drinkers during freshman
year. Students who did not binge drink but who had reported
consuming alcohol within the past 30 days are classified as
freshman non-binge drinkers, and students who had not con-
sumed alcohol within the past 30 days are classified as fresh-
man non-drinkers. Questions about non-binge drinking were
asked, with recall periods of 1 week and 30 days, and most
of the literature uses recall periods of either 2 weeks6,8,13,16­18
or the past 30 days,12,15 so we chose to measure non-binge
drinking over 30 days rather than 1 week.
Given these definitions, a reduction in drinking can
happen in one of three ways. First, a student who drinks
but does not usually binge drink in high school can stop

drinking. 
Second, a student who binges in high school can
stop drinking. Third, a student who usually binge drank

Reductions in alcohol use between high school and college
during senior year can cut back to non-binge drinking. We
do not distinguish among these different changes. Across
all 4 survey years, we find that 11.3 percent of all students
(including those who do not drink) reduced drinking between
senior year of high school and freshman year of college,
and that 21.6 percent of high school binge drinkers reduced
their consumption during freshman year. These figures are
similar to, but smaller than, those reported by Reifman and
Watson.14
Explanatory variables
In the existing literature, explanatory variables are typically
grouped into a number of categories where the specific
categories depend on the question of interest. Because we
are exploring a number of different possible relationships,
we use variables from a number of different categories:
demographic and parental background characteristics,7,14,15,23
other substance abuse,9 the consequences of other students'
alcohol use,6,16­18 the social environment (including living
arrangements),8,14,23­25 student activities,14 and attitudes toward
alcohol policy and exposure to alcohol education.8,13
Background variables include indicators for male; race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-
HispanicAsian, non-Hispanic other race, and Hispanic); reli-
gion (catholic, protestant, other religion, and not religious);
whether the student reported that the student's mother or
father was not a drinker or was a light, moderate, or heavy
drinker; whether the student's family approved of alcohol
use; and whether the student's mother or father had a high
school education or less.
Although students were asked to provide only one race,
a handful of individuals provided more than one answer.
Because there were not enough of these individuals to include
a separate category for multiple race, race for these individu-
als is coded as the category having the least representation
in the data. In the analysis below, female is the omitted
category for sex, non-Hispanic white for race/ethnicity, not
religious for religion, and mother and father not drinking for
the parental drinking variables.
To allow for the fact that some substances may be comple-
ments, we next considered the use of cannabis, cigarettes, and
powder cocaine. For each of these substances, two variables
were created. The first indicates that the student has never
used that substance, and the second that the student has used
it within the past 30 days. Thus, for each substance, the base
group is students who have used the substance at some point
in their lives but not in the past 30 days. Additionally, to
capture the possibility that negative consequences of others'
behavior may affect reductions, we include an indicator
of whether the drinking of others led to the student being
pushed, hit, or assaulted, and an indicator of whether the
drinking of others resulted in an argument.
Social variables include the number of good friends a
student reports having (categorized as zero to two, three or
four, and five or more), whether the student reports knowing
a faculty member or administrator to whom he or she could
talk about problems, membership in a fraternity or sorority,
and living in a coed dorm, other on-campus housing, off
campus but not with parents/other relatives, and off campus
with parents/other relatives. Other social variables include
indicators equal to one if participation in parties or fraternity/
sorority life is very important or important to the student, an
indicator equal to one if the student has had multiple sexual
partners in the past 30 days, and the average number of hours
per day spent on social activities.
A number of variables measure participation in, and atti-
tudes toward, student activities. These include the average
hours per day studying, working for pay, watching television,
working with organizations, engaging in physical activity,
and volunteer activities. Each of the time use variables is
coded as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (=5 or more) hours.Also included
are indicators for whether it is important or very important
for the student to participate in academic work, religious
activities, the arts, or political activities.
The last group of variables measures whether the stu-
dent believes that the legal drinking age should be less
than 21 years, his or her exposure to a number of alcohol
education messages, and the avenues through which the
alcohol education was received. The alcohol education
messages include information about where to obtain help
with alcohol problems, the long-term effects of alcohol use,
the dangers of alcohol use, and how to recognize problems
with alcohol.The ways in which the messages were received
include attending lectures, meetings, or workshops; mailings
or handouts; posters or signs; announcements or articles in
student newspapers; or through a special course on alcohol
and other student life issues.
Statistical methods
Sampling weights are available in the College Alcohol
Survey, and all analyses use these weights. The statistical
analysis was conducted using Stata 11.2 (StataCorp LP,

College Station,TX, USA) using the svy suite of commands
to accommodate the nonrandom sampling.
Two approaches were used to analyze the data. The first
is a comparison of proportions (except for a few 
variables

measuring time spent in various activities, which are 
measured
in hours) for students who do and who do not reduce their alco-
hol consumption using the "svy: mean" command in Stata. For
each variable included in the analysis, we tested the hypothesis
thattheaverageforthegroupthatreducesconsumptionisequal
to the average for the group that does not reduce consumption,
and we report the P-value for each hypothesis test. Hypothesis
testing is conducted using the "test" command in Stata. The
results of this analysis are reported in Table 1.
Testing for differences in proportions ignores the fact
that many of these characteristics are related to each other,
and we use a logistic regression model to allow for multiple
variables to jointly affect the decision to reduce drinking
or not. The explanatory variables are entered in groups. As
described previously, the groups of variables (background
characteristics, other substance use, the consequences of

others'alcohol use, social environment, student activities, and
policies) are motivated by the previous literature. The order
of inclusion moves broadly from more personal variables
(eg, background and substance use) to variables that measure
university activities (eg, policy variables). Logistic regression
models are estimated using the "svy: logit" command.
The results of logistic regressions are reported as odds
ratios (ORs).An OR greater than 1 indicates that an increase
in the characteristic is associated with an increase in the odds
of cutting back on alcohol, whereas an OR less than 1 indi-
cates that an increase in the characteristic is associated with
a decrease in the odds of reducing alcohol consumption. In
addition to the OR, the tables include 95 percent confidence
intervals for each OR, and the P-value for the hypothesis test
that the OR is equal to 1.
The results are reported inTables 2­6.Table 2 reports the
results of a model that includes only background variables,
and Tables 3 through 6 each add one group of variables
in turn. Each model includes all of the variables included
in the previous models, but, to conserve space, the tables
report only the OR for the newly added variables. To assess
whether the groups of previous variables remain statisti-
cally relevant, each table includes an F-statistic for each
previously added group of variables. The null hypothesis
is that the OR for each variable in the group under test is
jointly equal to 1.
Descriptive statistics
We limited our analysis sample to students who are 18 or 19
years old, unmarried, and not missing data on key variables.
Because we wished to understand reductions in alcohol
consumption between high school and college, the analysis
sample was also limited to students who reported drinking
alcohol during their senior year of high school.The resulting
sample contains 5,106 students. Of these, almost 22 percent
(n=1,101) reduced their alcohol consumption as previously
defined. The remaining 78 percent of students (n=4,005)
either continued to drink at their previous level (eg, was
a non-binge drinker in both high school and college) or
increased their consumption in college (eg, was a non-binge
drinker in high school and a binge drinker in college).Table 1
provides descriptive statistics for those who reduced their
alcohol consumption and those who did not.The two samples
differ significantly in almost all characteristics considered.
For example, students who reduced consumption were more
likely to be female, less likely to be white, more likely to have
parents who did not approve of drinking, and more likely to
abstain from other substance use.
Results from adjusted logistic
regression models
Demographic and parental variables
Table 2 presents the results of the adjusted model, which
includes the demographic or background variables.
The results indicate that being male and catholic or another
religion was associated with lower odds of reducing alcohol
consumption. Compared with having parents who abstained,
students with parents who drank moderately or heavily had
lower odds of reducing their alcohol consumption. In contrast,
being Asian, Hispanic, or black (relative to non-Hispanic
white); having parents who disapprove of alcohol consump-
tion; and having a father who did not attend college were all
associated with increased odds of cutting back on alcohol
consumption.
Other substance use
We next added variables describing the student's use of other
substances and his or her experience with the consequences
of other students' drinking during college. These results are
presented in Table 3. Having never smoked marijuana or
used cocaine was associated with increased odds of reduc-
ing alcohol consumption, whereas having smoked ciga-
rettes or marijuana in the past 30 days decreased the odds.
Having been hit or assaulted by, or in an argument with,
someone due to their drinking was associated with lower
odds of reducing consumption. Although the ORs for the
background variables are not displayed, the results for the
background variables were generally similar to those in
Table 2, and the background variables remained jointly

statistically significant, as measured by the F-statistic.

weights provided in the surveys. "P-value" is the P-value for a hypothesis test that the average for students to reduce consumption is equal to the average for students who
do not reduce consumption; bAll variables are proportions except for those that measure time spent on various activities, which are measured in hours.
Social environment
The next specification adds variables describing the stu-
dent's social environment, and results of this specification
are reported in Table 4. We find that living in a coed dorm
(relative to a single sex dorm) lowered the odds of drinking
less, whereas living off campus increased the odds.The odds
of reducing alcohol consumption were significantly lower
for students for whom it was important or very important
to participate in fraternity or sorority life, for students for
whom it was important or very important to participate in
parties, for students who were members of fraternities or
sororities, for students with five or more good friends, and for
students who spent more time on social activities. The ORs

Reductions in alcohol use between high school and college
for the background and substance use variables were largely
unchanged, and the F-statistics showed that these variables
remained jointly statistically significant.
Student activity variables
Table 5 reports the results of the next specification that adds
variables describing the student's interest in, and time spent
on, a number of activities. Relatively few of the student activi-
ties variables were statistically associated with reductions in
drinking. Believing that participating in community service
activities is important or very important was associated with
an increase in the likelihood of drinking less, as was time
spent working and watching television. The effects of the
previously considered variables were largely unchanged.
Policy variables
Finally, Table 6 adds variables describing alcohol education
policies the student has been exposed to, the setting in which
the student has been exposed to these messages, and the stu-
dent's belief about whether the legal drinking age should be
less than 21 years. Students who believed that the drinking
age should be less than 21 years were significantly less likely
to reduce their alcohol consumption (recall these students
are all 18 or 19 years old). The only statistically significant
effect of alcohol education was that receiving information
through posters on campus reduces the likelihood of drink-
ing less.The F-statistics showed that each group of variables
remained statistically related to reductions in consumption,
even with all other variables included.Although ORs are not
reported for all of the variables for each of the models, we
note that being male, having a mother who was a moderate
drinker, having a mother who was a heavy drinker, never
having smoked marijuana, and living off campus were no
longer statistically related to reducing alcohol consumption
in the full specification, even though they were in earlier
specifications.
Predicted probabilities
Estimates from the logistic regressions can be used to con-
struct predicted probabilities for different combinations of
explanatory variables.As an alternative way to characterize
some of the results, we construct predicted probabilities for

a number of different combinations of background char-
acteristics and social variables. We first vary the parental
drinking variables and separately vary father's education
while leaving all other variables unchanged, and present
these results in Figure 1. The first three bars show the aver-
age probabilities of reducing alcohol consumption under
the assumptions that each student's parents abstained, the
student's father was a heavy drinker and mother did not
drink, and both parents were heavy drinkers, respectively.
Compared with living in a family where both parents
abstain, living in a family where both parents are heavy
drinkers was associated with less than a 10 percentage
point reduction in the probability of cutting back on alcohol
consumption. However, the average predicted probabilities
were not statistically different from each other, as measured
by the 95% confidence intervals represented by the "error
bands" in the figure.
The remaining two bars show the probabilities assuming
first that all students have a father who did not attend college
and then assuming that all fathers had at least some college
education. In this case, the estimated probability of reducing
alcohol fell by about 4 percentage points for students whose
fathers had more than a high school education.
To better understand the magnitude of some of the key
social variables, Figure 2 repeats this exercise except that sex,
being a member of a Greek organization (social fraternity
or sorority), believing that participating in Greek life was
important or very important, and believing that participating
in parties was important or very important were the charac-
teristics that were varied.The highest probability of reducing
consumption is for women who were not associated with the
Greek system ("Greek" in this case means both membership
and believing that participation in Greek life is important) and
who did not believe that participation in parties is important.
As we compare the four male­female pairs, we see the small
estimated effect of being male. In this case, the largest effect
was for the Greek system, though that does involve changing
two variables. Unsurprisingly, the most significant reduction

Reductions in alcohol use between high school and college
occurs for students who were members of the Greek system
and who believed that participating in that system and in
parties was important or very important.
Discussion
A number of background characteristics emerge from the
analysis as being strongly and consistently related to reduc-
tions in alcohol consumption. Across all models, we found
that the odds of reducing alcohol consumption were signifi-
cantly higher for Asian and African-American students and
for students whose fathers did not attend college. The odds
of reducing alcohol consumption were significantly lower for
students whose fathers were moderate or heavy drinkers, and
there is some evidence that it was lower for students whose
mothers were moderate drinkers. Additionally, we found
some evidence that male students have lower odds of reduc-
ing alcohol consumption. Because being male is frequently
found to be a risk factor for increases in drinking,26 it is
notable that the effect of being male weakened in magnitude
and statistical significance as other predictors were added to
the model, and became statistically insignificant at conven-
tional levels in the final specification (not reported inTable 6,
OR =0.863; confidence interval =0.719­1.035).
Our finding that the odds of reducing alcohol consump-
tion were significantly higher for students whose father did
not attend college is notable and might reflect a number
of things. First, because we do not control for family income,
this result may capture an inverse relationship between family
income and the probability of reducing alcohol consumption.
Second, our finding may reflect differences in attitudes and
expectations about the college experience for those students
whose fathers did not attend college versus those whose
fathers did. It is worth further investigating why this is the
case, because this finding persisted even after controlling for
many other characteristics.
Our results further suggest that recent use of cigarettes and
marijuana lowered the odds of reducing alcohol consump-
tion, whereas recent use of cocaine was not associated with
reductions. At the same time, students who had never used
cocaine were significantly more likely to reduce their alcohol
consumption. These results suggest that using cocaine was
different from using the other substances and that drinking
alcohol and smoking either tobacco or marijuana tended to
occur together. Although we are unable to disentangle the
timing of exposure to different substances, there is evidence
that exposure to alcohol is almost universal by college (with
tobacco and marijuana not far behind), whereas exposure to
cocaine is much lower.9 Interestingly, negative consequences
of others' drinking appeared to reduce the likelihood of
curtailing alcohol consumption. This result likely reflects a
reverse causality where heavy drinkers were exposed to more
arguments and other negative consequences.
Consistent with the previous literature, we find that the
social environment matters a great deal for drinking 
behavior.
The variable with the largest effect on maintaining or increas-
ing drinking levels from high school was having the attitude
that it is important or very important to participate in parties
during college.Also significant were membership in a Greek
organization, believing that participating in fraternity and
sorority life was important or very important, having five
or more good friends, living in a coed dorm, and spending
more time in social activities. These results were robust to
the inclusion or exclusion of additional control variables.
In contrast to the relationship between drinking and atti-
tudes toward parties and Greek life, there was little relation-
ship between student priorities and activities and reductions

in drinking. Only the relationship between 
drinking and
community service achieved statistical significance. It is
perhaps not surprising to find that working more was associ-
ated with a reduction in drinking, but it is also the case that
spending more time watching television was associated with
a reduction in drinking.
The strong finding that students who believed that the
legal drinking age should be less than 21 years old were less
likely to reduce their alcohol consumption is consistent with
the literature and reinforces the theory of social norms where
the students believe that the normative behavior should be the
same as their behavior.
Limitations
It is important to keep in mind a number of limitations of
our analysis. First, although we used 4 years of data, our
analysis was fundamentally cross-sectional with retrospec-
tive reporting of high school alcohol use. To the extent that
students did not accurately remember their consumption
of alcohol or chose to misrepresent it, the analysis will be
biased. Second, the measures of alcohol used and the time
frames covered varied between high school and college and
for binge and non-binge drinking in college. High school
drinking was constructed from questions asking about usual
drinking behavior during senior year of high school, whereas
college drinking behavior was assessed more precisely over
the previous 2 weeks or 30 days. Students categorized as
binge drinkers in high school were those who reported 
usually
binge drinking, and there may have been students who occa-
sionally binge drank in high school who were not counted
as binge drinkers. However, measurement error in classify-
ing the level of drinking was somewhat moderated because
we were looking at reductions in drinking. Thus, a student
who was an occasional but not usual binge drinker was still
included in the analysis. Third, as noted earlier, we grouped
together students who were high school binge drinkers and
college non-binge drinkers, students who were high school
binge drinkers and college abstainers, and students who were
high school non-binge drinkers and college abstainers. To
the extent that different characteristics affected those groups
differently, those distinctions were lost in this analysis.
Fourth, because we used cross-sectional data without

randomization over any of the explanatory variables such as
alcohol policies and membership in Greek organizations, we
were unable to uncover causal relationships. Finally, given
the exploratory nature of our secondary data analysis, we
could not conduct a priori power analyses, so it is possible
that some of our results are underpowered.
Conclusion
High rates of alcohol consumption have been shown to have
significant consequences for college students, including
assaults and deaths. Consequently, a significant amount of
research has investigated the individual, family, and school
characteristics that are associated with increases in drinking
before and during college.A smaller number of studies exam-
ined the factors associated with decreases in consumption
during college. We explore the characteristics and behaviors
associated with reductions in alcohol consumption between
high school and college.
Our analysis uses data from the 1993, 1997, 1999, and
2001 rounds of the Harvard School of Public Health College

Alcohol Survey. Twenty-two percent of the sample reduced
their consumption of alcohol between high school and

college. We group the explanatory variables as demographic
and parental background characteristics, other substance use,
social environment, student activities, and alcohol education

experience. Using logistic regression models, we find that a
number of characteristics, including race, father's education,
smoking tobacco and marijuana, the social environment, and
attitudes toward alcohol policy, affect reductions in drinking.
