Introduction
Need for longitudinal data on smoking behavior progression
Exposure to tobacco is associated with 5.4 million deaths per year
worldwide [1] and among them, 440,000 deaths are in the United States
[2]. Despite much progress in tobacco use prevention across the globe
[3], further advancement in tobacco control requires data beyond the
static measures of prevalence rates to cover steps of smoking behavior
progression. Smoking behavior is rather complex and it involves a series
of sophisticated neurobiological, psychosocial and behavioral processes
[4-7]. Researchers who have investigated the population dynamics of
smoking behavior proposed a number of models, including but are not
limited to, Flay's five-stage model (preparatory, trying, experimental,
regular use and addicted/dependent use) [8], which was adopted by
the U.S. Department of Health Services in the 1994 Surgeon General's
Report [9]; Prochaska's Theory of Stages of Change and Transtheoretical
Model [10,11]; and Mayhew's six-stage conceptual framework that
integrates both Flay's and Prochaska's models [12]. Although these
models are promising, establishment of such models requires panel
data collected through longitudinal designs.
Collecting longitudinal data involves repeatedly following-up
of individual participants over time. This is technically demanding
and practically expensive because of increased efforts to plan and
implement such projects and increased burdens on the participants
(being repeatedly contacted) and the related entities (e.g., families,
schools, etc) [13,14]. Consequently, longitudinal surveys are relatively
scant, and such data particularly lack in the developing and transitional
counties with more than 80% of the smokers in the world but limited
resources for tobacco research and tobacco control planning and
practice [15]. Nevertheless, more longitudinal information is needed
(1) to better understand the population dynamics of smoking behavior,
(2) to locate strategically sensitive steps (e.g., smoking initiation,
quitting, relapse, etc) along the smoking behavior progression for
prevention intervention, and (3) to evaluate a prevention program on
various progression steps for improvement.
Challenges to extracting longitudinal information from
cross-sectional data
Cross-sectional data are widely available from a number of sources,
including the Global Youth Tobacco Survey, the National Survey on
Drug Use and Health (formerly known as National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse), the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance, and Monitor
the Future Studies. Although no individual participants are followed
in a cross-sectional survey, conceptually data from such surveys may
contain longitudinal information. For example, a cross-sectional survey
of a sample of participants (a) to (a+n) years old can be considered
equivalent to a longitudinal survey that follows a sample of participants,
all (a) years of age for n years. Likewise, such a cross-sectional survey is
conceptually also equivalent to a longitudinal survey with two waves of

Abstract
Background and objective: New analytical tools are needed to advance tobacco research, tobacco control
planning and tobacco use prevention practice. In this study, we validated a method to extract information from cross-
sectional survey for quantifying population dynamics of adolescent smoking behavior progression.
Methods: With a 3-stage 7-path model, probabilities of smoking behavior progression were estimated employing
the Probabilistic Discrete Event System (PDES) method and the cross-sectional data from 1997-2006 National Survey
on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Validity of the PDES method was assessed using data from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth 1997 and trends in smoking transition covering the period during which funding for tobacco control was
cut substantively in 2003 in the United States.
Results: Probabilities for all seven smoking progression paths were successfully estimated with the PDES method
and the NSDUH data. The absolute difference in the estimated probabilities between the two approaches varied from
0.002 to 0.076 (p>0.05 for all) and were highly correlated with each other (R2=0.998, p<0.01). Changes in the estimated
transitional probabilities across the 1997-2006 reflected the 2003 funding cut for tobacco control.
Conclusions: The PDES method has validity in quantifying population dynamics of smoking behavior progression
with cross-sectional survey data. The estimated transitional probabilities add new evidence supporting more advanced
tobacco research, tobacco control planning and tobacco use prevention practice. This method can be easily extended
to study other health risk behaviors.

data collection in two consecutive years for participants aged (a to n-1)
at the first and aged (a+1 to n) at the subsequent year.
PDES Method as an alternative
To formalize the approach, we use the theory of Probabilistic
Discrete-Event Systems that offers a method by which longitudinal
information can be derived from cross-sectional data. The PDES
method is an established analytical technique for modeling and
control in industry to describe assembly lines and other systems [17-
20]. According to the PDES method, a cross-sectional survey is like
a "snapshot" of the status of a system and the dynamics of a system
can be described with such snapshot data. In a previous study, we have
mathematically established the PDES method that can minimize the
impact of population variationsinbirths,deathsandsubstantial changes
in smoking prevalence on modeling by the use of state probabilities
[21]. In this study, we reported our empirical work to validate the PDES
method.
The PDES method differs from a few methods that have been
attempted by others [22,23]. In one study that focused on prediction of
smoking using a state-transition model, the transition rates of starting,
quitting and relapsing were estimated using cross-sectional data and a
restrictedquadraticmultinomialandquadraticlogisticregressionspline
[22]. However, this method did not consider changes in population and
smoking behavior. Another study employed a heterogeneous Markov
model to estimate entry and exit transition probabilities, but for this
method to work, data from at least two consecutive cross-sectional
surveys are needed [23]. In addition, none of these methods have been
validated.
Methods
Data for PDES modeling
Ten-yearcross-sectionaldatawerederivedfromtheNationalSurvey
on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) collected during the 1997-2006.
The NSDUH is an on-going effort sponsored by the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration and carried out by the
Research Triangle Institute, Cary, North Carolina through contracted
projects. The multi-stage random cluster sampling scheme was used in
the NSDUH to select participants that represent all civilian and non-
institutionalized population 12 years of age and older in the United
States. Participants 12-17 years old were included for this analysis. After
a screening test, the trained data collectors were sent to the sampled
households to administrate the survey using the Computer-Assisted
Personal Interviewing (CAPI) technique. The 1997 NSDUH data were
used for comparison with the probabilities estimated with longitudinal
data (see the section on longitudinal data later in this paper) and
the 10-year NSDUH data were used to show time trends in smoking
behavior progression. Although changes were made to the NSDUH
in 1999 (increased sample size) and 2002 (introduced incentives to
adolescents), previous studies showed limited impact of these changes
on the overall trend of cigarette smoking [24].
PDES method and smoking progression

considering probabilities of states and events, PDES models are similar

is the initial state. For example,  (idle,
startup)=working means that at "idle" stage, the event "startup" will
bring the system to "working". To simplify the notations, we also use
q
i
to denote the probability of the system being at state q
i
and use 
i
to
denote the probability of 
i
occurring.
To describe the system, multiple cross-sectional measures
(snapshots) of the system status Q will be obtained: Q(t), Q(t +T),
Q(t +2T)..., (T=sampling interval). The PDES method assumes that
the system status at time t +T depends on its status at time t and the
transitions occurred during the sampling interval [t, t +T]. Obviously,
when the system is running in a stable status, one snapshot would
contain adequate information to describe the system.
Following the assembly principle, a 3-stage model (Figure 1) was
proposed to validate the PDES method in analyzing smoking behavior.
In the model, NS=never-smokers, participants who have never smoked
by the time of survey; CS=current smokers, participants who smoked
currently; and XS=ex-smokers, participants who ever smoked and
did not smoke now, therefore Q={NS, CS, XS}. The arrowed lines in
the figure indicate the seven transition paths or events, ={

pass through the PDES system to become different types of smokers.
Likewise, data from a cross-sectional survey provides a snapshot Q

Methods and Survival Analysis
Conceiving cross-sectional surveys in a longitudinal perspective
creates a basis which supports the development of methods capable of
extracting longitudinal information from such data [16]. For example,
if from a cross-sectional survey conducted in one year, we estimated
that the number of neversmokers for participants aged 12 and 13 are
400 and 300 respectively, then the probability for a participant aged
12 to remain as a never-smoke during an one-year period would be
approximately 0.75 (=300/400). However, computing transitional
probabilities by this approach requires two additional assumptions:
(1) Changes in the number of people by age between two consecutive
years are negligible (stable population assumption as in demographic
studies for life expectancy estimation) [16] and (2) changes in smoking
behavior for individuals of the same age between two consecutive years
are also negligible compared to changes in smoking behavior across
ages in a year.
According to the PDES method, modeling an assembly system with
a number of connected workstations can be achieved through cross-
sectional assessment (snapshot) [22,23]. When the system is in running
parts for a product (e.g., a car) are continuously put into the system
and processed through various workstations to produce the needed
product. Using PDES, such an assembly system G can be described as:

Longitudinal data for validation analysis
Longitudinal data for validating the PDES model were derived
from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). The
NSLY97 is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department
of Labor and carried out by the Center for Human Resource Research,
Ohio State University. Participants were selected using the multi-stage
stratified random sampling method. Youths 12 to 16 years old by the end
of 1996 were eligible to participate and they became 12 to 18 (mean=14,
SD=1.3) in 1997 after completing the baseline survey (n=8,984), a
response rate was 72%. Data were collected by trained researchers at
home using the CAPI technique. In addition to cigarette smoking,
survey dates were collected for assessing the duration between surveys.
Estimation of transitional probabilities with longitudinal
data
We directly estimated the same seven transitional probabilities
={
1
(a),
2
(a),...,
7
(a)} by age as with the PDES method with the
NLSY97 data. In computing these transitional probabilities, we first
defined the three types of smokers NS, CS, and XS at the baseline in
1997 and the follow-up in 1998 respectively. This was conducted
following the definitions described for the PDES method above and
data derived from the following three questions: (1) "Have you ever
smoked a cigarette?" (2) During the past 30 days, on how many of the
days did you smoke a cigarette?" (3) "Have you smoked a cigarette since
the last interview on [date of last interview]?"
With the number of NS, CS, and XS by age in 1997 and 1998,
transitional probability from one type of smokers to another during
the one-year period was estimated as the ratio of the two in 1997 and
1998. Since the time interval between the two surveys for individual
participants was not equal but varied from 6-23 months, the method of
person-years at-risk was used for probability estimation [13,14].

Results
Sample characteristics and state probability
Table 1 summarizes basic demographic characteristics of the
study samples. Data in the upper panel of the table indicates that the
participants of the NSDUH varied from 8,731 in 1997 to 20,838 in 2006
with the response rates varying from a minimum of 61.4% in 1999 to
a maximum of 78.3% in 1997. These participants, 50% male and more
than 50% white, were 12-17 years old with a mean age of 14.8-15.0
(SD=1.9 to 2.0). Data in lower panel of the table indicates that among
8,984 participants of the NLSY97 aged 14.4 (SD=1.5) at baseline, 8386
(93%) participated in follow-up survey when they were on average 16.0
years old.
to MC models. However, the PDES models also consider properties
such as controllability, observability, detectability, and diagnosability
that are not considered in MC models.
Categorization of participants into different types of smokers
Figure 2 illustrates the algorithm used in this study to classify
participants into various types of smokers for analysis. To define
Q={NS, CS, XS}, data from the two questions were used. (1) "Have you
ever smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?" (yes/no) and (2) "How
long has it been since you last smoked a cigarette?" (within 30 days, 30
days to one year, one year ago and within three years, and three years
ago). Participants were classified as NS if they responded negatively
to question (1); participants will be coded as CS if they smoked
within the past 30 days based on their responses to questions (1) and
(2); participants were classified as XS if they responded positively to
question (1) and last smoking was 30 days ago.
To solve for the PDES model, three additional types of smokers were
needed: (1) NXS -- NS progressed to CS and further to XS within the past
year; (2) CXS -- CS a year ago (old CS) progressed to XS in the past year;
and (3) XXS -- XS a year ago (old XS) remained as XS in the past year
(see Figure 2 for details). To specify these three types of smokers, data
from one more question "How old (age in years) were you the first time
you smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?" was added.
Estimation of state probability and transitional probability
The state probability for each of the six smoking types described
above was computed as the proportion (%) of a type relative to the total
sample. The state probabilities were computed by age to obtain NS(a),
NXS(a), CS(a), XS(a) for a=12, 13...17 and were used as data to solve
for ={
1
(a),
2
(a),...,
7
(a)}. As an innovation of the PDES method,
utilization of the state probabilities minimizes the impact of sudden
changes in population (births, deaths) and/or smoking behavior on
transitional probability estimation [21]. To account for the complex
sampling designs used in NSDUH and NLSY97, the Proc Survey Means
was used to compute state probabilities.
To obtain transitional probabilities, the estimated state probabilities
by single year of age were converted to state probability at the beginning
of an age by taking an average of two probabilities at the consecutive
age groups. For example, [NS(12)+NS(13)]/2NS(13) is the state
probability at the beginning of age 13. With the converted state
probabilities, the following matrix equation was used to estimate all
transitional probabilities = {

Table 2 contains two sets of probabilities for the seven smoking
progression steps, one set was estimated with the cross-sectional
1997 NSDUH data and the other set was estimated with the
longitudinal NLSY97 data. According to the results from NSDUH
data, an adolescent aged 13 who have never smoked in 1997 has
88.0% (
1
=0.880) chance to remain as a never-smoker in a year; an
adolescent in the same age who was smoking has 19.3% (

chance to quit; an ex-smoker in the same age has 47.6% (

Discussion
PDES method is valid for examination of adolescent smoking
Findings of this study suggest certain validity of the newly
established PDES method [21] in estimating transitional probabilities
with cross-sectional survey data. Although only one-wave survey data
was used, the estimated probabilities from the PDES method are very
close to those computed from longitudinal data. In addition, changes in
the estimated transitional probabilities from cross-sectional data were
closely associated with the event of funding cut for tobacco control in
the United States, including funding cut from the Master Settlement
Agreement [25]. In addition to validating the method, more obvious
changes in quitting and relapsing than in other progression steps imply
higher sensitivity of these two progression steps than other steps in

Methods and Survival Analysis
A visual assessment of all results in (Table 2) indicates that the two
sets of probabilities estimated by different methods and data are close
to each other. For example, the estimated 
1
=0.880 for adolescents of 13
years of age when the PDES method was used, and the same 
1
=0.885
when the longitudinal method was used. The estimated 
6
across ages
from 13 to 17 from the PDES method varied from 0.400 to 0.476, close
to those from the longitudinal method that varied from 0.387 to 0.426.
Data in the bottom row of (Table 2) indicate the mean differences
between the two sets of estimates varied from 0.002 (SD=0.023) to
0.076 (SD=0.038), and none of them were statistically significant (t-test,
p>0.05 for all). When the two sets of the estimated probabilities were
cross-plotted, they were distributed closely around the diagonal (data
are not shown) with a very high correlation (R2= 0.988, p<0.001).

response to substantive funding cut for tobacco use prevention. This
useful evidence would not be revealed without the PDES method.
Although PDES method is not intended to replace the longitudinal
method, it adds an alternative approach for tobacco research, tobacco
control planning and tobacco use prevention practice. This method will
be of particular significance to countries and places where tobacco use
is highly prevalent while resources are limited to collect longitudinal
data [26,27].
Technical consideration in the application of the PDES
method
Cross-sectional survey data are widely available to assess tobacco
use at the state, national, and even global levels [15,28-32]. With the
PDES method, transitional probabilities can be estimated with data
from one single cross-sectional survey to assess various steps of smoking
behavior progression over time, by single year of age, and stratified by
gender, race/ethnicity to describe population dynamics of tobacco
use behavior. Transitional probabilities can also be estimated across
subgroups of significant predictor variables such as education, peer
influences, school performance, parental monitoring, and receptivity to
pro-tobacco media to assess factors associated with smoking behavior
progression.
One advantage of the PDES method is that it can be used to assess
effect from tobacco control at the macro level. When multi-year cross-
sectional data are available, like the NSDUH used in this study, time
trends of the estimated transitional probabilities with such data can be
related to various tobacco control activities (e.g., tobacco taxation, legal
restrictions, school-based programs, or tobacco cessation) to assess
effects from such effort. As we have showed in this study that reductions
in quitting and increase in relapsing in the US were associated with
sustained effort for tobacco control up to 2002 before a sudden and
substantial funding cut at the national and state level in 2003. Such
effect could not be revealed without application of the PDES method
[24,33]. In addition to historical analysis, a contrast of transitional
probabilities between exposed and non-exposed youth will provide
data for assessing tobacco control programs. For example, data from
the NSDUH on exposure to several types of educational programs
[34,35] can be used for such purpose.
When transitional probabilities are compared over time or across
interventions, information can also be derived to assess: (1) tobacco
control effort on specific steps of smoking behavior progression (e.g.,
from never-smokers to smoker and further to ex-smokers); (2) the
effect in a specific smoking progression step (e.g. increasing quitter or
reducing experimenters) in reducing the total number of smokers; (3)
the progression steps that are sensitive to change; and (4) the amount
of changes needed in a transition step to achieve a pre-determined
tobacco control objective. This type of information is useful for tobacco
control planning and program strategy optimization [15,36,37].
Despite the strengths, caution is suggested when the PDES method
is used when sudden and substantial changes in population size
smoking behavior in the survey year. In addition, we recommend using
single-year age-group for analysis so that the stability assumption of the
PDES method will not be violated.
