models of ischaemic stroke:
A systematic review and meta-analysis
Jeroen C de Jonge, Justin Wallet and H. Bart van der Worp
Abstract
Background: Subfebrile temperatures and fever in the first days after stroke are associated with a greater risk of a
poor outcome. If this relation is causal, prevention of hyperthermia may improve outcome. Causality can be tested in
animal models. We therefore assessed the effects of hyperthermia on outcomes in animal models of ischaemic stroke
and explored under which conditions prevention of hyperthermia could be most effective.
Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from animal experiments testing the effect of
spontaneous or induced hyperthermia on outcome after focal cerebral ischaemia. Our primary outcome measure was
infarct size. Normalised mean differences were combined using the random effects model and stratified meta-analysis
was used to explore the impact of study characteristics.
Results: We included 19 publications, reporting on 49 comparisons involving 603 animals. Overall, hyperthermia
increased infarct size by 43.4% (95% confidence interval, 29.8­56.9%) and worsened neurobehavioral outcomes by
48.5% (17.2­79.8%). The increase in infarct size was larger with higher temperatures. Hyperthermia was most harmful if
present for more than 2 h and when started at the time of artery occlusion rather than later.
Conclusion: Hyperthermia substantially increased infarct size in animal models of ischaemic stroke, suggesting that the
relation between fever and poor outcome observed in patients is at least in part causal. These data provide support to
trials testing the effect of the prevention of fever with antipyretic drugs in patients with acute stroke.

Introduction
In the first days after stroke, one fourth to half of the
patients develop subfebrile temperatures or fever.1­4
Clinical studies have shown that an elevated body tem-
perature early after stroke is associated with an
increased infarct volume and a greater risk of a poor
clinical outcome.1­9 In a meta-analysis of these studies,
hyperthermia in the first 24 h after stroke was associ-
ated with a twofold increase in short-term mortality.10
Despite the suggested negative effects of hyperthermia,
a phase III clinical trial on the prevention of hyperther-
mia with high-dose paracetamol in patients with
acute stroke failed to demonstrate improvements in
functional outcome or survival.11 However, this trial
was underpowered to detect a small but clinically rele-
vant benefit, and it has remained uncertain whether the
relation between an elevated body temperature early
after stroke and poor outcome is causal.
Animal models allow us to carefully study the effects
of changes in physiological variables in a controlled
setting and they are therefore suitable to assess the
causality between hyperthermia and poor outcome
after stroke. In addition, it is possible to identify

the conditions under which hyperthermia is most harm-
ful, such as different levels, durations, and temporal
patterns of hyperthermia. Knowledge of these factors
might provide further insights in which patients pre-
vention or treatment of hyperthermia could be most
beneficial, which could be used to guide the design of
clinical trials in patients with ischaemic stroke.
Therefore, we performed a systematic review and
meta-analysis to assess the effects of hyperthermia in
animal models of ischaemic stroke.
Methods
Search strategy and study inclusion
We performed a systematic literature search in
Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to July
2017 for synonyms of ischaemic stroke, hyperthermia,
and animal experiments (see Appendix 1 for the exact
search strategy). After removing duplicates, two
authors independently screened titles and abstracts
for relevance and, where appropriate, evaluated full-
text versions of the selected articles for eligibility.
Any discrepancy was resolved by consensus discussion.
We included articles if (1) ischaemic stroke was mod-
elled in an animal by means of a cerebral artery occlu-
sion; (2) hyperthermia was compared to controlled
normothermia; and (3) at least one of the following
outcomes was assessed: infarct size, cerebral oedema,
neurobehavioral outcome, or mortality. Both studies
which assessed induced hyperthermia (by means of
internal or external heating) or spontaneous hyperther-
mia (due to the surgical procedure or the occurrence of
cerebral ischaemia) were included. Only studies assess-
ing intra- or post-ischaemic hyperthermia were consid-
ered; studies which assessed the effect of hyperthermia
before the onset of ischemia alone were excluded.
Studies were also excluded if animal models of fore-
brain or global ischemia were used and if the data
were presented in a way not suitable for meta-analysis.
Data-extraction and outcome assessment
The following data were, if available, extracted from
the included studies: author, year of publication, jour-
nal, country, language, title; species, strain, sex, weight,
age and number of animals used; excluded animals and
reasons of exclusion; type of anaesthetic; method of
ischaemia induction, duration of ischaemia; method
and duration of temperature monitoring; induced or
spontaneous hyperthermia; time, duration, and
method of hyperthermia induction; level of hyperther-
mia; definition of normothermia, method of maintain-
ing normothermia; time of animal sacrifice; infarct size,
functional outcome, mortality, and cerebral oedema,
method of assessment of the outcomes; administration
of additional medication or therapies; the ten points of
the CAMARADES quality checklist ­ see below.
Study quality was assessed according to the
CAMARADES quality checklist with 10 points in
total: (1) peer-reviewed publication; (2) statement of
control of temperature; (3) use of animals with
co-morbidities; (4) use of anaesthetic without promi-
nent intrinsic neuroprotective abilities; (5) reporting
of sample size calculation; (6) randomisation of treat-
ment allocation; (7) concealment of treatment alloca-
tion; (8) blinded assessment of outcome; (9) statement
of compliance with animal welfare regulations; and (10)
statement of possible conflicts of interest.12
The number of animals and the mean outcome and
its standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) were
extracted for each intervention and control group.
In the case if data were only presented graphically,
explicit values were requested from the authors. If
unavailable, values were estimated by measurement
from the graphs. Also, in cases where data required
for meta-analysis were not available from abstracts or
publications, they were requested from the authors.
Statistical analysis
Normalised mean difference was used as the effect size.
The effect size, SE, and 95% confidence interval (95%)
were calculated for each comparison. In case of serial
infarct sizes or neurobehavioral outcomes in the same
group of animals, the effect size of the last observation
was used for meta-analysis. If one normothermia group
was compared to multiple hyperthermia groups, the
amount of animals in the normothermia group was
divided by the amount of hyperthermic groups. By
means of the inverse variance method, weighted effect
sizes were calculated for each comparison, with greater
weight for more precise studies with smaller standard
errors. All effect sizes were pooled by means of the
random effects model instead of the fixed effects
model, because of anticipated heterogeneity between
studies. The amount of heterogeneity between studies
was estimated by means of I2 and Cochran's Q.13,14
A stratified analysis was performed for the following
pre-specified study characteristics to assess their impact
on the overall effect size: level of hyperthermia, dura-
tion of hyperthermia, start of induction of hyperther-
mia in relation to the onset of ischaemia, method of
ischaemia induction, duration of ischaemia, strain, and
sex; and study quality items, focusing on randomisa-
tion and blinding. Significance was assessed by Chi-
square statistic of the residual heterogeneity with nÀ1
degrees of freedom (df). To allow for multiple compar-
isons, we adjusted our significance level using
Bonferroni correction to a critical value of p < 0.004

bias was assessed by funnel plotting and with the
Egger regression method.15
Results
Of 5363 screened articles, 19 were included in the meta-
analysis (Figure 1), reporting on 49 comparisons
involving 603 animals.16­34 Data for infarct size were
reported in 36 comparisons (572 animals), for neuro-
behavioral score in 20 comparisons (150 animals), and
for cerebral oedema in 5 comparisons (73 animals).
Study characteristics
All experiments involved male rats. Four studies assessed
the effect of spontaneous hyperthermia after focal
ischaemia 16,21,28,29 and 15 studies assessed the effect of
controlled induced hyperthermia. Of these 15 studies,
hyperthermia was induced before the onset of ischaemia
in three,17­19 during ischaemia in nine23,25­27,30­34 and
after the onset of ischemia in six.16,18,20,24,28,29 Body
temperatures during the anaesthesia and the surgical
procedure were measured and controlled in 17 out
of the 19 studies. Monitoring of temperature during
the experiment occurred by measuring the temperature
in the rectum (n ¼ 11),16,18,19,21­23,25,28,29,33,34
brain (n ¼ 5),17,18,20,24,26,27 or peri-cranial muscles
(n ¼ 2).31,32 The median temperature during hyperther-
mia was 39.0C (range, 38­40.0C). The median time of
start of hyperthermia was 0 min, i.e. at the onset of
ischaemia (range: À60 to 1500 min). The median
duration of induced hyperthermia was 120 min
(range: 30­270 min) and the median time to infarct
size measurement 48 h (range: 1.5­169.5 h), with no
studies performing temperature measurements between
these two moments. By contrast, three of the four stud-
ies which assessed the effects of a spontaneous rise in
body temperature after focal ischaemia provided infor-
mation on body temperature until animal sacrifice
(median 48 h). In addition, none of these four
studies reported on the occurrence of infections as a
potential cause of the `spontaneous' increase in body
temperature.
Effect of hyperthermia on outcomes
Hyperthermia increased infarct size by 43.4% (95% CI,
29.8% to 56.9%; Figure 2(a)). There was considerable
heterogeneity in the estimates of efficacy between the
studies (I2 ¼ 88.7%; Cochran's Q ¼ 291.7; df ¼ 33;
P < 10À43). Neurobehavioral scores worsened by
48.5% (95% CI, 17.2 to 79.8%) in the presence of
hyperthermia (Figure 3). In the seven studies which
reported neurobehavioral outcomes, there was consid-
erable heterogeneity (I2 ¼ 84.0%; Cochran's Q ¼ 56.1;
df ¼ 9; P ¼ 0.007). Four studies reported on the effect
of hyperthermia on cerebral oedema after ischaemia,
expressed as the increase of ipsilateral hemisphere
volume in relation to the unaffected contralateral hemi-
sphere. Pooled results showed an increase of 64.2%
(95% CI, 15.8 to 112.6%), with significant heterogene-
ity between studies (I2 ¼ 85.3%; Cochran's Q ¼ 27.2;

with normothermia (7/110 vs. 44/152; P < 0.001).

P ¼ 0.010; Figure 2(b)). Compared to rats with normo-
thermia, hyperthermia in the ranges of 38.0­38.9C,
39­39.9C, and >40.0C resulted in an increase
in infarct size of 34.3% (5.5­63.1%), 62.8% (45.4­
80.2%) and 159.1% (14.8­303.4%), respectively.
Stratifying outcomes by duration or timing of hyper-
thermia, or by the timing of the outcome assessment
explained a significant proportion of heterogeneity
(Figure 4(a) and (b)). Infarct sizes were largest in rats
in which hyperthermia was maintained for more than
120 min, if hyperthermia was started before MCA
occlusion, or if outcome was assessed later than 48 h
after the onset of ischaemia. Hyperthermia also had a
slightly larger effect on infarct size in models of tem-
porary MCA occlusion as compared with perma-
nent occlusion.
Study quality and outcomes
The median score on the CAMARADES checklist was
4 out of a possible 10 (interquartile range [IQR] ¼ 3­5).
Randomisation and blinding were reported in just six
and seven of the 19 studies, respectively. Stratifying the
data according to blinding or randomisation revealed
no significant differences in the effects on infarct size.
None of the included studies reported on a sample
size calculation. The CAMARADES score explained
a significant proportion of the observed heterogeneity
(p < 0.001). However, there was no clear linear relation-
ship between lower scores on the CAMARADES qual-
ity checklist and infarct size (R2 ¼ 0.0037, p ¼ 0.92).
Visual inspection of the funnel plot (Figure 5(a))
showed asymmetry with greater effect sizes in more
imprecise studies, suggesting publication bias. This was
supported by Egger regression (Figure 5(b)).
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the pres-
ence of hyperthermia in animals with focal cerebral
ischaemia increased infarct size and worsened neuro-
behavioral scores by 43.4% and 48.5%, respectively.
Infarct size increased with each degree Celsius increase
in body temperature. Hyperthermia was most harmful
with longer durations of hyperthermia, in models of
temporary ischemia, and if rats were hyperthermic
during vessel occlusion rather than if hyperthermia
was initiated after vessel occlusion. These findings
strongly suggest that the relationship between hyper-
thermia and worse outcome in stroke patients is at
least partially causal, and warrants further trials on
the prevention of fever in patients with acute stroke.
In several prospective clinical studies, summarised
in three meta-analyses, the presence of hyperthermia
in the first days after stroke has been associated with
a worse functional outcome and an increased risk of
death.10,35,36 Prevention of hyperthermia with high-
dose paracetamol is safe and simple,37,38 but has so
far not convincingly improved outcomes in randomised
trials in patients with acute stroke,11,38 which may be
explained by several factors. In the phase III
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) In Stroke (PAIS) trial,
the majority of patients had a mild stroke (median
NIHSS, 6). Since both the risk of hyperthermia and
the risk of a poor outcome are larger in patients with
a more severe deficit,8 the trials missed the opportunity
to assess the effects of fever prevention in patients with
the largest chance of benefit.11,38 Moreover, all trials
were underpowered to detect a small but clinically rel-
evant benefit of fever prevention. In a post-hoc analysis
of PAIS, preventive treatment with acetaminophen in

patients with a baseline temperature of 37 to 39C did
result in an improvement in functional outcome (OR
1.43; 95% CI, 1.02­1.97). This finding is consistent
with ours, and both findings provide support to the
hypothesis that prevention or treatment of hyperthermia
in these patients improves functional outcome. This
hypothesis is currently tested in the phase III trial
PRECIOUS: PREvention of Complications to Improve
OUtcome in elderly patients with acute Stroke. This trial
assesses whether prevention of aspiration, infections, or
fever with metoclopramide, ceftriaxone, paracetamol, or
any combination of these in elderly patients with a mod-
erately severe to severe acute stroke is more effective at
improving functional outcome than current clinical prac-
tice of waiting until these complications are manifest
before initiating treatment.39
The results of this meta-analysis do not provide
extensive information on the relationship between the
timing of hyperthermia and outcome in animals.
Almost all studies induced hyperthermia within the
first hours after MCA occlusion, and maintained
higher temperatures for a median of just 2 h. The
single study that delayed the induction of hyperthermia
to 24 h after the onset of ischaemia demonstrated a
detrimental effect of an increase in body temperature
to 40C, but not of an increase to 39C.20
Three of the four studies that assessed the effects of
the spontaneous increase in body temperature after
focal ischaemia performed temperature measurements
until animal sacrifice. Temperatures generally remained
elevated during the first 24 h, with apparent normal-
isation after 48 h.21,28,29 In clinical studies, elevated
body temperatures have been observed in almost
10% of the patients after one week, and the relation
between hyperthermia and poor outcome or larger
infarct size persisted for up to one week.8,9
There are several proposed mechanisms by which
hyperthermia enlarges infarct size, including enhanced
neurotoxic neurotransmitter release,40,41 blood-brain
barrier breakdown,42 increased radical production,43
increased metabolism44 and increased inflammation.45
In our meta-analysis, we found a modest difference in
the increase in infarct size between temporary ischemia
and permanent ischemia. In rats with temporary ische-
mia, hyperthermia could increase the infarct core
before revascularisation or reduce the potential for
recovery of penumbral tissue despite adequate reperfu-
sion. This has also recently been suggested in patients
with ischaemic stroke, in whom fever after successful
mechanical thrombectomy was associated with larger
infarct sizes.46
The current meta-analysis has limitations. There
was considerable heterogeneity between the included
studies and funnel plotting and Egger regression sug-
gested publication bias. For these reasons, the overall
pooled effect size should be interpreted with caution.
Furthermore, no study reported body temperatures in
the period between cessation of induced hyperthermia
and animal sacrifice. Since the median duration of
hyperthermia was 2 h, and the median duration until
sacrifice was 24 h, there is a considerable time window
in which spontaneous hyperthermia could have
occurred in any experimental group. It is not known
whether there were differences in the severity or dura-
tion of spontaneous hyperthermia between these
groups. In addition, in three studies,22,26,28 the reported
mortality rate was not specified for each experimental
arm, or it was not reported if deceased animals were
excluded from infarct size assessment. Therefore, in
these studies, the exact number of remaining animals
in the outcome assessment could not be inferred, and
we had to use the predefined number of animals, which
might be an overestimation. Finally, we limited our

Conclusion
In rats with focal cerebral ischaemia, hyperthermia
increases infarct size and worsens neurobehavioral out-
comes. This provides additional evidence to the assump-
tion that the relation between hyperthermia and poor
outcome in patients with acute stroke is at least in
part causal, and supports the conduct of clinical trials
testing the effects of fever prevention in these patients.
