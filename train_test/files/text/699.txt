The Influence of Insurance Status on Nonurgent
Pediatric Visits to the Emergency Department
CHRISTINA FONG, MB, BS, MPH
Abstract. Objective: To compare the effects of
HMOs with the effects of other types of private health
insurance on nonurgent ED visits in the pediatric
population. Methods: Secondary analysis of the
emergency component of the 1994 National Hospital
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) on pa-
tients aged 15 years or less. Variables of interest in-
cluded urgency of visit, age, sex, race, ethnicity,
method of payment (HMO, private insurance/non-
HMO, and others), and chief complaint. A p-value of
0.01 was used as the threshold for significance to off-
set the effects of increases in variability and signifi-
cance of p-values and narrow confidence intervals.
Results: There were 6,744 observations. The overall
rate of nonurgent ED visits was 58%. The rate of non-
urgent visits for HMO patients was 51%, for private
non-HMO insurance 56%, and for other types of pay-
ment (Medicare, Medicaid, patient paid, no charge,
and other government) 60%. Chief complaints for
nonurgent visits were general symptoms, EENT (ear,
eyes, nose, and throat) symptoms, and dermatologic
symptoms. After multivariate analysis, the odds ratio
for patients with private insurance for a nonurgent
visit compared with HMO patients was 1.27, with a
95% CI = 1.07 to 1.51, after adjusting for age, sex,
and chief complaint. Conclusion: Pediatric patients
with private insurance were more likely to present
for emergency care for nonurgent reasons when com-
pared with HMO patients after adjusting for the
above listed variables. The reasons for this disparity
should be further explored. Key words: nonurgent;

TRADITIONALLY, EDs were developed pri-
marily to provide treatment for patients with
unanticipated life-threatening and urgent condi-
tions. However, the utilization of the ED has in-
creased in both volume and scope over the past ten
years, with a rising percentage of nonurgent
cases.1,2 Nonurgent ED visits can lead to inefficient
utilization of resources, ED case overload, and
overcrowding.3,4 Most nonurgent ED problems
have been shown to be more effectively and effi-
ciently dealt with in a primary care setting.3,4
Nonurgent ED visits seem to be particularly
prevalent in the pediatric population, as evidenced
by a nationwide ED survey of 240 EDs. These re-
searchers found that 70% of all ED visits were non-
urgent.5 Previous studies have demonstrated that
non­managed-care patients have higher rates of
nonurgent ED presentations compared with pa-
tients who required prior physician approval.
MacKoul et al.6 found that Medicaid patients who
presented to the ED were younger and had lower

illness severity scores. In another consumer survey
performed by Chande et al.,7 patients with medical
assistance (i.e., Medicaid) used the ED more for
minor illnesses than did patients with commercial
insurance, despite the fact that almost all patients
identified a primary care provider. One of the main
differences in patient management of HMOs as op-
posed to non-HMO private insurance is gatekeep-
ing. Could this be an effective mechanism for re-
ducing nonurgent ED visits?
Franco et al.8 showed this to be true. They stud-
ied a program (KenPAC) that required 24-hour ac-
cess to a primary care physician with ED gate-
keeping responsibility before and after it was
commenced. They found that nonurgent ED visits
dropped from 41% to 8% (p < 0.00001) before
KenPAC and after KenPAC was instituted, respec-
tively.
However, apart from gatekeeping or prior phy-
sician approval, other factors have been purported
to affect the utilization of the ED by children.
These include difficulties with transportation or
access, parents' work responsibilities, problems
with sibling care, acuity of illness, reduced avail-
ability of alternate health services, parents' per-
ceptions of the child's condition, and insurance
status.9­11
The main objective of this study was to compare
the patterns of ED use of individuals participating
in HMOs with those of individuals having other
types of private health insurance in the pediatric
population. The main hypothesis was that HMO
ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE · July 1999, Volume 6, Number 7 745
patients are less likely to present to the ED for
nonurgent reasons than private health insurance
patients. It is theorized that HMOs have reduced
these unnecessary ED visits by gatekeeping and
the provision of more primary care providers to
their subscribers. This study sought to compare
these two populations assuming that the services
provided by private insurance and HMOs were
similar, with the exception of gatekeeping prac-
tices.
METHODS
Study Design. The National Hospital Ambula-
tory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) 1994 is a na-
tional probability survey conducted by the Division
of Health Care Statistics, CDC.12,13 This cross-sec-
tional study collected data from 418 EDs and 260
outpatient departments of a national sample of
hospitals. The NHAMCS used a four-stage proba-
bility design with clustered samples described as
primary sampling units. The effect of clustered
sampling is to increase the significance of p-values
and narrow confidence intervals. Therefore, the
threshold for significance in the analyses was set
at p = 0.01.14 The retrospective nature of this study
using an existing database made it exempt from
institutional review board review.
Study Protocol. Data collection was carried out
over a four-week reporting period during which a
trained member of the ED staff completed a pa-
tient record form. Patient visit data were recorded
for each sample visit using either a prospective or
a retrospective data collection method. In the pro-
spective approach, the hospital sampled patient
visits and then completed the patient record forms
(largely through observation) during or shortly af-
ter the sample visit. In the retrospective approach,
hospital staff sampled visits after the patients
were seen and then completed patient record forms
through medical record abstraction.15
Among the variables collected on the form are
age, race, sex, and ethnicity of the patient, reason
for the visit, physician's diagnosis, cause of injury,
surgical procedures, medication therapy, expected
source of payment, diagnostic/screening services,
urgency of the visit, providers seen during the
visit, and disposition of the visit. To maintain ac-
curacy of the measure, the survey was tested by
reinterviewing a selected subsample over the sub-
sequent one and two years.
Modifications to the survey were carried out
throughout the sampling frame of ten years to ad-
just for secular changes in the domains measured.
Furthermore, internal validity checks included
NHAMCS field representative training, hospital
induction courses, periodic supervised patient
sampling, editing completed forms, and retrieving
missing data. Missing data were imputed as de-
scribed by Massey.16
Data were obtained from the NHAMCS 1994
public datafile available from the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, National Center
for Health Statistics 1994 computer file, 2nd re-
lease. During the 12-month period from January
to December 1994, an estimated 93.4 million visits
were made to hospital EDs of nonfederal, short-
stay, or general hospitals in the United States.
Children under 15 years of age made up one fourth
of all ED visits. The NHAMCS surveyed 26,547 ED
patient visits. This analysis included those pa-
tients aged 15 years or less (n = 6,771) comprising
26% of the total sample of 26,547 ED visits by pa-
tients of all ages.
Measures. The variables extracted from the sur-
vey datafile included:
· Urgency of the ED presentation (urgent vs non-
urgent vs emergent): Nonurgent visits were de-
fined as visits for ``patients who do not require at-
tention immediately or within a few hours.''
· Patient characteristics: age (patients of 15 years
or less), sex, race, and ethnicity.
· Method of payment: HMO, private insurance
(non-HMO), and other (which comprised Medicare,
Medicaid, other government insurance, no pay-
ment, self-payment, and unspecified). We were un-
able to determine what percentage of HMOs pri-
marily served Medicaid patients; however, the
survey was performed at a time where Medicaid
managed care systems were less prevalent than it
is now.
· Primary reason for presentation as categorized
by symptom module: general symptoms (refers to
constitutional symptoms such as chills, fever, fa-
tigue, and weight loss); psychiatric symptoms; and
symptoms pertaining to the nervous, cardiovascu-
lar, eye, ear, nose, and throat (EENT), respiratory,
digestive, genitourinary, dermatologic, or muscu-
loskeletal systems.
Data Analysis. The sample weights provided in
the datafile were used so that the descriptive sta-
tistics and analyses reflected a sample of children
aged 15 years or less representative of similarly
aged children in the United States. This was done
to compensate for the oversampling of the aged,
Hispanics, blacks, and the lower socioeconomic
strata of the NHAMCS.10
All variables of interest were kept as discrete
variables, except for age, which was left as a con-
tinuous variable. In the analysis of the raw data,
it was found that there were some patients who
overlapped into both HMO and private insurance
groups. Because the objective of the study was to
specifically compare HMOs with other forms of pri-
vate insurances, mixed-model HMOs were coded
under the HMO group.

Weighted logistic regression was used to com-
pute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) for each variable of interest. The pri-
mary outcome variable was the urgency status of
the ED visit (urgent/nonurgent). A stepwise selec-
tion procedure was used to identify significant pre-
dictors of nonurgent visits in addition to type of
insurance to construct the most parsimonious
model. Variables that were not retained in the final
model by stepwise selection were later examined
as potential confounders. This was done by includ-
ing each variable in the final model to determine
whether the parameter estimates of the variable of
interest (HMO patients) were changed by more
than 10%. As noted above, variables were retained
in the final model that was significant at the 0.01
level. The SAS statistical software package was
used for all analyses. Continuous data are ex-
pressed as mean  standard deviation.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
There were 6,744 weighted observations in the
data set for children aged 15 years or less. There
were 3,894 nonurgent visits made to the ED,
where the overall rate was 58%. The mean age of
presentation for nonurgent visits was 5.3  4.8
years and for urgent visits, 5.9  5.0 years. Forty-
eight percent of nonurgent visits were made by fe-
males and 52% by males. In the urgent ED visit
group, 43% were females and 57% were males. The
distributions of race and ethnicity were similar for
nonurgent and urgent visits.
Of the 3,894 nonurgent visits, 10% were HMO-
insured patients, 30% had private insurance, and
60% received other types of payment. In contrast,
12% of the 2,850 urgent visits were patients with
HMOs, 33% had non-HMO private insurance, and
55% had other forms of payment.
Insurance types of patients with nonurgent vis-
its are outlined in Table 2. The rate of nonurgent
visits in patients with HMOs was 51%. This rate
was marginally higher in the non-HMO private in-
surance patients, who had a nonurgent ED visit
rate of 56%, and highest in the other payment
group, which was 60%.
Primary complaint for presentation according
to symptom is detailed in Table 3. Seventy percent
of all visits were coded by symptoms of different
systems. Of these, the most common complaints of
nonurgent visits were general symptoms, EENT
symptoms, and dermatologic symptoms.
The multivariate analysis (Table 4) demon-
strated the rates of nonurgent visits, and crude
and adjusted ORs of significant variables identified
by logistic regression. Patients with HMOs were
used as the reference group. Compared with pa-
tients who had HMO insurance, patients who had
private non-HMO insurance had a crude OR = 1.20
with a 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.42; however, after con-
trolling for age, sex, and chief complaints, the ad-
justed OR increased to 1.27 with a 95% CI = 1.07
to 1.51.
Patients presenting with general symptoms,
EENT symptoms, and dermatologic symptoms be-
came stronger predictors of nonurgent visits after
adjusting for insurance status, age, and sex. As

summarized in Table 4, patients presenting with
general symptoms had a 32% increase in likelihood
of presenting to the ED nonurgently, or they had
an adjusted OR = 1.32 (95% CI = 1.15 to 1.50).
Patients presenting with EENT symptoms had an
adjusted OR = 2.14 (95% CI = 1.72 to 2.65); and
patients presenting with dermatologic symptoms
had an adjusted OR = 2.45 (95% CI = 1.85 to 3.23).
DISCUSSION
The data in this study suggest that patients with
private non-HMO insurance are 27% more likely
to present to the ED for nonurgent problems than
patients with HMOs. Therefore, having HMO in-
surance appears to be preventive of nonurgent
visits.
The private non-HMO insurance odds ratio was
initially predictive of nonurgent visits, with an OR
of 1.20. After controlling for age, sex, and general,
EENT, and dermatologic symptoms, the OR in-
creased to 1.27. This change may be due to the
confounding effects of the primary complaints that
are predictive of nonurgent visits. General symp-
toms, dermatologic problems, and EENT symp-
toms were found to be statistically significant uni-
variate predictors of nonurgent visits (Table 3). In
a subgroup analysis of the three methods of pay-
ment, the private non-HMO patients had a lower
rate of the primary complaints that were corre-
lated with nonurgent visits (Table 5). Therefore, by
controlling for these and other potential variables
that might affect the outcome of the primary var-
iable (nonurgent visits) by logistic regression, we
were able to calculate an OR that reflected a more
accurate effect of insurance status on nonurgent
visits.
Another potential confounder, socioeconomic
status, which was not available in the data set, is
likely to be related to the type of insurance.11 To
prevent socioeconomic status from confounding the
OR for insurance type, government health insur-
ance and Medicaid were not included in the private
insurance group because these patients may be of
a lower socioeconomic status. It was assumed that
the socioeconomic statuses of patients with HMOs
and private insurance were similar.
The effect of the type of insurance on nonurgent
ED visits may be due not only to gatekeeping but
also to other potential factors such as access to
health care and the presence of a regular physi-
cian. It may be that patients with HMOs have bet-
ter access to a regular primary care physician,
which would be another reason for a lower rate of
nonurgent visit to the ED. Smith and McNamara11
demonstrated that a substantial proportion of chil-
dren seen in their ED for minor illness had no des-
ignated pediatric provider or had a provider to
whom access was difficult.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE QUESTIONS
One of the major limitations of this study is that
the rate of actual ``gatekeeping'' was not measured.
It is unknown how many HMO patients who were
seen in the ED actually had prior contact with
their HMOs. Similarly, we do not know how many
patients who actually communicated with their
HMOs appropriately were advised to not present
to the ED. Therefore, by not capturing the patients
in both the HMO and privately insured groups who
748 INSURANCE STATUS Fong · INSURANCE STATUS AND PEDIATRIC ED VISITS
did not present to the ED for nonurgent problems,
we are not able to estimate the true rates of non-
urgent ED visits. In future studies, this factor
could be explored by obtaining from HMOs how
many patients communicated with their gatekeep-
ers prior to their ED presentation and by parental
interview to determine what factors led to the ED
visit.
Another limitation of this study is that the time
of presentation of these nonurgent visits was not
available. The inclusion of this missing factor in
the analysis could demonstrate entirely different
ED utilization patterns in the different groups of
patients. A nonurgent ED visit may be entirely ap-
propriate at a time when no other alternate health
care is available.
As mentioned under statistical analysis, we at-
tempted to avoid excluding patients with private
insurance and HMOs as coding them in the HMO
group. However, we were unable to identify any
Medicaid managed care patients that may have
HMOs (since the insurance status was classified as
Medicaid only). This missing variable may have
underestimated the rate of nonurgent ED visits in
the HMO group if patients with Medicaid and
HMOs who presented with nonurgent problems
were excluded from the HMO group. This would
potentially bias the result, favoring HMOs as bet-
ter than private non-HMO insurers in preventing
nonurgent visits to the ED.
The definition of ``nonurgency'' used in the
NHAMCS does not directly address visits for
symptoms that would cause a ``prudent layperson''
to seek emergency care but for which it was later
deemed by the ED staff to be unnecessary. For the
purposes of the survey, nonurgent visits were de-
fined as visits for ``patients who do not require
attention immediately or within a few hours.'' Such
patients won't be considered urgent or appropriate
based on the parent's definition/perception,
whereas the NHAMCS respondents may have de-
termined the level of urgency based on the pa-
tient's symptoms, diagnostic tests, the physician's
diagnosis, or the treatment provided. Further-
more, a nonurgent problem may be entirely appro-
priate if other alternatives are unavailable. In a
survey of 268 ED patients considered to be non-
urgent by the triage nurse in an urban ED, Gill
and Riley17 found that 82% of patients rated their
problems as urgent and appropriate. It is hoped
that prospective studies will define the difference
between nonurgent and inappropriate presenta-
tions.
Finally, the objectives of the NHAMCS data-
base were to produce descriptive statistics about
the health and health-related parameters of the
civilian noninstitutionalized population of the
United States. One of their basic variables of in-
terest is the utilization of the ED. Therefore, the
NHAMCS definition of nonurgent may not be ideal
for our study hypothesis. However, this survey is
currently the closest measure for evaluating the
incidence of nonurgent visits.
CONCLUSION
Despite its limitations, this study supports the hy-
pothesis that patients with HMOs present to the
ED less often with nonurgent complaints than do
those with other private health insurance. The
cause of this effect remains to be investigated in
future prospective studies.
