Abstract
BURDETTE, HILLARY L., THOMAS A. WADDEN,
AND ROBERT C. WHITAKER. Neighborhood safety,
collective efficacy, and obesity in women with young
children. Obesity. 2006;14:518­525.
Objective: To test the hypothesis that mothers of young
children would have a higher prevalence of obesity if they
lived in neighborhoods that they perceived as unsafe or as
having a low level of collective efficacy.
Research Methods and Procedures: Using data from the
Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a cross-sec-
tional analysis was conducted of 2445 women living in 20
large (population  200,000) U.S. cities. BMI was mea-
sured on 72% and self-reported on 28%. Perception of
neighborhood safety was assessed with the Neighborhood
Environment for Children Rating Scales. The collective
efficacy measure was adapted from the Project on Human
Development in Chicago Neighborhoods.
Results: Thirty percent of the women were married, 38% lived
below the U.S. poverty threshold, and 66% reported no edu-
cation beyond high school. Approximately one-half of the
women were non-Hispanic black, and one-fourth were His-
panic (any race). After adjustment for sociodemographic fac-
tors (household income, education, race/ethnicity, age, and
marital status), smoking, depression, and television time, the
prevalence of obesity (BMI  30 kg/m2) increased across
tertiles of neighborhood safety from safest to least safe (37%
vs. 41% vs. 46%, p  0.004) but did not differ across tertiles
of collective efficacy from highest to lowest (41% vs. 40% vs.
42%, p  0.67).
Discussion: In a national sample of women with young
children, obesity was more prevalent among those who
perceived their neighborhoods to be unsafe.
Key words: safety, residence characteristics, environ-
ment, mothers, crime
Introduction
The characteristics of neighborhoods can influence how
and where people spend their time (1). For example, certain
neighborhood characteristics may lead people to spend less
time outdoors. More indoor time may contribute to obesity
by decreasing physical activity and by increasing sedentary
behaviors and food intake.
People's perception of social disorder and of collective
efficacy in their neighborhood may influence how much
time they spend outdoors. Social disorder is a measure of
neighborhood safety that describes potentially threatening
neighborhood conditions and behaviors such as the presence
of drug dealing, loitering, and public intoxication (2,3).
Such neighborhood activities may lead people to remain in
their homes, thereby constraining their outdoor activity and
reducing daily energy expenditure.
Collective efficacy is a measure of people's perception of
closeness or connection with their neighbors (social cohe-
sion and trust) and the capacity of neighbors to intervene on
behalf of their community to reach common goals (informal
social control) (4). Distrust and lack of collective accom-
plishment are associated with violence and victimization,
even after taking into account the economic and demo-
graphic characteristics of residents (4). Therefore, low lev-
els of perceived collective efficacy, like low levels of per-
ceived neighborhood safety, might be associated with a
tendency for people to remain indoors.
If people do not feel safe in their neighborhoods or
connected to their neighbors, this could also increase levels
of perceived psychological stress. For some, chronic stress
could lead to functional impairment through anxiety or
depressed mood. These emotions could increase social iso-
lation and reduce energy expenditure in routine or leisure-

time activity, especially outdoors. Perceived stress or symp-
toms of depression or anxiety can also increase food intake
in some individuals (5,6).
Despite the hypothesized link between the perceived
level of neighborhood safety and obesity, we are aware of
no studies in adults that have evaluated this association.
Using data collected in 20 U.S. cities, we tested the hypoth-
eses that women with young children who lived in neigh-
borhoods that they perceived as unsafe and as having lower
levels of collective efficacy would have a higher mean BMI
and a higher prevalence of obesity than those who lived in
neighborhoods where these characteristics were perceived
to be more favorable.
Research Methods and Procedures
Study Design and Sample
The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study is a birth
cohort study following 4898 children and their parents. This
report focuses on the mothers. The sample was drawn from
births between 1998 and 2000 in 20 large (population 
200,000) U.S. cities in 15 states at 75 birth hospitals. Be-
cause unmarried mothers were oversampled (3:1) relative to
married mothers (7), 3712 of the women in the study were
unmarried (so-called fragile families) when the baseline
survey was conducted at delivery.
Women were ineligible (5% of sampled births) if their
child was placed for adoption, if they did not speak either
English or Spanish adequately to understand the survey, or
if they were too ill after delivery. Most hospitals did not
allow women 18 years of age to participate. Among
eligible women, 82% of those married and 87% of those
unmarried agreed to participate. The institutional review
boards at all birth hospitals, as well as those at Princeton and
Columbia Universities, approved the data collection proce-
dures. All participants gave informed written consent.
Approximately 3 years after delivery, 2620 women
(53%) participated in an in-home survey during which
height and weight measurements were obtained and mothers
responded to questions about their neighborhood. The ra-
cial/ethnic composition of the mothers was different among
those who were followed-up at 3 years and those who were
not (non-Hispanic white, 20% vs. 23%; non-Hispanic black,
52% vs. 43%; Hispanic, 25% vs. 29%; other race/ethnicity,
3% vs. 5%; p  0.001 by overall 2 test). However, there
were no significant differences in baseline income, marital
status, age, or education.
Measures
BMI. BMI (kilograms per meter squared) was calculated
from the women's measured or self-reported heights and
weights. In two of the cities, all heights were reported. In the
other 18 cities, heights were measured, and those who
refused were asked to report their height. All subjects were
weighed unless they were pregnant, exceeded the scale limit
of 140 kg, or refused. In each of these situations, the subject
was asked to report her current weight (or her prepregnant
weight if she was pregnant).
The analytic sample included the 2445 (93%) women
with BMI data. Of these, a total of 675 (28%) had reported,
rather than measured, height or weight; 180 were pregnant,
385 reported height, 63 reported weight, and 47 reported
both.
Neighborhood Safety/Social Disorder. Perception of
neighborhood safety was assessed using the Neighborhood
Environment for Children Rating Scales (8). This eight-item
scale, designed to measure social disorder, asked the women
how often they saw events in their neighborhoods such as
loitering adults, gang activity, drunks or drug dealers hang-
ing around, and disorderly or misbehaving groups of youths
or adults.
The four response options (never, rarely, sometimes, and
frequently) were assigned the values 1 through 4, respec-
tively. Internal reliability of the eight items, as measured by
Cronbach , was 0.91. The scale score was computed as the
mean value of the responses for all women who completed
at least six of the eight items. The scale scores ranged from
1 to 4, with lower scores indicating a higher level of
perceived safety. Because the scale scores were not nor-
mally distributed, they were divided into tertiles. The safest
tertile (referred to as high safety) included all women with
a score equal to 1.0 (i.e., answering never to all items). The
medium safety tertile scores ranged from 1.1 to 2.0, and the
least safe tertile (referred to as low safety) included all
women with a score  2.0.
Collective Efficacy. The measure of collective efficacy
was adapted from the 1995 Community Survey of the
Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
(4). This construct consisted of two components: social
cohesion and trust, the level of trust and attachment among
neighbors; and informal social control, a belief in the ca-
pacity of neighborhood residents to intervene to help the
community reach collective goals. Each component con-
sisted of five items. For the social cohesion and trust com-
ponent, the women recorded their level of agreement to
statements about their neighbors, such as, "People in this
neighborhood can be trusted." The five response options
were strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor
disagree, somewhat disagree, and strongly disagree. The
informal social control construct consisted of questions
about how likely neighbors were to intervene in certain
situations, such as if a fight broke out in front of their house
or if children were skipping school. The five response
options were very likely, somewhat likely, neither likely nor
unlikely, somewhat unlikely, and very unlikely.
The response options for each of the 10 items, ranging
from strongly agree to strongly disagree (social cohesion
and trust) and very likely to very unlikely (social control),
Neighborhood Safety and Maternal Obesity, Burdette, Wadden, and Whitaker

were assigned the values 1 to 5. Internal reliability of the 10
items, as measured by Cronbach , was 0.85. A collective
efficacy score was computed for all mothers who completed
at least four of the five items for each of the two compo-
nents (i.e., at least eight of the 10 total items) by averaging
the responses to the completed items. The scale scores
ranged from 1 to 5, with a higher number indicating a lower
level of collective efficacy. These scores were divided into
tertiles to facilitate the interpretation of results. Women in
the low-efficacy tertile were those who rated their neigh-
borhoods as having the least collective efficacy (highest
scale score), and women in the high efficacy tertile were
those who rated their neighborhood as having the most
collective efficacy (lowest scale scores).
Covariates. Income was calculated as a ratio of house-
hold income divided by the income at the federal poverty
threshold for a given household size in the year of reporting
(see http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/poverty.shtml). Other so-
ciodemographic covariates included education, race/ethnic-
ity, and current marital status.
Smoking status (yes/no variable) and 12-month history of
a major depressive episode [yes/no variable computed from
the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short
Form, version 1.0 (World Health Organization) (9­11)]
were obtained at 3 years. These two conditions are poten-
tially related to both the exposure (neighborhood context)
(12,13) and the outcome (obesity) (14,15). Women also
reported the number of hours (0 to 24) the television (TV)1
was on in the house each day. This variable served as a
proxy for TV viewing.
Data Analysis
Obesity was defined as having a BMI  30 kg/m2.
Across the three tertiles of neighborhood safety and collec-
tive efficacy, we compared the mean BMI using one-way
ANOVA, and we compared the prevalence of obesity using
2 tests. We then used General Linear Models to compare
mean BMI and percentage obese across these tertiles after
adjusting for covariates.
Results
The mean age of the women was 27.6 (6.0) years.
Thirty percent were married, 38% lived in households re-
porting income below the federal poverty threshold (in-
come-to-poverty ratio  1.00), and 66% reported no edu-
cation beyond high school (Table 1). Approximately one-
half the women were non-Hispanic black, and one-fourth
were Hispanic (any race).
The mean BMI was 29.4  7.5 kg/m2. Forty-one percent
had a BMI 30 kg/m2, and 9% had a BMI  40 kg/m2. The
women were more likely to be obese and to have higher
BMI if they were less educated, unmarried, had lower
income, or were Hispanic or non-Hispanic black (Table 1).
Women who reported symptoms in the prior 12 months
consistent with a major depressive episode had higher mean
BMI and were more likely to be obese.
Women who were more educated, married, non-Hispanic
white, older, and had higher income were more likely to
perceive their neighborhoods as being safer and as having
more collective efficacy (Table 2). Women with a depres-
sive episode were more likely to perceive their neighbor-
hoods as less safe and as having lower collective efficacy.
The average amount of time (hours per day) the TV was on
in the house was higher in obese women (8.4 vs. 9.1; p 
0.009) and was higher when neighborhoods were perceived
as being less safe (low-safety to high-safety tertile, 10.3,
8.1, 7.1; p  0.001) and as having lower collective efficacy
(low-efficacy to high-efficacy tertile, 9.5, 8.8, 7.7; p 
0.001).
Neighborhood Safety
In bivariate analysis, women had higher mean BMI and
a higher prevalence of obesity as the level of perceived
neighborhood safety decreased (Table 3). After adjusting
for sociodemographic factors (household income, educa-
tion, race/ethnicity, age, and relationship status as the cat-
egorical variables listed in Table 1), obesity prevalence
and mean BMI were still significantly associated with
neighborhood safety. Across the three tertiles, from the
high-safety to the low-safety tertile, the mean BMI went
from 29  0.28 to 29  0.26 to 30  0.27 kg/m2 (p 
0.001), and the prevalence of obesity went from 37% to
41% to 46% (p  0.007). In these multivariate models, the
further addition of three variables (smoking, depression,
and number of hours per day the TV was on) had minimal
impact on the relationship between BMI or obesity and
safety (adjusted model in Table 3). After adjustment for
all covariates, the prevalence of obesity was 9 percentage
points higher among women in the least safe tertile com-
pared with those in the safest tertile. Using an obesity
cut-off point of BMI  40 kg/m2, obesity prevalence still
increased significantly from the high-safety to the low-
safety tertile (7%, 8%, 11%; p  0.04) after adjustment for
all covariates.
Collective Efficacy
In bivariate analysis, women who perceived lower
levels of collective efficacy had higher mean BMI and also
tended to have a higher prevalence of obesity (Table 3).
However, after adjusting for all covariates, there was no
clear relationship between collective efficacy and either
mean BMI or obesity prevalence. Using an obesity cut-off
point of BMI  40 kg/m2, obesity prevalence was not
significantly different from lowest to highest level of col-
lective efficacy (10%, 8%, 8%; p  0.34) after adjusting for
covariates.

Discussion
In this national study of over 2400 women with preschool
children, those who perceived their neighborhoods as safer
had a lower mean BMI and were less likely to be obese.
This was true after controlling for multiple measures of
socioeconomic status that might potentially confound the
relationship between neighborhood safety and obesity.
There was no significant association between collective
efficacy and either BMI or obesity after adjustment for
covariates.
To our knowledge, this is the first study in adults to
examine the relationship between obesity and perceived
neighborhood safety or collective efficacy. Several studies
have explored the relationship between neighborhood safety
and physical activity. In a national telephone survey of 1600
adults, neighborhood safety was shown to be a barrier to

physical activity, particularly in low-income households
(16). In an analysis of data from the 1996 Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System in five states, higher levels of
perceived neighborhood safety were associated with a lower
prevalence of inactivity (17). In qualitative studies, safety
has been reported by minority women to be a barrier to
physical activity (18).
In contrast to these studies, others have shown that safety
and crime are not associated with physical activity levels. In
a cross-sectional study of 1800 U.S. adults, subject report of
high crime in the neighborhood was not significantly related
to physical activity after adjusting for age, sex, race, in-
come, and education (19). In a study of 2900 women 40
years of age and older, neither the perception of high levels
of crime nor lack of safe places to exercise was associated
with leisure-time physical activity (20).
Although obesity was related to our measure of neigh-
borhood safety, it was not related to our measure of collec-
tive efficacy. It is possible that outdoor physical activity is
more influenced by the fear associated with social disorder
than by a sense of low social cohesion and trust in the
neighborhood or a low level of informal social control. In
addition, women who perceived their neighborhoods as
having low collective efficacy may still have had meaning-
ful social connections with individuals outside of their
neighborhood. These connections may have resulted in psy-
chological benefits that offset any psychological distress
associated with the perception of low collective efficacy in
their neighborhood.
From our cross-sectional study, we cannot infer that low
levels of neighborhood safety cause obesity. It is possible,
for example, that obese women may be more inclined to
perceive their neighborhood as unsafe because they are
subjected to higher levels of discrimination (21). We have
no measurement of physical activity to evaluate whether
reduced physical activity mediates the relationship between
safety and obesity. The hours per day that the TV was on in
the household is only a proxy measure for TV viewing time,
which is, in turn, not necessarily correlated with physical
activity levels.
We also had no information on diet. Neighborhoods with
low levels of safety may also have a lower availability of
foods that could reduce the risk of obesity (22,23). How-
ever, we did control for individual-level indicators of race/
ethnicity and social class that may be related to both diet
and neighborhood safety. It is also possible that neighbor-
hood safety affects obesity by other factors, such as psy-
chological stress, that influence both energy intake and
expenditure. Although we had no measure of perceived
stress, chronic stress may contribute to depression, which
was included in our analysis but which did not seem to
mediate the BMI-safety relationship.
Although multiple mechanisms are likely to be involved
in the association between neighborhood safety and obesity,
the one most often proposed involves the effect of safety on
physical activity. Therefore, the lack of data on physical
activity in this study is an important limitation that should
be addressed in future research.

Theoretically, an experiment in which neighborhoods
were randomly assigned to an intervention that improves
safety and/or the perception of safety would be the strong-
est design to test causality. In the Moving to Opportunity
study, low-income families were randomly assigned to re-
ceive housing vouchers that could be used to move to
neighborhoods that varied in the percentage of residents
living in poverty (24). Women who received vouchers to
obtain housing in higher income neighborhoods had a sig-
nificantly lower prevalence of obesity at follow-up. Al-
though the neighborhood safety levels were not measured,
women in the higher income neighborhoods did have
lower levels of anxiety and depression, suggesting the pos-
sibility that psychological stress may be part of a causal
pathway between neighborhood safety and obesity. Adding
measures of safety perception, psychological stress, physi-
cal activity, sedentary time, and dietary intake to experi-
ments or quasi-experiments of neighborhood mobility
would help increase our understanding of the effect of the
neighborhood environment on obesity.
Although the neighborhood context is often mentioned
as an important factor influencing adult physical activity
levels and obesity (25,26), this is the first study, to our
knowledge, to find an association between perceived safety
and BMI. This finding has particular implications for the
obesity epidemic because our study focused on women of
childbearing age who have young preschool children. Many
women were living in low-income households. Not only do
low-income minority women experience higher rates of
obesity (27,28), but many are single mothers who are im-
portant role models and facilitators of their children's ac-
tivity levels. Thus, future studies should not only assess how
perceived safety influences adult physical activity and obe-
sity, but they should also attempt to evaluate what aspects of
perceived neighborhood safety influence children's outdoor
play.
