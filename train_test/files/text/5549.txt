When children regularly spend many hours in the company
of an early childhood educator, the early childhood educator
is a proximal and highly influential element of the child's
evolving social and cultural ecology (Bronfenbrenner, 1979).
Early childhood educators' attitudes are pervasively impor-
tant: positive, enthusiastic attitudes to problem solving are
likely to engender enthusiasm and positivity in children's
approaches to learning, but the corollary holds true as well--
negative attitudes and avoidance of concepts are likely to
lead to negativity and avoidance in children (Bellock,
Gunderson, Ramirez, & Levine, 2010; Connor & Neal, 2014;
McCray & Chen, 2011; Stipek, Givvin, Salmon, &
MacGyver, 2001). In the context of early childhood educa-
tion, this influence occurs very early in a child's learning tra-
jectory and thus potentially affects children's perception of
their own abilities as they continue into formal school-based
education (Lake & Kelly, 2014; Tschannen-Moran &
Woolfolk Hoy, 2001) and onwards.
Much of an educator's attitude toward teaching mathe-
matics derives from memories and experiences relating to
their own mathematics learning, and is likely to influence
their teaching practice in some way (Brown, 2005).
Describing the "framing" function of cognitive schemas,
Bruner (1990) states that the prominent aspect of a memory
is often the attitude attached to that memory. Educators'
beliefs have been defined as "tacit, often unconsciously held
assumptions about students, classrooms, and the academic
material to be taught" (Kagan, 1992, p. 65), which are stable,
resistant to change, and manifest in their pedagogical prac-
tice. Changing beliefs and attitudes requires an individual to
make personal, cognitive adjustments to incorporate new
ideas. This is particularly difficult in the teaching environ-
ment if the changes do not align with the individual's per-
sonal beliefs and goals for children's learning (Curby et al.,
2009). The resistance may be a personal response to negative
memories rather than denial that supporting children's math-
ematical thinking is in children's interests (Ginsburg, Lee, &
Boyd, 2008). This is important, because studies have found a
connection between educators' attitudes to mathematics and
the attitudes of their students to mathematics (Bellock et al.,
2010; Connor & Neal, 2014; Kalder & Lesik, 2011).
Changes in recent years in early childhood education in
Australia have resulted in educators being mandated to imple-
ment a recognized early years learning framework (Australian
Children's Education and Care QualityAuthority [ACECQA],
2011). This requires educators to support children's mathe-
matical thinking and their acquisition of mathematical lan-
guage. A significant association has been found between the
frequency and duration of play-based mathematics activities

Play-Based Mathematics Activities
as a Resource for Changing Educator
Attitudes and Practice
Caroline Cohrssen1, Amelia Church1, and Collette Tayler1
Abstract
This multiple case study explored early childhood educators' implementation of a suite of play-based mathematics activities
with children aged 3 to 5 years in six different early childhood education and care programs in Melbourne, Australia.
Educators approached the enactment of the activities differently; however, those educators who used the activities reasonably
frequently and with attention to the underpinning mathematical concepts reported an increase in their self-confidence in
supporting children's mathematical thinking. For these educators, increasing self-confidence, in conjunction with children's
enthusiasm, led to increased frequency and further gains in self-confidence. Some educators did not implement the activities
and no change in attitude was observed. New ways to support early childhood mathematics teaching practice, as a means to
challenge entrenched attitudes and beliefs, are needed.

enacted within early childhood programs and children's
learning outcomes (Cohrssen, Tayler, & Cloney, 2015).
However, new ideas are inevitably filtered through existing
knowledge structures (Curby et al., 2009; Kagan, 1992) and
conceptual change is difficult. Consequently, some aspects of
educators' practice remain unaltered (Spillane & Zeuli, 1999;
Stigler & Herbert, 1998). Variability of early childhood prac-
titioners' knowledge, attitudes, and professional practices
leads to inconsistency in fidelity of implementation (Zvoch,
2009), a situation which is further confounded by variables
specific to individual settings (Durlak, 2010; Zvoch, 2009)
such as individual educators' own mathematics knowledge.
Nonetheless, whereas educators' attitudes, beliefs, and confi-
dence in their mathematics abilities affect the extent to which
they intentionally teach mathematical ideas (Lee & Ginsburg,
2009), educators' confidence is a variable that can be
addressed by targeted professional learning (Chen, McCray,
Adams, & Leow, 2014), and changes to teachers' practices,
when observed to contribute to changes in children's learning
outcomes, have been associated with changes in teachers'
beliefs (Guskey, 2002a, 2002b).
Educators need to have a clear vision of how curriculum
materials are intended to help children learn and faith that
the curriculum materials provided will equip them to sup-
port students achieving the intended learning objectives;
further, curriculum materials need to support teachers'
learning along with children's learning (Drake & Sherin,
2009). Increased educator self-confidence is likely to be
associated with more frequent mathematics talk in early
childhood settings. This is important because learning
mathematical language is an important tool for exploring
mathematical ideas and the amount of educators' maths talk
has been found to be significantly related to growth in chil-
dren's mathematics knowledge (Klibanoff, Levine,
Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, & Hedges, 2006). One of the aims
of this study--and the focus of this article--was to observe
the effect of providing teaching materials in the form of a
suite of play-based mathematics activities with clear learn-
ing objectives, step-by-step explanations for the activities,
and a description of the mathematical thinking that under-
pins each activity, on early childhood (EC) educators' atti-
tudes toward mathematics in early childhood. We
anticipated that supporting educators' pedagogical prac-
tices may contribute to an increase in their self-confidence
and a more positive attitude toward intentionally support-
ing mathematical thinking during play-based activities.
Method
Changes in children's learning outcomes, observed to be
associated with the frequency and duration of the play-based
activities presented by the educators in this study, have
already been reported (Cohrssen et al., 2015). The aim of this
article is to explore the mechanisms at work that contributed
to the change in teachers' attitudes.
Participants
This implementation study was positioned within a broader
longitudinal study, the E4Kids study (Tayler, Ishimine,
Cleveland, Cloney, & Thorpe, 2013). Potential participants
were selected according to room-level Instructional Support
scores recorded for educators employed at early childhood
education and care (ECEC) centers in the state of Victoria
during the first round of E4Kids' data collection. For the pur-
pose of this sample, the room that received the lowest
Instructional Support score using the Classroom Assessment
Scoring System pre-K to K (Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008)
was the start of the "low" category and the median score was
the start of the "mid range" category. Although all room-level
readings of Instructional Support were relatively low, for the
mid range category, the first author contacted one center
immediately above the median score, followed by one center
below, repeating this pattern to remain as close to the median
score as possible. The room with the maximum Instructional
Support score was the start of the "high" category. Minimum
and maximum scores are presented in Table 1.
Many of the 128 educators involved in the E4Kids study
in Victoria during the first round of data collection were
excluded. Grounds for exclusion included, for example, the
consented educator having resigned or retired, the majority
of the children in the room being aged below 3 years, educa-
tors were employed at family day care centers1 or sessional
kindergartens,2 and in one instance, a potential conflict of
interest was identified as the lead educator worked with the
first author in a different capacity.
After approaching remaining potential participants by
telephone, the first author met with center coordinators and
educators to describe the study and the implications of par-
ticipating in the study in more detail. Participation consent
was then sought at center level and from educators.
Five participants were female and one was male.
Educators' qualifications ranged from a 2-year diploma in
early childhood services to a master's degree in early child-
hood education (see Table 2). All participants held full-time
appointments. The first educator in Room 4 unexpectedly
took long leave mid-way through the study; however, the
assistant educator in the room stepped up immediately to the
lead role and undertook to continue with the study. None of
the participants had attended any post-qualification EC
mathematics professional learning sessions. A remark made
by the lead educator in Room 5 illuminates this point:

. . . there's not a lot of professional development for early
childhood workers in maths, like you know, at the conference
that we went to in June there was none, but there's sessions
about literacy, there's sessions about incorporating indigenous
culture, there's sessions about social emotional development,
but there's no sessions about maths or science . . . there's a lot of
stuff I suppose that they do in early years in primary schools that
would relate to us as well.
Play-Based Mathematics Activities
The play-based mathematics activities included in the study
were drawn primarily from the American Navigations Series
(Cavanagh et al., 2004; Findell et al., 2001; Greenes,
Cavanagh, Dacey, Findell, & Small, 2001; Sheffield et al.,
2002) as no early childhood mathematics curriculum had
been formally validated with young children in Australia.
Additional activities that provided play-based number word
and counting activities more appropriate to an Australian
early childhood context were adapted from an additional
early years mathematics text (Wright, Stanger, Stafford, &
Martland, 2006). Activities related to number and opera-
tions; data collection, organization, and display; and geome-
try and algebra. Mathematical concepts underpinning the
activity were described in each case, and clear learning
objectives facilitated formative assessment of children's
understanding.
Activities explicitly encouraged educators to talk about
the activity and to encourage children's problem solving,
experimentation, and investigation, for example,
Talk about how the patterns are different and how they are the
same
and
When children are about to place their card on the washing line,
ask questions such as "Is it before or after this number?" and
"Which two numbers should it go between?"
With the exception of a teddy bear, as one activity required a
familiar toy to be used in an activity focusing on language of
location, educators were provided with all necessary equip-
ment (from numeral cards to clothes pegs), an instruction
manual that described the delivery of each activity, including
learning objectives and the mathematical concepts underpin-
ning each activity, and an abbreviated card each educator
could keep beside them as a prompt when presenting an
activity. Educators were at liberty to implement the activities
in the order that best suited the broader room curriculum.
Although not "free play" activities, the activities were
planned, "playful explorations" (Yelland, 2001, p. 6), enacted
initially as educator guided, small group learning experi-
ences. For example, one counting activity required each
child to roll a die, identify the number rolled by subitizing or
counting the dots, and count a corresponding number of col-
ored counters from a pile in the center of the table. Players
then compared how many counters they had "won" and
talked about who had "more than," "less than," and "the
same as," articulating their reasoning. Some educators spoke
of playing games with the children and then making the
games available to children to use independently. Further
examples of the activities are provided in the appendix.
Data
Self-reported data were obtained from two sources--
implementation logs and semi-structured interviews. Semi-
structured interviews with participants at three points over a
7-month period were audio-recorded, transcribed, and ana-
lyzed thematically to explore participants' reported imple-
mentation approach and to gain insight into the participants'
attitudes at the start and at the end of the study toward play-
fully yet intentionally teaching mathematical concepts in
their programs.
First-round interview questions were the same for each
educator. Second-round interviews explored issues raised by
different educators or observed mid-way through the study.
Third-round interviews were very similar in content as issues
raised by most participants were in fact similar.
At the start of the study, participants undertook to use one
activity each day with a small group of children. Because it

was not possible for the first author to monitor patterns of
implementation directly on a week-by-week basis to observe
nuances of implementation (Baker, Kupersmidt, Voegler-
Lee, Arnold, & Willoughby, 2010), the second source of data
was implementation logs. Educators were asked to complete
the log after the implementation of an activity noting the
date, how many children participated in the activity, how
long the activity was sustained, and what changes were
made, if any, to the delivery of the activity. The implementa-
tion logs provided an indication of frequency, duration, and
fidelity of implementation of the suite of learning activities.
Results and Discussion
Table 3 provides a summary of the educators' engage-
ment with the activities and an indication of reported
self-confidence at various points throughout the project.
Notable is the relationship between the consistency and fre-
quency of implementation--that is, engaging small groups
of children in the activities--and educator attitude toward or
perception of the merit of the play-based opportunities for
mathematical thinking. Specifically, those educators who
used the activities reasonably frequently, intentionally focus-
ing on the underpinning mathematical concepts as set out in
the description of each activity, reported an increase in their
self-confidence in supporting children's mathematical think-
ing. For these educators, increasing self-confidence com-
bined with the enthusiasm with which children took part in
the activities, led to changes in their practice. Activities were
implemented more frequently and children's learning was
observed. Supported by growing familiarity with the activi-
ties, implementation frequency increased and further gains in
educators' self-confidence were reported. Educators' reports
of self-efficacy are also included in the summary, and the
implications are considered in the discussion to follow.
Implementation of Activities
Wide implementation variability, in enactment and fre-
quency, was observed among participants in this study
despite their initial undertakings to present at least one activ-
ity each day to a small group of children. First, we discuss
low implementation cases. The discussion will then address
reports from teachers who implemented the play-based
activities with greater frequency and consistency.
After 4 weeks, the educator in Room 1 withdrew from the
study. In this program, the activities (designed to be small
group activities) were presented to groups as large as 17,
resulting in children spending a lot of time waiting for a turn.
The educator selected activities based on perceived ease of
delivery, rather than their "fit" to children's observed skills
and understanding. Taking both characteristics of delivery into
account, it is not surprising that children's engagement was
sub-optimal and may have contributed to the teacher's report
that the children did not "respect the equipment" (see Table 3).
There was a change in staff in Room 4. The second educator in
Room 4 set up activities in the room after recalling that they
were in the storeroom; however, the selection of activities
appears to have been unsystematic. The educator in Room 5
rarely implemented the activities and similarly kept them in
the storeroom. Finally, the implementation strategy employed
by the educator in Room 6 cannot be established, as this
teacher did not complete implementation logs.
Our attention now turns to the educators in Rooms 2 and
3, and the first educator in Room 4. These educators took a
systematic approach to implementing the activities. In
Room 2, activities were used as an add-on to the program
throughout the study, however in response to children's
demands--and the educator's recognition that the activities
afforded opportunities for social and emotional learning--
the activities were used with increasing frequency. The edu-
cator reported that she came to see that learning priorities in
the broader program were supported by the play-based
mathematics activities. Consequently, not only were they
used more frequently, but the educator also deliberately
revisited some of the activities that had been presented ear-
lier in the year:
. . . not everyone's had the opportunity to do every game . . .
because some are here five days, some are here one day, some
are two days . . . maybe sometimes it's to give someone else an
opportunity to do that. Or maybe . . . I thought, "oh no, I do
understand that a bit better now" or what the outcome (should
have been). (Room 2, Round 3 interview)
The educator in Room 3 described uncertainty about how to
go about teaching mathematical ideas in her program and
consequently enacted the activities with a high degree of
fidelity; she followed instructions provided for each activity
closely. Children's enthusiastic participation in the activities,
coupled with the educator's growing confidence and famil-
iarity with the suite of activities resulted in more frequent,
flexible, and open-ended use of the materials.
The first educator in Room 4 incorporated the activities in
the program plan from the start of the study, selecting activi-
ties that aligned with children's interests:
If the children are really . . . interested in Snakes and Ladders
and using the dice, so that would be something that comes out,
and then . . . you can explain to children how you use the dice in
that situation and how you use it when you're playing Snakes
and Ladders . . . (Room 4, Educator 1, exit interview)
One activity was set up each week on a designated table in
the room. Although each activity involved small groups of
children, the educator usually waited for children to initiate
the play at this table and most activities were then teacher
directed in their delivery.
Having provided a broad brush stroke description of how
educators approached the incorporation of the suite of activi-
ties in their curricula, the next section narrows our focus to

the use of specific learning objectives for each game to assess
children's learning through play.
Formative Assessment of Children's Learning
Educators in Rooms 2 and 3 reflected on the contribution of
the suite of learning experiences to their observation and
assessment of children's learning, as well as to curriculum
planning.
The educator in Room 2 commented on unanticipated
opportunities for turn-taking, peer conversations and for
children to lead activities.
. . . I suppose my opinion has changed a little bit, that I didn't
realise, I hadn't thought how much they might enjoy it and how
much they're still doing all those things I'm wanting them to do,
you know, like the sharing and . . . [interruption] . . . when
they're interested in something, often they will put a little bit
more effort into that socio-emotional stuff, yeah I will wait for
my turn, yeah I will let them have their turn, do you know what
I mean? Cause I want to have my turn. So yeah, I have found
that that's a real positive. (Room 2, Round 2 interview)
In addition, the children's response to the activities was
remarked upon several times during the course of the study:
. . . they've really enjoyed them . . . you know, it's been
challenging for them, and they've enjoyed having the play-
based maths . . . yeah, they've enjoyed having the activities.
Cause when I pull out a game, I say, "I want to play a game,"
they're very eager to do that. Like, a lot of the board-type games,
and then they will . . . I say, "Well, we're not gonna fight over
this pink card" or something,3 and they have to agree, yes we
won't, because we really want to play the game. (Room 2,
Round 2 interview)
Explicit learning objectives focused the educator's observa-
tions and were used to assess whether children had mastered
underpinning mathematical concepts and were ready to
explore extension activities, or whether further rehearsal or a
drop-back activity would be appropriate. Conversations with
families were informed by the educator's assessment of the
extent to which children achieved learning objectives embed-
ded in activities, supporting meaningful conversations with
families about their children's learning.
Yeah, some have found it easy; others of the same age and same
skill in counting and making patterns still found that difficult . . .
they do sort of patterns in music and we do, like, beading.
They've done a lot of patterns and stuff like that, so I thought
they had an understanding of patterns, but then sometimes with
the clowns like sitting there in front of them, it's almost like . . .

they didn't realise they know how to do it, you know. They
thought this is more complicated or something. (Room 2, Round
2 interview)
The educator in Room 3 spoke of increasing self-confi-
dence and excitement at her growing ability to observe,
assess, and support children's learning by using the learn-
ing objectives for each activity to assess children's under-
standing. Encouraged to persevere by the children's positive
response to the games, this educator described having pre-
viously over- or underestimated different children's
competency.
I've got one child who has been in care [child care] since she
was a baby five days a week, and very proactive at home, very
proactive here. Whenever we do any of these activities, she
knows straight away. I watched her the other day. She goes,
"You've added an extra two there." She was explaining it to one
of the other children, because they couldn't quite figure it out.
She goes, "Well, you've added an extra two, so that makes six."
And I'm just looking at her . . . And then we did the patterning,
and straight away, after, I said, "You can come up with your own
pattern and picture," she was the first one to sit there, put all the
pieces together, figured out her pattern, drew it up, and said, "It
reminds me of a mouse" and then continued pattern making.
(Room 3, Round 1 interview)
But also the children are the ones who are driving it, because
they have particular games in there that they love, so they won't
let me do the other ones. (Room 3, Round 2 interview)
At the start of the study, the first educator in Room 4
described intentionally using learning objectives to assess
children's mathematical understanding as a new approach:
Writing down all that--how they went and what happened and
all that--and observing all that is more what we normally do.
(Teacher 1, Room 4, Round 1 interview)
This issue was pursued at the second (exit) interview with
the first lead educator. It appears that the learning objec-
tives contributed to formative assessment of children's
knowledge and using learning objectives to support written
observations demonstrates a shift in this educator's teach-
ing practice:
At times, yeah, at times I did feel, oh I didn't know he could
do this, and that kind of helped plan further in the sense how
could it be more challenging for that child . . . So would you
write up observations based on what you'd seen from these
maths activities? Some of them, yes . . . because we have them
in daily reflections . . . (Teacher 1, Room 4, Round 2, exit
interview)
The second lead educator in Room 4 reported not having
used the activities as an opportunity to assess children's
learning:
No, I didn't personally, but I think . . . Actually I think (the
assistant) did. Another educator in the room, I think she saw an
activity that was happening and some concepts that were being
used, I think it was the geometry patterns one. (Teacher 2, Room
4, Round 3 interview)
The second lead teacher commented further:
. . . we thought (some of the activities) would be a bit too
difficult in that it would be more one-on-one, like teacher and
child, or we didn't really understand what the concept . . . or like
how to implement it, or we just didn't get time because we used
the same . . . sometimes we use the same activities later on in
each week . . . we feel that in our room it's just . . . like we'd love
to do one on one things but it's just too busy in our room to be
able to sit down and do that with other children . . . (Room 4,
Round 3 interview)
In summary, the educators in Rooms 2 and 3, and the first
educator in Room 4 remarked that many children's demon-
strated skills and understanding either exceeded or, con-
versely, did not yet meet the educators' expectations, when
assessed against the learning objectives provided for each
activity. It is well established in research and in practice that
children's mathematical understanding varies substantially
and much may be attributed to environmental stimuli (see,
for example, Gould, 2012; Klibanoff et al., 2006).
Recognizing this variability points to the critical importance
of authentic and accurate assessment to differentiate learning
opportunities for children.
Reported Changes in Attitude
We now consider how enacting the activities impacted on
educators' attitudes toward intentionally teaching mathemat-
ics in early childhood. Two participants (Rooms 1 and 2)
raised concerns about incorporating another element in their
programs.
The educator in Room 1 withdrew from the study.
The educator in Room 2 recognized that incorporating
the activities into the program provided opportunities to
extend children's mathematics learning and social and
emotional learning. Her attitude underwent a significant
change and the activities were enacted more frequently.
Rather than needing to unlearn existing understanding to
learn new ideas (Snider, 2004; Spillane, 2000), which
would have required a significant change in cognitive
schema, this educator quickly recognized benefits of imple-
menting the activities and was open to a more intentional,
evidence-based approach:
I think I have definitely been more mindful of the mathematics
in the children's play because . . . I know that they understand so
much more about it, about numbers now, so we have been able
to extend a little bit like when we're playing, you know, in
different . . . (Room 2, Round 3 interview)
8 SAGE Open
It made me more focused and broadened (my) understanding of
different aspects of maths that can be taught to preschoolers,
that's my short answer. (Room 2, Round 3 interview)
The educators in Rooms 2 and 3 expressed concerns at the
start of the study about using "the right language."
Mathematics language-related uncertainty inhibited their
self-confidence and consequently their willingness to engage
children in such activities. Using the activities directly
addressed these concerns, as examples of questions and rel-
evant language to model were provided with each activity.
Reading the provided step-by-step explanations of each
activity was reported to equip the educators with sufficient
knowledge to feel more confident and consequently, to
model the language in conversations with children. This con-
tributed to an upward spiral of increasing self-confidence
and more frequent enactment of the activities and the educa-
tors' practice changed.
Echoing Bruner's (1990) statement that it is frequently
the attitude attached to a memory that persists, the educator
in Room 3 reflected on her own mathematics education:
. . . it was about right and wrong, and if you were wrong, there
was a consequence for getting it wrong at school with maths, I
found. Or they made it very competitive, you know, who could
get it quicker could get this, could have this prize, or whatever it
was, so that already would put anxiety there about getting it
right, and then . . . I don't know what everyone else's experience
is, for me it would be about I just shut down so I wouldn't think
at all. (Room 3, Round 2 interview)
This educator's personal experience of mathematics differed
substantially from the play-based approach in which enact-
ment of the activities demanded, and required, personal
memories and deep-seated, learned attitudes toward mathe-
matics to be set aside (Bruner, 1990) to learn new ideas
(Snider, 2004; Spillane, 2000). The speed with which the
educator's attitude turned around was remarkable. By the
end of the study, the conversation was more light-hearted
(evidenced by her laughter). Rather than focusing on a per-
ceived skills deficit, the educator spoke of improving her
own skills to influence children's regard for mathematics
positively:
Yes, I think I don't know enough (about mathematics). (Laughs.)
And also because I don't have that confidence in mathematics as
well and I think that's something I need to work on because I'm
trying to give something to the next generation, to give them the
groundwork and the interest in maths, not just literacy . . . (Room
3, Round 3 interview)
A marked change in attitude was apparent at the end of the
study:
For me, I think it is because this is not something that I'm going
to stop now just simply because we've done the study. So to me,
it's a lifelong journey. And I think well if I take this activity,
where can I take it? Can I take it to something else, or can I keep
using it over and over again because it's a useful tool as well for
assessing where children are also, and helping them with
numeracy. I'd like to keep going and see when I've got that extra
time that I can make to work on it, what will the difference be for
me as a teacher as well? And then for the children, what will
happen? (Room 3, Round 3 interview)
The educators in Rooms 4 and 5 waited for children to initi-
ate interactions around the activity or request an activity--
although the activities were not always accessible to the
children as they were stored in a different room. Their atti-
tudes remained unchanged throughout the duration of the
study, reflecting their persistent pedagogical beliefs about
the role of the early childhood educator. Although all three
educators in these rooms stated a belief in the importance of
supporting children's emerging mathematics skills, none
believed this to include purposeful formative assessment to
plan systematically to support and extend children's devel-
oping mathematical thinking. Somewhat ironically, both
educators in Room 4 were observed to engage in highly
teacher-directed, question-and-answer interaction patterns,
thus creating or perpetuating the pressure for children "to get
it right," an approach that both educators reported intending
to avoid. Research has demonstrated that educators filter
new ideas through existing knowledge (Curby et al., 2009;
Kagan, 1992) and when exposed to new ideas, are inclined to
focus on superficial similarities to familiar knowledge and
unlearning may be required to gain new knowledge (Snider,
2004; Spillane, 2000). However, this process of unlearning is
not always successful and practice may not change (Spillane
& Zeuli, 1999; Stigler & Herbert, 1998). In both cases, by
choosing to join in with children's play only when requested,
rather than guiding children's use of the play-based activities
in a purposeful manner, these educators limited their oppor-
tunities to observe the gains in children's learning that when
coupled with a change in teaching practice, contribute to
changes in teachers' beliefs and attitudes (Guskey, 2002a,
2002b).
The educator in Room 6 did not provide implementation
logs, but reported in interviews that using the activities
prompted her awareness that she did not lack the necessary
skills and understanding to deliver the resources. This aware-
ness proved empowering, and her anxiety at the start of the
study was reportedly replaced by an increasing sense of
self-confidence.
Conclusion
Early childhood educators have reported a need for increased
professional learning in early childhood mathematics
(Barber, Cohrssen, & Church, 2014). We know that educa-
tors' mathematics content knowledge predicts children's
learning and engagement in mathematical thinking (Hill,
Cohrssen et al. 9
Rowan, & Loewenberg Ball, 2005; Shulman, 1986).
Furthermore, educators' attitudes, beliefs, and confidence
impact on how mathematics teaching is (or is not) purpose-
fully incorporated in early childhood programs (Lee &
Ginsburg, 2009). Chen and colleagues (2014) have found
that educators' confidence can be addressed by targeted pro-
fessional learning. In this study, we observed the impact of
implementing play-based mathematics activities with small
groups of children on some early childhood educators'confi-
dence, beliefs, and attitudes toward purposefully teaching
mathematics in early childhood.
When educators persevered with play-based activities
that clearly set out the intended mathematics learning and
provided examples of questions for teachers to ask to suit
children's emerging understanding, their confidence
increased. It appeared that this was a collaborative and itera-
tive process: reviewing the objectives of each activity famil-
iarized the educators with the underpinning mathematical
ideas and supported their ability to recognize when children
achieved the learning objectives. As their confidence grew,
and spurred on by children's enthusiastic response and
observed learning gains, activities were enacted more fre-
quently. When the suite of activities was enacted with rea-
sonable fidelity and frequency, children's made gains in
learning (Cohrssen et al., 2015).
Professional learning and change in teacher practice,
when observed to contribute to change in children's learn-
ing outcomes, contributes to change in teacher attitudes and
beliefs (Guskey, 2002a, 2002b). Educators who imple-
mented the activities systematically reported a change in
attitude and beliefs, as the activities-as-resource (a) demon-
strated opportunities for supporting social and emotional
learning, (b) provided educators with the explicit language
to both enact the activities and to share the aims of this
play-based learning with children's families, (c) equipped
educators with strategies to facilitate children's learning by
providing greater specificity in learning objectives, which
subsequently (d) supported gains in children's learning
(Cohrssen et al., 2015), and (e) facilitated formative assess-
ment of and for learning.
Although the suite of activities was not designed as a pro-
fessional development resource per se, providing educators
with information about specific mathematical concepts as
well as step-by-step instructions for the implementation of
the games, in effect supported the educators' professional
learning. Those educators who implemented the activities
changed their teaching practice. When the learning objec-
tives were used to support formative assessment of children's
knowledge, educators observed the efficacy of their practice.
This positive outcome, coupled with children's observed
enthusiasm in taking part in the activities encouraged educa-
tors to change their beliefs and to offer further activities from
the provided suite of activities.
Increasingly positive attitudes to the activities and greater
self-confidence led to more frequent use of the activities, and
thus more systematic implementation. Importantly, an
increase in educators' self-confidence in teaching mathemat-
ics is likely to lead to educators modeling positive attitudes
about mathematics to children, encouraging children to feel
positive about mathematics (Kalder & Lesik, 2011).
Children's positive responses to educators initiating these
activities encouraged educators to persevere, and thus, the
cycle of teaching and learning continued.
Familiarity with the learning objectives of activities and
increased self-confidence enable educators to approach the
activities in a more purposeful manner, facilitating the
learning in play-based learning, reflecting an imperative in
effective early childhood education (ACECQA, 2011;
Cohrssen, Church, Ishimine, & Tayler, 2013; Department
of Education Employment and Workplace Relations,
2009). Specific learning objectives also provided educa-
tors with competencies against which to assess children's
developing understanding in an objective manner. This in
turn facilitated accurate, evidence-based teaching. In short,
by providing a range of play-based activities that were rel-
evant and interesting to the children, along with accompa-
nying instructions, prompts, and suggestions for extending
activities, educators were better equipped to enact child-
centered practice.
The over-arching goal of early childhood education is
to provide optimal learning opportunities for children.
Implementation of a suite of play-based early childhood
mathematics activities provided early childhood educa-
tors with the resources needed to support and extend pre-
school children's mathematical thinking and mathematical
language. Implicit in this process is ongoing formative
assessment of children's learning. This not only enables
educators to tailor learning experiences to support chil-
dren's demonstrated interests and skills but also provides
educators with regular feedback on the efficacy of their
efforts, increasing the likelihood that they will persevere
with the new practices and contributing to a change in
teacher beliefs regarding early childhood mathematics
(Guskey, 2002a, 2002b).
Our findings show that the provision and enactment of
a purposefully designed suite of play-based mathematics
activities may enable educators to develop increasing con-
fidence in the intentional teaching of mathematics in early
learning environments. This is encouraging evidence of
the potential impact of an evidence-based, play-based, val-
idated early childhood mathematics curriculum. Finding
ways to challenge educators' beliefs and to encourage new
ways of thinking about mathematics teaching and learning
are crucial if educators are to meet the demands of early
childhood education and the future learning needs of
children.
