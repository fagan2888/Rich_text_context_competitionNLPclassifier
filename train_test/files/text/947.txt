Adoption as a Risk Factor for Attempted Suicide During Adolescence
Gail Slap, MD; Elizabeth Goodman, MD; and Bin Huang, MS
ABSTRACT. Objective. Depression, impulsivity, and
aggression during adolescence have been associated with
both adoption and suicidal behavior. Studies of adopted
adults suggest that impulsivity, even more than depres-
sion, may be an inherited factor that mediates suicidal
behavior. However, the association between adoption
and adolescent suicide attempts and the mechanisms that
might explain it remain unknown. The objective of this
study was to determine the following: 1) whether suicide
attempts are more common among adolescents who live
with adoptive parents rather than biological parents; 2)
whether the association is mediated by impulsivity, and
3) whether family connectedness decreases the risk of
suicide attempt regardless of adoptive or biological sta-
tus.
Methods. A secondary analysis of Wave I data from
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
was conducted, which used a school-based, clustered
sampling design to identify a nationally representative
sample of 7th- to 12th-grade students, with oversampling
of underrepresented groups. Of the 90 118 adolescents
who completed the National Longitudinal Study of Ad-
olescent Health in-school survey, 17 125 completed the
in-home interview and had parents of identified gender
who completed separate in-home questionnaire. The
subset of adolescents for this study was drawn from the
in-home sampling according to the following criteria: 1)
adolescent living with adoptive or biological mother at
the time of the interview, 2) adolescent had never been
separated from mother for more than 6 months, 3) mother
was in first marriage at the time of the interview, and 4)
the adoptive mother had never been married to the ado-
lescent's biological father. Of the 6577 adolescents in the
final study sample, 214 (3.3%) were living with adoptive
mothers and 6363 (96.7%) were living with biological
mothers.
Variables. The primary outcome measured was ado-
lescent report of suicide attempt(s) in the past year. Other
variables included in the analyses were sociodemograph-
ics characteristics (gender, age, race/ethnicity, family in-
come, parental education), general health (self-rated
health, routine examination in the past year, need for
medical care in the past year that was not obtained),
mental health (depressive symptoms, self-image, trouble
relaxing in the past year, bad temper, psychological or
emotional counseling in the past year), risk behaviors
(cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, sexual intercourse ever,
delinquency, physical fighting in the past year, impul-
sive decision making), school-related characteristics
(grade point average, school connectedness), and family
interaction (family connectedness, parental presence, ma-
ternal satisfaction with parent­adolescent relationship).
Data Analysis. Univariate analyses were used to
compare adoptees versus nonadoptees, suicide attempt-
ers versus nonsuicide attempters, and adopted suicide
attempters versus nonadopted suicide attempters on all
variables. Variables that were associated with attempted
suicide were entered into a forward stepwise logistic
regression procedure, and variables that were associated
with the log odds of attempt were retained in the model.
The area under the model's receiver operating character-
istic curve was calculated as a measure of its overall
performance. After the association of adoption with at-
tempted suicide was demonstrated, the potential mediat-
ing effect of impulsivity was explored by adding it to the
model. The same procedure was followed for any vari-
able that was associated with adoption in the full sample
or the subsample of suicide attempters. To determine
whether any variable in the model moderated the asso-
ciation between adoption and suicide attempt, the inter-
action term for that variable  adoption was forced into
the model.
Results. Adoptees differed significantly from non-
adoptees on 4 of 26 variables. They were more likely to
have attempted suicide (7.6% vs 3.1%) and to have re-
ceived psychological or emotional counseling in the past
year (16.9% vs 8.2%), and their mothers reported higher
parental education and family income. Attempters dif-
fered significantly from nonattempters on all variables
except for age, race/ethnicity, parental education, family
income, and routine examination in the past year. On
logistic regression, 9 variables were independently asso-
ciated with attempted suicide: depression (adjusted odds
ratio [AOR]: 3.41), counseling (AOR: 2.83), female gender
(AOR: 2.31), cigarette use (AOR: 2.31), delinquency
(AOR: 2.17), adoption (AOR: 1.98), low self-image (AOR:
1.78), aggression (AOR: 1.48), and high family connect-
edness (AOR: 0.60). The receiver operating characteristic
curve for the model had an area of 0.834, indicating
performance significantly better than chance. The AOR
for adoption did not change when parental education,
family income, and impulsivity were forced into the
model. None of the interaction terms (adoption  an-
other risk factor) demonstrated a significant effect.
Conclusions. Attempted suicide is more common
among adolescents who live with adoptive parents than
among adolescents who live with biological parents. The
association persists after adjusting for depression and
aggression and is not explained by impulsivity as mea-
sured by a self-reported tendency to make decisions
quickly. Although the mechanism underlying the asso-
ciation remains unclear, recognizing the adoptive status
may help health care providers to identify youths who
are at risk and to intervene before a suicide attempt
occurs. It is important to note, however, that the great
majority of adopted youths do not attempt suicide and
that adopted and nonadopted youths in this study did

Studies of the psychosocial function of adopted
adolescents vary widely in their methods, find-
ings, and interpretations. A 1998 review of the
literature1 cites 7 studies that demonstrate no differ-
ences between adopted and nonadopted adoles-
cents,2­8 15 that demonstrate poorer adjustment
among adopted adolescents,9­23 and 3 that demon-
strate better adjustment among adopted adolescents
on at least some variables.24­26 Much of the disagree-
ment is attributable to differences in the populations
of adopted youths that are studied and the control
groups with which they are compared. For example,
adopted and nonadopted subjects differ more when
drawn from clinical rather than community popula-
tions.27­30 Subjects who are adopted in late childhood
differ more from nonadopted subjects than do sub-
jects who are adopted in infancy.29,31­33 Late-adopted
subjects who were neglected during early childhood
demonstrate more psychosocial difficulty during ad-
olescence than do late-adopted subjects who were
well cared for.29
The greatest controversy in the literature compar-
ing adopted and nonadopted adolescents rests with
the nature versus nurture interpretation of the re-
ported differences. Although the study of adopted
individuals has been an important strategy for ex-
ploring the genetic and family-associated environ-
mental factors related to psychiatric disorders, its
focus has been on the comparison of adoptive and
biological relatives of adoptees rather than on the
comparison of adoptees and nonadoptees. Conse-
quently, findings that support an association of a
given mental health disorder with family genetics
rather than with family environment do not neces-
sarily indicate that adoption is a risk factor for the
disorder.
In an important adoption study designed to ex-
plore the role of genetics and family environment in
the cause of mood disorders, Wender et al34 found
significantly higher rates of unipolar depression, sui-
cide, and attempted suicide among the biological
rather than the adoptive relatives of adult subjects
with mood disorders. The suicide rate among the
biological relatives of subjects with a history of pan-
ic-type behavior or an impulsive suicide attempt was
even higher, suggesting that impulsivity rather than
depression may be the inherited factor that mediates
suicidal behavior. In adolescents, impulsivity and
aggression have been associated with both suicidal
behavior35­38 and adoption,29,35,36,39 and in both
cases, gender and social environment modify the
reported associations. Although these findings sug-
gest an association between adoption and suicidal
behavior, it is unknown whether adoptive status in-
creases an adolescent's risk for suicide attempt or
completion.
This study used data from a large, national, school-
based survey to test the primary hypothesis that
attempted suicide is more common among adoles-
cents who live with adoptive parents than among
adolescents who live with biological parents. Second,
we hypothesized that the association is mediated by
impulsivity. Third, we hypothesized that one aspect
of social environment--family connectedness--de-
creases the risk of suicidal behavior independent of
adoptive or biological status.
METHODS
This study is based on data from The National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), the largest and most
comprehensive survey of adolescents ever performed in the
United States. Add Health was developed to examine the associ-
ations among health-related behaviors, social contexts, and phys-
ical environments. Data were collected through 4 surveys admin-
istered during Wave I (September 1994 through December 1995)
and 2 surveys administered during Wave II (April 1996 through
August 1996).24,40 The data for this study were drawn from the
Wave I in-home sample.
Design of Add Health
Add Health used a school-based, clustered sampling design to
identify a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the
7th through 12th grades of 134 schools, with specific over-
samples.24 An in-school questionnaire was completed by 90 118
adolescents between September 1994 and April 1995. Students
who completed the questionnaire plus students who did not com-
plete the questionnaire but were enrolled in the schools were
eligible for inclusion in an in-home sample. A random subset of
15 243 adolescents stratified by gender and grade were selected,
and the 12 105 adolescents who completed in-home interviews
composed the core in-home sample. In addition, special over-
samples were drawn for the in-home survey to provide represen-
tation of ethnic minorities, in-school social networks, youths with
physical disabilities, and siblings. The total in-home sample there-
fore consisted of the 20 745 adolescents who completed interviews
between April 1995 and December 1995. A parent of each adoles-
cent respondent, preferably the mother residing with the adoles-
cent, was asked to complete a separate in-home questionnaire.
Questionnaires were completed by 17 125 parents of identified
gender between April 1995 and December 1995.24
The in-school survey was a self-administered paper question-
naire completed during a 45- to 60-minute class period on a
designated school day. Students who were absent from the class
were not given another opportunity to complete the question-
naire. To maximize confidentiality on the 90-minute in-home in-
terview, the adolescent recorded all answers on a laptop com-
puter. An interviewer read less-sensitive questions aloud to the
adolescent. More-sensitive questions were prerecorded, and the
adolescent listened to the audiotape through earphones and re-
corded the answer directly into the computer using audio-CASI
technology.41 The 30-minute parent questionnaire was interview-
er-assisted and op-scanned.24
Study Sample
The sample for this study was drawn from the Wave I set of
17 125 adolescents who completed in-home surveys and whose
parents completed in-home surveys. An adolescent was consid-
ered eligible if he or she was living with his or her adoptive or
biological mother at the time of the in-home interview and had
never been separated from her for more than 6 months. If the
adolescent's mother had not completed the parent questionnaire,
was not married at the time of data collection, or had been married
more than once, then the adolescent was excluded from this study.
An adolescent who lived with an adoptive mother was excluded
2 of 8 ADOPTION AND ADOLESCENT SUICIDE ATTEMPTS
if the adoptive mother had ever been married to the adolescent's
biological father. The final sample consisted of 6577 adolescents.
Each adolescent in the study sample was categorized as
adopted or nonadopted according to information provided by the
mother on the in-home questionnaire. The adolescent was consid-
ered adopted when the mother identified herself as the adoptive
mother and nonadopted when the mother identified herself as the
biological mother. The question, "Are you adopted?" was asked
directly of adolescents on the in-school survey. However, because
25% of adolescents in Wave I did not complete the in-school
questionnaire, the item was not used to define adoptive or non-
adoptive status. It was included in the analysis to explore concor-
dance between adolescent and maternal report of adoption. Of the
6577 adolescents in the study sample, 214 (3.25%) met criteria for
the adopted group and 6363 (96.7%) met criteria for the non-
adopted group.
Variables Included in the Analyses
All of the variables described below were derived from items
on the in-home interviews of adolescents and their mothers. Some
of the variables were derived from single items, whereas others
were derived from groups of items. Participants who answered at
least 75% of the items that composed a multi-item variable were
included in the analysis of that variable. For these participants, the
ratings for unanswered items in a multi-item scale were imputed
from the mean rating of answered items in the scale. The study
variables and their assigned categories are described below.
Suicide Attempt
Adolescents used a 5-point Likert scale to answer the question,
"During the past 12 months, how many times did you actually
attempt suicide?" Responses were dichotomized into no attempt
versus 1 or more attempts. Add Health did not include a question
about suicide attempts ever.
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Gender was identified by the adolescent on the in-school inter-
view and validated by the in-home interviewer. Age was calcu-
lated from the date of interview and the date of birth. Racial/
ethnic identity was indicated by the adolescent, with instructions
to select the predominant affiliation if more than 1 was noted. The
response was categorized as white non-Hispanic, black non-His-
panic, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or other.
Family income was defined as the mother's report of the total
pretax income in dollars received by all household members in
1994, including dividends and welfare benefits. Report of 0 in-
come was considered a missing response. Otherwise, reported
income was adjusted for household size, compared with the 1994
threshold for poverty established by the US Census Bureau, and
assigned to 1 of the following 5 classes: 1) 1.5 times the poverty
threshold (a conservative estimate of substandard living condi-
tions),42 2) 1.5 to 2.5 times threshold, 3) 2.5 to 4 times threshold,
4) 4 times threshold but less than the top 5% of 1994 household
incomes, and 5) the top 5% of incomes.43
Parental education was determined from the mother's response
to the questions, "How far did you go in school?" and, "How far
did your partner/spouse go in school?" The higher of the 2
answers was defined as parental education and was assigned to 1
of the following 5 categories: 1) did not graduate from high school
and did not go to a vocational school instead of high school; 2)
graduated from high school, received a high-school equivalency
degree, or went to vocational school instead of high school; 3)
went to vocational school after high school or went to college but
did not graduate; 4) graduated from college; and 5) attended
professional school after college graduation.
General Health
The adolescents were asked to rate their health on a 5-point
Likert scale ranging from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Self-rated health
correlates with physical, mental, and social health. It is a valid and
reliable indicator in adolescents and adults that differentiates in-
dividuals with and without chronic disease and is predictive of
both the diagnosis of serious illness and the likelihood of surviv-
al.44,45
Two items about general health care were included in the
analyses. Adolescent responses to the question, "When did you
last have a physical examination by a doctor or nurse?" were
dichotomized as less than a year ago versus more than a year ago
or never. Adolescent responses to the question, "Has there been
any time over the past year when you thought you should get
medical care, but you did not?" were dichotomized as yes or no.
Mental Health
Add Health contains 16 of the original 20 items that composed
the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-
D).46,47 Two additional items from the CES-D were included in
modified form. The internal consistency of the modified 18-item
scale was excellent (Cronbach's   0.87) and decreased when any
item was dropped. The sum of these 18 items therefore was used
to impute the full 20-item CES-D score after correcting for unan-
swered items. Each item was rated on a scale of 0 to 3. Potential
CES-D scores thus ranged from 0 (no depressive symptoms) to 60
(maximum depressive symptoms).
In a study of 9th- to 12th-grade adolescents, Roberts et al47
found that the sensitivity and the specificity of the of the CES-D
for the detection of major depressive disorders were maximized at
scores of 24 for females and 22 for males. We used these
cutpoints in the current study to create a dichotomous variable
indicative of depression.
The self-image score was calculated as the mean of 6 items, each
of which was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (Cronbach's  
0.85).40 Potential scores ranged from 1 (high self-image) to 5 (low
self-image). Trouble relaxing in the past 12 months was assessed
by a single item on the adolescent survey rated on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (daily). Bad temper was assessed by a
single dichotomous item on the parent survey asking whether the
adolescent had a bad temper.
Previous mental health care was assessed by dichotomized
yes/no responses to the question, "In the past year, have you
received psychological or emotional counseling?"
Risk Behaviors
Items that assessed cigarette use were combined to create a
variable with the following 6 levels: 1  never smoked, 2  never
smoked a whole cigarette, 3  smoked a whole cigarette but not in
the past 30 days, 4  smoked at least a whole cigarette but less
than a pack per week in the past 30 days, 5  smoked at least a
pack per week but less than a pack per day in the past 30 days, and
6  smoked at least a pack per day in the past 30 days.
Items that assessed alcohol use were combined to create a
variable with the following 5 levels: 0  never had alcohol, 1 
had alcohol but not on more that 1 or 2 days in the past 12 months,
2  had alcohol on more than 2 days in the past 12 months but less
than every week in the past 12 months, 3  had alcohol on 1 to 5
days a week in the past 12 months, 4  had alcohol every day or
almost every day in the past 12 months.
Items that assessed marijuana use were combined to create a
variable with the following 5 levels: 0  never used, 1  used but
not in the past 30 days, 2  used 1 to 3 times in the past 30 days,
3  used 4 to 29 times in the past 30 days, 4  used 30 or more
times in the past 30 days.
Sexual activity was assessed as a yes/no answer to the ques-
tion, "Have you ever had sexual intercourse?" Delinquency was
assessed as the sum of 15 items, each rated on a scale of 0 to 2
(Cronbach's   0.84). Potential scores thus ranged from 0 to 30.
Aggression was assessed by the question, "During the past 12
months, how often did you get into a physical fight?" Responses
were dichotomized as "once" and "more than once" versus "nev-
er." Impulsivity was assessed by the statement, "When making
decisions, you usually go with your ``gut feeling' without thinking
too much about the consequences of each alternative." Responses
were dichotomized as "strongly agree" and "agree" versus "nei-
ther agree nor disagree," "disagree," and "strongly disagree."
School
Two variables that pertained to school were included in the
analyses. The adolescent's grade point average was the average of
the self-reported letter grades at the last grading period in at least
2 of 4 core subjects: English, mathematics, history, and science.
The grades were coded as follows: 1  A, 2  B, 3  C, 4  D or
worse.
The school connectedness scale score was derived from 8 items,
http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/108/2/e30 3 of 8
each rated on a 5-point Likert scale (Cronbach's   0.75).40 Four
items were rated on a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings for 3 items
originally were coded by Add Health investigators on a scale of 0
to 4; these ratings were recoded on a scale of 1 to 5 to maintain
consistency across items. The 8 item ratings were summed to yield
a scale score with a potential range of 8 (low connectedness) to 40
(high connectedness).
Family
Three variables that pertained to family relationships were
included in the analyses. The family connectedness scale score
was derived from 13 items (Cronbach's   0.83).40 Each item was
rated on a scale of 1 (low connectedness) to 5 (high connected-
ness). The ratings of 3 items were averaged to yield a mean. The 10
remaining items were divided into 4 subgroups, and the highest
rating within each subgroup was selected to represent the sub-
group. The 5 resulting ratings were summed to yield a scale score
with a potential range of 5 (low connectedness) to 25 (high con-
nectedness).
The parental presence scale consists of 7 items and has a po-
tential range of 4 (low presence) to 22 (high presence)40; its method
of construction precludes use of Cronbach's . Maternal satisfac-
tion with the relationship with the adolescent was rated on a
5-point Likert-type scale. A higher rating reflected lower satisfac-
tion.
Data Analysis
Sample weights were not applied in these analyses because
fewer adopted than nonadopted subjects had been assigned
weight variables by the Add Health investigators (90.2% vs 94.6%;
P  .006). To decrease the likelihood of a type 1 error resulting
from the unweighted analyses, we set statistical significance con-
servatively at P  .01. Nonparametric test phi coefficients were
used as the measure of association for variables that violated
assumptions of normal distribution.
Three sets of univariate analyses were performed. In the first
set, adopted and nonadopted adolescents were compared on all
variables. In the second set, adolescents who did and did not
report suicide attempt(s) were compared. In the third set, adoptees
and nonadoptees who attempted suicide were compared.
Variables from the second set of analyses that were associated
with attempted suicide at P  .01 were entered into a forward
stepwise logistic regression procedure to identify those that were
independently associated with attempted suicide. Variables that
were associated with the log odds of attempted suicide at P  .05
were retained in the model. To enhance comparability of the
adjusted odds ratios, the continuous and ordinal variables in the
model were converted to dichotomous variables. The CES-D score
was dichotomized using Roberts' criteria, as described above.47
The self-image, delinquency, and family connectedness scores
were dichotomized as the highest tertile (low self-image, high
delinquency, high family connectedness) versus the lower 2 quar-
tiles. Cigarette use was dichotomized as levels 1 and 2 (never
smoked or never smoked a whole cigarette) versus levels 3 to 6.
The adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are re-
ported, and a receiver operating characteristic curve of the model
was drawn by plotting the sensitivity (true positive rate) and
1-specificity (false-positive rate) at different cutpoints in the prob-
ability estimation of attempted suicide. The area under the curve
was calculated as a measure of the overall performance of the
model.48,49
After the association of adoption with attempted suicide and its
independence of depression and aggression was demonstrated,
the potentially mediating effect of impulsivity was explored by
adding it to the model. The same procedure was followed for any
variable associated with adoption in either the full sample or
attempt subsample. To determine whether any variable in the final
model moderated the association between adoption and attempt,
we forced into the model the interaction term for that variable 
adoption.
RESULTS
Of the 6577 adolescents in the study sample, 214
(3.3%) lived with adoptive mothers and 6363 (96.7%)
lived with biological mothers. At least 1 suicide at-
tempt in the past year was reported by 213 (3.3%) of
the 6577 participants.
Adopted and nonadopted adolescents differed sig-
nificantly on 4 variables: attempted suicide, parental
education, family income, and mental health coun-
seling in the past year. Sixteen adopted adolescents
(7.6%) and 197 nonadopted adolescents (3.1%) re-
ported suicide attempt(s) in the past year (P  .001).
Mean parental education was 3.6  1.2 for the
adopted group and 3.2  1.2 for the nonadopted
group (P  .0001). Mean family income level was
3.1  1.2 for the adopted group and 2.7  1.1 for the
nonadopted group (P  .0001). At least 1 parent with
a professional degree was reported by 73 adoptive
mothers (34.1%) compared with 1238 biological
mothers (19.5%; P  .001). Household income in the
top 5% was reported by 21 adoptive mothers (9.8%)
compared with 295 biological mothers (4.6%; P 
.001). Counseling in the past year was reported by 36
adopted adolescents (16.9%) and 521 nonadopted
adolescents (8.2%; P  .001). There were no signifi-
cant differences between the adopted and non-
adopted groups on any other variables.
The univariate analyses comparing adolescents
who did and did not report suicide attempt(s) in the
past year are summarized in Tables 1 to 4. The
groups differed significantly on all variables except

4 of 8 ADOPTION AND ADOLESCENT SUICIDE ATTEMPTS
for age, race/ethnicity, parental education, family
income, and routine physical examination in the past
year. Adolescents who attempted suicide, compared
with those who did not, were more likely to be
female (67.6% vs 49.1%) and adopted (7.5% vs 3.1%).
They were more likely to rate their general health
status as fair or poor and to report that they had not
received needed medical care. Attempters had
higher CES-D scores, were more than 5 times as
likely to have scores consistent with depression, had
lower self-image, and reported more trouble relaxing
than did nonattempters. Attempters were more than
4 times as likely as nonattempters to have received
mental health counseling in the past year. They were
more likely to report all risk behaviors, including use
of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana; sexual inter-
course; aggression; impulsivity; and delinquency.
Attempters reported poorer school performance,
school connectedness, family connectedness, and pa-
rental presence than nonattempters. Mothers of at-
tempters were more likely to rate their adolescents as
bad-tempered and to report dissatisfaction with the
mother­adolescent relationship than were mothers
of nonattempters.
The 19 variables that were associated significantly
with suicide attempt in the past year were entered
into the forward stepwise logistic regression analy-
sis. Of the 9 variables that composed the final model
(Table 5), the following 8 increased the likelihood of
suicide attempt: depression, mental health counsel-
ing in the past year, female gender, cigarette use,
delinquency, adoption, low self-image, and aggres-
sion. One variable, high family connectedness, de-
creased the likelihood of attempted suicide. The re-
ceiver operating characteristic curve for the model,
shown in Fig 1, had an area under the curve of 0.834.
The addition of impulsivity, parental education,
and family income to the model did not change the

adjusted odds ratio of adoption. Comparison of
adoptees and nonadoptees who attempted suicide
revealed significant differences in only 2 variables,
CES-D score (P  .005) and self-esteem score (P 
.05), both of which were retained in the final model.
None of the interaction terms (adoption  another
risk factor) demonstrated a significant effect on the
logistic model.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study indicate that attempted
suicide is more common among adolescents who live
with adoptive parents than among adolescents who
live with biological parents. The study population
intentionally was limited to adolescents who were
living with their adoptive or biological mothers and
who had not been separated from their mothers for
longer than 6 months. Furthermore, because the par-
ticipants' mothers were in first-time marriages, it is
likely that most of the participants had not experi-
enced parental divorce and were living in 2-parent
households. The adopted and nonadopted groups
therefore were matched for 3 variables that have
confounded many studies of adopted youths: family
structure, parental divorce, and mother­child sepa-
ration. Other important aspects of adoption, such as
the child's age at which it occurred or whether the
adoptive parents were biologically related to the
child, were not included in the Add Health data set.
Variables such as these therefore remain key targets
for the future study of suicide attempts among
adopted youths.
The results of the current study support the pri-
mary hypothesis that adoption is associated with
attempted suicide but do not support the secondary
hypothesis that the association is mediated by im-
pulsivity. However, it is important to remember that
the Add Health survey did not include a validation
of impulsivity. The CES-D, which is a validated mea-
sure of depression, showed much better discrimina-
tion between participants who did and did not at-
tempt suicide than did the nonvalidated measures
for impulsivity and aggression. Perhaps in-depth in-
terviews designed to elicit self- and/or parent per-
ceptions of impulsive or aggressive behavior would
have yielded different results. Conversely, previous
studies indicated that depression is a stronger and
more consistent correlate of attempted suicide
among adolescents than is either impulsivity or ag-
gression.35,36,38,50­52
The study results do support the third hypothesis
that family connectedness decreases the risk of sui-
cidal behavior regardless of adolescent adoptive or
nonadoptive status. The association between family
connectedness and adolescent suicide attempt was
reported previously for the full Add Health sample,
which includes a broad array of family structures.40
The demonstration of its continued association in the
highly select subset analyzed in this study, as well as
its independence of adoptive or nonadoptive status,
emphasizes how important family connectedness is
to adolescent well-being. The finding is supported by
a 1997 study by Rosnati and Marta53 that showed
that it is the quality of the parent­adolescent rela-
tionship, rather than adoptive or nonadoptive status,
that predicts adolescent psychosocial risk. Family
function, defined and measured differently than the
Add Health construct of family connectedness, also
has been shown to be associated with adolescent
suicide attempt,54 other risk behaviors, and depres-
sion.55
In addition to depression, adoption, aggression,
and family connectedness, the following 5 factors
demonstrated independent associations with at-
tempted suicide in this study: mental health counsel-
ing in the past year, female gender, cigarette use,
delinquency, and low self-image. All have been re-
ported previously to increase the risk of suicide at-
tempt during adolescence. The rate of suicidal be-
havior is 3 times higher for adolescents who have
received previous outpatient mental health care and
7 times higher for adolescents who have received
inpatient care than for adolescents with no history of
care.56­60 The predominance of females compared
with males among adolescents who attempt suicide
is well documented and contrasts sharply with the
predominance of males who complete suicide during
mid- and late adolescence.61,62 However, data from
the 1999 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey of 9th-
to 12th-grade students indicate that race/ethnicity
may affect the association between suicide attempt
and gender. Rates of suicide attempt were signifi-
cantly higher among white non-Hispanic and His-
panic females than males but did not differ by gen-
der among black non-Hispanic students. Among all
racial/ethnic and grade-level subgroups, females

were more likely than males to report serious con-
sideration of suicide during the previous 12
months.61
Both cigarette use and delinquency have been as-
sociated with adolescent suicidal behavior, as well as
with mood disorders and substance abuse.38,54,55,63­69
The inclusion of cigarette smoking in the final model of
the current study, rather than alcohol or marijuana use,
was surprising given extensive evidence supporting
the role of substance abuse as an independent risk
factor for suicide attempt and completion during ado-
lescence. Although cigarette smoking in most studies
is associated with both suicide attempt and sub-
stance abuse, it seems to be a marker of risk rather
than an independent predictor of suicidal behav-
ior.50,51,62,63,70­73 The discrepancy in the findings of pre-
vious studies compared with the current study may
reflect the differences between the clinically derived
samples of previous studies and the school-based Add
Health sample of the current study. It is likely that the
severity of both suicidal behavior and substance abuse
is higher for adolescents who have a history of psychi-
atric inpatient and/or outpatient care than it is for
adolescents who are attending school and living at
home. It also is possible that the in-home setting of the
Add Health survey interfered with adolescent disclo-
sure of alcohol and other drug use.
Another discrepancy between the current and pre-
vious studies is the independent nature of the asso-
ciation between low self-image and suicide attempt.
Low self-image has been demonstrated to be a more
consistent association with suicidal ideation than
with suicide attempt,50,61,70,74 and it has not been
found to predict suicide attempt independent of
other variables. The persistent effect of low self-im-
age in this study, after adjustment for well-estab-
lished predictors of attempt such as depression, ag-
gression, impulsivity, and family factors, suggests
that the adolescents who reported attempt(s) in the
past year may have had ongoing suicidal ideation at
the time of the survey.
CONCLUSION
Suicide attempts are significantly more common
among adolescents who live with married adoptive
mothers than among adolescents who live with mar-
ried biological mothers. The association between
adoption and attempted suicide persists after adjust-
ing for depression and aggression and is not medi-
ated by impulsivity as measured by a self-reported
tendency to make decisions quickly. Although the
mechanism underlying the association remains un-
clear, adoptive status may help health care providers
to identify youths who are at risk and to intervene
before a suicide attempt occurs. It is equally impor-
tant to note, however, that the great majority of
adopted youths do not attempt suicide and that
adopted and nonadopted youths in this study did
not differ in other aspects of emotional and behav-
ioral health. Furthermore, high family connectedness
decreases the likelihood of suicide attempts regard-
less of adoptive status and represents a protective
factor for all adolescents.
