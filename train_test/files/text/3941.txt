Introduction
According to the social amplification of risk framework
(SARF), news media serve as an important "social amplifica-
tion station," intensifying signals about risks and risk events
(Burnsetal.,1993;Kasperson,1992;Kasperson&Kasperson,
1996; Kasperson et al., 1988; Pidgeon, Kasperson, & Slovic,
2003; Renn, 1991; Renn, Burns, Kasperson, Kasperson, &
Slovic, 1992). Lacking relevant personal experience with cer-
tain risks, individuals mainly learn about them from print and
electronic media--as well as other avenues, such as peer net-
works. Continued exposure to media coverage of risks and
risk events (especially featuring dramatized symbolic conno-
tations like "Terminator technology" or "Frankenfood") tend
to heighten laypeople's risk perceptions--irrespective of
technical risk assessments and expert viewpoints.
If media coverage of scientific and medical studies that
seemingly provide compelling evidence for significant tech-
nological and health risks tends to amplify public risk per-
ceptions, then what happens when further media coverage
criticizes those same studies as deeply flawed and even pub-
licizes that they have been retracted? Does such later media
coverage reverse or at least attenuate risk perceptions? Or,
once amplified, do risk perceptions stay elevated? While
SARF scholars intimate that it is often easier to increase con-
cern and stoke fears than it is to reduce them (Kasperson
et al., 1988), we simply lack much research to understand
these dynamics.
This knowledge gap is unfortunate given the recent rise in
scientific article retractions (Steen, Casadevall, & Fang,
2013; Van Noorden, 2011) and, more on point, the few high-
profile cases where eventually discredited and retracted peer-
reviewed studies on the health risks of childhood vaccines
(Wakefield et al., 1998) and genetically modified organisms
(GMOs; Séralini et al., 2012) seem to have inflated public
risk perceptions of these technologies. Indeed, often sensa-
tionalized media coverage, content sharing via social media,
and the claims-making activities of opponents of these tech-
nologies have amplified public worry about childhood vac-
cines (Largent, 2012) and GMOs (Stephan, 2015).
To extend SARF scholarship on the news media as a
social station of risk amplification (and attenuation) and to
examine how news coverage of scientific retractions may
influence risk perceptions, we focus on a recent case of the
retraction of a well-publicized scientific study that seems to
have amplified risk perceptions of GM food. The study
(Séralini et al., 2012) reported that rats fed GM corn devel-
oped tumors, heightening concern about the health effects of

The Effects of Media Coverage of
Scientific Retractions on Risk Perceptions
Dilshani Sarathchandra1 and Aaron M. McCright2
Abstract
Media coverage of scientific studies identifying technological risks generally amplifies public risk perceptions. Yet, if subsequent
media coverage reports that those studies have been retracted, are risk perceptions reversed or attenuated? Or, once
amplified, do risk perceptions remain elevated? Answering such questions may improve our understanding of risk perceptions
of some publicly controversial technologies, for example, childhood vaccines and genetically modified (GM) food. We engage
with the social amplification of risk framework, especially scholarship on news media as a risk amplification (or attenuation)
station. In a between-subjects experiment, we examine the extent to which perceived risk of GM food is influenced by (a)
news of a study reporting that eating GM food causes cancer and/or (b) news of its retraction. Whereas initial news coverage
amplified all measured risk perceptions, news of the study's retraction effectively reversed them to nonamplified levels.

GM food. Yet, many in the scientific community challenged
the rigor and veracity of this study, which then was retracted
from the Elsevier journal Food and Chemical Toxicology
(Elsevier, 2013). In a between-subjects messaging experi-
ment, we investigate the extent to which risk perceptions
about GM crops and food are influenced by (a) news cover-
age of this study and/or (b) news coverage of its retraction.
In the next section, we briefly review (a) the relevant
SARF scholarship on the news media as an amplification sta-
tion, (b) selected findings from GM food risk perception
studies, and (c) key aspects of our specific case study of the
retraction of Séralini et al. (2012). After describing our
experimental design and subjects, we explain the variables
and analytical techniques we employed in our study. We then
discuss our results and conclude with some potential impli-
cations of our findings for SARF scholarship and sugges-
tions for furthering this research agenda.
Relevant Literature and Background
The SARF
SARF is an integrative conceptual framework that combines
theoretical arguments and empirical findings from media
research, cultural scholarship, psychometric research, and
studies of organizational responses to risk (Kasperson,
Kasperson, Pidgeon, & Slovic, 2003). As it was first intro-
duced in 1988, SARF scholars have engaged in clarifying
and providing empirical support for the framework, for
example, by investigating how the framework applies to both
amplification and attenuation of risk (Kasperson &
Kasperson, 1996; Pidgeon et al., 2003). The framework pro-
vides a structural description of how various hazardous
events interact with psychological, social, institutional, and
cultural processes, leading to intensification or attenuation of
risk perceptions and related risk behaviors (Burns et al.,
1993; Kasperson, 1992; Kasperson & Kasperson, 1996;
Kasperson et al., 1988; Pidgeon et al., 2003; Renn, 1991;
Renn et al., 1992).
SARF explains how public reactions to risk often differ
from technical risk assessments. Some hazards and events
assessed by experts as relatively low-risk generate great
social attention (risk amplification), while other hazards and
events judged as higher risk generate much less social atten-
tion (risk attenuation; Kasperson et al., 2003; Kasperson
et al., 1988). According to SARF, amplification or attenua-
tion begins either with an event or awareness of a hazard
(Renn et al., 1992). The signals generated during such
events--which often combine facts, values, and symbolic
meanings--are intensified or attenuated during a signal
transmission process, as those signals pass through various
individual and social stations (Kasperson & Kasperson,
1996; Kasperson et al., 1988; Pidgeon et al., 2003).
This process leads to subsequent individual-level and
group-level behavioral responses, which in turn can lead to
broader societal impacts. Such impacts spread beyond those
who are directly affected by a risk experience (Kasperson &
Kasperson, 1996; Kasperson et al., 1988; Renn et al., 1992),
sometimes causing financial losses, regulatory action, litiga-
tion, organizational change, and loss of confidence in institu-
tions that govern risk (Kasperson et al., 1988). In the case of
GM food, broader societal impacts may include enduring
mental images and attitudes (e.g., anti-GM sentiments),
impacts on businesses and sales (e.g., aversion to GM food,
increased demand for organic produce), political and social
pressure (e.g., calls for labeling GM food, such as the 2014
Proposition 37 in California), contentious action (e.g., anti-
GM protests, destruction of GM agricultural land), and dis-
trust in science and scientists. As individuals and groups
continue to experience these broader societal impacts, the
effects may spread to distant locations and even future gen-
erations (Kasperson et al., 1988; Renn et al., 1992).
The News Media as a Social Station of
Amplification and Attenuation
In SARF, the news media is depicted as a key social station
of risk amplification and attenuation that influences public
perception of risk and likely behavioral responses (Burns
et al., 1993; Kasperson et al., 1988). The news media pro-
vides mental shortcuts for citizens who have little or no
experience with new technologies (Scheufele & Lewenstein,
2005). This is especially the case for technologies (such as
genetic engineering) that cannot be directly observed (Donk,
Metag, Kohring, & Marcinkowski, 2012).
As a social station of risk amplification, the news media
engages in several key amplification steps: filtering and
decoding of risk signals, processing risk information, and
attaching social values to the information (Kasperson et al.,
1988). These steps lead to transformation of risk signals,
which in turn increases or decreases the salience of certain
aspects of risk messages (Pidgeon et al., 2003). Typical
signal transformation processes include giving dispropor-
tionate, long-term attention to some risks while ignoring
others (Combs & Slovic, 1978; Freudenburg, Coleman,
Gonzales, & Helgeland, 1996; Mazur, 1984, 1990; McCabe
& Fitzgerald, 1991), vocalizing and legitimizing some points
of view more or less than others (Hornig, 1993), and drama-
tizing the nature of some risks but not others (Bauer, Kohring,
Gutteling, & Allansdottir, 2001; Johnson & Covello, 1987).
These different media responses play key roles in structuring
the overall public debate about risk events and hazards
(Hornig, 1993). Regardless of the accuracy of information
presented by the news media, large volumes of information
and/or repeated stories are known to mobilize latent fears
and serve as risk amplifiers (Kasperson et al., 1988). Also
important are the symbols, metaphors, and discourses used
to depict and characterize risk in the news media (Kasperson
& Kasperson, 1996). Indeed, including or excluding certain
Sarathchandra and McCright 3
cultural symbols (especially those with strong value implica-
tions) is one of the most powerful means of amplification or
attenuation of risk (Kasperson et al., 1988).
While empirical evidence demonstrates that exposure to
media coverage of hazards and technological risks does
amplify risk perceptions, it is unclear whether subsequent
media coverage downplaying the hazards and reassuring the
safety of the technology can counteract the effects of original
risk messages (Kasperson et al., 1988). Indeed, as the name
of the model implies, most SARF scholarship examines risk
amplification, while processes of risk attenuation are under-
investigated. Yet, the standing question is important. Do risk
perceptions, initially heightened through social amplification
processes, stay elevated in the face of later, well-publicized,
counterfactual evidence?
Scientific retractions provide us with an avenue to empiri-
cally examine this. While scientific retractions hold substan-
tial interest for the public and the media (Tobin, 2000), media
coverage of scientific retractions has not been the subject of
much investigation (Rada, 2007). Most empirical studies on
retractions focus on identifying why journals retract articles
and why the incidence of retractions has increased over time.
A few studies find that press releases for article retractions
do garner measurable levels of media attention (Rada, 2005,
2007) but also that the political agendas of journalists and
media outlets influence their coverage (Winsten, 1985).
While scholars obliquely discuss the potential implications
of retractions (such as reduced trust in science), we found no
empirical studies that have directly examined such claims.
We simply lack scholarship to explain how news coverage of
scientific retractions may affect public risk perceptions--or
public perceptions of science in general.
To fill these gaps in the literature and extend the SARF
scholarship on the news media as a social station of amplifi-
cation and attenuation, we examine how risk perceptions
are influenced by exposure to news coverage of a scientific
study and by exposure to news coverage of its retraction.
Specifically, we examine how perceived risks of GM food
are influenced by news coverage of the Séralini et al. (2012)
study--which reported that rats fed GM corn developed
tumors--and by news coverage of its later retraction. SARF
expects that exposure to news coverage of the original study
amplifies perceived risk of GM food. We propose that news
coverage of an article's retraction can affect amplified risk
perception in one of three ways, as depicted in Figure 1.
Proposition 1: Retraction news coverage has no effect on
amplified risk perception.
Proposition 2: Retraction news coverage attenuates
amplified risk perception.
Proposition 3: Retraction news coverage reverses the
amplification of risk perception.
GM Food Risk Perceptions
Since the mid-1990s, social scientists have investigated fac-
tors that influence public risk perceptions of GMOs. Much of
that includes publics in the United States or Western Europe.
While some scholars investigate overall perceived risk of
GMOs (Frewer, Miles, & Marsh, 2002; Gaivoronskaia &
Hvinden, 2006; Ganiere, Chern, & Hahn, 2006), others dis-
tinguish between perceived health risks of "GM food con-
sumption" and perceived environmental, regulatory, and
social risks of "GM crop cultivation" (Allum, 2007; Costa-
Font & Gil, 2008; Frewer, Howard, Hedderley, & Shepherd,
1999; Pidgeon et al., 2005).
Several of the patterns detected in GM food risk percep-
tion are consistent with those of the broader risk perception
literature; furthermore, such patterns correspond to the
amplification and attenuation mechanisms of SARF (Frewer
et al., 2002). Research finds that women express greater con-
cern about GM organisms and are less likely to approve of
GMOs for consumption than are men (Hallman, Hebden,
Aquino, Cuite, & Lang, 2003; Siegrist, 2000; Torgersen &
Figure 1. Possible effects of exposure to a study's retraction on amplified public risk perception.

Seifert, 1997). Level of education is positively associated
with perceived benefits of GM crops (Hallman et al., 2003;
Traill et al., 2004). Support for GM crops increases with
income (Torgersen & Seifert, 1997), but decreases with age
(Hallman et al., 2003; Torgersen & Seifert, 1997). Lack of
trust in scientists, governments, and regulatory agencies is
associated with heightened risk perceptions (Allum, 2007;
Costa-Font & Gil, 2008; Lang & Hallman, 2005; Poortinga
& Pidgeon, 2005; Siegrist, 2000).Also, variation in GM food
risk perceptions aligns with the intensity of media coverage
over time (Bauer et al., 2001; Frewer et al., 2002; Gutteling
et al., 2002; Vilella-Vila & Costa-Font, 2008).
The Séralini et al. Affair
The past few decades have seen a sharp increase in the per-
centage of scientific articles that are retracted (Steen et al.,
2013; Van Noorden, 2011). While most retractions of scien-
tific articles rarely register outside of the scientific commu-
nity, a few generate considerable media coverage and garner
public attention. Some prominent retractions that have cap-
tured considerable public attention in the recent past include
articles on the side effects of childhood vaccines (Wakefield
et al., 1998), the social cognition of nonhuman primates
(Hauser, Weiss, & Marcus, 2002), the creation of multipur-
pose stem cells (Hwang et al., 2004; Obokata et al., 2014), the
health risks of GM crops (Séralini et al., 2012), and change in
attitudes about same-sex marriage (LaCour & Green, 2014).
We chose to focus on the Séralini et al. (2012) study and
its retraction for two reasons. First, this study provides a
recent and timely case that has not yet garnered much social
scientific attention. Second, we anticipated that potential
participants would be less familiar with the Séralini et al.
affair than with earlier retractions (such as Wakefield et al.,
1998), thus reducing concerns about preexisting exposure.
The Séralini et al. study was first published in 2012 in the
journal Food and Chemical Toxicology. A research team led
by French molecular biologist Gilles-Eric Séralini reported
the results of an experiment in which researchers fed
Monsanto's Roundup-resistant GM corn and Roundup herbi-
cide to rats over their 2-year life span. The researchers found
that this GM corn and herbicide treatment produced higher
rates of cancer and premature death in rats in the experimen-
tal group than in those in the control group.
Upon publication, this study was heavily criticized by the
larger scientific community for its low methodological rigor
and limited statistical power (Butler, 2012). Some scientists
argued that the particular strain of rats used in the study is
prone to cancer even under normal conditions (Butler,
2012), a fact that had long been established (Suzuki, Mohr,
& Kimmerle, 1979). Several national food safety and regu-
latory organizations (e.g., European Food Safety Authority,
Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) ques-
tioned the validity of the study (Butler, 2012). Other groups,
such as the European Federation of Biotechnology lobby,
also questioned the legitimacy of the scientific peer-review
process (Butler, 2012).
In response to this intense criticism, Elsevier retracted the
article in November 2013. In its retraction notice, the editor
in chief stated that although there was no evidence of fraud
or intentional misrepresentation of data, the legitimacy of the
results was questionable due to the small sample size and the
breed of rats used. The editor in chief concluded that the
results presented were inconclusive and did not meet the
threshold for publication in Food and Chemical Toxicology
(Elsevier, 2013).1
The Study
Subjects
We administered an experiment online with Qualtrics to sub-
jects recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), a
crowdsourcing website where "requesters" solicit "workers"
to perform "human intelligence tasks" (HITs) for pay. AMT
has emerged as a practical way for recruiting a large number
of subjects from a reasonably wide cross section of the gen-
eral public either for conducting online experiments (e.g.,
Clements, McCright, Dietz, & Marquart-Pyatt, 2014) or for
designing and testing new measurement instruments (e.g.,
Allen, McCright, & Dietz, 2015) across the social sciences
(e.g., Goodman, Cryder, & Cheema, 2013; Levay, Freese, &
Druckman, 2016; Weinberg, Freese, & McElhattan, 2014).2
To solicit a broad cross section of research subjects and
minimize self-selection by AMT workers highly interested in
GMOs, we advertised a HIT titled "Your Attitudes About
Important Social Issues in the US." We limited participation
to adults residing in the United States. We paid subjects
US$0.50 for completing the experiment, which took, approxi-
mately, 7 min and 30 s on average. The final sample includes
those 423 subjects who completed the full questionnaire (of
the 439 who began it) during March 27 to 30, 2015 and who
correctly answered a comprehension check question and a
manipulation check question.3 These correct answers and the
average completion time indicate that subjects had an ade-
quate level of attentiveness during the experiment. Our con-
veniencesampleismoredemographically,socially,politically,
and geographically diverse than are the traditional experi-
ment recruitment pools of university undergraduates, yet it
also is more male, younger, more highly educated, and more
liberal than would be a representative sample of the U.S. gen-
eral public. As such, the external validity of our results is
likely higher than if we had simply recruited university under-
graduates, but it is also likely lower than if we had drawn a
nationally representative sample.
The Experiment
Our experiment had three experimental conditions and a
control condition. To achieve reasonable equivalence of
Sarathchandra and McCright 5
cognitive engagement across the four conditions, all subjects
read news coverage of a scientific study conducted by a team
of French scientists. As we discuss below, the topic of the
scientific study in the control condition was a potential func-
tional cure for HIV, while the topic of the scientific study in
the experimental conditions was potential health risks of
consuming GM food. We aimed to optimize external validity
by explicitly creating a factual narrative reconstructed from
actual news coverage, and we aimed to optimize internal
validity by designing mock news stories with similar formats
and lengths.
Even though some news coverage of scientific research
is rather sensationalized (especially that of research on pub-
licly controversial topics, such as GM food), we intention-
ally chose to craft fact-laden news stories that avoided
obvious hype and provocation. We primarily did this to
guard against unintentionally including persuasive ele-
ments that would unduly bolster message strength and sur-
reptitiously inflate experimental effects--which would not
be reproduced in other contexts or outside of experimental
settings. As such, the resulting messages likely underesti-
mate the influence that actual news coverage of this type
has on risk perceptions. Pages 2 to 5 in the Supplementary
Materials contain the news stories presented to the subjects
in each of the four conditions.
Subjects in the control condition read a brief news story,
titled "Study Raises Hope for a `Functional Cure' for HIV,"
about an actual study first publicized in early August 2012--
around the time of the Séralini et al. study. Subjects in the
first experimental condition read a brief news story, titled
"Study Reveals Rats Fed GM-Corn Develop Tumors," that
described the findings of the Séralini et al. study, which was
first publicized in mid-September 2012. Subjects in the sec-
ond experimental condition read the brief news story from
the previous condition and another one, titled "Controversial
GM-Corn Study by French Scientists Retracted," that
described the limitations of the study, the negative reaction it
received within the scientific community, and its eventual
retraction--which was first publicized in late November
2013. Subjects in the last experimental condition only
received the news story about the Séralini et al. retraction.
After providing their consent to participate in our study,
subjects were randomly assigned to one of the four condi-
tions above. Pages 6 to 8 in the Supplementary Materials
contain the full experimental questionnaire. After reading
their assigned news story, subjects answered two open-
ended questions: one comprehension check and one manip-
ulation check. On the next page, subjects answered several
sets of questions about their risk perceptions, policy prefer-
ences, and behavioral intentions about food from GM
crops. On a subsequent page, subjects answered a set of
conventional questions about their demographic, social,
and political characteristics. On the final page, we thanked
subjects for their participation and debriefed them about
our research question.
Variables
Table SM1 on page 9 in the Supplementary Materials dis-
plays key information about the wording and coding of the
items we used to create the three composite outcome vari-
ables in our analyses. Informed by the relevant literature, our
three outcome variables measure perceived risk of GM food
in general, perceived risk of growing and harvesting GM
crops, and perceived risk of consuming GM food.
Relative perceived risk of GM food is a ratio of the per-
ceived riskiness (not risky at all = 1 to extremely risky = 7) of
GM food to the average perceived riskiness of four mundane
technologies: chainsaws, elevators, medical X-rays, and
microwave ovens.4 This relative measure helps to account
for and neutralize general tendencies toward risk aversion or
risk acceptance, helping us more precisely gauge perceived
risk of GM food.5 This variable ranges between 0.22 and
2.80 with a mean of 1.00.
For our other two outcome variables (perceived danger-
ousness of GM crops and perceived dangerousness of GM
food), we used Cronbach's alpha scores and the results of a
principal components analysis (PCA) with Promax rotation
with Kaiser normalization to justify creating two scales
(Table SM2 on page 10 in the Supplementary Materials pres-
ents the PCA results). Perceived dangerousness of GM crops
(Cronbach's  = .94) is a five-item scale that measures the
average perceived dangerousness (not dangerous at all = 1 to
extremely dangerous = 7) that the growing and harvesting of
GM crops poses for the following: farmers and farm-work-
ers, farm livestock (e.g., cows, pigs, etc.), pollinator insects
(e.g., butterflies, bees, etc.), wild animals (e.g., deer, birds,
etc.), and local groundwater quality. Perceived dangerous-
ness of GM food (Cronbach's  = .97) is a four-item scale
that measures the average perceived dangerousness (not dan-
gerous at all = 1 to extremely dangerous = 7) of the following
four behaviors: eating raw GM fruit or vegetables, eating
cooked GM fruit or vegetables, eating processed food made
from GM fruit or vegetables, and using GM food (e.g., veg-
etable oil) in the baking or cooking process.
Our key predictors are two dummy variables, exposed to
news about study and exposed to news about retraction, that
represent whether or not subjects were exposed to the initial
news coverage of the Séralini et al. study or the later news
coverage of its retraction, respectively. To fully capture the
effect of being exposed both to the news about the study and
to the news about the retraction, we created an interaction
term using centered scores (mean ­ value): Exposed to news
about study × Exposed to news about retraction. Utilizing a
higher order (e.g., interaction) term in a regression model
often leads to multicollinearity problems. As our interaction
term is based on centered scores, it has a different scale than
do the original variables; thus, these multicollinearity prob-
lems are reduced (e.g., Aiken, West, & Reno, 1991).
We also employ four demographic, social, and political
variables as statistical controls in our analyses. Female is a
6 SAGE Open
dummy variable for sex: male = 0 and female = 1. Slightly
more than 60% of our subjects were male. Age is measured
with seven categories: 18-19 = 1 to 70 or older = 7.
Approximately, 75% of our subjects were aged younger than
40 years. Education is measured by the highest degree earned:
less than high school diploma or equivalent = 1 to graduate/
professional degree = 6. Approximately, 55% of our subjects
had a bachelor's degree. Political ideology is measured on a
7-point scale from very conservative = 1 to very liberal = 7,
with moderate = 4 in the middle. Approximately, 55% of our
subjects identified as slightly to very liberal.
Analytical Techniques
After inspecting the descriptive statistics for each of our out-
come, independent, and control variables, we employed ordi-
nary least squares (OLS) regression analyses to examine the
extent to which exposure to news coverage of the Séralini
et al. study and its retraction have an influence on the three
outcome variables, while controlling for four demographic,
social, and political variables. We performed all of our analy-
ses with IBM SPSS 24.
Results
Table 1 presents the unstandardized coefficients and standard
errors from OLS regression models predicting each of our
three outcome variables. The magnitudes of the statistically
significant effects of key theoretical variables are not large,
and the total amount of variance explained across the models
is low. Yet, as we are investigating the influence of a single
exposure to brief and intentionally weak experimental mes-
sages, we believe that these small effect sizes nevertheless
are substantively compelling.
To fully capture the effects of exposure to news coverage
of the Séralini et al. study and/or news coverage of its retrac-
tion, we must account for the influence of the two experi-
mental dummy variables and their interaction term. We do
this by calculating the predicted values of the three outcome
variables when exposed to news about study is 0 or 1 and
when exposed to news about retraction is 0 or 1, while hold-
ing the demographic, social, and political variables at their
means.
Figure 2 displays these predicted values from the OLS
regression models in Table 1 for those subjects who were
exposed neither to the study story nor the retraction story
(white bars), subjects exposed only to the study story (red
bars), and subjects exposed both to the study story and retrac-
tion story (green bars). The error bars represent 95% confi-
dence intervals to clearly indicate statistically significant
differences across predicted values. The results in Figure 2
offer a cross-sectional between-subjects parallel of the longi-
tudinal within-subjects models displayed in Figure 1.
The results in Figure 2 are relatively clear and fairly
consistent across the three risk perception outcome
variables. Subjects exposed to news coverage of the
Séralini et al. study perceive greater risk of GM food rela-
tive to that of four mundane technologies, greater danger-
ousness of GM crops, and greater dangerousness of GM
food than do subjects who did not receive this experimen-
tal message. These effects on risk perceptions from a sin-
gle dose of a value-neutral mock news story provide
moderate support for SARF, which characterizes the news
media as a key risk amplification station.
Does exposure to news coverage of the study and of its
retraction have no effect on (Proposition 1), attenuate
(Proposition 2), or reverse (Proposition 3) risk percep-
tions amplified by news coverage of the study alone? The
patterns displayed in Figure 2 offer clear and consistent
support for Proposition 3. For each risk perception out-
come variable, subjects exposed to news stories about the
study and its retraction reported risk perceptions (a) sig-
nificantly lower than those of the group who received
only the study story and (b) statistically indistinguishable
from those of the control group who received neither
news story.
Finally, consistent with much research in the risk per-
ception literature, gender has a statistically significant
effect on all three risk perception measures. Females per-
ceive GM food and GM crops to be riskier and more dan-
gerous than do their male counterparts. Also, age and
educational attainment have a statistically significant effect
on the last two risk perception measures. Briefly, older
adults and lesser educated adults perceive GM crops and
GM food to be more dangerous than do their respective
counterparts. Political ideology is not associated with per-
ceived risks of GM crops or GM food.

Discussion and Conclusion
We administered a between-subjects messaging experiment
to investigate how risk perceptions of GM food are influ-
enced by exposure to news coverage of a scientific study
highlighting significant GM food risks and/or news cover-
age of the study's retraction. We found that news coverage
of a scientific study's retraction consistently reversed
amplified risk perceptions, regardless of the specific risk
perception measure. Briefly, exposure to retraction news
coverage reversed relative perceived risk of GM food, per-
ceived dangerousness of GM crops, and perceived danger-
ousness of GM food.
Our study fills a crucial gap in SARF research, which
has been criticized for predominantly characterizing the
news media as a "social station of amplification" and only
occasionally considering it as a "social station of attenua-
tion." Our empirical analysis overcomes this criticism by
examining both amplification and attenuation processes
simultaneously. Also, our study is particularly timely due
to the recent rise in scientific article retractions (Steen
et al., 2013; Van Noorden, 2011) and coverage of high-
profile cases where eventually discredited and retracted
peer-reviewed studies seem to have stoked public risk per-
ceptions of certain technologies, causing long-term soci-
etal impacts.
While the rate of scientific article retractions and their
subsequent news coverage have increased over the past few
decades, scholars have been slow to investigate how such
retraction news coverage may affect public perceptions
and/or behaviors. Yet, many important questions remain.
For instance, does the influence of retraction news cover-
age on risk perceptions depend upon the reason for the
retraction (e.g., honest mistakes vs. intentional misconduct;
Steen et al., 2013)? Also, is the effect of retraction news
coverage on risk perceptions influenced by how polarized
public attitudes are on the technological or scientific devel-
opment in question? Furthermore, to what extent does
retraction news coverage produce broader impacts or "rip-
ple effects" (e.g., increased distrust in science) and how
might these effects vary across different demographic,
social, and political groups?
Beyond the SARF literature, our findings also carry
implications for the larger scientific community and for
those involved in science communication.As our results sug-
gest that exposure to retraction news coverage affects public
perception of scientific and technological developments,
journal editors, publishers, and journalists should be more
cognizant of such potential effects when reporting retrac-
tions. Clarifying the reason for a retraction (e.g., honest mis-
takes vs. intentional misconduct) likely may influence how
journalists cover the story and how the public perceives the
development. Furthermore, if such a distinction helps to des-
tigmatize retractions due to honest mistakes, then scientists
may be more likely to admit their own mistakes--which, in
turn, may lead to rectification of the scientific record through
"self-correction" (Grens, 2015).
Beyond this, science writers may more actively educate
the general public about the peer-review process, helping
to increase scientific literacy throughout society. A more
scientifically informed public would be better able to
engage in a nuanced assessment of science news, including
the causes and implications of retractions to science and
society. Although fraudulent research and retractions rep-
resent only a small fraction of all scientific publications,
the potential decline in public trust of science that may
result from increased awareness of these wrongdoings
is troubling. This situation demands a concerted effort by

authors, editors, publishers, funding agencies, and journal-
ists to manage these risks.
We end by outlining the limitations of our single study
and identifying further avenues to move this emerging
scholarship forward. First, our study examined data from a
convenience sample, which is typical of many social sci-
ence experiments. While random assignment satisfies many
concerns about internal validity, atypical samples may limit
the degree to which findings should be generalized. If
future studies examine data from high-quality representa-
tive samples, scholars not only could reasonably estimate
population characteristics but also would increase the
external validity of results about the effectiveness of differ-
ent experimental messages and messengers on risk percep-
tions across the general public.
Second, scholars also may examine a range of message
and/or messenger characteristics. For instance, how does the
inclusion of editorial or value-laden content (e.g., perhaps
denouncing the credibility of the retracted article's authors or
intimating that the retraction does not discount the technol-
ogy's riskiness) influence the predictive power of message
exposure? Also, how do different messengers' identities
influence the impact of the message? For instance, how does
it matter if the messenger is a trusted scientist or science
communicator versus a well-known advocate for or oppo-
nent of the technology?
Third, scholars may investigate how the potential amplifi-
cation and attenuation effects of media coverage of scientific
articles and their retractions vary across types of traditional
media (e.g., newspapers, television, radio) and newer social
media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). While traditional
news outlets operate via journalistic norms that regularly
help produce generally accurate and reliable coverage of sci-
entific topics, the relative normlessness of social media plat-
forms produces a mélange of credible scientific knowledge,
intentional misinformation, and benign ignorance. It seems
reasonable to expect that a newspaper article about a scien-
tific retraction may be judged as more trustworthy than
would a Facebook post about that same retraction. Yet, opt-
ing into communication networks on social media tends to
produce self-contained "echo chambers" ripe for perpetuat-
ing motivated cognition (e.g., Colleoni, Rozza, & Arvidsson,
2014). Thus, exposure to social media posts about a scien-
tific study and/or its retraction may be more impactful than
newspaper coverage.
Fourth, while we employed a cross-sectional between-sub-
jects design in this initial study, we recommend that at least
some follow-up studies employ a longitudinal within-subjects
design. The latter allows for investigation of possible changes
in individuals' risk perceptions over time. Indeed, scholars
may include the time dimension (the length of time between
exposure to news coverage of the scientific study and expo-
sure to news coverage of its retraction) as an experimental
condition. This is particularly salient as there often is a
considerable time lag between the publication of a scientific
article and its subsequent retraction. Fifth, additional research
should aim to replicate this study to more completely assess
the consistency and generalizability of our results. For
instance, future research could explore a wider array of estab-
lished technologies (e.g., childhood vaccines) and emerging
technologies (e.g., multipurpose stem cells) that have experi-
enced high-profile retractions in recent years.

Notes
1. Séralini and his research team (2013) strongly objected to the
retraction. A few scientists criticized the journal's decision to
retract the study, arguing that this decision sets a problematic
precedent for the use of "inconclusive data" as a reason for retrac-
tion (Portier, Goldman, & Goldstein, 2014). In June 2014, the
Séralini et al. article was republished in Environmental Sciences
Europe (Séralini et al., 2014) with minor wording changes and
without further peer review (Casassus, 2014; Grens, 2014).
2. WhileAmazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and similar platforms
for crowdsourcing participation in scientific research are less
than a decade old, analyses suggest that the quality of data
from such sources is similar to, or even slightly better than,
the quality of data from professionally managed online pan-
els (Paolacci, Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010; Weinberg, Freese,
& McElhattan, 2014). All subject recruitment methods have
trade-offs (e.g., the representativeness of samples, timeliness
and cost of data collection, and data quality). Scholars may
address those weaknesses specific to subject recruitment with
AMT by careful experimental design (Paolacci et al., 2010),
transparency about the study materials, and use of tools for
recruiting subjects who are attentive and/or provide higher
quality responses (Paolacci & Chandler, 2014).
3. The open-ended comprehension check question assessed
whether subjects could accurately summarize the main point
of their assigned news story. The open-ended manipulation
check question assessed whether subjects understood the sci-
entific community's overall reception of the study as largely
positive or negative.
4. Cronbach's alpha for these four items was .71.
5. Many risk perception studies over the last three decades docu-
ment that some social groups are more risk averse than others--
regardless of whether the studies focus on risks in technological,
public health, or environmental domains. Our preliminary anal-
yses find that perceived risk of each of the five technologies we
used to create our relative risk measure is positively related to
all others. All 10 bivariate correlations in the correlation matrix
for these five technologies are statistically significant and vary
from r = .14 and r = .72, with an average of r = .36. We were
concerned that a simple, direct indicator of perceived risk of
Sarathchandra and McCright 9
genetically modified (GM) food (e.g., how risky is GM food?)
would merely tap this general tendency rather than more pre-
cisely measuring perceived risk about GM food. The results of
preliminary analyses using this simple, direct indicator as our
dependent variable validated this concern. That is, females,
older adults, and lesser educated adults perceive GM food as
riskier than their respective male, younger, and higher educated
counterparts--replicating patterns found widely across the risk
perceptions literature. To address this, we selected four com-
monplace technologies that have been examined in the risk per-
ception literature. We then created our composite measure (of
the perceived risk of GM food relative to the perceived risk of
these four technologies) to more fully distinguish perceived risk
of GM from perceived risk more broadly.
