Prevalence of Coronary Heart Disease
Risk Factors and Screening for High
Cholesterol Levels Among Young Adults,
United States, 1999­2006
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Previous studies have reported low rates of screening for high choles-
terol levels among young adults in the United States. Although recommenda-
tions for screening young adults without risk factors for coronary heart disease
(CHD) differ, all guidelines recommend screening adults with CHD, CHD equiva-
lents, or 1 or more CHD risk factors. This study examined national prevalence
of CHD risk factors and compliance with the cholesterol screening guidelines
among young adults.
METHODS National estimates were obtained using results for 2,587 young adults
(men aged 20 to 35 years; women aged 20 to 45 years) from the 1999­2006
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We defined high low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as levels higher than the goal specific for each
CHD risk category outlined in the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
Treatment Panel III guidelines.
RESULTS About 59% of young adults had CHD or CHD equivalents, or 1 or more
of the following CHD risk factors: family history of early CHD, smoking, hyper-
tension, or obesity. In our study, the overall screening rate in this population was
less than 50%. Moreover, no significant difference in screening rates between
young adults with no risk factors and their counterparts with 1 or more risk fac-
tors was found even after adjustment for sociodemographic and health care fac-
tors. Approximately 65% of young adults with CHD or CHD equivalents, 26% of
young adults with 2 or more risk factors, 12% of young adults with 1 risk factor,
and 7% with no risk factor had a high level of LDL-C.
CONCLUSIONS CHD risk factors are common in young adults but do not appear
to alter screening rates. Improvement of risk assessment and management for
cardiovascular disease among young adults is warranted.

INTRODUCTION
An abnormal lipid profile is a highly common but modifiable risk fac-
tor for coronary heart disease (CHD), a leading cause of mortality
in the United States. The importance of screening for identifica-
tion and clinical management of dyslipidemia is recognized by several
professional associations and public health organizations.1,2 The National
Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP
III), endorsed by the American Heart Association and the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute, recommends universal screening for high cho-
lesterol levels beginning at age 20 years.2 The US Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTF) advocates a targeted cholesterol screening approach
for young adults (men aged 20 to 35 years and women aged 20 to

CHD RISK FAC TORS AND CHOLESTEROL SCREENING
45 years). The USPSTF recommends screening young
adults with CHD, CHD equivalents (other forms of
atherosclerotic vascular disease, diabetes, or CHD risk
of 20% or greater within 10 years), or 1 or more CHD
risk factors (high blood pressure, smoking, family his-
tory, and obesity).1 There are no specific USPSTF rec-
ommendations for persons who do not have CHD risk
factors. Thus although screening guidelines vary, there
is agreement concerning the need to screen young
adults who are at increased risk of CHD.
Previous reports based on the Behavioral Risk Fac-
tor Surveillance System data indicated a low screening
rate among young adults. In 2003 only about 60% of
US adults aged 20 to 44 years had had their choles-
terol levels checked in the preceding 5 years, com-
pared with 85% and 89% of adults aged 45 to 64 years
and 65 years and older, respectively.3 Although the
use of drug therapy to treat high levels of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may be indicated
in a small proportion of young adults, therapeutic
lifestyle changes would be sufficient to manage high
LDL-C among most young adults.2 Data on compli-
ance with cholesterol-screening guidelines among
young adults and the prevalence of high LDL-C are
scarce, however. This study, which relied on data for
1999 to 2006 from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) of young adults (men
aged 20 to 35 years and women aged 20 to 45 years),
had 3 objectives to determine: (1) the proportion of
persons with CHD, CHD equivalents, or CHD risk
factors; (2) rates of the self-reported screening for high
cholesterol levels that had been performed before the
study; and (3) the prevalence of high LDL-C levels
that had been assessed by a fasting lipid testing during
the NHANES.
METHODS
Study Participants
NHANES is a continuous survey of the health and
nutritional status of the US civilian, noninstitutional-
ized population; participants are selected through a
complex, multistage probability design.4 Each year,
approximately 6,000 participants are selected to par-
ticipate in the study. Persons who agree to participate
are first interviewed in their homes about their health,
disease history, and diet. All interviewed participants
are invited to a local Mobile Exam Center for adminis-
tration of additional questionnaires, physical examina-
tions, and laboratory tests. NHANES data are released
in 2-year increments; the present analysis was con-
ducted with data from the 4 most recent study cycles:
1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006.
The overall response rates for completed examinations
among all screened participants for the study cycles
were 76% (9,282 of 12,160), 80% (10,477 of 13,156),
76% (9,643 of 12,761), and 77% (9,950 of 12,862),
respectively. In this study, to increase the sample size
and analytic options, data from the 4 study cycles were
combined into 1 data set.
Among 39,352 participants invited to the Mobile
Exam Center, 13,875 were randomly selected to fast 8
or more hours (up to 24 hours) for laboratory testing.
As did the other subsamples, the fasting subsample has
its own designated weight, which takes into account
the complex survey design, survey nonresponse, and
poststratification in representing the US civilian, non-
institutionalized census population. After exclusion of
10,663 participants aged younger than 20 years, men
35 years or older, or women 45 years or older, our
study sample consisted of 3,212 participants. Women
who had a positive urine pregnancy test or who
reported that they were pregnant (n=462), as well as
participants with missing lipid profile data or blood
pressure data (n=163), were excluded, leaving an ana-
lytical sample of 2,587 participants.
Assessment of CHD Risk Factors
Participants with a self-reported history of CHD
(angina or myocardial infarction) were identified as
participants with CHD. Those participants with self-
reported stroke or diabetes and those with fasting
blood glucose levels of 126 mg/dL or higher were iden-
tified as participants with CHD equivalents.
We examined the following 4 CHD risk factors
that according to the USPSTF guidelines should be
used to determine the eligibility for cholesterol screen-
ing in young adults: (1) cigarette smoking (self-reported
smoking every day or some days); (2) hypertension
(the average of 3 blood pressure measurements from
the NHANES physical examination at or exceeding
140/90 mm Hg, or self-reported current use of antihy-
pertensive medication); (3) family history of premature
CHD (angina or myocardial infarction) in a first-
degree relative younger than 50 years; and (4) obesity
(a body mass index of 30 or greater that was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the
height in meters).
Assessment and Definition of Screening Status
The cholesterol screening rates were estimated based
on the self-reported screening that took place before
our study. Participants were asked whether they had
ever had their blood cholesterol levels checked and
how long it had been since their last cholesterol
test. Screening was dichotomized as either (1) never
screened or screened 5 or more years ago or (2)
screened within the last 5 years.

CHD RISK FAC TORS AND CHOLESTEROL SCREENING
Lipid Measurements
and Definition of High
LDL-C Levels
We categorized LDL-C levels
based on the ATP III risk catego-
ries and goals for therapeutic life-
style changes and drug therapy
(Table 1), and we defined high
LDL-C levels as levels above the
goal for each risk category. The
group of participants with high
LDL-C levels included those who
were eligible for therapeutic life-
style change and drug therapy.
Details on the classification of
the study participants into the
3 ATP III risk categories (high,
intermediate, and low) are pub-
lished elsewhere.5
For all lipid analyses, fro-
zen venous serum samples were
shipped on dry ice to the Lipo-
protein Analytical Laboratory
at the Johns Hopkins University
Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.6
Methods for determining total
cholesterol, high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels for
1999-2006 NHANES surveys have been described else-
where.5 LDL-C values were calculated from measured
values of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-C
according to the Friedewald calculation. All lipid mea-
surements were standardized through the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention­National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute Lipid Standardization Program.7
Assessment and Definition of
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Information on race/ethnicity, health insurance cov-
erage, education, income, and health care visits was
obtained by using a structured questionnaire. Race/
ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican American, and others. The
others group included multiple race and other Hispanic.
Because the sample was designed to provide estimates
for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexi-
can American populations of the United States, we
included the others group in the analysis but did not
report estimates for this group because of its small sam-
ple size, heterogeneity, and nonrepresentative nature.
Participants were classified as insured if they
reported having private insurance, Medicaid, or Civil-
ian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed
Services (CHAMPUS)/Veterans Affairs insurance. The
poverty index ratio (total family income divided by
the poverty threshold index adjusted for family size,
composition, and location at year of interview) was
categorized numerically according to the following
descriptions: low (1 or less: family income is less than
or equal to the poverty threshold index), medium (2 to
3: family income is 2 to 3 times as high as the poverty
threshold index); and high (more than 3: family income
is more than 3 times as high as the poverty threshold
index). Health care access was assessed by responses to
the question, "During the past 12 months, how many
times have you seen a doctor or other health care pro-
fessional about your health at a doctor's office, a clinic,
hospital emergency room, at home or some other
place?" Participants' responses were grouped into 4 cat-
egories: 0, 1, 2 to 3, and 4 or more times.
Data Analysis
Estimated population prevalence and standard errors
were calculated using SUDAAN statistical software
to account for nonresponse and the complex sampling
design.8 The significance of a difference in preva-
lence was assessed by 2 test.8 Adjustment for multiple
comparisons was made using the Bonferroni method.9
Orthogonal polynomial coefficients that are calculated
recursively according to the method of Fisher and
Yates were used for testing linear trends.8

a Persons at high risk or moderately high risk who have lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical
inactivity, elevated triglyceride level, low HDL-C level, or metabolic syndrome) are candidates for therapeutic
lifestyle changes to modify these risk factors regardless of LDL-C level.
b LDL-C lowering drug therapy, when given, should be sufficient to reduce LDL-C levels 30%-40%.
c CHD includes history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stable angina, coronary artery procedures
(angioplasty or bypass surgery), or evidence of clinically significant myocardial ischemia.
d CHD equivalents include clinical manifestations of noncoronary forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral
arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and carotid artery disease, such as transient ischemic attacks or
stroke of carotid origin or >50% obstruction of a carotid artery), diabetes, and 2 risk factors with a 10-year
risk for hard CHD >20%.
e CHD risk factors include cigarette smoking, hypertension (blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg or taking antihy-
pertensive medication), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<40 mg/dL), family history of premature CHD
(CHD in male first-degree relative aged <55 years; CHD in female first-degree relative aged <65 years), and
age (men 45 years; women 55 years). Electronic 10-year risk calculators are available at http://www.nhlbi.
nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol.
f Almost all persons with 1 risk factor have a 10-year risk <10%; thus, a 10-year risk assessment is unnecessary.

CHD RISK FAC TORS AND CHOLESTEROL SCREENING
Because the prevalence of screening was less than
50%, Cox regression was used to calculate prevalence
proportion ratios and their 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) to examine the association between screening
and the predictors. Although Cox regression is used
to estimate the cumulative incidence ratio for longitu-
dinal data, it also can be used to estimate the preva-
lence proportion ratio for cross-sectional data when
a risk period is constant (each observation has equal
follow-up time).10
RESULTS
Table 2 shows the distribution of sociodemographic
characteristics and risk categories in the population of
interest. About 82% of the population had at least a
high school education, 85% had an income above the
poverty level, 73% had medical insurance, and 78%
had accessed health care during the last 12 months.
About 60% of the population had 1 or more CHD risk
factors. A higher proportion of women had medical
insurance (79% vs 65%, P <.05) and received health
care 1 or more times during the last 12 months (87%
vs 65%, P <.05) when compared with men. The preva-
lence of risk factors and NCEP ATP III risk categories
was similar among women and men, except for obesity
(31% vs 24%, respectively, P <.05).
Table 3 displays the rate of cholesterol screening
by risk categories. Although the rate of screening for
high cholesterol levels among persons without CHD

CHD RISK FAC TORS AND CHOLESTEROL SCREENING
or a CHD equivalent was higher among women than
among men (49%-53% vs 30%-38%, respectively),
no significant difference in screening for cholesterol
was observed among persons with 1 or 2 or more risk
factors for CHD compared with persons with no risk
factors in both sexes. The rate of screening for high
cholesterol levels among persons with CHD or a CHD
equivalent was less than 70% but was significantly
higher than the screening rate for persons with no risk
factors. Adjustment for sociodemographic characteris-
tics in multivariate Cox regression models had only a
small effect on screening rates by number of CHD risk
factors regardless of sex.
Table 4 shows the prevalence of high LDL-C levels.
Prevalence increased with the number of the CHD
risk factors; 6.7% of persons with no risk factors had
high LDL-C levels compared with 25.9% of those
with 2 or more risk factors. The highest prevalence of
high LDL-C levels (65.1%) was found among persons
with CHD or a CHD equivalent. The prevalence of
high LDL-C levels among young adults without CHD
risk factors was 10.1% and 4.6% for men and women,
respectively. Similar to the cholesterol screening,
adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics in
multivariate Cox regression models had only a small
effect on prevalence of high LDL-C levels by number
of CHD risk factors regardless of sex.
DISCUSSION
According to 1999-2006 NHANES data, approxi-
mately 65% of young adults with CHD or a CHD
equivalent, 26% of young adults with 2 or more risk
factors, 12% of young adults with 1 risk factor, and
7% with no CHD risk factors had a high LDL-C level.
Screening, however, for high blood cholesterol levels
in young adults, except for persons with CHD or a
CHD equivalent, was low: about 50% for women and
less than 40% for men. The age and sex disparities
in the use of preventive services have been reported
before. For example, the screening rate increases as a
function of age at the population level,11 and younger
men are significantly less likely than younger women
to receive certain preventive services.12 In our study,
no significant difference was found in screening rates

CHD RISK FAC TORS AND CHOLESTEROL SCREENING
between young adults with no risk factors and their
counterparts with 1 or more risk factors even after
adjustment for sociodemographic and health care fac-
tors. Because the severity of atherosclerosis in young
adults increases with the number of risk factors,13-15 the
low screening rates, particularly among young persons
with 2 or more risk factors, are of concern. A tendency
for more ambulatory care visits has been proposed
as a factor explaining higher screening rates among
young women than among young men.12 The efficiency
of population-based approaches in the prevention of
CHD is not well studied.16 The American Heart Asso-
ciation (AHA) supports public screenings that "meet
acceptable criteria for recruitment, reliability of mea-
surement of cholesterol levels, appropriate educational
information, properly trained staff and referral." The
AHA recognized that small-scale screening at work
sites, schools, churches, community centers, or neigh-
borhood clinics have potential for identifying high-
risk individuals. The AHA states, however, that the
integration of community screening programs into the
medical care system is important to ensure test results
interpretation and follow-up by the physician responsi-
ble for the patient's care.17 Future studies are needed to
identify how cholesterol screening among young adults
can be improved in primary care settings.
In our study, about 59% of young adults as defined
by NCEP screening guidelines (men aged 20 to 35
years and women aged 20 to 45 years) had CHD, a
CHD equivalent, or 1 or more of the following risk
factors: family history of early CHD, smoking, hyper-
tension, or obesity. Our results also support the need
to improve assessment and management of cardiovas-
cular disease risk factors among young adults. Because
therapeutic lifestyle changes are indicated more often
than is drug therapy for young adults, clinical manage-
ment of risk factors in this group may be challenging.
Health care clinicians perceive limited time, lack of
skills, inadequate reimbursement, and difficulties in
patient adherence to lifestyle changes as barriers to
effective counseling.18
These concerns notwithstanding, preventive efforts
focused on decreasing the number of CHD risk fac-
tors may be essential for preventing CHD later in life
and reducing the burden of CHD at the national level.
Indeed, as has been shown by results from NHANES
III among white, non-Hispanic persons aged 35 to 74
years, only a small proportion of CHD events (about
10%) occur among persons with isolated risk fac-
tors and LDL-C levels at which drug therapy is not
indicated.19 Thus, the American Medical Association
(AMA) promotes counseling on health behavior in
clinical practice by advocating full insurance coverage
for counseling for smoking and nicotine dependence,
alcohol consumption, healthy diet, and physical activ-
ity among adults.20 Meanwhile, the AMA suggests
incorporating a routine that "requires minimal time,
reinforces the importance of the key health behav-
iors, and refers patients to community resources as
necessary."20 As with clinical counseling, not all com-
munity-based lifestyle interventions have been found
to be effective in the prevention of CHD, but some
interventions show promising results.21 For example, in
a study by Roux and colleagues,22 community-based
interventions to promote physical activity appeared to
substantially reduce incidence of CHD over a lifetime
(140 to 476 cases per 100,000 persons). Comprehen-
sive analysis of the available prevention strategies
might serve as a foundation for improving current and
future prevention efforts in young adults.
Results reported in this study should be interpreted
with the following limitations in mind. First, a misclas-
sification bias is possible in our study. The NHANES
question on family history of heart attack or angina
asks about first-degree relatives younger than 50 years
regardless of sex instead of using 55 years for men and
65 years for women, ages proposed by the NCEP ATP
III. Thus, some participants may be inappropriately
placed in the low-risk rather than in the intermedi-
ate- or high-risk category. Second, the proportion of
participants with CHD or a CHD equivalent may be
underestimated in our study because of lack of data on
peripheral vascular disease, symptomatic carotid artery
disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Our study,
however, focused on young adults for whom the preva-
lence of these conditions is known to be low.23 Finally,
although the collection and examination of laboratory
data were standardized, self-reported data from inter-
views and questionnaires may be subject to misunder-
standing and recall bias.
The findings in this study suggest approximately
two-thirds of all young adults have 1 or more cardio-
vascular risk factors. Among young adults, we found
that the prevalence of high cholesterol levels increased
with the number of CHD risk factors, but the choles-
terol screening rate was less than 50% regardless of
risk status. Our results indicate that improvement of
risk assessment and management for cardiovascular
disease among young adults through evidence-based
clinical and public health interventions is warranted.
To develop and implement these interventions success-
fully, a comprehensive analysis of the currently avail-
able prevention strategies is needed.
