Abstract
Aim: To investigate the impact of statin use on response to fluoroscopy-assisted transforaminal
anterior epidural steroid injection (TAESI).
Methods: Patients undergoing TAESI for low back pain were recruited and stratified according to
statin use. Pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and at 1, 3, and 6 months
after TAESI. Health-related quality-of-life was evaluated using the Short Form 36 (SF-36)
questionnaire 6 months after TAESI.
Results: There were no significant differences in VAS scores after TAESI between statin users
(n ¼ 40) and statin nonusers (n ¼ 253). The SF-36 subgroup: role limitations due to emotional
problems score was significantly lower in statin users than statin nonusers. There were no
significant between-group differences in any other SF-36 parameter.
Conclusion: Statin use had no effect on pain scores after TAESI.

Introduction
Low back painis the leading cause of activity
limitation and work absence throughout
much of the world, and places a large
economic burden on individuals, families,
communities, industry and governments.1
Low back pain is classified as nonspecific
pain without radiculopathy, pain with
radicular symptoms, or secondary pain
with a spinal cause.2 The pathophysiology
of low back pain with radicular symptoms is
complex, and its association with elevated

plasma and local concentrations of inflam-
matory cytokines suggests an inflammatory
component.
Steroid injection therapy has been com-
monly and increasingly used in the treatment
of lumbosacral radiculopathies.3,4 Of the vari-
ous methods of epidural steroid injection
(caudal, interlaminar, or transforaminal injec-
tion5), fluoroscopy-assisted transforaminal
anterior epidural steroid injection (TAESI) is
the preferred technique as it allows direct
guidance into the targeted area and requires a
smaller steroid dose.6,7 The transforaminal
approach targets the ventral lateral epidural
space, which is the primary pathological site.8
Epidural steroid injections are usually supple-
mented with analgesic drugs, due to insuffi-
cient analgesic effects of the steroid itself.
Statins are selective inhibitors of 3-
hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A
(HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. As well
as their broad use as lipid-lowering drugs,
studies have found immunomodulatory and
anti-inflammatory activities for statins, both
in vivo and in vitro, which may be relevant to
their therapeutic effects in neuroinflamma-
tory conditions.9,10­13 Furthermore, statins
have been shown to alleviate neuropathic
pain in a rat model.14 The impact of statin
use on response to epidural steroid injections
remains unknown, however.
The aim of the present study was to test
the hypothesis that statin use results in lower
pain scores (assessed using a visual analogue
scale [VAS]) both before and after TAESI in
patients with low back pain, compared with
those patients not taking statins. The effect
of statin use health-related on quality-of-life
(evaluated with Short Form 36 [SF36]15)
was also assessed.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective, single blind study included
all patients aged !18 years scheduled to
undergo TAESI for low back pain at the
Department of Algology, Adnan Menderes
University, Aydin, Turkey, between April
2012 and December 2013. Indications for
TAESI included radicular pain, lumbar disc
hernia, lumbar canal stenosis or failed back
surgery. Treatment was prescribed by a pain
physician who was blinded to the patient's
statin use (O.N.A.). Exclusion criteria were:
prior TAESI; known allergy to steroids;
indication for surgery; ongoing workers'
compensation claims; unstable opioid use;
psychiatric disorders; drug or alcohol abuse
within the previous 6 months; severe medical
illness that could interfere with the inter-
pretation of study outcomes; myocardial
infarction within the previous 6 months;
pregnancy. Patients were stratified between
two groups: statin users (20 mg atorvastatin
for !3 months) or statin nonusers.
Morphometric and demographic data (age,
sex, weight and height), statin type and
dosage, duration of symptoms, surgical his-
tory and a detailed history of low back pain
were recorded. A detailed pain history was
obtained.
The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Adnan
Menderes University, Aydin, Turkey, and
all patients provided written informed con-
sent prior to enrolment.
TAESI
Before TAESI, all patients provided a VAS
score (0 ¼ no pain, 10 ¼ most severe pain
possible). Vascular access was established
and a 0.9% isotonic sodium chloride drip
was set up. Patients were premedicated with
midazolam 0.02 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 mg/kg,
placed in the prone position on the fluoros-
copy table, and monitored for heart rate,
blood pressure and oxygen saturation. The
skin was cleaned with iodine-based antisep-
tic solution and then covered, in line with the
intstitute's standard sterilization protocol.
All procedures were carried out under local

anaesthesia using C-arm fluoroscopic
guidance.
The TAESI procedure was initiated by
placing the C-arm scope in anteroposterior
position to determine the intervention level.
The scope was then brought into an
$15­20 oblique position to obtain an
image of the intervertebral foramina. The
skin and subcutaneous region was infiltrated
with 1 ml of 1% lidocaine, and a 100 mm
21 G stimulation needle (Stimuplex A 100, B
Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was guided
into the intervertebral foramen. When fron-
tal, anterior and lateral images indicated
that the point of the needle was in the correct
position, 0.5­1 ml of contrast agent was
injected to verify the typical anterior epi-
dural spread. The image was further verified
with anteroposterior and lateral projections.
Subsequently, a mix of 80 mg triamcinolo-
nacetonide (Sinokort A ampoule, 40 mg/ml,
_
I.e.ulagay ilac
¸ sanayi, _
Istanbul) and 3 ml of
0.5% bupivacaine (Bustesin, Vem ilac
¸
sanayi, _
Istanbul) was injected accompanied
by negative aspiration. The total injection
volume was 4 ml if the procedure involved a
single level, or 3 ml/level if more than one
level was involved. The same pain physician,
who was blinded to the patient's statin use
(O.N.A.) performed all the procedures.
After the procedure, all patients were
monitored in the recovery room for 2 h
before returning to the ward. Patients with
no complications were discharged after 6 h
and were followed-up after 2 weeks (routine
postprocedure assessment). Pain scores
(VAS) were assessed 1, 3 and 6 months
after TAESI. Health-related quality-of-life
was evaluated using Short Form 36 (SF-36)
6 months after TAESI.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD.
Between-group comparisons were made
using Student's t-test with Bonferroni's cor-
rection for multiple comparisons. P-values
<0.05 were considered statistically signifi-
cant. Statistical analyses were performed
using JMP Pro version 9.0.00 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
The study evaluated 676 patients for eligi-
bility. Of these, 273 patients were excluded,
403 were enrolled, and 110 were lost to
follow up. The final analysis included 293
patients (131 male/162 female; mean age
58.4 Æ 14.6 years; age range 20­89 years).
Patients were classified as statin users
(n ¼ 40; 19 male/21 female; mean age
63.1 Æ 12.4 years; age range 35­89 years) or
statin nonusers (n ¼ 253; 112 male/141
female; mean age 52.5 Æ 14.2; age range
20­86 years). Demographic and clinical par-
ameters are shown in Table 1. There were no
significant between-group differences in
demographic characteristics except age and
duration of pain. None of the patients
experienced any side-effects of TAESI.
Data regarding VAS and SF-36 scores
are shown in Table 2. There were no signifi-
cant between-group differences in VAS
score. Role limitations due to emotional
problems SF-36 scores were significantly
lower in statin users than statin nonusers
(P < 0.05; Table 2). There were no statistic-
ally significant between-group differences in
any other SF-36 parameter.
Discussion
There was no between-group difference in
pain score after TAESI in the present study.
With the exception of the role limitations
due to emotional problems subcategory,
there were no between-group differences in
health-related quality-of-life.
Low back pain with radicular symptoms is
characterized by a combination of neuro-
pathic and nociceptive mechanisms, and
inflammation with neuronal injury has been
shown to contribute to neuropathic pain.16.17

The main treatment modality for chronic low
back pain with radicular symptoms is epidural
steroid injection.18 Statins have significant
anti-inflammatory effects, and systemic
administration of statins was shown to allevi-
ate mechanical allodynia and thermal hyper-
algesia in neuropathic pain models.9,19

Atorvastatin protects rats from neuropathic
pain inflicted through chronic constriction
injury via inhibition of a nuclear factor kB
and inducible nitric oxide synthase-mediated
injury pathway.20 Few studies have evaluated
the effects of statin use on pain in humans,
although a single case report demonstrated a
significant decrease in stump pain with initi-
ation of statin treatment.21 There was no
between group difference in pain scores after
TAESI in the present study. This may be due
to the small number of patients in the statin
group or the significant between-group differ-
ence in age.
Long-term statin use is associated with
peripheral neuropathy and myotoxicity.22,23
Muscle symptoms are a principal reason for
nonadherence and/or discontinuation, con-
tributing to adverse cardiovascular out-
comes.24 These side-effects can also result
in pain, and may be a possible explanation
of the lower then expected pain relief effect
seen in statin users in the present study.
Statin-associated myopathy with elevated
serum creatinine kinase (CK) is a rare but
serious side-effect, affecting between 0.01
and 0.1% of people taking standard statin
doses.24 Statin-associated muscle symptoms
cover a broader range of clinical presenta-
tions, usually with normal or minimally
elevated CK levels, with a prevalence of
7­29% in registries and observational stu-
dies.24 Preclinical studies indicate that sta-
tins decrease mitochondrial function,
attenuate energy production, and alter
muscle protein degradation, thereby provid-
ing a potential link between statins and
muscle symptoms.24 Controlled mechanistic
and genetic studies are necessary to further
elucidate this effect, although none of the
patients in the present study experienced any
side-effects.
Neuropathic pain adversely affects
health-related quality-of-life, and reduces
physical and emotional function. The lack
of a between group difference in health-
related quality-of-life in our study may be
related to the absence of long-term decreases
in pain score. Alternatively, there may be
unresolved secondary gains or other
unknown factors.
Our study has several limitations. The
sample size was small and patients were not
randomized. Larger, randomized studies are
therefore required to confirm our findings.
In addition, the duration of statin use may
affect the outcome, but this parameter was
not included in our study design.
Furthermore, chronic pain has variable
emotional and affective consequences that
should be addressed. Including SF-36
assessment at the beginning of the study
period as well as 6 months after TAESI
would have provided valuable additional
information regarding the effect of the pro-
cedure on health-related quality-of-life.
In conclusion, we found no significant
effect of statin use on the efficacy of TAESI
for chronic low back pain. Randomized,
double-blind, longitudinal studies with
larger sample sizes are required to confirm
this finding.
