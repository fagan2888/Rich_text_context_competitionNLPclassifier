Introduction
As one of the best exemplars of a student-centered learning
environment, problem-based learning (PBL) was developed
in medical education in the early 1970s and has expanded
into a variety of disciplines (Savery, 2006) at a variety of
education levels (Torp & Sage, 2002). PBL is ideally suited
for student-centered learning and offers the most advantage
in a student-centered classroom (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980;
Driessen & Van Der Vleuten, 2000). This article explores the
prospects and possibilities of incorporating PBL into crimi-
nology and criminal justice education as a way to promote
students' higher order thinking and problem-solving skills.
First, this article discusses a variety of learning theories and
many corresponding instructional models. Second, this arti-
cle provides an overview of PBL and the empirical evidence
for the effectiveness of problem-based instruction. Third,
this article offers theoretical foundations for adopting PBL in
the study of crime and criminal justice. Finally, for scaffold-
ing instructors striving to implement PBL, this article
describes possible formats of implementation, as well as
identifies the challenges new PBL instructors may face dur-
ing application and provides specific suggestions.
Theories of Learning
There have been many scholarly efforts to develop effective
teaching and learning environments in many disciplines.
There are two main underlying traditional learning theories:
the behavioral and cognitive models. The behavioral models
of learning have their origins in the research and theories of
Pavlov (1927), Thorndike (1898, 1913), and Skinner (1953)
on conditioning. Learning is the acquisition of new behavior
through a rewarding or reinforcing stimulus. Behavioral psy-
chologists focus on stimuli in the external environment and
their impact on changes in human behavior (Driscoll, 2005).
The educator's role is to arrange the environment, so that it
produces behavioral changes in the desired direction.
Behavioral instruction is appropriate for skill development
and training. However, the behavioral models of learning
view a learner as a passive recipient of knowledge and over-
look the individual's mental processes (Jonassen & Land,
2000).
However, drawing on the research and theories of Bruner
(1960), Ausubel (1968), Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968), and
other cognitive psychologists, the cognitive models of learn-
ing view a learner as an information processor and focus on
the internal mental processes of learning. The learner will
attend and respond selectively to external stimuli based on
his or her prior knowledge and background. The role of the
instructor is to organize the content for the students so that it
will be easier for them to learn and to build instruction that
enhances their cognitive capacity (Driscoll, 2005). Although

Adopting Problem-Based Learning
in Criminology and Criminal Justice
Education: Challenge and Response
Dae-Young Kim1
Abstract
While problem-based learning (PBL) has been successfully used in many disciplines for over 30 years, it has not yet been widely
adopted by criminal justice instructors. It is a student-centered curriculum that empowers undergraduate students to decide
what they learn and to apply their knowledge and skills while solving real-world problems in relevant and authentic contexts.
The present study provides an overview of PBL and empirical evidence for the effectiveness of problem-based instruction
in many disciplines. This article offers theoretical foundations for adopting PBL in the study of crime and criminal justice.
Finally, for scaffolding instructors striving to implement PBL, this article describes possible formats of implementation and
also identifies the challenges new PBL instructors may encounter during application and provides specific recommendations.

cognitive theories provide detailed descriptions of the cogni-
tive processes for learning, they have had little impact on the
practice of education (Jonassen & Land, 2000). Cognitive
psychologists relied more on knowledge transmission and
reception for cognitive development through lecturing.
Rooted in behavioral and cognitive models, traditional
instruction poses several problems for effective teaching and
learning (Jonassen & Land, 2000). First, traditional instruc-
tion is based on a communication model of instruction (sub-
mission/transmission). The assumption is that knowledge is
transmitted from instructors to students. What has been over-
looked in this model is the importance of active learning on
the part of the student. Second, traditional instruction focuses
on the individual as the medium of learning and overlooked
the social nature of the process of making meaning; students
learn through social interaction with other peers and their
environment.
The primary format of teaching under traditional instruc-
tional models is lecture-based, teacher-centered learning
(Birzer, 2004). Instructors decide what information and skills
students should learn and deliver them. It is the most effi-
cient method of dispensing content knowledge, especially
when instructors can organize difficult subjects into easily
understood formats. However, when students are heteroge-
neous in background, knowledge, or experience, a teacher-
centered method may not meet their different educational
interests and career needs (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980).
Students, in this situation, tend to become passive recipients
of information and less responsible for their own learning.
Finally, traditional instruction has been criticized for failing
to promote advanced knowledge acquisition while oversim-
plifying conceptual complexity in many knowledge domains
and focusing on memorizing facts and low-level concepts
(McCaslin & Good, 1992; Spiro, Feltovich, Jacobson, &
Coulson, 1991). These deficiencies in the outcomes of stu-
dent learning result from biases in the underlying assump-
tions upon which traditional instruction is based (Spiro et al.,
1991).
During the 1990s, constructivist learning theories
emerged for new instructional design. There are three fun-
damental shifts in the underlying assumptions about teach-
ing and learning (Jonassen & Land, 2000; Savery & Duffy,
1995). First, learning is a process of making meaning that is
beyond simple knowledge transfer. Students should con-
struct their own knowledge and meaning from their learning
and experiences. Second, making meaning is a product of
social negotiation with other humans, as well as one of
internal negotiation. For example, students should actively
interact with their peers to construct their own knowledge,
and through making sense of those interactions, they can
create or modify their own knowledge. Third, learning takes
place in association with any social artifacts in the world, as
well as other humans. Students should consider the socio-
cultural and sociohistorical settings in which learning
occurs.
There have been many student-centered learning pedago-
gies reflecting constructivist learning assumptions, such as
PBL (Hmelo-Silver, 2004), anchored instruction (Cognition
and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1992), cognitive
apprenticeships (Collins, 2006; Collins, Brown, & Newman,
1989), reciprocal teaching (Palincsar & Brown, 1984), goal-
based scenarios (Schank, 1992), computer-supported collab-
orative learning (Stahl, Koschmann, & Suthers, 2006),
case-based learning (Kolodner, 2006; Kolodner et al., 2003),
project-based learning (Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2006;
Krajcik, Blumenfeld, Marx, & Soloway, 1994), constructiv-
ist learning environments (Jonassen, 1999), games and simu-
lations (Clark, Nelson, Sengupta, & D'Angelo, 2009), and
open learning environments (Hannafin, Land, & Oliver,
1999). As these student-centered learning approaches pro-
vide more flexible alternatives to the design of instruction,
students are able to make their present learning relevant to
their interests and needs and deepen their understanding
(Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980; Hannafin & Land, 1997).
The Literature Review for PBL
PBL refers to a student-centered curriculum that empowers
students to conduct research and requires them to learn
knowledge and skills while solving real work problems in
relevant and authentic contexts (Glasgow, 1997; Savery,
2006). Given that PBL has been used in a variety of forms
across disciplines and educational levels, it is imperative to
identify some of its essential characteristics to reduce possi-
ble misapplications and achieve the anticipated learning out-
comes (Maudsley, 1999). Barrows (2002) described in detail
four key elements of PBL.1 First, ill-structured problems are
presented to students in a way that they produce multiple
potential causes and solutions through free inquiry.According
to Ge and Land (2004), ill-structured problems are defined as
"those that we encounter in everyday life, in which one or
several aspects of the situation is not well specified, the goals
are unclear, and there is insufficient information to solve
them" (p. 5). When a problem is ill-structured, it is difficult
to reach an agreement on what specific solution is appropri-
ate, and thus there is a larger individual variability in prob-
lem solving (Jonassen, 1997). Second, students have
responsibility for their own learning. They decide what to
learn and find appropriate information to solve the problems
from various resources (libraries, online, experts, and text-
books). Third, instructors act as a class facilitator in the
learning process. Instructors assist students in developing
problem-solving skills by showing them how to learn rather
than simply dispensing information. Fourth, authenticity
forms the learning process of PBL. The problem should be
relevant to students' future careers and lives. The skills and
activities required of students in PBL should be those valued
in real world.
Many scholars have argued that PBL is an appealing
instructional strategy that leads to active, self-directed
Kim 3
learning of students and allows students to learn knowledge
while solving problems (Birch, 1986; Bransford, Sherwood,
Hasselbring, Kinzer, &Williams, 1990; Glasgow, 1997;
Hiebert et al., 1996; Norman & Schmidt, 1992; Stepien &
Gallagher, 1993). There have been a large number of prior
studies to examine the effectiveness of PBL. Most studies
have been conducted in medical schools, but relatively little
research has occurred in other disciplines. For example, using
a quasi-experimental research design, Tayyeb (2013) exam-
ined the effectiveness of PBL to improve content knowledge
and critical thinking among medical students. He found that
the PBL curriculum is more effective than the traditional lec-
ture-based curriculum in improving critical thinking and
problem-solving skills among medical students. In general,
empirical findings in prior studies are more favorable to PBL
curriculum over traditional lecture-based curriculum when it
comes to student outcomes such as motivation, interest, stu-
dent satisfaction, clinical performance, deeper understanding,
contextual learning, self-directed learning, and/or self-regu-
lated learning at various disciplines and educational levels
(e.g., Gallagher, Stepien, & Rosenthal, 1992; Kaufman &
Mann, 1996; Klegeris & Hurren, 2011; Loyens, Magda, &
Rikers, 2008; Prosser, 2004; Rideout et al., 2002; Smits et al.,
2003; Spinello & Fischbach, 2004; Sungur & Tekkaya, 2006).
Despite the positive evidence of PBL on student learning
outcomes, there has been no agreement on the effectiveness
of PBL. For example, Sevening and Baron (2002) compared
study outcomes between the PBL and the traditional lecture-
based classes using a quasi-experimental research design.
They found no differences between the two groups in terms
of students' achievement gains and attitudes. In addition,
after reviewing 12 prior studies, Berkson (1993) concluded
that there is no evidence that the PBL curriculum improved
problem solving, knowledge acquisition, motivation, and/or
self-directed learning skills compared with the traditional
lecture-based curriculum.
A number of meta-analyses were conducted to explain
these mixed results and provide a synthesis of the effects of
PBL, especially for medical education (Albanese & Mitchell,
1993; Berkson, 1993; Colliver, 2000; Dochy, Segers, Van
den Bossche, & Gijbels, 2003; Gijbels, Dochy, Van den
Bossche, & Segers, 2005; Kalaian, Mullan, & Kasim, 1999;
Newman, 2003; Vernon & Blake, 1993; see Strobel &
Barneveld, 2009, for a summary of meta-analyses). However,
there were still inconsistent results on the value of the PBL
instruction. For example, Vernon and Blake (1993) demon-
strated "the superiority of the PBL approach over more tradi-
tional methods in several of the outcome domains examined"
(p. 557). In contrast, according to Colliver (2000), there was
"no convincing evidence for the effectiveness of PBL, at
least not the magnitude of effectiveness that would be hoped
for with a major curriculum intervention" (p. 264).
Using a qualitative meta-synthesis of the existing meta-
analyses, Strobel and Barneveld (2009) concluded that "PBL
was superior when it comes to long-term retention, skill
development, and satisfaction of students and teachers, while
traditional approaches were more effective for short-term
retention as measured by standardized board exams" (p. 44).
Although the traditional learning curriculum has an advan-
tage over the PBL curriculum when it comes to short-term
acquisition and retention for the standardized board exams
(multiple-choice and true/false items), knowledge acquisi-
tion through the traditional methods is not transferred into
long-term memory and lasts for a very limited amount of
time. Most importantly, as PBL was designed to promote stu-
dents' application of knowledge within an authentic context,
change their attitudes toward active learning, and promote
their positive social interaction skills, the focus on short-term
knowledge gain as the learning outcome of PBL is inappro-
priate (Barrows, 2002). Finally, by conducting a meta-
analysis, Walker and Leary (2009) examined differences in
PBL outcomes across disciplines such as allied health, busi-
ness, engineering, medical education, science, social sci-
ence, teacher education, and others (aviation, kinesiology,
and textiles). Overall, PBL was found to be a more effective
instructional method in the last three disciplines than tradi-
tional lecture-based learning.
PBL has been used in criminal justice practice and educa-
tion. For example, as part of efforts to support problem-ori-
ented policing (POP),2 many law enforcement agencies have
adopted PBL at their police training academies. Although
anecdotal evidence of the effectiveness of PBL in police
training exists, there was no empirical evidence. Werth
(2009) examined learners' perceptions of their PBL experi-
ences at the Idaho Peace Officer Standards and Training
(POST) Academy. PBL was effective in the development of
decision-making, problem-solving, and collaboration skills
as well as providing subject-matter knowledge.
Although there have been scholarly efforts to incorporate
active learning techniques into criminal justice courses so as
to promote higher order thinking and relevant knowledge
(Birzer, 2004; Payne, Sumter, & Sun, 2003; Rockell, 2009;
Sims, 2006; Smith, Meade, & Koons-Witt, 2009), PBL is a
relatively new learning pedagogy. Within my knowledge,
there are only a few articles that introduce PBL in the crimi-
nal justice courses. For example, as one of the four active
learning pedagogies such as collaborative learning, PBL,
service learning, and engaging undergraduate students in
research, Sims (2006) provided an overview of PBL (i.e., ori-
gins, activities, advantages, and disadvantages) for the use of
PBL in criminal justice courses. Burke and Owen (2011)
briefly discussed four PBL activities that can be incorporated
into criminal justice courses such as discussion scenarios,
tabletop simulations, role-playing activities, and case
method. Finally, this article will expand existing literature by
providing theoretical frameworks to incorporate PBL into
criminology and criminal justice education. Also, this article
identifies several challenges and proposes recommendations
for successful implementation of PBL in criminology and
criminal justice classrooms.
4 SAGE Open
Theoretical Framework for
Incorporating PBL Into Criminology
and Criminal Justice
Cognitive Flexibility Theory
Cognitive flexibility theory provides a conceptual model for
designing learning environments in which students can
develop their cognitive flexibility; that is, the ability to
assemble and use diverse knowledge sources to promote
their understanding and decision-making in a given situation
(Spiro, Coulson, Feltovich, & Anderson, 1988). Cognitive
flexibility is very important for advanced knowledge acqui-
sition in ill-structured disciplines. There are seven theoretical
rationales: (a) avoidance of oversimplification and overregu-
larization of knowledge, (b) the use of multiple mental and
pedagogical representations of knowledge, (c) the centrality
of case application, (d) conceptual knowledge as knowledge-
in-use, (e) schema assembly from rigidity to flexibility, (f)
non-compartmentalization of concepts and cases, and (g)
active participation, tutorial guidance, and adjunct support
for the management of complexity.
In a nutshell, in ill-structured disciplines such as history,
medicine, law, and literary interpretation, many concepts
from various disciplines are pertinent and interact contextu-
ally in the typical case of knowledge application. Instructors
should demonstrate the complexities and irregularities of
advanced knowledge acquisition, while emphasizing the
interactions among diverse sources of knowledge (Spiro et
al., 1988). It is difficult to count on general principles to aid
an understanding of the dynamics of particular cases because
there is great deal of variability across cases regarding which
concepts are relevant, and what patterns and combinations of
knowledge are necessary to understand a case. Thus, stu-
dents should be able to use various aspects of cross-disciplin-
ary knowledge and apply them flexibly in diverse contexts.
In this regard, knowledge acquisition in ill-structured disci-
plines cannot be achieved simply by listening to instructors'
lectures and/or reading textbooks (Land, Hannafin, & Oliver,
2012). Instead, it requires active participation from students,
and instructors must provide adequate guidance and support
to promote students' active learning.
Cognitive flexibility is the foundation of PBL. The PBL
curriculum allows learners to focus on a problem and encour-
ages them to take multidisciplinary and integrated perspec-
tives to understand all factors involved in finding causes and
solutions. It also produces more active student participation,
interaction, and collaboration in classrooms by involving the
students in the solving of problems. Through PBL, students
develop cognitive flexibility by learning how to use various
knowledge sources for problem solving in new contexts.
Problem-solving skills are very important for human exis-
tence, especially in a constantly changing social environment
that requires people to continually engage in social
problems. Traditionally, literacy refers to the ability to read
and write, but in contemporary society literacy refers more to
the functional ability to solve problems in cooperation with
colleagues (Glasgow, 1997). According to Postman and
Weingartner (1969), a new education should set out to culti-
vate experts in "crap detecting," rather than promoting duti-
ful citizens who simply follow conventional assumptions,
standard practices, and cultural uniformity (p. 3). PBL is an
important pedagogical tool helping students develop their
problem-solving abilities and educate them to become indi-
viduals who can creatively respond to challenges within their
profession. Most importantly, PBL is made congruent with
the natural learning processes of humans and the progressive
mechanism of our civilizations through challenge and
response.3
Criminology and Criminal Justice: Interdisciplinary
Studies
According to recent Gallup Polls, crime and the fear of crime
rank as the most important issues in the United States (Jones,
2010; Saad, 2000). Concern over crime has been prevalent
and is an important issue in determining public policy.
American society has higher crime rates than other industri-
alized countries, especially in terms of violent crimes. The
disparity is greatest for homicide. In 2008, the homicide rate
in American society was 5.2 per 100,000; however, it was
much lower in western European nations, such as Italy (1.2),
France (1.4), Germany (0.8), and England and Wales (1.2;
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2008). Despite
recent declines, Americans are still sensing an increase in
crime rates in their communities as well as in the whole
nation (Jones, 2010).
In response to high violent crime rates and the growing
fear of crime, American society has responded punitively by
relying on the use of incarceration. In 2007, there were nearly
2.3 million inmates incarcerated in jails and prisons. The
incarceration rate was 756 per 100,000 U.S. residents (West
& Sabol, 2008). This rate is significantly higher than that of
countries such as Canada (116), England and Wales (153),
Germany (89), and Italy (92; Walmsley, 2008). High incar-
ceration rates become one of the most serious criminal jus-
tice problems in the United States because there are many
collateral consequences of the prison boom, such as over-
crowding, the disproportionate presence of racial minorities,
disruption of family structure and relations, inequality, and
lost social opportunity costs for other social services (e.g.,
education, medical services, and other social welfare pro-
grams; Austin & Irwin, 2001; Merlo, 2006). In addition,
there are numerous other crime and justice problems in the
United States including gangs, drugs/alcohol abuse, guns,
high recidivism rates, racial disparities in crime and punish-
ment, the war on drugs, racial profiling, and mental ill
offenders.
Kim 5
According to Rusche and Kirchheimer (1939/2003),
crime and punishment are causally independent of one
another and more likely to be determined by the same kinds
of socioeconomic factors. The sources of crime and punish-
ment are mostly invisible, and politicians and the public are
not easily able to discern them. It is thus important to exam-
ine the socioeconomic factors associated with crime and
criminal justice problems.
In consequence, criminology and criminal justice are an
archetype of an advanced knowledge acquisition setting.
Various disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, biology,
history, and law, serve as a foundation for the crime and
criminal justice studies. In ill-structured criminology and
criminal justice disciplines, instructors should emphasize the
complexities and irregularities of crime and justice problems
because the knowledge from such diverse fields is pertinent
and interacts contextually in typical cases of problem solv-
ing. For example, there is a significant variation in crime
rates over time across states or local communities in the
United States. It is difficult to count on general principles to
aid an understanding of the dynamics of crimes in each state
or local community. This is because there is a great deal of
variation across cities and states regarding which causes are
relevant and what combinations of knowledge are necessary
to solve crimes. Crimes should be understood in the context
of each unique application. It is, therefore, imperative to cre-
ate a new instructional model and a corresponding learning
environment, so that students learn to integrate various bod-
ies of knowledge from a range of disciplines and apply them
with flexibility in new contexts.
Spiro's cognitive flexibility theories provide a theoretical
background that supports the use of PBL in criminology and
criminal justice education. In the United States, there are
many crime and criminal justice problems to which public
policymakers, criminal justice (CJ) professionals, and the
public need to respond. Through PBL, students learn to iden-
tify the most important problems within the field, think of
ways to practically approach them, and propose realistic
solutions to address the problems. Students should integrate
knowledge from a range of disciplines toward finding solu-
tions because the causes of crime, and hence criminal justice
problems, originate within a range of other socioeconomic
factors. Due to the nature of ill-structured crime and criminal
justice problems, finally, students are required to develop
cognitive flexibility for problem solving.
Interdisciplinary Integration Through PBL
In Interdisciplinary Integration: Building Criminology by
Stealing From Our Friends, Osgood (1998) emphasized the
importance of interdisciplinary approach to the study of
crime and justice as follows:
For every type of variable considered a potential source of
crime--whether it be family, community, brain chemistry,
organizational structure, or labor market--there is some other
group of scholars who take that topic as their primary focus. For
every aspect of the criminal justice system that we find of
interest, there are scholars who study comparable problems in
other settings. I believe that one of the best ways to find new
insights that will help build our field is for criminologists to steal
ideas from these fields and bring them back to the rest of us.
He provides several suggestions to introduce knowledge
from other disciplines to criminology: collaborating with
scholars in other disciplines, keeping track of journals in
other disciplines, attending conferences in other disciplines,
recruiting graduate students from other disciplines, publish-
ing papers in other disciplinary journals, and using textbooks
from other disciplines relevant to crime and criminal justice.
In addition to his suggestions, incorporating the PBL cur-
riculum into crime and justice studies is another way to cross
boundaries and build bridges between criminology and crim-
inal justice and other disciplines. According to Barrows and
Tamblyn (1980), PBL fits exceptionally well in interdisci-
plinary disciplines. In PBL, students focus on a problem and
take multidisciplinary and integrated perspectives to under-
stand all factors involved in finding causes and solutions. A
worksheet for group projects is included in the appendix. To
meet this interdisciplinary goal, group projects can be used
as the stimulus for discussion and collaboration among stu-
dents who have different majors. While working as a group,
students can use experience and knowledge from their own
discipline to enhance their understanding of the problem and
contribute to the development of solutions. Through PBL,
students can also develop cognitive flexibility by learning
how to use various knowledge sources for problem solving
in new contexts. In this regard, PBL is ideally suited for
crime and justice issues that need to be approached from an
interdisciplinary perspective.
Challenge and Response in Adopting
PBL in Criminology and Criminal
Justice Classroom
To reiterate, PBL instructors should adopt the four key ele-
ments of PBL in their course curriculums such as presenting
ill-structured crime and criminal justice problems, promot-
ing student responsibility for learning, acting as a class
facilitator in the learning process, and encouraging students
to use real and authentic problems that are relevant to their
careers and lives. Given that PBL is an open-ended, ill-
structured teaching strategy, instructors are likely to experi-
ence difficulties in all aspects of PBL instruction: planning,
implementing, and assessing (Ertmer & Simons, 2006, n.d.).
For scaffolding criminal justice instructors' effort to adopt
PBL, this article identifies several challenges instructors
may face when implementing PBL and provides specific
suggestions. To clarify our recommendations, this article
incorporates evidence and anecdotes not only from the
6 SAGE Open
literature but also from the author's experiences over the
past many years in implementing PBL classes (i.e.,
Introduction to Criminal Justice, Corrections, Criminology,
Drugs and Crime, and Research Methods).
Challenge 1: Creating a Collaborative Classroom
Culture of PBL
Collaboration is essential in PBL curriculums. According to
Vygotsky (1978), students learn best when they interact with
their peers rather than when they work alone. To promote a
cooperative classroom culture, various forms of peer learn-
ing were included in my classes: group projects, mini-PBL
units, and writing assignments/discussions. First, group proj-
ects are utilized as the stimulus for collaboration among stu-
dents. Students participate in a group that will be responsible
for a group essay and presentation. Students work together to
identify problems at the local, state, and national levels and
to develop relevant solutions. Through the processes of set-
ting a mutual goal and dividing roles and work, students rec-
ognize that their grade is dependent on the performance of
others in the group, feel a responsibility to help others learn,
and finally, build interdependence among them (Ertmer &
Simons, n.d.; Kolodner et al., 2003).
The second strategy is to use mini-PBL units. According
to Stepien and Gallagher (1993), the use of "posthole" units
is important in creating a cooperative environment for dis-
cussion. The term "postholes" refers to small problems that
can be used as practice for mini-PBLunits (Ertmer & Simons,
2006). Prior to working on a semester-long PBL project, stu-
dents have opportunities to work on 1- to 3-day class projects
regarding controversial topics such as mentally ill prisoners,
police corruption, racial profiling, the death penalty, and
overcrowding. While experiencing these mini-PBL units,
students have the opportunity to practice the collaborative
skills that are needed for the semester group project. In addi-
tion, students draw on each other's perspectives and skills
and take interdisciplinary approaches to understand all fac-
tors involved in finding causes and solutions. For example,
being a psychology minor, one student involved in the group
who is interested in the treatment of mentally ill prisoners
introduced the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental
Disorders to the group and brought helpful insight on how to
diagnose individuals with mental disorders.
Classroom debates are also good strategies to help stu-
dents learn to work cooperatively (e.g., brainstorming ideas
or conducting research to support an opinion). For example,
there are often controversies among students in the determi-
nation of group project topics. Through the class debates,
students reach agreement on what are important topics that
are worthy of attention for their projects, determine what
they believe are the main causes for the problems, and finally
decide on feasible solutions.
Third, for individual PBL writing assignments, students
are required to identify a crime or criminal justice problem
they think is worthy of discussion from their readings and
develop solutions that address the problem. In addition, they
present their assignments in class and lead a class discussion.
PBL writing and discussions are driven by free inquiry with
an instructor's guidance and assist students in developing
their problem-solving skills. While sharing their views and
discussing them with their peers, students also get the oppor-
tunity to find others who have similar interests and recruit
their partners for the group project. Most importantly, stu-
dents become familiar with the cooperative environment and
develop collaborative skills.
At the beginning of a semester, informal group meetings
with students are helpful in promoting collaborative learn-
ing. These meetings allow an instructor to learn students'
career interests and expectations for the course. Students also
learn not only the instructor's expectations but other stu-
dents' backgrounds and interests. It is also useful to have
meetings with students in the middle of the semester to deter-
mine how much progress they are making toward their group
projects. Instructors can assess student perceptions and
acceptance toward PBL implementation and if necessary
modify curriculums reflecting their current needs and capac-
ities. Finally, these informal meetings promote positive
social interaction among students and contribute to the cre-
ation of a collaborative learning environment in which stu-
dents share their experiences and skills.
Challenge 2: Adjusting to Changing Roles
In a collaborative culture, instructors should change both
how and what they teach (Grant & Hill, 2006). Successful
PBL implementation depends on the capacity of instructors
to change the way they teach students and manage the class
(Krajcik et al., 1994). In PBL curricula, instructors play the
role of a class facilitator rather than assuming the role of a
director (Savery & Duffy, 1995). By developing authentic
group projects, PBL instructors create students' motivation
for learning and engage them actively in class. Instructors
teach students how to learn and how to solve problems,
rather than simply conveying the information and requiring
them to memorize it.
There are several strategies to help instructors adjust to
their changing roles as class facilitators. First, the use of ritu-
als (classroom scripts for specific activities) helps instructors
make the transition to becoming effective class facilitators
(Kolodner et al., 2003). Rituals make instructors feel more
comfortable in their roles as facilitators by keeping them
apprised of what practices are scheduled and what project
outcomes are expected at different times in PBL processes
(e.g., brainstorming ideas, designing research, defining a
problem, locating information, identifying causes, develop-
ing solutions, and preparing a presentation). Second, running
mini-PBL units provides instructors with opportunities to
practice facilitating roles and skills (Ertmer & Simons,
2006). While experiencing these mini-PBL units, instructors
Kim 7
become more comfortable in their facilitating roles in the
PBL process. Students also can adjust to the PBL approach
and adopt their new roles as an active learner (Stepien &
Gallagher, 1993). Third, instructors increase the understand-
ing of their facilitative roles in PBL classrooms by observing
how experienced PBL instructors manage their classes
(Ertmer & Simons, 2006). It is important to develop social
networks with other PBL-using instructors who can support
one another in their efforts toward successfully implement-
ing PBL classes (Ertmer, 2005).
In PBL curriculums, however, students also need to adopt
new roles as active learners. Students are not just passive
recipients of knowledge from instructors. As active learners,
they instead must learn to decide what they learn, which
resources they use, and how they communicate their solu-
tions. To promote students'active learning, it is imperative to
acknowledge their interests and skills and to reflect them in
class development (e.g., developing rubrics, inviting guest
lecturers, having peer evaluations, and so on; Glasgow,
1997). Students become more responsible for their own
learning by becoming involved in planning, implementing,
and evaluating the class curriculum (Land et al., 2012).
Shifting learning responsibility to the students can pro-
duce positive learning outcomes. First, students become
more motivated to learn on their own. For example, they can
relate their learning to their career goals and personal experi-
ences. Students are willing to share their personal experi-
ences involving crime and criminal justice systems as CJ
practitioners and ex-offenders in classrooms. In addition,
many students in prior classes volunteered to invite guest
lecturers (e.g., judges, probation officers, drug counselors,
domestic violence case managers, inmates, and the like) to
incorporate real-world problems into classroom discussions.
For example, one student involved in the group project
(Drugs and Crime) helped other students understand the
problem of drug abuse and the recovery process based on his
or her firsthand experiences as a drug abuse counselor and
ex-drug addict.
Second, by assuming active roles in learning, students
enhance their skills for self-directed and self-regulated learn-
ing (Brush & Saye, 2001; Grant & Hill, 2006; Sungur &
Tekkaya, 2006). By having choices for exploration, students
are motivated to initiate research projects, set goals, and
develop planning guidelines to achieve their goals. By ana-
lytically reflecting their needs for learning and learning how
to meet those needs, students develop the capacity to manage
resources, evaluate their progress, and adjust their goals.
Finally, these self-directed or self-regulated students are
more likely to develop critical thinking and problem-solving
abilities by constantly engaging themselves in CJ problems,
thinking of ways to practically approach them, and propos-
ing realistic solutions (Brush & Saye, 2001).
Due to their shifting learning responsibilities, however,
students easily become frustrated or disoriented (Ertmer &
Simons, 2006). For example, when students identify topics
for their PBL projects and assignments, they often encounter
difficulties in deciding what is important, interesting, and
relevant and in locating resources for learning. Those con-
fusing frustrations are very intensive to students who are not
motivated for learning and who are accustomed to a more
structured classroom environment where the instructor
assigns topics for them to explore.
According to Glasgow (1997), frustration is part of prob-
lem solving, and solutions rarely come without frustration.
He calls this process creative confusion. In PBL curricu-
lums, the process of dealing with frustrations and difficul-
ties toward completing a group project is as important as the
actual outcome. The important thing is learning how to deal
with frustrations. If they successfully handle these frustra-
tion situations, students become more motivated to learn
and also attain desirable outcomes for group projects.
Instructors should encourage students to research what pre-
vious research has done or engage in brainstorming with
group members. Instructors can also share previous stu-
dents' projects to help students understand how to formulate
a problem and how possible topics can be transformed into
strong projects.
In addition, many students in prior classes attempted to
find solutions by visiting the CJ field and interviewing prac-
titioners for their group projects and assignments. For the
group project in the institutional corrections course, for
example, one group (Women and Drug) was interested in
crime and women's issues in the initial stage but had diffi-
culty narrowing down the research topic and making it more
manageable. To overcome this difficulty, the group contacted
many governmental and non-governmental agencies in the
community and asked former instructors. The group
exchanged many emails with them over the semester. Finally,
the members visited the Nebraska Women's Correctional
Center (NWCC) to find out the problems women had inside
the prison. In collaboration with correctional staff, they were
able to identify drug use among female inmates and attempted
treatment in a women's prison in York, Nebraska. Also, they
invited correctional officers and female inmates as guest
speakers to present correctional issues in class
Challenge 3: Identifying the Real-World Problem
PBLclassesrevolvearoundauthenticproblems(Mergendoller
& Thomas, 2005). To successfully implement a PBL class, it
is thus imperative for both students and instructors to iden-
tify good driving questions that are relevant to students'
career interests, allow students to develop their own investi-
gations, and promote students'collaboration toward problem
solving (Lehman, Ertmer, Keck, & Steele, n.d). In addition,
students should be able to learn significant course materials
while working on these problems (Checkley, 1997; Murray
& Savin-Baden, 2000; Stephien, 1997).
There are several good sources that can be used to identify
good driving questions, for example, newspaper mass media,
8 SAGE Open
CJ agencies, ex-offenders and inmates, and field trips. First,
instructors and students should pay close attention to local
crime and justice issues that have appeared in the local news-
paper and/or on television and capitalize on them for PBL
projects and discussion. For example, the author used local
crime problems for a criminology class titled "Why does
Fort Smith in Arkansas have higher violent and property
crime rates than the national average and other cities?"
According to the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) data, in
2009, the violent and property crime rates in Fort Smith were
835 and 5,860 per 100,000 residents. These rates signifi-
cantly exceed the national averages (for violent crime, 429
per 1,000 residents; for property crime, 3,036 per 1,000 resi-
dents). Another question at issue is "Why does Fort Smith
have different historical crime trends compared with U.S.
national crime trends?" Violent and property crime rates in
Fort Smith dramatically increased during the 1990s and
reached the highest peak during the mid-2000s, while
national crime rates substantially decreased and have since
remained fairly stable.
Students were required to discuss as many local socioeco-
nomic factors as possible causes and develop solutions that
originate from the social and economic conditions rather
than simply enacting laws and punishing violators.Therefore,
students investigated various statistical indicators, such as
poverty, inequality, unemployment, immigration, popula-
tion, divorce rates, drug problems, metal health problems,
and CJ policies (incarceration rates), and discussed their pos-
sible effects on changes in crime problems in Fort Smith
using various bodies of knowledge from a range of
disciplines.
Second, to identify crime and justice problems, instruc-
tors and students can observe, interview, and/or correspond
with CJ practitioners and other key informants (e.g., ex-
offenders, drug users, and inmates). For example, the author
contacted the director of the Nebraska Department of
Correctional Services and invited its collaboration for stu-
dents' group projects. The director suggested several topics
for group projects and also provided an initial contact with
whom students could correspond to have questions answered
or to obtain information. CJ practitioners provided informa-
tion and many resources to help students in every aspect of
their group projects. After the semester, the director invited
the instructor and students to a meeting of his agency staff to
discuss students' findings and to listen to recommendations.
During these corporative processes, CJ agencies can gain
new insights and trends in corrections from students'
research.
Finally, field visitations can be incorporated into PBL cur-
riculums. For example, early on in the semester, students
were required to participate in institutional tours. Using criti-
cal and analytical skills, they should observe the correctional
facility and interview inmates and practitioners. To supple-
ment these tours and observations, students are required to
write about the institutional tour through the lens of the PBL
model. According to Rockell (2009), it is important to
reinforce these occasional activities with various individual
and group assignments to enhance criminal justice students'
critical thinking. Through these processes, each student can
identify actual criminal justice problems as a stimulus for his
or her learning experience and link these experiences to
group projects.
Challenge 4: Locating/Collecting Resources
According to Ertmer and Simons (n.d.), research problems
should be feasible and thus must be developed with a consid-
eration of both available resources and students'current abil-
ities. If resources are limited or unavailable, no matter how
authentic and relevant the problem is, students cannot suc-
cessfully complete their projects (Ward & Lee, 2002).
Implementing PBL classes is more successful when there is
a wide range of resources available to students with their
group projects and assignments.
Accordingly, instructors should be able to identify the
basic resources students will need at each stage of the PBL
process, and thus, it is imperative for instructors to take suf-
ficient time and effort for collaboration with external resource
people (e.g., librarians, other faculty, and CJ practitioners).
First, instructors can communicate these needs to their school
media specialist and local librarians, inviting them to their
class as guest speakers. They can provide students with
information on how to search for their projects from various
resources (e.g., Internet, library, journal articles, newspapers,
magazines, etc.). Second, given the interdisciplinary nature
of CJ, it is a good idea for instructors to coordinate with other
faculty, especially in other disciplines. Also, instructors can
provide students with reading materials (journal articles and/
or textbooks) from other disciplines. Finally, it is imperative
that instructors make a range of community resources avail-
able to students for their group projects. With the sponsor-
ship of their professor, students can interact with CJ
practitioners and/or community members for their projects
when they get frustrated trying to identify a problem, locate
resources, or develop solutions.
Challenge 5: Developing Assessment Methods
and Instruments
In PBL learning environments emphasizing the importance
of group work, it is imperative to design appropriate learn-
ing-assessment methods that address both individual and
group accountability (Ertmer & Simons, n.d.). Involving stu-
dents in evaluating their learning is important rather than
merely relying on instructor assessment. It is also valuable to
incorporate critique from criminal justice agencies if group
projects are designed in cooperation with them. Including
various audiences (peer, self, and outsider) can be a strong
motivator for students to set higher personal standards for
their projects and improve their work (Glasgow, 1997).
Through critiques from various audiences, students can
appreciate the diversity of one another's perspectives,
Kim 9
develop communication skills, and build positive social
interactions among themselves.
Students can serve as evaluators in several ways. Students
watch other groups' presentations and evaluate others' per-
formances. There are also confidential peer reviews on the
performance of group members in the students' own group
(including self-evaluation). Each group member evaluates
how well his or her group worked together and whether the
workload was fairly shared. To facilitate these evaluation
processes, it is important to provide a rubric for peer- and/or
self-evaluation. According to Mergendoller and Thomas
(2005), experienced PBL instructors often develop rubrics or
rating scales in collaboration with students, so that students
can promote understanding of their projects and establish
standards for quality outcomes.
In addition to these product assessments, it is important to
establish process assessment in PBL curriculums.According to
Delisle (1997), "Assessment of student performance begins the
first day a PBL problem is introduced and lasts until the final
product is reviewed" (p. 37). Assessment for learning is an
ongoing process and thus needed at all stages of the PBL pro-
cess. An individual portfolio can be used as a process-
assessment method. A portfolio refers to the student's collec-
tion of documents that illustrate his or her works and contribu-
tions over the course of his or her group project (Glasgow,
1997). Individual portfolios serve as a great resource for
instructors when evaluating students'performances and contri-
butions to their group projects during each stage of the PBL
process, which is not always apparent in the final product.
However, individual portfolios also provide students with
opportunities for self-reflection and assessment. Students
reflect on their own experiences and evaluate their own per-
formance and contributions toward the completion of the
group project. In addition, the portfolio plays a role as a self-
built structure of guidelines and methods for getting things
done in an orderly and logical fashion (Glasgow, 1997).
While building their individual portfolios, students remind
themselves of what the next step is and evaluate their prog-
ress toward completing the group project. In PBL curricu-
lums, it is important for students to develop self-directed
learning skills (e.g., set their goals, monitor their progress,
identify resources, and assess their performance; Brush &
Saye, 2001; Grant & Hill, 2006).
Conclusion
This article attempts to introduce PBL methods into crimi-
nology and criminal justice classrooms for more advanced
knowledge acquisition. In introductory classes, the goal is
often more exposure to content and the establishment of a
general knowledge of crime and criminal justice. Students
are exposed to many of the subject areas of criminology and
are expected to memorize and recall the pre-defined content,
but they are not likely to learn critical thinking and applica-
tion skills. In upper-level classes, therefore, the goals and
methods of education must change for more advanced
knowledge acquisition. Students must recognize conceptual
complexity in important aspects of crime and justice prob-
lems and apply the knowledge obtained from introductory
classes to application situations. As reflected in the findings
of prior studies, while teaching through traditional methods
is suited for the acquisition of knowledge in introductory
classes, PBL is an effective instructional method to foster
higher level thinking and problem-solving skills in upper-
level classes.
In criminology and criminal justice education, PBL can
offer many advantages over traditional teaching methods.
First, students take on a research problem as a stimulus for
their learning, identify causes of the problem, and finally
develop solutions. Given multiple sources of problems, stu-
dents consider multiple perspectives and take an interdisci-
plinary approach to the studies of crime and criminal justice.
They can develop their cognitive flexibility to think holisti-
cally to see the relevant factors related to the problem of
interest and discuss meaningful solutions. Through PBL pro-
cesses, students learn to think of how to approach and pro-
pose realistic solutions practically to address crime and
justice problems.
Second, by having choices and options for exploration,
students learn to decide what they study, which resources
they use, and how they communicate their solutions. They
can also make their present learning relevant to future educa-
tional and/or career needs. This self-determination leads stu-
dents to take responsibility for their learning and can develop
the capacity to reflect their needs and learn to meet those
needs. Students become more interested, motivated, and self-
directed to learn and actively engage in class activities and
discussions.
Third, due to the interdisciplinary nature of the subject,
criminal justice studies work better through discussion and
debate while requiring cooperative learning. For example,
problem-based group projects facilitate collaborations and
interactions among students as well as between students and
the instructor. Students learn how to set short- and long-term
goals and to work cooperatively toward addressing the prob-
lem. Through collaboration, they can also build positive
interactions between individuals and develop communica-
tion and interaction skills, which are essential for criminal
justice professionals. According to Dewey (1930), education
in a democratic society should promote criticism, self-
education, and constant growth. PBL helps students build
many democratic characters in them, such as responsibility
for learning, teamwork, communication skills, and respect
for others. Finally, although the theoretical argument for the
adoption of PBL in criminal justice classroom is compelling,
implementing PBL is still challenging for instructors. Future
studies need to explore various possible formats of PBL in
criminology and criminal justice classroom. It is also imper-
ative to empirically examine the effectiveness of PBL in
criminology education.

Notes
1. On the website for the problem-based learning (PBL) Initiative
(http://www.pbli.org/pbl/generic_pbl.htm), Barrows identifies
additional characteristics of PBL and provide in detail expla-
nation for them.
2. Problem-oriented policing (POP) is designed to solve under-
lying problems that give rise to crime while emphasizing the
importance of collaboration with many stakeholders (e.g.,
judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, community members).
POP recommends the use of the Scanning, Analysis, Response
and Assessment(SARA) model as an analytic approach to
problem solving in place of an overreliance on the criminal
law. The SARA model entails four steps: Scanning, Analysis,
Response, and Assessment. Police should proactively scan
their areas of responsibility and identify a crime problem by
drawing on various data sources. Next, they analyze the prob-
lem to determine its scope, nature, and underlying causes.
Following the analysis, the police should develop the most
promising responses that might solve the problem, after con-
sidering a wide range of alternatives. After implementing
these responses, the police should assess them and decide
whether the current policy should be replaced, strengthened,
or improved. For more information, refer to the website for the
Center for Problem-Oriented Policing (http://www.popcenter.
org/).
3. In A Study of History (1946), Toynbee analyzes the geneses,
growths, breakdowns, and disintegrations of every known
human civilization. He explains how civilizations emerged
from primitive societies and why some flourished and still
survive while others failed. Toynbee discovers a recurring
pattern of "Challenge and Response" in the rise and fall of
civilizations, which is a law of history. The rise and fall of civi-
lizations were determined by the responses of human beings
to difficult challenges rather than biological (race) and envi-
ronmental factors (i.e., military attack and natural disasters).
If civilizations responded in a creative manner to challenges,
they rose to power and dominance; if not, their civilizations
broke down and disintegrated. He emphasizes the importance
of creative people who have the abilities to find innovative
solutions to social challenges.
