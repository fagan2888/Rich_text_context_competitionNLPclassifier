Abstract
Objective: To investigate associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
rs2228314 and rs2267443 in the sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 gene (SREBP-2) and
knee osteoarthritis (OA) susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.
Methods: SREBP-2 rs2228314 and rs2267443 polymorphisms were genotyped in patients with
knee OA and age- and sex-matched OA-free controls from a Chinese Han population.
Results: A total of 402 patients with knee OA and 410 controls were enrolled in the study. GC
and CC genotypes of rs2228314, and variant C, were associated with a significantly increased risk
of knee OA. On stratification analysis, the association between the risk of OA and rs2228314 GC
heterozygotes compared with GG homozygotes was stronger in females and those aged
>65 years. In contrast, the GA and AA genotypes of rs2267443 were not significantly associated
with the risk of knee OA, even after further stratification analysis according to age or sex.
Conclusions: SREBP-2 rs2228314 G to C change and variant C genotype may contribute to knee
OA risk in a Chinese Han population.

Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex degenera-
tive joint disease characterized by late-onset
degeneration of the articular cartilage,1
which results in structural and functional
failure of synovial joints;2 in 2008 it was
estimated to affect 27 million people in the
USA.3 Factors including genetic susceptibil-
ity, increased mechanical load, injury,
inflammation of the joint, age and obesity
have been shown to contribute to OA
risk.4­7 Interestingly, there is evidence that
OA is not only a degenerative joint disease,
but is also a metabolic disease associated
with deregulation of genes involved in
lipid metabolism and cholesterol efflux.8
Furthermore, proteomic analysis studies
have revealed that many proteins involved
in lipid metabolism are differentially
expressed in osteoarthritic cartilage com-
pared with normal cartilage.9,10
Sterol regulatory element binding pro-
teins (SREBPs) are transcription factors that
bind to the sterol regulatory element DNA
sequence and regulate lipid metabolism.11
Three isoforms have so far been identified:
SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c and SREBP-2.12­15 It
has been reported that single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes encod-
ing for SREBPs are associated with diseases
related to metabolic syndrome, including
type 2 diabetes,16 hyperlipoproteinaemia17
and hypercholesterolaemia.18 SREBP-2,
encoded by a separate gene on human
chromosome 22, plays a central role in the
maintenance of lipid homeostasis.11 This
protein is found in the membrane of endo-
plasmic reticulum and forms a complex with
SREBP cleavage activating protein
(SCAP).19 When cholesterol is deficient in
cells, SCAP will transport SREBP-2 from
the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi
complex. Here, the proteins are cleaved by
site-1 and site-2 proteases and are maturated
to a soluble transcription factor that stimu-
lates the expression of their target genes.
These genes encode enzymes with important
roles in the synthesis and uptake pathways of
cholesterol and triglyceride.20
The SNP rs2228314 in the SREBP-2 gene
results in substitution of a glycine by an
alanine at amino acid 595 (G595A) of the
SREBP-2 protein; it has been shown to be
associated with intima­media thickness (a
marker of atherosclerosis) and total choles-
terol levels in hypercholesterolaemic
patients, and with elevated plasma lipid
levels.21,22 A study in Greek patients
reported a significant association between
the SNP rs2228314 in SREBP-2 and the
development of OA.23 In addition, the GA
genotype of the SNP rs2267443 in SREBP-2
has been shown to be significantly associated
with the risk of avascular necrosis of the
femoral head in Chinese Han24 and Korean
populations.25 On the basis of these studies,
possible correlations between the SNPs
rs2228314 (position 42276742) and
rs2267443 (position 42287454) in SREBP-2
and susceptibility to knee OA were investi-
gated in a Chinese Han population. As the
distance between these two SNPs is 10 713
nucleotides, it was not necessary to perform
haplotype analysis.
Patients and methods
Patients
In this hospital-based case­control study,
consecutive Han Chinese patients diagnosed
with knee arthritis between March 2007 and
May 2012 at the Department of
Orthopaedics, Sir Run Run Shaw
Hospital, Zhejiang University School of
Medicine, Hangzhou, China, were evaluated
for inclusion. Anteroposterior extended-
view weightbearing radiographs of the
affected knees were obtained. Radiographic
features were assessed by two examiners
blinded to the clinical information to give a
global Kellgren­Lawrence (KL) score ran-
ging between 0 and 4, as previously
described.26 Only patients with radiographic
Qiu et al. 321
OA, defined as a KL score of !2, were
included in the study. Other aetiologies of
knee joint disease such as inflammatory
arthritis (rheumatoid, polyarthritic
or autoimmune disease), post-traumatic or
postseptic arthritis, skeletal dysplasia or
developmental dysplasia were excluded.
Age- (Æ5 years) and sex-matched healthy
volunteers were recruited from the same
hospital during the same period. Selection
criteria for the controls included no history
of OA and a KL score <2 on radiographic
examination. Age, sex, weight, height and
body mass index (BMI) were recorded for all
study participants.
Written informed consent was provided
by all participants and the study protocol
was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang
University School of Medicine, Hangzhou,
China.
Genotyping
Venous blood samples were obtained from
all study participants using ethylenediamine
tetra-acetic acid anticoagulant (20 g/l).
Genomic DNA was extracted immediately
from 200 ml of venous blood using a
QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions and stored at À80C
until analysis. The SNPs rs2228314 and
rs2267443 in SREBP-2 were genotyped
using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). The polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed using 100 ng of gen-
omic DNA, 0.2 mM of each primer, 0.1 mM
of each probe, 200 mM of each deoxyribo-
nucleotide, 3 mM MgCl2
and 1 U Platinum
Taq DNA polymerase. PCR amplification
was carried out using the 7900HT Fast Real-
Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions, with an initial denaturation at 95C
for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95C for 15 s and annealing
at 65C for 30 s. Data analyses were per-
formed using ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence
Detection System software version 2.3
(Applied Biosystems). Approximately 5%
of the samples were randomly selected for
repeated genotyping, for confirmation.
Statistical analyses
The Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium was
tested using a goodness-of-fit 2-test to
compare observed and expected genotype
frequencies in controls. Differences in the
distributions of demographic characteristics
and rs2228314 and rs2267443 genotypes
between patients with OA and controls
were evaluated using the Wilcoxon's test
for analysis of age and the 2-test for all
other variances. Associations between the
SREBP-2 variants and OA risk were esti-
mated by calculating the odds ratios (ORs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using
both univariate and multivariate logistic
regression analysis with adjustments for
age, sex and BMI. Two-sided tests were
used for statistical analyses and a
P-value < 0.05 was considered to be statis-
tically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSSÕ version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The statis-
tical power of the study as calculated using
Power and Sample Size Calculation soft-
ware version 3.0 (Department of
Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, TN, USA) was 0.56.
Results
A total of 802 Chinese Han patients with
knee arthritis were evaluated. Of these, 402
had radiographic knee OA and were
included in the study. In addition, 410 age-
and sex-matched healthy controls were
recruited. There were no significant differ-
ences in demographic characteristics
between the two groups (Table 1).
322 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
The observed genotype frequencies for
the rs2228314 and rs2267443 polymorph-
isms in the controls agreed with that
expected according to the Hardy­Weinberg
principle (data not shown). The results of
repeat genotyping of randomly selected
samples were 100% concordant.
The genotype and allele distributions of
the rs2228314 and rs2267443 polymorph-
isms in patients with knee OA and healthy
controls are shown in Table 2. The genotype
distribution for rs2228314 was significantly
different between the two groups
(P < 0.001). After adjustment for age, sex
and BMI, a significantly increased risk of
knee OA was associated with the genotype
GC of rs2228314 compared with the GG
genotype. In addition, those bearing at least
one C allele (GC þ CC) had a significantly
increased risk of knee OA compared with
those without the C allele (GG). However,
the GA and AA genotypes of rs2267443
were not significantly associated with the
risk of knee OA.
Stratification analysis was performed to
evaluate the potential association of genetic
variants of SREBP-2 rs2228314 with knee
OA risk in subgroups based on demographic
characteristics. When stratified by age, both
young ( 65 years) and old (>65 years)
patients showed significant differences in
genotype frequencies compared with con-
trols (P < 0.001) (Table 3). When the asso-
ciation between C allele carriers and the risk
of OA was evaluated using logistic regres-
sion analysis, GC heterozygotes carried a
1.82-fold increased risk of OA compared
with GG homozygotes in the young patients
group (Table 3). Similarly, in the old
patients group, GC heterozygotes carried a
2.49-fold increased risk of OA compared
with GG homozygotes (Table 3). When
stratified by sex, both male and female
patients showed significant differences in
genotype frequencies between patients with
OA and controls (P < 0.01) (Table 3). In
addition, GC heterozygotes carried a 1.55-
and 2.46-fold increased risk of knee OA in
males and females, respectively, compared
with GG homozygotes (Table 3).
In contrast, logistic regression analysis of
SREBP-2 rs2267443 genetic variants
showed that the GA and AA genotypes
were not significantly associated with knee
OA susceptibility when stratified by age or
sex (Table 4).
Discussion
In the present hospital-based case­control
study, associations between the potentially
functional SNPs rs2228314 and rs2267443 in
SREBP-2 and the risk of knee OA were
investigated in a Chinese Han population.
The results showed that the SNP rs2228314
polymorphic GC genotype of SREBP-2 and
variant C may contribute to the risk of knee
OA, and that this risk was increased in older

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report linking SREBP-2 SNP rs2228314
with knee OA in a Chinese Han population.
There has been much evidence linking
OA pathogenesis and lipid metabolism,
prompting many scientists to characterize
OA as a metabolic disease.10,27­29 SREBPs
are transcription factors regulating genes
involved in lipid metabolism. The SREBP-2
rs2228314 SNP causes an amino acid change
from glycine to alanine (G595A). Muller
and Miserez18 reported that a G595A sub-
stitution located in the COOH-terminal
regulating region could affect the formation
and stability of the SREBP-2/SCAP com-
plex. The 595 A isoform has been shown to
decrease the stability of the complex com-
pared with the 595 G isoform, thus affecting
the role of SCAP as a sensor of sterol
depletion or excess.18 In addition, SREBP-
2 has been shown to be upregulated in
osteoarthritic chondrocytes.23
The SNP rs2228314 of SREBP-2 was first
identified as a risk factor for OA in a cohort
study in a Greek population.23 However,
there have been no previous studies of the
association between the SREBP-2
rs2228314 SNP and the risk of OA in a
Chinese Han population. Combined with
the results of previous studies, the present
study supports the suggestion that the SNP
rs2228314 of SREBP-2 gene might be a risk
factor for OA. In the present study, individ-
uals carrying SREBP-2 rs2228314 GC þ CC
or GC genotypes had a higher risk of knee
OA than those carrying the GG genotype,
suggesting that the rs2228314 C allele might
be associated with the development of knee
OA.
According to the stratification analysis
undertaken in the present study, the associ-
ation between the risk of knee OA and
rs2228314 GC heterozygotes compared with
GG homozygotes was stronger in female
patients and those >65 years old. This is

consistent with the increased incidence of
knee OA reported in those >50 years of age
and in females.30 As OA is a complex and
multifactorial disease, both gene­gene and
gene­environment interactions may occur
and a single genetic variant is unlikely to be
sufficient to predict overall risk. Further
research is therefore needed to elucidate the
role of other functional SNPs of SREBP-2
and other related genes involved in similar
biological pathways that may be involved in
the aetiology of OA.
Studies have shown a significant associ-
ation between the GA genotype of the
rs2267443 SNP of SREBP-2 and the risk
of avascular necrosis of the femoral head in
a Chinese Han24 and Korean populations.25
However, in the present study, the GA and
AA genotypes of rs2267443 were not signifi-
cantly associated with the risk of knee OA.
In addition, further stratification analysis
according to age or sex did not reveal any
significant associations between knee OA
susceptibility and rs2267443 genotypes.
The present study had a number of
limitations. First, as a hospital-based
study, it may be subject to inherent biases;
however, the C allele frequency in the con-
trol subjects was similar to that in the
haplotype map database, and the genotype
distributions of the rs2228314 and
rs2267443 polymorphisms in the controls
conformed to the Hardy­Weinberg equilib-
rium, suggesting that the results did not
suffer from selection bias. Secondly, the
sample size was relatively modest, therefore
the results should be confirmed in larger
scale studies. Thirdly, only two SREBP-2
SNPs were investigated; SNPs at other loci
may also be associated with susceptibility
to OA.
In conclusion, the present study was the
first to show that the genotype distribution
of the SREBP-2 rs2228314 polymorphism
was significantly different between
patients with knee OA and healthy controls
in a Chinese Han population. Larger
population-based and in-depth molecular
studies are required, to validate these cur-
rent findings and to elucidate the functional
roles of the rs2228314 polymorphism in the
aetiology of OA.
