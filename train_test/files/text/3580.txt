Introduction
Students pursuing studies in academic institutions (particu-
larly, universities) both at the undergraduate and postgradu-
ate levels are required to conduct an independent piece of
research and present in the form of a dissertation or thesis as
part of the requirements for awarding academic degrees. It is
expedient at this stage to explain what research means and its
types because that provides a context for the ensuing dis-
course. Research is a careful, systematic, and patient investi-
gation in some field of knowledge, undertaken to establish
facts or principles; it is a structured inquiry that utilizes an
acceptable scientific methodology to collect, analyze, and
interpret information to solve problems or answer questions
and to create new knowledge that is generally applicable
(Burns, 1997; Grinnell, 1993; Kumar, 2011). Similarly,
according to Research Assessment Exercise (2005), research
is an original and systematic inquiry or investigation into a
subject to gain knowledge and understanding of a phenome-
non. Research can, therefore, simply be described as a jour-
ney embarked upon that leads to the discovery of new
knowledge or revision of facts, theories, and applications.
Thus, any research conducted must make an original contri-
bution to the existing body of knowledge in the relevant
discipline.
There are two main types of research, which are scien-
tific/academic research and research that is more or less car-
ried out by people in their daily lives, known as common
sense research. In distinguishing between these two types of
research, Lundberg (1942) explains that nearly all people in
the course of their daily lives may systematically observe,
classify, and interpret data, which is a form of research. For
instance, a potential purchaser of a particular model of a car
may systematically investigate about the performance of the
car before finally making a decision to purchase it and this
constitutes research. Lundberg, however, observes that this

Essential Ingredients of a Good Research
Proposal for Undergraduate and
Postgraduate Students in the Social
Sciences
Raymond Talinbe Abdulai1 and Anthony Owusu-Ansah2
Abstract
As part of the requirements for the award of degrees in higher education institutions, students at undergraduate and
postgraduate levels normally carry out research, which they report in the form of dissertations or theses. The research
journey commences with the selection of a research topic and the preparation of a proposal on the selected topic. Experience
has shown that students tend to encounter difficulties in writing research proposals for their supervisors because they do not
fully comprehend what constitutes a research proposal. The purpose of this article is to take students through a step-by-step
process of writing good research proposals by discussing the essential ingredients of a good research proposal. Thus, it is not
a didactic piece--the aim is to guide students in research proposal writing. In discussing these ingredients, relevant examples
are provided where necessary for ease of understanding. It is expected that on reading this article, students should be able to:
(a) demonstrate knowledge and understanding of what research is all about and its challenging nature; (b) display an enlarged
comprehension of research gap(s), problem or question(s), aim, objectives, and hypotheses as well as their distinguishing
characteristics; (c) demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant elements to be considered in the constituent sections
of a good research proposal; and (d) comprehend the elements of a research proposal that should feature in the final written
dissertation or thesis.

type of research is different from scientific research because
of the degree of formality, rigorousness, verifiability, and
general validity of the latter. The essential features of aca-
demic research are that it should, as far as possible, be con-
trolled, rigorous, valid and verifiable, empirical, critical
(Kumar, 2011), reliable, systematic, arguable, and
challengeable.
Regarding the concept of control, in real life, many fac-
tors can affect an outcome and, therefore, in exploring the
causality in relation to, for example, two variables, it is
important that the study is set up in a manner that minimizes
the effects of other factors affecting the relationship (Kumar,
2011). This, Kumar notes, can be achieved to a large extent
in the physical sciences because most of the research is con-
ducted in a laboratory setting. He, however, opines that in the
social sciences, it can be extremely difficult to control exter-
nal factors as the research is carried out on issues relating to
human beings living in a society where such controls are
impossible and it will, thus, be necessary to quantify their
impact. It appears, Kumar assumes, that such impacts can
always be quantified. However, it might not be possible in all
cases and even where they can be quantified, an issue that
may arise will relate to the appropriate technique to be used
and these constitute some of the challenges in the research
process.
In terms of the rigorousness of academic research, scru-
pulousness on the part of the research is required to ensure
the procedures followed to address problems or find answers
to questions are relevant, appropriate, and justified (Kumar,
2011; Lundberg, 1942). These authors observe that the
degree of rigor will vary markedly between the physical and
social sciences. The concept of validity and verifiability
implies that the conclusions, which are made based on the
research findings, should be correct and can be verified by
the researcher and others (Kumar, 2011). Validity is about the
study's success at measuring or investigating what the
researcher sets out to measure or investigate (internal valid-
ity) and the extent to which the research findings can be
applied to new settings (external validity) (Bell & Bryman,
2011; Bryman, 2012; Bryman & Cramer, 2005; Creswell,
2003, 2009; Curtis & Curtis, 2011; Lincoln & Guba, 2000;
Szafram, 2012). Albeit other types of validity exist, it suf-
fices that only internal and external validity is mentioned
because the object is to briefly define the concept.
Reliability refers to the extent to which a test or any mea-
suring procedure yields the same results on repeated trials
(Bell & Bryman, 2011; Bryman, 2012; Creswell, 2003, 2009;
Creswell & Miller, 2000; Curtis & Curtis, 2011; Farrell,
2011; Krippendorff, 2013; Lincoln & Guba, 2000). It is,
therefore, about consistency. It is when research procedures
or tools used by different researchers yield consistent mea-
surements that researchers are able to satisfactorily draw
conclusions, formulate theories, or make claims about the
generalizability of their research findings (Creswell, 2003,
2009). Thus, the importance of reliability in academic
research cannot be over-emphasized as it determines the
validity of research findings. In terms of empirical issues,
any conclusions drawn should be based on hard evidence
collected from real-life experiences or observations (Kumar,
2011). It, however, needs to be noted that in conducting aca-
demic research, not all data will be based on real-life experi-
ences or observations as there can be desktop research, which
is considered later. Regarding critical issues, critical scrutiny
of the procedures or methods used is crucial to a research
inquiry; that is, the process and procedures adopted must be
able to withstand critical scrutiny (Kumar, 2011).
Academic research is also systematic, arguable, and chal-
lengeable. This is because what is to be addressed or investi-
gated [that is, the research problem or question(s)] must, first
of all, be established based on the research gap(s) identified
in the relevant literature. Second, how the research problem
or question(s) are to be addressed has to be determined.
Third, data will be collected, presented, and analyzed using
appropriate data analysis tools and the research findings dis-
cussed. Finally, conclusions and appropriate recommenda-
tions will be made. Thus, conducting research is a systematic
process that involves the realization of milestones and deliv-
erables. As aptly observed by Kumar (2011), the procedures
adopted to undertake an investigation follow a certain logical
sequence and, therefore, the different steps cannot be taken
in a haphazard manner--some procedures must follow oth-
ers. Timescales and resources for research are normally tight.
Any research to be conducted will be time-bound and, thus,
the researcher has no infinite time, neither has he got limit-
less resources for the research; these constitute challenges
that are normally referred to as research limitations or con-
straints. Other research challenges that might be encountered
in the research process include issues relating to the particu-
lar research methodology used and accessibility to data. It is,
thus, very important to comprehend these research chal-
lenges and to acknowledge them in the research process.
There are two main forms of academic research based on
the sources of data. The first one is desktop research, which
is any research conducted where the source of data is solely
published and unpublished materials; that is, the research
relies heavily on secondary data. Examples will include
information from books, journal articles, published and
unpublished dissertations and theses, reports, databases,
newspapers, and magazines. The second one is empirical
research where data are gathered via direct experience,
observation, experimentation, interviews, and question-
naires--this type of research, therefore, uses mainly primary
data. It is possible to conduct academic research, which is an
amalgam of the two and, therefore, they are not watertight
closed boxes.
The preoccupation of this article is academic research
since it is that type of research that students in universities
are normally required to conduct and report in a dissertation
or thesis form. The research journey normally commences
with the selection of a research topic from a subject or an
Abdulai and Owusu-Ansah 3
area of interest and the preparation of a research proposal on
the selected topic. A research proposal clarifies the thoughts
of the researcher. Furthermore, it aids him to organize his
ideas into a coherent statement of research intent regarding
what is to be investigated, how it will be investigated, and the
significance/importance of what is to be investigated. It also
offers him an opportunity to convince an assessor or any
other reader that the proposed research can be conducted
within a given time frame and resources.
The purpose of this article is to discuss the essential ingre-
dients of a good research proposal. The experience of the
authors in teaching research methodology and supervising
students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels
shows that students tend to find it difficult understanding the
essential ingredients of a research proposal and for that mat-
ter, find it difficult to write good research proposals. Thus,
there is the need to explain such ingredients in more detail
and to provide relevant examples where necessary for ease of
comprehension. The article is, therefore, not a didactic
piece--rather, the purpose is to guide students in research
proposal writing. These ingredients are research topic,
research background and gap(s), research aim and objec-
tives, research methodology, research significance/impor-
tance, research program, and references, which are treated in
that order. Elements of the research proposal that are sup-
posed to feature in the final written dissertation or thesis are
also considered before the article is concluded.
Research Topic
As indicated above, the research proposal is prepared on a
selected research topic but the topic will emanate from an
area of interest.An area of interest could, for instance, be real
estate management or construction management. Such broad
subject areas will form the basis of a preliminary exploration
to be carried out about the subject by reading the relevant
literature. The preliminary reading enables the potential
researcher to familiarize himself with the subject area and to
help him gain a sense of its scope and complexity. Once
some background knowledge is gained, the next stage is to
narrow the subject area by formulating a topic that can be
thoroughly investigated within a given period of time. At the
topic formulation stage, the potential researcher should be
able to articulate at least a tentative topic for the research to
be conducted. Selecting a topic via this route can serve as a
motivator and driver for the research. Topics that seem inter-
esting and perhaps meet the career aspirations of the student
can be identified and pursued. In using this route, it may be
helpful to confer with colleagues and lecturers in terms of
what one intends to pursue for their input.Admittedly, select-
ing a topic through this route takes a lot of time.
Regarding, particularly, undergraduate and master's dis-
sertations there is another route for selecting a research topic.
This is where students fashion their topics based on the
research interests of particular lecturers; indeed, a list of
topics from lecturers based on their research interests may be
available for the students to choose from. One advantage
with this route is that the student is able to settle on a topic
within a shorter period of time in comparison with the first
one above. The other advantage is that in the supervision
process, the lecturer will be in a much better position to offer
expert advice providing the student who has chosen one of
the topics of a particular lecturer is allocated to that lecturer
to supervise. This significantly enhances the quality of super-
vision and ultimately contributes in enhancing student satis-
faction and experience. However, the latter advantage cannot
be achieved if the student is not finally allocated to the lec-
turer whose topic has been chosen by the student and this
happens in some cases in universities. The experience of the
authors in coordinating dissertations also shows that this
route to selecting research topics can be problematic in some
cases, especially, when the student is facing difficulties in the
course of conducting the research; they tend to use the fact
that the topics were given to them by their lecturers as an
alibi for their problems.
Whichever route is used to select a topic, it is very impor-
tant to seriously consider the availability of relevant data and
its accessibility for the research in the decision making pro-
cess. Table 1 provides examples of good and bad research
topics.
Research Background
Various terms are used to describe the research background
or background to research section, for example, "broad dis-
cussion" (Holt, 1998), "rationale" (Hart, 2001; Naoum,
2013), "purpose" (Naoum, 2006), and "introduction."
Research is conducted to address an existing problem or
question(s), which has not been addressed before and, there-
fore, irrespective of the terminology that is used to describe
the section, it provides a context for the research, by identify-
ing the research problem or research question(s), which
requires a kind of mini literature review. Thus, the terminol-
ogy used to describe the section does not actually matter. A
literature review is a "systematic, explicit, and reproducible
method of identifying, evaluating, and synthesising the exist-
ing body of completed and recorded work produced by
researchers, scholars, and practitioners" (Fink, 2005, cited in
Booth, Papaioannou, & Sutton, 2012, pp. 2-3). In other
words, it is a process of searching and describing or critically
analyzing any secondary data that relate to a particular sub-
ject, field, discipline, or topic. Thus, a literature review is
simply about making references to the works of other people
either in a descriptive or critical and analytical manner. It is a
process and there are two types: descriptive literature review
and critical and analytical literature review.
Based on what literature review means, it is inappropriate
to use "literature review" as a title or heading of a section in
a research proposal or a chapter in a dissertation or thesis
albeit it is commonly used that way. For instance, Naoum
4 SAGE Open
(2013) has used it as a section heading in a sample research
proposal. In writing a research proposal, dissertation, or the-
sis, elements of literature review can be found in any section
or chapter once references are cited in that section or chapter
even if it is a single reference that is cited. Under the research
background section of a research proposal, for example, a
mini literature review will be conducted, but the section is
titled "research background" and not "literature review."
Similarly, in the research methodology chapter of a research
proposal, dissertation, or thesis, references will be cited but
the chapter will not be titled "literature review." It will be
appropriately titled, "research methodology." Also in MPhil
and PhD theses, a chapter on a theoretical framework for the
study is an imperative but the chapter will be titled "theoreti-
cal framework" although it will be a literature review. Indeed,
in the empirical data presentation, analysis, and discussion
chapter(s) of a dissertation or thesis, there can be elements of
literature review; for example, a researcher may establish a
finding and compare it with previous findings and in this
instance, the reference(s) for the previous findings will be
cited. Therefore, it does not make any sense to title a particu-
lar section or chapter "literature review"; rather, an appropri-
ate title or heading that captures the contents of the section or
chapter should be used.
A literature review serves various purposes, which have
been identified by Kumar (2011) and Booth et al. (2012) as
follows: It (a) provides a theoretical background for the
research, (b) broadens the researcher's knowledge base and
brings clarity and focus to the research problem, (c) helps to
establish the nexus between what is proposed to be researched
and what has already been studied, (d) improves research
methodology, and (e) enables the researcher to show how his
findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge and,
therefore, helps to contextualize the research findings.
Purposes (b) and (c) are of more relevance here--the ratio-
nale for a literature review under the research background
section is to establish the links between what has already
been researched and what is proposed to be researched,
thereby, broadening the researcher's knowledge base as well
as to bring more clarity and focus to the research problem or
research question(s).
The term mini literature review is used in the present con-
text to differentiate it from the main analytical and critical
literature review that will be presented in the final disserta-
tion or thesis. The mini literature review provides an over-
view of the key literature sources from which the ultimate
main research will draw. Thus, it is the mini literature review
that will finally be expanded when the dissertation or thesis
is being written. Research background is the heartbeat of a
research proposal and the researcher needs to demonstrate
his knowledge of the relevant literature both past and present
by clearly articulating what other researchers have done in
relation to the topic to be investigated, what they have found,
and what aspects have not been researched, known as
research gap(s).
Thus, a clear line between previous studies that have been
carried out and the research to be undertaken must be shown.
In short, the proposed research should be the point

of departure from the existing knowledge; that is, what the
proposed research will do that is different from what has
been done before must be demonstrated. The overarching
aim of the research background section is, therefore, to
establish research gap(s), which will then form the basis of
the research problem or question(s) to be addressed. Research
gap(s) may take two main forms as follows.
A Situation Where No Research Has Been
Conducted in Relation to the Topic Under
Consideration
Where this situation is established via the mini literature
review, it will form the basis of the research problem or
question(s). This may easily apply to the physical sciences.
However, in the social sciences, it may be difficult (although
not impossible) for it to apply as invariably; a form of
research would have been conducted in relation to a topic.
However, where it is possible to establish that research has
never been conducted in relation to a particular topic under
consideration, it will form the research gap.
A Situation Where Research Has Been
Conducted Into a Topic Under Consideration
but to a Certain Extent or From a Particular
Perspective
It is this situation that normally applies in the social sciences.
Under this broad form of research gap, different sub-research
gaps can be encountered including those discussed below.
Historical. The research gap can be historical where research
has been conducted on a topic a long time ago with no other
research conducted on the topic since then. The same topic
could be researched today as it is possible that with the
effluxion of time, the conditions that existed at the time of
the original investigation into the topic might have changed.
Where a topic has been researched from the perspective of a
particular discipline.For example, a topic could have been
investigated by a planner but has never been considered by
an economist and, thus, it can be investigated by the econo-
mist from the perspective of economics. Because these
researchers will have different subject backgrounds, they
will be wearing different lenses and, therefore, will investi-
gate the topic from different perspectives in accordance with
their training.
Where a topic has been researched in relation to a particular
geographical location. Regarding this situation, a topic could
have, for instance, been investigated using Holland as a case
study but research has never been conducted into that topic
using Italy as a case study--this will, therefore, constitute a
research gap. It could even apply to the same country where
research would have been carried out on a particular issue
using a particular city or town as a case study and the same
research could be conducted using a different city or town
within the same country. Albeit it will be the same topic that
is being investigated, the conditions in the different countries
or different parts of the same country will be different, which
will influence the research.
Comparing issues. A fourth form of research gap will relate to
comparing issues. Thus, from the literature to be reviewed, it
will be possible to discover that research has never been con-
ducted on a topic already investigated on a comparative basis
and this will be a research gap. This form of research gap
could, for example, relate to geographical locations where
research has never been carried out on a topic on a compara-
tive basis using different geographical locations.
Where a topic has two or more dimensions but research has only
been conducted in relation to one or some of them. For instance,
an issue such as constraints of accessibility to formal capital
for investment will have demand and supply side constraints.
It is, therefore, possible that although a lot of research would
have been conducted on this issue, all the studies might have
concentrated on, for example, the demand side in various
countries with no research that has looked at the supply side
constraints. This will, thus, constitute a research gap.
When the mini literature review is being carried out, it is
the above forms of research gaps that one needs to be search-
ing. Once the research gap(s) are established, an appropriate
research problem can be formulated. The research problem
formulation is a very critical stage in the research process. As
Kerlinger (1986) aptly and succinctly puts it, "If one wants to
solve a problem, one must generally know what the problem
is. It can be said that a large part of the problem lies in know-
ing what one is trying to do" (p. 17). The researcher needs to
have a clear idea regarding what he wants to find out about
and not what he thinks he must find (Kumar, 2011). However,
what the prospective researcher wants to find about should
not have been investigated in the existing literature. An issue
or phenomenon becomes a research problem because it exists
and has not been researched (or some aspects of it have not
been researched) before. Consequently, the mere fact that an
issue or phenomenon exists does not make it a research prob-
lem--for the issue to become a research problem, the poten-
tial researcher needs to demonstrate that the phenomenon has
not been investigated or some aspects of it have not been
investigated in the existing literature. Thus, for all intents
and purposes, the research problem is simply, a re-articula-
tion of the research gap(s), which can alternatively be stated
by posing relevant research question(s) that have to be
answered. The research problem or research question(s) will
in turn form the basis of the research aim and objectives for
investigation.
It is important to end the research background section
with a statement of the research problem or research
6 SAGE Open
question(s). The research problem or research question(s)
can also be stated in a sub-section of its own. Indeed, the
whole research background section need not be presented in
a monolithic manner. It can have sub-sections with appropri-
ate headings as required. It is possible to identify two or
more problems or questions from the mini literature review.
However, when this scenario arises but the researcher wishes
to concentrate on some of the research problems or ques-
tions, the research scope or boundary needs to be defined or
clearly stated to show, which of them will be addressed in the
research. Due to the fact that a form of literature has to be
reviewed, relevant references must be cited in this section.
Therefore, personal unsubstantiated statements cannot be the
basis of research gap(s) and for that matter, research problem
or research question(s).
Research Aim and Objectives
The experience of the authors bespeaks that some students
tend to have difficulties differentiating between research aim
and objectives. A research aim is basically a purpose state-
ment that defines the trajectory or route and destination of
research. It is simply a catchy re-statement of the research
topic and, thus, when the research topic has been appropri-
ately phrased and very clear, it is easy to state the research
aim. The research aim is meant to address the research
problem or question(s). It needs to be clearly stated in one to
three sentences and only one research aim is needed even at
the master's and PhD levels because as earlier indicated, a
research aim is catchy re-statement of the research topic and
the researcher will be dealing with only one research topic.
The realization of the research aim will, however, require
the pursuit of individual measurable objectives, which should
also be clearly stated. Thus, research objectives are a transla-
tion of the aim into operational statements and tell the reader
how the overall research aim will be realized or achieved. In
the statement of research objectives, specificity and unambi-
guity are important; that is, the objectives need to be specific
and should be stated in an unambiguous manner. In addition,
research objectives need to be realistic and it should be pos-
sible to investigate them within a specified period of time
because, as already noted supra, research will have to be car-
ried out within a given time frame. The research objectives
should leave the reader in no doubt as to what the proposed
research precisely seeks to investigate.
Research objectives could be stated in bullet points or
numbered and typically between three and five objectives
will suffice even at the PhD level. Research aim and objec-
tives are appropriately phrased using verbs such as "to inves-
tigate," "to examine," "to evaluate," "to assess," "to
determine," "to develop," "to measure," "to explore," and so
on. Such verbs are used to show that the research is "do-
able" (Farrell, 2011) and will be critical and analytical in
nature rather than descriptive. Examples are shown in
Table 2.
It is not uncommon to see statements such as the follow-
ing: "to gain knowledge and understanding or to understand
. . ." (see, for example, Farrell, 2011) and "to make recom-
mendations" as statements of research objectives. However,
such statements cannot be research objectives. Regarding the
first phrase, the overarching purpose of conducting research
is to gain knowledge and understanding of a phenomenon or
to understand a phenomenon or issue but that knowledge and
understanding is gained after research objectives have been
investigated and it is those objectives that need to be formu-
lated and stated. Similarly, in terms of the second phrase,
recommendations are made after research objectives have
been investigated and based on the research findings. Thus,
recommendations are an end product of investigating objec-
tives. When research is conducted and reported, recommen-
dations will be made any way and so it is needless to tell the
reader the obvious.
It is also not uncommon to see research objectives and
hypotheses (hypothesis for singular) stated in dissertations or
theses, and indeed, authors such as Farrell (2011) and Naoum
(2013) create the impression that research objectives and
hypotheses need to be stated in a research proposal. This,
however, is problematic. A hypothesis has been defined by
Kinnear and Gray (1994, 2008) as a provisional supposition
that a variable has a causal effect on another variable. It is a
suggested explanation for a group of facts or phenomenon
either accepted as a basis for further verification or accepted
as likely to be true (Holt, 1998). Fellows and Liu (2008) also
define it as a statement, conjecture, speculation, or an educa-
tive guess, which is a reasonable suggestion of a causal rela-
tionship between two variables.
Based on the above definitions, a hypothesis can be
described as a testable proposition about the relationship that
exists between two or more variables, concepts, or events. A
null hypothesis means there is no relationship between the
variables, concepts, or events. It is a research objective that
is re-phrased as a research hypothesis and vice versa. For
example, an objective such as "to examine the impact of
price on demand for goods and services" (which can also be
phrased as "to investigate the extent to which price affects
the demand for goods and services") could be re-phrased into
a hypothesis such as "price affects the demand for goods and
services" or "price is a determinant of demand for goods and
services." Thus, once research objectives are stated, it is not
necessary to state hypotheses or when hypotheses are stated,
it is needless to state research objectives; stating the two will
be tautological. Research objectives or hypotheses serve the
same purpose. Normally, research objectives are investigated
while hypotheses are tested but the process of investigating
research objectives or testing hypotheses is the same and the
end results are also the same.
Statement of research objectives or hypotheses (but not
both) in a research proposal and for that matter, in a disserta-
tion or thesis is a sine qua non. This is because the research
objectives or hypotheses drive or determine the rest of what
Abdulai and Owusu-Ansah 7
is to be done. The chapters on: (a) critical and analytical
review of the main literature (an expansion of the mini litera-
ture review in the research proposal) including the develop-
ment of an appropriate theoretical framework (for MPhil and
PhD theses); (b) research methodology; (c) data presenta-
tion, analysis, and discussion; and (d) summary of research
findings or conclusions, limitations, and recommendations
will all be based on the research objectives or hypotheses.
For example, a discussion of the research methodology
including the design of research instrument for data collec-
tion must be linked to the research objectives or hypotheses
and the research objectives or hypotheses will form the
themes in data presentation, analysis, and discussion.
Furthermore, in the summary of research findings or conclu-
sions, limitations, and recommendations chapter, the sum-
mary of research findings will be linked to the research
objectives or hypotheses to establish the extent to which the
objectives or hypotheses have been investigated or tested. It
is, therefore, inconceivable for a dissertation or theses not to
have research objectives or hypotheses.
Thus, in summary, first of all, the research problem or
research question(s) are to be identified and stated based on
the research gap(s) established in the mini literature review.
Second, to address the research problem or questions(s), a
research aim is formulated. Finally, to realize the research
aim, specific, unambiguous, measurable, achievable, realis-
tic, and time-bound (SUMART) individual objectives are
formulated to be investigated or alternatively, hypotheses are
formulated to be tested. This order of activities is illustrated
diagrammatically in Figure 1.

The order of research problem or question(s), aim, and
objectives has been considered by Naoum (2013). However,
Naoum's order is problematic as he appears to be putting the
cart before the horse, particularly, where he places research
questions as follows: research aim; research objectives; and
key research questions. Naoum's order of activities suggests
that it is the research questions that address research objec-
tives, when it is the other way round. As noted earlier,
research is conducted to address a particular research prob-
lem or questions. Thus, the research problem or question(s)
must first of all be established at the outset based on the
research gap(s) and when this is done, the research aim and
objectives or hypotheses will then be formulated to address
the research problem or questions(s). Therefore, research
objectives or hypotheses are investigated or tested to achieve
the research aim and once the research aim is realized or
achieved, it implies the research problem or question(s)
would have been addressed and for that matter, the research
gap(s) would have also been filled. Consequently, diagram-
matically, the arrows in Figure 1 will be reversed from the
base as follows in Figure 2.
Research Methodology
The research aim and objectives or hypotheses that are based
on the research problem or question(s) considered above will
tell the reader what exactly the researcher intends or wants to
investigate. This section offers the researcher the opportunity
to explain how the research will be carried out. Thus, research
methodology (also known as research approach) is the strat-
egy of investigation, which is about the whole dissertation or
thesis from the beginning to the end including how the
research objectives have been founded from the research
problem, how the literature review has been carried out, pilot
studies, data collection, analytical methods, and the process
of developing findings and conclusions (Farrell, 2011). It is,
therefore, a gamut of various issues that are: (a) strategies
of inquiry; (b) theoretical/secondary and primary data
collection; (c) sampling issues; (d) construction of research
instrument for primary data collection (design of question-
naires and interview schedules or guides), data collection
procedures (research methods), ethics, and pilot studies; (e)
data presentation, analysis, and discussion; and (f) validation
of research findings. In this section, the elements of research
methodology are treated at a theoretical level first to provide
an appropriate context before a consideration of what needs
to be incorporated in the research methodology section in a
research proposal.
In the social sciences, there are three research methodolo-
gies that can be used to conduct academic research. These
are: (a) quantitative research methodology, also known as the
traditional, positivist, or empiricist research approach; (b)
qualitative research methodology, which is variously referred
to as the constructivist, naturalistic, interpretative, postposi-
tivist, or postmodern perspective approach; and (c) mix
methodologies and the other terminologies for it are multi-
methodology and pragmatic approach--it is an amalgam of
quantitative and qualitative research methodologies in one
study. The distinguishing features of quantitative and quali-
tative research methodologies are provided in Table 3.
Research methodology is considered by some authors to
be the same as research design whereas others treat research
design as a sub-set of research methodology. Kumar (2011),
for example, defines a research design as a plan, structure,
and strategy of investigation so conceived as to obtain
answers to research problems or questions. Thus, he consid-
ers research methodology to be the same as research design
where he differentiates between qualitative and quantitative
research designs (also see, for example, Kerlinger, 1986, and
Creswell, 2009, 2013). However, the explanation of research
design by authors such as Thyer (1993), Selltiz et al. (1962),
Bell and Bryman (2011), and Bryman (2012) shows that it is
a sub-set of research methodology. Bryman (2012), for
instance, defines it as the framework for collecting data and
analysis--the focus here is only data collection and analysis.
Albeit the literature is ambivalent regarding the distinction
between research methodology and research design, the
authors of this article are of the opinion that they are the
same and can be used interchangeably.
Regarding research paradigm and methodology, there is a
difference between them. A research paradigm is a collection
of assumptions and beliefs that guide the path of conducting
research and interpreting findings (Koshy, Koshy, &
Waterman, 2010). Thus, it can be described as a matrix of
theoretical mind-sets that underpin a research methodology
or approach. For example, an assumption in the quantitative
research methodology is that knowledge (epistemology) is
real and exists (ontology) there in the world that can be
objectively and quantitatively measured and that is an ele-
ment of a research paradigm in the quantitative research
methodology. Epistemological and ontological issues are
treated later. In terms of the qualitative research methodol-
ogy, the assumption is that knowledge is real and exists there

in the world that can be subjectively and qualitatively mea-
sured and that is also an element of a research paradigm in
the qualitative research methodology.
Strategies of Inquiry
Various types exist in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed
methodologies, which have been considered by authors such
as Clandinin and Connelly (2000), Babbie (2000), Creswell
(2003, 2007, 2009, 2013), Bell and Bryman (2011), Farrell
(2011), Grbich (2013), Naoum (2013), Urquhart (2013), and
Coghlan and Brannick (2014), and summarized as follows.
Surveys.A survey is a system of gathering information and
includes cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that use
mostly questionnaires, interviews, and observation for data
collection. In a cross-sectional survey, all the data on rele-
vant variables are collected at the same time or within a rela-
tively short time frame. It, therefore, provides a snapshot of
the variables included in the investigation at one particular
point in time. However, in longitudinal surveys, data are
collected over long periods of time. Measurements are taken
on each variable over two or more distinct time periods.
This permits the measurement of change in variables over
time.
Experiments. The basic intent of an experiment is to test the
impact of a treatment or an intervention on an outcome (the
effect--dependent variable), while controlling all other fac-
tors (the determinants or causes--independent variables)
that might influence that outcome. Experimental strategies
are normally used in the physical sciences where the experi-
ments are laboratory-based. However, they can be used in the
social sciences--when they are used in the social sciences,
the experiment is field-based.
Ethnography.This is where the researcher studies an intact
cultural group in a natural setting over a prolonged period of
time by collecting primarily observational data. The research
process is flexible and typically evolves contextually in
response to the lived realities encountered in the field
setting.
Table 3. Characteristics of Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methodologies.
Quantitative research methodology Qualitative research methodology
1 It is an inquiry into a social or human problem based
normally on testing a theory composed of variables,
measured with numbers, and analyzed using statistical
procedures to determine whether the predictive
generalizations of the theory hold true.
It is an inquiry process of comprehending a social or human
problem based on building a complex holistic picture formed with
words, reporting detailed views of informants and conducted in a
natural setting.
2 It views truthfulness or reality to exist in the world,
which can be objectively measured.
It views truthfulness or reality to exist in the world that can be
subjectively measured.
3 In terms of the relationship between the investigator and
what is being investigated, the quantitative research
methodology holds that the researcher should remain
distant and independent of what is being researched to
ensure an objective assessment of the situation.
The inquirer normally goes to the site of the target participants
to conduct the research. This enables the researcher to develop
a level of detail about the individual or place and to be highly
involved in the actual experiences of the participants.
4 It is not value-laden as the researchers' values are kept
out of the study.
It is value-laden as the personal self becomes inseparable from the
researcher self.
5 The entire process uses the deductive form of reasoning
or logic wherein theories and hypotheses are tested
in cause-and-effect order. Concepts, variables, and
hypotheses are chosen before the study begins and
remain fixed throughout the study. The intent of the
study is to develop generalizations that contribute
to the theory and that enable one to better predict,
explain, and comprehend a phenomenon.
The reasoning adopted in qualitative research is largely inductive.
Various aspects or categories emerge from those under
investigation rather than are identified a priori by the researcher.
This emergence provides information leading to patterns or
theories that help explain a phenomenon. Theory or hypotheses
are, therefore, not established a priori. The research objectives
may change and be refined as the inquirer learns what question
to ask and to whom. The methodology is, therefore, emergent
rather than tightly pre-figured.
6 Regarding research methods (particularly, primary data
collection procedures), questionnaires are used and
the questions asked are largely closed-ended where
optional responses are provided.
Interviews are used for primary data collection and the questions
asked are mainly open-ended where no optional responses are
provided.
7 There is descriptive and inferential numeric analysis of
data using statistical packages.
Collection of text data, description, and analysis of text or pictures/
images, representation of information in figures and tables, all
inform qualitative research. Data are coded and analyzed using
qualitative software packages.

10 SAGE Open
Grounded theory. In grounded theory, the researcher attempts
to derive a theory of a process, action, behavior, or interac-
tion grounded in the views of participants in the study. This
process involves multiple stages of data collection and the
refinement and interrelationship of categories of
information.
Case study.It is an in-depth systematic investigation of a
phenomenon (which can be a program, an event, an activity,
a process, a geographical location, one or more individuals,
etc.) by a researcher. The cases are bounded by time and
activity and researchers collect detailed information using a
variety of data collection procedures over a sustained period
of time.
Phenomenology. It is the study of everyday life. In phenome-
nological studies, the investigator identifies the "essence" of
human experiences concerning a phenomenon as described
by participants in a study. Comprehending the "lived experi-
ences" marks phenomenology as a philosophy as well as an
approach and the procedure involves studying a small num-
ber of subjects or participants via extensive and prolonged
engagement to develop patterns and relationships of mean-
ing. In this process, the researcher "brackets" his experiences
to understand those of the participants in the study.
Narrative research.It is a form of inquiry in which the
researcher studies the lives of individuals and asks one or
more individuals to provide stories about their lives. The
information is then re-told or re-storied by the researcher into
a narrative chronology.
Action research. Action research, variously known as partici-
patory action research, community-based study, co-operative
inquiry, action science, problem-solving research, and action
learning, is the study of a social situation carried out by those
involved in that situation to improve both their practice and
the quality of their understanding of the situation. Practitio-
ners, industrialists, and students from the professional back-
grounds normally adopt this strategy of inquiry by identifying
a problem in the course of their work and to investigate it in
order to propose changes that will improve an existing
situation.
Sequential procedure. Inasequentialprocedure,theresearcher
seeks to elaborate on or expand the findings of one research
methodology with another research methodology. This may
involve beginning with a qualitative research methodology
for exploratory purposes and following up with a quantita-
tive research methodology. When the researcher begins with
qualitative research methodology followed by quantitative
research methodology, it is termed a sequential exploratory
strategy. Here, priority is given to the qualitative aspect of
the study. The findings of the two phases are then integrated
during the interpretation phase. The purpose of this strategy
is to use quantitative data and results to assist in interpreting
qualitative findings.
Alternatively, the study may begin with a quantitative
research approach followed by the collection and analysis of
qualitative data. Priority is typically given to the quantitative
data and the two research methodologies are integrated dur-
ing the interpretation phase of the study. This procedure is
termed a sequential explanatory strategy. The purpose of a
sequential explanatory strategy typically is to use qualitative
results to assist in explaining and interpreting the findings of
a primarily quantitative study. It is better suited for explain-
ing relationships. It can be, especially, useful when unex-
pected results arise from a quantitative study. In this case, the
qualitative data collection that follows can be used to exam-
ine these surprising results in more detail.
Concurrent procedure.Unlike a sequential procedure above
where the researcher begins with one methodology and fol-
lows with another in stages, in a concurrent procedure, the
investigator converges quantitative and qualitative data to
provide a comprehensive analysis of the research problem.
In this design, the investigator collects both quantitative and
qualitative data at the same time during the data collection
stage and then integrates the information in the analysis and
interpretation of the overall results. The researcher may nest
one form of data within another and this is called a concur-
rent nested strategy. Given less priority, a quantitative
research methodology is embedded or nested within a promi-
nent qualitative research methodology or the vice versa. This
nesting may mean that the embedded research methodology
addresses a different issue than the dominant research meth-
odology or seeks information from different levels. The data
collected from the two research methodologies are mixed
during the analysis phase of the project.
The concurrent nested strategy is often used so that the
researcher can gain broader perspectives as a result of using
two approaches rather than using only one research method-
ology. For example, a primarily qualitative research design
could embed some quantitative data to enrich the description
of the sample participants.
Transformative procedure.In this procedure, the researcher
uses a theoretical lens as an overarching perspective within a
research design that contains both quantitative and qualita-
tive data. The theoretical perspective can be based on, for
instance, ideologies such as advocacy. Within this lens could
be a data collection method that involves a sequential or con-
current strategy. The perspective is reflected in the research
problem or research question(s).
Reflection on strategies of inquiry. Sequential, concurrent, and
transformative procedures are strategies of inquiry in the
multi-methodology. However, in terms of the other strate-
gies, as Farrell (2011) aptly notes, they "are not closed
boxes" (p. 77) and can, therefore, fit into quantitative or
Abdulai and Owusu-Ansah 11
qualitative studies. For example, surveys and case studies
can be strategies in both quantitative and qualitative research.
Sometimes, surveys or case studies are referred to as research
methodology. However, from the preceding discourse, they
are not research methodologies by themselves--they are
rather strategies of inquiry within research methodologies.
In making a decision as to the methodology to use and
subsequently, the strategy of inquiry to adopt, researchers
need to consider their philosophical stance regarding episte-
mological and ontological issues (Koshy et al., 2010).
Epistemology is the theory of knowledge and it presents a
view and justification for what can be regarded as knowl-
edge; that is, what can be known and the criteria that knowl-
edge must satisfy to be called knowledge rather than beliefs
(Blaikie, 1993). What people say, how what they say is inter-
preted, and what they do are all important regarding, for
example, an action researcher for knowledge creation (Koshy
et al., 2010). Ontology, is about the theory of being and its
mandate is the development of strategies that can illuminate
the components of people's social reality; that is, about what
exists, what it looks like, the units that make it up, and how
these units interact with each other (Blaikie, 1993). For
instance, within action research, researchers would consider
this reality as socially constructed and not external and inde-
pendent and the stories they tell will be based on subjective
accounts from the people who live within their environ-
ment--thus, the methods of data collection they use will be
consistent with their ontological stance (Koshy et al., 2010).
Types of Data and Research Methods
As earlier indicated, there are two main types of data that can
be used in the above three research methodologies. These
are: (a) secondary data, which refers to any published and
unpublished material (e.g., materials from books, journals,
newspapers, reports, magazines, undergraduate and post-
graduate dissertations or theses, online materials, databases,
video and audio recordings, photographs, films, and com-
puter-based programs)--thus, a literature review is part of
secondary data collection; and (b) primary data--it is "first
hand" information gathered via procedures such as observa-
tion, interviews, questionnaires, and direct experiences. The
questionnaires (normally used in quantitative studies) can be
administered via mail/post, fax, Internet (web-based or
email), or face-to-face whereas interviews (often used in
qualitative studies) can be conducted face-to-face, over the
phone, or using a voice-over-IP service such as Skype.
Interviews can be unstructured, semi-structured, or struc-
tured, and the difference between them has been explained
by authors such as Abdulai (2010) and Naoum (2013) as fol-
lows. Unstructured interviews (also called intensive, infor-
mal, or in-depth interviews) are like journalistic interviews
with a guide prepared on the areas or issues one intends to
ask questions about. There are, therefore, no specific ques-
tions or specific order. The wording and sequence of
questions to be asked depend on the answers the respondent
gives to an initial question. It is assumed that the respondents
have particular experiences or are knowledgeable about
some subjects on which they can elaborate. The respondents
are, thus, referred to as key informants and purposively cho-
sen. Semi-structured interviews are more formal in compari-
son with unstructured interviews in that specific questions
are asked although they are not asked in any specific order
and normally, no interview schedule is used. Regarding
structured interviews, an interview schedule is prepared
where questions are presented in the same order and with the
same wording to all the respondents. Interviews can be con-
ducted on one-to-one or focus group basis. Focus groups/
group interviews are open discussions between members of a
group and the researcher.
It is the preceding data collection procedures that are
often referred to as research methods. The questionnaires
and interview schedules or guides prepared are known as the
research instrument for primary data collection.
Sampling Issues
In the collection of primary data, a sample population (sam-
ple size) is normally selected from the target total population
(sampling frame) and surveyed. In using questionnaires as
the research instrument and, particularly, where they are
administered via the Internet or post, one way to determine
the sample size is to distribute the questionnaires to all mem-
bers of the sampling frame or a pre-determined sub-popula-
tion of the sampling frame. The number of completed
questionnaires that are returned constitutes the response rate
and that becomes the sample size. However, in geographical
locations where the Internet or postal system is not well
developed, this technique of determining the sample size
may be difficult, if not impossible, to implement.
In the light of the above problem, other methods that can
be explored are probability and non-probability sampling
techniques. The other name for probability sampling is ran-
dom sampling. Random sampling generally incorporates
some type of systematic selection procedure to ensure that
each unit or element in the sampling frame has an equal
chance of being selected. The use of random sampling is
based on an implicit assumption that a sampling frame can
be established. Thus, where it is not possible to determine the
sampling frame or an adequate sampling fame does not exist,
random sampling cannot be used. Examples of random sam-
pling are simple random sampling, systematic sampling,
stratified sampling, and cluster sampling, which have been
extensively covered in the works of authors such as Morse
(1994) and Lincoln and Guba (2000).
Non-probability sampling focuses on volunteer potential
subjects, easily available potential subjects, or those who just
happen to be present when the research is carried out. There
is no any systematic selection procedure. Non-random sam-
ples are mostly used in qualitative studies, pilot studies, and
12 SAGE Open
market research, consulting with experts or in circumstances
where adequate sampling frames are unavailable (Lincoln &
Guba, 2000; Morse, 1994).Accidental, volunteer, quota, pur-
posive, and snowball sampling techniques are examples of
non-random sampling, which are also well treated by the
above authors.
Design of Research Instrument for Primary Data
Collection and Pilot Studies
In designing a research instrument, it is important to note that
questions are asked to solicit information that will enable the
investigation of research objectives (or testing of hypothe-
ses). There is, therefore, the need for the research instrument
to be explicitly linked to research objectives. When a ques-
tion is being constructed, it is critical to ask oneself how the
response to that question will help in investigating a particu-
lar research objective or part of it. Indeed, it might be useful
to sectionalize the whole research instrument thematically
based on the research objectives in order to ensure that most,
if not all, of the information that is needed to address the
objectives is obtained.
A pilot study is described by Bell (1996, cited in Naoum,
2013) as getting the bugs out of the research instrument so
that subjects in the main study will not experience difficul-
ties in completing it and for a preliminary analysis to be car-
ried out to determine whether or not the wording and format
of questions will present difficulties when the main data are
collected and analyzed. It, therefore, provides a trial run that
involves testing the wording of questions, identifying ambig-
uous questions, testing the data collection method, and mea-
suring the effectiveness of standard invitation to respondents
(Naoum, 2013). At the MPhil and PhD levels, a pilot study
can be carried out although this might not be possible for
undergraduate dissertations due to time constraints.
Ethical Issues
In conducting research (laboratory-based or field-based),
there is the need to normally ensure people are not harmed
physically or emotionally and that is what ethical consider-
ations are about. The researcher has a responsibility to ensure
that research participants are protected (O'Leary, 2013).
Apart from not doing harm, there is also the need to be truth-
ful to the process (Coghlan & Brannick, 2014). Curtis and
Curtis (2011) observe that the most important aspect of an
ethically appropriate research is voluntary informed consent.
In terms of recruiting participants, Curtis and Curtis explain
the following: voluntary as the notion of free will; informed
as referring to the provision of enough information about
what will be asked of them; and consent as the formal pro-
cess, which they affirm that they have been provided with all
the information they require and are agreeing to take part out
of their own free will. The process of gaining informed con-
sent includes the provision of a participant with information
sheet (PIS), which contains all the information the partici-
pant needs to make an informed decision about participation
(Curtis & Curtis, 2011; O'Leary, 2013). However, before
data collection commences, ethical approval will have to be
obtained from the researcher's institution.
Data Analysis and Validation of Research Findings
After gathering the relevant data for the research, it has to be
presented, analyzed, and discussed. A starting point is nor-
mally to clean, transcribe (if recordings were done during the
data collection stage), and to code the data in an appropriate
statistical package such as STATA or SPSS (quantitative
studies) or qualitative data analysis software package such as
NVivo (qualitative studies) for analysis. Content analysis can
be carried out where appropriate. It is a tool used to deter-
mine the presence of certain words or concepts within texts
or sets of texts by quantifying and analyzing the presence,
meanings, and relationships of such words and concepts
(Palmquist, Carley, & Dale, 1997). There are two types,
which are conceptual and relational analyses.
At an advanced level such as MPhil and doctoral studies,
it is important to validate research findings albeit this is not
normally required at the undergraduate or MSc levels. Two
common procedures that are used to validate findings are
explained as follows. One procedure is triangulation where
two or more techniques are used in the investigation of a
phenomenon to enhance confidence in the ultimate findings.
For example, the research methodologies, including data col-
lection procedures, data sources, and survey participants can
be triangulated to validate the findings. The second proce-
dure is to withhold a percentage of the data collected that is
then presented and analyzed later and compared with the ini-
tial findings. This procedure, however, appears problematic
as it is actually a continuation of data presentation, analysis,
and discussion and not research validation in the real sense
because it is the same data set that is used, just that the data
are analyzed at a different time.
What to Include in the Research Methodology
Section
Under the research methodology section, a detailed treat-
ment of all the research methodological issues is not needed
since it will be considered in the research methodology chap-
ter during the write-up stage of the dissertation or thesis.
What is required in this section is for the researcher to laconi-
cally demonstrate awareness of the research methodology
process in the social sciences in a logical manner. Thus, any
consideration of the theoretical issues should be as brief as
possible by concentrating on the important and salient issues
that will inform how the research will be conducted. The
research methodologies available in the social sciences
should be briefly explained and a justification provided for
the choice of a particular methodology.
Abdulai and Owusu-Ansah 13
The selection of a research methodology needs to be
explicitly linked to the research objectives or hypotheses.
Therefore, there is the need to explain clearly how each of
the research objectives will be investigated. If it is one
research methodology that will be adopted to investigate all
the stated research objectives, then the linkage will be obvi-
ous and does not need an explanation. However, where the
multi-methodology will be adopted, there has to be an expla-
nation regarding which research methodology will be used to
address which of the research objectives. For instance, if
there are four stated research objectives, the quantitative
research methodology might be used to investigate two of
the research objectives whereas the qualitative research
methodology may be used to investigate the remaining
research objectives, and this needs to be explained and justi-
fied. Following on, the strategy of inquiry, research methods,
and research instrument to be used, how the survey partici-
pants will be selected, and how the data to be collected will
be analyzed should be explicated. If a pilot study will be car-
ried out, it should be indicated. Also, it should be indicated
that ethical issues will be considered and that before the pri-
mary data collection process begins, ethical approval will be
obtained. Finally, it will be necessary to state that the first
part of the research methodology will consist of a critical
review of the relevant literature in order to, among other
things, identify the appropriate theoretical framework for the
research and to help in designing the rest of the research
methodology. Research methodology can be likened to the
"foundation" of a building in construction and, therefore,
needs to be robust; if it is weak, the research will also be
weak.
Research Significance/Importance
The importance of the research must be considered by justi-
fying the need for the research. This will require some refer-
ence to be made to the research gap(s), problem, or
question(s), and an explanation of how the proposed research
will contribute to existing body of knowledge (novelty) as
well as explaining how the outcomes of the research are
likely to benefit the following stakeholders where applica-
ble: (a) academia, (b) individuals and communities, (c)
industry and commerce, and (d) policymakers nationally and
internationally.
Research Program
As earlier indicated, time and resources regarding, particu-
larly, pecuniary legacy for the conduct of any research are
normally limited. Thus, there is the need for a research pro-
gram. It indicates the principal or milestone activities to be
carried out and the time line for such activities. The research
program will be used by the supervisor to monitor the prog-
ress made by the student once the research commences so
that any issues can be identified and addressed. The research
program can be indicated in a tabular form or diagrammati-
cally, for example, in the form of a Gantt chart and it can be
embedded in the research program section or added as an
appendix.
References
In the above sections, relevant references will have been
cited in-text where necessary in accordance with a particular
referencing style. It is in this section that the full references
will be provided in accordance with the same referencing
style used for the in-text citations. The references should be
listed in an alphabetical order. Sources from which one can
draw information are varied as alluded to above. However, it
is not advisable to rely heavily on websites as they are often
not considered a good source of materials. Thus, websites
should be used sparingly. The most highly regarded sources
of materials are academic journals (including online jour-
nals) and research monographs, followed by text books.
Quantity, quality, and currency of references are of impor-
tance here.
There can also be a bibliography section, which should be
titled "Bibliography" after the references section. The dic-
tionary definition does not differentiate between references
and bibliography. However, in academic writings, there is a
difference between the two albeit some authors use them
interchangeably perhaps based on the dictionary definition.
As Farrell (2011) explains, references are everything cited in
the dissertation. Thus, references that are specifically cited
in-text will be fully listed under references. However, Farrell
describes bibliography as everything that has been read or
browsed, which is relevant to the subject area but has not
been cited. It is, therefore, any material that is consulted to
help shape the ideas of the researcher but has not been used
in a manner to warrant in-text citation. For example, if a stu-
dent consults somebody's dissertation or thesis to gain ideas
regarding how to appropriately phrase a research topic, the
student cannot cite that person in stating his research topic in
his dissertation or thesis. However, to acknowledge that per-
son, the full reference to that dissertation or thesis will be
listed under bibliography. Similarly, references that may be
relevant to the research but have not been used in a manner
to warrant in-text citation will be listed under bibliography
for further reading.
Research Proposal Components That
Are Supposed to Feature in the Final
Thesis or Dissertation
Based on experience, some students, especially, at the under-
graduate and master's levels, reproduce all the contents of
the research proposal in the introductory chapter of the dis-
sertation, which is inappropriate. The introductory chapter is
named "Chapter One" and its title is "Introduction." The
main relevant sections in this chapter are: (a) research
14 SAGE Open
background; (b) research aim and objectives; (c) research
methodology; (d) summary of main research findings, limita-
tions, and recommendations; (e) research significance/impor-
tance; and (f) structure/organization of dissertation. The
introductory chapter serves a dual purpose by first, setting the
appropriate scene for the research conducted and second,
encapsulating what was researched and why it had to be
researched, how it was researched, what was found, limita-
tions, and the way forward or recommendations; that is, it
provides a snapshot of the research that has been conducted.
Sections of the research proposal that should appear in the
dissertation or thesis are the "research background," "research
aim and objectives," "research methodology," and "research
significance/importance," of course, with appropriate amend-
ments where necessary because the main literature review
would have been carried out and the whole research con-
ducted. The contents of the research methodology section in
this chapter are supposed to be very laconic as there will be a
chapter devoted to it in the dissertation or thesis.
Conclusion
This article has considered the essential elements of a good
proposal for both undergraduate and postgraduate students in
the social sciences and it is hoped that the students would
find it intellectually stimulating and insightful.
Although a theoretical framework, which is about the rel-
evant theory or theories that underpin a particular study, is an
imperative at a more advanced level such as MPhil or PhD, it
has not been considered above. This is because settling on a
relevant underpinning theory or theories is difficult, takes
time, and will not normally crystallize at the research pro-
posal writing stage until the main literature has been criti-
cally reviewed following the commencement of the research.
Thus, what is required at the mini literature review stage is
for the prospective researcher to bear in mind that a theoreti-
cal framework has to be ultimately developed if it is an
MPhil or doctoral research.
