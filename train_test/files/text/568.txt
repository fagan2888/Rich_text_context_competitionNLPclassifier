SOCIAL gerontologists often emphasize the importance
of older adults' embeddedness in dense, kin-centered
social networks. Such networks--in which individuals
know and interact with each other frequently--make it eas-
ier to pool resources and coordinate caregiving duties when
necessary (Ashida & Heaney, 2008; Haines, Hurlbert, &
Beggs, 1996; Kelley-Moore, Schumacher, Kahana, & Kahana,
2006). Those who have network members who know each
other have more access to social support, companionship,
and emotional aid (Haines & Hurlbert, 1992). And embed-
dedness in a dense network yields "social capital" which
increases network members' capacities to monitor and
share information about a person (Coleman, 1988).
A key motivation behind this paper is the idea that these
aspects of dense social networks may not always benefit or
appeal to older adults. Although dense networks are often
beneficial, they can present obstacles to privacy and auton-
omy. They facilitate higher levels of monitoring by one's
network members, more stringent enforcement of norms,
and greater pressure toward group conformity (Coleman,
1988; Marsden, 1987). That is, dense networks can be op-
pressive for the same reasons that they are effective at deliv-
ering support (Fischer, 1982). This side of social capital
may be more evident to older adults, whose networks tend
to be relatively dense (Adams, 1987; Cornwell, Laumann,
& Schumm, 2008; Fiori, Antonucci, & Cortina, 2006; Fiori,
Smith, & Antonucci, 2007).
As such, it might be important for older adults to main-
tain some bridging potential in their networks--that is, ties
to people who are otherwise poorly connected to each other.
For example, if Brenda talks to both Anne and Carroll fre-
quently, but Anne does not know Carroll, then Brenda is a
bridge between them. Chances are thatAnne and Carroll are
in separate networks that do not overlap much. This gives
rise to a different class of network structural benefits. For
one, it gives Brenda access to more diverse pools of resources
that may be suited to different purposes and activated under
different circumstances (Granovetter, 1973; Lin, 2001;
Wellman & Wortley, 1990). Furthermore, Anne and Carroll
may constitute alternatives to each other, which bolsters
Brenda's exchange power and insulates her from depen-
dence on either one of the pair (Emerson, 1962). In some
circumstances, serving as a bridge between others can also
yield brokerage potential or the ability to transfer resources
between two parties (Burt, 1992; Gould & Fernandez,
1989).
This is an important issue in later life, as many older
adults place a high value on independence--especially
when faced with the prospect of being dependent on others
for support (Cohler, 1983; Silverstein, Chen, & Heller,
1996). Evidence that older adults value independence is
available in research which demonstrates that being depen-
dent on or receiving excessive support often leads to emo-
tional distress, feelings of vulnerability, decreased self

Potential Among Older Women and Men

Objectives. Most studies of older adults' social networks focus on their access to dense networks that yield access to
social support. This paper documents gender differences in the extent to which older adults maintain a related, but dis-
tinct, form of social capital--bridging potential, which involves serving as a tie between two unconnected parties and thus
boosts independence and control of everyday social life.
Methods. I use egocentric social network data from a national sample of 3,005 older adults--collected in 2005­2006
by the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project--to compare older men's and women's network bridging potential
using multivariate regression analysis.
Results. Older women are more likely than older men to have bridging potential in their networks--between both kin
and non-kin contacts. These gender differences increase with age. Older women are also more likely to have network
members who are not connected to or monopolized by their spouse or partner. Some, but not all, of these gender differ-
ences are due to the fact that older women have larger social networks and maintain more ties to people outside of the
household.
Discussion. These findings raise important questions about the relational advantages older women have over older
men, including greater autonomy, and contradict stereotypes about women having more closely knit, kin-centered net-
works than men.

esteem, and a feeling of being coerced (Coyne, Wortman, &
Lehman, 1988; Lee, Netzer, & Coward, 1995; Martire,
Stephens, Druley, & Wojno, 2002; Vinokur & Vinokur,
1990). This represents a key tension in many older adults'
social lives: Older adults cherish and benefit from their con-
nections to tight-knit groups (e.g., their families), but they
also value autonomy. The work that has been done on this
issue finds that network density increases (and bridging
potential decreases) with age and that this is partly due to
later life-course experiences (Adams, 1987; Cornwell,
2009; Cornwell et al., 2008). However, people can have
bridging potential and still be embedded in a dense network
(Burt, 2005). Unfortunately, we know relatively little about
the factors that affect older adults' bridging opportunities.
Gendered Social Resources
The concern over bridging potential in social networks
maps onto larger concerns regarding gendered access to
independence and power. Some scholars point to gender
differences in network composition to explain men's more
rapid advancement in the workplace, labor market out-
comes, and entrepreneurial success (e.g., Renzulli,Aldrich, &
Moody, 2000; van Emmerik, 2006). More pertinent to older
adults, bridging in social networks also has implications for
gendered independence. A classic hypothesis holds that
tight-knit, kin-centered networks serve to maintain more
rigid, gender-segregated conjugal roles in which men are
dominant within the household (Bott, 1957). This is partly
because dense networks facilitate monitoring and thereby
help to enforce strict adherence to local social norms (see
also Burt, 1992; Hill, 1988).
The dominant perception is that women have less bridg-
ing potential in their networks than men.Although women's
networks are usually larger than men's, some work shows
that women maintain more strong, kin-based connections
that are less conducive to bridging than men's weaker
instrumental ties (see McLaughlin, Vagenas, Pachana,
Begum, & Dobson, 2010; McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &
Brashears, 2006; Moore, 1990; Ridgeway & Smith-Lovin,
1999; van Emmerik, 2006). But it is unclear whether the
gender differences in network structure that are evident
among young and middle-aged adults persist in later life.
Research does find that older women have larger networks
than older men--which would increase women's bridging
potential--but the evidence regarding gender differences
in network composition is mixed (Ajrouch, Blandon, &
Antonucci, 2005; Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987; McLaughlin
et al., 2010; Rasulo, Christensen, & Tomassini, 2005; Shye,
Mullooly, Freeborn, & Pope, 1995).
Beyond this, men and women have different life-course
experiences, which could have major implications for gen-
der differences in bridging potential in later life. For one,
older men are more likely to experience retirement, so they
are more likely to experience a sudden drop in their access
to weak and non-kin ties (e.g., Mor-Barak, Scharlach, Birba,
& Sokolov, 1992). Beyond this, bridging is dependent on
functional and cognitive health and is often compromised
when one's network members increase communication and
coordination with each other to provide social support for
health problems (Cornwell, 2009; McLaughlin et al., 2010).
Close friends and family members in particular often
"tighten" an infirm person's network by rallying around and
coordinating caregiving duties (Stoller & Pugliesi, 1991).
And because older men are more likely to (be able to) rely
on their partners for caregiver support than are older women
(Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987; Schwarzer & Gutiérrez-
Doña, 2005), older men may face more constraints on
bridging potential than older women.
Finally, socioemotional selectivity theory holds that
people become increasingly oriented to strong, emotionally
rewarding relationships as they age (Charles & Carstensen,
2010), which leads to the loss of weaker (especially non-
kin) contacts. This increased selectivity appears to be more
pronounced among men than women (Shaw, Krause, Liang, &
Bennett, 2007). Gendered life-course perspectives explain
that men adopt a more emotional approach to relationships
as they age, focusing less on instrumental ties that facilitate
individual accomplishments and more on ties that provide
emotional fulfillment (Adams & Ueno, 2006). The realities
and challenges of later life--including retirement and health
decline--make traditionally masculine priorities on power
and autonomy less appealing and more difficult to sustain.
Furthermore, old age elicits more nurturance from men,
which yields closer relationships with family (Mann, 2007;
Ribeiro, Paúl, & Nogueira, 2007). These ideas yield two
related hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1a Older women have more potential to bridge
between contacts--including non-kin--within their social
networks than older men.
Hypothesis 1b Gender differences in bridging potential
increase with age.
Independence from Intimate Partners
A key condition on many individuals' abilities to exercise
influence and maintain independence in their everyday lives
is their involvement in an intimate relationship. Partners in
long-term intimate relationships usually share joint con-
tacts, which can help them forge stronger, more committed
partnerships (e.g., see Kalmijn & Bernasco, 2001; Stein,
Bush, Ross, & Ward, 1992). Some scholars have shown that
because of their extensive access to each other's network
contacts, partners inadvertently constrain each other's
bridging potential (Bott, 1957; Burt, 1992). And as partners
share in more of each other's social experiences, they
become more integrated in each other's networks as time
goes on (Kalmijn, 2003; Milardo, 1982). Some of this
increasing overlap is attributable to later life experiences
like retirement and health problems that require partners
to play a greater role in each other's lives. A recent study
CORNWELL
784
(Cornwell & Laumann, 2011) suggested that this can be so
bothersome to some older men that it reduces their satisfac-
tion with their partners and can lead to sexual problems in
their relationships. Unfortunately, little is known about the
extent to which older adults' partners "constrain" their
bridging potential or whether such constraint is experienced
differently by men and women. But the existing work on
joint partner networks suggests the following:
Hypothesis 2 Having a spouse or partner reduces both
men's and women's bridging potential in later life.
Separation, divorce, and widowhood imply the loss of the
one social contact who is the most highly embedded within
one's network and poses the greatest (inadvertent) con-
straint on bridging potential (Burt, 1992; Kalmijn, 2003). It
is important to acknowledge that the loss of one's spouse
increases loneliness and sense of isolation in older adults
(e.g., Paúl & Ribeiro, 2009), but it is also crucial to recog-
nize that such losses are an important part of the process
through which many older adults' networks are trans-
formed. Because women are more likely than men to
become widowed (Waite & Das, 2010), this will increase
women's bridging potential relative to men, not only
because they are automatically left with fewer strong ties
in their networks but also because widowhood tends to
increase community involvement and thus increases access to
weak ties (see Cornwell et al., 2008; Donnelly & Hinterlong,
2010; Li, 2007; Utz, Carr, Nesse, & Wortman, 2002). This
could also exacerbate gender differences in bridging poten-
tial in later life.
In addition, there are several reasons to expect that older
women are more likely than older men to maintain connec-
tions to people to whom their spouses are not well con-
nected. Social network research shows that, in general,
women are more likely than men to have such people in
their networks (Kalmijn, 2003). Kearns & Leonard (2004)
offer one explanation for this, arguing that women's expec-
tations of being embedded in their spouses' networks increase
over time, whereas men are less likely to seek involvement
in their spouses' external network ties. This effectively
preserves women's independent network contacts. Fur-
thermore, this gender difference in partner-independent ties
may increase with age. As discussed earlier, older men's
weaker contacts are more likely than older women's to be
lost to retirement or abandoned due to increasing prefer-
ences for emotionally fulfilling relationships (Shaw et al.,
2007). For these reasons, I expect that:
Hypothesis 3 Older women are more likely to maintain ties
that are independent of their spouse/partner than older men.
To recap, positions within social networks that yield
bridging potential can provide older adults with opportuni-
ties to exercise informal forms of power and independence.
But the experiences of later life may reduce some individ-
uals' bridging potential. Older men are especially likely
to experience life-course transitions that reduce bridging
potential, especially retirement, health problems, and
heightened socioemotional selectivity. Given the potential
relevance of this issue to older adults, I examine the struc-
ture of older adults' social networks using recent nationally
representative data.
Data and Methods
I conduct my analysis using network data collected by
the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP)
in 2005­2006. This study includes a nationally representa-
tive sample of 3,005 community-dwelling adults between
the ages of 57­85. Interviews were conducted in respon-
dents' homes by the National Opinion Research Center.
NSHAP used a multistage area probability design that overs-
ampled by race and ethnicity, age, and gender. The final
response rate is 75.5%.
Social Network Data
NSHAP collected information about older adults' confi-
dant networks. To develop the network data, NSHAP inter-
viewers began by asking respondents the following:
From time to time, most people discuss things that are
important to them with others. For example, these may
include good or bad things that happen to you, problems
you are having, or important concerns you may have. Looking
back over the last 12 months, who are the people with whom
you most often discussed things that were important to you?
Respondents could name up to five people, who were
recorded in Roster A. (In network research, the respondent
is often referred to as "ego," so self-reported network data
such as this is often referred to as "egocentric" network
data.) Respondents were asked to describe the nature of
their relationship to each network member (e.g., friend). If,
after these five network members (referred to as "alters")
were enumerated respondents had not yet named a partner,
they were asked if they had one. If so, the partner was
recorded in a Roster B. (I include a control in all models for
whether the respondent failed to list their partner in the
initial confidant roster.) Respondents were also asked if
there was any other person to whom they are especially
close. If so, this person was added in Roster C. Respondents
reported both how often they interact with each of their
network members and how often each network member
(including the spouse/partner) interacts with each of the
other network members. This information is collected from
all respondents, regardless of the respondent's age or other
characteristics.
Network Bridging Potential
I use the data provided by respondents regarding their
ties to network members as well as their reports of how
these network members are connected to each other to mea-
sure respondents' bridging potential within their networks.
GENDER AND NETWORK BRIDGING POTENTIAL 785
Bridging potential refers to the extent to which an individual
is tied to people who are not directly (or who are only
poorly) connected to each other (Burt, 1992). The "important
things" question above elicits names of strong, frequently
accessed, long-term contacts (Marin, 2004; Marsden,
1987)--ties through which normative pressures and social
influence are likely to operate and which are thought to be
particularly important to older adults. Therefore, overall
bridging potential may be underestimated by these data.
There is no universally accepted measure of bridging
potential. In his foundational work, Burt (1992) proposed a
technical measure of bridging that he called "effective size,"
which is the number of social contacts a person has, adjusted
downward to the extent that those network members are also
tied to each other. Borgatti (1997) showed that this measure is
equivalent to network density, scaled by a factor of k - 1,
where k is the number of alters named by the respondent. I am
mainly interested in individuals' capacities to connect people.
Therefore, I simplify matters by measuring bridging potential
as the number of pairs of alters in a respondent's network
who are not directly connected to each other. My first mea-
sure of bridging therefore captures a respondent's overall op-
portunity to serve as an intermediary between unconnected
parties. This measure is distinct from Burt's (1992) measure
of effective size because it does not take into account the
extent to which the respondent is the only network member
who has access to unconnected pairs of alters within the
network. However, it does correlate with Burt's measure at
r = .87, which yields similar results when used as the depen-
dent variable in the multivariate regression analysis (see
Table A2). Hypothesis 1a suggests that older women have
more overall bridging potential than older men and asserts
that this holds for non-kin ties as well. Therefore, I also
calculate a parallel count of the number of unconnected
alter-pairs that involve at least one non-kin contact.
Partner-related bridging.--I employ two additional mea-
sures that are intended to capture respondents' autonomy
from the spouse or partner. One can maintain independence
from one's partner by having contacts who are not connect-
ed to that partner. One dichotomous measure of this is
whether a respondent has at least one confidant with whom
one's partner has little contact (only once or twice a year, or
less often), which I refer to as a partner-independent tie.
Perhaps the greatest threats to autonomy are instances in
which one's partner has greater contact with one's confi-
dants than oneself has. A final measure of bridging poten-
tial, then, is a dichotomous indicator of whether the
respondent has more contact with all of his or her other
confidants than his or her partner does--that is, whether
the respondent's network is free of partner betweenness
(Cornwell & Laumann, 2011). This allows respondents to
retain control over resources to which their partners do not
have as much access. Although these last two indicators of
bridging potential are significantly associated with each
other (c2 = 28.51, P < .001), they are not highly correlated
(r = .12), suggesting that they tap different but related
dimensions of bridging. These and other key variables in
the analysis are described in Table A1.
To clarify the distinction between overall and partner-
related bridging potential, Figure 1 illustrates three hypo-
thetical networks as derived from an individual's ("ego's")
reports of whom she/he is connected to and how those peo-
ple ("alters") are connected to each other. Each network
represents a case where ego has a spouse and four other
network members. In the left panel, all of ego's network
members are connected to each other. This network does
not afford ego any bridging potential. There are 10 possible
connections among the alters, and they are all realized (i.e.,
0 out of 10 alter-pairs are unconnected). Ego's spouse is
connected to each of the four other alters as well, so ego has
no partner-related bridging potential. In the center network
diagram, ego has considerable overall bridging potential, as
6 of the 10 possible alter-pairs are unconnected. On the
other hand, ego's spouse is equally connected to the other
four alters, so ego has no partner-related bridging potential
in that case. In the right-most diagram, ego's bridging
potential is maximized. None of ego's network members
are connected to each other, including ego's spouse, thus
yielding overall and partner-related bridging potential.
Analysis
I begin by examining bivariate differences in bridging by
gender. I then use multivariate regression analysis to predict
each of the bridging measures using a variety of covariates.
The first set of models for each outcome includes gender as
well as race and education as sociodemographic controls.
I am mainly interested in factors that help explain any gender
differences in bridging potential. One possibility is that gen-
der differences emerge as a result of men's and women's dif-
ferent life-course experiences. The second model for each
outcome thus includes: (a) whether the respondent is sepa-
rated/divorced with no current partner, whether she/he is wid-
owed with no partner, and whether she/he has never been
married--with "has a current spouse/partner" as the reference
category. (When predicting the measures of partner-specific
bridging potential, I instead use a single indicator of whether
the respondent is married to the partner.); (b) employment

cations for ego's overall and partner-related bridging potential.

status (i.e., retired); and (c) functional health and cognitive
function. Functional health is measured using an index of
nine questions about respondents' difficulty with activities
of daily living, such as: "How much difficulty do you have
bathing or showering?" I reverse-code and standardize
these responses, then average them together to create a
functional health index (a = .86). Positive values indicate
better function. Cognitive function is measured using the
Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, which in-
cludes ten questions like "What day of the week is it?" It is
scored as the number of items answered correctly (Pfeiffer,
1975).
The third model for each outcome rotates out the life-
course measures and enters measures of network structure.
Factors that may affect bridging potential include: (a) close-
ness to network members because strong ties with alters
increase the likelihood that alters will be acquainted
(Granovetter, 1973); (b) proportion of alters who are kin; (c)
proportion of alters who live in R's household; and (d) net-
work size, which is included as a series of dummy variables
that represent different-sized networks (to allow for nonlin-
ear associations between network size and bridging, which
are evident in the data). This step is useful in determining
whether any gender differences in bridging result from the
types of networks men and women have (Moore, 1990).
A final model for each outcome includes both the life-
course and network structure variables together.
The two measures of partner-related bridging potential
are dichotomous indicators, so logistic regression is appro-
priate in those cases (Cox & Snell, 1989). The measure of
overall bridging potential--the count of the number of pairs
of unconnected alter-pairs--and the measure of bridging
involving non-kin contacts are predicted using negative
binomial regression. Negative binomial models are like
Poisson models in that they predict counts, but negative
binomial models also include a parameter, s2, that accounts
for overdispersion (high variation) in the dependent variable
(McCullagh & Nelder, 1989). I also take into account the fact
that some respondents have more bridging potential merely
by virtue of the fact that they have larger networks. In net-
works like those collected by NSHAP, there are ( 1)
2
k k -
possible pairs of alters, where k is the number of network
members. When predicting the counts of unconnected alter-
pairs, I include a count of the total number of possible
unconnected alter-pairs as an "exposure" variable. This is
an additional parameter by which the dependent variable is
divided, thus expressing it not as a count but as a rate or
proportion. This means that the negative binomial model
expresses the coefficient for a given predictor in terms of its
association, not with the number but with the prevalence of
unconnected pairs of alters within one's network.
All models include person-level weights to account for
differential probabilities of selection, as well as poststratifi-
cation adjustments for nonresponse by age and urbanicity.
Analyses are conducted using Stata's survey ("svy") com-
mands that, in addition to weighting, incorporate the clus-
ters and strata of NSHAP's sample design and employ
Taylor linearized variance estimation.
Selection Issues
The regression analyses pertain only to respondents who
have at least two network members. Analysis of the partner-
related bridging measures is further restricted to those who
have a spouse/partner, yielding a sample of 1,889 for these
analyses. To adjust for selection that could result from these
restrictions, I first create a set of dichotomous measures that
indicate whether a given respondent is present in a given
model (e.g., the model predicting the presence of a partner-
independent tie). Next, I predict this indicator using a logis-
tic regression model that includes gender, age, race,
education, marital status (except for models pertaining only
to those with a partner), retirement, whether the respondent
has offspring, household size, and health as predictors.
I then take the inverse of the predicted probability that is
derived from this model (i.e., the probability that the
respondent did not make it into the presented models), mul-
tiply it by the supplied NSHAP survey weight for that
respondent, and use the product as the person-weight in the
subsequent models predicting that particular bridging mea-
sure (see Cornwell & Laumann, 2011; Morgan & Todd,
2008). This procedure effectively gives greater weight to
cases that were less likely to be included in the models, thus
attenuating any potential selection effects that were intro-
duced as a result of missing data or other sample restrictions.
Results
I begin by analyzing older adults' overall bridging poten-
tial. The first measure of bridging potential is the total num-
ber of pairs of network members who are not connected to
each other. On average, respondents report that 23.1% of
their network members are not connected to each other,
yielding an average of 2.35 unconnected pairs of network
members per respondent.
Bivariate associations between gender and measures of
bridging potential (Table 1) provide preliminary evidence
that older men's and women's networks are structurally dif-
ferent in ways that yield greater bridging potential for
women. For one, women's networks are larger than men's.
Older women's networks are no more kin-centered than
older men's networks are. Women also have significantly
fewer coresident network members. These particular trends
are favorable to women's bridging prospects. Indeed, the
number of unconnected pairs of network members is greater
in women's networks (2.70 unconnected pairs) than in
men's (1.96 unconnected pairs; F = 44.15, p < .001).
Table 2 presents results from negative binomial regres-
sion analyses predicting overall bridging potential. Based
on the initial model in Table 2, older women have about
GENDER AND NETWORK BRIDGING POTENTIAL 787
51.5% more unconnected pairs of network members than
men, providing initial support for hypothesis 1a. This esti-
mate is marginally smaller in the second model (F = 3.60,
p < .07), providing some evidence that a portion of older
women's bridging potential derives from their life-course
experiences. For example, the older women in this sample
are much less likely to be married than the older men (56.0%
vs. 78.3%, respectively), lifting what is usually a
major constraint on married individuals' bridging potential.
A greater reduction in the gender coefficient (F = 31.08,
p < .001) occurs when network structural measures are con-
sidered (model 3). People who are closer to their network
members, whose networks are comprised of more kin
and/or coresidents, and whose networks are larger tend to
have more bridging potential. The reduction in the gender
coefficient between models 1 and 3 is most closely tied to
the influence of network size and the presence of coresident
alters. If I only include network size in model 3, the inci-
dence rate ratio associated with gender is cut in half, from
1.44 to 1.22 (F = 39.59, p < .001). This is because women
have larger networks than men, which increases bridging
potential automatically. Likewise, if I only include the pres-
ence of coresident network members in model 3, the inci-
dence rate ratio associated with gender is cut from 1.44 to
1.17 (F = 74.50, p < .001). This is because women draw
fewer of their network members from the household, which
inevitably means that they have fewer network members
who see each other every day. In the end, when all variables
are considered together (model 4), we find that older women
have 15.9% more bridging opportunities than older men.

Not only do older women have more bridging potential
but also that potential extends beyond their family ties. As
shown in Figure 2, although 50.1% of older women serve as
a bridge between kin and non-kin ties, only 37.6% of men
do (F = 41.39, p < .001). Women are also 30% more likely
than older men to serve as a link between two non-kin con-
fidants (29.5% vs. 22.7%; F = 13.59, p < .001). The first
model of Table 3 shows that older women have 53.8% more
opportunities than older men to serve as a bridge between
pairs of alters in which at least one is a non-kin contact
(providing further support for hypothesis 1a). Once all the
life-course and network structural determinants of bridging
are included (model 4), we see that older women have
18.6% more opportunities than men to serve as a bridge that
involves non-kin contacts. As above, when I include net-
work size and the prevalence of coresident network mem-
bers separately in model 3, I find that older women's
bridging potential advantage derives especially from their
larger networks (F = 40.52, p < .001) and from their greater
propensity to be connected to non-coresidents (F = 85.06,
p < .001).
It is worth noting before I move onto tests of the other
hypotheses that older women's greater bridging potential
does not come to them at the cost of their having less access
to other forms of social capital. For example, older women
are just as likely as older men to have network members

who have strong ties to each other. About 77.0% of older
men and 79.0% of older women have at least one pair of
network members who interact with each other on at least a
weekly basis (F = 1.77, p = .19). Broken down by dyad
type, older women are actually more likely than older men
to have at least two family members in their networks who
talk to each other at least once a week (66.8% vs. 61.2%,
respectively; F = 6.57, p = .014). In this sense, older women
have the best of both worlds--bridging potential as well as
access to robust social capital.
Gender Interaction
I also explore whether age conditions the association
between gender and bridging potential. Hypothesis 1b
states that gender differences in bridging potential increase
with age. The final model of Table 2 includes an interaction
between age and gender. The interaction is significant and
positive. Interactions can be difficult to interpret, so I dis-
play the nature of this conditional relationship in Figure 3.
As shown in the figure, the gender difference in overall
bridging potential is greatest among the oldest adults in the
sample, with a slight upward trend for women by age and a
slight downward trend for men. For example, the predicted
number of bridging ties (disconnected pairs of alters) for a
60-year-old woman is 1.12, compared to 1.05 for a 60-year-old
man. The predicted number of bridging ties for a 80-year-
old woman is 1.29, compared to .98 among a 80-year-old
man. There is also an interaction between gender and age in
the analysis of non-kin bridging potential (see the final
model of Table 3), suggesting that gender differences in the
potential to serve as a bridge between a non-kin contact and
any other type of contact are greater in later life. These
results support hypothesis 1b.
Bridging and Intimate Partners
I now consider the difference in bridging potential be-
tween those who have a spouse/partner and those who
do not. First, the data show that an average of 20.6% of
partnered respondents' alter-pairs are unconnected, com-
pared to 30.5% of non-partnered respondents' alter-pairs
(F = 35.01, p < .001). In addition, partners are more likely
than non-partners to be connected to the rest of one's network.
For example, the spouses/partners of partnered respondents
know an average of 92.5% of the other network members
in those respondents' networks. The non-partner contacts of
respondents who have a spouse/partner know an average of
76.8% of those respondents' other network members (unad-
justed paired-samples t test: t = 29.88, p < .001). Furthermore,
among partnered older adults, only 9.9% have a network
member who is not connected to anyone in the confidant net-
work aside from the respondent, compared with 30.5% among
non-partnered older adults (F = 79.10, p < .001). This pro-
vides preliminary evidence that the presence of a partner
constrains bridging potential.
Model 2 in Table 2 confirms that older adults who have a
spouse or partner have less bridging potential than others
(hypothesis 2). In particular, those who are separated/
divorced or who never married and do not have a current
partner have significantly more bridging potential in their
networks than those who are married or have a coresident
partner. Model 2 in Table 3 shows that the same is true with
respect to bridging that involves non-kin contacts (also see
Table A2). But the association between partner status and
bridging potential is tied up with other aspects of network
structure. The fourth model in Table 2, for example, shows
that having a spouse or partner is not significantly associ-
ated with bridging potential once network structure is taken
into account. This suggests that individuals who are part-
nered have less bridging potential in part because they have
different kinds of networks (e.g., more kin-centered) than
individuals who are not partnered.
Partner-Independent Ties
Finally, I turn to the analysis of partner-related bridging
potential. Table 4 presents results from multivariate logistic
regression analyses predicting whether partnered respon-
dents have at least one network member to whom the part-
ner is not connected.About 42% of these respondents report
having at least one such confidant. From model 1, older
women are 21.7% more likely than older men to maintain
such a contact, but this is not statistically significant. How-
ever, it is necessary to control for health and life-course
experiences because they are related to both gender and
network structure. When I do this, the gender association
becomes significant (model 2), revealing that women are
36.0% more likely than men to have an external network
member who is not in contact with the partner. This result
holds when network structure is taken into account (model 4).
The increase in the gender estimate when life-course factors
are taken into account is significant (F = 8.43, p < .01). It
turns out that health is the main factor at work here. Older
women have more functional health difficulties, which can

make maintaining independent contacts (e.g., in voluntary
associations) more difficult. When functional health is
included in model 2 alone, the odds ratio associated with
gender increases from 1.22 to 1.32 (F = 9.92, p < .01).
The final measure of bridging indicates whether the
respondent has more contact with each of his or her network
members than his or her partner has. Most people (75.9%)
are entirely free of such "partner betweenness" in their con-
fidant relations. Multivariate analyses (Table 5) suggest that
older women are more than twice as likely as older men to
have this form of independence. This difference increases
with the inclusion of life-course and network structural
measures. Model 3 demonstrates the particular importance
of network size. The more confidants one has, the greater
the likelihood one's partner can monopolize contact with at
least one of them. In fact, the advantage older women pos-
sess with respect to this partner-related form of bridging
potential gets a significant boost--from an odds ratio of
2.09­2.66--when network size alone is stepped into model 3
(F = 27.14, p < .001). Taking all the life-course and network

GENDER AND NETWORK BRIDGING POTENTIAL 791
factors into account (model 4), there is still a large gender
difference in older adults' access to partner-independent
ties. Older women are 2.8 times as likely as older men to
monopolize access to all their confidant relations. In combi-
nation with the results from Table 4, these analyses provide
strong support for hypothesis 3 (that older women are more
likely to maintain ties that are independent of their spouse/
partner than older men).
Note that gender differences in access to partner-
independent network members are not conditional on age in
the same way that overall bridging potential is. The interac-
tion between gender and age is not significant, in the final
models in Tables 4 and 5. This tempers support for hypoth-
esis 1b by showing that it is restricted to overall bridging
potential.
Discussion
This study was motivated by the idea that bridging posi-
tions in social networks provide older adults with opportu-
nities to exercise autonomy and give them more control
over their everyday social lives. Contrary to conventional
wisdom, which suggests that women's networks are more
kin-centered and communal than men's (see Ridgeway &
Smith-Lovin, 1999), this study finds that older women have
significantly more bridging potential in their networks. This
holds for different types of ties, including those involving
non-kin contacts.
This gender difference is partly, but not entirely, attribut-
able to the fact that older women have larger networks and
more ties to non-coresident confidants. And although com-
mon later life experiences like retirement, widowhood, and
health problems are generally negatively related to bridging
potential, there is only modest evidence that older women's
bridging advantage relative to men stems from gender dif-
ferences in the prevalence of these experiences. Indeed,
older men are more likely to be partnered (Waite & Das,
2010), and because one's intimate partner is usually closely
tied to one's other confidants (Kalmijn, 2003), this reduces
older men's bridging potential. But these life-course factors
still do not fully explain gender differences in bridging po-
tential, nor do they explain why women's bridging advantage
relative to men increases with age.
Several unmeasured factors may help to explain these
differences. Perhaps most relevant to older adults, socio-
emotional selectivity theory argues that people become in-
creasingly oriented to strong, emotionally rewarding
relationships as they age (Charles & Carstensen, 2010). If
preferences for more emotionally close ties are acted upon,
this could lead to a disproportionate loss or abandonment of
weak ties (see Ikkink & van Tilburg, 1999; Shaw et al.,
2007; van Tilburg, 1998), which would in turn reduce bridg-
ing potential (Granovetter, 1973). And researchers have
found that this increased selectivity is more pronounced
among men (Adams & Ueno, 2006; Shaw et al., 2007). This
change could reflect shifts in perceptions of masculinity
that often occur in later life, which compel men to adopt
more nurturing roles and to derive influence from the oppor-
tunity to convey wisdom and experience (Mann, 2007).
More research is needed to determine whether this psycho-
logical shift contributes to men's decreasing bridging
advantage relative to women in later life.
Whatever its cause, the gender difference in bridging
potential is important because it reveals that women have a
structural advantage that is known to have instrumental
value in some contexts (e.g., Burt, 1992; Gould & Fernandez,
1989). However, more work is needed to understand the
consequences of bridging in personal networks for older
adults. A motivating assumption of this paper is that bridg-
ing increases older adults' capacities to be independent and
affords them some relational power and control in their
everyday lives (e.g., Burt, 2005). If this is true, bridging
may have a positive effect on important psychological out-
comes like sense of control and self-esteem. It may also be
protective against feelings of helplessness and dependency.
Bridging potential that stems from having ties to people
who are not well connected to one's spouse or partner, spe-
cifically, may have unique consequences for older adults'
intimate partner relationships and for their interactions
within the household. Recent work suggests that, for older
men, having network contacts who are too closely linked to
one's spouse can reduce partner satisfaction and lead to
strained sexual relations (Cornwell & Laumann, 2011).
Other work suggested that, for women, maintaining exter-
nal social contacts helps them to avoid stringent gender role
demands within the household (Burt, 1992). Though lim-
ited, this work suggests a provocative direction for under-
standing gender relations among older adults that shifts the
focus to network structural factors. Along these lines, the
fact that partners' social networks overlap more as time
goes on (Kalmijn, 2003) deserves attention as a possible
explanation for shifts in gender roles that occur in later life
(e.g., Ribeiro, Paúl, & Nogueira, 2007).
It is important to note that while bridging likely contrib-
utes to older adults' independence, sense of control, and
gender identity in later life, it is not a viable substitute for
strong ties in dense networks. A key issue is the extent to
which older adults can maintain bridging potential while
also maintaining connections that yield dependable social
support. It is possible that benefits of bridging are contin-
gent on individuals' also maintaining other forms of social
capital that are associated with being embedded in dense
networks (Coleman, 1988). Along these lines, it is interest-
ing that women are more likely than men to maintain both
bridging potential and access to the strong types of ties that
yield social support. Likewise, although partner-related
bridging can be beneficial in some ways, it is important to
bear in mind the benefits to partners of cultivating jointly
shared contacts alongside any separate network ties. Highly
overlapping social networks are advantageous to couples in
CORNWELL
792
later life, in part because they increase access to mutual
contacts who are invested in both partners, which thereby
makes it easier to coordinate social support for one partner
when it is needed (Ashida & Heaney, 2008).
Collaboration between gender scholars, network re-
searchers, and social gerontologists will help shed light on
the relational causes and consequences of these forms of
bridging potential in later life. Of course, future work should
avoid some of the limitations of this study. Longitudinal
data may be especially useful by making it possible to take
into account the reciprocal effects of network structure on
health factors that may affect bridging potential (Cornwell,
2009). This will also make it possible to identify some of the
consequences of network bridging potential for older adults
(e.g., sense of control), which are assumed but not demon-
strated directly in this paper. Finally, this study cannot say
anything about the structures of younger or middle-aged
men's and women's social networks or how they are shaped
by earlier life-course experiences (e.g., widowhood in early
adulthood). Much of the research that has addressed gender
differences in network structure (e.g., Moore, 1990) and the
tendency for intimate partners' social networks to converge
over time (e.g., Kalmijn, 2003) has focused on the general
population. It is unclear to what extent the findings reported
here apply to younger samples. But by exploring these is-
sues in greater depth, social gerontologists will at least be
better able to clarify the value of specific structural features
of social networks to older adults.
