Smoking, and Hypertension: A Comparison Based
on NHEFS and NHANES III

Objective. To compare the impact of arthritis, smoking, and residual hypertension on the annual rate of hospital
admissions in adults ages 45­74, because arthritis imposes a heavy health burden on individuals and higher medical costs
on the nation.
Methods. A simulation model was used to estimate annual hospital admissions attributable to each risk factor for all
adults ages 45­74, and for overweight adults in that age bracket, from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III).
Results. Arthritis accounted for 6.2% of annual hospital admissions (8.1 admissions per 1,000 NHANES III adults).
Current smoking accounted for a slightly larger share of admissions (7.0% or 9.1 admissions per 1,000 adults) and
residual hypertension accounted for a smaller share (2.3% or 3.0 admissions per 1,000 adults). Because arthritis is more
prevalent in overweight adults, it accounted for 7.4% of admissions (11.0 admissions per 1,000 annually in this group),
compared with 5.8% for smoking (8.6 admissions per 1,000).
Conclusion. Although the impact of smoking and hypertension receives more attention from the media, the impact of
arthritis on hospitalizations is substantial. This finding provides additional support for the goals of the National Arthritis
Action Plan.

INTRODUCTION
Arthritis affects 17.5% of all adults, and is the leading
cause of disability in the United States (1). Although it is
not a fatal condition, the health burden related to arthritis
is substantial. Functional and physical limitations are far
greater in persons with arthritis than in those without, and
having arthritis appears to exacerbate the clinical course of
other chronic conditions (i.e., cancer, hypertension, and
coronary heart disease) by increasing the limitation of
activities of daily living (2) and the risk of cardiovascular
events (3). The social impact of arthritis is also great;
arthritis patients are more likely to report needing assis-
tance from others, and report fewer opportunities for so-
cial interaction and sports or outdoor activities (4).
Arthritis is more common in overweight adults (5); a
recent study found that overweight adults were 4 times
more likely to have arthritis than adults of normal weight
(6). Another study estimated that adults with arthritis and
other rheumatic conditions accounted for approximately
$186.9 billion in medical care expenditures (7). Further-
more, research has shown that hospital admissions are the
largest component of rheumatoid arthritis costs, account-
ing for more than 50% of the annual cost of rheumatoid
arthritis (8,9).
We compared the impact of arthritis on the number of
hospitalizations of adults ages 45­74 with the impact at-
tributable to smoking and hypertension. A simulation
model based on the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey I (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Followup
Study (NHEFS) was used to estimate the hospital admis-
sions attributable to each risk factor in NHANES III adults
ages 45­74. Several features of the model helped ensure
that the estimates were comparable. First, the model esti-
mates hospital admissions for any cause, which reflect the
effect of each risk factor on admissions for which it is

either the principal cause, or a contributing cause. Second,
the equations that link risk factors to admissions are based
on a single, population-based nationally-representative
dataset. Third, a wide range of risk factors is included in
the model, so that the effect of each is estimated after
controlling for all others.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) are large national surveys conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics that collect informa-
tion about risk factors and health outcomes of representa-
tive samples of Americans. The NHANES are the basis for
national studies and goals, such as some of those in
Healthy People 2010, a national health report designed to
identify significant preventable threats to health and to
establish national goals to reduce these threats (10).
The estimates presented in this article are based on data
from the NHANES I and NHANES III. The NHANES I,
fielded in 1971­1975, is unique in that it had a longitudi-
nal followup, (NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study
[NHEFS]), which tracked participants' health for 2 de-
cades, allowing baseline risk factors to be linked to subse-
quent outcomes. The NHEFS was used as the basis for our
simulation model. The hospitalization submodel of the
simulation model was applied to data for adults from
NHANES III, fielded in 1988­1994, because the preva-
lence of risk factors in that survey better represents current
trends in adults (e.g., more obesity, and fewer smokers).
Hospitalization submodel. The hospitalization sub-
model consists of projection equations based on the
NHEFS that link annual hospital admissions for each per-
son to a comprehensive set of risk factors measured at
baseline. The submodel subdivides men and women ages
45­74 into 4 groups (men ages 45­64 and 65­74 and
women 45­64 and 65­74), and uses separate regressions
for each group. The NHEFS excluded persons older than
74 at baseline. For each person (i) within an age-sex group
in each year of followup (t), logged hospital admissions
during the year were related to the individual's baseline
characteristics using the following equation:
Ln admissionsit
 f (risk factors)
where risk factors equal arthritis, current smoking, former
smoking, ln systolic blood pressure, overweight, or other
risk factors discussed below. The equations are negative
binomial count regressions fitted with STATA statistical
software, version 3.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station,
TX), (regressions available on request from the author).
Count regressions are closely related to hazard models.
They model the number of events during a period of time
(in this study, a year), while hazard models focus on the
duration of time between events. Count models are partic-
ularly appropriate for data such as annual hospital admis-
sions because they are built on probability distributions
that assume that the dependent variable takes on only
integer values and that zeroes and low numbers are com-
mon (11). The negative binomial is more flexible than the
other commonly used count model, the Poisson, because it
does not require the mean and variance of the dependent
variable to be equal; it contains the Poisson as a special
case. Estimates based on the hospitalization submodel
have been published in 2 previous reports (12,13).
The submodel is fitted to data for the full 2 decades of
followup and can project admissions over this period,
adjusting for mortality. The estimates presented here do
not use the ability of the submodel to project events over
time. All estimates were made for the baseline period,
before anyone had died. Thus the estimates refer to the full
NHANES III population in the baseline years, 1988­1994,
and compare alternative scenarios for that period.
The literature on determinants of heart disease, cancer,
and stroke was reviewed to identify the risk factors used in
the regressions. The focus was on clinical risk factors,
specifically, those that would be determined during a visit
to a physician. Hospital admissions were related to all
clinical risk factors that have been shown to be statistically
significantly related to disease and/or death in multiple
studies: age, race, smoking, systolic blood pressure, over-
weight and underweight, laboratory test results (serum
albumin, serum cholesterol), exercise, alcohol consump-
tion, diet (fiber, fish/shellfish, fruits/vegetables), and 9
groups of chronic conditions (12,14,15). The effect of each
risk factor, including arthritis, smoking, and blood pres-
sure, was estimated after controlling for all other risk fac-
tors. The measurement of the 3 risk factors focused on in
the study (arthritis, current smoking, and hypertension) is
described below (12,14,15).
A dichotomous variable for arthritis was defined, based
on each participant's answer to the question in the
NHANES I medical history interview, "Has a doctor ever
told you that you have had arthritis?" Because the question
did not distinguish between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
arthritis, the answer encompassed both.
Only half of NHANES I participants were asked about
their smoking habits at baseline; however, at the first
NHEFS followup in 1982­1984, the National Center for
Health Statistics retrospectively collected this information
for the other half of the participants. Retrospective infor-
mation was used only when baseline information was
missing. Machlin et al (16) reported that, for participants
ages 45­74 with both baseline and retrospective data, and
for the 3 categories of smokers used here (current, former,
never), the 2 sources matched for 89% of subject respon-
dents and 83% of proxy respondents (proxies were used
primarily for people who had died). Smoking was repre-
sented by 2 dichotomous variables in the regressions, one
for participants who were smokers at baseline, and one for
participants who reported being former smokers. Never
smokers were the comparison group.
Participants' systolic blood pressure was measured only
once during their physical examinations. Because a single
measurement can be atypical, national guidelines recom-
mend that a diagnosis of hypertension be based on several
measurements taken at different visits (17). However, be-
cause the NHEFS is longitudinal (individuals were fol-
lowed for 2 decades after baseline and hospitalizations
were recorded), our estimating equations self-correct for
this problem. Individuals who had an unusually high sin-
gle baseline pressure measurement would naturally have
544 Harris and Russell
had the number of hospitalizations during followup that
corresponded to their true lower pressures. The equations
linking hospitalizations to baseline pressures thus correct
for regression to the mean because persons whose pres-
sures were overstated by a single reading contributed a
smaller number of hospitalizations during followup than
those with genuinely elevated pressures. Systolic blood
pressure was a continuous variable in the estimating equa-
tions. All continuous risk factors were entered in log form
because logs gave a better fit.
The equations used in this analysis, and those used in
the study by Russell et al (13), were based on the full
NHEFS followup through 1992. These equations project
the sample experience well, tracking both the higher ad-
missions of the 1970s and early 1980s, and the drop in
admissions due to managed care in the later 1980s and
early 1990s (18). Although the model's projections for
1988­1992 exceeded observed admissions, data from the
benchmark National Hospital Discharge Survey showed
that they accurately represented the longer-term trends
beyond the early 1990s, especially the return to rising
annual admission rates among people ages 65 and older
(19).
Cohort dataset. The hospitalization submodel was used
to estimate the impact of arthritis, smoking, and hyperten-
sion on the number of hospital admissions in adults ages
45­74 in the NHANES III. The cohort dataset includes all
NHANES III respondents in this age group who were ex-
amined by a physician (n  6,265). Data were used on all
sample persons because 84% of the respondents had com-
plete information available, 9% of the respondents had
missing data for only one risk factor, and only 0.21% (13
individuals) were missing data for more than 5 risk factors.
Missing values were replaced with the mean of the risk
factor for the age-sex group.
Arthritis, smoking habit, and systolic blood pressure
were determined in the same manner in both the NHANES
I and NHANES III (except that all NHANES III adults were
asked about smoking at baseline). Because the NHANES I
measured systolic pressure only once (see above), the first
NHANES III measurement was used in the analysis to
maintain consistency with the projection equations.
Sample weights. NHANES III was a stratified cluster
sample. Our estimates for each sample person were
weighted to reflect his/her share of the US population of
noninstitutionalized adults in 1988­1994. Of several sta-
tistical weights available for NHANES III, we used the
weight associated with medical examinations.
Estimates. Baseline estimates of annual hospital admis-
sion rates were calculated by entering observed baseline
values of the risk factors for the 6,265 NHANES III adult
respondents ages 45­74 into the model equations, and
calculating admissions for the baseline period. Population
attributable-risk estimates were then calculated for 3 sce-
narios. In each scenario, 1 risk factor was changed in the
baseline period, while all other risk factors remained at
observed baseline values. These scenarios followed the
standard definition of population attributable risk, which
measures the amount of the health problem that could
have been prevented if the risk factor had never existed
(20). The differences between the baseline estimates and
each of the attributable-risk estimates represent number of
hospital admissions attributable to arthritis, current smok-
ing, and hypertension, respectively. Simulations were run
separately for all persons ages 45­74 and overweight per-
sons ages 45­74. The scenarios are described in detail
below, and the same procedures were followed for both
groups.
Attributable risk scenarios. Arthritis eliminated. All
NHANES III adults ages 45­74 with arthritis were identi-
fied, and the dichotomous variable representing arthritis
was set equal to 0 for them (no arthritis); it was already 0
for other adults. The model was run with the new values
for arthritis while all other risk factors, including smoking
and systolic blood pressure, remained at baseline values.
Current smoking eliminated. All current smokers at
baseline were identified, and the dichotomous variable
representing current smoking was set to zero for them.
Former smokers remained former smokers and both smok-
ing variables remained at zero for true nonsmokers. The
model was run with the new values for current smoking
while all other risk factors, including arthritis and systolic
blood pressure, remained at baseline values.
Hypertension eliminated. All persons with systolic
pressures of 140 mm Hg or higher (the category that de-
fines hypertension) were identified and their pressures
were reduced to 139. Pressures of other adults remained at
their observed baseline levels. It is important to note that
by 1988­1994 when NHANES III was conducted, hyper-
tension was often treated aggressively and some NHANES
III adults had successfully reduced their systolic pressures
to below 140 mm Hg. Others, although still hypertensive,
had reduced their pressures below what they would have
been naturally. For these reasons, the estimates for hyper-
tension are best described as showing the effects of "resid-
ual" hypertension; these estimates have been published
previously (13).
RESULTS
In 1988­1994, each of the 3 risk factors (arthritis, current
smoking, and residual hypertension) was common in
NHANES III adults ages 45­74 (Table 1). Approximately
33.5% of the sample reported having arthritis, 24.0% of
the sample were current smokers, and 27.8% had residual
hypertension. A substantial percentage of the sample was
overweight (43.3%). Men were more likely to be current
smokers and women were more likely to have arthritis.
Both arthritis (41.0%) and residual hypertension (33.6%)
were more prevalent in the overweight sample.
Estimates for all persons ages 45­74. Arthritis had a
substantial effect on the number of hospital admissions:
when arthritis was eliminated at baseline, the annual hos-
pital admission rate was reduced by 6.2%, or 8.1 admis-
sions per 1,000 (Table 2). Eliminating smoking had the
Arthritis, Smoking, Hypertension, and Hospitalizations 545
largest effect on the number of hospital admissions. If all
current smokers had been nonsmokers at baseline, the
annual hospital admission rate would have been reduced
by 7.0%, or 9.1 admissions per 1,000. Residual hyperten-
sion had the smallest effect on hospital admissions; its
elimination was associated with a reduction of 2.3% or 3.0
fewer admissions per 1,000.
The role of current smoking on the rate of hospital
admissions varied by sex. The impact of eliminating cur-
rent smoking was almost 3 times greater in men (a reduc-
tion of 10.4%, or 14.2 fewer admissions per 1,000) than in
women (a reduction of 3.7%, or 4.5 fewer admissions per
1,000 annually). The effects of arthritis and residual hy-
pertension did not vary by sex.
Estimates for overweight persons ages 45­74. At base-
line and for each population attributable-risk scenario,
annual hospital admission rates for the overweight sample
exceeded those for all adults ages 45­74 (Table 3). Elimi-
nation of arthritis and smoking had comparable effects.
Eliminating arthritis in overweight adults reduced hospi-
tal admission rates at baseline by 7.4% (11.0 fewer admis-
sions per 1,000 overweight adults), while eliminating cur-
rent smoking was associated with a 5.8% reduction in
annual hospital admission rates (8.6 fewer admissions per
1,000 overweight adults). The elimination of residual hy-
pertension resulted in a reduction of only 2.7% in hospital
admissions (4.0 fewer hospital admissions per 1,000 over-
weight adults).
Figure 1 compares the reductions in hospital admissions
due to arthritis, current smoking, and residual hyperten-
sion for all adults and for overweight adults. Of the 3 risk
factors studied, arthritis was the most important contrib-
utor to annual hospital admissions for overweight adults
ages 45­74, while current smoking was the most important
contributor for all adults.
In the overweight sample as in the full sample, the
impact of eliminating current smoking in men was more
than twice the impact in women, and the impact of elim-
inating arthritis and hypertension did not vary by sex.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study help establish the fact that arthri-
tis has a substantial impact on the number of hospital
admissions. Although the estimates of hospitalizations at-
tributable to arthritis for all adults are somewhat less than
those attributable to smoking, they are substantial and
exceed estimates for residual hypertension. Both smoking

and hypertension receive more media attention as health
risks, perhaps because of their clear impact on mortality.
For all adults ages 45­74 in the NHANES III, eliminating
current smoking was associated with a 7.0% reduction in
the number of hospitalizations at baseline, while the elim-
ination of arthritis resulted in a 6.2% reduction. The effect
of arthritis on hospitalizations in overweight adults ex-
ceeded the effect of current smoking (7.4% and 5.8%,
respectively). Because arthritis is more common and more
devastating in this group, this finding suggests a need for
more targeted prevention and disease management efforts
for overweight adults with arthritis.
A recently published cost-of-illness study comparing
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and hypertension re-
ported findings similar to ours (21). Taking into consider-
ation both direct costs (physician visits, hospitalizations,
tests, drugs) and indirect costs (time, lost productivity),
this study found that the total annual cost of rheumatoid
arthritis exceeded that of hypertension by more than two-
fold. The total annual cost of osteoarthritis was also con-
siderably larger than that of hypertension (21). These find-
ings further underscore the impact of arthritis on health
care utilization and medical costs.
One study appears to conflict with our results. Ver-
brugge and Patrick, in a study that used national surveys to
examine the impact of 7 chronic conditions on health care
utilization, concluded that arthritis did not have a signif-
icant impact on hospital use (22). Although their results
showed that arthritis was the most common chronic con-
dition for adults over the age of 65, and ranked first for
limitations in adults ages 45 years and older, the authors
concluded that arthritis was not a major factor in the
number of physician visits or hospitalizations. This find-
ing is possible because in their study only principal diag-
noses for office visits and hospitalizations were consid-
ered, which would tend to underestimate the role of
arthritis (often as a secondary condition) in determining
health care utilization. Our estimates include the effect of
each risk factor as a contributing cause to hospitalizations
that may carry some other primary diagnosis.
Dunlop et al acknowledged that "Regardless of the def-
inition or the accounting method, the economic impact of
arthritis is substantial and rising" (23). In 1997, arthritis
and other rheumatic conditions were associated with
744,000 hospitalizations and 44 million ambulatory care
visits (24). There is consistent evidence that people with
arthritis experience higher medical costs than those with-
out arthritis (23,25). In another study, Dunlop et al dem-
onstrated that people with arthritis were more likely to
have a physician's visit, hospital admission, and out-of-
pocket costs exceeding $5,000 in the previous year, after
controlling for age, sex, comorbid conditions, socioeco-
nomic status, and other demographic factors (26).
There have been a number of recent policy initiatives
that address the impact of arthritis as a public health
problem. Healthy People 2010 contains 8 objectives aimed
at reducing the societal and personal impact of arthritis
(10). In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, in collaboration with the Arthritis Foundation
and the Association of State and Territorial Health Offi-
cials, created the National Arthritis Action Plan (NAAP)
(27). The NAAP is comprised of 4 goals: 1) to establish the
scientific base of knowledge regarding the prevention of
arthritis and disability; 2) to increase awareness of the
impact of arthritis and the importance of early diagnosis,
management, and prevention; 3) to implement effective
prevention programs; and 4) to achieve the arthritis-re-
lated objectives outlined in the Healthy People 2010 ini-
tiative. These goals are a promising step towards alleviat-
