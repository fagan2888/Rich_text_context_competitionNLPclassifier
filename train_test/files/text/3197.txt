Abstract:
We compared forecasts of stock market volatility based on real-time and revised
macroeconomic data. To this end, we used a new dataset on monthly real-time
macroeconomic variables for Germany. The dataset covers the period 1994-2005. We
used a statistical, a utility-based, and an options-based criterion to evaluate volatility
forecasts. Our main result is that the statistical and economic value of volatility
forecasts based on real-time data is comparable to the value of forecasts based on
revised macroeconomic data.

Non Technical Summary
Studying the question of whether macroeconomic variables that capture business cycle
fluctuations help to forecast stock market volatility is important for investors,
macroeconomists, and policy makers. Finding an answer to this question may help
investors to refine theories of derivatives pricing, to compute more exact solutions to
problems of optimal portfolio selection, and to efficiently monitor and manage financial
risks. Macroeconomists and policy makers can benefit from finding an answer to this
question because it may help them to develop a better understanding of potential
macroeconomic determinants of systematic financial-sector risk.
We studied whether it is important to account for the fact that macroeconomic data are
subject to substantial historical revisions when one studies the link between
macroeconomic variables and stock market volatility. Empirical research so far has not
shed light on this question because, to the best of our knowledge, only revised
macroeconomic data have been used to analyze macroeconomic determinants of stock
market volatility.
In order to close this gap in the literature, our research contributes to the literature on
the macroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility in three dimensions. First,
by using a new monthly real-time macroeconomic data set for Germany that covers the
period 1994-2005, we accounted for the fact that, in real time, one can only make
inferences about the links between macroeconomic variables and stock market volatility
by using the then available preliminary real-time macroeconomic data. Second, we
applied a recursive modeling approach to analyze whether macroeconomic data help to
forecast stock market volatility in real time. Third, we used three different criteria to
evaluate the accuracy of forecasts of stock market volatility based on real-time
macroeconomic data: a statistical criterion, a utility based criterion, and an option-based
criterion.
Our main results suggests that, according to our forecast-evaluation criteria, the value of
volatility forecasts based on real-time macroeconomic data is roughly comparable to the
value of volatility forecasts based on revised macroeconomic data.
Nicht technische Zusammenfassung
Die Frage, ob makroökonomische Variablen hilfreich für die Prognose der Volatilität
von Aktienmärkten sind, ist wichtig sowohl für Investoren einerseits als auch für
Makroökonomen und Wirtschaftspolitiker andererseits. Investoren können auf Basis
entsprechender Untersuchungen die Methoden der Preisfindung von Derivaten
verbessern, optimale Portfolios exakter berechnen und finanzielle Risiken genauer
einschätzen. Makroökonomen und Wirtschaftspolitiker sind aufgrund einschlägiger
Erkenntnisse besser in der Lage, die makroökonomischen Bestimmungsgründe
systematischer Risiken im Finanzsektor präziser zu analysieren.
Das vorliegende Papier analysiert, ob es bei der Untersuchung eines möglichen
Zusammenhangs zwischen makroökonomischen Variablen und der Volatilität von
Aktienmärkten wichtig ist, die Tatsache zu berücksichtigen, dass makroökonomische
Daten in erheblicher Weise nachträglich revidiert werden. Bisherige Untersuchungen
der makroökonomischen Determinanten der Volatilität von Aktienmärkten haben diesen
Aspekt unseres Wissens bisher nicht berücksichtigt, da sie ausschließlich auf Basis von
bereits revidierten Daten durchgeführt wurden.
Die Untersuchung geht in dreifacher Hinsicht über frühere Studien hinaus. Zum ersten
verwenden wir einen neuen, monatlichen Echtzeit-Datensatz, der für den Zeitraum von
1994 bis 2005 für jeden Monat den damals jeweils vorliegenden Datenstand
dokumentiert. Auf diese Weise berücksichtigen wir, dass in Echtzeit nur die
vorläufigen, nicht revidierten Daten herangezogen werden können, um den
Zusammenhang zwischen der Volatilität von Aktienmärkten und ihren
makroökonomischen Bestimmungsgründen zu untersuchen. Zum zweiten nutzen wir
einen rekursiven Ansatz, um zu prüfen, ob makroökonomische Daten zur Vorhersage
der Volatilität von Aktienmärkten geeignet sind. Zum dritten verwenden wir drei
Kriterien zur Beurteilung der Genauigkeit der Prognosen: ein statistisches, ein
nutzentheoretisches und ein optionsbasiertes Kriterium.
Unsere Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass die Genauigkeit von Volatilitäts-Prognosen auf
Basis von Echtzeitdaten in etwa jener von Vorhersagen aufgrund von revidierten Daten
entspricht.

Forecasting Stock Market Volatility with
Macroeconomic Variables in Real Time *
1. Introduction
Macroeconomic variables play a key role in asset pricing theories. For this reason,
many authors have empirically studied the link between macroeconomic variables and
stock market volatility. A common finding in these studies is that stock market volatility
tends to rise in periods of business cycle downturns (Errunza and Hogan 1998, Schwert
1989, Hamilton and Lin 1996). For investors, this finding raises the question of whether
macroeconomic variables that capture business cycle fluctuations help to forecast stock
market volatility. Finding an answer to this question may help investors to refine
theories of derivatives pricing, to compute more exact solutions to problems of optimal
portfolio selection, and to efficiently monitor and manage financial risks. Finding an
answer to this question may also be useful for macroeconomists, politicians, and central
bankers to develop a better understanding of potential macroeconomic determinants of
systematic financial-sector risk.
For an investor who seeks to forecast stock market volatility based on
macroeconomic variables, a key question is whether it is important to account for the
fact that macroeconomic data are subject to substantial historical revisions. To the best
of our knowledge, empirical evidence that may help an investor to answer this question
is not yet available. In the earlier empirical literature, only revised macroeconomic data
have been used to analyze macroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility. In
fact, only a few studies are available that report evidence of the implications of using
real-time macroeconomic data for research in empirical finance (see, for example,

Christoffersen et al. 2002, Andersen et al. 2003, Clark and Kozicki 2004, and Guo
2003). By contrast, the analysis of real-time macroeconomic data has a long tradition in
research on macroeconomics and business-cycle fluctuations (Croushore 2001,
Croushore and Stark 2003, Orphanides and van Norden 2002, Orphanides and Williams
2002, and Gerberding et al. 2005, to name just a few).
Our contribution to the literature on the macroeconomic determinants of stock
market volatility is threefold. First, by using a new monthly real-time macroeconomic
data set for Germany that covers the period 1994-2005, we accounted for the fact that,
in real time, an investor can only make inferences about the macroeconomic
determinants of stock market volatility by fully exploiting the then available
information set. This information set only contains the then latest release of preliminary
real-time macroeconomic data, but not later releases of revised macroeconomic data.
We also accounted for the fact that, in real time, an investor must take into account that
preliminary real-time macroeconomic data may only give a noisy account of business
cycle fluctuations. Therefore, we analyzed three different potential macroeconomic
determinants of stock market volatility: the growth rate of industrial production, orders
inflow, and a measure of the output gap. In the earlier literature, empirical studies of the
macroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility have focused on the growth rate
of industrial production as a measure of business cycle fluctuations (Schwert 1989,
Campbell et al. 2001).
Second, we employed a recursive modeling approach to analyze whether
macroeconomic variables help to forecast stock market volatility in real time. By doing
this, we accounted for the fact that an investor's information set changes over time. In
the earlier literature, it has been common practice to use an information set based on a
full-sample of revised data to analyze whether macroeconomic variables help to forecast
stock market volatility (Schwert 1989). Such an information set, however, is not
available to an investor in real time. In consequence, it cannot be used by an investor to
price derivative securities and to solve portfolio allocation problems in real time. In
order to capture changes in an investor's information set over time, we employed a
recursive modeling approach (Pesaran and Timmermann 1995, 2000). An advantage of
using a recursive modeling approach is that it also allows the out-of-sample forecasting
ability of macroeconomic variables for stock market volatility to be analyzed. Out-of-
3
sample tests have received increasing attention in the recent empirical finance literature
(Rapach et al. 2005, Sollis 2005).
Third, we used three different criteria to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts of
stock market volatility. The first criterion is a statistical criterion. We used the root-
mean squared error as a statistical criterion to evaluate volatility forecasts. The
advantage of this statistical criterion is that it has been widely used in academic research
and can easily be applied by practitioners. The second criterion is the utility-based
criterion developed by West et al. (1993) and recently applied by Fleming et al. (2001)
to evaluate volatility forecasts. The utility-based criterion provides a microeconomic
foundation for forecast evaluation. The third criterion is an option-based criterion to
evaluate volatility forecasts. Similar criteria have been developed by Engle et al. (1996)
and Engle et al. (1997). The idea behind the option-based criterion is to simulate a
synthetic options market in which investors trade options based on their different
volatility forecasts. By comparing profits of investors, it is possible to evaluate
differences between volatility forecasts in economic terms.
Our main result is that the value of volatility forecasts based on real-time
macroeconomic data is roughly comparable to the value of volatility forecasts based on
revised macroeconomic data. Forecasting stock market volatility by means of noisy
real-time rather than reliable revised macroeconomic data does not systematically
reduce investors' average utility. Furthermore, an investor who used real-time
macroeconomic data for volatility forecasting would have realized profits in our
synthetic options market comparable to those an investor would have reaped who based
volatility forecasts on revised macroeconomic data. Our result, thus, demonstrates that
an investor who wants to set up an investment strategy in real time can in general make
use of results reported in the earlier literature on the macroeconomic determinants of
stock market volatility that were derived by using revised macroeconomic variables.
We organize the remainder of this paper as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the
recursive modeling approach we used to study the implications of using real-time
macroeconomic data for forecasting stock market volatility. We also lay out the criteria
we used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts of stock market volatility. In Section 3, we
describe the macroeconomic and financial data we considered to be relevant for
4
forecasting stock market volatility. In Section 4, we present our results. In Section 5, we
offer some concluding remarks.
2. Modeling and Evaluating Volatility Forecasts
In order to simulate how an investor may forecast stock market volatility in real
time, we used a recursive modeling approach. In order to evaluate the accuracy of
forecasts implied by our recursive modeling approach, we used a statistical, a utility-
based, and an options-based criterion. We used our recursive modeling approach and the
three forecast-evaluation criteria to compare forecasts of stock market volatility based
on real-time macroeconomic data with forecasts based on revised macroeconomic data.
2.1 Recursive Modeling of Stock Market Volatility
We considered an investor who uses a set of macroeconomic and financial
variables to predict stock market volatility. In period of time t, the information set of the
investor contains real-time information on macroeconomic and financial variables up to
and including period of time t. The investor seeks to combine these variables in an
optimal forecasting model for stock market volatility. The investor does not know
which variables to include in the optimal model, nor does the investor know the true
parameters of the optimal model. As in Pesaran and Timmermann (1995, 2000), we
assumed that the investor applies a recursive modeling approach in order to identify the
optimal forecasting model. This recursive modeling approach proceeds in two steps. In
a first step, the optimal forecasting model for stock market volatility is identified. This
is done by searching the optimal forecasting model, in each period of time, in a
systematic way over a large number of different models that feature different
macroeconomic and financial variables. In a second step, this search recursively restarts
in order to permanently update the optimal forecasting model as time progresses.
In each period of time, t, the investor considers a set of K macroeconomic and
financial variables that may be useful for making a one-period-ahead forecast of stock
market volatility. The optimal forecasting model in period t is identified by searching
over all possible permutations of the variables under consideration. From this it follows,
5
that the number of forecasting models becomes very large as the number of variables
increases. For example, we considered in our empirical analysis nine macroeconomic
and financial variables to be relevant for forecasting one-period-ahead stock market
volatility. In order to conduct this search over a large number of forecasting models in
an efficient and timely manner, we followed Pesaran and Timmermann (1995, 2000)
and used the ordinary least squares technique to estimate, in each period of time t, linear
regression models of the following format:
i
t
i

i

' +
+
+
= 
 , (1)
where
1
+
t
y denotes the vector of changes in the natural logarithm of stock market
volatility from period 0 up to and including period 1
+
t . We model changes in the
natural logarithm of stock market volatility because we used, as we will describe in
detail in Section 2.2.3, an options-based criterion to model stock market volatility. In
the options literature, it has become common practice to assume that volatility follows a
geometric stochastic process (see, for example, Hull and White 1987, Heston 1993).
The subscript i denotes the model the investor studies,
i
 denotes the vector of
parameters under model i,
i
t ,
1
+
 denotes a stochastic disturbance term, and
i
t
X
,
denotes
the set of regressors under model i. The set of regressors under model i,
i
t
X
,
, is a subset
of the set of all macroeconomic and financial regressors the investor considers to be
relevant for forecasting stock market volatility. The vector of regressors always includes
a constant.
In order to identify the optimal forecasting model, the investor needs a model-
selection criterion to select, in each period of time t, the optimal forecasting model
among the large number of estimated forecasting models. We assumed that the investor
considers three alternative model-selection criteria: the Adjusted Coefficient of
Determination (ACD), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, Akaike 1973), and the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, Schwarz 1978). The ACD, AIC, and BIC model-
selection criteria have two key advantages. First, these model-selection criteria are
6
widely used in applied research and an investor can easily compute them. Second, these
model-selection criteria were readily available to investors during the entire sample
period. This is important because our plan is to simulate how an investor forecasts stock
market volatility in real time. Hence, it is important that the investor bases forecasts of
stock market volatility only on information and model-selection criteria which were
available in the period of time in which the forecasts had to be made.
2.2 Forecast-Evaluation Criteria
In order to evaluate and compare volatility forecasts made on the basis of real-
time and revised macroeconomic data, we used three different criteria: a statistical
criterion, a utility-based criterion, and an options-based criterion.
2.2.1 Statistical Criterion
We used the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the statistical accuracy
of forecasts of stock market volatility. The RMSE is defined as the square root of the
mean of the sum of the squared differences between forecasts of stock market volatility
and actual stock market volatility. In addition to the RMSE, we also computed a statistic
in the tradition of the U statistic that has been suggested by Theil (1966). Our version of
Theil's U statistic compares the accuracy of forecasts from a forecasting model that uses
real-time macroeconomic data with that from a forecasting model that uses revised
macroeconomic data. We computed our U statistic as the ratio of the RMSE of a
forecasting model that uses real-time macroeconomic data and the RMSE of a
forecasting model that uses revised macroeconomic data. Thus, our U statistic is defined
as follows:
revised
time
real
RMSE
RMSE
U = (2)
7
2.2.2 Utility-Based Criterion
A utility-based criterion provides a microeconomic foundation for the evaluation
of the accuracy of volatility forecasts. In order to set up a utility-based criterion, we
followed West et al. (1993) and considered a mean-variance maximizing investor who
maximizes the following utility function:

maximizing (3) with respect to f subject to (4) and assuming that the investor's

We assume that the investor knows the conditional mean of stock returns, but does not
know the conditional variance,
1

h . One could extend the analysis to incorporate the
effects of estimation risk with regard to mean returns on the investor's investment
decision (Fleming et al. 2001). However, this estimation risk would affect investment
decisions based on both volatility forecasts derived from real-time and revised
macroeconomic data. Thus, our utility-based measures should reliably indicate the
relative value of volatility forecasts.
The investor uses the recursive estimation approach described in Section 2.1 to
obtain forecasts of the conditional variance,

compute the conditional expectations and the conditional variance of wealth in period

Because the investor does not know

used to evaluate forecasts of stock market volatility. However, West et al. (1993) have

Average utility as defined in (7) can be compared across models in order to
evaluate the accuracy of forecasts of stock market volatility. To this end, we followed
West et al. (1993) and expressed differences in the accuracy of forecasts of stock market
volatility across models in terms of a wealth-sacrifice ratio. This wealth-sacrifice ratio is
expressed in terms of annual basis points. Denoting average utility of an optimal model

represent the average fee that the investor would be willing to pay to switch from a
suboptimal forecasting model, m, to the optimal forecasting model.
2.2.3 Options-Based Criterion
The options-based criterion we used to analyze the accuracy of forecasts of stock
market volatility is similar to the options-based criteria developed by Engle et al. (1996)
and Engle et al. (1997). They have suggested simulating a synthetic options market to
test the relative accuracy of volatility forecasts. In the options market that we simulated,
two traders interact. One trader derives forecasts of stock market volatility from a model
that features real-time macroeconomic data, and the other trader from a model that
10
features revised macroeconomic data. Both traders trade one-month options on a one
euro share of the DAX30 portfolio. In each period of time, traders invest in a "straddle",
that is, they invest in one European call option and one European put option. The strike
prices of both options is equal to the forward rate, )

stock market volatility, both traders use the Black-Scholes formula to value options

Depending on their forecasts of stock market volatility, traders are either long or
short in a straddle. The trader whose volatility forecast is larger buys one straddle, and
the trader whose volatility forecast is smaller sells one straddle. If traders' volatility
forecasts are identical, we assume that both are short in one straddle. Transactions are
executed at the average of the seller's and buyer's price. At the end of a month, buyers
and sellers positions are closed and profits/losses are computed. We used the realized

3. The Data
The description of our data comes in three parts. In the first part, we describe our
data on stock market volatility. In the second part, we describe our real-time
macroeconomic data for Germany. In the third part, we describe the other variables we
considered to be of potential importance for forecasting stock market volatility.
11
3.1 Stock Market Volatility
In order to measure stock market volatility, we used data on the VDAX-NEW
index collected and disseminated by the German stock exchange (Deutsche Boerse).
The VDAX-NEW index is an options-based index of stock market volatility that
summarizes market participants' sentiment regarding the standard deviation of returns
of the DAX30. The VDAX-NEW index measures the square root of the implied
variances. It has a constant time-to-maturity of 30 days. This is convenient because our
macroeconomic data are available at a monthly frequency. The Deutsche Boerse
computes the VDAX-NEW index based on the implied variances of at-the-money and
out-of-the-money options with the same time-to-maturity. Because both at-the-money
and out-of-the-money options are considered, the VDAX-NEW index summarizes
information on the shape of the volatility-strike structure (the so-called "volatility
smile"). Data for the VDAX-NEW index are available at a daily frequency for the
period 1992/1-2005/4. We used end-of-month data in our empirical analysis in order to
avoid problems due to overlapping data. Figure 1 plots the VDAX-NEW index for the
period we considered in our forecasting analysis (1995-2005). A detailed description of
how the VDAX-NEW index is computed can be found in Deutsche Boerse (2005).

Because stock market volatility is not directly observable, various estimators have
been developed in the literature. In consequence, using an options-based index is only
one choice an investor can make to estimate stock market volatility. Because alternative
estimators are available, an investor could ask whether the results we shall report in
Section 4 are sensitive to the choice of the estimator of stock market volatility. In order
to analyze the sensitivity of our results, we did not only study our options-based index
of stock market volatility, but also considered two alternative estimators. The first
alternative estimator is the monthly average of squared stock market returns. For an
investor, it is very simple to compute this estimator in real time. The second alternative
estimator is a GARCH model. To this end, we used daily data on returns of the DAX30
to estimate a GARCH(1,1) model and stored the conditional volatility of returns implied
by this model. We then computed monthly averages of the estimated conditional
volatility. We found that both alternative estimators yielded estimates of stock market
volatility that resemble the options-based VDAX-NEW index of stock market volatility.
Thus, using the two alternative estimators of stock market volatility does not affect our
main result that the statistical and economic value of volatility forecasts based on real-
time data is comparable to the value of forecasts based on revised macroeconomic data.
We, therefore, report in Section 4 only results for our options-based volatility index.
Results for the other two estimators of stock market volatility are available from us
upon request.
3.2 Real-Time Macroeconomic Data for Germany
In order to study the macroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility, we
used a monthly real-time macroeconomic dataset for important macroeconomic
business-cycle indicators for the German economy. The dataset was provided by the
Deutsche Bundesbank. Data sources are the Bundesbank's regularly published monthly
publications of seasonally adjusted macroeconomic data (Saisonbereinigte
Wirtschaftszahlen). We used real-time data for month-to-month growth rates of
industrial production (without construction) and orders inflow. In addition, we
computed a real-time measure of the output gap. The output gap is defined as the
difference between actual output and potential output. We measured potential output by
13
applying the Hodrick-Prescott filter (Hodrick and Prescott 1997) to our real-time data
for industrial production, where we set the smoothing parameter to 14,400. Finally, we
used real-time data for the annualized growth rate of the consumer-price index as a real-
time measure of inflation.
Data were available for every month since January 1994. Our sample of real-time
macroeconomic data starts in 1994 because all data releases from this period of time
onwards refer to Germany as a whole. The data are organized in vintages. A vintage
contains the time series of a macroeconomic variable that was available to an investor in
a given period of time. Hence, because our sample period is 1995/1-2005/3, we could
use in our empirical analysis 123 vintages of each macroeconomic variable. In order to
start our recursive modeling approach, we added to each vintage data that go back to
November 1991. To be more specific, we started our recursive modeling approach by
assuming that the investor uses the period 1991/1-1994/12 as a training period to get
initial estimates of the model-selection criteria.
In our empirical analyses, we accounted for the fact that macroeconomic data are
usually published with a time lag. We also accounted for the fact that the publication lag
changed over time. For example, in the case of industrial production the year 1995
provides a remarkable example for irregularities with regard to the publication of
macroeconomic data. In the year 1995, the German Federal Statistical Office did not
publish data on industrial production from February to June. The reason for this
interruption of the usual publication rhythm was a conceptual change in the calculation
of the time series. From June to August 1995, it published two data per month to get
back to the regular publication lag of two months. We dealt with irregularities in the
publication of macroeconomic data by considering an investor who always used the
then latest publicly available data. In case no new data were released, we assumed that
the investor used the then most recent data of the then most recently published vintage
to fill any gaps in the data. This assumption does not distort the information set
available to an investor because it implies that the investor only uses then publicly
available data to forecast excess returns.

Note: In this table, we provide summary statistics for revisions after one month, two months, six months,
one year, and final revisions (i.e., revisions at the end of our sample period). For example, revisions after
one month are computed by taking the difference between the first release and the second release of data.
The noise-to-signal, NSR, is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of revisions and the standard
deviation of final-release data. CPI is defined as the consumer price index inflation.
15
In order to analyze differences between real-time and revised macroeconomic
data, we provide summary statistics of revisions of our real-time macroeconomic data in
Table 1. The summary statistics in Table 1 indicate that, as a rule, revisions do not have
a zero mean, suggesting that there are some systematic differences between data
belonging to different vintages. Moreover, the noise-to-signal ratios are substantial. The
noise-to-signal ratio is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of revisions and the
standard deviation of revised data (Orphanides and van Norden 2002). The noise-to-
signal ratios reveal that the standard deviations of revisions are at least about one third
as large as the standard deviation of the revised data. There are even some cases in
which the standard deviation of revisions exceeds the standard deviation of the revised
data. Furthermore, the minimum and maximum values of revisions are quite large. This
implies that an investor who must use first-releases of our macroeconomic data to
forecast stock returns uses highly inaccurate macroeconomic data. This motivates a
closer look on the implications of using real-time macroeconomic data for forecasting
stock market volatility.
3.3 Other Variables
In addition to real-time macroeconomic data, we considered a number of other
variables to be potentially relevant for forecasting stock market volatility. We
downloaded most of the data from Thomson Financial Datastream. Our list of variables
is the following (abbreviations and Datastream codes are given in parentheses):
1. The relative three-month Treasury bill rate (RTB) and the term spread
(TSP). RTB is defined as the difference between the three-month Treasury
bill rate (BDI60C..) and its 12-month backward-looking moving average.
TSP is defined as the difference between the long-term government bond
yield (BDI61...) and the three-month Treasury bill rate.
2. A January dummy (JAN). JAN plays an important role in the literature on
financial market anomalies and seasonalities in returns. (See Thaler (1987)
and Haugen and Lakonishok (1988) for surveys of this literature.)
16
3. The difference between the DAX30 (DAXINDZ) and its four-month
(~ approximately 100 trading days) and eight-month (~ approximately 200
trading days) backward-looking moving averages (DMA100; DMA200).
We considered DMA100 and DMA200 as predictors for stock market
volatility because simple moving-average-based trading strategies have
been studied extensively in the literature on technical trading rules (Brock
et al. 1992).
4. The IFO overall business climate indicator (IFO; WGIFOMXLE). Jacobs
and Sturm (2004) have reported that IFO contains information with regard
to revisions of German macroeconomic data. In consequence, it could
have been valuable for investors who must rely on preliminary real-time
macroeconomic data to include IFO in the information set they used to
forecast stock market volatility. Moreover, in contrast to industrial
production and orders inflow, there have been no irregularities with
respect to the publication of the IFO index.
5. The level of the VDAX-NEW index. We used the VDAX-NEW index as a
regressor to take into account that volatility may follow a mean-reverting
process.
4. Results
In Table 2, we summarize how often the macroeconomic and other variables are
selected by our recursive modeling approach as regressors under different model
selection criteria. In the second column, we report results for models that use revised
macroeconomic data as potential regressors. In the third column, we report results for
models that use real-time macroeconomic data as potential regressors. As one would
have expected, an investor who relied upon the BIC criterion would have used only few
regressors to forecast stock market volatility. Moreover, irrespective of the model
selection criterion considered, an investor would have chosen almost always the
VDAX-NEW index as a regressor.

By contrast, the investor's choice of the other regressors would have been highly
dependent on the model selection criteria applied to select a forecasting model. As
concerns the macroeconomic data, the investor would have selected the inflation rate
more often as a regressor than either industrial production, orders inflow, or the output
gap. Finally, there is no general tendency that an investor would have included real-time
macroeconomic data more often in the optimal forecasting model than revised
macroeconomic data, and vice versa.
In order to analyze the accuracy of forecasts of stock market volatility based on real-
time and revised macroeconomic data, we report in Panel A of Table 3 for each model
the RMSE. In Panel B, we document results for the U statistic. A comparison of the
RMSEs shows that no clear ranking of models is apparent. In fact, the results for the U
statistic reveal that forecasting models based on real-time macroeconomic data work as
well as forecasting models based on revised macroeconomic data. This suggests that
preliminary real-time macroeconomic data are as (un-)informative with regard to stock
market volatility as are revised macroeconomic data. In other words, an investor who
must rely on real-time macroeconomic data to forecast stock market volatility would
have done not worse than an investor who had access to revised macroeconomic data to
forecast stock market volatility. Given the large attention that financial market
participants and the mass media often pay to data revisions this result is somewhat
surprising.

Because statistical measures of forecasting ability may not be closely related to
forecasts' profits (Leitch and Tanner 1991), we analyzed a utility-based criterion to
study the implications of using real-time and revised macroeconomic data for
forecasting stock market volatility. In Table 4, we report in Panel A for each model
average utility as defined in (7). In Panel B, we report the wealth-sacrifice ratios one
obtains by comparing average utility of forecasting models based on real-time (revised)
20
macroeconomic data with average utility of the other forecasting models based on real-
time (revised) macroeconomic data. In Panel C, we report the wealth-sacrifice ratios one
obtains by comparing average utility of forecasting models based on real-time
macroeconomic data with average utility of forecasting models based on revised
macroeconomic data. The better forecasting model has a wealth-sacrifice ratio of zero.
In order to assess the robustness of our results, we report results for coefficients of
relative risk aversion of 1

 and 10

 .

As regards the optimal model selection criterion, the results summarized in Table
4 show that an investor who had used the BIC model selection criterion would have
reaped the highest average utility. In contrast, an investor who had used the ACD model
selection criterion would have reaped the lowest average utility. This ranking of model
selection criteria is indifferent to the calibration of the coefficient of relative risk
aversion. As regards forecasting models based on real-time and revised macroeconomic
data, no clear-cut ranking is possible. Under the ACD and the AIC model selection
criteria, forecasting models based on revised macroeconomic data outperform models
based on real-time macroeconomic data. In contrast, under the BIC model selection
criterion, in terms of the wealth-sacrifice ratios, the forecasting models based on real-
time macroeconomic data are better than the forecasting models based on revised
macroeconomic data. However, the differences between models are small because,
under the BIC criterion, macroeconomic variables are included only occasionally in the
optimal forecasting model. All in all, we conclude that an investor who uses our utility-
based criterion to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts of stock market volatility should
use the BIC criterion to select a forecasting model for two reasons. First, choosing the
BIC criterion maximizes average utility. Second, the BIC criterion helps the investor to
minimize the negative impact on average utility that results from the fact that the
investor must use preliminary real-time rather than reliable revised macroeconomic data
for forecasting stock market volatility in real time.
Finally, we report results for our options-based criterion of the accuracy of
forecasts of stock market volatility. In Table 5, we report cumulative profits, the
standard deviation of cumulative profits, and standardized profits that an investor would
have realized who had traded straddles in our synthetic options-market. We computed
standardized profits as the ratio of cumulative profits and their standard deviation.
Profits do not add up to zero because both traders are short in straddles if their forecasts
of stock market volatility are identical. Columns 2-4 summarize results for revised
macroeconomic data, and Columns 5-7 summarize results for real-time macroeconomic
data.
Corroborating the results for the statistical and utility-based criteria, the options-
based criterion does not clearly favor forecasting models based on real-time over
23
forecasting models based on revised macroeconomic data. Thus, in terms of our
options-based criterion, the accuracy of an investor's volatility forecasts does not
change much when reliable revised rather than noisy real-time macroeconomic data are
available for forecasting stock market volatility. Interestingly, however, the standard
deviation of cumulative profits is always relatively small when forecasts of stock
market volatility are based on revised macroeconomic data. Thus, when trading options
based on volatility forecasts derived from revised macroeconomic data, an investor runs
the danger of underestimating the standard deviation of profits. If only forecasting
models based on real-time data are considered, it is clear from the results given in Table
5 that, as was the case with the utility-based criterion, the BIC model selection criterion
performs very well.

5. Conclusion
In real time, an investor faces the problem that only preliminary real-time
macroeconomic data are available for forecasting stock market volatility. The result of
our empirical research using German real-time macroeconomic data may provide some
guidelines for investors for how to deal with this problem. Our main result is that the
statistical and economic value of forecasts of stock market volatility based on real-time
data is comparable to the value of forecasts based on revised macroeconomic data. This
result has two implications. For investors who act in real time, our result implies that
they can safely use real-time macroeconomic data to forecast stock market volatility.
For researchers who ex post analyze macroeconomic and financial data, our result
implies that they can employ revised macroeconomic data to study the equilibrium
relations between macroeconomic variables and stock market volatility. Of course,
before our result can be generalized, much more research has to be done. For example,
it would be interesting to use data for other countries and periods of time to study
further the macroeconomic determinants of stock market volatility in real time.
