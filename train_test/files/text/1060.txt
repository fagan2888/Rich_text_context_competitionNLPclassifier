Context: Epidemiologic surveys have consistently found
that approximately half of respondents who obtained treat-
ment for mental or substance use disorders in the year
before interview did not meet the criteria for any of the
disorders assessed in the survey. Concerns have been
raised that this pattern might represent evidence of mis-
allocation of treatment resources.
Objective: To examine patterns and correlates of 12-
month treatment of mental health or substance use
problems among people who do not have a 12-month
DSM-IV disorder.
Design and Setting: Data are from the National Co-
morbidity Survey Replication, a nationally representa-
tive face-to-face US household survey performed be-
tween February 5, 2001, and April 7, 2003, that assessed
DSM-IV disorders using a fully structured diagnostic in-
terview, the World Health Organization Composite In-
ternational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).
Participants: A total of 5692 English-speaking respon-
dents 18 years and older.
Main Outcome Measures: Patterns of 12-month ser-
vice use among respondents without any 12-month
DSM-IV CIDI disorders.
Results:Ofrespondentswhoused12-monthservices,61.2%
had a 12-month DSM-IV CIDI diagnosis, 21.1% had a life-
timebutnota12-monthdiagnosis,and9.7%hadsomeother
indicatorofpossibleneedfortreatment(subthreshold12-
monthdisorder,serious12-monthstressor,orlifetimehos-
pitalization).Theremaining8.0%ofserviceusersaccounted
for only 5.6% of all services and even lower proportions of
specialty(1.9%-2.4%)andgeneralmedical(3.7%)visitscom-
pared with higher proportions of human services (18.9%)
and complementary and alternative medicine (7.6%) vis-
its.Only26.5%oftheservicesprovidedtothe8.0%ofpre-
sumably low-need patients were delivered in the mental
health specialty or general medical sectors.
Conclusions: Most services provided for emotional or
substance use problems in the United States go to people
with a 12-month diagnosis or other indicators of need.
Patients who lack these indicators of need receive care
largely outside the formal health care system.

A2006 REPORT BY THE INSTI-
tute of Medicine1 de-
scribed a gap in the qual-
ity of mental health care as
great as or greater than that
seen in the rest of the health care system.
The report described a primary goal for
quality improvement of reducing under-
use and overuse of services. In document-
ing problems of underuse of services, the
report cited studies indicating that only ap-
proximately half of persons with serious
mental illnesses receive any treatment
and that fewer than half of those treated
receive care consistent with evidence-
based guidelines.2-6 Government-spon-
sored quality improvement initiatives in
the United States and abroad are seeking
to address the problem of undertreat-
ment of mental disorders through in-
creased public awareness, systematic
screening, and implementation of treat-
ment guidelines.7-9
Overuse,definedas"whenahealthcare
serviceisprovidedundercircumstancesin
whichitspotentialforharmexceedsthepos-
siblebenefit,"10(p1002) isanequallyimportant
but much less well understood concern in
quality assessment. The classic example of
overuse in medicine is the prescription of
antibiotic agents for the common cold,
which is a problem from a clinical perspec-
tive (exposure of patients to unnecessary
risks) and a public health perspective (po-
tential development of resistance).11 Simi-
larly,overtreatmentinmentalhealthwould
present a clinical problem if it exposed pa-
tients to adverse effects or a public health
problem if it diverted resources away from
those with greater evidence of need.12

study of the problem of overuse in mental

sistently found that a substantial proportion of people in
treatment for emotional problems do not meet the criteria

tionalComorbiditySurveyReplication(NCS-R)4 allreported
thatapproximatelyhalfofpersonsusingmentalhealthser-
vices during the year before interview did not meet the cri-
teria for any of the DSM disorders assessed in the surveys.
This pattern is not confined to the United States. Persons
without diagnosed disorders make up most treated cases
inmentalhealthneedsassessmentsurveysthroughoutthe
developedanddevelopingworlds.16-18 Thisconsistentfind-
ing has been interpreted as evidence of potential overuse,
and recommendations have been made based on this con-
clusion to redistribute services from persons without di-
agnoses to those with more serious conditions.18
If overuse of services implies use of services in the ab-
sence of need, then evaluating this problem empirically
requires carefully considering what we mean by the term
need and what we include in the enumeration of mental
health services. Clinical need is a complex concept, best
conceptualized not as a single entity but as a series of over-
lapping constructs, including symptoms, disease bur-
den, treatment effectiveness, and consumer percep-
tions.19-22 In assessing potential need it is critical to
complement diagnosis with other measures of symp-
toms and psychosocial burden and with patients' expla-
nations of why they sought care.
In exploring the implications of use of services in the
absence of diagnosis, it is also critical to understand where
people are receiving their treatment. The types of men-
tal health care that people obtain are heterogeneous, rang-
ing from services delivered in specialty mental health set-
tings, to those provided by general health professionals,
to those obtained from nonprofessionals, such as clergy
and self-help group facilitators.23 Whereas treatment in
the formal health care system (either medical or mental
health) contributes to rising health care costs, treat-
ment delivered outside of those sectors has fewer impli-
cations for allocation of resources.
This study examines the prevalence and characteris-
tics of use of 12-month mental health services in people
without 12-month mental disorders based on the most
comprehensive survey ever conducted of the prevalence
and correlates of mental disorders in the United States. Ex-
tending research from previous epidemiologic surveys, we
seek to understand the extent to which patients who do
not meet the 12-month criteria for any of the disorders as-
sessed in the survey have other indicators of possible need.
We examine the sectors where treatment is received, the
number of visits made to each treatment sector, and pa-
tient self-reported reasons for seeking treatment.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The NCS-R is a nationally representative face-to-face house-
hold survey of respondents 18 years and older in the cotermi-
nous United States conducted between February 5, 2001, and
April 7, 2003.24,25 Part 1 included a core diagnostic assessment
administered to all respondents. Part 2 assessed risk factors,
correlates, service use, and additional disorders and was ad-
ministered to all part 1 respondents with lifetime disorders plus
a probability subsample of other respondents. The overall re-
sponse rate was 70.9%. The part 2 sample, which is the focus
of this study, included all part 1 respondents with a disorder
and a probability subsample of other part 1 respondents, for a
total of 5692 part 2 respondents. Part 2 data were weighted to
adjust for differential probability of selection in households,
differential nonresponse, differential selection of part 1 respon-
dents into part 2, and residual discrepancies with US Census
population data. Recruitment and consent procedures were ap-
proved by the human subjects committees of Harvard Medical
School and the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor).
MEASURES
Diagnostic Assessment of 12-Month
Mental Disorders
The DSM-IV diagnoses were made using the World Health Or-
ganization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
version 3.0,26 a fully structured lay-administered diagnostic in-
terview. The DSM-IV27 criteria were used to generate diag-
noses. The 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorders considered herein
include mood disorders (bipolar I and II disorders, subthresh-
old bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and dysthy-
mia), anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia without
panic, specific phobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety dis-
order, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress dis-
order, and adult separation anxiety disorder), impulse control
disorders (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, opposi-
tional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and
pathological gambling disorder), substance use disorders (al-
cohol and drug abuse with or without dependence), and non-
affective psychosis. All diagnoses were made using organic ex-
clusions and diagnostic hierarchy rules, except for the substance
use disorders, in which abuse was defined with or without de-
pendence. Masked clinical reappraisal interviews using the Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)25,28 showed gen-
erally good concordance between diagnoses based on the CIDI
and the SCID for anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders
but CIDI underestimation of the prevalence of nonaffective psy-
chosis.29 The CIDI lifetime diagnoses of impulse control dis-
orders were not validated.
Other Indicators of Possible Need for Treatment
Respondents who did not meet the 12-month criteria for any
of the previously mentioned DSM-IV disorders were divided
into subsamples based on a 3-category gradient of possible need
for treatment: (1) those with at least 1 lifetime DSM-IV/CIDI
disorder; (2) those with 1 or more indicators of severity; that
is, 12-month subthreshold disorders (ie, lacking only 1 crite-
rion for a diagnosis), exposure to a major stressful event (eg,
rape or divorce) in the past 12 months, and lifetime hospital-
ization for a mental disorder; and (3) those without any life-
time diagnosis or other indicator of possible need.
12-Month Use of Mental Health Services
All part 2 respondents were asked whether they had ever re-
ceived treatment for "problems with your emotions or nerves or
your use of alcohol or drugs." A list of types of treatment profes-
sionals and a separate list of settings were presented in a respon-

dent booklet to provide a visual recall aid. Separate assessments
were made for different types of professionals, support groups,
self-help groups, mental health crisis hotlines, and complemen-
tary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. Follow-up
questions were asked about ages at the first and most recent
contacts and about number of visits in the past 12 months.
Reports of 12-month service use were classified into the fol-
lowing predefined categories: psychiatrist, nonpsychiatrist men-
tal health specialist (psychologist or other nonpsychiatrist men-
tal health professional in any setting, social worker or counselor
in a mental health specialty setting, and use of a mental health
hotline),generalmedicalprovider(primarycaredoctor,othergen-
eral medical doctor, nurse, and any other health professional not
previously mentioned), human services professional (religious or
spiritualadvisorandsocialworkerorcounselorinanysettingother
than a specialty mental health setting), and CAM (any other type
of healer, such as a chiropractor, participation in an Internet sup-
port group, or participation in a self-help group).
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
Basic patterns of service use were examined by computing
proportions in treatment and mean numbers of visits among
those in treatment. Logistic regression30 analysis was used to
study predictors of 12-month treatment and treatment in par-
ticular sectors among those receiving any treatment. Standard
errors were estimated using the Taylor series method31 and
implemented using a software system (SUDAAN version
8.0.1; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina). Logits and their 95% confidence intervals
were transformed into odds ratios (ORs) for ease of interpre-
tation. Multivariate significance tests in the logistic regression
analyses were made using Wald 2 tests based on coefficient
variance-covariance matrices that were adjusted for design ef-
fects using the Taylor series method. Statistical significance
was evaluated using 2-sided design-based tests and the P.05
level of significance.
RESULTS
PATTERNS OF 12-MONTH TREATMENT
As reported previously,4 17.9% of NCS-R respondents ob-
tained some type of treatment for problems with their
mental health or substance use in the 12 months before
interview. There was a strong monotonic relationship be-
tween the gradient of possible need and the probability
of treatment, with 39.9% of respondents with 12-month
DSM-IV/CIDI disorders obtaining treatment compared
with 18.3% of those with lifetime but not 12-month dis-
orders, 12.7% of those without any lifetime disorder but
with another indicator of possible need, and 3.8% of those
without any indicator of possible need (Table 1). Mean
number of visits among patients was significantly re-
lated to the gradient as well, with the highest mean (16.5
visits) among patients with 12-month disorders and the
lowest means among patients without lifetime disor-
ders either in the presence (8.4 visits) or absence (10.3
visits) of other indicators of possible need. Of all pa-
tients who obtained treatment, 61.2% met the criteria for
1 or more of the 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorders as-
sessed in the survey. These 12-month cases accounted
for 69.0% of all visits. An additional 21.1% of patients
had a lifetime disorder (19.9% of all visits), and the re-
maining 17.7% of patients (11.1% of visits) did not meet
the criteria for any lifetime or 12-month disorder.
Patients with 12-month disorders accounted for higher
proportions of visits to psychiatrists (73.5%), other men-
tal health professionals (74.3%), and general medical pro-
fessionals (74.3%) than to human services (60.8%) and
CAM (60.7%) professionals (detailed results available on
request). Patients with lifetime but not 12-month disor-
ders accounted for a higher proportion of visits to CAM
professionals (27.7%) than to other treatment sectors
(14.1%-17.8%). Persons without any of the disorders as-
sessed in the survey and without any other indicator of
possible need, in comparison, accounted for a higher pro-
portion of visits to the human services sector (18.9%) than
to other sectors (1.9%-7.6%).
These differences resulted in variation in treatment pro-
files across sectors among patients in each subsample of
the gradient of possible need (Table 2). Among patients
with a 12-month diagnosis, more than half of all visits
(55.1%) were delivered by either a psychiatrist (13.7%) or
another mental health professional (41.4%), and another

9.7% were delivered in the general medical sector. This
means that nearly two-thirds of all visits (64.8%) by pa-
tients with a 12-month disorder were made in the formal
health care sector. These are all higher proportions than
among patients with a lifetime but not a 12-month disor-
der, for whom 45.5% of visits were delivered by a mental
health professional and 6.5% by a general medical profes-
sional (52.0% in a health care sector), and among patients
without either a lifetime disorder or any of the indicators
of potential need (26.5% in a health care sector). Regard-
ing this last result, 73.5% of the visits of patients classified
as having the least evidence of need were provided out-
side of the health care system, in either the human ser-
vices sector (30.7%) or the CAM sector (42.8%). The high-
est proportion of visits in a health care sector (70.5%), in
comparison, was made by patients without a lifetime dis-
order but with some other indicator of possible need.
PREDICTORS OF 12-MONTH TREATMENT
AMONG RESPONDENTS WITHOUT
12-MONTH DISORDERS
Logistic regression analysis documented a variety of sig-
nificant predictors of 12-month treatment among re-
spondents who met the criteria for 1 or more lifetime dis-
orders but none of the 12-month disorders (Table 3).
These predictors include a high number (4) of life-
time disorders (OR, 4.0), lifetime hospitalization for a
mental illness or substance use problem (OR, 2.5), most
recent episode within 1 year of the 12-month recall pe-
riod (OR, 3.2), a subthreshold episode within the 12-
month recall period (OR, 2.4), and a major stressful event
within the 12-month recall period (OR, 2.3). Respon-
dents with lifetime bipolar disorder also had a meaning-
fully elevated OR of 12-month treatment (OR, 1.9), al-
though this was only of marginal significance (P=.07).
Significant predictors of 12-month treatment among re-
spondents who did not meet the criteria for any of the
disorders considered herein include lifetime hospitaliza-
tion (OR, 4.1), a subthreshold episode within the 12-
month recall period (OR, 3.1), and a major stressful event
within the 12-month recall period (OR, 2.9).
A weighted count was created of individual-level pre-
dictors of treatment among respondents who did not meet
the criteria for a 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorder by sum-
ming the indicators of possible need with weights based
on the ORs in Table 3. In the subsample of these respon-
dents who met the criteria for 1 or more lifetime disor-

tor (data available on request).
REASONS FOR SEEKING TREATMENT AMONG
PERSONS WITH AND WITHOUT DIAGNOSES
Respondents who received treatment were asked their rea-
sons for doing so. This question series began by asking pa-
tients whether they sought treatment based on their own
perceived need for professional help or only because some-
one else urged them to do so. Most patients in all sub-
samples(67.3%-76.0%)reportedthattheyperceivedthem-
selves as needing treatment (Table 6). However, this
percentage varied significantly across subsamples (2

nificant subsample differences were found in most rea-
sons for seeking treatment, with patients who had a 12-

COMMENT
The results reported herein show that most people who
use services for mental health or substance use problems
in the United States have either a DSM diagnosis or some
other indicator of possible need for treatment. These find-
ings extend those of previous studies in showing that a
substantial percentage of service users did not have any
of the 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI diagnoses assessed in the
survey4,13-15 despite the fact that a much wider range of con-
ditions was considered herein than in earlier studies. How-
ever, when we focused on number of visits, we found that
the nearly two-thirds of mental health service users who
had a 12-month diagnosis accounted for approximately
three-quarters of all professional visits for mental health
or substance use problems. These results may help re-
duce concerns based on the findings of previous epide-
miologic surveys that a high proportion of services are pro-
vided to patients who do not have a DSM disorder.
We also found that patients with lifetime but not 12-
month diagnoses made up most other 12-month service
users in the NCS-R. In this subsample of respondents,
those with recent episodes were significantly more likely
than others to be undergoing 12-month treatment, sug-
gesting that they may be receiving time-limited treat-
ment for recent episodes. Use of services among other
patients with lifetime disorders may reflect the growing
awareness that maintenance treatment is important for
relapse prevention in people with a history of serious con-
ditions.32-34 The fact that indicators of lifetime severity
(number of diagnoses and lifetime history of hospital-
ization) were significant predictors of 12-month treat-
ment is consistent with this hypothesis. This pattern is
consistent with earlier NCS-R findings that allocation of
services is significantly associated with burden of ill-
ness in patients with 12-month diagnoses.15,17,18
To the extent that maintenance treatment is taking
place, asymptomatic patients with lifetime disorders in
12-month treatment may be treatment success stories.
The comparatively high proportion of people with life-
time bipolar disorder in 12-month treatment despite not
having a 12-month manic-hypomanic or depressive epi-
sode is an especially important case in point given the
literature suggesting the value of maintenance therapy
in this population.33,35 The fact that asymptomatic people
with lifetime diagnoses had fewer visits than those with
more symptoms or risk factors further suggests an un-
derlying rationality in resource allocation among stable
patients receiving maintenance treatment.
The finding that a meaningful proportion of services
is provided to patients who do not meet either 12-month
or lifetime criteria for any of the DSM-IV disorders as-
sessed in the NCS-R raises a more complex set of clinical
and policy concerns. More than three-fourths of these pa-
tients had a subthreshold 12-month condition, reported

aData are given as percentage (SE) except where indicated otherwise. Percentages in part 1 are based on the weighted numbers of respondents in treatment in
each subsample. Percentages in part 2 are based on the weighted numbers of respondents in treatment with perceived need for treatment in each subsample. The
column totals sum to more than 100% because respondents could give multiple reasons.
bPerceived need for treatment is defined as respondents reporting that they sought treatment based, at least in part, on the recognition that they needed
professional help as opposed to seeking help only because someone else urged them to do so.

a serious 12-month stressor, or had a history of hospital-
ization. Subthreshold syndromes are currently less well
defined than threshold diagnoses, and relatively little is
known about the risks and benefits of treating these con-
ditions.36,37 Nonetheless, particularly in the presence of se-
rious psychosocial stressors, arguments have been made
that treatment of subthreshold syndromes can have value
not only in reducing present distress and suffering but in
preventingthefutureonsetofsyndromaldisorders.38-40 The
fact that in this subsample a dose-response relationship
exists between number of indicators of potential need and
serviceusesuggeststhattreatmentdecisionsarebeingmade
based on these types of considerations. More generally, our
findings support the notion that need for care may be more
appropriately thought of as a continuum than as a cat-
egorical construct.
Only a small proportion (8.0%) of service users did not
have any of the indicators of need considered herein. For
a wide range of medical interventions, it is commonly nec-
essary to have some false-positive rate of treatment. For
example, a review of the appendectomy literature found
an inverse relationship between the perforation rate and
the surgeon's false-positive rate, leading the authors to rec-
ommend that a 23% error rate (removal of a normal ap-
pendix)wouldbeappropriate.41 Formentaldisorders,pub-
lic health efforts such as social marketing and antistigma
campaigns may simultaneously increase the rate of care
in persons with and without disorders.42 Thus, some level
of overtreatment may be an acceptable, and even desir-
able, consequence of efforts to reduce the problem of un-
dertreatment of mental disorders.
Although service users without potential indicators of
need reported similar reasons for using services as other
mentalhealthserviceusers,theyweremuchlesslikelythan
other patients to receive their care in the formal health care
system and much more likely to be treated in the human
services sector. This means that these presumably low-
need patients are not contributing importantly to formal
mental health expenditures, nor do they divert a substan-
tial proportion of professional resources away from pa-
tients with diagnosable disorders. They account for only
1.9% to 2.4% of all visits to psychiatrists and other men-
tal health professionals and 3.7% of all visits to general
medical professionals for mental health or substance use
problems.Notethat44.8%ofthesepatientswhousedCAM
services reported that prayer was the main service pro-
vided. This finding is consistent with previous research
demonstrating the common use of prayer43 and clergy vis-
its44 in the United States for problems in daily life.
These results should be interpreted with the follow-
ing 2 limitations in mind. First, the CIDI does not pro-
vide a fully comprehensive assessment of all DSM-IV dis-
orders, nor is it completely accurate in the diagnoses it
assesses, as it is somewhat conservative relative to the
SCID. As a result, some of the respondents classified as
not having had a 12-month disorder actually had one.
Second, the study relied on self-reported measures of ser-
vice use. Because reporting bias for mental health ser-
vices seems to be greatest in persons with high levels of
distress,45 such bias may be less of a concern for the popu-
lation of primary interest in the present study (ie, pa-
tients with low evidence of need for treatment).
Although the study's findings should provide some re-
assurance regarding the magnitude of overtreatment of
mental health and substance use problems in the United
States, there is still much work to be done to ensure that
mental health resources are used effectively and effi-
ciently.45 Overuse can be a problem not only for persons
without need who receive services but also for individu-
als with evidence of need who receive poor-quality ser-
vices. From an economic perspective, poor quality of care
represents wasted resources.46,47 The present study sug-
gests that efforts to reduce waste need to shift from
whether the wrong persons are receiving mental health
care to ensuring that those who do receive care receive
the right services, in the right manner, and at the right
time.
