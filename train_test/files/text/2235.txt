In a prospective cohort of nondisabled adults aged 65 years or more in the Established Populations for Epidemio-
logic Studies of the Elderly (1981­1987 and 1985­1992), we used a competing risk approach to predict the 5-year
risk of severe, persistent activities-of-daily-living (ADLs) disability, defined as dependence in 3 ADLs for 2 consecu-
tive annual interviews or for 1 interview followed by death in the subsequent year. During 5 years, 6.8% developed
severe, persistent ADL dependence, and 14.6% died without severe, persistent ADL dependence in the derivation
cohort (n = 8,301); the corresponding percentages were 6.8% and 15.8% in the validation cohort (n = 4,177). A
model based on age, current employment, visual impairment, self-rated health, diabetes mellitus, history of stroke or
brain hemorrhage, cognitive function, and self-reported physical function showed good calibration. Discrimination,
assessed by C statistics, for <70, 70­74, 75­79, and 80 years, was 0.75, 0.74, 0.65, and 0.66 in the derivation
cohort and 0.70, 0.72, 0.70, and 0.65 in the validation cohort, respectively. In conclusion, a simple risk score based
on routinely available clinical information can predict severe, persistent disability in 5 years. Future studies should
examine whether physical performance measures can further improve prediction in the oldest old.

Despite primary prevention efforts and therapeutic advance-
ments, recent data in the United States suggest an expansion
of life with disability, rather than compression of morbidity
(1). Over 20% of older Americans reported at least 1 activity-
of-daily-living (ADL) disability, and long-term-care expendi-
ture for disabled older adults reached $135 billion in 2004 (2).
With the growing interest in quality of life and health-care cost
reduction, ADL dependence is a meaningful, patient-oriented
outcome because individual disease­oriented outcomes often
fail to capture the overall impact of multiple comorbidities
on a person's function. It also predicts institutionalization (3),
home service use (4), hospitalization (5), and mortality (6).
Extensive research has identified a wide range of risk fac-
tors for ADL disability, including low socioeconomic status,
sensory impairment, poor self-reported health, comorbidities,
cognitive and physical functional impairment, and subclinical
disease. However, the translation of research into clinical pre-
diction has been slow. Although several prognostic tools are
available (7­12), they are often resource intensive or require
trained assessors (7­11). Some focused on mortality (12).
Moreover, previous research did not consider the dynamic
nature of disability or competing events that alter the risk of
disability. In the era of health-care reform, identifying indi-
viduals who are more likely to lose their ability to live inde-
pendently and utilize more resources is crucial to achieve
more appropriate care, cost control, and meaningful use of
resources.
This study aimed to develop and validate a practical tool
that predicts 5-year risk of severe, persistent loss of indepen-
dence in performing ADLs in a large representative cohort
of community-dwelling older adults, using information that
can be easily obtained in a general practice setting.

cohort study of noninstitutionalized adults, aged 65 years or
more, in 4 US communities (13). The details of study design
and conduct were described elsewhere (14­16). Participants
underwent baseline interviews in 1981­1982, except in the
North Carolina cohort (in 1985­1986), and annual follow-
up interviews for 6 years. Because additional interviews beyond
6 years were conducted in selected cohorts with varying inter-
vals, we used data up to the sixth annual follow-up. After
excluding 248 participants with missing data on more than
50% of potential predictors and 1,665 participants with ADL
dependence at baseline, 12,478 participants were included
in this analysis. The institutional review boards at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center and Hebrew SeniorLife exempted
this study.
Definition of ADL dependence and other outcomes
Disability in 7 ADLs was self-reported at baseline and
subsequent annual interviews, using the following question:
"Other than when you have been in a hospital, was there any
time in the past 12 months when you needed help from
some person or equipment to do . . . (each of the following
activities)?" for walking across a small room, bathing or
shower, personal grooming, dressing, eating, getting from a
bed to a chair, or using the toilet. Whether the help was from
another person, equipment, or both was also asked: We con-
sidered requiring personal assistance to define ADL depen-
dence. The event of interest was severe, persistent ADL
dependence, defined as requiring personal help in 3 ADLs
for at least 2 consecutive annual interviews or for 1 interview
followed by death in the subsequent year to capture pro-
longed, severe disability status that is comparable to requir-
ing a significant amount of personal assistance or nursing
home care. Those who died during the follow-up without
severe, persistent ADL dependence were considered as hav-
ing experienced the competing event (refer to "Statistical
analysis" below). As our outcome was defined on the basis
of ADL status in 2 consecutive annual interviews, the fifth
year was the last possible time in which the outcome could
occur. Our definition of disability reduces misclassification
from self-report and is more strongly associated with adverse
outcomes and resource utilization than other definitions (e.g.,
self-reported difficulty, impairment in any ADLs, or disability
at a single assessment) (17­21).
Vital status was obtained through obituaries, hospitaliza-
tion records, proxy interviews, and death certificates. Hos-
pitalizations during the past 12 months were self-reported
(yes/no) for selected conditions (myocardial infarction,
stroke, cancer, and fracture). Assuming that each condition
was associated with a distinct hospitalization, we summed
the number of hospitalizations for 5 years.
Potential predictors
We chose 30 potential predictors of ADL disability that
were identified from literature and collected via question-
naire and in-person assessment in the EPESE (Web Table 1
available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). Multiple response
categories for certain predictors were collapsed to ensure a
sufficient number of events in each category, to improve
interpretability, and to reduce model complexity without
compromising model fit. Cognitive function was measured by
using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (22), a
validated instrument that comprises 10 questions on memory,
orientation, current events, and a mathematical task. Cog-
nitive function was classified as "normal" if the number of
errors was 2; "mild" if 3 or 4; and "moderate to severe" if
5 (22). A cutpoint of 3 errors corresponds to the Mini-
Mental Status Examination score of 23 (23). Because physical
performance was measured at the sixth annual examination
in the EPESE cohort, we used self-reported physical func-
tion obtained from questionnaires. These measures have been
shown to be reproducible and validated against performance-
based measures (24, 25).
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed in Stata/SE 11.2 software
(StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). Two-sided P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. The data set was ran-
domly divided into a derivation cohort (2/3; n = 8,301) and
avalidation cohort (1/3; n = 4,177). Characteristics were com-
pared between the 2 cohorts by using the t test or Wilcoxon
rank-sum test for continuous variables and the Pearson 2
test for categorical variables.
Missing data imputation. For those who had any interval
missing on the number of ADL dependencies (7.4%), we
imputed the missing values with the last nonmissing values
for that individual carried forward. At baseline, 2.7% had
missing data on more than 5 predictors. We implemented
multivariable imputation that used all baseline variables, the
time-to-event variable, and outcome status.
Model development. We used cause-specific propor-
tional hazards regression to model the time to first occur-
rence of severe, persistent ADL dependence as a function of
predictors, while accounting for death without severe, per-
sistent ADL dependence as a competing event that prevents
the occurrence of our outcome of interest (26­28). Because
the exact event dates were not available, we assumed that they
occurred at the midpoint between the 2 interviews.
In selecting predictors, we initially fitted a model with all
30 predictors in the derivation cohort, using severe, persis-
tent ADL dependence as the outcome, and carried out back-
ward elimination to find a model with the minimal Schwarz
Bayesian Information Criterion (29). Because the propor-
tional hazards assumption was violated for age categories,
we fitted age-stratified Cox models. Categorical variables were
modeled ordinally, if monotonic relationships existed and
likelihood ratio tests favored a more parsimonious model
over the model with indicator terms. Any significant interac-
tion terms among age, sex, and other predictors that resulted
in a lower Bayesian Information Criterion were retained.
Model performance. In the derivation and validation
cohorts, calibration was assessed by calibration plots and the
goodness-of-fit 2 statistic (30). Discrimination was evalu-
ated by C statistics that were modified to the context of com-
peting risk such that individuals who failed from competing
events remained in the risk set at all times (28).
Calculation of risk score. To facilitate clinical applica-
tion, we developed a scoring system by assigning a score to
1086 Kim et al.
Am J Epidemiol. 2013;178(7):1085­1093
each predictor in proportion to its regression coefficient in
our final model. We assessed a potential loss in discrimina-
tion by comparing the C statistic from the risk score with
that from the model. According to the distribution of the risk
score in the derivation cohort, participants were classified
into tertiles of risk score: low (from 0 to 7); moderate (from
8 to 15); and high (16). For each category, we calculated
the observed absolute risk of severe, persistent ADL depen-
dence (event of interest) and death without severe, persistent
ADL dependence (competing event), as well as the risk of
being free of both events in the derivation and validation
cohorts. In secondary analyses, we estimated the 5-year risk
of any or recurrent hospitalizations for selected conditions
(myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, and fracture), using
Poisson regression with log follow-up time as the offset
variable.

Prediction of Severe Disability in Older Adults 1087

RESULTS
At the end of 5 years, 6.8% developed severe, persistent
ADL dependence, and 14.6% died without severe, persistent
ADL dependence in the derivation cohort (n = 8,301). The
corresponding percentages were 6.8% and 15.8% in the vali-
dation cohort (n = 4,177). Loss to follow-up was 2.9% and
2.5%, respectively. Distributions of demographic character-
istics and other predictors were similar in both cohorts
(Table 1).
Model development
In the derivation cohort, most predictors were statistically
significantly associated with severe, persistent ADL depen-
dence, as expected from our large sample size. However, the
model that included 8 predictors achieved the smallest Bayes-
ian Information Criterion (Table 2). Because the model was
stratified by age because of violation of the proportional haz-
ards assumption, the association with age was not directly
estimable from the model. We found that self-rated health was
a stronger predictor of severe, persistent ADL dependence in
younger adults, but less so in older adults (Pinteraction
< 0.001).
Because this interaction term improved the overall model fit
by reducing the Bayesian Information Criterion, it was
included in our final model (Web Table 2). There was no
statistically significant interaction between sex and other pre-
dictors (Pinteraction
> 0.05).
Model performance
To estimate the absolute risk of severe, persistent ADL
dependence, we fitted separate cause-specific Cox models
(Web Table 2) and computed cumulative incidence function.
There was a good agreement between the predicted risk esti-
mated from the cause-specific hazards model and the
observed risk (Figure 1 and Web Figure 1); the goodness-of-
fit 2 statistic = 5.50 (P = 0.79) in the derivation cohort, and
the goodness-of-fit 2 statistic = 3.56 (P = 0.94) in the vali-
dation cohort. However, it was evident that a standard Cox
model that did not consider competing risk overestimated
the risk (Figure 1).
Discrimination was good in younger age and modest in
older age: C statistics were 0.65­0.75 in the derivation
cohort and 0.65­0.72 in the validation cohort (Table 3). By
subgroups, the C statistic was particularly lower in those
who were 80 years.
ADL dependence, death, and hospitalization according
to risk score
We generated an algorithm that assigned scores in propor-
tion to regression coefficients, without a substantial loss in
discrimination compared with the original model (C statis-
tics were 0.64­0.76 in the derivation cohort and 0.66­0.71

in the validation cohort). The age-specific risk tertiles and
corresponding risk of severe, persistent ADL dependence
(Figure 2) are useful in assessing an individual's absolute
risk as well as relative risk compared with others of similar
age. Forexample, aman aged 73 years whose risk score is over
16 has 10.6% risk of developing severe, persistent ADL
dependence in 5 years, which is approximately 3-fold higher
than the risk of an average person of his age and is as high as
that of an average person who is 10 years older.
In order to provide comprehensive prognostic information,
we summarized the 5-year risks of severe, persistent ADL
dependence, death without severe persistent ADL dependence,
and being alive without both events (Table 4). Those in
the upper tertile had higher risks of severe, persistent ADL
dependence, as well as death without severe, persistent ADL
dependence. The risk tertiles also predicted hospitalizations
for myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, and fracture within
5 years in a dose-dependent manner, particularly among
younger subgroups (Web Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
In a representative population of nondisabled, community-
dwelling, older adults, we developed and validated a simple
risk assessment model that predicted the 5-year risk of severe,
persistent ADL dependence using age, 7 self-reported risk
factors, and cognitive function that can be easily obtained in a
general practice setting. This model provides the absolute risks
of severe, persistent ADL dependence and death without ADL
dependence that can be useful in personalized prognostica-
tion and care planning. Although we recognize that the age
of the data set (ADL data collected 20­25 years ago) is a
major limitation for clinical use of our model for contempo-
rary older adults, several features of our approach deserve
mention and enhance future research on prediction of dis-
ability in older adults.
Comparison with existing models that predict disability
Several frailty indices and validated risk assessment models
predict ADL disability in community-dwelling older adults
(Web Table 3). The amount and source of information needed
for risk calculation vary across the models. The frailty index
(31­33), Sarkisian et al. (34), and the Vulnerable Elder
Survey-13 (35, 36) screened a wide range of potential predic-
tors, whereas the Cardiovascular Health Study index (8), the
Study of Osteoporotic Fracture index (37, 38), and the Short
Physical Performance Battery (9, 39) mainly focused on phys-
ical performance with or without other predictors. Although
variations in outcome definitions and health status of study
populations do not allow a direct comparison among these
models, C statistics ranged from 0.64 to 0.76.
Compared with existing models, our model has several
strengths. We estimated the absolute risk of severe, persistent
ADL dependence that is meaningful to clinicians, patients,
and policy makers, in the presence of competing event.
Although disability is a dynamic status, the severity and dura-
tion of ADL disability have rarely been considered in previous
research. In a cohort of community-dwelling older adults,
approximately 80% of the newly disabled recovered indepen-
dence within 12 months, and the recovery rate was lower as
the severity was higher (40). Self-reported dependence was
more closely linked to hospitalizations and resource use than
self-reported difficulty (19). Dependence in 3 ADLs was
associated with an over 3-fold increase in institutionalization
within 2­3 years (18). Thus, our model is likely to capture the
most impaired subgroup of this older population with a greater
likelihood of adverse health events that can affect quality of
life and drive health-care expenditure.
In building our model, we considered multiple biological
and psychosocial risk factors of ADL disability to represent
heterogeneous disabling processes in community-dwelling
older adults. Physical performance (e.g., gait speed) predicts
ADL disability, but it was not measured at the EPESE base-
line. Biomarkers and imaging studies may provide additional
prognostic information with incremental costs. Our objective
was to develop a model based on information that can be easily
obtained without additional resources and costs in a busy prac-
tice setting (e.g., interview and routine physical examination in
a clinic room) for a broader application. Our model showed C
statistics across subgroups that were similar to other resource-
intensive models (Table 3 and Web Table 3).
Potential implications for clinical care
Physicians often feel unsure about when and how to initi-
ate a discussion about advance care planning, particularly

for older adults with multicomorbidities who do not have
a terminal diagnosis nor follow a predictable functional
decline (41, 42). Routine use of a prognostic tool during a
primary care visit can offer an opportunity to discuss prog-
nosis and advance care planning, regardless of the levels of
predicted risk (42). Unlike existing prognostic indices based
on mortality (12), our model provides more comprehensive
prognostic information on the risks of both severe disability
and mortality within 5 years. At the individual level, clini-
cians can use this information to prioritize competing health
issues and reset the goals of preventive care and chronic
disease management. For high-risk adults, the focus should
be minimizing avoidable harms and maintaining quality of
life and function; for low-risk to moderate-risk adults, the
focus should be increasing life expectancy and preventing dis-
ability. Importantly, almost one third of adults aged 80 years
or more are in the low-risk group. They should not be excluded
from preventive care and aggressive chronic disease manage-
ment, based on age alone. At the health-care system level,
practice-based interventions that target these individuals may
reduce hospitalizations and health-care costs.
Limitations
Our study did not examine whether using a risk model
leads to better clinical outcomes. Because our goal was to
predict severe disability that was comparable to nursing

Prediction of Severe Disability in Older Adults 1091

home care, we did not examine individual patterns of ADL
disability or study causal effects of risk factors. Thus, the
effect estimates from our model (Table 2) cannot be inter-
preted as the expected reduction in disability risk with modi-
fication of predictors. Moreover, the discriminatory ability
of our model was lower in older age. In older age, C statistics
from the full model with all 30 predictors were almost the
same as those from our final model, suggesting that addi-
tional self-reported information is unlikely to improve dis-
crimination. Further improvement by physical performance
or biomarkers remains possible. Future studies should exam-
ine an incremental value of physical performance tests or
biomarkers, using our model as a referent model.
There is mixed evidence on how the disability patterns
have changed in older Americans during the past 2 decades
(43, 44). The relations of socioeconomical (e.g., currently
working at a paying job) or biological risk factors (e.g., dia-
betes mellitus or stroke) with disability might have changed
over time. Therefore, recalibration of absolute risk, as well
as validation in a contemporary cohort, is necessary before
widespread application of our model. In addition, hospitali-
zations were self-reported for selected conditions that accounted
for 16% of total hospitalizations among older Americans
in 2009 (45). Finally, the last-observation-carried-forward
method for interval missing data on ADL dependence might
have underestimated the incidence of ADL dependence and
discrimination of our risk model, if those who did not
respond to the interview had worsening disability.
Conclusions
A practical risk assessment tool that uses routinely avail-
able clinical information can predict severe, persistent disabil-
ity that has important implications for quality of life, resource
utilization, and health-care expenditure. Future research should
validate our model in an independent cohort, examine the addi-
tional improvement in prediction by measurements of physical
performance and biomarkers, and evaluate clinical outcomes
of a comprehensive program that incorporates our risk model.
