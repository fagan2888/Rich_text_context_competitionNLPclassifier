Commentary
Tracing You: How transparent surveillance
reveals a desire for visibility
Benjamin Grosser
Abstract
Tracing You is an artwork that presents a website's best attempt to see the world from its visitors' viewpoints. By cross
referencing visitor IP addresses with available online data sources, the work traces each visitor back through the network
to its possible origin. The end of that trace is the closest available image that potentially shows the visitor's physical
environment. Sometimes what this image shows is eerily accurate; other times it is wildly dislocated. This computational
surveillance system thus makes transparent the potential visibility of one's present location on the Earth, while also giving
each site visitor the ability to watch other visitor ``traces'' in real time. By making its surveillance capacity and intention
overt, Tracing You provokes questions about the architecture of networks and how that architecture affects our own
visibility both within and outside of the network. Further, reactions to the work reveal attitudes towards surveillance
post-Snowden, including, in some cases, an angry desire for more visibility than Tracing You currently provides. This
commentary describes how the artwork functions, presents and discusses visitor reactions, and briefly theorizes origins
for these reactions within the contexts of surveillance, sousveillance, and transparency in the age of ubiquitous online
social networks.

Introduction
While many Big Data sources are reserved for exclu-
sive use by their corporate owners and partners, some
are made available for public use. One such source is
the data provided by Google's Maps Service. Vector
maps, street photographs, satellite imagery, and
location metadata can all be obtained from their
Maps API. The author's online artwork Tracing You
(Grosser, 2015) uses this and other data sources to
present a website's best attempt to see the world
from its visitors' viewpoints. This computational
surveillance system thus makes transparent the poten-
tial visibility of one's present location on the Earth,
while also giving each site visitor the ability to watch
other visitor ``traces'' in real time (Figure 1). By
making its surveillance capacity and intention overt,
Tracing You provokes questions about the architecture
of networks and how that architecture affects our
own visibility both within and outside of the network.
Further, reactions to the work reveal attitudes
towards surveillance post-Snowden, including, in
some cases, an angry desire for more visibility than
Tracing You currently provides. This commentary
describes how the artwork functions, presents and dis-
cusses visitor reactions, and briefly theorizes origins
for these reactions within the contexts of surveillance,
veillance, and transparency in the age of ubiquitous
online social networks.

Trying to see where you are right now
As mentioned above, Tracing You presents a website's
best attempt to see the world from its visitors' view-
points. By cross referencing visitor IP addresses with
available online data sources, the system traces each
visitor back through the network to its possible
origin. The end of that trace is an image that potentially
shows the visitor's physical environment.
To obtain the image of a visitor's location Tracing
You asks for no special permissions; it simply references
the same information every user leaves with every web-
site they visit. One piece of that data is the visitor's
Internet Protocol (IP) address. Formatted as a numer-
ical string (e.g. 172.217.5.78), the IP address uniquely
identifies the device used to view the site, whether it
points to one's phone, laptop, or tablet. Every IP
address is registered with the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority, and thus has data associated
with the IP addresses' registration.
Tracing You starts with this IP address and follows
the trail. First it looks up the IP address using ipinfo1 to
obtain geolocation data. This query returns a latitude/
longitude pair (e.g. 48.8631831,2.3629368) that identi-
fies a precise location on the earth. The latitude/longi-
tude is sent to Google in order to query their Street
View, Static Maps, and Javascript Maps data services.
Using these queries, Tracing You searches for the
closest available match it can find, whether it is a
street image in front of the location, an interior image
inside the location, or, if nothing else, a satellite image
from above. Once found, this image is combined with
text information from ipinfo and shown on the Tracing
You interface (Figure 2). The interface shows this image
as one ``tile'' of six--the other tiles representing the five
most recent visitors aside from the current user. As new
users visit the site, tiles are updated to show the new
locations. Others already watching the site see tiles
update as new visitors arrive.
How visible? The (in)accuracy of tracing
location via IP address
The accuracy of the location shown in relation to a
visitor's current location can vary widely. Sometimes
this image is eerily accurate; other times it is wildly
dislocated. For example, Tracing You might show a
photograph taken inside the building the visitor sits
within. Alternatively, the image shown may be a
street photograph from down the block, a few blocks
over, or, in some cases, much further away. When street
view images aren't available, the system resorts to sat-
ellite imagery, showing a several block radius around
the suspected location.
How close the system gets to a visitor's actual loca-
tion depends on how networks are built, configured,
operated, and distributed, which network the visitor's
device uses, and the accuracy of the data associated
with those networks. Further, the ``trace'' may be com-
plicated by a visitor's use of network obfuscation tech-
niques such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or
Tor, both of which hide the user's real location by
encrypting their data and routing their traffic through
proxy networks. Big Data sources such as Google
Maps are regularly updated with new information; in
this way, Big Data's ``picture'' of the world is continu-
ally refined. As that picture becomes more resolved,
Tracing You will become more accurate. As new data
sources are made available, the author intends to inte-
grate them into the artwork.

"Creepy,'' ``Cool,'' and ``BIG FAT FAIL":
Reactions to Tracing You reveal
attitudes towards surveillance
As an artwork, Tracing You has been written about in a
variety of publications such as Le Monde, The Creator's
Project, and Kill Screen, has been exhibited internation-
ally at shows and festivals in Paris, Lisbon, Chicago,
New York, and London, and has been shared widely on
social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. The
resulting public discussion of Tracing You has included
observations of the work through comments, tweets,
and posts. Examining these reactions can reveal current
attitudes towards surveillance.2
Some reactions to Tracing You are easy to predict.
For example, many of those who wrote about the
project expressed concern for what it can do. An
emblematic example of this is a Tweet from user
@paulcarvill: ``this websites [sic] traces you and
shows the closest available image of your current phys-
ical environment. . . BRRRR CREEPY'' (Carvill, 2016)
(Figure 3). In other words, one primary reaction to the
artwork's ability to track and display visitor locations
has been fear. This was expected by the author/artist.
Other reactions were less expected. For example, a
number of visitors expressed happiness about Tracing
You, often manifest as an appreciation of the work's
technical ability to accurately find their location.
Twitter user @jbj called the work ``pretty cool'' and
included his own annotated screenshot showing how
Tracing You had correctly found his location (Jones,
2016) (Figure 4).
The least expected reactions were expressions of
anger. However, these were not expressions of anger
over the artwork's surveillance or intention of locating
its visitors, but instead were expressions of anger over
Tracing You's inability to be more accurate than it
already is (Figure 5).
Facebook user Debbie Beele's comment about
Tracing You, when translated to English by
Facebook, includes the following: ``For me, so a big
fat fail for this art project. It does not do what it prom-
ises'' (Beele, 2016). In other words, Beele feels let down
by what she sees as a disparity between the project's
promise to try and locate her and the results she sees.

This kind of angry response about the work's varying
(in)accuracy was expressed by a number of users across
many sites.
Veillance, transparency, and the
desire for visibility
These visitor reactions to Tracing You provide clues to
understanding user attitudes of surveillance post-
Snowden. Those whose location is most accurately
detected express concern over how easily their current
location can be visualized. One's positionality, based on
race or gender for example, likely plays a role here, as
the risks of being visible are higher for some. But
others, especially those like Beele whose particular net-
work configuration rendered her location less visible,
have expressed anger over the perceived invisibility.
Why might someone be angry about this, in effect
expressing a desire for more accurate surveillance of
themselves?
One answer lies in ``Web 2.0's'' (O'Reilly, 2005)
insistence on radical transparency.3 Social media in
particular has conditioned many to not only accept
high visibility, but to desire it (Bucher, 2012: 1175).
This is because being as visible as possible on sites
like Facebook and Twitter is the key that permits
entry into and full participation within those site's sys-
tems of interaction and connection. Users can lurk or
hide if they choose, but doing so severely limits user
experience. When this desire for visibility intersects
with ubiquitous transparent veillance, it contributes
not only to an acceptance of being seen, but also
helps to produce the negative emotions expressed by
users less visible to surveillance systems. Being less

visible within social networks means having less power;
one's power (to influence opinion, to increase friend
networks, etc.) is dependent on one's visibility.4
As a result, many visitors to Tracing You have
already been conditioned by social networks to
equate visibility with power. Thus, by mirroring the
veillant structures of sites like Facebook, Tracing You
also produces--at least for some of its visitors--a simi-
lar desire for visibility. This happens despite the overt
potentially negative surveillance implications proposed
by Tracing You's ability to reveal one's physical
location.

Summary
Tracing You investigates issues of veillance, transpar-
ency, and Big Data from a practice-based artistic
research perspective. By showing website visitors what
can be gleaned of their current physical environment
based on nothing more than visiting a website, the art-
work provokes its visitors to consider how networks are
built, configured, operated, and distributed, and how
those aspects affect their own visibility to the system.
At the same time, the work puts the viewer into a sous-
veillant position (Mann, 2013: 3), as they are simultan-
eously viewing not only their own ``traces'' but also
those of others around the world. In an age when vari-
ous networks we engage with daily make us more or
less visible to others, Tracing You models these systems
in a way that lets users consider their personal relation-
ship to the network. How susceptible are we to surveil-
lance networks? How much surveillance do we accept,
or even desire in this age of radical transparency? By
helping visitors answer these questions, Tracing You
reveals the emotional landscape that network visibility
cultivates. As Big Data improves its understandings of
the world, Tracing You will further test how veillance
and transparency affects our willingness and desire to
be seen by others.

2. These user reactions were not solicited as part of a formal
study, but were instead observed by the author when
posted on public websites by those who read about and/
or used Tracing You. Thus, no precise metrics are available
regarding response rate or sample size. The reactions
sampled here were selected by the author as representative
examples of more widely seen attitudes from many
sources, including posts on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit,
and Hacker News, as well as comments on publications
and/or made to the author during exhibitions of the work.
3. By ``radical transparency'' I refer to both the ideology
expressed by Mark Zuckerberg and his inner circle at
Facebook towards open sharing (as described in
Kirkpatrick, 2010: 207­211), as well as the form
described by Andrew McStay (2014: 44­48) that ``opens
up both public processes and the private lives of citizens.''

within Facebook.
