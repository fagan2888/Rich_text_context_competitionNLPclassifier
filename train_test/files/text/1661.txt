Abstract
This study tests the specific hypothesis that the 9R/9R genotype in the VNTR of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1)
exerts a general protective effect against a spectrum of risky behaviors in comparison to the 10R/9R and 10R/10R
genotypes, drawing on three-time repeated measures of risky behaviors in adolescence and young adulthood on about 822
non-Hispanic white males from the Add Health study. Our data have established two empirical findings. The first is a
protective main effect in the DAT1 gene against risky behaviors. The second finding is that the protective effect varies over
age, with the effect prominent at ages when a behavior is illegal and the effect largely vanished at ages when the behavior
becomes legal or more socially tolerated. Both the protective main effect and the gene-lifecourse interaction effect are
replicated across a spectrum of most common risky behaviors: delinquency, variety of sexual partners, binge drinking,
drinking quantity, smoking quantity, smoking frequency, marijuana use, cocaine use, other illegal drug use, and seatbelt
non-wearing. We also compared individuals with the protective genotype and individuals without it in terms of age,
physical maturity, verbal IQ, GPA, received popularity, sent popularity, church attendance, two biological parents, and
parental education. These comparisons indicate that the protective effect of DAT1*9R/9R cannot be explained away by
these background characteristics. Our work demonstrates how legal/social contexts can enhance or reduce a genetic effect
on risky behaviors.

Introduction
The objective of this study is twofold: to provide credible
evidence for a protective effect regarding the dopamine trans-
porter gene (DAT1) and to show how the legal and social context
may influence the strength of such an effect. Our first objective is
to test if the 9R/9R genotype in the VNTR of the dopamine
transporter gene (DAT1) has a protective effect against a spectrum
of risky behaviors relative to the 9R/10R or 10R/10R genotype.
Although previous work has examined the links between the DAT1
gene and tobacco and alcohol consumption [1,2], no work has
examined the link with a large number of health behaviors
simultaneously in one single study sample: delinquency (a
collection of criminal behaviors), number of sexual partners, binge
drinking, drinking quantity, smoking quantity, smoking frequency,
marijuana use, cocaine use, other illegal drug use (LSD, PCP,
ecstasy, mushrooms, speed, ice, heroin, or pills), and seatbelt non-
wearing. Our second objective examines whether the strength of
the protection effect interacts with the lifecourse in adolescence
and adulthood in such a way that can be explained by the age-
specific legal status of a behavior.
The Dopamine Transporter Gene (DAT1, locus symbol:
SLC6A3) or the soluble carrier family 6 dopamine transporter
member three gene, codes for a dopamine transporter protein
(DAT), which limits the level and duration of dopamine receptor
activation [3]. Decades of research have accumulated evidence for
the integral role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the
regulation of additive and rewarding behaviors [4] and in memory
and learning [5]. A number of animal studies have demonstrated
that natural rewarding stimuli such as food, drink, and sex increase
the in-vivo release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens [6].
Vanderbergh et al. [7] identified a polymorphic 40-bp variable
number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the DAT1 gene, which is
most commonly observed repeat 9 (DAT1*9R) or 10 times
(DAT1*10R). Although the VNTR is located in a section encoding
the 39 untranslated region and does not change the protein's
amino acid sequence, it has been shown to have functional effects
on gene expression. Please refer to Haddley et al. [8] for an

excellent review on the dopamine transporter gene and addictive
behaviors.
Functional and association studies involving the dopamine
transporter gene is often characterized by inconsistency. For
example, One in-vivo study [9] reported lower levels of DAT1
expression in the striatal putamen for individuals with a
DAT1*9R/10R genotype when compared to those homozygous
for the 10R allele. However, other studies [10,11,12] reported
opposite findings showing that higher levels of striatal DAT1
availability in individuals with one or two 9R alleles. Three
additional in-vivo studies found no effect of the VNTR
polymorphism on DAT1 density [13], protein availability [14] or
function [14].
Quite a number of studies have attempted to link the DAT1
VNTR with addictive or risky behaviors. A 9R allele has been
linked with a lowered risk of smoking addiction [15,16,17]. Studies
on DAT1 and alcoholism mostly failed to demonstrate a link
between the two [18,19]. Many studies of the DAT1 VNTR have
examined ADHD and the findings are inconsistent. Several family
transmission studies showed a higher prevalence in ADHD among
individuals with a 10R allele [20,21,22,23,24,25] while another
study demonstrated an association of the 9R/10R genotype with
more severe symptoms of ADHD in comparison to the 10R/10R
genotype [26]. Still other family-based [27,28] and population-
based studies found no association between the VNTR and
ADHD [27,29]. Conflicting evidence may have arisen from a large
number of factors such as the type of association studies (e.g.,
familial versus population studies), sample size, ethnic variation,
formulation of statistical tests, sample representation, behavior
measurement and statistical controls included.
The issue of consistency is essentially an issue of credibility. The
recent stringent criteria of p-values and replications set for
genome-wide association studies represent a major effort to
establish credibility in genetic association studies. In this article,
we address the issue of credibility by testing the effect of a DAT1
genotype across a spectrum of risky behaviors in a single study
sample. The analysis has, therefore, neutralized the potential
impacts produced by differences in type of studies, sample size,
ethnicity, statistical procedures, sample representation and other
factors and provided robust and consistent findings often lacking in
genetic association studies.
This study tests a specific hypothesis: The 9R/9R genotype in
the VNTR of the dopamine transporter gene exerts a general
protective effect against a spectrum of risky behaviors in
comparison to the 10R/9R and 10R/10R genotypes. The basis
of the specific hypothesis is not only the literature on the DAT1
gene reviewed briefly in this article, but also previously published
work that shows specifically that individuals with the 9R/9R
genotype had a lower level of delinquency [30] and a smaller
number of sexual partners [31] than individuals with the other two
genotypes. The study is designed to test if the protective of effect of
the DAT1 gene can be generalized to other risky behaviors.
The central concern for multiple testing is addressed by three
features of the study. First, the Add Health genetic dataset contains
only a total of five polymorphisms one in each of the five genes,
effectively limiting the number of tests that can be performed.
Second, the study targets specifically at the protective effect of the
9R/9R genotype in the dopamine transporter gene; this particular
hypothesis was generated by previous investigation of delinquency
[30] and number of sexual partners [31] in the same Add Health
dataset. Three, we obtained evidence for the same genetic effect
on a spectrum of most commonly examined risky behaviors.
To test whether the protective effect of the DAT1*9R/9R
genotype can be accounted for by background characteristics, we
also compare individuals carrying the 9R/9R genotype with
individuals carrying the Any10R genotype in terms of age,
physical maturity, verbal IQ, GPA, popularity among peers,
church attendance, family structure, and parental education.
Results
Genetic Main Effects
Table 1 reports behavior and background differences between
individuals with the DAT1*9R/9R and DAT1*Any10R genotypes.
Two sets of results are reported for each behavior trait and each
background characteristic: one set from the sample mean
comparison (2nd and 3rd columns in Table 1) and the second set
from regression analysis (4th column). The sample size for each
genotype is provided in the mean comparison. Table 1 reports the
original form of the regression coefficient for the 9R/9R genotype
when the regression is linear. To facilitate interpretation, we report
the exponentiated regression coefficient (which is odds ratio or
count ratio) when the regression is Poisson, logistic, or ordered
logistic. A verbal interpretation of these main effects is also
provided in Table 1.
The mean-comparison analysis provides initial support for the
hypothesis that individuals with the DAT1*9R/9R genotype are
behaviorally more conservative than individuals with the DA-
T1*Any10R genotype. For every risky behavior we examined, the
mean level of risky behavior among individuals with the 9R/9R
genotype is lower than the level among those with the Any10R
genotype. We illustrate the findings with a number of examples
below. The level of delinquency among the 9R/9R genotype
(0.92) is about one half of that for the Any10R genotype (1.60).
Individuals with the 9R/9R genotype have had an average of 1.49
binge drinking episodes versus 1.88 such episodes for individuals
with the Any10R genotype over the past 12 months. Similarly, the
9R/9R individuals on average used marijuana 1.12 times over the
past 30 days in comparison to 3.06 times by the Any10R
individuals. Also in agreement is the finding for seatbelt-wearing.
The 9R/9R adolescents reported greater seatbelt use (3.22) than
their Any10R counterparts (2.96).
Participants with the 9R/9R genotype, on average, reported
1.18 sexual partners as compared with 2.29 for the Any10R
genotypes. These numbers are averaged over the three Waves at
which the measure was reported. The reported number of sexual
partners is much smaller at Wave I when the study participants
were aged 12­18 than at Wave III when the study participants
were aged 18­26. At Wave III, those with 9R/9R reported 2.94
sexual partners as compared with 5.66 for the Any10R genotype.
The GEE regression analysis confirms the findings from the
mean-comparison analysis. The GEE regression analysis consists
of the main-effect analysis (fourth column in Table 1) and the
gene-lifecourse interaction analysis. All regression models estimate
the effect of 9R/9R and use Any10R as the reference category.
The direction of the 9R/9R effect in all ten main-effect models
(Table 1) is consistent with our hypothesis. Six out of the ten
estimated main effects are statistically significant at the level of
0.05 or lower. Three out of ten are significant at 0.10 and one has
a P-value of 0.14. The lower half of Table 1 presents the estimated
differences between the 9R/9R genotype and the Any10R
genotype in background characteristics. Out of the ten character-
istics, only the verbal IQ differs significantly between the two
genotype groups. The difference is small: on average, the 9R/9R
genotype scores about 2% higher than the Any10R genotype.
Figure 1 plots the main effect of the Any10R genotype relative
to the 9R/9R genotype for the ten risky behaviors. The results for
delinquency and seatbelt usage are based on linear regression. For

these two behaviors, the estimated level of behavior is plotted for
the two genotypes. For example, the levels of delinquency are 1.02
and 1.02+0.58 = 1.60, respectively for the 9R/9R and Any10R
genotypes. The difference between 1.02 and 1.60 is statistically
significant with a P-value of 0.03. For the other eight behaviors,
count ratios are plotted. For instance, Figure 1 plots the ratio of
the count for the Any10R genotype to the count of the 9R/9R
genotype with the count of the 9R/9R genotype set as one. For
example, individuals with the Any10R genotype reported about
72% (1/0.58 = 1.72) more sexual partners than the 9R/9R
genotype, and the associated P-value is 0.0015. The results
concerning the background characteristics are graphed in Figure 2.
Gene-Lifecourse Interaction Effects
Table 2 presents the coefficients and their t statistics of the gene-
lifecourse interaction models for nine risky behaviors. The
interaction model was not estimated for number of sexual partners
because unlike the other behavior measures, number of partners
measures the lifetime cumulative number of partners at each Add
Health Wave and is thus inappropriate for gene-lifecourse analysis.
The main-effect analysis forces the protective effect to be constant
over adolescence and young adulthood, estimating an average
effect over the age range of 13­25. If the protective effect is only
present in a portion of the age range and not in another, averaging
over the effects in both portions may yield an effect which is
weaker, less statistically significant, or statistically non-significant.
Thus, a non-significant main effect does not necessarily indicate an
absence of a protective effect. A gene-lifecourse interaction model
tests if a protective effect is only present in a portion of the age
range of 13­25.
Two discoveries from the interaction analysis (Table 2) are
particularly noticeable and relevant. First, almost all of the main
effects as well as the interaction effects are statistically significant
despite the fact that the interaction analysis costs one additional
parameter. More parameters tend to decrease the level of
significance, but in this case, the additional parameter increases
the overall significance of the model. Second, the four interaction
models involving binge drinking, smoking quantity, smoking
frequency, and seatbelt wearing are highly significant, which
contrasts conspicuously with the four main-effect models involving
the same four outcomes in Table 1. In the main-effect models, the
effect of 9R/9R is either marginally significant (binge drinking,
smoking frequency, and seatbelt wearing) or non-significant
(smoking quantity). The two discoveries suggest presence of a
gene-lifecourse interaction for the protective effect or that the
strength of the protection may indeed depend on age over
adolescence and young adulthood.
To interpret the findings of the interaction analysis, we graph
the protective effect of the DAT1*9R/9R genotype relative to the
DAT1*Any10R genotype as a function of age over adolescence and

measure. The lines stand for the predicted values from regression
analysis in Table 2. The lines in Parts 1 and 9, based on linear
regression, represent the predicted levels of delinquency and
seatbelt wearing, respectively. Parts 2 through 8, based on Passion
regression, present the predicted count of a particular behavior.
For example, Parts 6­8 plot the number of times that study
participants used an illicit drug over the previous 30 days. The
prevalence is reflected by both the level of the lines and the unit on
the vertical axis. For instance, the prevalence rate of marijuana use
is about 10 times as high as cocaine use.
The nine graphs display a small number of patterns of the gene-
lifecourse interaction. For binge drinking, drinking quantity,
smoking quantity, and smoking frequency, the protective effect
of 9R/9R diminishes in young adulthood. In contrast, the
protective effect remains large in both adolescence and young
adulthood for marijuana use and other illegal drugs and increases
sharply for cocaine use. For seatbelt wearing, the protective effect
becomes prominent only after the ages of 17­18. In the next
section, we show that all of these gene-lifecourse interaction
patterns can be explained by a single societal factor.
Discussion
One intriguing insight from this analysis is that all of the
patterns of gene-lifecourse interactions exhibited in Figure 3 can
be explained by one single factor: the age-specific legal status of
the behaviors or the age-specific social tolerance for the behaviors.

The common pattern of lifecourse-gene interaction for binge
drinking, drinking quantity, smoking quantity, and smoking
frequency can be explained by the legal age for alcohol and
smoking. In all of these cases, the protective effect is more
prominent during adolescence when drinking and smoking are
illegal than during young adulthood when drinking and smoking
are becoming legal and more accepted.
The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 required
that all states to raise the legal age for purchase and public
possession of alcohol to 21 and tied this to the highway funds [32].
All 50 states in the U.S. attempt to limit youth access to cigarettes
by banning sales to individuals younger than 18 or 19 years old
[33,34]. In spite of these alcohol and tobacco laws, under-age
drinking and smoking are common in the U.S. [35]. Our empirical
evidence shows that underage drinking and smoking do not
happen randomly. Individuals with the 9R/9R genotype are less
likely to engage in drinking and smoking; however, this protective
effect tends to diminish and disappear when drinking and smoking
are tolerated as these individuals grow from adolescence into
young adulthood. In young adulthood, more legally and socially
tolerated drinking and smoking are not considered as risky as in
adolescence.
The pattern of gene-lifecourse interaction for illicit drug use
(Parts 6­8) can also be explained by the same legal/social factor.
Illegal drugs in this study are measured by three variables:
marijuana, cocaine, and other illegal drugs. These illicit drugs differ from
alcohol and tobacco in at least two important aspects [36]. First,
compared with the age-specific legal restrictions for the possession
and sale of alcohol and tobacco, these drugs are decidedly illegal
and illegal for all ages. Second, the prevalence rates of these drugs
are much lower than alcohol and tobacco. Marijuana is by far the
most commonly used illicit drug in the United States and
worldwide; still, the possession and sale of any quantity of
marijuana is prohibited by federal law in all but twelve states. In
contrast to drinking and smoking, where the protective effect of
9R/9R quickly diminishes beyond adolescence because of legal
and social acceptance of drinking and smoking in young
adulthood, the protective effect of 9R/9R for illicit drug use
continues beyond adolescence because illicit drug use in young
adulthood is no more socially and legally tolerated than in
adolescence.
Seatbelt wearing represents a third pattern of gene-lifecourse
interaction. The much larger protective effect of 9R/9R after the
ages of 15­16 is not accidental; it can be explained by the legal
driving age of 16 in the United States. The legal driving age is
much more observed than the legal age for alcohol and/or
tobacco probably because the access to a car is much harder than
alcohol/tobacco and because the perceived consequences of
driving a car below the legal age are more severe than using
alcohol and tobacco below the legal age. Before the legal driving
age, an adolescent is not driving, and his or her friends are likely
not driving. An adolescent under the legal driving age is much
more likely to be under a supervision of an adult than when he or
she is over 16 when he or she would have much greater freedom to
decide whether to wear a seatbelt, hence the increased protective
effect after age 16.
Delinquency represents a distinct case. The protective effect of
9R/9R against delinquency is most pronounced during the early
and mid adolescence; it declines thereafter (Part 1 in Figure 3).
The delinquency scale is designed to capture a wide range of
serious illegal behaviors that could result in state sanction of arrest,
conviction, and incarceration. That delinquency is illegal at all
ages suggests a constant protective effect across ages. However,
unlike alcohol use, tobacco use, and illicit drug use, which peak in
young adulthood, delinquency reaches the highest level in
adolescence. The sharp decline of delinquency from adolescence
to young adulthood has been observed and documented
universally in different cultures and across historical time [37].
Part 1 in Figure 3 shows that the level of delinquency declines
sharply for both the Any10R genotype and the 9R/9R genotype,
more so for the former than the latter. Our interpretation of the
gene-lifecourse interaction is: The universal and dramatic
reduction in delinquency beyond adolescence is itself an immense
protective factor. The age protection is so large that it renders the
protection of 9R/9R less noteworthy.
In summary, our data have revealed two empirical findings: (1)
A protective effect related to the DAT1 gene against risky
behaviors is consistently found for delinquency, variety of sexual
partners, binge drinking, drinking quantity, smoking quantity,
smoking frequency, marijuana use, cocaine use, other illegal drug
use, and seatbelt non-wearing; and (2) the strength of the
protective effect varies over ages in adolescence and young
adulthood, being strong at the ages when the particular behavior is
illegal and weakening at the ages when the particular behavior
becomes legal or more socially tolerated.
The protective effects exhibit stronger statistical significance in
the gene-lifecourse interaction models than in the main effect
models because the interaction model allows the protective effect
to be more important at some ages than others. The main effect
model forces the protective effect to be constant across all ages in
adolescence and young adulthood. We also examined the question
of whether the individuals in the two genotype groups (9R/9R and
Any10R) systematically differ in age, level of physical maturity,
verbal IQ, grade point average, received popularity, sent
popularity, church attendance, presence of two biological parents
in household, and level of parental education. The two genotype
groups differ only in one of these background traits: The 9R/9R
individuals score about 2% higher on a verbal IQ than the
Any10R ones. The lack of differences in background traits
between the two genotype groups suggests that the protective
effect of 9R/9R cannot be explained away by non-genetic
influences at the individual and familial levels.
These two pieces of empirical evidence suggest the protective
effect as a general effect concerning risk aversion or behavior
conservatism. The evidence does not support the argument that
DAT1 is a gene specifically for craving alcohol or tobacco, an
appetite for sexual partner variety, or a propensity for violence for
three reasons. First, quite different biochemical mechanisms may
be at work for alcohol craving, tobacco addiction, sexual
preference, or violent inclination. A single genetic variant in
DAT1 is unlikely to be responsible for all the biochemical processes
that underlie such a variety of behaviors. Second, the large
majority of white males (94%) belong to the ``higher risk'' group of
the Any10R genotype. Although this group scored higher on all of
the ten risky behavior measures investigated in this study, it is
more appropriate to view this large majority as representative of
the population average. It is the 6% possessing the 9R/9R
genotype that stand out as behavioral conservatives or straight
arrows. Third, the idea of a general protective effect of the 9R/9R
genotype is further strengthened by the findings from the gene-age
interactions. The findings show that the protection of the genotype
is sensitive to a general level of legal tolerance. These findings
generate a further hypothesis that can be tested in future work: It is
beyond adolescence when drinking and smoking become legal that
behaviors such as drinking and smoking be governed more and
more by genes related to specific drug addiction processes.
Dick and colleagues [38] investigated the role of the GABRA2
gene in alcohol and illicit drug dependence across developmental

stages using a COGA-based sample. Our findings appear in
agreement with theirs. In their sample, the gene is associated with
alcohol dependence at ages of 15­20; but this association
diminishes in early 20s. GABRA2 also affects illicit drug
dependence in their sample in both adolescence and later life
stages.
Two goals of genetic association studies are (1) to find credible
evidence linking genetic variations to human traits and (2) to
understand the contexts of such a link. Major headway has been
made recently for the first target via genome-wide association
studies (GWAS). A recent succession of GWAS identified genetic
variants associated with a number of human diseases [e.g.,
39,40,41,42,43]. GWAS aims at discovering effects of novel
genetic variants--effects that are averaged over a large number of
individuals. Understanding the context in which a genetic effect
operates is not a primary target in GWAS.
Our analysis has made significant headway towards both targets
of providing credible evidence and understanding the context of
such an effect for genetic association studies. The credibility of
evidence is established by demonstrating a similar protective effect
across a spectrum of ten risky behavior traits measured on the
same set of individuals. Our work has demonstrated how
information such as lifecourse of risky behaviors could be used
to help illuminate the legal, social, and cultural contexts in which a
genetic effect operates.
A number of limitations should be noted. We were able to
examine only one VNTR in the DAT1 gene. Other variants within
DAT1 or elsewhere that are in LD with the VNTR may be the
causal behavior-influencing variants. The likelihood is high that
some other genetic variants that are not in LD with DAT1 traits
also affect the set of risky health behaviors we have examined. We
are not able to examine CNV and epigenetic variations in this
study. Finally, although we have replicated our basic results across
a large number of risky behaviors, these findings need to be
replicated in other independent datasets.
Methods
Data Source
The data source for our analysis is the DNA sub-sample of
2,500 siblings in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health), which initiated as a nationally representative
sample of about 20,000 adolescents in grades 7­12 from 134
schools in 1994­5 (Wave I) in the United States [44]. The school
sample is stratified by region of the country, ethnic mix, size,
urbanicity (urban/suburban/rural), and school type (public/
private/parochial). Add Health is longitudinal; initial interviews
with respondents were followed by two additional in-home
interviews in 1996 (Wave II) and 2001­2002 (Wave III). Our
analysis uses the sibling sub-sample of Add Health because DNA
measures collected at Wave III in 2001­2002 are available only for
this subset of the respondents. The subset consists of about
2,500 MZ twins, DZ twins, full biological siblings, and singletons.
The present study is based on about 822 Non-Hispanic white
males in Add Health. The sample size varies moderately across
behavior traits and Add Health Waves, depending on the extent of
missing values. This study focuses on males because males and
females often exhibit large differences in the investigated
behaviors. For example, female delinquent and criminal partici-
pation has been shown to be universally and dramatically lower
than that of males [45]. Mice transgenic or knockout studies of
aggressive behavior show that genetic influences are often sex-
specific [46]. The present study focuses on Caucasians and
excludes other ethnicities to reduce the potential impact of
population admixture. The role of a gene can differ sharply across
ethnic/racial groups. In Add Health, other ethnic groups
including Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and Native
Americans jointly account for about 35% of the cohort.
DNA Preparation and Genotyping
At Wave III in 2002, in collaboration with the Institute for
Behavioral Genetics in Boulder, Colorado, Add Health collected,
extracted, and quantified DNA samples from the sibling sub-
sample. Genomic DNA was isolated from buccal cells using a
modification of published methods [47,48,49]. The additional
details on DNA collection and genotyping are provided at the Add
Health website (Smolen and Hewitt, http://www.cpc.unc.edu/
projects/addhealth/).
A 40-bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymor-
phism in the 39 untranslated region of the DAT1 gene has been
genotyped with the modified method used by Vandenbergh et al
(1992). This VNTR ranges from 3 to 11 copies with the 9-repeat
(9R or 440 bp) and 10-repeat (10R or 480 bp) polymorphisms
being the two most common alleles [50]. In the Add Health sibling
sample, the 9R and 10R account for about 21% and 76% of all
alleles, respectively. Our analysis used only individuals with
genotypes of one 10R, two 10Rs, and two 9Rs. The individuals
with other genotypes (about 2%) are excluded from the analysis.
Risky Behaviors
This study examines a spectrum of ten risky behaviors (see
Introduction for a list). The measures of risky behaviors are
intended to capture behavioral patterns rather than accidental,
incidental, or isolated events. For example, for alcohol or tobacco
use, we are interested in the quantity that is used consistently
rather than the timing of the first trial, which can be an isolated
event.
Similar to almost all large-scale human studies, Add Health
relies on self-reports to measure behaviors. To protect confiden-
tiality, reduce non-responses, and increase reporting accuracy, the
interview sections focusing on risky behaviors in Add Health are
self-administered by audio-CASI (Computer Assisted Self Inter-
view). A sensitive question is read to respondents from an
electronic voice and respondents then confidentially enter their
response into a laptop computer. This technique has been shown
to increase response rates and reduce biases when sensitive
questions are involved [51,52,53]. Self reports are now a
fundamental method of behavior measuring and seem capable
of yielding reliable and valid data [54].
Most of the behaviors we investigate are measured repeatedly
on the same study participants across all three Add Health Waves.
The study analyzes all the repeated measures and makes
corresponding statistical adjustments. Table 3 describes each of
the behavior and background variables used in the analysis. The
description provides the variable definition; information on how
the variable is constructed; the sample mean/proportion and its
sample size at each of the three Add Health Waves; and the
sample mean/proportion, standard deviation, and sample size of
the overall Add Health sample that contains all the repeated
measures at Waves I­III. Thus, the sample size of the overall
sample (the last column) should be equal to the sum of the three
samples from Waves I­III.
Delinquency measures delinquent behaviors including violent
behaviors among adolescents and young adults. The construct is
based on 12 questions asked of all the Add Health respondents at
Waves I­III. The questions and scaling weights used to create the
scale can be found in Guo et al. [55]. The delinquency scale is
constructed using information on stealing amounts larger or

physical fighting that resulted in injuries needing medical
treatment, use of weapons to get something from someone,
involvement in physical fighting between groups, shooting or
stabbing someone, deliberately damaging property, and pulling a
knife or gun on someone. Table 3 indicates that 820, 766, and 821
white male adolescents and young adults contribute a measure of
delinquency at Waves I, II, and III, respectively. Our final analysis
file consists of 2,407 person-measures of delinquency. The
delinquency scale is a variation of a widely-used type of scales in
contemporary research on delinquency and criminal behavior
[54].
Number of Sexual Partners is based on the answer to the question of
``With how many partners have you ever had vaginal intercourse,
even if only once?'' The question was repeated at Waves I­III.
Two alcohol-related measures are investigated in this analysis:
binge drinking and drinking quantity. Both are measured three times in
Add Health. Binge drinking is constructed from the question ``Over
the past 12 months, on how many days did you drink five or more
drinks in a row?'' Drinking quantity measures the typical number of
drinks a respondent consumes each time he or she drinks.
Smoking quantity is a measure of number of cigarettes a
respondent smokes on the days he or she smokes. Smoking frequency
records the number of days a respondent smoked cigarettes over
the past 30 days. The three variables of illegal drug use (marijuana,
cocaine, and other illegal drugs) measure the number of times a
respondent has used the drug(s) over the past 30 days. Other illegal
drugs refer to LSD, PCP, ecstasy, mushrooms, speed, ice, heroin,
and/or pills. The two smoking measures and the three measures of
illegal drug use are all collected at Add Health Waves I­III. Seatbelt
wearing is included in the analysis because not wearing a seatbelt
represents a risky behavior. The variable is based on the question
of how often a respondent wears a seatbelt when riding in or
driving a motor vehicle. The question was asked at Add Health
Waves I­II.
Background Characteristics
To provide further evidence that the differences in the ten
behaviors are a result of the variations in the DAT1 VNTR
rather than the differences in other individual and socioeco-
nomic characteristics, we examined the differences in an array of
background characteristics between those with the 9R/9R
genotype and those with the Any10R genotype. The following
section briefly describes the construction of these background
variables. Age is calculated from interview year and month as
well as year and month of birth. To protect participants'
confidentiality, Add Health does not disclose interview day and
birth day of a participant. Physical maturity is from the self-
assessment of physical development compared to other boys of
same age.
Verbal IQ or the Add Health Picture Vocabulary Test (AHPVT) is a
slightly shortened version of the standard Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test [56,57], which is usually considered a verbal
IQ test. GPA, grade point average, is an average of self-reported
grades in English and mathematics. One of the main innovations
of the Add Health study is in the area of social network data
collection. In the in-school study at Wave I, a brief interview was
administered to all students in a school, in which Add Health
participants were asked to nominate up to 5 same-sex and 5
opposite-sex friends starting from the best friend. Popularity received,
or the social prestige of an adolescent, is measured by the number
of times the respondent was nominated by other students in
school. Popularity sent is measured by the number of friends the
respondent nominated.
Church attendance is created from the self-reported frequency at
which a study participant attended religious services in the past 12
months. Presence of two biological parents in the household at the time
of interview is constructed from information on family structure at
each Add Health Wave. Parental education records the higher level of
education of father and mother.
Statistical Methods
Our analytical method consists of two steps: a mean or
proportion comparison and a regression analysis. The mean-
comparison analysis compares the levels of risky behaviors
between the 9R/9R genotype and the Any10R genotype. No
statistical test is carried out in the mean comparison analysis
because standard tests are not valid due to the correlations among
the observations from sibling clustering and repeated measures of
the same individuals at Add Health Waves.

The regression analysis uses generalized estimating equation
(GEE) models to estimate the association between the DAT1
VNTR and risky behaviors [58]. The GEE analysis can be viewed
as a statistically appropriate mean comparison. It addresses the
correlations among the siblings in the dataset, adjusts for age, and
carries out the comparison. GEE models have long been
established in the statistical literature as a standard approach for
addressing correlated data. Our outcome variables for regression
analysis have different statistical distributions. For example, age
and PVT are approximately normal; number of sexual partners is
Poisson; church attendance is an ordered categorical variable, and
presence of two biological parents is binary. All of these outcome
variables can be accommodated readily in the GEE modeling
framework.
The following equation describes the general form of the GEE
model in our analysis:
g(mijt
)~b0

zb2
½9R=9R
ji
, ð1Þ
Where i, j, and t index individual, sibling cluster, and Add
Health Wave, respectively; mijt
~E(yijt
); yijt is an observed risky
behavior or background characteristic; g(mijt

when yijt is a
continuous outcome; g(mijt
)~ log (mijt
) when yijt is a count
variable; and g(mijt
)~ log (mijt
=1{mijt
) when yijt is a binary
outcome variable. The correlation structure in the sample is
addressed by a three-level GEE model with level 1 for Add Health
Wave or repeated measures of the same individual, level 2 for
individuals, and level 3 for sibling clusters.
To test whether the protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype
interacts with lifecourse, we include a gene-age interaction term in
the model

where age is modeled on a logarithm scale for two reasons. Log(age)
can capture a non-linear effect and with one parameter, Log(age) is
more parsimonious than the more usual alternative age and age2.
The gene-lifecourse interaction patterns will be illustrated by
graphing.
Our analysis sample includes only white males, thus eliminating
the concern for population admixture at the level of race/
ethnicity. The white males were drawn from 134 schools across the
US and are representative of all white males in the country.
Missing data were addressed by case-wise deletion rather than
imputation. For example, the number of observations across the
three Add Health waves is not the same (Table 3), that is, not all
individuals were interviewed at all three waves. Our analysis
employed all available observations at all waves without imputing
the missing observations.
Institutional Review Board and Consent of Respondents
The Add Health study was reviewed and approved by the IRB
at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill before each wave
of data collection. In addition, Add Health obtained written
consent at all waves from either the respondent or the parent if the
respondent was under age 18. Regarding the consent for
genotyping, Wave III respondents were informed that ``Your
DNA will be used to learn how closely you are related to your
brother or sister and to study the influence of your genetic makeup
on your mind, body, and behavior. Specimens will be stored for as
long as they are usable and used only for these research purposes.''
