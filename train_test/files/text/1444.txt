BACKGROUND: Dietary quality may impact heart fail-
ure outcomes. However, the current status of the
dietary quality of persons with heart failure has not
been previously reported.
OBJECTIVE: To describe sodium intake, patient factors
associated with sodium intake and overall dietary
quality in a national sample of persons with heart
failure.
DESIGN: Analysis of repeated cross-sectional probabil-
ity sample surveys using data from National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) of 1999­
2000, 2001­2002, 2003­2004 and 2005­2006.
PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 574
persons with self-reported heart failure (mean age=
70 years; 52% women).
MEASUREMENTS: Diet of each survey participant was
assessed using single 24 hour recall. Dietary nutrients
of interest included sodium, the mainstay of heart
failure dietary recommendations, and additionally po-
tassium, calcium, magnesium, fish oils, saturated fat
and fiber. Specific dietary goals were based on estab-
lished guidelines.
RESULTS: Mean sodium intake was 2,719 mg, with
34% consuming less than 2,000 mg per day. Patient
factors associated with greater sodium intake included
male gender, lower education, lower income and no
reported diagnosis of hypertension. Mean potassium
intake was 2,367 mg/day, with no differences by type of
diuretic used or renal disease status. Adherence rates
to established guidelines for other nutrients were 13%
for calcium, 10% for magnesium, 2% for fish oils, 13%
for saturated fat and 4% for fiber.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary quality of persons with self-
reported heart failure was poor. Public health
approaches and clinical dietary interventions are need-
ed for persons with this increasingly prevalent clinical
syndrome.
