Abstract
Studies suggest inverse associations between obesity
and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). However, there is
little evidence whether factors related to obesity,
including lifestyle (diet and physical activity) and
physiologic factors (insulin resistance and metabolic
syndrome), influence PSA. We used dietary, physical
activity, and serum PSA, insulin, glucose, and lipid
data for men >40 years from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2004; N = 2,548).
Energy, fat, and carbohydrate intakes were estimated
from a 24-hour dietary recall. Men were considered
as having metabolic syndrome based on the Adult
Treatment Panel III criteria. Leisure-time physical
activity and doctor-diagnosed hypertension were self-
reported. Body mass index was calculated from mea-
sured weight and height. We computed the geometric
mean PSA (ng/mL), adjusted for age, race, and body
mass index, by tertile of energy, fat, and carbohydrate
intake and level of physical activity, and among men
with and without insulin resistance and metabolic
syndrome in the whole population and by race. The
geometric mean PSA (95% confidence interval) among
men in the lowest tertile of energy was 1.05 (0.97-1.1)
relative to 0.85 (0.8-0.9) in the highest tertile (P = 0.0002)
in the whole population. The PSA concentrations were
lower among overweight men with higher versus lower
energy intake (P = 0.001). The PSA concentrations in
men with insulin resistance was lower [0.87 (0.8-0.9)]
relative to men without insulin resistance [0.98 (0.9-1.1)]
at P = 0.04. All associations were in similar directions
within racial subgroups. No associations were observed
between the other lifestyle and physiologic factors.
Additional studies are required to confirm these results
and to investigate the potential mechanisms that
may explain these relationships. (Cancer Epidemiol

Introduction
Screening for prostate cancer with the use of serum
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations has been
commonplace in the United States. Previous evidence
suggests that obesity, which has reached epidemic
proportions in the United States (1), may be inversely
associated with PSA (2-7), likely due to lower testos-
terone concentrations that influence PSA production
(8-10) and/or the hemodilution of PSA among obese
men (11). However, there is little evidence whether
lifestyle and physiologic factors related to obesity,
including energy, fat, and carbohydrate intake, physical
activity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome,
influence PSA concentrations. One previous large clinical
trial (N = 3,341) evaluated energy, fat, and carbohydrate
intake in relation with PSA concentrations and found no
associations (12). Another study that examined physical
activity in relation to PSA reported null findings (13).
To our knowledge, the associations of PSA with insulin
resistance and metabolic syndrome have not been
examined previously. Although one study, making use
of national data, has reported inverse associations
between diabetes and PSA (14), it must be noted that
not all diabetics are insulin resistant or have metabolic
syndrome.
Because the relationships of PSA, obesity, physical
activity, diet, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome
are complex and not well defined, there is a need to
understand these further. Investigating this area may aid
in the more accurate interpretation of PSA and has
potential implications on prostate cancer screening and
detection in the population. Therefore, making use of a

large national database, we extend the previous obesity-
PSA hypothesis to evaluate whether PSA varies with the
above physiologic and lifestyle factors associated with
obesity among American men. Figure 1 presents our
hypothetical framework for asking these questions.
Materials and Methods
Study Population. We combined data from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 study populations,
two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys
of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the
United States. The details of the procedures involved
in sampling and data collection have been published
elsewhere (15). All procedures were approved by the
National Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review
Board; a written, informed consent was obtained from
all participants.
Of 3,108 men ages >40 y, those who underwent a recent
rectal digital examination in the past week, prostate
biopsy in the past 30 d, cytoscopy in the past 30 d, or
had a history of prostate cancer or current prostate
inflammation (n = 203) were ineligible for PSA testing in
the NHANES and were excluded from this study (16)
because these conditions cause PSA levels to be elevated.
We also excluded those participants for whom there were
no data available for the PSA eligibility criteria (n = 359) or
with missing body mass index (BMI; n = 88), leaving 2,458
men in the analyses data set. These exclusion criteria are
consistent with previously published data from the
NHANES 2001-2004 study population (7).
Exposure Variables. Diet was estimated from the
24-h dietary recall during an in-person interview for both
NHANES study populations. For the study participants
of the NHANES 2003-2004, a second 24-h recall was
done over the phone as a follow-up. However, to ensure
consistency across the two surveys, we assessed the
energy intake for these participants from the in-person
24-h recall. We determined the level of leisure-time
physical activity from the responses to a series of
questions asked in the interview about physical activity
done during the past 30 d. The participants were
considered to be physically active if they mentioned
any leisure-time physical activity. To ascertain whether
the men were vigorously active, they were queried
whether they did any activity that caused heavy
sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate
(e.g., swimming, aerobics, or fast cycling). For moderate
physical activity, the participants were queried whether
they did any activities that caused light sweating or a
moderate increase in the heart rate, such as playing
golf, dancing, bicycling for pleasure, or walking. The
individuals who did not report participating in either
moderate or vigorous physical activity were considered
to be sedentary.
Participant age, race/ethnicity, smoking history, years
of education, and history of doctor-diagnosed medical
conditions, including hypertension, were self-reported
in a structured personal interview (15). Serum PSA,
triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein concentra-
tions were estimated from blood samples collected in the
Mobile Examination Center exam. Fasting plasma glu-
cose and insulin concentrations, measured in a subpop-
ulation of participants >12 y examined in the morning
session after an overnight fast of at least 8 h, were used to
compute insulin resistance through the homeostasis
model assessment algorithm, in which a value of 2.4 or
higher was considered insulin resistant (17). Insulin
concentrations were assayed with different laboratory
methods Pharmacia methods in the NHANES 2001-2002
and Tosoh methods, in the NHANES 2003-2004, and
respectively. Therefore, we used the regression coeffi-
cient [Y (Tosoh) = (1.0027 Â Pharmacia values) À 2.2934]
recommended by the NHANES to make the values
comparable when combining the data from the two
surveys. Weight, height, and waist circumference were
measured in the Mobile Examination Center with the
use of standardized procedures. Based on the Adult

Treatment Panel III (18), metabolic syndrome was
defined as the presence of three of five criteria: (a) waist
circumference >102 cm in men, (b) self-reported physi-
cian-diagnosed hypertension, (c) high fasting glucose
>100 mg/dL or 6.1 mmol/L, (d) hypertriglyceridemia
>150 mg/dL or 1.695 mmol/L, and (e) low high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dL or 1.036 mmol/L in
men. For this study, BMI [weight (kg)/height2 (m)] was
categorized as lean (<25), overweight (25-30), and obese
(>30) per WHO definitions (19).
Statistical Analyses. The serum PSA concentrations
were not normally distributed; therefore, we log-
transformed the PSA. We calculated the percent of total
energy consumed from dietary fats and carbohydrate.
The total energy, percent fat, and carbohydrate intakes
were divided into tertiles, and physical activity was
defined as a dichotomous variable (sedentary/moderate
to intense activity). We computed the geometric mean
PSA by the intake levels of energy, fat, and carbohydrate
and the level of physical activity. We then computed the
geometric mean PSA concentration for two physiologic
factors associated with obesity: status of insulin resis-
tance (dichotomous; yes/no) and metabolic syndrome
(dichotomous; yes/no). We adjusted the geometric mean
PSA concentrations for age, race, and BMI because these
variables were associated with PSA in this sample (7, 20).
Additionally, we included a variable for the survey year
(NHANES 2001-2002 or NHANES 2003-2004) in the
models. P values comparing the PSA for the highest and
lowest tertiles of energy, carbohydrate, and fat intake,
level of physical activity, and PSA among men with
versus without insulin resistance and metabolic syn-
drome were calculated based on two-sample, unequal-
variance t tests with Satterthwaite approximation of
degrees of freedom. Further, for metabolic syndrome, we
explored the association of PSA with the number of
metabolic abnormalities as a continuous variable (with
values ranging from 0 to 5) to investigate whether the
cumulative effect of the biochemical derangements that
are components of metabolic syndrome influence PSA
concentrations. In separate models, we repeated all
analyses for the three racial subgroups (non-Hispanic
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans).
Additionally, we explored the effect of the joint exposure
of BMI categorized as lean (<25), overweight (25-30),
obese (30-35), and very obese (>35) and each lifestyle or
physiologic factor on PSA. Because the results were in a
similar direction for the obese (BMI = 30-35) and very
obese men (BMI = >35), we combined the two groups to
increase power. The NHANES 2001-2004 sample weights
were applied in all the analyses to account for individual
selection probabilities, nonresponse, and poststratifica-
tion that resulted from the complex survey design. All
analyses were done with the use of SAS version 9 (SAS
Institute, Inc.).
Results
Participant Characteristics. Nearly 80% of the study
population was non-Hispanic white, with a median age
of 52 years (Table 1). Three fourths of the population was
either obese or overweight (BMI >25), with the median
BMI being 28. At least half of the participants had PSA
concentrations of 0.9 ng/mL, consumed f2,130 kcal/d,
and reported being either moderately or intensely active.
Further, in the subpopulation in which we were able to
evaluate metabolic syndrome, 41% of the participants
had metabolic syndrome, and about half the population
had insulin resistance.
Associations between PSA and Lifestyle Factors.
Higher energy intake was inversely associated with
PSA concentrations after adjustment for age, race,
and BMI (P = 0.0002). The tertile of dietary fat and
carbohydrate intake (measured as percent energy) and
level of physical activity, either when evaluated in three
categories (sedentary, moderate, and intense; data not
shown) or in two categories (sedentary versus moder-
ately to intensely active) were not associated with PSA
(Table 2). When all the analyses were repeated in racial
subgroups, there was no change in the direction of the
associations within each group (data not shown). The
additional adjustment for the survey year (NHANES
2001-2002 or NHANES 2003-2004) did not change these
associations.
Although the interactions between BMI and the
lifestyle factors were not significant, because BMI is
related with lifestyle, we explored the joint exposure of
BMI and the three lifestyle factors to better understand

their associations with PSA. We observed that, for men
with BMI of 25 to 30, higher versus lower energy intake
was associated with significantly lower PSA concentra-
tions (P = 0.001). The inverse trend of PSA concentration
and energy intake was similar for men with BMI >30
but not statistically significant (Table 3). Differently, the
PSA concentrations were similar across the BMI catego-
ries when evaluated within each level of fat intake,
carbohydrate intake, and physical activity (data not
shown). Further, when these relationships were reeva-
luated separately within each racial subgroup, the
directions of the associations were similar for each race
(data now shown).
Associations between PSA and Physiologic Factors.
The PSA concentrations were determined among people
with and without insulin resistance and metabolic
syndrome (n = 1,200). The PSA concentrations were
lower among men with insulin resistance (P = 0.04) after
adjustment for age, race, and BMI but not among men
with metabolic syndrome. The additional adjustment for
the survey year (NHANES 2001-2002 or NHANES 2003-
2004) did not change these associations. For exploratory
purposes, when we investigated the relation of PSA with
the two physiologic factors within three BMI categories
(<25, 25-30, >30), we noted that the PSA concentrations
did not differ by insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome
(data not shown). Further, when the number of metabolic
abnormalities, treated as a continuous variable, was
evaluated in relation with PSA, we noted no associations
in the whole population (P = 0.12). These relationships
were consistent when evaluated within each racial
subgroup (data not shown).

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to identify physiologic
and lifestyle factors associated with obesity that may
explain in part the previously observed inverse associ-
ations between obesity and PSA (2-7). Werny et al. (7)
reported that PSA concentrations were lower among men
with higher BMI in the NHANES 2001-2004 population.
We now extend these investigations in the same
nationally representative population to evaluate the
association of PSA concentrations with obesity-related
lifestyle factors (diet and physical activity) and physio-
logic factors (metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance).
The data from this large sample of American men who
had not undergone a recent digital rectal examination,
prostate biopsy, or cytoscopy, or had a history of prostate
cancer or prostatic inflammation suggest that higher
energy intake was inversely associated with PSA
concentrations. Furthermore, when we explored the joint
exposure of higher body weight and higher energy
intake, we noted that the PSA concentrations were lower
among men with a BMI of 25 to 30 who reported higher
energy intakes (n = 1,067; P = 0.001), possibly suggesting
that energy and PSA are associated independently of
BMI. A similar association that was not statistically
significant was observed among men with BMI >30
(n = 746; P = 0.09). This specific result, implying that the
PSA levels of obese or overweight men consuming
higher energy may be lower than the actual value, has
potential public health significance because the majority
of American men are overweight or obese (1), as reflected
in this present study sample (median BMI = 28 and waist
size is 102 cm). However, we cannot rule out the
possibility that the inverse association between energy
and PSA among overweight men may be obtained due
to chance. It must be noted that, in this data set, energy
intake was measured through a 24-hour recall and, like
any other dietary assessment tool, this may contribute to
measurement error in the estimation of energy intake.
Therefore, the inverse associations that we note between
energy and PSA concentration in this population may be
attenuated due to the misclassification of energy intake.
Our finding of an inverse association between PSA
and self-reported energy intake differs from the results
of the large Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, a volunteer-
based trial that noted no associations between PSA and
quintile of energy intake estimated from a food frequen-
cy questionnaire in the past year (12).
A plausible explanation for the lower PSA concen-
trations among men with higher energy intakes in this
sample may be due to inverse associations of energy
and testosterone concentrations, which modulate PSA
production in the prostate gland. In laboratory animals,
long-term energy restriction enhanced the production of
serum testosterone compared with rats fed ad libitum,
thereby suggesting that higher energy intake may lower
testosterone concentrations (21). In a small study (n =
36), Fontana et al. (22) reported a nonsignificant
suggestion of lower serum testosterone in men on
typical high-caloric western diets. Further, it has been
shown that PSA gene expression is closely linked with
free testosterone concentrations (23). However, there
may be unidentified alternate biochemical mechanisms
through which higher energy intakes may relate to PSA
concentration.
We also note that men with insulin resistance had
significantly lower PSA concentrations compared with
men without insulin resistance after adjusting for age,
race, and BMI. The underlying mechanisms are unclear
at this time; however, insulin resistance may also be
associated with lower testosterone concentrations (24),
which, in turn, may relate to lower PSA production as
outlined in Fig. 1. When we investigated the PSA
concentrations and insulin resistance within BMI catego-
ries, PSA was not related to insulin resistance. This could
possibly be due to reduced power because insulin
resistance was only estimated in a subsample of the
NHANES participants (n = 1,200). Differently from the
associations observed between insulin resistance and
PSA, we did not find any difference in the PSA
concentrations among men with or without metabolic
syndrome, or the number of metabolic abnormalities
present among these men.
We also observed no associations between PSA and
percent energy from fat or carbohydrate intake and level
of physical activity in this data set. These observations
were consistent with the lack of association between fat
and carbohydrate intake and PSA in the Prostate Cancer
Prevention Trial (12). Similarly, data from two other
prospective dietary intervention trials (25, 26) among
men who were randomized to low-fat, high-fruit, and
high-vegetable diets showed no effect of such diets on
PSA concentrations compared with control diets higher
in fats. Furthermore, consistent with other studies, the
PSA concentrations did not differ with level of physical
activity in this population (12, 13).
Some limitations need to be considered when inter-
preting the results of our study. The NHANES 2001-2004
is a cross-sectional survey that ascertained PSA concen-
trations at the same time as diet, physical activity, and
blood levels. As in all dietary assessment tools used in
nutritional epidemiology studies, there is likely to be the
unavoidable measurement error of dietary energy, fat,
and carbohydrate intake. However, we minimize this
bias in our analyses by drawing conclusions based on the
comparison of extreme groups of energy, fat, and carbo-
hydrate intakes. Despite our analytic strategy, residual
confounding relating to measuring diet imperfectly
or over only short periods of time (24 hours) is likely
to remain so that the associations of dietary intake to
PSA concentrations are likely to reflect this fact, at least
in part.
Although the NHANES anthropometric measure-
ments were standardized and field tested, the BMI may
be subject to random measurement error, biasing results
toward the null. The levels of physical activity in this
data set were self-reported. The lack of association
between physical activity levels and PSA may be due
to the misclassification of physical activity levels.
Further, the level of physical activity was queried for
the past 30 days; therefore, we were unable to determine
the longer-term physical activity level among these
participants. Another limitation of this study is that
there might be about 24% men with undiagnosed
prostate cancer, as suggested by the Prostate Cancer
Prevention Trial study, a large clinical trial (27). Lastly,
there may also be undetected prostate infection and
inflammation in this population. The inability to exclude
men with these conditions might cause the PSA concen-
trations to be higher in our study population.

In conclusion, our findings of inverse associations
between two factors associated with obesity, energy
intake and insulin resistance, and PSA concentrations are
provocative and may have important implications on
prostate cancer detection among American men. PSA is a
common test used to screen for prostate cancer, and
obesity is a public health concern in the United States,
with about 74% to 78% of the men, 40 years or older,
being either overweight or obese (1). These results
suggest that insulin-resistant men and men who are on
higher energy intakes are less likely to have elevated PSA
and may not reach the biopsy threshold. Accordingly,
PSA velocity may be more valuable in identifying
progressive prostate cancer among these men. The
biochemical mechanisms of how higher energy intake
modulates a decrease in PSA production is unclear at this
time, and further studies are required to investigate this
issue. The interrelationships of PSA, obesity, diet, insulin
resistance, and metabolic syndrome require clarity in
other populations, specifically in studies making use of a
prospective design with better measures of diet and
physical activity. The confirmation of these relationships
in additional studies may lead to a more accurate
interpretation of this important screening analyte.
