HIGH TOTAL BLOOD CHOLES-
terol is recognized as a ma-
jor contributing factor for
the initiation and progres-
sion of atherosclerosis.1 The evidence-
based recommendations for manage-
ment of lipid disorders in clinical
practice in the United States are speci-
fied by the National Cholesterol Edu-
cation Program Adult Treatment Panel
III (NCEP ATP III).2 The NCEP ATP
III places a primary focus for choles-
terol management on elevated levels of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C), the major atherogenic lipo-
protein. The guidelines set LDL-C tar-
get levels that are based on the history
of coronary heart disease (CHD) or risk
for developing CHD in the next 10
years.
Several studies using National
Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) data have reported
the prevalence of high LDL-C levels
among persons aged 20 years or older
in the United States.3-7 Most of these
studies focused on people with a high
risk for CHD and on pharmacologic
management of high LDL-C levels.
Results from these studies showed that
a large proportion of adults with high
LDL-C levels, especially those at high
risk for CHD, remain untreated or
inadequately treated despite a steadily
growing use of lipid-lowering medica-
tions. Few studies, however, have
described the prevalence of high
LDL-C levels and the use of lipid-
lowering medications across all CHD
risk categories. Also, studies to date
have not examined health care factors

Context Studies show that a large proportion of adults with high levels of low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remain untreated or undertreated despite grow-
ing use of lipid-lowering medications.
Objective To investigate trends in screening prevalence, use of cholesterol-
lowering medications, and LDL-C levels across 4 study cycles (1999-2000, 2001-
2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006).
Design, Setting, and Participants The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) is a cross-sectional, stratified, multistage probability sample sur-
vey of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population. After we restricted the study
sample to fasting participants aged 20 years or older (n=8018) and excluded preg-
nant women (n=464) and participants with missing data (n=510), our study sample
consisted of 7044 participants.
Main Outcome Measure High LDL-C levels, defined as levels above the
specific goal for each risk category outlined in guidelines from the National
Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III). All pre-
sented results are weighted and age-standardized to 2000 standard population esti-
mates.
Results Prevalence of high LDL-C levels among persons aged 20 years or older
decreased from 31.5% in 1999-2000 to 21.2% in 2005-2006 (P.001 for linear
trend) but varied by risk category. By the 2005-2006 study cycle, prevalence of
high LDL-C was 58.9%, 30.2%, and 11.0% for high-, intermediate-, and low-risk
categories, respectively. Self-reported use of lipid-lowering medications increased
from 8.0% to 13.4% (P.001 for linear trend), but screening rates did not change
significantly, remaining less than 70% (P=.16 for linear trend) during the study
periods.
Conclusions Among the NHANES population aged 20 years or older, the preva-
lence of high LDL-C levels decreased from 1999-2000 to 2005-2006. In the most re-
cent period, the prevalence was 21.2%.

such as inadequate screening, diagno-
sis, and treatment that may contribute
to poor control of high LDL-C levels
at the population level.
The objectives of this study, using
1999-2006 NHANES data, were (1) to
investigate trends in the prevalence of
screening, current use of cholesterol-
lowering medication, and high LDL-C
levels; (2) to evaluate trends in preva-
lence of high LDL-C levels by ATP III
CHD risk category; and (3) to de-
scribe the distribution of participants
who were unscreened, those who were
screened but undiagnosed (ie, they were
not told whether they had high LDL-C
levels), and those participants with high
LDL-C levels who were screened and
diagnosed but untreated or inad-
equately treated.
METHODS
Study Participants
NHANES is a continuous survey of the
health and nutritional status of the US
civilian, noninstitutionalized popula-
tion; samples of participants are se-
lected through a complex, multistage
probability design.8 Each year, approxi-
mately 6000 participants are selected
to participate in the study. Persons who
agree to participate are first inter-
viewed in their homes about their
health, disease history, and diet. After
interviews, qualified participants are in-
vited to a local mobile examination cen-
ter for administration of additional
questionnaires, physical examina-
tions, and laboratory tests.
NHANES data are released in 2-year
increments, and this analysis used data
from the last 4 study cycles: 1999-
2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and
2005-2006. The overall response rate
for completed examinations among all
selected participants for each study
cycle was 76% (9282/12 160), 80%
(10 477/13 156), 76% (9643/12 761),
and 77% (9950/12 862), respectively.
Among study participants invited to
the mobile examination center, a sub-
sample of participants was randomly
selected and asked to fast for 8 or
more hours (up to 24 hours) for labo-
ratory testing (n=13 875). As with
other subsamples in the study, the
fasting subsample has its own desig-
nated weight, which accounts for the
additional probability of selection and
nonresponse. After excluding 5857
participants younger than 20 years,
our study sample consisted of 8018
persons. Women who had a positive
urine pregnancy test or self-reported
to be pregnant (n=464) as well as par-
ticipants with missing lipid profile and
blood pressure data (n=510) were
excluded, leaving analytical samples
for 7044 participants. The study pro-
tocols for 1999-2006 NHANES
received approval from the National
Center for Health Statistics institu-
tional review board and included writ-
ten informed consent.9
CHD Risk Factors and ATP III CHD
Risk Categories
We classified the 7044 remaining study
participants into 3 ATP III CHD risk
categories: high, intermediate, and low
(TABLE 1). Participants with a self-
reported history of CHD, angina, myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, and diabe-
tes mellitus or participants with a fasting
blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL or
greater were placed in the high ATP III
risk category.
Noncoronary forms of atheroscle-
rotic disease (peripheral arterial dis-
ease [PAD] and abdominal aortic an-
eurysm) are also considered a CHD
equivalent in the NCEP ATP III guide-
lines. However, the NHANES exami-
nation includes neither a test for aor-
tic aneurysms nor a history of this
condition or of aortic surgery. Also, we
did not use the ankle-brachial pres-
sure index in our study because this
measure was discontinued in 2005.
However, we determined that the esti-
mated prevalence of PAD calculated by
the ankle-brachial pressure index from
the data for 1999-2004 contributed little
(about 6%-9%) to the overall preva-
lence of CHD or CHD equivalent.
After participants with high risk were
identified, the remaining participants
were assessed according to the num-
ber of major CHD risk factors they had.
These risk factors included cigarette
smoking (self-reported smoking ev-
ery day or some days), hypertension (an
average of 3 blood pressure measure-
ments 140/90 mm Hg, determined by
NHANES physical examination, or self-

bFor persons at high or moderately high risk with lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical inactivity, elevated tri-
glyceride, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], or metabolic syndrome), regardless of LDL-C levels.
cDrug therapy should be sufficient to achieve a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels.
dCHD includes history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stable angina, coronary artery procedures (angioplasty or
bypass surgery), or evidence of clinically significant myocardial ischemia. CHD equivalents include clinical manifestations
of noncoronary forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and carotid ar-
tery disease [transient ischemic attacks or stroke of carotid origin or 50% obstruction of a carotid artery]), diabetes
mellitus, and 2 or more risk factors with 10-year risk for CHD greater than 20%.
eRisk factors include cigarette smoking, hypertension (blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive medi-
cation), low HDL-C level (40 mg/dL), family history of premature CHD (CHD in male first-degree relative younger than
55 years, CHD in female first-degree relative younger than 65 years), and older age (men 45 years or older, women 55
years or older). Electronic 10-year risk calculators are available at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol.
fMost persons with 1 or no risk factor have a 10-year risk less than 10%, indicating that a 10-year risk assessment for such
persons is unnecessary.

sive medication), high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (HDL-C) level less than
40 mg/dL, family history of premature
CHD (angina or heart attack) in a first-
degree relative younger than 50 years,
and older age (men 45 years and
women 55 years). In accord with the
ATP III guidelines,2 if a person had an
HDL-C level of 60 mg/dL or greater, 1
risk factor was subtracted from the per-
son's total number of risk factors. (To
convert total cholesterol, HDL-C, and
LDL-C to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259.)
For participants with 2 or more risk
factors,wecalculateda10-yearCHDrisk

tion, an assessment tool used in the
NCEP.10 Based on categorical values for
age,totalcholesterollevel,systolicblood

tus, points were assigned and then to-
taled to calculate an absolute 10-year
CHD risk for each participant. Those
participants with a 10-year CHD risk
greaterthan20%wereplacedinthehigh
ATP III risk category, and those with
20% or lower risk were placed in the in-
termediate category. Participants with 1
ornomajorCHDriskfactorwereplaced
in the low ATP III risk category with-
outFraminghamscoringbecauseoftheir
low 10-year CHD risk.
Lipid Measurements and
Definition of High LDL-C Levels
We further categorized LDL-C levels ac-
cording to the ATP III risk categories
and goals for therapeutic lifestyle
changes and drug therapy (Table 1).
High LDL-C levels were defined as
LDL-C levels greater than the specific
goal for each risk category. Partici-
pants with high LDL-C levels in-
cluded those eligible for therapeutic life-
style changes or drug therapy.
For all lipid analyses, frozen venous
serum samples were shipped on dry ice
to the Lipoprotein Analytical Labora-
tory at Johns Hopkins University Hos-
pital, Baltimore, Maryland.11 Methods
for determining total cholesterol,
HDL-C, and triglyceride levels for 1999-
2006 NHANES have been described.11
Values for LDL-C were calculated from
measured values of total cholesterol, tri-
glycerides, and HDL-C according to the
Friedewald calculation.11 All lipid mea-
surements were standardized through
the Lipid Standardization Program
maintained by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in collabora-
tion with the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute.12
Assessment and Definition
of Screening Status
Participants were asked whether they
had ever had their blood cholesterol
checked and how long it had been since
their last cholesterol test. Screening was
categorized as those screened during the
last 5 years and told by health profes-
sionals that they had high blood cho-
lesterol, those screened during the last
5 years and not told by health profes-
sionals that they had high blood cho-
lesterol, and those never screened or
screened more than 5 years ago. Cur-
rent use of a cholesterol-lowering drug
was identified by self-reported taking
of prescribed medication to decrease
blood cholesterol levels. Participants
with high LDL-C levels were defined as
unscreened if they were never screened
or not screened during the last 5 years;
undiagnosed if they were screened dur-
ing the last 5 years but never told they
had high blood cholesterol; and un-
treated or inadequately treated if they
had been screened and told they had
high blood cholesterol, but their cho-
lesterol was not controlled.
Data Analysis
Estimated population prevalence and
means with 95% confidence intervals
were calculated using SUDAAN statis-
tical software (Research Triangle In-
ternational, Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina) to account for nonre-
sponse and complex sampling de-
sign.13 The prevalence and means esti-
mates were age-standardized to the
2000 US standard population.14 We
used orthogonal polynomial coeffi-
cients calculated recursively accord-
ing to the method of Fisher and Yates
for linear trend testing.13 Significance
was set at P.05.
RESULTS
The weighted age-standardized esti-
mates of CHD, CHD equivalents, CHD
risk factors, and ATP III risk catego-
ries are presented in TABLE 2 for each
study cycle. No significant changes were
observed in the prevalence of CHD or
CHD equivalents from 1999-2000 to
2005-2006. Among participants with-
out CHD or CHD equivalents, preva-
lences of hypertension and low HDL-C
levels decreased significantly from
15.7% to 10.2% (P.001) and from
19.3% to 9.4% (P.001), respec-
tively. Self-reported use of lipid-
lowering medications increased signifi-
cantly (P.001), but no changes were
observed in the screening rates (P=.16).
Our results assessing the distribu-
tion and trends in the screening groups
among persons with high levels of
LDL-C during the period of study are
reported in TABLE 3. No significant
changes were observed in the weighted
age-standardized screening rates from
1999-2000 to 2005-2006. Among par-
ticipants with high LDL-C levels, 35.5%
were unscreened, 24.9% undiag-
nosed, and 39.6% untreated or inad-
equately treated in 2005-2006. Our
analysis showed that 78.0% of partici-
pants in the high-risk category had total
cholesterol levels of 200 mg/dL or
greater or HDL-C levels less than 40 mg/
dL; thus, according to current guide-
lines, they would be recommended for
further complete lipid profile testing
(data are not shown).
The weighted age-standardized
prevalence of high LDL-C levels among
all participants and among partici-
pants in each ATP III risk category de-
creased significantly during the study
periods (TABLE 4). Overall prevalence
for high LDL-C levels decreased from
31.5% to 21.2% (P.001). However,
this prevalence varied substantially by
risk category. The highest prevalence
of high LDL-C levels was observed in
the high-risk ATP III category with
69.4% and 58.9% during the first and
last cycles, respectively. During the last
study period, the prevalence of high
LDL-C was 30.2% and 11.0% for the in-
termediate- and low-risk categories, re-

about one-fifth of participants were eli-

were not receiving it in 2005-2006.
Among all participants, mean LDL-C
level decreased from 126.1 mg/dL in
1999-2000 to 114.8 mg/dL in 2005-
2006 (P.001). The decrease in mean
LDL-C level was also observed in all risk
categories. The mean LDL-C level de-
creased from 121.2 mg/dL to 109.7
mg/dL (P.001), from 133.2 mg/dL to
113.2 mg/dL (P.001), and from 125.9
mg/dL to 116.9 mg/dL (P.001) in the
high-, intermediate-, and low-risk cat-
egories, respectively.

older decreased by approximately one-
third from 1999-2000 to 2005-2006.
Screening rates for high blood choles-
terol did not change, remaining less
than 70% during the study periods.
The goal of improving screening rates
may be hindered by lack of consensus
regarding the age at which screening
should start. The US Preventive Ser-

College of Physicians­American Soci-
ety of Internal Medicine recommend
initiating high blood cholesterol
screening at age 35 years in healthy
men and at age 45 years in women.15
The NCEP ATP III, convened by the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
tute and the American Heart Associa-
tion, recommends that screening start
at 20 years of age.15 Clinicians play an
additional role in decisions about
screening; the clinician's choice of spe-
cific guidelines is often determined by
the patient's insurance policy.15 Con-
sensus exists among different guide-
lines concerning the need to screen all
adults at high risk for developing CHD
in the next 10 years, including adults
with a history of CHD, vascular dis-
ease, or diabetes.15 However, accord-
ing to our study, one-third of partici-
pants with high LDL-C levels were

unscreened and thus missed an oppor-
tunity to improve their LDL-C levels.
Differences in clinicians' practices,
their awareness of and adherence to
the NCEP ATP III guidelines, and
health care disparity issues16 may con-
tribute to screening rates below the
Healthy People 2010 target of 80% for
adults.17
Using the 2001 NCEP ATP III guide-
lines, we estimated that one-fourth of
participants with high LDL-C levels
were screened but never told about hav-
ing high blood cholesterol by their
clinicians. Several factors may contrib-
ute to this nondiagnosis. Our classifi-
cation was based on the question, "Have
you ever been told by a doctor or other
health professional that your blood cho-
lesterol level was high?" Information
about when the participant was tested
as well as their fasting status and com-
pleteness of the lipid profile is not
available in the NHANES question-
naires. Thus, a deterioration of lipid
profile since the last screening is pos-
sible in some participants but is un-
likely to contribute substantially to our
estimate.
Clinicians' awareness of and adher-
ence to the NCEP ATP III guidelines
probably play a key role. We found that
assessing only total cholesterol and
HDL-C levels instead of taking a com-
plete fasting lipid profile as recom-
mended in the NCEP ATP III guide-
lines would misclassify approximately
22% of participants as having optimal
LDL-C levels when they really would
be in the high-risk category with high
LDL-C levels. In a study of 500 ran-
domly selected US physicians, almost
half failed to classify their patients' risk
levels correctly according to Framing-
ham scores.18 Lack of screening and di-
agnosis can result in inappropriate treat-
ment.
Secondary prevention has been
proven to be cost-effective in reduc-
ing illness and death associated with
CHD.19 However, our study found that
almost two-thirds of participants who
were at high risk for developing CHD
within 10 years and who were eligible
for lipid-lowering drugs were not re-
ceiving medication. Our estimates
would be even higher had we used the
modification of the LDL-C goal for
high-risk patients of less than 70 mg/dL
recommended by the updated 2004
NCEP ATP III report.20 A better under-
standing of factors leading to the non-
diagnosis of high LDL-C levels is
needed. Meanwhile, clinicians' com-
pliance with cardiovascular disease pre-
vention guidelines can be improved
through ongoing education.21
Even when a clinician has opportu-
nities to initiate therapeutic lifestyle
changes (eg, diet, exercise, and weight
control) or drug therapy according to
the NCEP ATP III guidelines, manage-
ment of high LDL-C levels may still be
challenging, especially in high-risk pa-
tients. A recent study using data on
11 552 patients from a health mainte-
nance organization administrative
claims database showed that LDL-C
goal attainment was not achieved
among 61% of patients who received
lipid drug treatment during the first 6
months after an initial diagnosis of CHD
or diabetes.22 Moreover, among those
who continued treatment for high
LDL-C, half of the patients were un-
able to reach their LDL-C goal regard-
less of diagnosis (CHD vs diabetes), sex,
statin titration, lipid-modifying drug
switching, or treatment with a high-
potency dosage of LDL-C­lowering
drug. In a study of therapeutic life-
style interventions that used 24-hour
dietary recall data in 555 patients with
CHD, only a small proportion (5%-
12%) met the recommended consump-
tion of vegetables, fruit, cereal fiber, and
trans-fat intake 1 year after diagnosis
of CHD.23 Two large (about 19 000 par-
ticipants in each) prospective observa-
tional studies found that high baseline
LDL-C values, pretreatment with cer-
tain statins, high glycated hemoglobin
A1c
(HbA1c
) levels in patients with dia-
betes, and high body mass index were
associated with uncontrolled hyperlip-
idemia.24
In our study, during 2005-2006
approximately 2% of participants in
the low-risk category had LDL-C lev-
els appropriate for initiation of drug
therapy, and approximately 9% had
levels appropriate for the initiation of
therapeutic lifestyle changes. How-
ever, use of drug therapy in young
or low-risk adults remains controver-
sial. The combination of low-fat diet,
increased physical activity, and
weight control may decrease choles-
terol levels by 20% to 30% without
drug therapy.2 Results of 2 recent
clinical trials show that a diet low in
saturated fat along with plant sterols
and viscous fibers, soy protein, and
nuts25 or, alternatively, therapeutic
lifestyle changes combined with
ingestion of red yeast rice and fish oil
supplements, may be comparable
with statin use in lipid-lowering
effects.26
The results of this analysis should be
interpreted in light of the following
study limitations. First, the preva-
lence of high LDL-C levels in the US
population may be underestimated be-
cause persons residing in long-term care
facilities are not included in the
NHANES. Second, a misclassification
bias is possible in our study: the pro-
portion of participants in the high-
risk category may be underestimated
due to lack of data on peripheral vas-
cular disease. In addition, the NHANES
question on family history of heart
attack or angina asks about first-
degree relatives younger than 50 years
regardless of sex instead of using
younger than 55 years for men and
younger than 65 years for women,
which are the ages considered to as-
sess family risk factor in the NCEP ATP
III guidelines.2 Thus, some partici-
pants may be placed in the low-risk
group instead of the intermediate- or
high-risk category if the recom-
mended age criteria by sex had been
used. Third, although the collection of
examination and laboratory data was
standardized,self-reporteddatafromin-
terviews and questionnaires may be
subject to misunderstanding and re-
call bias. Finally, although these analy-
ses show a striking decrease in the
prevalence of LDL-C levels over 8 years,
the cause of the decline in LDL-C lev-
els cannot be determined. There were

4 different surveys over the 8-year span,
but each one was a separate cross-
sectional study and precludes deter-
mining causality. In addition, even
though temporal changes in potential
contributing factors, such as improve-
ment in treatment of LDL-C levels, can
be documented, the missing or lim-
ited information on the duration of
treatment, dose titration, and changes
in type of medication used threatens the
validity of such analyses.
In conclusion, among the NHANES
population aged 20 years or older, the
prevalence of high LDL-C levels de-
creased from 1999-2000 to 2005-
2006. In the most recent period, the
prevalence was 21.2%.
