Research Question
During a bank run, policymakers often cite the very real prospect of `information con-
tagion', whereby bad news about one institution precipitates a loss of confidence in the
security of holdings across the banking system, as a key reason for intervention. But,
notwithstanding important progress in developing top-down stress-testing models to help
guide financial stability policy, quantifying the role of information contagion in systemic
risk analysis has proven elusive.
Contribution
We present a model-based stress-testing framework where the solvency risks, funding liq-
uidity risks and market risks of banks are intertwined. The key transmission mechanism
is a two-way interaction between the beliefs of secondary market investors and the coordi-
nation failure between the creditors of financial institutions. Pessimism about macroeco-
nomic fundamentals triggers creditor runs, but also increases the fire sale discount applied
to illiquid assets by secondary market investors. This hampers a troubled bank's recourse
to liquidity and increases the incidence of bank runs, potentially unleashing a wave of
investor pessimism that can drive otherwise solvent banks into illiquidity. We quantify
this contagion channel in the context of the Bank of Canada's model of the Canadian
banking system and a stress-test scenario used by the IMF during its 2013 evaluation of
the Canadian financial sector.
Results
Our results suggest that information contagion can be significant ­ the probability of one
bank entering distress due to contagion alone is nearly 20%, and the extreme tail associ-
ated with the system-wide distribution of bank losses is materially larger. We decompose
the aggregate losses to the banking system into those arising from solvency risk, funding
liquidity risk and information contagion.

Fragestellung
Während eines Bank Runs berufen sich politische Entscheidungsträger oft auf die ,,In-
formationsansteckung" als Grund für eine Intervention. Durch eine ,,Informationsanste-
ckung" führen negative Nachrichten über eine Institution zu einem generellen Vertrau-
ensverlust in die Sicherheit von Anlagen im Bankensystem. Obwohl es in den letzten
Jahren signifikante Fortschritte in der Entwicklung von Top-Down-Stresstest-Modellen
gab, bleibt es weiterhin sehr schwer die Bedeutung der Informationsansteckung im Rah-
men von systemischen Risikoanalysen zu quantifizieren.
Beitrag
Wir präsentieren einen modellbasierten Stresstestrahmen, der Solvenzrisiko, Finanzierungs-
Liquiditätsrisiko und Marktrisiko von Banken miteinander verbindet. Der wichtigste An-
steckungsmechanismus ist eine beideitige Interaktion zwischen den Meinungen sekundärer
Marktinvestoren und dem Koordinationsversagen unter den Gläubiger der Finanzinsititu-
tion. Pessimismus bezüglich der makrökonomischen Grundlagen löst einen Ansturm der
Gläubiger aus, aber vermindert auch den Verkaufswert für schwer zu liquidierende Ak-
tivposten, den die sekundären Marktinvestoren ansetzen. Das beeinträchtigt den Zugang
einer in Schwierigkeiten geratenen Bank zu Liquidität und erhöht die Wahrscheinlichkeit
von Bank Runs, was wiederum den Pessimismus der Investoren weiter verstärken kann, der
eine ansonsten zahlungsfähige Bank in die Zahlungsunfähigkeit treiben kann. Wir quanti-
fizieren diesen Übetragungskanal mit einem Modell des kanadischen Bankensystems, das
die Bank of Canada erstellt hat, und mit einem Stresstestszenario, dass das IMF während
der Bewertung des kanadischen Finanzsektors 2013 eingesetzt hat.
Ergebnisse
Unsere Resultate legen nahe, dass die Informationsansteckung signifikanten Einfluss ha-
ben kann ­ die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Bank, alleine aufgrund der Ansteckung unter
Stress zu geraten, beträgt fast 20 Prozent. Außerdem ist die Wahrscheinlichkeitsmasse im
extremen Ende der Verteilung in einem Modell mit Ansteckung bei einer systemweiten
Verteilung von Bankverlusten deutlich größer als in einem Modell ohne Ansteckung. Des
Weiteren unterteilen wir die gesamten Verluste im Bankensstem in diejenigen, die jeweils
auf Solvenzrisiken, Finanzierungsliquiditätsrisiken und Informationsansteckung zurückzu-
führen sind.

Abstract
We develop an operational model of information contagion and show how it may
be integrated into a mainstream, top-down, stress-testing framework to quantify
systemic risk. The key transmission mechanism is a two-way interaction between
the beliefs of secondary market investors and the coordination failure between the
creditors of financial institutions. Pessimism about macroeconomic fundamentals
triggers creditor runs, but also influences the fire sale discount applied to illiquid
assets by secondary market investors. This hampers a troubled bank's recourse to
liquidity and increases the incidence of bank runs, potentially unleashing a wave
of investor pessimism that can drive otherwise solvent banks into illiquidity. We
quantify this contagion channel in the context of the Bank of Canada's model of
the Canadian banking system and a stress-test scenario used by the IMF during its
2013 evaluation of the Canadian financial sector.

1 Introduction
During a bank run, policymakers often cite the very real prospect of `information con-
tagion', whereby bad news about one institution precipitates a loss of confidence in the
security of holdings across the banking system, as a key reason for intervention. As the
epigraph suggests, such considerations were central during the failure of Northern Rock
in 2007. But, notwithstanding important progress in developing top-down stress-testing
models to help guide financial stability policy, quantifying the role of information conta-
gion in systemic risk analysis has proven elusive.
In this paper, we present a tractable approach to quantifying information contagion
and integrate it into the Bank of Canada's stress-testing model (the Macro-financial Risk
Assessment Framework, or MFRAF). The model is calibrated to representative balance
sheet data for the six largest Canadian banks, and we quantify the information conta-
gion that arises from a stress-test scenario conducted by the IMF as part of its 2013
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Canada. Our results suggest that in-
formation contagion is significant ­ the probability of one major bank entering distress
due to contagion alone is nearly 20% and the extreme tail associated with the system-
wide distribution of bank losses is materially larger. We decompose the aggregate losses
to the banking system into those arising from solvency risk, funding liquidity risk and
information contagion.
The analytical foundation of our approach stems from the global games literature,
which synthesizes the pure panic-based and fundamental-based views of bank runs. Work
in this tradition (Morris and Shin, 2003; Rochet and Vives, 2004; Goldstein and Pauzner,
2005) suggests that poor fundamentals can trigger self-fulfilling beliefs about a financial
crisis. A bank's funding liquidity risk is driven by credit and market losses, funding
composition and maturity profile, and concerns over the bank's future solvency. A cred-
itor receives a noisy signal about their bank's losses, and decides to withdraw based on
expectations over the signals of other creditors.
A bank's market liquidity risk, by contrast, is driven by the perception of secondary
market investors over the macroeconomy. This, in turn, drives the haircut that investors
impose on banks' illiquid assets. When the macroeconomy is in a `bad' state, the haircut is
large, while when the macroeconomy is in a `good' state, the haircut is small. Importantly,
these investors cannot observe the state of the macroeconomy or the losses that banks
suffer. They can, however, observe whether a bank has failed or not, and impute from
this the state of the macroeconomy.
Thus, the coordination failure between a bank's creditors interacts with the views
of secondary market investors. The interaction gives rise to vicious (as well as virtuous)
cycles that can drive otherwise solvent banks into illiquidity. Pessimism about the macroe-
conomy influences the haircut applied to illiquid assets by secondary market investors,
1
hampering a troubled bank's recourse to liquidity. This influences the incidence of bank
runs which, in turn, makes investors more pessimistic and drives down the recourse to
liquidity of other banks in the system.
We demonstrate that for an arbitrary number, N  2, of banks, vicious/virtuous
cycles between investors and creditors end after, at most, N rounds. This result allows
us to operationalize our model, since it ensures that the contagion dynamics will always
converge and terminate after a finite number of iterations. We can, therefore, readily
implement the model within a simulation based stress-test exercise. The result also ensures
that we can quantify the extent of information contagion. Banks that turned illiquid
during the first iteration suffered from liquidity risk. While, banks that turned illiquid
during subsequent iterations did so because of contagion risk.
Our framework is intended as a demonstration of how information contagion can be-
gin to be quantified in stress-testing work. As such, we make a number of simplifying
assumptions. First, we abstract away from network externalities caused by the cascading
defaults of a bank's counterparties. Second, we suppose that the loss distributions are
identical for all banks and, thus, equal to the loss distribution of an `average' bank. Third,
all banks are assumed to have the same Tier 1 capital buffers, liquid assets, and common
returns. Section 4 considers the implications for quantifying information contagion of
relaxing these assumptions.
The paper can be viewed as bridging the gap between the literature on top-down stress-
testing models and the literature on information contagion. Elsinger, Lehar, and Summer
(2006) and Alessandri, Gai, Kapadia, Mora, and Puhr (2009) are early contributions to
the literature on systemic stress-testing. They describe frameworks used by the Austrian
Central Bank and the Bank of England to quantify system-wide bank losses in ways
that explicitly characterize bank balance sheets and allow for macro-credit risk, network
interactions, and fire sale effects. Aikman, Alessandri, Eklund, Gai, Kapadia, Martin,
Mora, Sterne, and Willison (2009) and Gauthier, Souissi, and Liu (2014) demonstrate
how these frameworks might be adapted to quantify funding liquidity risk. But these
analyses eschew any consideration of the information contagion channel considered here.
The literature on information contagion is sizeable, so we only mention some important
recent contributions here. Acharya and Yorulmazer (2008) analyze the ex ante response of
banks to adverse news about other banks. In their two-bank model, information contagion
occurs when bank loan returns have a common systemic risk factor ­ the failure of one bank
conveys adverse information about the common factor. This raises the borrowing costs of
the surviving bank and, in order to maximize the joint probability of survival, both banks
lend and take on correlated investments. Acharya, Gale, and Yorulmazer (2011) present
a model in which the lack of arrival of good news about the value of an asset used as
collateral to roll over short-term debt can be associated with a sudden collapse in the debt
capacity of firms. And Allen, Babus, and Carletti (2012) use a network setting to tackle
the link between commonality in bank asset portfolios and information contagion. With
long-term debt, the asset structure of the banking system does not matter for welfare.
But when debt is short-term and portfolio quality opaque, adverse signals about bank
solvency can trigger foreclosures by creditors. Greater commonality in bank portfolios
increases the likelihood of information contagion.
Recent work by Li and Ma (2013) also considers the same contagion channel that we
do ­ namely an adverse selection problem which results in mutually reinforcing bank runs
2
and fire sales. But while we emphasize the sequential determination of market prices and
failure conditions, Li and Ma derive a simultaneous equilibrium for the pooling price of
assets and the failure conditions. Their focus on regulatory transparency and ex ante
equilibrium asset prices also contrasts with our emphasis on stress-testing and systemic
risk measurement.
Empirical studies of bank contagion typically test whether news of a bank failure
adversely affects other banks using indicators such as stock price reactions and bank risk
premia (Calomiris and Mason, 2003; Hasan and Dwyer, 1994). More recently, Iyer and
Peydro (2011) use evidence from the failure of a large Indian bank to show how direct
contagion can be amplified by information spillovers as banks with higher exposure to the
failed bank suffered larger withdrawals by their depositors.
The paper proceeds as follows. We present the model in Section 2 and discuss the
quantitative application of it in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the implications of
relaxing our simplifying assumptions. A final section concludes.
2 Model
The banking system consists of two banks indexed by b  {1, 2}. We consider a one-year
stress test horizon punctuated by three dates: the start of the year (t = 0), an interim date
at six months (t = 1), and the end of the year (t = 2). The interim date comprises two
rounds. In Round 1, some short-term creditors of a bank have an opportunity to withdraw.
In Round 2, outside investors in the secondary market for banks' risky assets revise their
views on the macroeconomic fundamentals governing the economy. Additionally, short-
term creditors of liquid banks can decide whether to withdraw or rollover their loans.
If funding liquidity risk does not materialize, then the illustrative balance sheet for
bank b at the end of t = 2 resembles Table 1.

LTb Long-term Debt
Liquid assets Mb STb Short-term Debt

Capital
Table 1: Balance sheet of bank b at the end of t = 2
In Table 1, the asset-side of the balance sheet comprises safe and liquid assets (Mb > 0)
carried over from t = 0, as well as risky but illiquid assets. The net value of these risky
assets depends on the investment return Y b and on the credit losses Sb
1
 [0, Sb
1
] and
Sb
2
 [0, Sb
2
], written down at t = 1 and t = 2 respectively. Sb
1
and Sb
2
are drawn i.i.d. from
a probability distribution function fb(S), with cumulative distribution function Fb(S).1
1The assumption that losses at t = 1 and t = 2 are drawn i.i.d from the same distribution simplifies
exposition of the model. Our results continue to hold if different loss distributions for losses are assumed
at t = 1, 2.
3
The liability-side of the balance sheet consists of long-term debt, LTb, that matures
at t = 2, and short-term debt maturing at t = 1, STb, that can be rolled over. Residual
capital after credit loss write-downs is denoted by Eb-Sb
1
-Sb
2
, where Eb is bank b's starting
capital plus income earned over the stress-testing horizon net of dividend payments to
external shareholders. We suppose that each bank has a distinct pool of short-term
creditors. These creditors hold a unit of short-term debt at t = 0 that can be rolled over
during either Round at t = 1. They are also indifferent between consumption at t = 1
and t = 2.
At the interim date, banks have the opportunity to sell risky assets on the secondary
market to a distinct pool of deep-pocketed outside investors who consume at the final date,
t = 2. The price per unit of asset sold depends on the `haircut' on the asset value imposed
by these outsiders. The haircut, in turn, depends on macroeconomic fundamentals which
we represent by the binary variable m  {0, 1}. When macroeconomic fundamentals
are `good', m = 1, and the haircut, hg
 (0, 1), is low. Accordingly, bank b receives
g
 1-hg
 (0, 1) per unit of asset sales. But if macroeconomic fundamentals are `bad',
m = 0, the haircut, hb
 (0, 1) is high and bank b receives b
 1 - hb
< g
for the asset,
implying that hb
> hg
.
We suppose that although the state of the macroeconomy is drawn at t = 0, it is
unobservable to all agents. Moreover, as we discuss in Section 2.1, while creditors de-
cide to rollover after receiving noisy signals about banks' losses, outside investors cannot
observe banks' losses, from which they could have otherwise inferred m. Instead, the
outside investors entertain a common knowledge prior belief, w1
= Prob m = 1 , that
fundamentals are good. The expected price that bank b obtains from selling a unit of the
risky asset to an outside investor is thus
1
 w1
g
+ 1 - w1
b
. (1)
Bank b is insolvent at t = 2 if Sb
1
+ Sb
2
> Eb, i.e. its capital is insufficient to cover its
losses. If Sb
1
> Eb, then it is already insolvent at t = 1. If Sb
1
 Eb, bank b is solvent at
t = 1, but may become illiquid if the fraction of short-term creditors who withdraw (in
either first or second rounds) is too large. In what follows, a bank that is illiquid at t = 1
is assumed to be insolvent at t = 2.
The fraction of short-term creditors who withdraw from bank b during Round 1 of
t = 1 is denoted b
1
 [0, 1]. At the end of Round 1, bank b is either liquid or illiquid ­ a
state that we denote by b
1
 {0, 1}. Thus bank b is illiquid in Round 1 whenever
b
1
> b Sb
1
; 1

Mb + 1
Y b - Sb
1
STb
. (2)
The fraction b Sb
1
; 1
is the ratio of bank b's recourse to liquidity at t = 1 (the sum
of liquid assets plus proceeds from illiquid assets to outside investors) to its short-term
liabilities. If b
1
 b Sb
1
; 1
, then bank b is liquid in Round 1 (b
1
= 0).
Outside investors are able to revise their beliefs about the macroeconomy at the start
of Round 2 of t = 1. Since macroeconomic fundamentals affect banks' credit losses and,
hence, their recourse to liquidity, outside investors can infer the state of the economy by
observing if banks were illiquid or liquid in Round 1. Formally, outside investors determine
w2
 Prob m = 1 | 1
1
, 2
1
and so the new expected price for banks selling risky assets in
4
Round 2 is 2
 w2
g
+ 1 - w2
b
.
If bank b turns illiquid in Round 1, it continues to remain illiquid in Round 2. If,
however, bank b is liquid in Round 1, then it becomes illiquid in Round 2 if the cumulative
outflow of short-term creditors who withdraw in Round 1, b
1
, and Round 2, b
2
, exceeds
its ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities, b Sb

Round 2 provided b

2.1 Withdrawal of short-term creditors
The decision of short-term creditors to withdraw from bank b in Round 1 is assumed to be
independent of their decision to withdraw in Round 2. This assumption implies that the
endogenous fraction of creditors who withdraw in Round 2, b
2
, is independent from the
fraction of creditors who withdraw in Round 1, b
1
, which materially simplifies the analysis.
We model the creditors' decisions in both Rounds by binary-action simultaneous-move
coordination games. Table 3 summarizes the payoffs to an individual creditor during
Round 1. Conditional on the creditor rolling over the claim in Round 1, their payoffs
from withdrawing or rolling over in Round 2 is also summarized in Table 3.
Solvent Insolvent
Rollover 1 + rb 0
Withdraw 1 1
Table 3: Payoffs to a short-term creditor
As Table 3 makes clear, if the creditor withdraws, then the bank returns 1 unit of
funds. The creditor receives this payoff (which is immediately consumed) regardless of
the outcome for the bank.2 But if the creditor rolls over, the payoff depends on the
outcome for bank b at t = 2. If bank b is solvent, then the creditor receives 1 + rb. In the

coordination game.

event of insolvency, however, the creditor receives nothing. Insolvency can arise either
because of a liquidity run at t = 1 or because of excessively large credit shocks.
Conditional on receiving the loss Sb

, bank b becomes insolvent at t = 2 with probability

If Sb
1
> Eb, then the bank is always insolvent at t = 2 for all realizations of Sb

. In this
situation, it is a dominant strategy for all short-term creditors to withdraw in Round 1.
By contrast, when Sb
1
< Eb - Sb
2
, the bank is always solvent at t = 2 and the dominant
strategy for creditors is to roll over during both Rounds. In the intermediate range, the
probability of insolvency is non-zero and ­ with common knowledge over the loss Sb

­ the
model exhibits the well-known multiplicity of equilibria in pure strategies highlighted by
Diamond and Dybvig (1983). `Sunspots' determine whether all creditors withdraw their
claims in Round 1 during t = 1, or no creditor withdraws in any Round. Figure 1 depicts

2.2 Liquidity risk and information contagion
We resolve the multiplicity of equilibria using the global games method pioneered by
Morris and Shin (2003). We allow for the possibility of imperfect common knowledge by
supposing that each short-term creditor, i, of bank b receives a noisy signal xb
id
= Sb
1
+ id
in
each round, d, for realized credit losses. The noise terms for each creditor are independent
across banks and rounds, and id
is uniformly distributed over the interval [- , ].3 All

short-term creditors follow a switching strategy, i.e. there exists xb
d
such that if creditor
i receives a signal xb
id
> xb
d
, then the creditor withdraws in Round d. But if xb
id
 xb
d
,
then creditor i does not withdraw in round d. Creditor i thus uses the signal xb
id
to
infer the distribution of the distribution of signals received by other creditors and thus
the likelihood that they withdraw. The conditions for the unique equilibrium at which
liquidity risk materializes are summarized in Proposition 1 below.
Proposition 1. Critical illiquidity threshold. In the limit of vanishing private noise,
 0, there exists a unique equilibrium in threshold strategies characterized by an illiq-
uidity threshold, Sb
d
, and a signal threshold, xb
d
, for each bank b in Round d. Creditor
i withdraws the claim against bank b in Round d if and only if xb
id
> xb
d
, and bank b is
illiquid if and only if Sb
1
> Sb
d
, where xb
d
 Sb
d
. The illiquidity threshold is implicitly
defined by the indifference condition for the expected payoff to a creditor between rolling
over and withdrawing:
Fb Eb - Sb
d
b Sb
d
; d
=
1
1 + rb
. (3)
The illiquidity threshold is increasing in the bank's equity, Eb, liquid assets, Mb, and
returns, rb, but is decreasing in its short-term debt level, STb. Finally, the threshold is
also increasing in the investor's belief, wd
, and the prices, g
and b
.
Proof. See Appendix A.
The comparative statics for the critical thresholds are intuitive. First, as the bank's
equity, Eb
1
, increases, it has more resources to withstand shocks at the interim and final
dates. The bank's probability of insolvency at t = 2 is lower and, hence, creditors are
more willing to roll over during either Round. Second, as Mb, the level of liquid assets
increases, the bank has greater recourse to liquidity and is better able to satisfy creditors
that choose to withdraw. Creditors, in turn, are more willing to roll over their claims.
Third, as the promised return by the bank, rb, increases, creditors benefit from waiting
until t = 2 instead of withdrawing early during either Round at t = 1 and receiving only
one unit of funds. Fourth, as short-term debt levels, STb, rise, the bank has less recourse
to liquidity to meet withdrawals. This prompts creditors to withdraw earlier. Finally,
increases in investor beliefs in Round d, wd
, and the secondary market prices for risky
assets all improve the bank's recourse to liquidity and encourage roll overs.
Although the results of Proposition 1 hold for both Rounds at t = 1, it is possible for
outside investors' beliefs about macroeconomic fundamentals to change between Round 1
and Round 2. In particular, if outside investors are initially pessimistic about the prospect
of a good state, i.e. w1
is low, this may precipitate liquidity risk in one bank during Round
1. On observing this outcome, investors update their beliefs and become more pessimistic,
w2
< w1
, reducing the second bank's recourse to liquidity in the process.
To formalize these ideas, note that Bayes' rule implies that
w2

Since the circumstance under which bank 1 turns illiquid is independent of those for
bank 2, 1

are independent, and Prob 1

Prob 2

. If bank b turns illiquid in Round 1 (b

on  = g
, outside investors assess the likelihood of such an event to be
Prob b

where the critical threshold Sb
dH
is given by the solution to
Gb Eb - Sb

. (6)
An analogous definition holds for the critical threshold Sb
dL
when the macro-economy is
in a bad state, and the haircuts are large. Propositions 2­4 present the key results of our
model.
Proposition 2. Virtuous liquidity. If both banks are liquid at the end of Round 1,
then w2
> w1
. Consequently, both banks remain liquid at the end of Round 2.
Proof. See Appendix B.
Suppose that, at the start of Round 1, outside investors hold an optimistic view of
macroeconomic fundamentals, i.e. there is a high prior of a good state and w1
is large.
This, in turn, results in both banks remaining liquid at the end of Round 1. At the start
of Round 2, outside investors update their belief upwards since all banks are more likely
to remain liquid, i.e. w2
> w1
. The banks' recourse to liquidity improves which increases
the critical thresholds. Both banks continue to remain liquid and solvent.
Proposition 3. Vicious illiquidity. Suppose bank 1 is liquid and bank 2 is illiquid at
the end of Round 1. The investor become more pessimistic, w2
< w1
, whenever:

If the downward revision of the belief is large enough, then bank 1 will also become illiquid
at the end of Round 2.
Proof. See Appendix C.
Outside investors entering Round 1 with pessimistic views regarding the economy
(low w1
) can render bank 2 illiquid. When updating beliefs at the start of Round 2,
outside investors must compute and compare four different conditional probabilities. If
the inequality in (7) is satisfied, outside investors conclude that it is less likely for bank
1 to remain illiquid when assets are good quality than it is for bank 2 to turn illiquid
when assets are bad quality. The failure of bank 2 has a greater weight in the investor's
Bayesian updating ­ there is a downward revision of beliefs and a more pessimistic view
of asset quality.

To study the consequences for haircuts, we suppose that (i) banks are identical, except
in their reliance on short-term funding, i.e, STb > STb; (ii) small shocks are more likely
than large ones, so that fb = fb = f satisfies f < 0; (iii) the probability that bank b
turns illiquid in Round 1 when macro-fundamentals are good is bounded from above, so
that 1 - G Sb 
1H
< ¯
G, where ¯
G is defined in Appendix D. Under these assumptions, we
obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 4. Price and spread effects. For a given initial belief, w1
, and "bad-state"
price, b
, an increase in the "good-state", g
, increases the price spread,  = g
- b
.
This, in turn, strengthens the pessimism condition and increases the range of parameters
where the investor's belief is revised downwards.
On the other hand, for a given "good-state" price, g
, an increase in the "bad-state"
price, b
, leads to a decrease in the price spread. This weakens the pessimism condition
and reduces the range of parameters where the investor's belief is revised downwards.
Proof. See Appendix D.
As the spread between good and bad state secondary market prices increases, the
probability that bank 1 remains illiquid when assets are bad quality also increases. At
the same time, the probability that bank 2 turns illiquid when asset quality is bad (relative
to the probability that it turns illiquid when asset quality is good) also increases. When
the increase in the relative probability that bank 2 is illiquid is greater than the relative
probability of bank 1 being illiquid, the net effect is to increase the range of parameters
over which the pessimism condition of Proposition 4 holds. The opposite holds when the
price spread decreases.
With updated beliefs, there are two possible outcomes at the end of Round 2: bank
1 remains liquid or turns illiquid. If it remains liquid there is no additional information
for outside investors and their beliefs remain unchanged. But if bank 1 turns illiquid,
investors turn pessimistic. In both cases, there are no further actions possible in further
rounds. Generalizing to an arbitrary number, N, of banks, the following proposition
summarizes the result.
Proposition 5. Convergence. In a game involving N  2 banks, the cycles of Bayesian
updating by investors and withdrawal by creditors terminates after, at most, N rounds.
Proof. See Appendix E.
Proposition 5 has two practical implications for the quantification of contagion risk
in banking systems. First, it ensures that the contagion dynamics will always converge
and terminate after a finite number of iterations. We can, therefore, readily implement
the model within a simulation based stress-test exercise. Second, the result ensures that
we can quantify the extent of information contagion. Banks that turned illiquid during
the first iteration suffered from liquidity risk. While, banks that turned illiquid during
subsequent iterations did so because of contagion risk. The severity of the information
contagion can also be measured in terms of the change in the outside investors' beliefs, i.e.
w = w1
- wd
, where d  N is the iteration where the contagion dynamics terminated.
A large and positive w indicates a significant downward revision of beliefs by outside
9
investors, which greatly hampers secondary market liquidity. By contrast, a small and
positive w implies limited information contagion. and, if w is negative, it implies that
investors are optimistic following the updating of beliefs.
3 Stress testing and simulations
We now integrate the model into the Bank of Canada's Macro-financial Risk Assessment
Framework (MFRAF) and study how an extreme stress scenario for the Canadian economy
might induce information contagion across the banking system. Figure 2 provides a high-
level overview of MFRAF. The stress scenario has a direct impact on corporate and
household defaults, resulting in credit losses for banks and an adverse impact on their
capital buffers. Banks are directly connected to each other via interbank linkages, and
the interbank network clears via the Eisenberg and Noe (2001) algorithm ­ banks repay
their interbank counterparties a sum that is proportional to the original amounts due,
causing counterpart credit losses. Bank balance sheets are thus brought together and
integrated with the interbank network to generate illustrative distributions for system-
wide losses to the banking sector.

Figure 2: Schematic description of the modular structure of MFRAF
Figure 3 illustrates how funding liquidity risk and information contagion are incorpo-
rated into MFRAF. Following an episode of stress, liquidity risk can materialize endoge-
nously as creditors decide whether or not to withdraw based on their perceptions of the
future solvency of the bank (which depends on the severity of losses incurred by year-end
and initial capital) relative to a supervisory threshold. The supervisory threshold is set
at 7% for the ratio of tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets. If the threshold
is breached, creditors withdraw en masse, leading to some banks failing from illiquidity.
Secondary market investors update their beliefs regarding the macro-economy and adjust
the price for banks' risky assets accordingly. This, in turn, influences the withdrawal de-
cisions of creditors for other banks across the banking system. If (pessimistic) perceptions
are widespread, then contagion takes hold in the manner outlined in Section 2.1.
In what follows, we present results which abstract from the interbank network in
order to isolate the influence of the information contagion channel. Section 4 considers
the implications of relaxing this assumption.

3.1 Stress-test scenario
The scenario considered as part of the 2013 FSAP envisages a disorderly default in a
peripheral euro-area country, which results in a banking crisis and recession in the euro
area. The global economy weakens and the ensuing financial market turbulence results
in an adverse shock to the Canadian economy. Specifically, the Canadian economy faces
a large negative foreign demand shock, falling commodity prices, and a loss of business
and consumer confidence, all of which leads to a sharp contraction in domestic demand.
Tighter lending standards and house price declines ensue, generating a persistent recession
more severe than those experienced since the 1980s.
Table 4 describes the scenario and places it in historical perspective. The decline in
the macroeconomic variables is mapped into loan default rates on bank balance sheets,
with different rates being derived for different sectors.4 The average default rate across
sectors is 6.4%, compared with a default rate of 4.4% over the period 1988-2012.
3.2 Calibration
We run MFRAF under a `hybrid' calibration of the 2013 FSAP exercise, taking some
inputs from the banks own bottom-up stress-tests, and others from regulatory filings.
4The domestic sectors include: Accommodations, Agriculture, Construction, Manufacturing, Whole-
sale, Canadian governments, Financial institutions, Small business loans, Residential mortgages (unin-
sured), Home equity lines of credit (uninsured) and Consumer loans.

Table 4: Stress-test scenario and historical comparison
Since much of the data is confidential, we only present aggregate results of the calibration
publicly reported by the IMF in its 2013 FSAP exercise. Table 5 summarizes the data
used along with the sources from which the calibration is based. Banks' balance sheet are
calibrated using data from 2013Q1. The average common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital
ratio is 8.9%.
For the solvency risk module, banks' exposures at default (EAD), mean probabilities
of default (PD) and loss given defaults (LGD) for different economic sectors were taken
from the bottom-up stress-test results. The mean PDs, together with the co-variance
matrix for defaults across sectors are used to generate a sequence of PDs for each bank,
across the different sectors using a Student's t-distribution with 4 degrees of freedom.
Averaging over the realizations, the aggregate expected loss to the banking sector is $35
billion CAD, with a standard deviation of $25 billion CAD.
Banks' balance sheets are calibrated using data from the first quarter of 2013. The
average core equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of banks is 8.9 percent. For the liquidity
risk module, data on banks' liquid and illiquid assets were obtain from the Net Cumulative
Cash Flow (NCCF) returns that all Canadian deposit-taking institutions must submit to
the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) on a monthly basis.5
Liquid assets are those that are unencumbered and eligible for central bank open market
operations. These include, for example, cash and deposit accounts with the Bank of
Canada, government securities (e.g., Canadian, U.S, Euro-area), bankers acceptances and
National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS), which are government
insured.
To derive secondary market haircuts, we begin with a detailed breakdown of banks'

assets into securities and loan portfolios. The securities include: sovereigns, mortgage-
backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate commercial paper, corporate bonds,
equities, precious metals and other commodities. The loans include: residential mortgages
(insured and uninsured), personal loans, credit cards, and business and government loans.
For each of these items, we determine a haircut under normal, or `good' economic con-
ditions and also under stressed, or `bad' conditions. Since transaction-level data was not
available to back out the haircut, our estimates were based on conversations with banks
and other market participants. We subsequently averaged over all loans and securities of
all banks to obtain hg
= 0.7 and hb
= 0.8. Consequently, the per unit prices that banks
obtain for there assets are H
= 0.3 and L
= 0.2, respectively.
Runnable liabilities for banks are obtained by aggregating different funding instru-
ments and maturity profiles. We obtain data on maturing liabilities OSFI. We take into
account international liquidity standards to weight the different funding instruments by
their stability or likelihood to be rolled over. We then use the cumulative stock of debts
coming to maturity within the first six-months of the stress-test horizon to represent the
runnable liabilities in the interim date. On average, these represent 35% of total liabilities
13
across the six banks. Finally, The interest rate that each banks pays to its creditors was
calculated as the banks' weighted average cost of funding.
3.3 Results
For each bank, we compute the probability that its capital falls below the 7% regula-
tory threshold. This probability is calculated by averaging over 100x100 realizations of
the interim and final date solvency shocks for each bank. We subsequently conduct an
attribution analysis to determine the contributions of solvency risk, liquidity risk and in-
formation contagion to this probability. Table 6 summarizes the key findings of the stress
test.
On average, the probability that a bank's capital ratios breaches the regulatory thresh-
old of 7% following the shock is 47%. In a crisis, uncertainty about the assets on a bank's
balance sheet increases and creditors become highly sensitive to a breach of the minimum
capital requirement. A bank that breaches the threshold is deemed to be insolvent for
the purposes of the exercise.6

Table 6: Decomposition of risks
A bank's balance sheet liquidity (BSL) is the ratio of its recourse to liquidity (the sum
of liquid assets and sale of illiquid assets at the initial pooling price) and its liabilities
that are subject to rollover risk.7 Assuming that secondary market investors hold prior
belief w1
= 0.5, the average BSL is ¯
 = 1.08, with three banks (banks 2, 4, 5) having
a BSL ratio greater than one. For moderate shocks, and in the absence of information
contagion, these banks are never illiquid. Whereas banks 1, 3, and 6 turn illiquid with
positive probability, even without information contagion.
6Clearly, the standard criteria of negative net worth entails lower solvency and liquidity risk.
7The BSL measure is different from the LCR and should not be viewed as a proxy for the LCR. The
denominator for the BSL represents liabilities subject to withdrawal at the interim date in the model and
is calculated as all liabilities with a maturity date falling within six months of the start of the exercise.
The LCR, on the other hand, considers cash outflows over a one-month horizon only. The two measures
also differ in their assumptions on the proportion of liabilities that are subject to withdrawal, and on the
haircuts to illiquid assets.
14
When we turn on the information contagion channel, secondary market investors up-
date their belief about the macro-economy following the failure of banks 1, 3, and 6, and
turn pessimistic. This, in turn, reduces bank 4's recourse to liquidity and its BSL ratio
falls below one. The probability that bank 4 is illiquid increases by 19.2%.
The system-wide loss distribution is determined as follows. Insolvent banks losses are
equal to their credit shocks plus a bankruptcy cost, equal to 2.25% of risk-weighted assets.
Banks that fail because of illiquidity suffer an additional bankruptcy cost, equal to the
spread between the initial secondary market price (where w1
= 0.5) and the price offered
by investors after the contagion dynamics play out, multiplied by banks' illiquid assets.
Thus, the losses are proportional to the extent of information contagion.

Figure 4: Aggregate loss distribution
Figure 4 shows how the three types of risk impact on the aggregate loss distribution
(expressed as a percentage of total banking system assets). When only the direct impact
of the stress scenario is considered (the red line called `solvency risk'), maximum system-
wide losses do not exceed 2% of total assets. Average losses amount to less than 0.5%
of total assets. Funding liquidity risk fattens the tail, however (the blue line, called
`liquidity'). The tail of the distribution is fattened even further with the inclusion of
information contagion risk (light blue shaded area) ­ now losses approach 3% of system
assets. Thus, the failure to account for contagion risk can significantly underestimate the
extent of systemic risk. Banks considered liquid in isolation can very easily be rendered
illiquid due to a failure to internalize the system-wide effects of fire sales by pessimistic
agents.
Table 7 presents a second set of simulations in which the stock of runnable liabilities
for banks 2 and 5 are increased such that their BSL ratios are equivalent to bank 4. Banks
2 and 5 continue to withstand liquidity risk in Round 1. But following revisions to priors,
the pooling price falls and their BSL ratios fall below one. This increases the probability
of both banks succumbing to illiquidity due to contagion effects.

Table 7: Decomposition of risks with lower BSLs for banks 2 and 5
We also investigate how changes in the prior belief, w1
, and the price spread g
- l
influence liquidity risk and contagion. The top panel of Figure 5 plots the total probability
of liquidity risk as a function of initial beliefs. As secondary market investors become
optimistic that macro-economy is in a good state, the probability of liquidity risk falls.
The three different curves in the top panel reflect changes to the haircut, hb
, in the bad
state. For the 10% (20%) curve, the haircut is increased by 10% (20%) relative to the
baseline case (the 0% curve). Consequently, the price that investors offer in the bad state,
b
, is reduced by 10% (20%) relative to the baseline. A decrease in the low quality price
increases the price spread and liquidity risk is heightened as a result. The middle panel
of Figure 5 depicts the liquidity risk after the first round of contagion dynamics. As the
prior belief increases, the first-round liquidity risk decreases more rapidly than the total
risk. But, as demonstrated in the bottom panel of Figure 5, the decline in first-round
liquidity risk is supplanted by an increase in contagion risk. When the price spread is
large, the first-round liquidity risk is higher for larger values of the belief. As the belief
continues to increase, the liquidity risk is replaced by contagion risk and total liquidity
risk is unchanged. Figure 5 thus corroborates the theoretical result in Proposition 4.
4 Relaxing the simplifying assumptions
The stress-test results in the previous section were for a banking system wherein all banks
have the same assets and credit losses, but differ in terms of their liability structures.
Moreover, we ignored knock-on credit contagion between banks via the interbank market.
In what follows, we relax these assumptions and investigate their implications for the
stress-testing results.
4.1 Interbank credit contagion
We introduce the interbank contagion effects module described in Figures 2 and 3. As
Gauthier et al. (2014) describe, this module is based on the Eisenberg and Noe (2001)

Figure 5: Decomposition of liquidity risk and contagion
clearing algorithm. Following realizations of t = 1 solvency shocks, runs by short term
creditors and information contagion, and solvency shocks at t = 2, a subset of banks
turn insolvent. Some of these banks may also have obligations to other solvent and
insolvent banks, which cannot be serviced in full. The partial default of insolvent banks
on their claims to solvent banks may, in turn, force the solvent banks into insolvency,
as they cannot service their own interbank obligations in full. The Eisenberg and Noe
(2001) algorithm formalizes this dynamic and calculates an endogenous `clearing-vector'
of payments that banks make to each other, and, thus, estimates the interbank losses.
In addition, we assume that banks that turn insolvent due to network effects suffer a
bankruptcy cost equal to 2.25% of risk-weighted assets.
For our stress-test simulations we use a snap-shot of the Canadian domestic interbank
network from 2013Q1. The data is drawn from the `Interbank and Major Exposure Re-
turn'. This return collects information on exposures between the six Canadian Domestic
Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBS), as well as their total exposures to other financial
institutions, both domestic and foreign (for a certain number of geographical areas), and
their major exposures to key domestic and foreign counterparties. The return is filed on a
monthly basis and contains granular information on interbank exposures across different
instruments, including: secured lending (repos), money market placements (including de-
posits and bankers acceptances), unsecured lending (including contingent lines of credit),
marketable debt and equity securities, and Over­the­Counter derivatives exposures. For
the stress-test, we aggregated exposures across all instruments. The average exposure is
$13 billion CAD.
Figure 6 illustrates the aggregate loss distribution with network effects. We clearly see
a fattening of the tail of the loss distribution. To further investigate the effects, Figure

cumulative loss distribution with network effects and the cumulative distribution without
network effects measures the contribution of interbank network contagion to the aggregate
loss distribution.

4.2 Heterogenous balance-sheets
We finally consider the case where the different banks have different asset portfolios and
loss distributions. To this end, we more fully utilize the granular balance sheet data and
bottom-up stress-test results provided by the banks. Figure 8 reports the aggregate cumu-
lative loss distribution. We note the following. The cumulative probability of obtaining
a loss-to-total-assets ratio of 0.5% with network effects is, roughly, 65%. Compared with
Figure 7, where we assumed a homogenous asset portfolio for banks, the cumulative prob-
ability was only 50%. The influences of information contagion and liquidity risk remain
largely unchanged. The analysis, thus, suggests that, while network effects are less pro-
nounced with heterogenous balance sheets, the results for liquidity risk and information
contagion remain robust.

5 Conclusion
Our paper has proposed a tractable method for capturing information contagion in a top-
down stress-testing framework. The key transmission mechanism is a two-way interaction
between the adverse selection of secondary market investors and the coordination failure
between the creditors of financial institutions. Bank runs emerge endogenously and the
initial beliefs of investors crucially determines the trajectory of systemic stability. We
show, in particular, that pessimism amongst investors can reduce banks' recourse to liq-
uidity, with the inability to fire sell assets readily making them more susceptible to runs.
This, in turn, generates a wave of investor pessimism.
We illustrate how such dynamics play out in a realistic stress-testing exercise, using the
IMF's 2013 FSAP scenario calibrated to Canadian banking data. Information contagion
19
is shown to be potentially significant in this context, notwithstanding the simplifying
assumptions used.
Systemic financial crises are invariably associated with large-scale information con-
tagion. A proper understanding and quantification of the channels through which such
contagion spreads is crucial for effective systemic-risk management. Our model represents
a small first step towards an operational framework for dealing with this most challenging
issue.

A Proof of Proposition 1
We establish the existence of a unique Bayesian equilibrium for each bank, b, in threshold
strategies. Morris and Shin (2003) show that only threshold strategies survive the iterated
deletion of strictly dominated strategies.
Each creditor, i of bank b uses a threshold strategy, xb
id
is round d, whereby debt
is rolled over if and only if the private signal suggests that the credit shock is small,
xb
id

. Hence, for a given realization of the shock Sb

E Proof of Proposition 5
Base case: In the case N = 2 at the end of Round 1, either both banks have turned
illiquid, only one bank has turned illiquid or both remain liquid. In the first case, investors
update their beliefs and become pessimistic, but there are no further actions to take. In
the third case, Proposition 2 implies that investors become optimistic when they update
their beliefs, and no banks suffer from illiquidity. Finally, if only one bank defaults, then
investors may become more pessimistic when they update their beliefs. In the worst case,
this will lead to the second bank turning illiquid in Round 2, after which there are no
further actions, and the game terminates.
Induction Hypothesis: In the case of N > 2 banks, the game terminates after, at
most, N Rounds.
Inductive Step: In the case of N + 1 banks, suppose that at the end of N Rounds,
there are N + 1 - k banks liquid and k banks illiquid, where k  N + 1. If k = N + 1,
then all banks are illiquid, and the game ends. If k = N, then for the lone liquid bank, in
round N + 1, investors update their beliefs and post a new pooling price. The creditors
of the bank subsequently decide whether or not to withdraw. If they do not withdraw,
then the bank remains liquid, and there is no further information to be gained for the
investors, and the game terminates. If, however, they all withdraw, then the bank turns
illiquid. While investors update their beliefs, there are no further actions to take and,
hence, the game also terminates. For k < N, it follows that in round N + 1 - k there
were no new banks turning illiquid, and, hence, beliefs did not update, implying that the
game terminated.
