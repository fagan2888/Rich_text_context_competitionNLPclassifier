Background. Disability questions require older people to report difficulties with everyday activities, using broad categorical
responses. Relatively little is known about population group differences in the thresholds for reporting difficulty or inability
with medium-distance mobility against tested mobility-related performance. We aimed to estimate the thresholds on tested
performance at which self-reports change from one category to another, across a range of sociodemographic subgroups. We
also aimed to compare reported and tested performance across two national population studies.
Methods. The samples were from the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES III) and the
Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Measures of gait speed, chair stands, and peak expiratory flow rate in both
studies yielded the validated index of mobility-related physical limitations (MOBLI). Latent probit models were used to
estimate cutpoints (thresholds) on the index for reporting difficulty or inability to walk a medium distance.
Results. Thresholds for reporting difficulty or inability were studied by age, sex, race, educational level, and income in
NHANES III. In models adjusting for the other factors, performance thresholds for reporting disability categories varied by
age and income. The younger elderly persons in NHANES III on average reported difficulties or inabilities only when they
reached a more severe level of tested limitation compared with older old persons. A similar pattern exists for those on higher
incomes. For race, differences in threshold were present only for reporting inability, but not difficulty. Significant differences
in thresholds were not present between groups defined by sex or for years of education. Comparisons between the NHANES
and LASA studies show that lower reported mobility difficulty or inability prevalence in the Dutch sample is attributable
both to reporting at higher levels of limitation and to better functioning.
Conclusions. There is evidence of differences in thresholds for reporting mobility disability, especially across age and
income groups in older Americans. Further work is needed to understand the perceptual, attitudinal, or environmental
factors that cause these reporting differences.
AS THE population ages, accurate monitoring of the
health of older people grows more important. Older
people typically suffer from several diseases simulta-
neously, and therefore disability, reflecting the impact and
severity of these diseases, provides an important focus for
aging research. Disability is a risk factor for dependence,
institutionalization, and health care utilization (1).
Questions on disability require respondents to report levels
of difficulty (e.g., none, some, much, or unable) without
indicating when these terms should be used. The categorical
responses identify groups with functional decline due, most
commonly, to arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive
impairment (2). However, the environment also influences
difficulty with everyday tasks: Older people faced with high
ambient temperatures or upward slopes, for example, may
report difficulty walking a quarter of a mile at relatively less
severe levels of physical health problems than those facing
normal temperatures or flat ground. In addition, attitudes
toward reporting difficulty might also influence responses,
with differing thresholds for admitting difficulty. The net
result of these factors is so-called ``response category
cutpoint shifts'' for self-reported health status (3).
One way of conceptualizing the response categories to
disability questions is to see them as resulting from
a mapping process onto a continuous measure of relevant
aspects of physical health. The transition from reporting ``no
difficulty'' to ``difficulty'' occurs at a cutpoint or threshold
on the underlying physical health status measure. If cutpoints
differ systematically across populations, or even across
sociodemographic groups within a population, then the
disability reports are not comparable. A striking example of
shifted thresholds is from Kerala State in India, which has the
lowest mortality and illiteracy rates but consistently has the
highest self-reported morbidity rates (4). For disability
studies, recent analyses by the World Health Organization
have also confirmed that different subpopulations have
significantly different attitudes toward reporting disabilities,
including mobility disability (5,6).
We have recently reported the development of the index of
mobility-related limitations (MOBLI) (7) for epidemiologic
use comparing the physical component of mobility disability
across populations or over time. In logistic regression models,
three measures were identified as being most strongly as-
sociated with reported difficulty or inability in walking a
medium distance(aquarterofamile) inthethirdU.S.National
Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES III): gait
speed, time to complete five chair stands, and peak expiratory
flow rate. We have since shown that the MOBLI is predictive
of mortality over 4 years in the U.S. Established Populations
for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly Study (8).

MOBLI also had good sensitivity and specificity in the
Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) and was
responsivetochangeovertwo 3-year periodsof follow-up(9).
The MOBLI is thus well suited as a measure of
``mobility-related physical health'' for studying response
shifts. In this analysis, we aimed to estimate the thresholds
on tested performance at which self-reports change from one
category to another, across a range of sociodemographic
subgroups. We also aimed to compare reported and tested
performance across two national population studies.
METHODS
Study Sample
The NHANES III was a cross-sectional study of the U.S.
population, undertaken between 1988 and 1994 (10,11).
Complex clustered samples of the civilian, noninstitution-
alized populations were used. Of 6596 persons aged 60 or
over interviewed in their homes, a total of 5724 took the
further examinations (5302 attended the mobile examination
center, and 422 were examined in their own houses because
they were unable to attend the center). One hundred ninety-
three persons whose self-reported walking information was
not available were excluded, and the remaining 5531 were
included in this analysis. Data sets used in this analysis were
from the Public Use Data File (12).
LASA includes a representative sample of The Nether-
lands (13­15). In brief, it is a longitudinal study of predictors
and consequences of changes in well-being and autonomy
in the older population. Thus far, the LASA study has
conducted three cycles of interviews and performance tests,
approximately 3 years apart. From September 1992 to
September 1993, 3107 persons participated in the LASA
baseline interview. To be comparable with the NHANES III
data set, respondents aged 60 or over, living in the
community, with measured and self-reported mobility
information were included in the analysis. A total of 2115
respondents were eligible for this analysis.
Measurement of Variables
MOBLI.--The MOBLI included measured average gait
speed, time to complete five chair stands, and peak
expiratory flow rate (6). The MOBLI is the calculated
overall (whole NHANES III population) probability of
reporting difficulty (or inability) in walking a quarter mile,
based on the logistic regression models including the three
measures. The MOBLI score varies from 0 to 1: The higher
the score, the higher the probability of mobility-related
limitation and of reporting medium-distance walking
difficulty or inability. (Details of the MOBLI equations
and calculation of scores are available online [16].)
Self-reported mobility disability.--In NHANES III, the
question on difficulty in walking a quarter mile had four
response categories: without, some, much, and unable to do.
In this analysis we dichotomized responses into (1) ``any
difficulty'' versus none or (2) ``inability'' versus ability.
In LASA pilot studies (17), questions on ``walking 400
meters'' and ``walking for 5 minutes'' were asked. Walking
for 5 minutes at a normal pace (5 km/h) is equivalent to
walking 400 meters or a quarter of a mile, and the questions
gave similar results. Ultimately, the ``walking for 5 minutes''
question was chosen for LASA, as conveying a clearer
concept to respondents.
Sociodemographic variables that separate subgroups.--
Sociodemographic variables in this analysis include sex,
age, race, and income and educational level. Levels of
income were classified by the poverty income ratio (on the
midpoint of observed family income category as the
numerator and the poverty threshold, the age of the family
reference person, and the calendar year in which the family
was interviewed as the denominator). Tertiles of the
weighted whole poverty income ratio distribution were
used to classify people's income as low (0.025­1.708),
middle (1.709­3.239), or high (!3.240). Levels of educa-
tion were based on the number of completed years of
education, coded as low (0­7 years), middle (8­11 years), or
high (!12 years). Those not answering questions on
educational or income level were coded as missing.
Statistical Analysis
Latent probit model.--Statistically, we assume there is
a latent variable representing an individual's relevant
physiologic status. With the use of this, we can estimate
and compare difficulty or inability thresholds (cutpoints) on
this scale. In this analysis, the latent variable is measured
using the MOBLI index. To estimate the difficulty or inability
cutpoints, we used the Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed
Models (GLLAMM) Program, developed by Rabe-Hesketh
and colleagues for use in STATA (18,19). In our model, the
binary response yi
of person i to the self-reported mobility
question is modeled using a probit model with underlying
response yi
*. The latent variable can be described by the
measured mobility level of person i. That is, we assume yi
* ;
N(li
,1) and li
¼xi
b, where xi
is the MOBLI score and b is its
associated coefficient. The observed responses yi
(0: no
difficulty or no inability; or 1: with difficulty or with inability)
are generated assuming a threshold (response category
cutpoint) model with person-specific thresholds (response
category cutpoint) si
. That is, yi
¼0 if yi
* , si
and yi
¼1 if yi
*
! si
. The ith person-specific threshold (response category
cutpoint) si
is a linear combination of covariates (zi
,
individual-level sociodemographic characteristics) and can
be expressed as si
¼ zi
9c, where c is the coefficient vector
associated with zi
and is estimated by maximum likelihood,
assuming responses are independent across individuals. In
this cutpoint model, the covariates include age, sex, race,
educational level, income level, and national study.
To understand individual effects and the overall adjusted
effect of each variable on people's threshold for reporting
disability, we built latent probit models for each variable
separately and then together. In each model, the first
subgroup of the variable was fixed as the baseline category
and the estimated coefficient and standard errors for other
subgroups were calculated. The level of statistical signifi-
cance was set at p , .01.
In the analyses based on each variable, the underlying
mobility function measure was rescaled from 0 to 1, where
0 corresponds to the lowest level of functional limitation (i.e.,
1296 MELZER ET AL.
no functional limitation) and 1 corresponds to the highest
level of functional limitation. The estimated difficulty or
inability cutpoints were also appropriately rescaled to lie
between 0 and 1. The 95% confidence intervals for these
rescaled cutpoints were also calculated.
RESULTS
Comparisons of Cutpoints for Different Subgroups
in the NHANES III Study
In the NHANES III sample (Table 1), the proportions of
male and female are nearly equal. Most of the sample were
aged 60­69 (41.7%) and were White (59%). One-third
(34.4%) reported having difficulties in walking a quarter of
a mile, and about one-third of them (706/1901) were unable
to do it.
Table 2 presents the coefficients and standard errors of the
subgroups in each variable in the latent probit model. Males
and females do not have significantly different cutpoints in
reporting difficulty or inability in walking. White people do
have different cutpoints from other groups for reporting
inability but not difficulty. Subgroups by age, income level,
and educational level have significant differences in
cutpoints for both difficulty and inability. For age and
income level, there is a clear gradient for cutpoints, with
younger ages and higher income levels having higher
cutpoints. The direction of the educational level effect is not
clear for either difficulty or inability cutpoints.
The latent probit model coefficients of the subgroups in
each variable (Table 2, Figure 1) show a clear gradient
relationship of cutpoints for subgroups of age and income
level, although differences in difficulty cutpoints between
age groups 70­79 and 80 or over (p ¼ .1482), between
middle- and high-income groups (p¼.0369), and in inability
cutpoints between low- and middle-income groups (p¼.062)
were not statistically significant. Again, no obvious differ-
ences between difficulty or inability cutpoints can be seen by
sex. For race, White Americans had relatively low inability
cutpoints compared with others. By education, the subgroup
of 12 years and over had significantly higher difficulty
cutpoints only compared with the subgroup of 8­11 years
(p , .001), which had significantly lower inability cut-
points than the other two subgroups.
We further put all covariates together in the models to
see the independent effect of each variable on the cut-
points (Table 3). Compared with the results in the single-
effect models, age and income level remained important
independent predictors for both difficulty and inability
cutpoints, and race was significant only for inability
cutpoints. However, educational level was not statistically
significant in the overall model.
Comparisonsof Cutpoints Between U.S. and DutchStudies
The NHANES and LASA age and sex structures (Table
4) were similar. However, the study sample from The
Netherlands had much less impairment of mobility function
measured either by self-report or by physiologic tests (peak
expiratory flow, five chair stands, average walking speed,
and MOBLI scores) compared with the U.S. sample.
With use of the latent probit models, the difficulty
and inability cutpoints for each study were calculated
and plotted in Figure 2. The LASA sample had relatively
higher cutpoints (all p , .001 in difficulty and inability) than
the U.S. sample; that is, the threshold for reporting difficulty
or inability was at a more severe level of tested impairment.
These differences remained (all p , .001 in difficulty and
inability) even if only the White participants (n¼3,263 in the
United States and 2,102 in The Netherlands) were included

used. These categorical responses can be seen as a subjective
mapping onto an underlying ``latent'' measure of mobility-
related physical health. In this analysis, we have shown that
there are important variations in thresholds (cutpoints) for
reporting disability categories across different sociodemo-
graphic subgroups and studies. In the U.S. NHANES III
study, against a validated measure of mobility-related
impairments or limitations (the MOBLI), groups defined by
age and income level have significantly different thresholds
for reporting disability categories. In addition, comparing

THRESHOLDS FOR MOBILITY DISABILITY BETWEEN STUDIES
self-reports in the U.S. study and the LASA sample from The
Netherlands suggests that the very large differences in
reported mobility disability are, in fact, substantially smaller
when differences in thresholds for reporting disability are
accounted for in this cross-study comparison.
In similar analyses of the NHANES III data set, Iburg and
colleagues (5) compared self- and physician reports with
a latent variable based on eight available physical tests,
namely, shoulder external rotation--right and left, hip and
knee flexion--right and left, timed 8-ft walk, timed tandem
stand, and five timed chair stands. The analysis assumed that
this latent variable represented an individual's true mobility
level. That analysis similarly showed that thresholds for
reporting difficulties occurred at more severe levels of tested
impairment in men compared with women, in non-White
respondents compared with White respondents, and in those
on higher incomes compared with those on lower incomes.
Two limitations of this earlier work have been addressed in
our analyses: namely, the use of an unvalidated statistical
latent variable in contrast to our use of the MOBLI and the
analysis of age and educational level in addition to sex, race,
and income level as grouping variables. A key difference
between the Iburg latent variable and the MOBLI score is
that the latter included expiratory flow rate, which was

empirically found to be more closely associated with
medium-distance mobility than the upper-extremity and
balance tests. In addition, Iburg and colleagues (5) did not
explore cross-study comparisons.
NHANES Analyses
A number of limitations in this analysis need to be
considered in assessing the results. First, the NHANES III
study included community-living older people only. One
common hurdle in analyzing performance test data is
missing data, but here we have used the MOBLI, which
includes ``missing'' as a category in score calculation. In
addition, ``missing'' categories were included for grouping
variables. The use of the latent probit model, although less
familiar, is conceptually very similar to logistic regression
models: In logistic regression, group differences are
measured by relative odds, whereas in probit models,
thresholds are reported. The traditional probit model is
widely used in calculation of doses required to achieve
target effects (20,21). The use of this statistical technique
should therefore not be problematic.
Our analyses also have a number of strengths. The
NHANES III study is a high-quality national study with
a relatively large sample of older people, combining self-
report and tested performance relevant to medium-distance
mobility. Our use of the MOBLI score as a continuous
measure of the physical component of mobility disability
provides a strong foundation for the analysis, given the
construct validity of the MOBLI, plus the evidence for its
good test characteristics, predictive validity, and sensitivity
to change.
The results of the analysis of NHANES III are clear-cut:
Thresholds for reporting disability categories vary by age
and income level when compared with tested performance
in models adjusted for the other studied factors. Thus,
younger elderly individuals on average report difficulties or
inabilities only when they reach a more severe level of
tested impairment compared with older old individuals. A
similar pattern exists for higher income level. At the same
time, significant differences were not present between
groups defined by sex or for the main categories of
educational level. For race, differences in threshold were
present only for reporting ``inability'' but not difficulty.
This analysis is also relevant to understanding causes of
disability. For sex, it is well documented that women have
both higher disability prevalence and incidence rates than
men (22,23), even after controlling for age (24), and worse
measured mobility function (25). Our results have shown
that after adjusting for measured mobility function (the
``physiologic'' component of mobility disability), women
and men report disability with the same thresholds. The sex
difference in disability rate appears, therefore, to reflect
physiologic differences. The lack of significant threshold
differences by educational level similarly suggests that the

THRESHOLDS FOR MOBILITY DISABILITY BETWEEN STUDIES
higher prevalence of mobility disability in less educated
groups (26­28) reflects real physical health differences (25).
Clearly, the mechanism for reporting disability across
different age or income groups is somewhat different. With
advancing age, self-reported disability and measured func-
tional limitations both become more common. In our analysis,
the younger old subjects were shown to be relatively less
likely to report mobility disabilities than the older old subjects
with similar measured physical health status. Possible
explanations for this finding include differences in attitudes
toward reporting or differences in environment. How pre-
cisely attitudes toward disability reporting are formed in
different age groups and cohorts needs to be further explored.
Evidence from some studies has shown that older people
with higher income level have both better self-reported
(27,28) and measured (25) physical function. Differences in
reporting of disability across income groups evident in our
analysis may perhaps arise from real differences in the help
and facilities available to older people with higher incomes,
or it may reflect only differences in attitudes. Again, further
research is needed.
It is interesting that White Americans are more likely than
non-Whites to report inability. However, results from
previous studies about racial differences in self-reported
disability are inconsistent (29,30). The possible directions of
racial differences are still unclear, especially if socioeco-
nomic status differences are accounted for in analyses (31).
Cross-Study Comparison
Comparing studies of older people is seldom easy, as
detailed differences in design and instruments abound.
Although the measures used in both the LASA and the
NHANES III studies are very similar, there are some
differences that could make comparison across these two
studies difficult to interpret. First, the comparable question on
walking a quarter of a mile in LASA related to ``walking for
five minutes,'' which was designed to cover roughly the same
medium-distance walk but was found to convey a clearer
concept to Dutch respondents. Reported prevalence rates in
the LASA study for mobility disability were far lower than
those in the U.S. study, and these differences could be
dismissed as uninterpretable because of the differences in the
disability question asked. However, recent evidence from
another cross-country study, when all questions were
standardized, also suggests that Dutch people have a lower
prevalence of self-reported disability than do people in other
countries (32).
By using the MOBLI score in both studies, we can assess
whether part of this difference in reported disability is due to
differences in reporting, and we can also assess how much
of the difference in mobility-related performance remains to
be explained. Our analyses show that the thresholds for
reporting difficulty and inability in the LASA study were
indeed substantially different from those in the U.S. study,
with Dutch respondents reporting disability only at more
severe levels of tested performance. Nevertheless, differ-
ences in MOBLI score and in performance on the individual
tests are also present.
Clearly, much more work has to be done to understand
why differences in reporting of disability exist between some
groups but not others in comparison with measured physical
performance. Important differences in, for example, home
and outside environment may play important roles and need
further exploration. In any event, the analyses presented
support the case for the use of relevant and validated test-
based measures in epidemiologic studies of the causes of the
physical health component of disability.

Conclusion
Traditional disability questions require older people to
report difficulties with everyday activities including mobil-
ity, using broad and largely undefined categories. The core
component of disability is physiologic. When it is measured
by a valid continuous measure of mobility-related physical
impairment or limitation and is compared with disability,
there is evidence of differences in thresholds for reporting
mobility disability across age and income groups in
older Americans. Furthermore, comparisons between the
NHANES III and LASA studies suggest that both reporting
thresholds and measured impairment or limitation contribute
to reported differences in medium-distance mobility dis-
ability. Further work is needed to understand the causes of
attitude or environmental factors that may contribute to
these reporting differences.
