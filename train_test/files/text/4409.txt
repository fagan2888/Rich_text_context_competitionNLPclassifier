Since the existence of organization, organizational knowledge has been managed more
informally than in formal ways. This was done through a knowledge supporting culture,
by trusting and managing the employees. This was possible due to the small size of the
organizations and co-location of employees. However, increasing global competition
and growth of marketplaces have created a competitive incentive among many compa-
nies to consolidate and reconcile their knowledge assets as a means of creating value
that is sustainable over time. In such a scenario, a need was felt to formally manage
knowledge by developing capabilities.
The objective of this research article is to explore the knowledge management (KM)
capabilities in large Indian organizations and their impact on knowledge effectiveness.
It is based on the premise that together the perspectives of KM infrastructure and KM
processes provide a useful theoretical foundation for defining important aspects of
knowledge effectiveness in organizations. Knowledge management capabilities are
explored with respect to infrastructure, structure, and culture. Knowledge management
processes comprise creation/acquisition, storage, dissemination, and application. This
research has found evidence that large Indian organizations have started realizing
the importance of managing knowledge as a strategic asset. However, the approach
is different in different organizations. Some organizations rely more on creating
knowledge infrastructure capabilities through culture and structure while others
equally emphasize the need of process approach to manage both tacit and explicit
knowledge within the organization. KM effectiveness is defined in terms of improved
communication, enhanced collaboration, improved employee skills, better decision-
making, and improved productivity.
Data collected from 156 organizations was subject to structural equation modelling. The
results established that both infrastructure capabilities and process capabilities play an
important role in improving KM effectiveness.

Summary
422 IMPACT OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS
One of the most dramatic evolutions in the
businessoverthepastdecadehasbeenthedawn
of the new economy, that is, the knowledge-
based economy. The increasing global competition
and growth of marketplaces has created a competitive
incentive among many companies to consolidate and
reconcile their knowledge assets as a means of creating
value that is sustainable over time. Recent studies
(Moon & Lee, 2014) have concluded that culture and
knowledge-sharing processes contribute to knowledge
management (KM) effectiveness. Business organizations
view knowledge as their most valuable and strategic
resourceforachievingsustainablecompetitiveadvantage
(Davenport & Prusak, 2000). Thus, organizations
have initiated knowledge management (KM) projects
and programmes and have also emphasized on the
knowledge-sharing aspects (Wang, Noe, & Wang, 2014).
The organizations have started to recognize, create,
transform, and distribute knowledge and have a KM
system in place (Gold, Malhotra, & Segars, 2001).
The primary focus of many organizations has been to
develop new applications of information technology
(IT) to support the digital capture, storage, retrieval, and
distribution of organization's explicitly documented
knowledge (North & Kumta, 2014). Other organizations
believe that most important knowledge is tacit
knowledge which can be shared by creating a culture
in the organization. It has also been observed that KM
is not just about capturing, storing, and transferring
information; the pattern of interaction between
people, technologies, and techniques is also important
(Bhatt, 2001). The impact of KM has been studied on
performance and knowledge effectiveness in developed
nations; however, how the developing nations are
building these capabilities has not been studied. This
motivated the researchers to take up the study of KM
capabilities and their impact in Indian organizations.
AkeytounderstandthesuccessandfailureofKMwithin
organizations is the identification and assessment
of capabilities for successful KM effectiveness and
organizational performance. In this study, therefore,
the research questions are:
Which KM capabilities would impact knowledge
effectiveness in the organizations?
Which capability is more critical in impacting
knowledge effectiveness: knowledge infrastructure
capabilities or knowledge process capabilities?
CONCEPTUAL MODEL
Knowledge Management Capabilities
Tocompeteeffectively,firmsmustleveragetheirexisting
knowledge and create new knowledge that favourably
positions them in their chosen markets. In order to
accomplish this, firms must develop an `absorptive
capacity'--the ability to use prior knowledge to
recognize the value of new information, assimilate it,
and apply it to create new knowledge and capabilities.
Gold et al. (2001) have developed a model of KM based
on the capabilities perspective. They refer to three key
infrastructure capabilities--technical, structural, and
cultural--that enable the maximization of social capital
(intangible capital).
In order to leverage infrastructure, KM processes
must also be present in order to store, transform, and
transport knowledge throughout the organization
(Almeida, 1996; Appleyard, 1996; Barnard & Spencer,
1996; Grant & Baden-Fuller, 1995; Nonaka & Konno,
1998; Porter, 1996; Szulanski, 1996). These processes
enable the organization to capture, reconcile, and
transfer knowledge in an efficient manner. Together, the
perspectives of infrastructure and processes provide a
useful theoretical foundation for defining important
aspects of knowledge effectiveness in organizations
(Figure 1).
Infrastructure Capabilities
Information Technology
According to Gold et al. (2001), technology comprises
a crucial element of the structural dimension needed
to mobilize social capital for the creation of new
knowledge. `Technology is able to overcome the
barriers of time and space that would otherwise be
limiting factors in KM activities. It also serves as a
repository in which knowledge can be reliably stored
and efficiently retrieved' (Chua, 2004). The entire
technology infrastructure used in Organizational
Knowledge Management Systems (OKMS) is tangible
and it acts as an enabler for facilitating KM initiatives
in the organizations.
According to Meso and Smith (2000), technology
infrastructure comprises the hardware, software,
middleware, and protocols that allow for the encoding
and electronic exchange of knowledge. Four types of
technology infrastructure are found in an OKMS:

1. Knowledge-oriented technologies, such as groupware
and web browsers that directly process knowledge
work and facilitate sharing of knowledge within
the organization.
2. Function-oriented technologies, such as office
automation, robotics, and desktop computing
technologies support operational level activities
such as data processing, production, and service
delivery while collecting the data.
3. Specialty oriented technologies support highly
specialized functions within the firm and usually
require high levels of know-how. Examples of these
technologies include computer-aided design and
manufacture (CAD/CAM) software, and expert
systems software (Davenport, De Long, & Beers,
1998; Hibbard, 1997).
4. Social networking technologies supported through Web
2.0 is seen as a major facilitator of collaboration and
information dissemination in an organization (Nieves
& Ososrio, 2013; Panahi, Watson, & Partridge, 2013).
Technology infrastructure provides the base or plat-
form upon which KM solutions are built. It consists of
the repositories for unstructured data (document and
content management) and structured data (data ware-
housing, generation, and management). Groupware is
also a part of infrastructure as it supports the collabora-
tion needed for knowledge sharing (Duffy, 2001).
According to Yeh, Lai, and Ho (2006), IT that supports
and coordinates KM are: databases, knowledge
platforms, performance evaluation management
system, and integrated performance support system.
Zack (1999) believes that IT plays four different roles
in KM: (a) obtaining knowledge; (b) defining, storing,
categorizing, indexing, and linking knowledge-related
digital items; (c) seeking and identifying related
contents; and (d) flexibly expressing the content based
on the various utilization backgrounds.
The technology-centred OKMS today are employing
one technology or a combination of several key
technologies like groupware, messaging, web browsers,
document management, search and retrieval, data and
text mining, visualization, push technology, group
decision support, and intelligent agents. Knowledge
portals (internet and intranet) are the most common
infrastructure and play an important role in KM.
424 IMPACT OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS
Knowledge Structure
According to Gold et al. (2001), structure is defined as
the rules, policies, procedures, and processes, hierarchy
of reporting relationships, incentive systems, and
departmental boundaries that organize designs within
the firm. Maturana and Varela (1980) define structure as
`the actual static or dynamic components plus the actual
relations that take place between them'. According to
Mintzberg (1994), the organizations most frequently
group their employees based on knowledge and skills,
work process and function, time, output, client, or
place. An organization's structure is largely determined
by the variety one finds in its environment. Mintzberg
identifies four types of organizational forms, which are
associated with four combinations of complexity.
Ebert and Griffin (2005) define organizational
structure as the specification of jobs to be done within
an organization and the ways in which those jobs
relate to one another. According to Gold et al. (2001),
organizational structure is the second most critical
factor for successful KM implementation. Hasanali
(2002) highlights structure as one among five critical
success factors for KM. Organizational structure
has been identified as a major KM enabler by many
researchers in literature (Bose, 2004; Chourides,
Longbottom, & Murphy, 2003; Holsapple & Joshi, 2000;
Liebowitz, 1999; Wong, 2005).
Althoughintendedtorationalizeindividualfunctionsor
units within an organization, structural elements have
often had the unintended consequence of inhibiting
collaboration and sharing of knowledge across internal
organizational boundaries. It is important that the
organizational structures be designed for flexibility (as
opposed to rigidity) so that they encourage sharing and
collaboration. Managers have realized that bureaucratic
structuresslowdowntheprocessesandraiseconstraints
on information flow. In addition, such procedures often
consume great amount of time in order for knowledge
to filter through every level. Al-Alawi, Marzooqi, and
Mohammed (2007) and Syed-Ikhsan and Rowland
(2004) argue that knowledge sharing prospers with
structures that support ease of information flow with
fewer boundaries between divisions.
As the traditional orthodox organizational structure is
inadequateforaknowledge-basedorganization(Nonaka
& Takeuchi, 1995), a new organic organization structure
that encourages effective and efficient communication is
requiredtofosterknowledgecreationandsharing.Often
KM models report the need for flatter organizational
structures based on loosely coupled teams that form
networks of functions for the organization (Van Beveren,
2003). A flexible structure would allow the formation of
ad hoc cross-functional teams in which experts from
different departments can be gathered to facilitate the
flow of ideas across departments, or provide venues for
employees to communicate informally. Conventional
organizational structures need to be transformed to
support the development of a knowledge structure
(Oliver & Kandadi, 2006).
Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) develop a new
organizational structure, the hypertext organization
that enables their five-stage process of knowledge
creationtooccurefficientlywithintheorganization.This
is a combination of a formal organizational structure
and a non-hierarchical, self-organizing organizational
structure. However, a similar effect can be achieved
through maintaining the formal hierarchical structure
and adding the dimension of flexibility. Gold et al.
(2001) and Oliver and Kandadi (2006) have suggested
a hybrid organization structure for smooth KM
implementation. In such a structure, there are mixed
positions with varying degree of KM and functional
roles. Matrix structures and an emphasis on leadership
facilitate greater knowledge sharing primarily by
cutting across departmental boundaries.
As discussed earlier, some of the constituents of
organization structure are flexibility, modularity, policy,
and processes like rewards and incentive systems.
Studies have also proposed creation of several KM roles
(rather than exclusive KM jobs) which include chief
knowledge officer (CKO), knowledge programmers,
portal managers, content managers, and knowledge
analyst (Davenport & Prusak, 2000; Gordon, 2002; Gray,
1998;Rastogi,2000;Rumizen,2002).Theseauthorsareof
the view that some specialist positions are necessary for
developing knowledge structure in the organizations.
These structures are sustainable because: (a) people
in KM positions are also involved in core business
activities; (b) each functional division undertakes a
part of KM costs with embedded KM roles; (c) KM
programmes are integrated with functional divisions.
Another constituent of organization structure is the
importance given to team work. If the organization
structure is matrix-based as opposed to a bureaucratic
hierarchical base, it encourages team work. In module
and hypertext structure mentioned earlier, teams may
be formed for specific objectives, for example, R&D. A
flexible structure would allow the formation of ad hoc
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2015 425
cross-functional teams in which experts from different
departments can be gathered to ease the flow of ideas
across departments, or provide venues for employees
to communicate informally.
Many researchers have discovered that incentives and
rewards play a major role in KM (Alavi & Leidner,
2001; Davenport et al., 1998). Such initiatives not only
improve the amount of support that employees are
willing to give to activities of KM (Yeh et al., 2006) but
also enhance willingness to participate in knowledge
creation and sharing. Choy (2006) refers to performance
measurement as the key KM component for successful
KM implementation. Al-Alawi et al. (2007) state that
rewards must be based on group/team rather than
individual performance. Oliver and Kandadi (2006)
emphasize two points: (a) indirect rewards such as
appreciation and recognition play a greater role than
the monetary incentives; (b) long-term rewards such as
profit sharing and employee share option (ESOPs) are
more effective means than the short-term incentives.
Walczak (2005) observes that any knowledge that is
externalized into explicit form should be rewarded.
However, this knowledge being further reused by
other employees within the organization should also
be associated with rewards.
Knowledge Culture
Organizational culture is very important in leveraging
KM. It has been considered both as a facilitator
and a hurdle/barrier for effective KM. Culture of
an organization has key influence on KM, more
specifically, on the effectiveness of knowledge (Chase,
1997; Demarest, 1997; Holsapple & Joshi, 2000; Pan &
Scarbrough, 1998; Mårtensson, 2000) in an organization.
Tyler (1871) was the first to provide a formal description
of the term `culture'. He defined the term as: `that
complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art,
morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and
habits acquired by man as a member of society'. Steven
(1989) notes that organizational culture is akin to the
culture of the society in which the organization operates.
This view considers organizational culture as a micro-
culture within the culture of a given society or nation.
Since then many authors have defined organizational
cultureasthecombinationofvalue,corebelief,behaviour
model, and emblem. It represents the value system of
the company and will become the employees' behaviour
norm. Every organization's culture is an independent
entity different from any other organization (Yeh et
al., 2006). These cultural features of an organization
may deviate from cultures of their respective societies
(Lemken, Kahler, & Rittenbruch, 2000).
Since there is a crucial role of organizational culture
in KM, it is imperative to know how to influence and
develop knowledge culture in an organization. Oliver
and Kandadi (2006) have defined knowledge culture as:
`Away of organizational life that enables and motivates
people to create, share and utilize knowledge for the
benefit and enduring success of the organization.'
The presence of a `knowledge culture' is critical to
the success of KM within an organization (De Long &
Fahey, 2000; Nahm, Vonderembse, & Koufteros, 2004)
as it signals a managerial commitment to KM initiatives
and promotes sharing of tacit knowledge for higher
quality decision-making.
In the KM literature, a wide array of factors and concepts
are cited as influencing elements for the creation and
development of knowledge culture. These include
organizational structure, people, reward systems,
leadership, business processes, and information systems
(Gupta & Govindarajan, 2000; Wenger, McDermott, &
Snyder, 2002). Shaping culture is central to firm's ability
to manage its knowledge more effectively (De Long,
1997). This article discusses several variables studied
in the literature that build the knowledge culture in
an organization. Interaction between individuals is
essential in building innovative culture (Arrow, 1962;
Badaracco, 1991; Leonard & Sensiper, 1998). Dialogues
between individuals or groups are often the basis for the
creation of new ideas and can, therefore, be viewed as
having the potential for creating knowledge.
Employee interactions should be encouraged, both
formally and informally. This type of interaction and
collaboration is important in shaping organizational
culture conducive for KM. Instances like sharing
information freely, working closely with others, and
developing friends at work relate to interaction and
collaboration. Many authors have defined a form of
interaction where experienced workers or managers
transfer knowledge to new or less experienced workers
aspartoftheirorganizationculture.Al-Alawietal.(2007)
refer to the communication between staff measured by
high level of face-to-face interaction, use of common
language, and team work discussion and collaboration
as constituents of a knowledge enhancing culture.
Another important component of culture is corporate
vision (D'Aveni, 1995; Leonard-Barton, 1995)--a vision
426 IMPACT OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS
that permeates the organization to provide people with
a needed sense of purpose that transcends everyday
activities. Through an articulated and communicated
vision, it is possible to engender a sense of involvement
and contribution among employees (O'Dell & Grayson,
1998). A system of corporate values determines the
types of knowledge that are desired and the types of
knowledge related activities that are tolerated and
encouraged (Levinthal, 1998; Miles et. al., 1997). Trust
(Al-Alawi et al., 2007; Park, Ribiere, & Schulte, 2004)
and openness are commonly cited as two of these
explicitly stated values that promote KM behaviours.
Oliver and Kandadi (2006) refer to openness, to change,
and to experimentation as important constituents of a
knowledge enhancing culture.
Leadership at various levels of management (Oliver
& Kandadi, 2006) is also an important constituent
for developing knowledge culture in organizations.
The attributes include empowering and involving
employees. Leadership is required to develop a desired
culture and, hence, to develop knowledge culture
as well. The middle and front level managers play
an important role in developing knowledge culture
through the manifestation of various leadership
characteristics. Senior managers need to understand
the value of KM and are willing to support and play
an aggressive role in decision-making. According
to Davenport et al. (1998), one of the key successful
factors is the support of senior managers and it
includes: (a) conveying the information that KM and
organizational learning are key to the success of an
organization; (b) clarifying what kind of knowledge
is important to the organization; and (c) providing
financial and other resources to build the fundamental
building blocks of KM.
Knowledge Process Capabilities
In today's globally competitive environment,
knowledge-intensive organizations gain knowledge
and wisdom through their business activities. The
adherence of organizations to inflexible, ad hoc,
and indirect approaches can enable them to build
an environment facilitating KM but have limited
contribution towards facilitating knowledge as a
strategic asset and, thus, is a big corporate challenge.
Thus, we look at KM processes as those that would help
us build knowledge as a strategic resource which along
with infrastructure capabilities will drive knowledge
effectiveness and organizational performance.
Distinct knowledge processes are modelled in a
life cycle model which permits further analysis of
requirements for the support of KM activity in each
process. The processes of KM lifecycle approach
relate to the fact that organizations utilize internal
and external sources of knowledge. This knowledge
has to be made available to the concerned people
in the organization. Thus, a KM cycle starts with
creation and/or acquisition of knowledge which
has to be organized, mapped, and/or formalized
to transform it in reusable form. It has to be made
accessible to people, or disseminated, and/or shared
with everyone in the organization. Finally, it has to be
applied, used, reused, and/or exploited for achieving
the organizational benefits. Gold et al. (2001) have
grouped them into four broad dimensions of process
capability acquiring knowledge, converting it into
useful form, applying or using it, and protecting it.
Acquisition, storage, dissemination, and application
are identified as dimensions of process capability.
Acquisition Process
Acquisition-oriented KM processes are oriented
towards obtaining knowledge. However, prior to
acquisition, an organization must know the knowledge
it has within the organization in some form or other,
and the knowledge gaps. This sub-process is called
knowledge audit. Along with knowing the current
position, an organization should make efforts to
acquire knowledge and create new knowledge by using
processes and tools for the same. Many terms have
been used to describe these processes: acquire, discover,
seek, generate, create, capture, and collaborate. All of these
terms have a common theme--the accumulation of
knowledge. Innovation, another aspect of acquisition,
is the creation of new knowledge from the application
of existing knowledge. This requires concerted effort
and a high degree of experience in recognizing and
capturing new knowledge (Drucker, 1993). Improved
use of existing knowledge and more effective
acquisition of new knowledge is also a key aspect of
acquisition (Thurow, 1996). These processes take place
simultaneously rather than in a sequential manner.
The creation of organizational knowledge requires
collaboration of personal experiences (Inkpen & Dinur,
1998). Collaboration takes place at two levels within
the organization: between individuals and between
the organization and its network of business partners.
Collaboration between individuals brings together
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2015 427
individual differences (e.g., cognitive style, preferred
tools, backgrounds, experiences, etc.) and can be used to
create knowledge (Leonard-Barton, 1995). This assumes
that interaction between the individuals will promote
learning(Teece,1998).Collaborationbetweenindividuals
is also the basis for socialization (Nonaka & Takeuchi,
1995).However,theabilitytoacquireknowledgeispartly
based on an organization's absorptive capacity (Cohen
& Levinthal, 1990). This is because all the necessary
skills for innovation may not be found within a single
organization (Inkpen & Beamish, 1997) and, hence, is the
need to collaborate with partners.
Storage Process
Storage KM processes are oriented towards making
existing knowledge available at a central location,
easily accessible by everyone. Some of the processes
that enable knowledge conversion are a firm's ability to
organize (Davenport & Klahr, 1998), integrate (Grant,
1996), combine, structure, coordinate (Miller, Friesen,
& Mintzberg, 1984; Moore, 1996, Sanchez & Mahoney,
1996), and store knowledge (Zander & Kogut, 1995). An
organization must develop a framework for organizing
or structuring its knowledge (O'Dell & Grayson,
1998). Without common representation standards,
consistency or common dialogue of knowledge would
not exist. This would make it difficult to effectively
manage the asset. Knowledge about a particular subject
may reside in different parts of the organization or in
different systems within the organization. Combining
or integrating this knowledge reduces redundancy,
enhances consistent representation, and improves
efficiency by eliminating excess volume.
Thus, it is important for organizations to store
knowledge in a user-friendly, easily accessible form.
Explicit knowledge can be stored as best practices or
lessons learned databases. For tacit knowledge, the
conversion process makes available corporate portals
for accessing the expertise locator system.
Dissemination Process
Knowledge dissemination process refers to the
process of sharing among the employees in an
organization. Many organizations may just hoard
the knowledge, thinking that people will access
the same and use it. Effective retrieval mechanisms
allow for quick and easy access and sharing of
knowledge. For explicit knowledge, web portals and
organization intranet can play a crucial role. Using
text mining techniques to mine relevant knowledge
is characteristic of knowledge dissemination of
unstructured knowledge. Using intelligent agents
to actively build user profiles and push appropriate
lessons learned and material to user is another way
of knowledge dissemination. Chat rooms, bulletin
boards, online communications, communities of
practices, etc., on organization intranet also facilitate
knowledge sharing. However, for tacit knowledge
sharing, the knowledge conversion process makes
available corporate portals for accessing the expertise
locator system, but the dissemination process should
facilitate frequent get-togethers such as knowledge
fairs, seminars, and informal gatherings.
Application Process
Knowledge application processes are processes
oriented towards the use of knowledge. Having a
comprehensive KM system is of no utility if employees
of the organization are not using the same and
organization is not able to see the impact of the same
on its business performance.
It is important that KM helps the organization to use
the acquired knowledge to adjust strategic direction,
solve new problems, and improve efficiency. A regular
review is, therefore, required to know what has worked
well and what has not during the lifecycle of KM.
These processes also enable the organization to replace
knowledge that has become outdated.
Knowledge Management Effectiveness
Measuring KM effectiveness and its contribution to the
organizational performance is a key concern of many
organizations. As knowledge is an intangible strategic
asset of an organization, measuring it is a challenge.
Several approaches have been tried to measure this
intangibleassetbutcontributiontobusinessperformance
is still a major research agenda. In our KM model, we
propose that a good KM infrastructure and process
would improve KM effectiveness and would lead to
better organization performance. Thus, an organization
may invest in the KM systems but organizational
performance would depend on the effectiveness of KM
systems, which in turn depend on infrastructure and
process capabilities of an organization. Anantatmula
(2007) defines KM effectiveness in terms of useful
KM outcomes, such as improved communication,
428 IMPACT OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS
enhanced collaboration, improved employee skills,
better decision-making, and improved productivity.
Anantatmula's (2007) research has shown that the
attributes of KM effectiveness can lead to improvements
in performance such as customer satisfaction through
better product or service quality. This is possible due
to a learning environment, employee development,
effective communication tools, and knowledge sharing.
Empirical Studies on Knowledge Management
Effectiveness and Processes
Previous studies have considered relationship between
organizational culture and organizational effectiveness
(Park et al., 2014). Also studied is the impact of
organizational culture on KM success (Zheng, 2005).
Organization culture and processes have influence
on KM effectiveness (Park, 2006). Mooradian, Renzl,
and Matzler (2006) study the relationship between
organizational culture and the knowledge sharing
process at the team level. Moon and Lee (2014) study
the mediating effect of the knowledge sharing process.
Teo and Bhattacherjee (2014) examine infrastructural
capability as an antecedent of knowledge transfer and
utilization. Further, infrastructural capabilities have also
been studied in terms of a KM capability between supply
relationship management and performance (Tseng, 2014).
Despite different theoretical studies and assertion, the
directimpactoftheinfrastructuralandprocesscapabilities
has not been studied. This study explores the impact of
these capabilities. Thus, our research hypothesis is:
Hypothesis 1: There is significant impact of organization
KM infrastructure capabilities on KM effectiveness.
Hypothesis 2: There is significant impact of organization
KM processes capabilities on KM effectiveness.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Instrument Development and Data Collection
The unit of analysis in this study was an organization.
The objective was to measure the KM practices of
large Indian organizations. The latest list of 1,000 large
Indian organizations available in The Economics Times
(2010) was taken as the sample. The literature related
to KM capabilities was reviewed in order to specify the
measures. Data was gathered through a survey that
tapped responses from ET 1000 companies in India.
Direct telephonic conversations were made to introduce
the objectives and to identify the contact person for
the survey. A total of 156 filled questionnaires were
received, the response rate being 15.6 per cent. The
respondents were asked to evaluate the items using
the Likert scale of 1­5 (1 being strongly disagree and 5
being strongly agree).
Data Analysis and Results
The goal of structured equation modelling (SEM) is
to determine a valid causal model. The advantage
of structured equation model is that, it can test the
entire system of variables in a hypothesized model.
Thus it enables the assessment of the consistency of
the model with data (Byrne, 1998). SEM is chosen so
that the causal relationships between construct and
multiple measurement items could be tested (Jöreskog
& Sörbom, 1996).
Reliability of Constructs
Cronbach's a was used to assess the internal consistency
of the proposed constructs. Cronbach's a is a widely
used metrics for reliability evaluation (Koufteros et
al., 2001). A questionnaire with an a of 0.8 is generally
considered reliable (Field, 2009). Table 1 shows that
there is high internal consistency for every variable.

are shown in Table 3. Hypothesis H1 is supported,
which means knowledge infrastructural capabilities
have a significant positive impact on organizational
knowledge effectiveness (b = 0.48, p < 0.01). Hypothesis,
H2 is also supported, that is, process capabilities
have a significant positive impact on organizational
knowledge effectiveness (b = 0.60, p < 0.01). Figure 2
shows the results of the research model.

Structured Equation Model
The model was examined using SEM in AMOS 4 in two
portions: (a) the measurement model, for checking the
adequacy of measurement properties of the variables
and (b) the path model, for checking the significance
in the relationships among variables. The overall fit of
a hypothesized model was tested by using AMOS (a
software package for SEM) output and other fit indices
such as the ratio of chi-square to degrees of freedom,
goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted GFI (AGFI),
comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square residual
(RMSR), root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), standardized residual, and modification
index (MI).
Measurement Model
The measurement model was checked for internal
consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant
validity. For convergent validity, the values of
Composite Reliability (CR) and Average Variance
Extracted (AVE) should be greater than 0.7 and 0.5,
respectively. For discriminant validity of the constructs,
the values of Maximum Shared Variance (MSV) and
Average Shared Variance (ASV) should be less than
AVE (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2010).
Table 1 shows that all the variables exhibit a convergent
and discriminant validity.
The measurement model with three variables constructs
was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. All
the factor loadings exceeded 0.5 and each indicator
was found to be significant at 0.01 significant levels. To
assess the model fit, the chi-square (c²) values (Kline,
2010), comparative fix index (Bentler, 1990), and root
mean square error of approximation (Steiger, 1990)
were reported. These indexes ensure that an improved
overall fit is provided relative to the null model. The CFI
and GFI have been considered the best approximations,
with values greater than or equal to 0.90 considered
indicative of a good fit (Chin & Todd, 1995; Hoyle, 1995;
Segars & Grover, 1993). RMSEA is a measure of the
average standardized residual per degree of freedom; a
favourable value is less than or equal to 0.10 (Browne &
Cudeck, 1989).
The results shown in Table 2 confirm a good level of fit
for the model.

DISCUSSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
This is the first study for large Indian organizations
and is in line with the other studies conducted
elsewhere. Large Indian organizations have started
realizing the importance of managing knowledge
as a strategic asset. However, the approach towards
KM varies. Some organizations rely more on creating
a knowledge culture in an organization while
others emphasize the need for a process approach
to manage both tacit and explicit knowledge within
the organization. As illustrated in Table 3, the
paths between KM infrastructure capabilities and
knowledge effectiveness are positive and significant.
Hence, it can be concluded that infrastructure
capabilities that constitute culture, structure, and IT
infrastructure play an important role in improving
organization effectiveness mainly resulting in
improved communication, enhanced collaboration,
improved employee skills, better decision-making,
and improved productivity. It has been observed that
culture of an organization is very deep rooted and to
bring about structural changes within an organization
is not that easy as it requires policy level changes.
However, large organizations are process centric and
implementing processes is easier. Thus, technology
implementation and building and implementing KM
processes would impact knowledge effectiveness
significantly as it is easy to implement processes than
to bring about changes in culture and structure.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
A response rate of 15.6 per cent can give rise to
inaccuracy in the survey data due to sampling bias. It
is a limitation and effort should be made to improve
it. Together, these results suggest that capabilities can
provide a useful benchmark for KM within the firm.
However, it is important to carry out further research
in linking infrastructure and process variables of
KM with the firm's performance. It will, thus, give a
significant tool to the managers to further implement
such activities in their organizations.
