Abstract
Background: Recent experimental evidence suggests that stressed males find heavier women more attractive than non-
stressed males. The aim of this study is to examine whether these results also appear in actual mating patterns of adults
from a national sample.
Methods: Regression analysis linking partner weight measures to own measures of childhood stress, as measured by
mistreatment. Cross-sectional data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Romantic Partners Sample is
used to measure partner weight, childhood stressful events, and socio-demographic characteristics. Childhood experiences
of adult mistreatment are retrospectively collected.
Results: Men who experienced childhood mistreatment are more likely to have obese female partners during young
adulthood. The results are strongest for interactions with social services, adult neglect and physical abuse. We also present
novel evidence of the opposite association in similarly stressed women whose male partners are more likely to be thin.
Conclusions: These results suggest that preferences for partner characteristics are sensitive to histories of stress and that
previously hypothesized patterns occur outside the experimental setting.

Introduction
There is a substantial body of evidence supporting an inverse
association between resource scarcity and body size preference
based on the hypothesis that a larger body size may indicate
greater access to food or other resources [1]. This hypothesis has
been generalized to motivate studies relating several forms of stress
to body size preferences, much of which has been focused on
studying men's preferences for women's body size and type. For
example, hunger [2], psychological stress [1], socioeconomic status
[3], and financial insecurity [4,5] have been suggested as potential
manifestations of resource insecurity affecting men's preferences,
generally revealing a pattern that men under greater stress prefer
heavier women.
The relationship between resource scarcity or stress and
women's preferences for men's body types is less clear, with some
evidence suggesting that hungry women exhibit a slightly higher
preference for heavier, taller, and older men [2]. The paucity of
conclusive evidence for women may be partly explained by women
reporting personality characteristics as relatively more important
than body type than do men [6]. In addition, women could
express partner preferences for body type along dimensions that
may be less immediately affected by resource scarcity such as
height [7] or waist-chest ratio [8]. Under the ``dual mating
hypothesis'', which proposes that women's sexual preferences
change across the menstrual cycle [9], a greater variability in
women's preferences could lead to greater variability in pairing
across physical characteristics. Furthermore, there is evidence that
women's stated preferences about body type are less correlated
with their partner's actual characteristics than are men's stated
preferences [10]. This may suggest that body mass index,
specifically, is less important in partner decisions for women than
it is for men.
The long-term effects of stress on preferences for partner
characteristics remain largely unknown. Child abuse is known to
be associated with a variety of long-term health-related behaviors
and outcomes including depression, substance abuse, and suicide
[11­13], any of which may affect partner choice. Evidence based
on ``betrayal trauma theory'' suggests that child abuse can have a
direct effect on partner choice when trauma leads to dissociation
and a lack of betrayal awareness by leading a victim of abuse to
ignore signals about potential partner betrayal. Consistent with
this possibility, participants in a study who experienced high
trauma rated partner loyalty as less important than participants
who experienced medium or low trauma [14].
The ``cycle of violence'' hypothesis also predicts that violence
through child abuse or other trauma will increase the likelihood of
violent acts later in life, and stress has been found to increase
aggression more acutely for persons with a history of child
maltreatment in an experimental setting [15]. A primary
assumption underlying the theory of marriage and intra-household
bargaining [16] is that partners select and maintain a relationship
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66353
only if the relationship is valued more by each partner than is the
value of being single. An implication of this assumption is that
relationships which involve negative impacts on a partner's well-
being, such as violence toward that partner, may involve a lower
``threat point'' to leave the relationship. Partners who have what
are considered more desirable characteristics, e.g. thinness in
women [10], may be therefore less likely to join or more likely to
end a relationship involving violence. In a large cross-sectional
survey, women with any lifetime experiences of intimate partner
violence (IPV) reported a significantly higher prevalence of
elevated body mass index (BMI) than women who had not
experienced IPV, but there was no significant difference for men
across IPV status [17].
Studies that have tested the relationship between stress and sex-
related or partner preferences for body weight typically only
measure surveyed preferences and induce stress in an experimental
setting. To our knowledge, no study examines the relationship
between reported long term stress and the body type profiles of
men and women who self-report as partners. By utilizing a unique,
nationally representative data set of partner dyads we are able to
study the relationship between early life stressors, such as abuse,
experienced by each partner pair and their effects on partner body
weight characteristics in real world relationships.
Methods
Ethical Statement
The human subjects committee at Yale University approved this
study. Participants provided written informed consent to partic-
ipate in the Add Health.
Participants
Participants include nearly 1,500 pairs of individuals in the
``Couples Sample'' collected in the third wave (2000/1) of the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Heath).
Of these individuals, approximately 500 pairs were married, 500
pairs were cohabitating, and 500 pairs were dating. The Add
Health is a nationally representative study of 7th to 12th graders
from 1994 and 1995 who have been followed longitudinally.
Approximately 750 individuals from the main study were sub-
sampled and a ``romantic partner'' was recruited for the Couples
Sample. Each individual in the pairs were administered a similar
survey. Participants ranged in age between 18­43 (the main Add
Health respondents ranged in age between 18­26, while their
partners' ages were unrestricted). Each individual's body mass
index was measured; the male average was 27.05 and the female
average was 26.41.

Child Stress and Partner Weight Characteristics
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66353
Materials
The Add Health survey included standard socio-demographic
questions, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, maternal educa-
tional attainment, and own educational attainment as well as
retrospective reports of childhood mistreatment, which will be our
key measures of long term stress. All information is known from
each individual in each pair, allowing a dyadic analysis of current
partners. Key measures for the analysis include each partner's
weight, history of childhood mistreatment, and gender.
Childhood mistreatment measures. Respondents were
asked a series of retrospective questions about their parents and
other adults' mistreatment before the respondent was in 6th grade.
These include: how often they were (i) left alone when an adult
should have been with them (ii) not taken care of in their basic
needs, such as keeping clean and providing food and clothing (iii)
slapped, hit, or kicked (iv) touched in a sexual way (v) had social
services investigated the family or tried to take them out of their
living situation. Categorical answers for (i-iv) included: (A) one
time (B) two times (C) three to five times (D) six to ten times (E)
more than ten times (F) this never happened. Question (v) allowed
any number to be reported (range 0 to 60). A small proportion of
individuals refused to answer these questions or responded they
``don't know''. We combine these responses in the main analysis
by using a factor analysis on items (i-iv) [13] and using item (v) as a
summary measure of abuse that was severe enough to be reported
to social services, which occurred in approximately 6 percent of
the sample. In auxiliary analysis we also create ``ever measures'' of
i-iv, where approximately 40% were ``left alone'', 10­15% had
``unmet basic needs'', 30% were physically abused, and approx-
imately 5% were sexually abused (see Table S1A).
Weight measures. Respondents weights and heights were
measured by interviewers. Body mass index is created by using the
ratio of weight (kilograms) and height (meters- squared). Over-
weight status is defined as a BMI greater or equal to 25 and obese
status is defined as a BMI greater or equal to 30.
Statistical Analysis
Recent experimental evidence has suggested that, for males,
induced stress increases preferences for larger body size [1]. The
current analysis extends this evidence by using OLS regression
analysis to estimate associations between partner weight and own
childhood mistreatment. This is accomplished with the following
empirical specification:
weightj
~b0
zb1
mistreatmenti
zb2
Xzb3
weighti
ze ð1Þ
where the vector X is a set of dyadic controls (e.g. age, education,
maternal education, race/ethnicity) and weighti controls the
processes that generate homophily in partner characteristics
among couples. As described above, we use three alternative
measures of ``mistreatment'' when estimating equation (1)­(A) a
principal component summary of our child mistreatment measures
(B) the social services indicator and (C) each of the principal
component measures as separate predictors. Equation (1) is
estimated separately for men and women (with respect to
individual i). All analysis was completed using Stata Version 11.0.
Results
Table S1 provides sample descriptive statistics and detailed
information on the variables described above and studied in the
analyses. Table 1 presents results from equation (1) where the
outcome is female weight and the key independent variable is male
childhood mistreatment. Each column reports a separate regres-
sion and unstandardized beta coefficients are presented for each
independent variable. Column 1 shows that males with higher
measures of childhood mistreatment are 3.2 percentage points
more likely to have a female partner who is obese. Column 2
shows that males who were investigated by social services during

childhood are 9 percentage points more likely to have an obese
female partner. Columns 3­6 show that these results are
qualitatively similar for outcomes of female BMI and female
overweight, though these results are not statistically significant.
Table 2 examines more specific measures of childhood
mistreatment by including four separate measures of whether the
individual was ever ``left alone'', had ``unmet basic needs'', was
ever physically abused, and was ever sexually abused. Column 1
suggests that childhood experiences with unmet needs and physical
abuse are positively related to female partner BMI during
adulthood. Columns 2 and 3 suggests an increase in the likelihood
of having an overweight female partner for those with unmet basic
needs and an increase in the likelihood of having an obese female
partner for those experiencing childhood physical abuse. No
significant relationships are found for being left alone or sexually
abused.
While the prior literature typically focuses on the effects of stress
on men in determining partner weight, we next examine the
converse­what is the effect of long-term stress (as measured by
childhood mistreatment) on women in determining (male) partner
weight? Table 3 repeats Table 1 specifications but transposes the
gender of the partner­now we ask the relationship between
women's exposure to childhood mistreatment and the weight
attributes of their adult male partners. Unlike the results for the
effects of stressful male childhoods, the results suggest that females
who experience stressful childhoods are less likely to have partners
who are overweight or obese. For example, in Column 2 in
Table 3, we find that females who were investigated by social
services during childhood are nearly 12 percentage points less
likely to have an obese romantic partner as an adult than women
who report no such investigation. Likewise, Columns 3 and 4 show
strong negative correlations between the mistreatment factor and
male partner BMI as well as between the social services indicator
and male partner BMI (1.5 units lower vs women not investigated
by social services). Columns 5 and 6 again shows that women who
experienced childhood mistreatment are between 5­10 percentage
points less likely to have a romantic partner who is overweight
than women who did not have this experience. Unlike our results
in Table 2, Table 4 shows little consistent evidence for the ``type''
of stressor that is related to partner weight. Only one of the specific
childhood mistreatment variables are statistically related to male
partner weight.
Discussion
In this study, we examined the long-term effects of childhood
stress, as measured by mistreatment, on preferences for body type.
We used a nationally representative sample of adults first

Child Stress and Partner Weight Characteristics

interviewed as 7th to 12th graders in 1994 and 1995 who were later
interviewed along with their romantic partners in 2001. We
compared partner weight characteristics for both men and
women, including BMI, obese, and overweight status, among
respondents according to their experience of childhood mistreat-
ment after controlling for several potential confounders including
own weight status, age, education, race, ethnicity, and marital
status. Broadly speaking, the results suggest that men who
experienced child abuse tend to prefer a heavier female body size
in their partners while women who experienced child abuse may
prefer lighter male body size.
More specifically, men who experienced a high mistreatment
factor according to a factor analysis of questions describing several
aspects of parental and other adult abuse experiences had female
partners with significantly greater BMI and were significantly
more likely to be in a relationship with an obese female partner.
Men whose abuse was severe enough to be reported to social
services similarly had partners with greater BMI and who were
more likely to be obese, although only the latter effect was
statistically significant. When simultaneously comparing potential
child abuse experiences in a regression analysis, men whose basic
needs were not taken care of and men who were physically abused
as children were those likely to have heavier partners.
Unlike many previous studies, we also considered how child
mistreatment among women affects their preferences for male
body type according to the weight and abuse measures described
above. Perhaps unexpectedly, women with a higher mistreatment
factor had male partners with lower average BMI and probability
of being overweight, and women whose mistreatment was
reported to social services exhibited preferences for lighter males,
according to every measure. When considering all of the
underlying types of child mistreatment simultaneously the results
were largely insignificant but the point estimates for the partner
weight preference effect was consistently negative, in almost every
case.
Overall these results in part confirm previous work on body type
preference but also suggest opportunities for future research. In
particular, male preferences for romantic partners appear
consistent with the ``environmental security hypothesis'' [1,2] in
the long term, as measured by the effects of childhood stress on
adult partner preference. Further supporting this confirmatory
evidence is the finding that the strongest association between
childhood mistreatment and female body size arose for men who
identified their needs as not having been met as children. In this
sense, prolonged experiences of unmet need may have similar long
run effects as immediate sensations indicating scarcity. That men
who experienced physical abuse as children similarly exhibited a
preference for heavier body types also lends support to the
hypothesis that the ``cycle of violence'' effect [15] may lead those
men to enter into relationships in which partner violence is more
accepted.
Perhaps the most unexpected results were for the effects of
childhood mistreatment on partner body size preferences among
women. As described earlier, women tended to have partners with
lower BMI and who were less likely to be overweight or obese if
they experienced child abuse. Interestingly, this relationship does
not appear to be concentrated among any subset of mistreatment
types but is similar for women who were left alone, whose needs
were unmet, and who were physically or sexually abused. A
potential explanation for this association may lie in the fact that
BMI and, by implication overweight and obesity status, do not
adequately distinguish between muscle mass and body fat when
measuring the underlying weight component [18]. Since the
sample used in the current analysis does not include other
measures of body type we are not able to separately distinguish
alternative potential explanations for female preferences for body
type, such as waist-chest ratio [8]. A more complete classification
of body types may yield important evidence in future research in
this area.

Child Stress and Partner Weight Characteristics
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66353
An important strength of this study is that it is based on a
nationally representative sample, so the findings herein may be
broadly generalized. In addition, this analysis offers to our
knowledge the first ``real world'' study of actual partner pairings
in a generalizable sample. Previous research in this area has
typically examined stated preferences for hypothetical ideal types,
often in experimental settings. As such the findings from this study
may be particularly relevant for considering how child abuse and
related circumstances including poverty and resource deprivation
among men and women may affect the desirability of body types,
both self-perceived and perceived among others.
The primary limitations of this study result from common
tradeoffs encountered when conducting observational studies,
more generally. At the expense of producing novel findings with
respect to ``real world'' partner choices, the current study may not
adequately control for all relevant characteristics of the partner
dyads. For example, it has been hypothesized that stress may affect
``self-esteem, empathy, or related constructs'' [1] and it is
indirectly through these channels, rather than directly, that stress
influences partner weight preferences. Although we confirmed that
our results are generally robust to the inclusion of other known
outcomes of childhood mistreatment including depression and
substance abuse (see Tables S2 and S3), more research is needed.
This general concern may be more relevant for women than men
since the results for the latter are broadly consistent with previous
hypotheses and experiments, but it is not possible to know with
certainty. Additionally, our measure of childhood mistreatment is
retrospective and could possibly be affected by reporting bias. We
believe that any reporting bias would be unrelated to weight
preferences and would have difficulty explaining the gender
differences in weight preferences we report. However, future
research able to access mistreatment (or other stressors) prospec-
tively would be a useful next step. Future research leveraging
natural experiments or quasi-experimental designs may also more
accurately estimate causal relationships in ``real world'' settings.
