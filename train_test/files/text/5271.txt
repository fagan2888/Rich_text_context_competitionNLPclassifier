Introduction
The Urbanicity Effect
The phenomenon known as the "urbanicity effect" refers to
the accruing body of evidence that living in urban areas has
detrimental effects on mental health and well-being. This
research began in earnest when Faris and Dunham (1939)
reported a per capita linear decrease in rates of severe mental
illness from densely populated, disorganized, inner-city
regions, to affluent, residential areas on the outskirts. More
recent research supports Faris and Dunham's finding with
one meta-analysis showing that urban environments confer a
2.37 times greater risk of schizophrenia than rural environ-
ments (Vassos, Pederson, Murray, Collier, & Lewis, 2012).
While there has been some attempt to explain the relation-
ship between psychosis and urban living in terms of down-
ward social drift (Murali & Oyebode, 2004), dose-response
evidence suggests that there is a more fundamental, causal
relationship between urban living and psychosis
(Krabbendam & Van Os, 2005; Pedersen & Mortensen,
2001; Van Os, 2004). Furthermore, although effect sizes are
smaller, urban environments have been shown to increase
risk of major depression and anxiety (Lederbogen et al.,
2011; Peen, Schoevers, Beekman, & Dekker, 2010;
Sundquist, Frank, & Sundquist, 2004; Wang, 2004). These
analyses have used population density to define urbanity, and
some researchers have commented that this tight epidemio-
logical research focus limits our understanding of the spe-
cific effects of physical and social contexts on mental health
(Weich, Twigg, & Lewis, 2006). These authors suggest a
need to widen the focus of research into the urbanicity effect
and to develop methods that enable the objective study of
how people respond to different living environments.
The Physical and Socioeconomic Urban Context
In the United Kingdom, 98% of the most deprived areas are
found in cities, tending to be areas where urban regeneration
initiatives are focused (Department of Communities and
Local Government [DCLG], 2011). However, research has
continued to find urbanicity effects even when controlling
for indices of deprivation (McKenzie, Murray, & Booth,
2013). Such findings indicate that some of the urbanicity
effect may be attributed to the psychosocial stress associated
with living in physical and social environments perceived to

Abstract
An accruing body of research suggests that urban environments negatively affect mental health and well-being. It is thought
that some of this so-called "urbanicity effect" can be explained by the perceived quality of the living environment. The two
studies reported here used online survey methods to explore changes to self-reported psychological mechanisms thought to
underpin mental health and well-being before and after participants briefly contemplated urban/rural or desirable/undesirable
residential images. Our findings demonstrate that even brief contemplation of places change how we consider our futures and
that places deemed relatively undesirable appear to promote a threat-focused anticipatory set. Importantly, these changes
were not found to be associated with perceived urbanity but rather with perceived desirability of place. These findings should
be considered alongside increasing evidence that urban regeneration and place-making are matters of public health concern.

be impoverished (Ellaway, Macintyre, & Kearns, 2001;
Ellaway et al., 2009; Kirkbride, Jones, Ullrich, & Coid,
2012; Weich et al., 2002). Furthermore, and linking to poten-
tial psychological and social mechanisms, Evans (2003) has
proposed that the physical characteristics of place impact on
mental health and well-being by influencing sense of control
with aspects such as lack of community cohesion, perceived
risk of crime, and sense of belonging all associated with
worse mental health outcomes (Ellaway et al., 2001; Romans,
Cohen, & Forte, 2011; Stafford, Chandola, & Marmot, 2007).
The potential of certain transdiagnostic psychological mech-
anisms to explain the urbanicity effect is particularly
compelling.
Psychological Mechanisms and Urbanicity
In terms of underlying information processing, depression,
anxiety, and paranoia have much in common, including a
heightened external locus of control (LoC), heightened antic-
ipation and avoidance of social threat, and an underestima-
tion of the likelihood of future positive events (Bird, Mansell,
Dickens, & Tai, 2013; Bentall et al., 2009; Corcoran et al.,
2006; Moutoussis, Williams, Dayan, & Bentall, 2007). These
same psychological profiles are found, at attenuated levels,
in nonclinical populations as shown in research adopting a
mental health continuum approach (Freeman et al., 2008;
Johns & Van Os, 2001; Van Os, 2003; Van et al., 2009;
Verdoux & Van Os, 2002). LoC refers to the extent to which
an individual believes that his/her life course is determined
by themselves or by external forces such as luck or "power-
ful others" (Rotter, 1966). Robustly linked to depression,
anxiety, and paranoia in both clinical and nonclinical sam-
ples, an external LoC has also been reported in association
with more individualistic cultures and with ethnic minority
status (Cheng, Cheung, Chio, & Chan, 2013; Harrow,
Hansford, Astrachan-Fletcher, 2009; Johnson & Sarason,
1978; Moritz, Woodward, Burlon, Braus, & Andresen, 2007;
Twenge, Zhang, & Im, 2004; Van Dijk, Dijkshoorn, Van
Dijk, Cremer, & Agyemang, 2013).
A heightened attention to threat has been demonstrated in
a number of ways, including attentional bias to negative and
threatening stimuli and a tendency to overestimate the likeli-
hood of future threatening events with findings associated
with depression, anxiety, and paranoia (Bennett & Corcoran,
2010; Corcoran et al., 2006; Kaney, Bowen-Jones, Dewey, &
Bentall, 1997; Kellough, Beevers, Ellis, & Wells, 2008;
MacLeod, Mathews, & Tata, 1986).
As well as LoC and threat focus, low mental well-being is
characterized by future orientation biases and deficits (Drake,
Duncan, Sutherland, Abernethy, & Henry, 2008). Cognitive
models of depression, anxiety, and paranoia all emphasize
negative views about the future (Abler, Erk, Herwig, &
Walter, 2007; Bentall et al., 2009; Paulus & Yu, 2012; Strunk
& Adler, 2009). More generally, the extent to which people
consider and plan for their futures (consideration of future
consequences [CFC]) broadly predicts behavior, health, and
well-being (Pepper & Nettle, 2014; Strathman, Gleicher,
Boninger, & Edwards, 1994). Individuals with an attenuated
future orientation are more focused on maximizing immedi-
ate benefits and therefore consideration of one's future nega-
tively correlates with impulsivity, a robust transdiagnostic
feature of mental health and well-being (Whiteside & Lynam,
2001).
Lived experiences of victimization, discrimination, and
powerlessness, linked to inner-city living, serve to confirm
the beliefs associated with these mental health symptoms
(Evans-Polce, Hulbert, & Latkin, 2013; Janssen et al., 2003;
Mirowsky & Ross, 1983; Ross, Mirowsky & Pribesh, 2001;
Schreier et al., 2009). Thus, the psychological processing
styles and beliefs associated with depression, anxiety, and
paranoid feelings are also associated with living in impover-
ished neighborhoods (Chen & Paterson, 2006; Ross &
Mirowsky, 2009; Witt, 1989). Paál, Carpenter, and Nettle
(2015) found that neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES)
predicted individual levels of behavioral inhibition, a charac-
teristic invariably associated with impulsive traits and future
discounting. Furthermore, and directly relevant to the para-
digm employed in this study, Liu, Feng, Suo, Lee, and Li
(2012) explored how brief exposure to cues of poverty or
affluence influenced the intertemporal choices made by their
participants. These authors found that exposure to the images
of poverty tended to increase participants' impulsivity, mak-
ing them prefer smaller immediate over larger future-based
rewards. Thus, Liu et al.'s findings are indicative of a reduced
consideration of the future in response to visual cues of
poverty.
The Effects of Brief Exposure to Inner-City Areas
on Mental Health and Well-Being
Recent research by Ellett, Freeman, and Garety (2008) has
suggested that an "urbanicity effect" is measurable in non-
residents after a brief exposure to a deprived urban neighbor-
hood. In a study in which individuals with persecutory
delusions were briefly exposed to a deprived urban neighbor-
hood during a walk, these authors reported that participants
showed increased anxiety and paranoia alongside increased
negative beliefs about others. Nettle, Pepper, Jobling, and
Schroeder (2014) found similar results when students were
exposed to an unfamiliar deprived urban neighborhood.
These authors demonstrated that student visitors reported
similar levels of paranoia and trust to that of the neighbor-
hood residents after just brief exposure to the area.
The Current Research
The studies reported here extend the paradigm of Liu et al.
(2012) to explore the effects on LoC, anticipation of threat
(AoT), and CFC of a very brief, remote consideration of
place photographs. We chose this method because a strong
Corcoran et al. 3
case can be made about the effects of sustained exposure to
certain kinds of urban environments on mental health and
well-being if changes to psychological variables can be dem-
onstrated to follow very brief and indirect exposure to the
same kinds of places.
As well as exploring the difference between perceived
quality of areas, we aimed to assess the extent to which a so-
called biophilic predisposition (Wilson, 1984,) may account
for the urbanicity effect. The biophilic hypothesis is becom-
ing increasingly influential in public health and urban plan-
ning (Mitchell & Popham, 2007; Thompson et al., 2012).
However, a criticism of many studies reporting the positive
effects of green space on health and well-being is that neigh-
borhoods with green spaces are typically considered to be of
generally higher desirability. We attempt to explore this criti-
cism here using a methodology that can dissociate between
the "green-ness" and the perceived desirability of residential
places.
Aims and Hypotheses
This pair of studies aimed to explore whether very brief con-
templation of place images can elicit changes in the self-
reported psychological mechanisms associated with mental
health and well-being. The images selected differed in degree
of (a) urbanity (rural or urban) or (b) subjective desirability
(rated high or low on the question, "How nice is this place?").
It was anticipated that scores on measures of LoC, AoT,
and CFC would change in response to the active contempla-
tion of place images and that these changes would be related
to the perceived urbanity (lack of green-ness) of the environ-
ments as well as their perceived desirability. Specifically:
·
· In support of the biophilic hypothesis, we expected
that the contemplation of urban but not rural images
would lead to increased external LoC, enhanced AoT,
and a reduction in CFC.
·
· In support of suggestions that the urbanicity effect is
associated with the quality of living environments, we
expected that the contemplation of less desirable but
not more desirable places would lead to increased
external LoC, enhanced AoT, and a reduction in CFC.
·
· We expected that any changes to LoC, AoT, and CFC
related to contemplating the place images would be
associated with elevated feelings of depression, anxi-
ety, and/or paranoia.
Method
Pilot Studies: Image Selection
Study A: Urban versus rural. Ten aerial and 10 street view pho-
tographs of typical urban and rural neighborhoods, none
showing people, were sourced from across the United King-
dom. Some were the teams' own photographs and others
were found on the Internet. The photos were selected to show
residential areas and a similar numbers vehicles.
A sample of 25 participants (12 male, 13 female) aged 18
to 54 were asked to rate all 20 photographs (10 urban and 10
rural each with five aerial and five street view) on the extent
to which they considered the neighborhoods as urban (0 =
not urban, 100 = very urban) and the extent to which they
considered the neighborhoods as rural (0 = not rural, 100 =
very rural).
The participants were also asked to rate the photographs
for perceived desirability using the question "How nice is
this place?" rated using 0 to 100 scale. To control for any dif-
ferences in perceived desirability of the places, only the pho-
tos with overall mean scores falling within the central
quartiles (25-49 and 50-74) for the question "How nice is
this place?" were considered for inclusion in the main study.
Eight images clearly regarded as urban (four images, two
aerial and two street view) or rural (four images, two aerial
and two street view) were selected for use as stimuli in the
main study. An independent samples "t" test comparing the
average urbanity ratings of the selected urban and rural pho-
tos confirmed that the selected urban images were rated sig-
nificantly higher than the selected rural images for urbanity
(urban: M = 70.03, SD = 10.50; rural: M = 30.70, SD = 9.67),
t(6) = 5.51, p = .001, d = 3.90 (one-tailed).
Study B: Desirable versus undesirable. A set of 24 photographs
representing typical residential neighborhoods in the United
Kingdom were collected. Some were the teams' own photo-
graphs and others were found on the Internet. None of the
collected photographs showed extremely impoverished, run
down, or derelict places. The images were selected to be
similar in terms of amount of green space and vehicles shown
and none included people. All images were street as opposed
to aerial view to better capture the "desirability" of the resi-
dential area.Asample of 21 participants (10 male, 11 female)
aged 18 to 58 were shown all 24 photographs and asked to
respond to the following questions to rate the desirability of
the environment (0-100 scale):
How "nice" is this place?" And "How much would you like to
live in this place?
To select the most and least desirable urban residential pho-
tographs from the set of 24, a mean response score for each
participant was calculated for the above questions. The top
five highest and lowest ranked images were used in the main
study as the more desirable and less desirable place images.
An independent samples t test comparing the average desir-
ability ratings of the five more desirable and five less desir-
able images confirmed that the more desirable images were
rated significantly higher than the less desirable images
(most desirable: M = 70.60, SD = 5.09; least desirable: M =
31.50, SD = 4.39), t(8) = -13.01, p < .001, d = 8.23
(one-tailed).

Participants
Data were provided by first-year undergraduate psychology
students completing research studies in exchange for course
credits.
Study A: Urban versus rural.A total of 173 participants com-
pleted the online survey that included the four urban photo-
graphs while a different sample of 183 completed the survey
that included the four rural photographs. After filtering for
incomplete data and excluding any participants who
requested that their data be deleted, the final complete sam-
ple for analyses was 317 (urban: n = 162, rural: n = 155).
Study B: Desirable versus undesirable.A total of 186 partici-
pants completed the online survey that included the five pho-
tos of the more desirable urban neighborhoods while a
different sample of 175 completed the survey that included
the photos of the five less desirable neighborhoods. After fil-
tering for incomplete data and excluding any participants
who requested that their data be deleted, the final complete
sample for analyses was 298 (more desirable: n = 141, less
desirable: n = 157). Table 1 provides more detail of the par-
ticipant demographics.
The majority of participants in both studies were female
aged between 18 and 24 years with each participant contrib-
uting data to only one of the four surveys. The sex ratio and
age reflect the student population studying undergraduate
psychology in the United Kingdom. It was very unlikely that
participants knew the depicted neighborhoods as the photo-
graphs were of diverse UK areas.
The Online Survey Measures
The measures that made up the four surveys were presented
in the fixed order below.
1. The Persecution and Deservedness Scale (PaDS per-
secution only; Melo, Corcoran, Shryane, & Bentall,
2009) is a 10-item measure of paranoid thinking
designed for use in both nonclinical and clinical sam-
ples. Statements refer to direct or indirect intentional
harm from others, and respondents are asked to rate
the extent to which they agree with each statement on
a 5-point scale. The scale has been shown to have
high internal consistency in a nonclinical, student
sample ( = 0.84).
2. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21;
Henry & Crawford, 2005) is a 21-item self-report
scale used to measure the severity of symptoms relat-
ing to depression, anxiety, and stress on a 4-point
scale. Compared with other validated measures,
DASS21 has high internal consistency ( = 0.93; CI
95
= 0.93 to 0.94), and good convergent and discrimi-
nant validity in a nonclinical adult sample.
3. Locus of Control Scale (LoC; Rotter, 1966) is used
to measure perceived control over one's life. For
each of 13 paired statements, respondents are asked
to indicate which alternative best describes their
attitude. A high score is indicative of a more exter-
nal LoC. As LoC needed to be assessed before and
after photo contemplation, the scale was split in half
by randomly allocating the items to either pre- or
poststimuli order. To equate the number of items pre
and post, the paired statements "the idea that teach-
ers are unfair to students is nonsense" and "most
students don't realize the extent to which their
grades are influenced by accidental happenings"
were removed. This pair was chosen for exclusion
because it was felt that responses may be skewed in
the student sample.
4. Anticipation of Threat (AoT; Corcoran et al., 2006) is
a seven-item self-report scale, with acceptable inter-
nal reliability ( = 0.78) measuring the extent to
which respondents anticipate encountering certain
threatening acts over the next week using a 7-point
scale. As AoT needed to be assessed before and after
photo contemplation, the scale was split in half by
randomly allocating the items to either pre- or post-
stimuli order. To equate the number of items pre and
post photo contemplation, the item "Your mail is read
without your permission" was removed.
5. Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFC;
Strathman et al., 1994) is a 12-item scale used to
measure the extent to which people regard immediate
versus distant consequences of their behavior as more
important. A high score indicates less consideration
of the future. Respondents rate how characteristic of
them each statement is using a 5-point scale. The
authors report internal reliability ranging from  =
0.80 to 0.86. As CFC needed to be assessed before
and after photo contemplation, it was split in half by
randomly allocating the items to either pre- or post-
stimuli order.
Photo Contemplation Questions
The photograph contemplation task was undertaken after
participants had completed the first half of the LoC, AoT,
and CFC measures. Participants were asked to respond using

place mix with each other on friendly terms?
4. How much antisocial behavior (e.g., smashed bus
shelters, fly tipping, burnt out cars) would you expect
to see in this area?
5. How poor or rich do you think the people who live in
this place are?
Analysis Strategy
In both studies, the following three-step approach to data
analysis was taken:
1. Pearson's correlations were used to explore the rela-
tionship between the measures of paranoid ideation,
depression, and anxiety (PaDS and DASS) and the
pre-stimuli measures of LoC, AoT, and CFC to deter-
mine their level of association in these samples.
2. Paired samples t tests were used to compare pre- and
postcontemplation levels of self-reported LoC, AoT,
and CFC regardless of image type. For each of these
measures, a pre­post stimuli difference score was
computed. These new variables were subjected to
independent samples t tests to establish whether con-
templation of the different images was associated
with greater or lesser difference scores.
3. Finally, depending on the outcome of Step 2, hierar-
chical regression would explore the extent to which
the change in psychological mechanisms following
the contemplation of images was independently
related to DASS and PaDS scores and image type.
Results
Study A: Urban Versus Rural Places
The relationship between DASS and PaDS scores and prestimuli
LoC, AoT, and CFC.Confirming the established findings of
previous literature, Table 2 shows the statistically significant
correlations between the measures of paranoia, depression,
and anxiety with prestimuli LoC, AoT, and CFC.
Photograph Contemplation Effects
Table 3 shows the means (±SD) for the urban and rural
images for pre- and poststimuli LoC, AoT, and CFC. Paired
samples t tests demonstrated that all of these measures
changed significantly after the contemplation of both types
of photograph. Contemplating place photographs was asso-
ciated with feeling significantly less in control of life, antici-
pating significantly more threat in the near future and
reporting less consideration of the future, LoC: t(316) =
-8.98, p < .001, one-tailed; AoT: t(316) = -22.36, p < .001,
one-tailed, CFC: t(316) = -8.69, p < .001, one-tailed.
Analyses of the mean difference scores demonstrated that
the contemplation of the urban places did not augment exter-
nal LoC, AoT, or reduce CFC significantly more than the
contemplation of rural places (LoC: urban, M = .88, SD =
1.62; rural, M = .72, SD = 1.56), t(315) = .93, p = .176; d =
.10, one-tailed; (AoT: urban, M = 4.58, SD = 3.92; rural, M =
4.74, SD = 3.49), t(315) = -.37, p = .355, d = .04, one-tailed;
(CFC: urban, M = 1.83, SD = 3.55; rural, M = 1.81, SD =
3.92), t(315) = .06, p = .475, d = .01, one-tailed.
Figure 1 shows the mean difference scores between pre
and post contemplation for both urban and rural residential
images for LoC, AoT, and CFC. These nonsignificant differ-
ences between image type meant that Step 3 of the analyses
was unnecessary.
Study B: Desirable Versus Undesirable Places
The relationship between DASS and PaDS scores and prestimuli
LoC, AoT, and CFC.Confirming the established findings of
previous literature and those from the urban versus rural
study, Table 2 shows the statistically significant correlations
between the measures of paranoid ideation, depression, and
anxiety with preprime psychological processes (LoC, AoT,
and CFC).

Photograph Contemplation Effects
Table 3 shows the means (±SD) for the more and less
desirable images for pre- and postcontemplation LoC,
AoT, and CFC. Paired samples t tests demonstrated that
all of these measures changed significantly following the
contemplation of both types of place image. Contemplating
the photographs was associated with feeling significantly
less in control of their lives, anticipating significantly
more threat in the near future and reported considering the
future significantly less, LoC: t(297) = -7.26, p < .001,
one-tailed; AoT: t(297) = -22.21, p < .001, one-tailed;
CFC: t(297) = -6.66, p < .001.
Analyses of the mean difference scores demonstrated that
the contemplation of the less desirable neighborhoods did
not increase external LoC significantly more than the con-
templation of the more desirable neighborhoods (more desir-
able: M = .45, SD = 1.26; less desirable: M = .66, SD = 1.39),
t(296) = -1.40, p = .082, d = -.16 (one-tailed). Furthermore,
the less desirable neighborhoods did not significantly alter
CFC more than the more desirable neighborhoods (more
desirable: M = 1.35, SD = 3.61; less desirable: M = 1.41, SD
= 3.56), t(296) = -.15, p = .443, d = -.02 (one-tailed).
However, contemplation of the less desirable neighborhoods
was associated with significantly greater change between
pre- and post-contemplation AoT scores compared with the
more desirable neighborhoods (more desirable: M = 4.36,
SD = 3.73; less desirable: M = 5.35, SD = 3.80),
t(296) = -2.26, p = .012, d = .26 (one-tailed).
Figure 2 shows the mean difference scores between pre
and post contemplation for both the more and less desirable
residential neighborhoods for LoC, AoT, and CFC.
Exploring the Change in AoT: Mental Health and
Image Type Effects
As no significant differences in change to LoC or CFC by
image type were found, regression analysis exploring the
effects of paranoid ideation, depression, and anxiety and
image type on mean difference scores was limited to AoT.
A hierarchical regression with postcontemplation AoT
score as the dependent variable explored the extent to which
the relative change in AoT was independently predicted by
participant's underlying levels of depression/anxiety, para-
noid ideation, and place type. Step 1 of the hierarchical
regression included sex and precontemplation AoT scores.
Step 2 added PaDS and DASS scores, and finally, Step 3 of
the model added image type (more/less desirable residential
neighborhoods). The overall regression model predicted
approximately 30% of variance in postcontemplation AoT
scores, R2 = .30, F(5, 292) = 25.56, p < .001. Sex and precon-
templation AoT scores predicted approximately 16% of vari-
ance in postcontemplationAoT scores with precontemplation
AoT but not sex having significant beta values. Independent
of the significant effect of precontemplation AoT score,
PaDS and DASS scores predicted an additional 14% of vari-
ance in postcontemplation AoT. Finally, image type (more/
less desirable places) predicted a further 1% of variance of

Discussion
The research reported above agrees with the findings of stud-
ies conducted by Ellett et al. (2008) and Nettle et al. (2014)
by showing that even very brief exposure to particular places
is associated with changes to psychology that could underpin
the urbanicity effect. Furthermore, it strengthens the argu-
ment about the rapidity of this psychological response by
using the approach of Liu et al.(2012) where only photo-
graphs were used to elicit the effects of place contemplation
on psychological mechanisms. StudyAaimed to explore bio-
philic explanations of the urbanicity effect by examining
whether very brief contemplation of neighborhoods per-
ceived to be urban produced changes in LoC, AoT, and CFC
while neighborhoods perceived to be rural did not.
Unexpectedly, the results indicated that significant change to
all the mechanisms occurred after contemplating both the
rural and urban photographs with participants feeling signifi-
cantly less in control of their lives, anticipating significantly
more threat and reporting less consideration of the future.
However, when comparing pre- and postcontemplation dif-
ference scores by photo type, no significant differences were
found. These findings indicate that post-contemplation
changes to these psychological mechanisms cannot be
explained by the perceived urbanity of places and so are not
consistent with biophilic interpretations of the urbanicity
effect.
In Study B, we explored whether very brief contempla-
tion of residential neighborhoods considered to be relatively
undesirable would produce changes in LoC, AoT, and CFC
while residential places considered to be relatively desirable
would not. Replicating the urban versus rural findings, we
found that all psychological mechanisms changed signifi-
cantly following the contemplation of place images
irrespective of type, with participants feeling significantly
less in control of their lives, anticipating significantly more
threat and considering the future significantly less. Of the
three psychological mechanisms considered, only the change
to AoT was significantly associated with the contemplation
of less desirable places. Furthermore, in a hierarchical regres-
sion, image type was found to be a significant independent
predictor of post-contemplation AoT after controlling for the
other influential independent variables (i.e., pre-contempla-
tion AoT, DASS, and PaDS scores). Thus, while the hypoth-
esis that brief contemplation of urban photos would be
associated with changes to self-reported psychological
mechanisms to a greater extent than the contemplation of
rural images was not supported, the hypothesis that brief
contemplation of less desirable residential neighborhoods
would be associated with changes in psychological mecha-
nisms more than contemplation of more desirable residential
neighborhoods was partially supported. Specifically, brief
contemplation of relatively undesirable neighborhoods
enhanced a sense of threat to the self in the future. Therefore,
findings using this paradigm suggest that the perceived desir-
ability of place is a better potential explanation of the urban-
icity effect than the perceived urbanity of place.
We also predicted that the extent of post-contemplation
changes to psychology would be related to higher self-
reported levels of depression/anxiety and paranoid ideation.
Full support for this hypothesis was found in relation to AoT
in Study B. Consistent with previous literature showing that
symptoms of depression, anxiety,, and paranoia are associ-
ated with the anticipation of more negative and threatening
events (Abler et al., 2007; Bennett & Corcoran, 2010; Bentall
et al., 2009; Corcoran et al., 2006; Kaney et al., 1997;
Kellough et al., 2008; MacLeod et al., 1986; Moutoussis
et al., 2007; Paulus & Yu, 2012; Strunk & Adler, 2009), we
found that higher levels of depression, anxiety, and paranoia
predicted more change in AoT after image contemplation.
However, it is important to stress that image type accounted
for additional variance in post-contemplation AoT beyond

Undesirable) as Predictors of Postcontemplation AoT.

the effects of preexisting levels of mental health symptoms.
Thus, levels of self-reported mental health and perceived
desirability are dissociable in terms of how they relate to
individuals' psychological response to places.
While the nonsignificant differences found between the
contemplation of urban compared with rural residential
neighborhoods do not support interpretations of the urbanic-
ity effect that are premised upon biophilic preferences, the
current findings do support research highlighting the delete-
rious effects of physical and social characteristics of place
(Ellaway et al., 2001; Ellaway et al., 2009; Evans, 2003;
Weich et al., 2006).
Contrary to expectations, we found in both studies that the
prompted contemplation of all place images was robustly
associated with the report of significantly less sense of con-
trol, the anticipation of significantly more threat, and the
report of reduced consideration of the future. While unex-
pected, these general place contemplation findings might be
explained by the effects of uncontrolled variables, such as
SES and/or generic aspects of the study design. For example,
it has been found that people with lower SES perceive more
threat and less control generally (Chen & Paterson, 2006).
Although it is unlikely to account for the findings in this
study involving university students, future research should
certainly take into account self-reported SES and area of
residence to address criticisms premised upon "mere expo-
sure" effects (Zajonc, 1968). In terms of generic aspects of
study design, it is possible that the contemplation changes
found across all photo types resulted from unavoidable order
effects associated with measuring variables pre and post
stimuli. However, we consider that the most likely explana-
tion for this generic finding is related to the type of questions
used to prompt active contemplation. These focused on spe-
cific judgments about the nature of the people who may live
in these places. As such, these social-psychological prompts
may have elicited negative changes in social self-perspec-
tive. Even so, the augmented contemplation effect of AoT
associated with the less desirable residential images existed
over and above these general place contemplation effects.
Although we consider the active contemplation aspect of this
research design to be a positive feature as it is likely to mimic
an everyday consideration of places, future research could
explore the overall explanatory role of the prompted contem-
plation by presenting the photographs without the questions
in a pure priming methodology.
The educational status, age, sex, and ethnicity bias of our
sample limits the generalizability of these findings. Most
importantly, the predominantly undergraduate samples are
likely to be socioeconomically skewed. The fact that females
have been found to be more vulnerable to urbanicity effects
(Sundquist et al., 2004) is also important to note but the hier-
archical analyses conducted here did not find sex to be a sig-
nificant predictor of postcontemplation AoT (see Table 4).
While this study is important because it demonstrates that
even a brief simulated immersion in place can result in
significant changes in self-reflection, the ecological validity
of a lab-based study using static photographs of place is low.
Future research could build ecological validity by tracking
participant's responses as they move through contrasting
urban environments.
These studies have demonstrated that brief, simulated
contemplation of place photographs can change the way we
think about ourselves within the social world. Furthermore,
it has shown that levels of mental health and well-being are
related to specific psychological responses to different envi-
ronments thus helping us to understand the urbanicity effect.
This kind of research has potential to add an important
dimension to the evidence base that informs the future devel-
opment of our cities and neighborhoods with the aim of mak-
ing them better living environments.
