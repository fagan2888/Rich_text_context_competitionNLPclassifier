Introduction
Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, is used clinically as an
immunosuppressive agent to reduce the rejection rate in
organ transplantation.1­4 As compared with cyclosporine,
tacrolimus treatment seems to induce fewer hemodynamic
and fibrogenic effects but the resultant nephrotoxicity
remains a serious problem.5­8 In renal transplant biopsies,
almost similar histopathological injuries have been reported
with cyclosporine and tacrolimus-treated patients, suggest-
ing that tacrolimus in the long term results in the same
structural damage as cyclosporine.9
The mechanism of tacrolimus-induced acute nephro-
toxicity is still unclear. Previous literature suggests that the
ability of tacrolimus to produce reactive oxygen species
(ROS) via activation of NADPH oxidase pathway and
cause disturbance in antioxidant defense may be responsi-
ble for renal toxicity.10 Several studies suggest that the
renin­angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in the
regulation of blood pressure (BP), volume homeostasis
and development of cardiac hypertrophy, failure and reper-
fusion injury.11,12 Subsequently, its importance in renal
failure has also been recognized and it has been established
that inhibition of RAS is an effective way to intervene with
the pathogenesis of these disorders.13­15 It is reported that
treatment with tacrolimus leads to impairment in RAS. It
has been shown previously that tacrolimus treatment sig-
nificantly increases blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum
creatinine level, while it decreases endogenous creatinine

Abstract
Introduction: Tacrolimus is frequently used as immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation but its clinical use is
limited due to its marked nephrotoxicity.
Materials and methods: Male Wistar albino rats weighing 150­200 g (10­12 weeks old) were used. Animals were
divided into four groups. Group 1 served as control group and received normal saline, group 2 served as toxic group and
received 2 mg/kg tacrolimus i.p., group 3 served as treatment group and received 2 mg/kg tacrolimus i.p. followed by 2
mg/kg aliskiren orally and group 4 served as drug per se group and received 2 mg/kg aliskiren orally. Tacrolimus-induced
nephrotoxicity was assessed biochemically and histopathologically.
Results: Treatment with aliskiren decreased the tacrolimus-induced changes in biochemical markers of nephrotoxicity
such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Aliskiren also attenuated the effects of tacrolimus on oxidative stress
parameters such as malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione and catalase. Histopathological and ultrastructural studies
showed that aliskiren attenuated tacrolimus-induced renal damage.
Conclusion: These results suggest that aliskiren has protective effects against tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity;
implying that renin inhibitor may counteract nephrotic syndrome associated with immunosuppressant use.

clearance and is inversely proportional to plasma renin
activity. The rise in plasma renin activity significantly cor-
relates with the increase in fractional excretion of Na.16,17
Similarly, renin mRNA levels are also increased in the
renal cortex in tacrolimus-treated rats.18 All these studies
suggest that tacrolimus disturbs the RAS and is also asso-
ciated with increased oxidative stress.
Aliskiren (ALK) is the first clinically used orally active
renin inhibitor, which selectively inhibits renin enzymatic
activity without affecting other systems.19,20 ALK attenu-
ates gentamicin-induced nephropathy by suppression of
inflammatory, profibrotic and apoptotic factors through
inhibition of the nuclear factor and mitogen-activated pro-
tein kinase signaling pathways.20 Direct renin inhibition
with ALK prevents intra-renal RAS activation, leading to
mitigation in the development of glomerulonephritis.21
Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing renin show dis-
appearance of podocyte foot processes as well as perivas-
cular and peri-glomerular inflammation in the kidney and
these changes are reversed by treatment with AT1 receptor
antagonist.22 Based on these studies we hypothesized that
ALK may reduce/attenuate tacrolimus-induced renal dam-
age and oxidative stress through renin inhibition. Therefore,
the present study was designed to investigate the effect of
ALK on tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity in rats using
biochemical markers of oxidative stress and renal function,
and histopathological measures of cellular damage.
Materials and methods
Animal model
In this study male Wistar albino rats weighing 150­200 g
(10­12 weeks old) were used. The animals were obtained
from Experimental Animal Care Center, College of
Pharmacy at King Saud University. They were housed
under ideal laboratory conditions (12 h light/12 h darkness
cycle, 45­55% relative humidity and temperature 23­
25°C), maintained on standard pellet diet and water ad
libitum throughout the experimental period. All experi-
ments were carried out according to the guidelines of the
Animal Care and Use Committee at King Saud University.
Drugs and chemicals
Tacrolimus from Sigma Aldrich, USA and aliskiren from
Novartis Ltd were used in the study. Biochemical param-
eters were done using kits (Dimension, Siemens, USA).
All of the other chemicals used were of analytical grade.
Experimental protocol
Rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1,
control group, received normal saline for 14 days. Group
2, toxic group, received tacrolimus (2 mg/kg, intraperito-
neally (i.p.)) for 14 days.23 Group 3, treatment group,
received tacrolimus (2 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14 days similarly to
group 2, and also ALK [(50 mg/kg, dissolved in distilled
water administered per os (p.o.)] for 28 days.24 Group 4,
drug per se group, received ALK (50 mg/kg, dissolved in
distilled water administered p.o.) for 28 days.24
Tacrolimus administration (in group 2 and 3) started on
day 15 and was continued till the end of the study. All the
rats were sacrificed at the end of the study by decapitation
under ether anesthesia, as per the protocol. Blood samples
were collected followed by serum separation at 3000 g for
10 min. Samples were then kept at ­20 ºC until analysis of
renal function parameters.
The rats' kidneys were isolated and washed in ice cold
physiological saline and used for assessment of oxidative
stress, histopathology and ultrastructural changes.
Biochemical estimation
Biochemical estimations were done by autoanalyzer
(Dimension RXL MAX, Siemens, USA).
Determination of lipid peroxides, measured as
malondialdehyde (MDA)
The level of MDA, a product of membrane lipid peroxida-
tion, was estimated by reacting it with thiobarbituric acid
(TBA), by the method of Okhawa et al.,25 using the standard
calibration curve prepared from tetraethoxy propane. MDA
was expressed as nmoles of MDAper mg of protein. Protein
was estimated by the method of Lowry et al.26
Determination of reduced glutathione (GSH)
GSH content was estimated by the method of Sedlack and
Lindsay.27 The absorbance of reaction mixture as read within
5 min of addition of dithibis-2-nitrobenzoic acid at 412 nm
using a UV-spectrophotometer, against a reagent blank.
Determination of catalase (CAT)
Kidney tissue was homogenized and post-mitochondrial
supernatant (PMS) was used to assay CAT activity. CAT
activity was estimated using the method of Claiborne.28
The reaction mixture consisted of 1.95 ml of phosphate
buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), 1.0 ml of hydrogen peroxide (0.019
M) and 0.05 ml of PMS in a final volume of 3 ml. Changes
in absorbance were recorded at 240 nm every minute for 5
min. The enzyme activity was calculated as nmoles of
H2
O2
consumed/min/mg protein.
Histopathological studies
Kidneys were harvested from the rats and fixed in 10%
buffer formosaline. Paraffin sections of thickness 3­4 m
were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
Al-Harbi et al. 1331
(H&E) for histopathological examination under light
microscopy.29
Ultrastructural studies
Immediately after removal of kidney from the dissected
rats, tissues were sliced into small size (1 mm³) and fixed
in 3% buffered glutaraldehyde. Tissue specimens were
then post fixed in 1% osmium tetaroxide (OsO4
) for 90
min. Dehydration of the fixed tissue was performed using
ascending grades of ethanol followed by transfer of tissue
to epoxy resin via propylene oxide. After impregnation
with the pure resin (SPI Resin), tissue specimens were
embedded in the same resin mixture.31 Ultra-thin sections
of silver shades (60­70 nm) were cut using an ultra-
microtome (Leica, UCT, Tokyo, Japan) with a diamond
knife; sections were then placed on copper grids and
stained with uranyl acetate (20 min) and lead citrate (5
min). Stained sections were observed under Transmission
Electron Microscopy (JEOL JEM-1011Tokyo, Japan)
operating at 80 kV.30­32
Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean±standard error of the
mean (SEM). Comparisons among different groups were
analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test to identify sig-
nificance among groups. Values were considered statisti-
cally significant when p<0.05. Statistical analysis was
carried out using GraphPad Prism 3.0.
Results
Effects of ALK on tacrolimus-induced
parameters of renal function in serum
In this study, two weeks of treatment of rats resulted in
tacrolimus-induced renal damage as evidenced by a sig-
nificant (p<0.05) increase in serum creatinine and BUN
levels as compared to the control group. Treatment with
ALK significantly (p<0.05) decreased both serum creati-
nine and BUN levels compared to the toxic group. A sig-
nificant (p<0.05) decrease in serum total protein and
albumin was seen in the toxic group which was reversed
by treatment with ALK. the drug group per se had no sig-
nificant changes in any of parameters compared to control
group (Table 1).
Effects of ALK on tacrolimus-induced
parameters of oxidative stress in kidney
The results are summarized in Figure 1­3. Two weeks
treatments of rats with tacrolimus (2 mg/kg) resulted in a
significant (p<0.05) increase in kidney MDA contents
compared to the control group. Treatment with ALK
showed a significant (p<0.05) decrease in tacrolimus-
induced kidney MDA level (Figure 1). Consequently, a
significant (p<0.05) decrease in kidney GSH level (Figure
2) and catalase activity (Figure 3) was found in tacrolimus-
treated rats as compared to the control group. Treatment
with ALK showed a significant increase in tacrolimus-
induced kidney GSH level (p<0.05) and catalase activity
(p<0.05). The drug per se group had no significant changes
in any of parameters compared to control group.
Effects of ALK on tacrolimus-induced
parameters of histopathological changes in
kidney
Normal morphological structures of renal tissue were seen
in the control group (Figure 4a). However two weeks treat-
ment with tacrolimus resulted in hypertrophy of epithelial
cells and renal tubules epithelia degeneration. The dilatation
of capillaries filled with erythrocytes was the most advanced
change all over the kidney. Renal glomeruli and epithelial
cell enlargement in the cortical part of the kidney were also
observed. In a few renal tubules, single epithelial cells des-
quamated from the lumen were also noted (Figure 4b). Four
weeks treatment with ALK ameliorated tacrolimus-induced
damage in renal tissue to that observed in normal tissue
(Figure 4c). No morphological changes were observed in
the drug per se group (Figure 4d).

studies. At ultra-structural level, normal structures of kid-
ney were seen in the control group (Figure 5a). By con-
trast, nephropathic changes were observed in the
cortico-medullary region of the toxic group which were
characterized by glomerular damage, including dilatation
of glomerular blood vessels, exfoliation and shedding of
proximal tubular cells into the tubular lumen, thickened
basement membrane, and interstitial inflammation (Figure
5b). Cellular damage was accompanied by `scarring' of
some glomeruli (focal glomerular sclerosis) and tubules
(tubular interstitial fibrosis), as well as by tubular regen-
eration (Figure 5b). We also noticed degenerated mito-
chondria, numbers of multi-vesicle bodies, glomerular
epithelial injury, and cell debris. Under normal conditions,
tubular regeneration serves to restore the loss of damaged
cells by a transient increase of cell proliferation. However,
in ALK-treated rats, the kidneys demonstrated massive
and sustained regenerative renal cell proliferation, result-
ing in simple tubular hyperplasia, indicated by a broad
increase of cell number and multilayered tubules. ALK
treatment was associated with normalization of the tacroli-
mus-induced renal cell damage and the treated rats showed
normal cellular features (Figure 5c). Normal cellular struc-
tures were observed in the drug per se group (Figure 5d).
Discussion
ALK is one of a new class of orally active agents which
selectively inhibits renin enzymatic activity without affect-
ing other systems involved in cardiovascular regulation.
Recently, in some studies, the protective effects of ALK on
nephrotoxicity were evaluated using animal models (acute
murine model)33 or drugs (such as gentamycin and doxoru-
bicin).19,34 The concentration of creatinine and BUN
depend on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Renal dys-
function reduces glomerular filtration of creatinine and
BUN, and thus levels of creatinine and BUN rise. If the
serum creatinine and BUN levels double, the GFR is con-
sidered to have been halved.34,35 Previous reports have
confirmed that tacrolimus-induced nephropathy is mani-
fested by elevation in the serum levels of creatinine and
BUN.19,34,36,37 In the present study, tacrolimus-treated rats
showed elevated levels of serum creatinine and BUN.
However, treatment with ALK caused a significant reduc-
tion in creatinine and BUN levels which may be due to
improvement in glomerular filtration damage induced by
tacrolimus. These results are in agreement with an earlier
report.38 Hypo-albuminemia is a characteristic feature of
the nephrotic syndrome.39 In this study, serum albumin

level was found to be low in tacrolimus-treated rats, simi-
lar to the findings of previous studies.40­42 Treatment with
ALK reversed tacrolimus-induced hypo-albuminemia.38
Therefore, it is suggested that ALK improves renal func-
tion by counteracting tacrolimus-induced nephropathy.
In our study, we observed a significant increase in the
concentration of MDA level in renal tissues of tacrolimus-
treated animals as compared to the control group. The
elevated level of MDA may be due to enhanced production
of ROS (superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide and
hydroxyl radicals). Ibrahim et al., also reported a signifi-
cant increase in kidney MDA content in rats with a cumu-
lative dose of tacrolimus.33 Similar studies were also
reported by other authors.43,44 Zhou et al., in 2004, reported
that tacrolimus enhanced production of ROS leading to
cell death.17 In this study, treatment withALK significantly
decreased renal MDA level which suggests its role in com-
bating oxidative stress generated by tacrolimus. As MDA
is a secondary product of lipid peroxidation of unsaturated
fatty acids, its decrease by ALK could be taken as an index
for decreased oxidative stress and subsequent reduction in
cytotoxicity.45
Tissue GSH depletion is one of the primary factors
which permit lipid peroxidation.46 The decreased CAT
activity in renal tissue may be due to excess production of
superoxide and hydrogen peroxide which promote lipid
peroxide formation. In the present study, administration of
tacrolimus decreased GSH level and CAT activity as com-
pared to the control group, while treatment with ALK
reversed the tacrolimus-induced decrease in renal GSH
content and CAT activity. Increased intracellular GSH
content and CAT activity might be due to up-regulation of
enzymatic/nonenzymatic antioxidants or decreased ROS
production in the ALK-treated group. ALK has been
shown to decrease oxidative stress in earlier studies.47,48
In histopathological examination of the toxic group, the
epithelia of the renal tubules show degeneration with infil-
tration of mononuclear cells, dilation of glomeruli as well

as hyperemia of medullary and cortical parts. The dilata-
tion of capillaries filled with erythrocytes was the most
advanced change all over the kidney. Further, the present
study showed tubular vacuolization in toxic group.
Examination of the renal cellular ultrastructure showed
round, oval mitochondria within the tubular epithelium in
tacrolimus-treated rats. Further ultrastructural analysis
showed disturbances in podocyte foot processes i.e. podo-
cyte foot injury and podocyte foot process effacement.
Similar histopathological and ultrastructural changes are
associated with tacrolimus-related nephrotoxicity, includ-
ing tubular vacuolisation, arteriolar hyalinosis, interstitial
fibrosis and juxtaglomerular hyperplasia which have been
reported earlier.38,49­52 Tacrolimus-induced histopathologi-
cal and ultrastructural changes were reversed by treatment
with ALK. There was restoration of podocyte architecture
along with epithelial integrity after treatment with ALK.
Tubular vacuolization induced by tacrolimus was also
attenuated by treatment with ALK. Earlier studies have
shown that RAS blockade leads to preservation of podo-
cyte architecture, mitochondrial function and epithelial
integrity.22,47,53
Some additional parameters like measurement of blood
pressure and plasma renin activity would have further
strengthened our findings, however these could not be
measured and this is a limitation of the current study.
Treatment with ALK ameliorated tacrolimus-induced
nephrotoxicity implying that renin inhibition leads to
improvement in renal function. The protective effect ofALK
was accompanied by a significant attenuation of oxidative
stress parameters in kidney (MDA, GSH and CAT), improve-
ment in renal function biochemistry in serum as well as res-
toration of renal structures as observed by histopathological
and ultrastructural findings. Thus, the current study suggests
that ALK treatment may protect against nephrotic syndrome
associated with immunosuppressant use.
