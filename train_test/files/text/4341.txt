Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effect of intranasal ketamine versus alfentanil in addition to oral
midazolam for the prevention of emergence agitation in children.
Methods: Children undergoing urological surgery with sevoflurane anaesthesia received oral
midazolam 40 min before induction and were then randomly assigned to receive 2 mg/kg ketamine,
10 mg/kg alfentanil or 1 ml isotonic saline intranasally. Parental separation status and mask
acceptance were assessed preoperatively. Emergence agitation was evaluated using a paediatric
anaesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) score.
Results: Data from 78 children were evaluated in the study. There were no significant differences
between the groups in demographic characteristics, recovery times or parental separation scores.
Mask acceptance was significantly better in the ketamine group than in the saline group. The mean
PAED score in the ketamine group was significantly better than in the other two groups, but was
similar in the saline and alfentanil groups. The incidence of emergence agitation was 3.8%, 36.0%
and 40.7% in the ketamine, alfentanil and saline groups, respectively.
Conclusions: The addition of intranasal ketamine to oral midazolam significantly improved the
quality of induction and reduced sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation, in children undergoing
urological surgery.

Introduction
Anaesthesia induction with sevoflurane is
frequently used in children. Although sevo-
flurane is a popular, well-accepted and easily
manageable anaesthetic for the induction
and maintenance of anaesthesia (in addition
to having a good safety profile), recovery
may be complicated by emergence agitation
in paediatric patients, even in the absence of
surgery.1 Cravero et al.1 reported that,
depending on whether a high or low thresh-
old was used to define agitation, 33% or
80%, respectively, of patients receiving
sevoflurane anaesthesia developed emer-
gence delirium.
Several studies have evaluated the ability
of premedication to decrease the incidence
of emergence agitation. Midazolam is the
most frequently used premedication drug in
paediatric patients;2­4 however, there are
ongoing debates concerning its efficacy in
preventing emergence agitation.5 Ketamine
and alfentanil are other premedication drugs
that are used in paediatric patients.6­8
Combining different premedication drugs
has offered promising results in terms of
improved sedation scores and anxiolysis.9,10
The present study evaluated the effects on
emergence agitation of adding intranasal
ketamine or intranasal alfentanil to oral
midazolam as premedication in children
undergoing urological surgery.
Patients and methods
Patients
Children aged between 1 and 8 years
undergoing general anaesthesia with sevo-
flurane for urological surgical procedures at
Yeditepe University Hospital, Istanbul,
Turkey, between February and August 2012,
who were American Society of
Anesthesiologist status I­II, were enrolled in
the study. Exclusion criteria included cardiac,
pulmonary, hepatic or renal disease, and
psychological or emotional disorders.
Written informed parental consent was
obtained for all study participants. The
study was registered with the Clinical
Trials.gov protocol registration system
(NCT02022488) and was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Yeditepe University
Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.
Premedication and anaesthesia
All patients received oral midazolam
0.5 mg/kg as preanaesthetic medication
$40 min before the induction of anaesthesia.
Children were randomly assigned to one of
three groups using a computer-generated
random number table by an anaesthesiolo-
gist who did not participate in the study.
Children in the ketamine group (group MK)
received 2 mg/kg ketamine intranasally,
those in the alfentanil group (group MA)
received 10 mg/kg alfentanil intranasally and
those in the saline group (group MS)
received 1 ml isotonic saline intranasally,
8­10 min before the induction of anaesthe-
sia. The intranasal drugs were given while
patients were in the supine position; if the
volume of drug required exceeded 1 ml, the
dose was divided between both nostrils.
Each patient's parents, the anaesthesiolo-
gists (with the exception of S.B.), the statis-
tician and all observers were blinded to the
study groups.
Heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure
and oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry
were routinely monitored and recorded
before anaesthesia induction and every
5 min during surgery. Anaesthesia was
Bilgen et al. 1263
induced with 7% sevoflurane and 60%
nitrous oxide in oxygen, then maintained
with 0.75 minimum alveolar concentration
of sevoflurane in 60% nitrous oxide in
oxygen. After anaesthesia induction and
intravenous cannulation, a laryngeal mask
airway was inserted. Before the first surgical
incision, caudal block was performed using
0.25% bupivacaine at a dose of 0.8 ml/kg.
Adequacy of caudal block was assessed with
the absence of an increase in heart rate with
the skin incision; the block was deemed
inadequate if the heart rate increased > 20%
within 60 s of the incision. At the end of
surgery, inhaled agents were discontinued
and the oxygen concentration was increased
to 100%.
Patient evaluation
For each patient, age, weight, duration of
surgery and anaesthesia, and spontaneous
eye opening time (emergence duration) were
recorded.
Parental separation status was measured
in the preoperative period using a four-point
scale (1, asleep; 2, good separation, awake,
calm; 3, awake, anxious, can be easily
reassured; 4, crying, cannot be reassured).11
Similarly, a four-point scale was also used to
assess the ease of mask acceptance
(1, excellent ­ asleep or awake, calm,
co-operative, accepting mask; 2, slight fear
but can be easily reassured; 3, moderate fear,
reassured with difficulty; 4, crying, needs
restraint).11
Emergence agitation was measured using
a paediatric anaesthesia emergence delirium
(PAED) score,12 in which five attributes (the
child makes eye contact with the caregiver;
the child's actions are purposeful; the child is
aware of the surroundings; the child is
restless; the child is inconsolable) are
scored between 0 and 4. Eye contact, pur-
poseful actions and awareness of surround-
ings were scored as: 0, extremely; 1, very
much; 2, quite a bit; 3, just a little; 4, not at
all. Restlessness and inconsolability were
scored as: 0, not at all; 1, just a little; 2, quite
a bit; 3, very much; 4, extremely. The
maximum score overall is 20. The degree of
agitation was recorded at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60
and 120 min after entering the postanaesthe-
sia care unit, and the highest recorded values
during the first 30 min and the following
90 min were used for evaluation. Patients
with a PAED score > 12 at any time during
the first 120 min postoperatively were con-
sidered to be agitated13 and were treated
with 1 mg/kg intravenous fentanyl.
At the same time points as the PAED
score was recorded, pain was assessed using
the Modified Children's Hospital of Eastern
Ontario Pain Scale (Modified CHEOPS),14
which is based on scores for cry, facial
expression, verbal expression and move-
ment. Each child with a pain score ! 4 was
treated with 1 mg/kg intravenous fentanyl in
the postanaesthesia care unit.
The modified Aldrete score15 was mea-
sured every 5 min to determine readiness for
discharge from the postanaesthesia care
unit, with a score of ! 9 being required for
discharge.
After discharge from the postanaesthesia
care unit, children with a Modified
CHEOPS score ! 4 or higher received oral
paracetamol at a dose of 15 mg/kg.
Adverse events s(including laryngos-
pasm, bronchospasm and postoperative
respiratory depression, hypoxaemia, and
nausea or vomiting) were noted. In addition,
the time to discharge from hospital was
recorded for each patient.
Statistical analyses
On the basis of reference data,5 G*Power
3.1.5 (http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html)
was used to calculate that a sample size of
28 would be needed in each group to detect a
25% difference in PAED scores with a
significance level of 0.05 and a power of
80% (one-sided test). Variables were
1264 Journal of International Medical Research 42(6)
analysed using the Kolmogorov­Smirnov
test to determine whether or not they were
normally distributed.
Data for continuous variables were pre-
sented as mean Æ SD. Data for categorical
variables were presented as frequencies and
percentages. 2-test was used to compare
categorical variables in the different groups.
One-way analysis of variance was used to
compare normally distributed variables
between groups. The Levene test was used
to assess the homogeneity of the variances.
When overall significance was observed,
pairwise post-hoc tests were performed
using Tukey's test. The Kruskall­Wallis
test was used to compare non-normally
distributed variables between the groups.
The Mann­Whitney U-test was performed
to test the significance of pairwise differences
using the Bonferroni correction to adjust for
multiple comparisons. A P-value < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
Apart from the calculation of sample size,
all statistical analyses were performed using
IBM SPSSÕ Statistics software, version 21
(IBM, Somers, NY, USA).

A total of 84 children were enrolled in the
study; six children were excluded due to

leaving 78 patients for evaluation. Of these,
26 were in group MK, 25 were in group MA
and 27 were in group MS. There were no
significant differences in age, weight, dur-
ation of surgery and anaesthesia or
emergence time between the three groups
(Table 1).
Parental separation scores were not sig-
nificantly different among the three groups
(Table 2). The mask acceptance score was
lower, indicating better acceptance, in group
MK compared with group MS (P ¼ 0.004);
all other differences in mask acceptance
score between the groups were not statistic-
ally significant (Table 2).
The highest PAED score during the first
30 min was significantly lower in group MK
than in group MS or group MA (P < 0.001
for both; Table 2), but there was no signifi-
cant difference between groups MS and MA
(Table 2). There were no significant differ-
ences between the groups in the highest
PAED score during the rest of the post-
operative period (Table 2). The number of
children with a PAED score > 12 during the
postoperative period was one (3.8%) in
group MK, nine (36.0%) in group MA and
11 (40.7%) in group MS. The frequency of
emergence agitation and subsequent fen-
tanyl use was significantly lower in group
MK compared with groups MA and MS
(P ¼ 0.004 for both) (Table 3).

Discussion
In the present study, addition of intranasal
ketamine to oral midazolam as a premedica-
tion significantly improved the quality of
anaesthetic induction and reduced sevoflur-
ane-induced emergence agitation, without
delaying emergence or affecting the time to
discharge from hospital.
A number of factors affect emergence
agitation, including: preoperative anxiety;16
pain;17 type of anaesthesia used.1,18
Although emergence agitation in children
after sevoflurane anaesthesia can occur in
those who are not in pain,1 postoperative
pain is a well-known contributing factor.17
In the present study, caudal analgesia
ensured that all participants were pain free.
The incidence of sevoflurane-induced
emergence agitation has been reported to
be 33­80%, with the wide range in incidence
being related to the definitions used.1
A number of scales have been devised to
evaluate emergence agitation in children.
The PAED scale has been shown to be
reliable and valid.12 In the present study,
patients were considered to be agitated if the
PAED score was > 12 at any time during the
postoperative period; using this definition,
the incidence of agitation was 3.8% in group
MK, 36.0% in group MA and 40.7% in
group MS.
Different strategies have been recom-
mended to decrease the incidence of emer-
gence agitation. The level of preoperative
anxiety has been shown to be related to
emergence delirium and postoperative
behavioural changes.16,19 Chorney and
Kain20 demonstrated that 42% of children
displayed distress during anaesthesia induc-
tion. Premedication is widely used in paedi-
atric patients in order to provide sedation,
reduce preoperative anxiety and improve the
quality of induction. Lapin et al.21 observed
that children anaesthetized with sevoflurane
without prior premedication had a 67%
incidence of postoperative agitation.
McMillan et al.22 demonstrated that
0.5 mg/kg midazolam orally was effective
premedication that offered a good safety
profile. In the present study, all three groups
were given 0.5 mg/kg midazolam orally.
Midazolam has been shown to provide
amnesia, reduce anxiety and decrease the

incidence of postoperative behavioural
changes.23 However, there is an ongoing
debate concerning its efficacy; some studies
have shown that it does not prevent emer-
gence agitation.24,25 The use of a single drug
may not be sufficient for the prevention of
emergence agitation;26 in such cases, treat-
ment with additional analgesics or sedatives
may be required. The serum concentration
of oral midazolam peaks at 53 min after oral
ingestion.27 Considering the length of the
operation and the time taken for patient
transfer, the sedation period of midazolam
may not cover the postoperative period and
therefore may not prevent emergence
agitation.
Several studies have evaluated the effects
on emergence agitation of combining mid-
azolam with other sedative drugs.10,22,28
Nasal administration of premedication
drugs may be an alternative route to intra-
venous, subcutaneous, oral or rectal admin-
istration in paediatric patients and may offer
advantages such as ease of administration
and rapid onset.6,29 In the present study, the
incidence of emergence agitation following
premedication with midazolam alone was
higher than when midazolam was combined
with intranasal ketamine.
Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor antagonist with opioid receptor
activity. It is highly lipid soluble and is
rapidly absorbed after intranasal adminis-
tration.7 Ketamine has been shown to be
effective in reducing anxiety only when
administered in combination with midazo-
lam.9 Warner et al.10 reported that a mid-
azolam/ketamine mixture is more effective
for parental separation and mask accept-
ance than midazolam or ketamine alone.
Weksler et al.6 reported that 6 mg/kg keta-
mine provides effective premedication in
children without delaying recovery time.
However, premedication with 3 mg/kg keta-
mine intranasally was reported to cause brief
desaturation periods in children.30 In the
present study, a low dose of nasal ketamine
was combined with midazolam to prevent
emergence agitation and minimize adverse
effects. The reason for the success of this
combination is probably related either to the
prolongation of the elimination half-life of
ketamine31 or a simple additive effect as a
result of the interaction between midazolam
and ketamine.28
Intranasal administration of fentanyl
during sevoflurane anaesthesia has been
reported to be associated with decreased
agitation, without an increase in the total
hospital stay.32 Alfentanil, a rapid- and
short-acting synthetic analogue of fentanyl,
appears to offer some clinically significant
advantages over fentanyl during outpatient
anaesthesia.33 The use of alfentanil is asso-
ciated with fewer intraoperative side effects,
such as respiratory depression and muscular
rigidity, and a more rapid recovery time
compared with fentanyl.33 The maximal
plasma concentration with intranasal alfen-
tanil is reached within 9 min and the elimin-
ation half-life is short.34 The short half-life
of nasal alfentanil may explain why it did
not prevent emergence agitation in the pre-
sent study. However, the terminal half-life of
nasal alfentanil (59.4 min) is similar to that
of intravenous alfentanil (60 min).34 The
administration of 10 mg/kg alfentanil intra-
venously after induction of anaesthesia in
children undergoing adenotonsillectomy
reduced the incidence of emergence agita-
tion without delaying the recovery time.35
Furthermore, the combination of midazo-
lam and alfentanil has been reported to
significantly decrease the expected median
effective dose required for hypnosis of both
drugs by 46%.36 In contrast, despite using a
dose of 10 mg/kg, alfentanil did not decrease
emergence agitation in the present study;
this is probably due to the reduced bioavail-
ability (64.9%) of alfentanil when given via
the nasal route.34
In the present study, nausea or vomiting
were more common in groups MA and MK
than in group MS, but these differences were
1268 Journal of International Medical Research 42(6)
not statistically significant. However, both
alfentanil and ketamine have the potential to
cause nausea and vomiting, which may
explain the numerically higher incidence
with the combination therapies, compared
with midazolam alone.
The present study has a number of limi-
tations. During the first 30 min of anaesthe-
sia emergence only three consecutive PAED
measurements were made, whereas other
studies have performed six measurements
within this time period. In the present study
children were continuously monitored in the
postanaesthesia care unit; the PAED score
was measured three times and the highest
value was used for statistical evaluation.
Another limitation is the lack of know-
ledge about changes in the median effective
doses of the drugs employed when used in
combination to control emergence agitation.
In conclusion, intranasal ketamine, in
addition to oral midazolam premedication,
significantly reduced sevoflurane-induced
emergence agitation without delaying emer-
gence or affecting the time to hospital
discharge, in children undergoing urosurgi-
cal procedures.
