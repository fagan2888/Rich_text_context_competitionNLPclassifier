Objective: To determine if the combination of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) explains an additional
component of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis risk than is accounted for by either anthropometric measure alone.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Participants: Participants were part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative sample of
Americans conducted from 1988 to 1994. The arthritis analyses included 15 570 participants aged 18 years and older. The knee
osteoarthritis analyses included 2323 participants aged 60 years and older. Body mass index and WC were measured in all
participants and classified into sex-specific tertiles.
Outcome measures: Arthritis (determined by self-report) and knee osteoarthritis (determined by radiograph).
Results: Independent of sex, the likelihood of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis increased in a graded fashion when moving from
the lowest to highest BMI tertile and when moving from the lowest to highest WC tertile (Ptrend
o0.01). In the next phase of
analyses, subjects were divided into WC tertiles within each of the BMI tertiles. Within the lowest BMI tertile, the likelihood of
arthritis and knee osteoarthritis was not different in the lowest, middle and highest WC tertiles (P40.1). Within the middle BMI
tertile, the middle and high WC tertiles were more likely to have knee osteoarthritis compared to the lowest WC tertile (Po0.05).
Within the highest BMI tertile, the highest WC tertile was more likely to have arthritis and knee osteoarthritis compared to the
lowest WC tertile (Po0.05).
Conclusions: Both BMI and WC were strong predictors of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis. When a categorical approach was
used for BMI and WC, similar to that in the clinical setting, independent effects of these anthropometric variables were observed.

Introduction
Obesity, as determined by the body mass index (BMI), is a
well-established risk factor for osteoarthritis, particularly
in the weight-bearing joints (see for reviews; Nevitt1 and
Eaton2). For instance, in Canada, obese individuals make up
23% of the adult population3 whereas 54% of the knee
replacement procedures are performed in obese individuals.4
Current obesity evaluation guidelines are that a combina-
tion of BMI and waist circumference (WC) be used to
determine obesity-associated health risk.5,6 That is, for a
given BMI category (normal weight, overweight or obese),
individuals with a high WC (X102 cm in men; X88 cm in
women) are considered to have a greater relative health risk
than individuals with a normal WC. These guidelines are
based on a growing body of evidence indicating that
abdominal obesity, as determined by WC, provides addi-
tional information on the risk for metabolic-related diseases
(type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, etc.) than is
obtained from BMI alone. In fact, research indicates that
WC is a stronger marker of metabolic health risk than BMI.7,8
Further research is required to determine if WC has a similar
effect on the vast array of other obesity-related health
problems, such as osteoarthritis.
A limited number of studies have considered the relation
between overall and abdominal obesity with osteoarthritis,
and the results of these studies are conflicting. In a study
of 1003 middle-aged women, Hart and Spector9 found that

BMI was a powerful predictor of osteoarthritis in a number of
joints, but that WC did not increase the predictive ability of
osteoarthritis after accounting for BMI. Similarly, in a sample
of 740 Caucasian men and women, Hochberg et al.10
reported a strong association of both BMI and WC with
knee osteoarthritis; however, WC was no longer a significant
predictor of knee osteoarthritis after adjusting for BMI.
Conversely, in another study based on the same cohort of
women, Hochberg et al.11 reported that although waist-to-
hip circumference ratio was a significant predictor of hand
osteoarthritis, BMI was not, suggesting that WC is a better
marker of osteoarthritis risk than BMI. To add even more
confusion, Davis et al.12 reported that neither BMI nor WC
was associated with osteoarthritis in the hands and feet in a
representative sample of American men and women from
1960 to 1962, except for women where WC was negatively
associated with hand osteoarthritis. More studies are needed
to clarify the independent and combined effects of BMI and
WC on arthritis and osteoarthritis risk.
The aim of the current study was to examine the relation
between BMI and WC with arthritis in a large representative
population of men and women. Our specific objective was to
determine if the combination of WC and BMI explains an
additional component of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis risk
than is predicted by either anthropometric measure alone.
Materials and methods
Study population
NHANES III was conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics in the United States to estimate the
prevalence of major diseases, nutritional disorders and risk
factors for these diseases.13 NHANES III was a nationally
representative, two-phase, 6-year cross-sectional survey
conducted from 1988 to 1994. The sampling plan used a
stratified, multistage, probability cluster design. The total
sample included 33 199 persons, and 18 163 of these
individuals were adults who completed both the home and
mobile examination center components of the survey that
were required for our analysis. Full details of the study design
and procedures are available elsewhere.13 Informed consent
was obtained from all the participants, and the protocol was
approved by the National Center for Health Statistics.
Although more recent NHANES surveys have been con-
ducted (1999­2004), these surveys did not obtain the
osteoarthritis measurements that were required for the
present study.
We excluded those who were o20 years of age, pregnant
women and subjects without height, weight, WC or arthritis
measures. This left a total of 7400 men and 8170 women
for analyses of arthritis in the current study. Because the
knee osteoarthritis measurements were obtained only in the
second phase (1991­1994) of NHANES III in those aged 60
years and above, the knee osteoarthritis outcome was limited
to 1104 men and 1219 women.
Study methods
Body mass index and waist circumference. Body weight and
height were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm,
respectively, using standardized equipment and proce-
dures.13,14 Body mass index was subsequently determined
as weight/height2 (kg/m2). The WC measurement was made
to the nearest 0.1 cm at minimal respiration at the level of
the iliac crest.13 Categories of BMI and WC were created
using gender-specific tertiles.
Arthritis. Presence of arthritis was determined by a positive
response to the question `Has your doctor ever told you that
you have arthritis?' Analysis by arthritis type (osteoarthritis,
rheumatoid arthritis) could not be performed because a large
percentage (57%) of the subjects with arthritis did not know
or did not report what type of arthritis they had. Of those
who reported the type of arthritis, 56% had osteoarthritis.
Knee osteoarthritis. Knee osteoarthritis was diagnosed by
knee radiographs performed in the mobile examination
center. Trained radiologists examined each of the non-
weight-bearing anteroposterior knee radiographs (knee in
extended position) for evidence of knee osteoarthritis. The
Kellgren­Lawrence atlas for knee osteoarthritis was used to
determine the presence of osteoarthritis in the joint.15 A
score of grade 2 or higher on Kellgren­Lawrence scale, which
is defined as definite presence of osteophytes, confirmed the
presence of osteoarthritis in the knee.15,16
Statistical analysis
In the initial set of analyses, logistic regression was used to
examine the independent and combined influence of
continuous BMI and WC measures on arthritis and knee
osteoarthritis. For this analysis, the odds ratios (OR) were
computed for each gender-specific standard deviation
change in BMI and WC.
The next set of analyses considered the association of BMI
alone and WC alone with arthritis and knee osteoarthritis
using a categorical approach for BMI and WC. This
categorical approach was employed because BMI and WC
are not used as continuous variables in the clinical setting. In
these analyses, logistic regression models were used to
examine the associations of BMI tertiles and WC tertiles
with arthritis and knee osteoarthritis. The lowest BMI tertile
and lowest WC tertile were used as the reference groups.
The final set of analyses considered the combined
influence of BMI and WC on arthritis and knee osteoarthritis
using a categorical approach for BMI and WC. Subjects were
initially divided into the three BMI tertiles. Within each BMI
tertile, logistic regression analysis was used to examine the
association of WC tertiles (which were specific for each BMI
tertile) with arthritis and knee osteoarthritis. Subjects were
then divided into the three WC tertiles, and within each WC
tertile logistic regression analysis was used to examine the
BMI, waist circumference and arthritis

association of BMI tertiles (which were specific for each WC
tertile) with arthritis and knee osteoarthritis.
All OR were adjusted for age, race and sex (except sex-
specific models). The Intercooled Stata 7 program (Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) was used to weight
the sample to be representative of the population, and to
take into account the NHANES III sampling strategy.
Results
The descriptive characteristics are shown in Table 1. Fourteen
percent of the men and 22% of the women included in the
survey reported having arthritis. Of the older men and
women who underwent the radiograph exam, approxi-
mately 43 and 50%, respectively, were diagnosed as having
knee osteoarthritis.
The results of the logistic regression analyses in which BMI
alone, WC alone or both BMI and WC were used as
continuous variables to predict arthritis and knee osteo-
arthritis are shown in Table 2. The OR were computed for
each sex-specific 1-SD change in the BMI and WC values. For
example, for each 1-SD increase in BMI in women, the odds
of knee osteoarthritis increased by 2.62-fold, whereas for
each 1-SD increase in WC, the odds of knee osteoarthritis
increased by 2.23-fold. Without exception, when BMI and
WC were examined individually, they were strong positive
predictors of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis, and the OR for
BMI and WC were comparable in magnitude. When both
BMI and WC were included in the same regression mode,
WC alone was an independent predictor of arthritis, whereas
BMI alone was an independent predictor of knee osteo-
arthritis.
Results of the logistic regression showing the OR for
arthritis and knee osteoarthritis, according to BMI tertiles,
are shown in Table 3. The corresponding OR for the WC
tertiles are shown in Table 4. Independent of sex, the
likelihood of arthritis and knee osteoarthritis increased in a
graded fashion when moving from the lowest to highest BMI
tertile. Similarly, the likelihood of arthritis and knee
osteoarthritis increased in a graded fashion when moving
from the lowest to highest WC tertile within both men and
women. For example, in men, the highest BMI tertile was
3.13 times more likely to have knee osteoarthritis compared
to the lowest BMI tertile, whereas the highest WC tertile was
2.91 times more likely to have knee osteoarthritis compared
to the lowest WC tertile.
In the next phase of analysis, subjects were divided into
WC tertiles within each of the BMI tertiles (Table 5). Owing to
smaller number of subjects within these BMI Â WC groups,
sex-specific analysis could not be performed. Within the
lowest BMI tertile, the odds of arthritis and knee osteo-
arthritis were not different in the lowest, middle and highest
WC tertiles. Within the middle BMI tertile, the middle and
high WC tertiles were more likely to have arthritis and knee
osteoarthritis compared to the lowest WC tertile (P ¼ 0.06 for
arthritis in high WC tertile). Within the highest BMI tertile,

Discussion
The primary purpose of this study was to determine if BMI
and WC have independent effects on arthritis, and more
specifically osteoarthritis of a weight-bearing joint such as
the knee. When both BMI and WC were used as continuous
variables to predict arthritis and knee osteoarthritis, BMI and
WC did not have independent effects on either arthritis or
knee osteoarthritis (Table 2). That is, when both of these
anthropometric variables were included in the same regres-
sion model, either one or the other predicted arthritis, and
once one of the variables entered into the regression model
the other fell out of the model and no longer predicted
arthritis or knee osteoarthritis. This finding is consistent
with that of previous studies, which found that WC did not
add to the predictive ability of continuous BMI measures
when predicting osteoarthritis risk.9,10
In the clinical setting, BMI and WC are categorized using a
threshold approach. The correlation between continuous
BMI and WC values is quite high; however, when BMI and
WC are categorized, the strength of the relation between
them is reduced.17 Therefore, BMI and WC are more likely
to have independent effects on arthritis when a clinical
approach is used because of the reduced covariance. Indeed,
when a classification system (tertiles) was used in this study,
BMI and WC were independent predictors of arthritis and
knee osteoarthritis. That is, within the middle- and high-BMI
categories, individuals in the higher WC category were more
likely to have arthritis and/or knee osteoarthritis than
individuals in the lowest WC category. Similarly, BMI had
effects beyond that of WC alone. Thus, within the middle
and highest WC categories, individuals in the highest BMI
category were more likely to have arthritis and/or knee
osteoarthritis than individuals in the lowest BMI category. It
is noteworthy that these associations were significant after
adjusting for the potential confounding effect of age, race
and sex. These observations indicate that BMI and WC have
independent effects on arthritis when they are categorized,
as in the clinical setting, and thus it is important for
clinicians and health-care practitioners to obtain measures of
both BMI and WC.
The finding that adults with high WC values are at
increased arthritis and osteoarthritis risk, independent of
BMI category, is entirely consistent with a large body of
evidence that has examined the combined influence of BMI
and WC on metabolic health risk and disease. Previously,
within the NHANES III cohort, it was demonstrated that
within normal weight, overweight and obese BMI categories,
those with high WC values are more likely to have
hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and the metabolic
syndrome, compared to those with normal WC values.18
Similar findings have been reported in a large and represen-
tative sample of Canadians.19 In addition to metabolic
disorders, Wonnamethee et al.20 recently reported that the
negative relationship between WC and measures of lung
function remained significant after adjustment for BMI in a
sample of 2744 older men. Houston et al.21 have also
reported that the influence of WC on functional limitation
and disability risk in older adults remains significant after
adjustment for BMI. When combined, these results support
the recommendation that measures of WC be added to
measures of BMI in the clinical evaluation of overweight and
obesity.6
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that causes ex-
cessive breakdown, loss of articular cartilage and destruction
of the periarticular bone. The etiology of osteoarthritis
involves local biomechanical factors, systemic biochemical
factors, as well as susceptibility that is related to age and
genetics.1,22 Excessive weight places a higher than normal
biomechanical load on the hip and knee joint during
activity, which is a likely mechanism by which total and
abdominal obesity is related to osteoarthritis.1 Obesity may
also be related to osteoarthritis via the increased release of
hormones, growth factors and cytokines from adipose tissue
that may play a subtle role in osteoarthritis.2 The weak
association between obesity and osteoarthritis of non-
weight-bearing joints in the hands and fingers is evidence
of this pathway.11 It has been shown that BMI and WC are
related to total fat mass in a similar order of magnitude, and
that for a given BMI category, total fat mass is higher in those
with a high WC than in those with a low WC.23 This finding
is consistent with the observation of the present study that

BMI and WC were related to osteoarthritis in a similar order
of magnitude, and that osteoarthritis risk was higher in those
with a high WC than in those with a low WC for a given BMI
tertile. Taken together, these results suggest that overall
adiposity, rather than a specific fat depot, is the mechanistic
link between BMI, WC and osteoarthritis.
This study has notable strengths, specifically the large and
representative sample that was examined and the considera-
tion of both arthritis (questionnaire) and knee osteoarthritis
(radiograph) as study outcomes. However, because this was a
cross-sectional study, we cannot infer causality about the
temporal nature of the relation between BMI, WC and
arthritis. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the
findings reported here. Further, there is likely a long lag
period between the onset of a high BMI and/or WC and the
onset of arthritis. For example, one study reported that BMI
measurements at age 20­29 years were strongly associated
with knee osteoarthritis 36 years later.24 This suggests the
strength of relationships between BMI, WC and arthritis may
have been underestimated in the present cross-sectional
study.
In conclusion, both BMI and WC were strong predictors of
arthritis and knee osteoarthritis in this large representative
sample of American adults. When both BMI and WC were
used as continuous variables to predict arthritis and knee
osteoarthritis, they did not have independent effects on
either arthritis or knee osteoarthritis. However, when a
categorical approach was used for BMI and WC, similar to that
in the clinical setting, independent effects of these anthro-
pometric exposure variables were observed on the arthritis
outcomes. In the light of these findings and previous
findings based on other obesity-related outcomes, we
recommend that health-care practitioners measure WC in
conjunction with BMI.
