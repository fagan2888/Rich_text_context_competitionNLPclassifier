Emotion in Action: An Integrative View
Imagine having an itch that triggers the irresistible impulse to
scratch. Although the motive (to do away with the itch) is not
necessarily a consciously set goal, the action (scratching) is pur-
posive: it implements the aim of the motive that called it forth,
namely getting rid of the itch. One may or may not become
aware of the itch, or of the motive to get rid of it, or of the act of
scratching. The action may be preceded by a consciousness of
the purpose to be attained, or may ensue without any premedita-
tion. Hence, our view on emotion in action necessitates neither
a distinct mandate of the will, nor the presupposition of aware-
ness of the motive for action. An action may be emotional even
if we are unable to render (or even understand) the words to
describe the motive.
An emotional act, in contrast to a predetermined act, is deter-
mined by its ultimate or proximate end. The motive of the action
is its desired end state (Grafton & Hamilton, 2007; Sebanz,
Bekkering, & Knoblich, 2006). Emotional actions serve the pur-
pose of rendering one's relation to the state of the world more
pleasant or less unpleasant. Emotional actions are produced by
motives to alter the current state of the world so as to approxi-
mate a more optimal state. These motives give rise to states of
action readiness. As elaborated in Frijda's work, changes in
action readiness form the key to what we call "emotions," since
action readiness covers the variations in self­object relation-
ships (e.g., Frijda, 1986, 2007). These states of action readiness
are propelled by how a perceived (or recalled or imagined)
object or event is appraised by the individual. Appraisal of
events in the world imparts purpose by giving rise to a state of
action readiness to change one's relation to its object. Emotional
action deals with the present situation by correlating it with rel-
evant concerns, and valuating the courses of action that will be
most likely to lead to its desired end. Predetermined actions are,
one might argue, ultimately also geared towards desirable states

Abstract
Starting from a decidedly Frijdian perspective on emotion in action, we adopt neurocognitive theories of action control to analyze
the mechanisms through which emotional action arises. Appraisal of events vis-à-vis concerns gives rise to a determinate motive
to establish a specific state of the world; the pragmatic idea of the action's effects incurs the valuation of action options and a
change in action readiness in the form of incipient ideomotor capture of the selected action. Forward modeling of the sensory
consequences of the selected action option allows for the evaluation and fine-tuning of anticipated action effects, which renders
the emotional action impulsive yet purposive. This novel theoretical synthesis depicts the cornerstone principles for a mechanistic
view on emotion in action.

or away from undesirable states. The difference is that such
actions result from innate, hard-wired, or overlearned stimulus­
response associations, without the intervening appraisal, motive,
and readiness for action that characterizes emotional acts.
Beyond being purposive, emotional actions comprise an
impetus for action--an inclination to do something--with a cer-
tain strength or urgency. These dynamic and energetic aspects
of emotional action have been caught under the designation of
control precedence of ongoing actions and strivings (Frijda,
1986, 2007). Control precedence includes persistence of action
over time until a particular end state has been reached, and
resumption of actions in spite of interruptions and obstacles.
Importantly, emotional action entails some anticipatory
image of the effects of the action (Eder & Hommel, 2013; Eder
& Rothermund, 2013; Frijda, Ridderinkhof, & Rietveld, 2014).
In order to predict action effects, interactive behavior is guided
by pragmatic processes that embed sensorimotor coordination in
prior knowledge and experiences (Gibson, 1979). Experience
endows stimuli with a power of awakening previously appropri-
ate reactions. Purposive action entails prediction or anticipation
of intended outcome (Clark, 2013; Engel, 2010). Such pragmatic
prediction rests on the neural mechanisms of forward modeling
of action effects. Forward models deliver predictions that help
interpret the sensory effects of one's actions, or those of others
(Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith, 2002; Desmurget & Grafton,
2000; O'Regan & Noë, 2001; Wolpert & Flanagan, 2001).
Present Aims
In what follows, we will study the mechanisms through which
emotional action arises. We will see how principles of predic-
tive processing map on the notions of incipient ideomotor cap-
ture and readiness for action, how motives are selected through
appraisal, how action options are selected through valuation,
and how the discrepancy between actual and desired action
effects is mitigated through forward modeling. The notions of
pragmatic idea and incipient ideomotor capture will be found to
constitute cornerstones for emotion in action. These proposals
are consistent with, on the one hand, Frijda's recent views on
emotion vis-à-vis impulsive action (Frijda et al., 2014), and, on
the other hand, the principles and mechanisms of perception­
action coordination laid out in a recent integrative theoretical
framework (impetus, motivation, and prediction in perception­
action coordination theory, or IMPPACT; Ridderinkhof, 2014).
The core mechanism for emotional action, as derived from these
positions, is summarized in Figure 1, and will be detailed in
what follows.
While the IMPPACT framework may be relatively new,
many of the ideas in the model and the views on the mecha-
nisms through which emotional action arises borrow heavily
from views that have been voiced in the (often very old) litera-
ture. While some of these views have been central to theoretical
views on emotion, others are newly introduced into this context.
A particularly novel contribution of this article will be to evalu-
ate the implications of introducing the forward model compo-
nent, central to IMPPACT, for understanding emotional action.
Thus, this article aims at a synthesis that integrates previous
work and extends it with the notion of forward modeling. For
somewhat similar theoretical work and empirical support, we
refer the reader to recent work by Eder and colleagues (Eder &
Hommel, 2013; Eder & Rothermund, 2013; Eder, Rothermund,
De Houwer, & Hommel, 2015).
Ingredients of Emotion in Action
Appraisal
Emotions are aroused by events: events as directly perceived, or
as recollected, or even as imagined. Motives for emotional
action are elicited by events as appraised. Appraisal refers to
the information that confers personal meaning to brute per-
ceived events, which is drawn from environmental stimuli plus
their temporal and spatial context (Frijda, 2007; Scherer, 2005).2
Appraisal results from interactions between event properties on
the one hand and the individual's sensitivities to these properties
on the other. Appraisal identifies what relationship should be
established or modified, and thus gives rise to a determinate
motive for action: whether or not something needs to be done
about it, and how urgently. Appraisal processes proceed largely
automatically, associatively, nonconsciously, and in a fraction
of a second (Frijda, 2013; Lambie & Marcel, 2002).
To illustrate: Incoming input (say, very loud heavy metal
music) activates not only the features that represent the stimulus
itself, but also (through rapidly spreading activation) all kinds
of features that have, mostly through previous experience,
become associated to the stimulus (such as concerns: a dislike
for loud sound, and a dislike for heavy metal, hypothetically
speaking). If a stimulus represents an "actual state of the world"
(say, being exposed to loud heavy metal) then a course com-
parison to associated concerns (dislike for loud music, dislike
for heavy metal) would, through simple and rapid computa-
tions, lead to the activation of the features of a "desired state of
the world" (no loud music, no heavy metal).
The central appraisal is whether an event is assessed as pro-
moting or obstructing one's concerns (Ellsworth & Scherer,
2003; Frijda, 2007; Scherer, 2005). Concerns relate to norms,
preferences, interests; to whatever affects the presence, availa-
bility, or intactness of everything the individual cares about (cf.
Frankfurt, 1988). Concerns can pertain to what the individual
may derive from the event (e.g., likely satisfaction or dissatis-
faction), or to opportunities for action (the action affordances
provided by the environment, given our expertise; Gibson,
1979). Crucially, in the absence of concern pertinence, there is
no motive, and no readiness to act; in short, no emotion (Frijda
et al., 2014).
Pragmatic Idea
The possibility of emotional acts, in which the response is deter-
mined by the effect it will exert, arises with the power of antici-
pation, so that actions are directed by the relation between act
and consequence (Ridderinkhof, 2014). The emotional act is
Ridderinkhof Emotion in Action 321
determined by reference to a desired end; hence, we must be
able to form some pragmatic idea which is capable of prompting
purposive action (consciously or not).
The pivot upon which emotional action turns is the forma-
tion of a pragmatic idea of the desired action effect. A pragmatic
idea consists of images of kinesthetic sensation associated with
the action and its anticipated effects on the world and on our
own body (Hobhouse, 1915). An environmental object or event
may be perceived as presenting a specific action affordance,
soliciting activation of the corresponding motor program, with-
out an agent's deliberate intention to act (Grèzes & Decety,
2002). The perceived affordance thus instigates an intention-in-
action (Searle, 1983) or motor intention (Dreyfus, 2005;
Pacherie, 2006). Indeed, pragmatic ideas of movement may
activate the descending motor pathways at subthreshold level
(e.g., Tanaka, Balleine, & O'Doherty, 2008), and are in fact rou-
tinely followed by discharges of their target muscles (Jacobsen,
1927). Harleß (1861/2012) used the term "Effektbild" to denote
the consequences of actions, not only in terms of sensory effects
but also in terms of outcomes that one can learn to pursue or
avoid. The results experienced after yielding to an impulse will
associate the impulse, in memory, with a foresight of those
results. "An impulse acted out may be said to be acted out, in
part at least, for the sake of its results" (James, 1890, p. 390).
Incipient Ideomotor Capture
William James famously wrote "We think the act, and it is done"
(1890, p. 522). Unzer (1771/1851) and Herbart (1816/1887)
were among the first to enunciate the notion that actions are
initiated by the anticipation of the desired sensory effects of the
projected action (for an historical analysis see Ridderinkhof,
2014). Herbart proposed that when an action is executed, asso-
ciations are formed between the action and its sensory effects;
these associations can be used subsequently to initiate those
actions that produce the desired action effects. Müller (1838)
observed that "The idea of a particular motion determines a cur-
rent of nervous action towards the necessary muscles, and gives
Figure 1. Schematic architecture for ideomotor action according to the IMPPACT model. Stimuli and ideas (denoted by letters A, B, etc.) activate the
corresponding motor controllers (denoted by numbers 1, 2, etc.) via a series of ideomotor processes. Appraisal of the stimuli and ideas yields motives
in the form of desired action effects (denoted by letters A'', B'', etc.). Action options (denoted by numbers 1'', 2'', etc.) are valued in terms of optimal
opportunity for bringing about the desired action ends. The elected course of action captures the motor system incipiently before being executed in
full. Action effects (as perceived through exteroceptive senses) are fed into a comparator (symbolized by the purple-colored hexagon) to be compared
against the desired action effects, giving rise (in case of discrepancy) to a prediction error (PE) which is used to revaluate and adjust the chose action
option. (Adapted from Ridderinkhof, 2014.)
322 Emotion Review Vol. 9 No. 4
rise to the motion independently of the will" (p. 944). Some
individuals, when walking closely to the rim of a precipice,
experience the compulsion to jump off, as phrased by Bacon
(1826): "[F]or, imagining a fall, it putteth his spirit into the very
action of a fall" (p. 957). This conception was articulated more
generally by Lotze (1852): "As soon as an idea of an accessible
goal surfaces into memory, the unfolding action appears as
directed to that goal, seeking to approach it" (p. 298). Carpenter
(1853) labeled the notion that thinking of the effects of an action
tends to set the action in motion as ideomotor (to distinguish it
from sensorimotor action).
The pragmatic idea of a desired action effect can serve to
retrieve the action that gives rise to the sensory effects associ-
ated with the appropriate action effect (Herwig, Prinz, &
Waszak, 2007). The ideomotor principle thus holds that any
activation of the pragmatic idea of an action's effect may
awaken the corresponding action. As James (1890) observed,
"The idea of the movement's sensory effects will have become
an immediate antecedent condition to the production of the
movement itself" (p. 586). However, such ideomotor action is
only incipient: "The drive does not attain its goal just by itself,
like some physical power; it hardly exceeds beyond an aspira-
tion, a striving for an aspired effect" (Lotze, 1852, pp. 296­
297). The nascent ideomotor tendency may be left quiescent
unless its motive power is sufficiently strong to solicit and cap-
ture the action in a maximum degree; the motive becomes motor
only when the nascent excitation becomes an unchecked
impulse (Lewes, 1877).
Changes in Action Readiness
Incipient ideomotor capture may thus remain limited to mere
potentiations of the neural dispositions underlying the actions
concerned, without motor engagement (Frijda et al., 2014; van
Loon, van den Wildenberg, van Stegeren, Hajcak, &
Ridderinkhof, 2010). Such states of action readiness are best
described as states of readiness to establish, maintain, or modify
some self­object relationship; in other words, to prepare for
effecting some action that reduces the discrepancy between our
current state and the desired state (Deonna & Teroni, 2012).
Changes in action readiness are central to emotions (Frijda,
2007; McDougall, 1928).
The term action readiness is borrowed from Dewey's theory
of emotions (1895): "When we say that John Smith is very
resentful at the treatment he has received . . . we mean he is in a
certain practical attitude, has assumed a readiness to act in cer-
tain ways" (p. 17). Bull (1945) luminously extended the James­
Lange theory of the emotions (in which we do not cry because
we feel sorry, but feel sorry because we cry) by claiming that the
sorry feeling results from readiness to cry, rather than from
actually crying.
We feel angry as a result of readiness to strike, and feel afraid as a result
of readiness to run away, and not because of actually hitting out or
running . . . In other words, feeling, or affect, arises from preparatory
attitudes, maintained as readiness or a wish, and held in leash pending
the lifting of whatever form of interfering mechanism is holding up the
action. (p. 211)
A state of action readiness may be felt by the agent as a non-
overt inclination, or experienced as a mental image of action
(Ridderinkhof & Brass, 2015).
Valuation of Action Options
Given a specific motive for action, a person can avail herself of
a number of different alternative courses of action to accom-
plish a modification in a particular self­world relationship,
such as the riddance of an itch (Frijda, 1986). To offer a typical
Frijdian example: When charmed by someone, one may utter
endeared words, offer a rose, or try and steal a kiss in an attempt
to draw or keep the charming person nearby; when running
away in fear, one seeks to increase the distance to the danger
source, but one may also hide behind a protective barrier, or
throw an obstacle in front of the approaching threat (Frijda,
2007). Action options are then evaluated in terms of their apt-
ness for bringing about these desired action effects. The vari-
ous action alternatives differ in their value with respect to both
their cost (in terms of energy expenditure or financial endow-
ment) and their benefit (in bringing the actual state closer to the
desired state).
Adequacy and efficacy of action alternatives scale with the
availability of relevant skills or expertise (Rietveld, 2012). To
the skilled badminton opponent, appraisal of even a well-con-
cealed crossed drop-shot may generate a relevant affordance for
adequate nonreflective reaction which--without premeditation
or further deliberation--renders a specific motive state, a readi-
ness to act, an adequate action impulse. By contrast, a lack of
relevant affordances may leave the novice stand "frozen"--that
is, without an intent, without a concrete motive for action, with-
out any action impulse (Frijda et al., 2014).
The ideomotor principle does not in itself entail a mecha-
nism through which the motivational value of the outcome
influences the selection of the best-suited action. Benefits need
to be weighed against expenditure in a cost­benefit analysis (for
review see Schouppe, Demanet, Boehler, Ridderinkhof, &
Notebaert, 2014). Computational approaches accomplish this
integration by modifying weights of alternative choices in pro-
portion to reward prediction errors--that is, discrepancies
between expected and actual outcomes. At the neurobiological
level, such prediction errors are encoded by midbrain dopamine
signals (for review see Frank, Cohen, & Sanfey, 2009).
Valuation of action options is driven further by a comparison
between desired and anticipated action effects. If this compari-
son results in discrepancy, then the ensuing prediction error
(PE) will serve to update the incentive value of the action option,
resulting in value learning as an integrated part of repeated
action emulation (for review see Ridderinkhof, 2014).
Forward Modeling of Action Effects
When there is the idea of a desired end, the motive provides the
impetus to act. We direct effort to what we desire. Desire impreg-
nates the emotional action with the sense of tension, and of effort
to relief the tension by reducing the discrepancy between the
current state and the desired end (Lewin, 1926). When there is
Ridderinkhof Emotion in Action 323
foresight of the ultimate end, the tension is relieved through pur-
posive effort. The pragmatic idea of the required effort and of the
muscular exertion requisite to perform a certain movement is
derived from the anticipatory image of the action's effects. But
where does the anticipation, the foresight of the action effect
come from?
Emotional action entails a further critical component: pre-
dictive processing through forward modeling. The brain con-
tinually generates and tests predictions to reduce uncertainty
about the effects of our actions (Friston, 2012; Kempf, 1921).
Within this conjecture, predictive processing provides a neuro-
biological and computational framework for understanding
emotional action, with forward modeling as a rapid means for
verifying whether the projected action meets the desired end
(see Figure 2). Forward models predict the sensory effects of the
selected action program. The comparison of this prediction to
the desired state yields a PE that can be used to optimize the
selection of those actions that are adequate for effecting the
desired state (Frith, Blakemore, & Wolpert, 2000), allowing for
emotional action: that motor program is selected that is most
likely to attain the desired action effect (Ridderinkhof, 2014).
Without a forward model the organism can only act and learn on
the basis of actual behavior; the forward model provides an
opportunity for the rapid simulation of action, which provides a
platform for action decision and learning without the risks and
perils of the effects and consequences of overt action in the real
world.
Forward modeling and its computational bases have been
developed extensively in the literature on motor control (e.g.,
Wolpert & Flanagan, 2001) and have recently been elaborated
in the literature on predictive processing (e.g., Friston, 2012).
They are introduced here in the emotion literature, providing a
solid footing for the selection of actions to meet emotional
motives, and hence indeed rendering such actions emotional in
Figure 2. Schematic architecture for ideomotor action, supplemented with a forward model (turning action selection into an action­effect prediction-
and-valuation cycle), according to the IMPPACT model. The forward model calculates the predicted action effects (denoted by letters A''', B''', etc.,
for exteroceptive action effects, and numbers 1''', 2''', etc., for interoceptive and proprioceptive action effects), which are fed into a comparator
(symbolized by the purple-colored hexagon). Predicted action effects are compared to actual action effects, giving rise (in case of discrepancy) to a
prediction error (PE) which is fed back into the forward model so as to optimize its predictions. Predicted action effects are compared to desired action
effects, in which case a PE is used to revaluate and adjust the chose action option, which is then fed into the forward model in its turn; the cycle
continues until PE is minimized and the appropriate action can be executed. (Adapted from Ridderinkhof, 2014.)
324 Emotion Review Vol. 9 No. 4
a meaningful way. The notion that emotion in action entails for-
ward modeling of action effects in order to attain motives (as
specified in terms of desired action effects) implies that emo-
tional action may be considered as ideomotor action. Such a
framing may help generate novel hypotheses, that allow for
empirical tests (for a seminal example see Eder et al., 2015).
Multiple Emotions
The events we encounter often touch upon a multiplicity of con-
cerns and elicit multiple appraisals, and hence multiple states of
action readiness simultaneously. The emotional action impulse
incited by one motive may be antagonized and checked by com-
peting motives simultaneously present, given that the competi-
tors are of sufficient strength (Franck, 1878; Michotte & Prüm,
1910). The suggestion of a cool beer may awaken desire, while
simultaneously this suggestion may activate the memory of last
night's serious hangover and hence elicit aversion. Mixed emo-
tions can be observed in nostalgia, consisting of pain moderated
by the happiness that was, together with pleasure moderated by
the regret that it had gone (Bellelli & Saldarelli, 1990).
Multiple emotions require coordination in the form of emo-
tion regulation (Frijda et al., 2014). Some impulses are best held
in check until more appropriate times: when holding a cup of
hot coffee, an itch may well trigger a scratching impulse, but
one would do better to put the cup on a nearby table before giv-
ing in to the urge. As a final example borrowed from Nico
Frijda, one may consider it worth to suffer prolonged torture for
not betraying a comrade, and even to commit suicide to prevent
betraying.
Conclusions
In sum, emotional actions are instigated by events that, by pro-
cesses of appraisal that assess the event's relevance to the indi-
vidual's concerns, elicit some motive to establish or modify a
specific state of the world. The ensuing state of action readiness
drives and instigates emotional action that helps attain that state,
or rather, helps reduce the discrepancy between the desired and
current state. The prediction of the sensory consequences of the
selected action option allows for the evaluation and fine-tuning
of anticipated action effects vis-à-vis what the action should
accomplish, which renders the emotional action impulsive yet
purposive. Through efference copies or forward modeling, the
pragmatic anticipation leads to a state of action readiness. As a
result, the action is by definition emotional.
This article introduces the mechanism of forward modeling
into the emotion literature, as part of a theoretical synthesis of
often old concepts, integrated in IMPPACT (Ridderinkhof,
2014). We do not claim substantial differences between the key
components introduced here, and how these component pro-
cesses or constructs (and their underlying mechanisms) are
dealt with in the relevant literatures. Rephrasing questions about
emotional behavior in terms of underlying constructs and mech-
anisms of information processing may not in itself add much
explanation. Our aim here was to evaluate whether, from an
action control perspective, a meaningful integration and synthe-
sis with emotion theory is feasible, at least at the level of the
conceptual components. It is our hope that the present theoreti-
cal synthesis, and in particular its inclusion of forward mode-
ling, may engender a deeper understanding of emotion in action
(or at least a framework from which novel and testable predic-
tions can be derived).

Notes
1 The theoretical synthesis presented here was heavily inspired by the
work of Nico Frijda. Our interactions over the past few years have
resulted in joint theoretical work on impulsive action (Frijda et al.,
2014), a topic where Frijda's views on emotions met Rietveld's philo-
sophical work on action affordance and the present author's work on
the cognitive neuroscience of action control. Only weeks before writ-
ing the present article, Nico Frijda passed away at the age of 87. The
field as a whole, and this recent pupil in particular, are deeply indebted
to his influential contributions; Nico will be dearly missed by all. The
present article, and any discussion it may stir, form a humble tribute to
Nico Frijda, an original thinker and great inspirator.
2 Emotions often manifest social significance, but do not necessar-
ily qualify as such. Frijda recounted the example of hitting his head
against a kitchen cupboard door, and then hitting and scolding at the
cupboard in anger, which relieved the annoyance and frustration of
impotence without serving any evident social purpose.
