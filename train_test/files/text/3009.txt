Background: Little is known about outcomes of com-
munity-based treatment programs for adolescents with
drug problems.
Methods: We studied 1167 adolescents (age range, 11-
18 years; 368 females, 799 males) from 4 US cities (Pitts-
burgh, Pa; Minneapolis, Minn; Chicago, Ill; and Port-
land, Ore) using a naturalistic, nonexperimental evalu-
ation design. These adolescents were consecutive
admissions during the period from 1993 to 1995 at 23
community-based treatment programs in the Drug Abuse
Treatment Outcome Studies for Adolescents. Included
were 418 admissions to 8 residential programs, 292 ad-
missions to 9 outpatient drug-free programs, and 457 ad-
missions to 6 short-term inpatient programs.
Results: Adolescents in treatment typically had mul-
tiple problems (eg, 58.4% of them were involved in the
legal system, and 63.0% met diagnostic criteria for a men-
tal disorder). Nevertheless, less than half (43.8%) of all
patients reported weekly marijuana use in the year fol-
lowing treatment (dropping from 80.4% in the year be-
fore admission). Similarly, there were decreases in heavy
drinking (dropping from 33.8% to 20.3%), use of other
illicit drugs (dropping from 48.0% to 42.2%), and crimi-
nal involvement (dropping from 75.6% to 52.8%). Ad-
ditionally, patients reported better psychological adjust-
mentandschoolperformanceaftertreatment.Longer stays
in treatment were positively associated with several fa-
vorable outcomes, although length of time in treatment
was generally short.
Conclusions: Substance abuse treatment for adoles-
cents is effective in achieving many important behav-
ioral and psychological improvements. Strategies spe-
cific to adolescents to improve their treatment retention
and completion are needed to maximize the therapeutic
benefits of drug treatment.

IN RECENT YEARS, increased con-
cern about alcohol and drug use
among youths has resulted in an
increase in the number of alco-
hol and drug treatment pro-
grams for adolescents.1,2 Still, relatively
little research has focused on the effec-
tiveness of treatment for adolescent alco-
hol and drug abuse, and most literature on
treatment outcomehasbeenbasedonadult
patients.2,3 Most earlier large-scale evalu-
ation studies have focused primarily on
adults and have included only small
samples of adolescents. The few treat-
ment outcome studies on adolescents of-
fer mixed results.2 The large-scale evalu-
ation studies have generally reported less
favorable outcomes among adolescents
than adult patients.4-6 For example, ado-
lescents interviewed 1 year after treat-
ment in the Treatment Outcome Prospec-
tive Study (TOPS) showed favorable
reductions in drug use and criminal ac-
tivities. However, almost 25% to 30% of
youths still reported daily use of mari-
juana and heavy use of alcohol following
TOPS treatment.5 The Services Research
Outcomes Study7 compared adolescents'
behaviors during the 5-year period be-
fore treatment and the 5 years after treat-
ment, and found that alcohol use in-
creased by 13%, and rates of crack use were
approximately doubled. Results from other
small-scale evaluation studies8-10 of ado-
lescent treatment have similarly sug-
gested that although there is a reduction
of use after treatment, a large proportion
of adolescents return to drug and alcohol
use following treatment.1,11
Adolescents go through distinctive
developmental stages; therefore, their sub-
stance abuse patterns12-14 and the factors
influencing their use may differ from those
of adults. Thus, they may require differ-
ent types of treatment strategies. The re-
centDrugAbuseTreatmentOutcomeStud-
ies for Adolescents (DATOS-A) is the first
large-scale effort designed specifically to

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
DATOS-A is a multisite prospective treatment outcome
study.15 The study includes 1732 consecutive admissions
to 23 programs in 4 major US cities (Pittsburgh, Pa; Min-
neapolis, Minn; Chicago, Ill; and Portland, Ore) from 1993
to 1995. Although the study originally included patients
and programs in Miami, Fla, and New York, NY, they were
excluded from the present study because of the adminis-
trative and logistical problem of implementing follow-up
interviews. The cities selected for participation in DATOS-A
were limited to those in which DATOS adult data collec-
tion was being conducted. In these locations, programs re-
cruited for DATOS-A were providers specializing in ado-
lescent treatment that were judged to be stable community-
based organizations. No programs selected to participate
refused. Treatment modalities included residential (RES)
programs, outpatient drug-free (ODF) programs, and short-
term inpatient (STI) programs. These adolescents were as-
sessed at intake and targeted for 1-year posttreatment in-
terviews. The present analysis included 1167 adolescents
who completed the follow-up interviews (ie, a 67.3% in-
terview completion rate).
PARTICIPANTS
The focus of the present study was on 1167 adolescent pa-
tients (from 23 programs) who completed both the intake
assessment and the 1-year follow-up interviews. Included
were 418 patients in 8 RES programs, 292 patients in 9 ODF
programs, and 457 patients in 6 STI programs. The over-
all study sample was 31.5% female, 66.2% white, 18.3%
black, 9.3% Hispanic, and 6.3% other ethnic groups. The
mean±SD age was 15.7±1.3 years. More than 80% were
currently in or had completed the ninth grade. One third
(37.4%) were not attending school at the time of treatment
admission. Surprisingly, even at these young ages, 45.8%
reported employment for at least some period during the
12 months before admission to the DATOS-A treatment.
Almost half (47.1%) of these adolescents reported mari-
juanauseastheirprimarydrugproblem.Anadditional20.6%
cited alcohol use as their primary problem. Table 1 pre-
sents characteristics of the sample by modality.
The generally high attrition rate in the follow-up study
is not unusual for large-scale field studies of this type. Al-
though the field research team attributed the attrition mainly
to logistical and resource constraints, careful examination
of its effect was deemed necessary to rule out any system-
atic bias. We compared the subjects without follow-up in-
terviews with those who completed follow-up interviews
and did not find any differences in age, use of drugs (eg,
marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, or other illicit drugs), or en-
rollment in school. The 2 samples also did not differ in treat-
ment retention in STI or ODF programs, but patients in
RES programs who completed follow-up stayed in treat-
ment significantly longer than those without follow-up
(mean days in treatment, 124.4 vs 105.4, respectively). The
follow-up sample had a higher proportion of female (31.5%)
andwhite(66.2%)participantsandlowerproportionsofblack
(18.3%) and Hispanic (9.3%) participants compared with
those without follow-up (21.3% female, 60.3% white, 21.9%
black, and 12.5% Hispanic).
TREATMENT PROGRAMS
Questionnaires completed by the program directors and
counseling supervisors provided the description of treat-
ment protocols, policies, and staff at participating DATOS-A
facilities.
Residential treatment programs included traditional,
modified, and short-term therapeutic community pro-
grams, as well as other types of RES programs. The pro-
grams provided residential living, education and coun-
seling sessions, and interventions designed to resocialize
patients. One half of the RES programs provided group
sessions almost daily, and 87.5% provided individual
counseling sessions at least once per week. One half of
the RES programs placed great emphasis on family
therapy. Planned or recommended duration of stay
ranged from 3 to 12 months (median, 5 months).
Outpatient drug-free programs included regular and in-
tensive day treatment. Services included counseling ses-
sions, education, and skills training. About 78% of the pro-
grams provided group sessions 3 or more times per week,
55.6% of the programs had individual sessions once per
week, and an additional 22.2% of programs had indi-
vidual sessions 2 to 3 times per week. All but one ODF pro-
gram reported great emphasis on family therapy. Planned
duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 6 months (me-
dian, 1.6 months).
Short-term inpatient programs provided services (eg,
counseling sessions and "12-step" sessions) within a medi-
cally controlled environment. A majority of the programs
had daily group sessions and weekly individual sessions.
All reported a strong emphasis on family therapy. Planned
duration of stay ranged from 5 to 35 days (median, 18 days).
Patients were typically referred for continued outpatient
treatment at discharge.
All programs were primarily drug treatment pro-
grams, as opposed to alcohol-only treatment programs, and
most had a mixture of funding from both public and pri-
vate sources. The number of years these programs had been
in operation ranged from 1 to 25 years, with the mean be-
ing 14 years.
PATIENT INTAKE ASSESSMENT AND
FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES
Informed consent to participate in the study was
obtained from a parent or guardian of anyone younger
than 18 years, as well as from the adolescent. Face-to-
face interviews were conducted in private settings by
trained professional interviewers who were independent
of the treatment programs. The interviews were con-
ducted at intake and at a 12-month posttreatment
follow-up. Intake interviews were conducted at program
sites in 2 separate sessions approximately 1 week apart.
Interviewers recontacted patients for face-to-face
follow-up interviews approximately 12 months after
their last contact with the treatment program. Each
interview session lasted approximately 90 minutes.
Patients were paid $10 for each intake interview and $15
for the follow-up interview.
For validation of self-reported drug use, a quarter
of the respondents were selected randomly for urinalysis.
Specimens were obtained from 249 (85%) of the selected

refused to or were unable to provide an adequate speci-
men for testing.
MEASURES
Problem Severity Index
An index of problem severity at intake was defined using
variables representing functional domains commonly re-
lated to treatment goals and outcomes. Eight indicators were
scored to reflect "problems" in these domains. The pa-
tient problem severity index is the sum of the presence of
these 8 problems (range, 0-8); the index was further clas-
sified into low (0-2), medium (3-5), and high (6-8) levels
of severity. The indicators were multiple drug use (use of
3 drugs during the year before treatment), dependence
on alcohol or any drug (by DSM-III-R criteria16), mental dis-
order (conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, or major depres-
sive disorder, using DSM-III-R criteria), criminal
involvement, unstable living arrangement, family alcohol
and other drug (AOD) problems, deviant reference group,
and academic failure prior to DATOS-A treatment. Pa-
tients were considered criminally active if they were on pro-
bation or parole, awaiting trial or had a case pending at in-
take, or reported a period of weekly involvement in illegal
activities during the past year. The unstable living arrange-
ment scale ranged from 0 to 9 (with a greater value indi-
cating greater instability) and was the summed presence
of the following conditions: receiving supplemental secu-
rity income (0=no; 1=yes), not having adequate food or
shelter(0=no;1=yes),livinginanunstableresidence(range,
1-3; 1=house or condominium; 2=mobile home, apart-
ment, or other multiple family building; 3=hotel, board-
ing house, homeless shelter), number of places lived (range,
1-3), and not living with parents (0=no, 1=yes). The scale
for family AOD problems had a range of 0 to 5, with 5 be-
ing the most problematic, and is the summed presence of
AOD problems among the adolescent's mother, father, moth-
er's relatives, father's relatives, and sisters or brothers. Scores
on the deviant reference group ranged between 0 and 12
(with a greater value indicating greater severity) by count-
ing the number of family members and friends who used
drugs, drank alcohol heavily, had been arrested, or were
jailed. An academic failure scale (range, 0-9, with a greater
value indicating greater failure) considered repeating grades
(range, 0-2; 0=no, 1=once, 2=more than once); being sus-
pended (range 0-2; 0=no, 1=once, 2=more than once) or
expelled (range, 0-2; 0=no, 1=once, 2=more than once);
skipping school (0=no, 1=yes); and whether first expul-
sion, suspension (0=younger than 15 years, 1=15 years or
older), or truancy occurred prior to age 15 years (0=younger
than 15 years, 1=15 years or older). Most problem indi-
cators were dichotomous variables, and a median split was
used for those with continuous scales (ie, unstable living
arrangement, family AOD problems, deviant reference
group, and academic failure).
Treatment Retention
Treatment retention was defined as the number of days be-
tween DATOS-A program admission and discharge.
Patients in each modality were classified as having short-
term or long-term retention. For RES and ODF programs,
the retention threshold for the long-term groups was set
at 90 days, and for STI programs, the threshold was 21 days.
Especially for RES and ODF, these retention thresholds have
been demonstrated to be predictive of positive outcomes
for adults in treatment.17,18 Overall, 58.4% of the RES sample
stayed in treatment for at least 90 days as did 27.1% of the
ODF sample, and 63.7% of the patients in STI programs
exceeded the 21-day criterion.
Outcome Measures
Outcome measures included drug-use patterns, psycho-
logical adjustment, criminal involvement, and school per-
formance. For each type of drug, respondents were asked
about their average use during a specific time frame (eg,
12 months before treatment admission or before the fol-
low-up interview), and there were 8 response categories
(ranging from "not used at all" and "less than once a month,"
to "daily or almost every day" and "4 or more times a day").
Measures of drug use included any use of marijuana; weekly
(once per week or more frequently) use of marijuana; heavy
drinking (5 drinks in a single sitting at least once per
week); any use of hallucinogens, cocaine, or other stimu-
lants; and use of any illicit drug excluding marijuana. Mea-
sures of psychological adjustment included any suicidal
thoughts, hostility (a subscale of a 90-item Symptoms
Checklist; Cronbach =.88),19 and self-esteem (Cron-
bach =.89).20 Measures of school performance included
school attendance (currently in school) and grades (among
those in school). Measures of criminal activities included
engagement in illegal acts and arrest. All variables were re-
peated measures for the year prior to and the year follow-
ing treatment, permitting pretreatment and posttreatment
comparisons.
Urine specimens collected from the randomly se-
lected subsample of 249 respondents during the fol-
low-up interviews were tested for 8 categories of drugs (am-
phetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids,
cocaine metabolite, methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine).
Positive rates were 35.7% for marijuana, 2.8% for cocaine,
and less than 1% for the remaining drugs. Comparing self-
reports with urine results, underreporting of marijuana use
was about 13% among those who denied use in the previ-
ous 30 days.
ANALYSES
We provided descriptive statistics to characterize patient
pretreatment characteristics. A series of statistical tests
(analysis of variance [ANOVA] for continuous depen-
dent variables and 2 tests for categorical variables) was
conducted to test the effect of modality. Repeated-
measures ANOVAs were conducted to examine the pre-
treatment and posttreatment differences in key out-
comes (controlling for modality). Logistic regression
analyses were conducted to determine the effects of
treatment length (short-term vs long-term) on posttreat-
ment outcomes, controlling for pretreatment severity
(low, medium, and high) and modality (RES, ODF, and
STI programs). All significance tests were 2-tailed, and
unless otherwise indicated, P=.05.

evaluate treatment outcomes among adolescents. Treat-
ment programs included in DATOS-A were community
programs specifically intended to treat adolescents with
drug problems. This article reports results of an assess-
ment of treatment outcomes among adolescent patients
participating in DATOS-A. The study addressed 3 key
research questions: (1) What were the patterns of drug
use and other problem behaviors of these adolescents
before they entered the DATOS-A treatment programs?
(2) Were there changes in their drug use and other
problem behaviors after treatment? (3) Was the length
of stay in treatment related to their posttreatment out-
comes?
RESULTS
PRETREATMENT CHARACTERISTICS
The average patient in DATOS-A was aged 15 to 16 years,
male (68.5%), white (66.2%) or black (18.3%), referred
by family or friends (41.6%) or the legal system (38.6%),
and was in trouble with the law (ie, 58.4% were on pa-
role, probation, or awaiting trial) (Table 1). The percent-
age of white participants was highest in STI programs
(78.8%), compared with 67.8% in ODF and 51.4% in RES
programs. Sources of referral also reflected significant dif-
ferences by modality, with referral by family or friends
to ODF programs being the highest (54.8%), compared
with 49.2% to STI programs and 23.9% to RES pro-
grams. Referral by the legal system to RES programs was
highest (63.6%), compared with 26.0% to STI and 22.6%
to ODF programs.
Many of the patients were polydrug users (25.4%
used 3 drugs), dependent on alcohol or other drugs ac-
cording to DSM-III-R criteria (73.0% of participants; with
64.1%, 36.1%, and 10.0% dependent on marijuana, al-
cohol, and cocaine, respectively), diagnosed as having a
mental disorder (63.0% of participants; 57.3% had a con-
duct disorder, 12.3% had attention-deficit/hyper-
activity disorder, 15.0% had a depressive disorder, 1.9%
had overanxious disorder, and 1.9% had panic disor-
der), and most patients were criminally active (67.2%).
More than one quarter (27.9%) of participants had a his-
tory of prior drug treatment, with the highest rates be-
ing among patients in RES (38.7%) and STI (27.9%) pro-
grams, and the lowest among patients in ODF programs
(12.7%).
POSTTREATMENT OUTCOMES
Overall, there were significant improvements in drug use,
psychological adjustment, school performance, and crimi-
nal activity during the year after treatment, compared with
the year before treatment (Table 2). Weekly or more

*Values are given as percentages unless otherwise indicated. Presence of dependence (alcohol or other drug [AOD]) or mental disorder was determined by
DSM-III-R criteria. Legal involvement referred to any involvement with the legal system (eg, in jail or detention, probation, parole, case pending). Unstable living
arrangement scale (range, 0-9, with 9 being most unstable) considered the presence of the following conditions: receiving Supplemental Security Income, without
adequate food/shelter, in unstable residence, number of places lived, and not living with parents. Family AOD problems score (range, 0-5, with 5 being most
problematic) was the summed presence of AOD problems among mother, father, mother's relatives, father's relatives, and sisters or brothers. Deviant reference
group score (range, 0-12, with 12 being most deviant) counted the number of family members and friends who used drugs, drank alcohol heavily, had been
arrested, or entered jail. Academic failure (range, 0-9, with 9 indicating a greater failure) considered repeating grades, being suspended or expelled, skipping
school, and whether first expulsion, suspension, or truancy occurred prior to age 15 years. Readers are referred to the text for more details on each scale
construction. RES indicates residential; STI, short-term inpatient; ODF, outpatient drug-free; and ANOVA, analysis of variance. 2 Or ANOVA analyses were
conducted to test modality differences.

frequent marijuana use dropped from 80.4% in the year
before admission to 43.8% in the year following treat-
ment. Similarly, heavy drinking dropped from 33.8% to
20.3%, use of other illicit drugs dropped from 48.0% to
42.2%, and criminal activities dropped from 75.6% to
52.8%. Additionally, patients reported better psycho-
logical adjustment in terms of reduced suicidal thoughts
and hostility, and increased self-esteem. During the year
after treatment, more patients attended school and re-
ported average or better than average grades compared
with the year before treatment. There were exceptions
to this general pattern of improvement, however. In the
total sample, cocaine use increased to 19.2% at fol-
low-up from 16.5% before intake (Qw1
=3.76; P=.05),
mainly due to increases among patients in STI (Qw1
=9.52;
P=.002) and ODF (Qw1
=6.95; P=.008) programs. Pa-
tients in ODF programs also showed no improvement in
their use of hallucinogens and stimulants, and they sig-
nificantly increased use of illicit drugs other than mari-
juana (Qw1
=4.94, P=.03). Additionally, although the level
of illegal acts was reduced from pretreatment levels for
adolescents treated in ODF programs (Qw1
=18.04,
P.001), there was a (nonsignificant) increase in arrest
rates for these patients.
To investigate how treatment retention might affect
treatmentoutcomesamongadolescents,weconductedsepa-
rate logistic regression analyses for selected post-
treatment outcomes, controlling for problem severity and
modality (Table 3). Even including STI programs, longer
time in treatment was found to be significantly related to
lower drug use (eg, any marijuana use, or any drug or al-
cohol use) and lower rates of arrest following treatment.
This important finding does not establish thresholds for
necessary minimum treatment durations, but it does rep-
licate a finding that has been repeatedly demonstrated in
adult evaluation research.17,18

*Values are given as percentages unless otherwise indicated. Drug use for each specific type was any use during the time period, except for weekly marijuana
(once a week or more frequent use) and heavy drinking (5 drinks in a single sitting at least once a week). Hostility was measured using a subscale of the
Symptoms Checklist (90 items). Self-esteem was measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Attendance indicated being currently in school. RES indicates
residential; ODF, outpatient drug-free; STI, short-term inpatient; and ANOVA, analysis of variance. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted to test
pretreatment and posttreatment differences, controlling for modality.

lowing discharge. Less than half (43.8%) returned to regu-
lar (at least weekly) marijuana use, and there were
significant reductions in criminality, heavy drinking, and
use of other illicit drugs. Additionally, these adolescent
patients showed significant improvement in psychologi-
cal adjustment and were doing better in school after treat-
ment. These improvements were observed across the 3
modalities of treatment programs.
It should be emphasized that the improvements
achieved following treatment are particularly impres-
sive in light of the following considerations. First, these
adolescents typically displayed multiple problems (eg,
polydrug use, mental disorders, criminal involvement,
unstable living arrangements, family drug-use prob-
lems, deviant reference groups, and academic failure).
Therefore, treating these adolescents represents a con-
siderable challenge. Second, reductions in alcohol and
drug use and other problem behaviors observed in the
present study were consistent and significant, with few
exceptions. The marked reductions in marijuana and al-
cohol use (the major drugs of abuse for this population)
and illegal activities are particularly encouraging in the
context of these adolescents' developmental stages. Many
surveys of the general population21,22 have reported that
there is an acceleration in alcohol and drug use during
adolescence. Thus, the reversal of this trend among treated
adolescents in the present study supports the effective-
ness of treatment for this group.
The present study also reveals several findings that are
consistentwiththoseintheadultliterature.Patientsinpro-
gramsofdifferentmodalitiesseemedtoreflectdifferentlev-
els of problem severity (eg, patients in RES programs were
the most troubled, with criminal justice activities and re-
ferrals, school difficulties, and peer deviance). Hence, the
various modalities are differentially employed by referral
sources and, therefore, are dealing with somewhat differ-
ent patient populations. Thus, adolescents may require dif-
fering strategies to achieve resolution of those problems.
Thepresentstudyalsoconfirmedthefindingsofpriorstud-
ies on adults,17-24 showing that patients who stayed in treat-
ment longer were more likely to have more favorable out-
comes, even when patient problem severity and modality
were statistically controlled.
The findings of the present study also suggest ways
to further improve treatment outcomes among adoles-
cents. Despite important improvements in drug use and
other measures, many adolescents were still engaging in
negative behaviors (eg, 20.3% drank heavily, 19.2% used
cocaine, 42.2% used illicit drugs other than marijuana, and
52.8% committed crimes) during the year after treatment.
Theseresultswerelargelyassociatedwiththegenerallyshort
lengths of stay among adolescents in DATOS-A treatment
programs (ie, almost three quarters of patients in ODF pro-
grams stayed less than 3 months). Thus, strategies spe-
cific to adolescents are needed to improve retention and
completion of drug treatment by adolescent patients in or-
der to maximize therapeutic benefits.25 Additionally, as we
have discussed earlier, many of these adolescents were
troubled by multiple problems. While this is comparable
to findings for adult drug users, the timely resolution of
theseproblemsmaybeevenmorecriticaltosuccessfultreat-
mentforadolescents,consideringtheirdevelopmentalpro-
cess. Failure to address adolescents' drug use and related
problems in the context of the additional need to com-
plete stage-appropriate developmental tasks can delay or
frustrate adolescents' capacity to assume behaviors criti-
cal to responsible adulthood. A large body of research has
demonstrated that drug use and other antisocial behav-
iors initiated in adolescence are frequently maintained
throughyoungadulthood.26-31 Howtoeffectivelyassistado-
lescent patients to address the multiple problems in their
lives, especially those involving their close family mem-
bers or friends, represents a continuing challenge to the
treatment field.
National multisite and multimodality naturalistic
evaluations such as the DATOS-A effort have the advan-
tage of representing patients and services in the real world,
thereby strengthening the external validity of research
findings and enhancing the generalizability of find-
ings.17,18 The limitations of such research are that nei-
ther treatment modalities nor types of programs that pa-
tients enter are controlled. The DATOS-A sample of
programs was purposive, intending to represent stable
programs of specific types operating in the communi-
ties, rather than designed to be representative of all ado-
lescent treatment programs. Thus, the study results may
not be generalizable to programs that are not similar to
those that participated in DATOS-A. Other limitations
include the following: a 33% loss of sample at 1 year of
posttreatment follow-up; the fact that study results are
mostly based on self-report; and the fact that treatment
effects may be somewhat inflated, particularly for pa-
tients in RES programs because those patients lost to fol-
low-up seemed to have shorter lengths of stay in treat-
ment than those who completed follow-up interviews.
Nevertheless, naturalistic studies such as DATOS-A that
routinely monitor and evaluate typical treatment pro-
grams for adolescent patients who abuse drugs are needed.
They provide the information necessary for developing
strategies that improve treatment and treatment poli-
cies. The present DATOS-A study makes an important
contribution to our understanding of adolescents' drug
use and their outcomes in drug treatment. The results
of the present study further underscore the importance
of evaluations of adolescent treatment that consider ado-
lescent-specific issues such as different patterns of alco-
hol and drug use; the roles of family, school, and peers;
developmental processes; and the types of treatment ado-
lescent patients are referred to.
