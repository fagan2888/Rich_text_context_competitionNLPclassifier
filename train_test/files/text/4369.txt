In some instances, government formation is rather swift
and short; in others it is characterized by lengthy negotia-
tions and inconclusive formation attempts (De Winter and
Dumont, 2008). Excessive delays in the bargaining pro-
cess may weaken democratic accountability (Conrad and
Golder, 2010; Martin and Vanberg, 2003) when caretaker
cabinets lacking a popular mandate and having only lim-
ited policy-making capacities are in power for a long time.
The government formation stage also has implications for
other aspects of coalition politics (De Winter and Dumont,
2008; Martin and Vanberg, 2003), in particular for gov-
ernment duration (e.g. Grofman and van Roozendaal,
1994). Delays in government formation may also affect
the economy by increasing investor uncertainties in for-
eign exchange markets (Bernhard and Leblang, 2002) and
investment risks in stock markets (Bechtel, 2009).
Although many studies analyse government formation
(e.g. Bäck and Dumont, 2008; Martin and Stevenson, 2001)
and termination (e.g. Saalfeld, 2008), there is little research
identifying the causes of long bargaining cycles. The few
existing studies (Diermeier and van Roozendaal, 1998;
Golder, 2010; Martin and Vanberg, 2003) focus on parlia-
mentary democracies in Western Europe. However, as noted
by Laver and Schofield (1998), a potential challenge of coa-
lition research is to develop and test theories based on the
same universe of observations. This entails an inductive
element in theory-building based on data `which has by now
been very thoroughly picked over' (Laver and Schofield,
1998: 8).
This article uses new data from Central and Eastern
Europe (CEE) to test theories explaining delays in govern-
ment formation developed in Western Europe. Overall,
these new data provide only limited evidence for existing
approaches to explain the length of government formation
processes. In particular, we find that uncertainty in the bar-
gaining process leads to longer formation processes
(Diermeier and van Roozendaal, 1998), although this effect
is weaker in CEE. In contrast, we find no coherent evidence
that the complexity of the bargaining situation affects the
duration of government formation processes (Martin and
Vanberg, 2003). Finally, bargaining uncertainty conditions
the impact of complexity in the bargaining context (and
vice versa) in Western Europe (Golder, 2010), while there
are no such conditional effects in CEE. The implications of
these findings and potential avenues for future research are
discussed in the final section.
The duration of government formation
processes in Europe

Abstract
Although many studies analyse government formation and termination, there is only scant attention to the duration of
government formation processes. The few existing studies focus on the empirical evidence of parliamentary democracies
in Western Europe until 1998. We present a new data set on 297 government formation processes in 27 European
countries that allows us to test models explaining delays in the government formation process developed in Western
Europe using new data from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Our results suggest that these models perform much
better in the Western European heartland of coalition studies than in the context of CEE. We highlight the implications
of these findings and discuss potential avenues for future research.

The role of uncertainty and
complexity in government formation
processes
From the perspective of bargaining models with incomplete
information, the duration of government formation is pri-
marily determined by the degree of uncertainty about key
parameters (Diermeier and van Roozendaal, 1998). Political
actors may face uncertainty about their competitors' policy
preferences, outside options, and objectives (De Winter and
Dumont, 2008; Strøm, 1994). In bargaining situations
where parties know little about their mutual policy prefer-
ences and office payoffs, government formation is likely to
be characterized by considerable delays. Government for-
mation in these contexts features a series of proposals and
counter proposals where the negotiating parties accumulate
information about their partners'preferences and what kind
of compromise is acceptable for them. The delay may also
serve as a costly signal to the bargaining parties (and their
rank-and-file) that other, more advantageous offers have
not been acceptable for all bargaining partners. In contrast,
a bargaining situation in which parties have reliable infor-
mation concerning their mutual preferences and payoffs is
likely to be characterized by a swift and short government
formation process.
A competing theoretical perspective emphasizes the
influence of the complexity of the bargaining environment
on the length of inter-party negotiations (Martin and
Vanberg, 2003). A complex situation would be coalition
talks including numerous parties with highly heterogene-
ous policy profiles. Due to the ideological incompatibility,
agreeing on a joint policy platform is likely to be time-con-
suming, resulting in a long government formation period.
At the same time, the larger the number of parties, the more
difficult it becomes to reach agreement on policy and the
allocation of ministerial portfolios. In contrast, fewer par-
ties ­ with similar policy positions ­ constitute a simpler
bargaining situation, where negotiations should conclude
swiftly and without considerable delays.
Golder (2010) combines both approaches, arguing that
the effect of bargaining complexity is conditional on the
level of uncertainty: while uncertainty always leads to
longer government formation processes, the complexity of
the bargaining situation increases the time required for gov-
ernment formation only in situations where the political par-
ties involved are uncertain about their counterparts'
preferences. Specifically, assembling the required informa-
tion on all potential coalition partners' policy and office
preferences will take considerably longer when more parties
are involved in coalition bargaining. The effect of complex-
ity is therefore determined by the level of uncertainty, and
vice versa. This implies that the marginal effect of bargain-
ing uncertainty depends on the level of complexity (Berry
et al., 2012). While a higher level of uncertainty should
always increase the duration of government formation
(Golder, 2010), this effect is strongest in complex bargain-
ing situations. These theoretical insights may be summa-
rized as follows.
Hypothesis 1: Bargaining uncertainty increases the
duration of government formation.
Hypothesis 2: Bargaining complexity increases the
duration of government formation.
Hypothesis 3: The effect of bargaining uncertainty on
the duration of government formation depends on the
level of complexity: uncertainty increases the duration
of government formation at all levels of bargaining com-
plexity, but its effect is strongest in complex bargaining
situations.
Hypothesis 4: The effect of bargaining complexity on
the duration of government formation depends on the
level of uncertainty: complexity increases the duration
of government formation if bargaining uncertainty is
high, while there is no or less of an effect if bargaining
uncertainty is low.
Data and methods
We use a new data set on 297 government formation pro-
cesses in 27 European democracies to test these hypotheses.
Specifically, we study 158 formation processes in Bulgaria,
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, starting with the
first fully democratically elected government.1
Based on the ERD data set (Andersson et al., 2014)
we also collect analogous data for 139 government for-
mation processes in 17 Western European countries for
the period 1990­2014. This allows us to compare the
empirical results for the Western European heartland of
coalition studies with new data from Central and Eastern
Europe.
The operationalization of the key dependent variable
closely follows that of the existing literature on bargain-
ing duration (Diermeier and van Roozendaal, 1998;
Golder, 2010). Bargaining duration is thus defined as the
time period between the end of the previous and the start
of the current government. For post-election governments
the start of the bargaining period coincides with the date
of the parliamentary election.2 For inter-election govern-
ments the termination of the previous government ­ and
thus the beginning of the bargaining period ­ is deter-
mined by any change in the government's party composi-
tion or a change of the prime minister (Müller and Strøm,
2000: 12). Moreover, the minimum length of inter-party
bargaining in situations where a new government is trig-
gered by one or more parties leaving or joining a govern-
ment is set to one day.
The empirical analyses feature an indicator variable for
post-election status capturing the effect of bargaining
Ecker and Meyer 3
uncertainty. Following Golder (2010), the level of bargain-
ing complexity of each bargaining process is captured
using two variables: the number of effective parliamentary
parties and the ideological polarization in the legislature.3
The former is estimated using the standard formula and
seat shares as legislative weights (Laakso and Taagepera,
1979). The latter is calculated as suggested by Dalton
(2008). In this context, data on the ideological positions of
political parties are retrieved using the MARPOR general
left­right scale (Volkens et al., 2015).4 Finally, all empiri-
cal models feature two control variables. The first is an
indicator variable for bargaining situations following early
parliamentary elections, as these may be partly endoge-
nous to the following government formation process. The
second control variable is used to control for `majority
situations' in which a single party controls a majority of
the seats in the legislature (see Golder, 2010; Martin and
Vanberg, 2003) and potentially no `real' inter-party bar-
gaining occurs.5
Given the nature of our dependent variable, the effect of
all independent variables is estimated via Cox proportional-
hazard models with bargaining-time as a dependent varia-
ble. Because all inter-party negotiations are eventually
brought to an end and no ongoing bargaining processes are
included in our sample, all observations `fail' and thus no
complex regime for right-censored observations needs to
be devised.6 Finally, the interpretation of proportional haz-
ard rates ­ the standard coefficients in survival analysis ­ in
the context of bargaining duration is somewhat counterin-
tuitive. Here, negative coefficients reduce the risk that
negotiations are brought to an end at any point in time,
given that they are still ongoing at that time. Thus, negative
coefficients denote factors that extend the bargaining dura-
tion, while positive coefficients indicate elements reducing
the length of inter-party bargaining.
Empirical analysis
Figure 1 shows the distribution of our dependent variable,
bargaining duration, across and within countries. On aver-
age, government formation in the Netherlands (90 days)
and Austria (75 days) takes substantially longer than in
Denmark (4 days), Greece (3 days), and France (2 days).
There is also considerable variation within countries, with
the top 5% of the bargaining processes lasting for 95 days
or more. The average bargaining duration of countries in
Central and Eastern Europe falls within these extremes: the
average formation duration in the Czech Republic (39 days)
is similar to that of Belgium (43 days), Spain (42 days), and
Luxembourg (37 days). With an average of 19 days, the
duration of government formation was rather short in
Romania and Slovakia; this is about the same time it takes
to form governments in Ireland (20 days) and Finland (18
days). The dashed lines in Figure 1 show the average length
of formation processes in Western Europe and in Central
and Eastern Europe. In general, bargaining duration in CEE

and Eastern Europe (CEE).
4 Research and Politics 
(29 days) is similar to the average length of government
formation processes in Western Europe (28 days).
Figure 2 shows the relationships between uncertainty,
complexity, and bargaining duration. The left panel shows
the average bargaining duration for inter-election (grey
bars) and post-election bargaining situations (black bars).
Coalition talks after parliamentary elections in Western
Europe (40 days) take on average eight times longer than
negotiations in an inter-election context (five days). In
Central and Eastern Europe, this difference between post-
election and inter-election bargaining is substantially
smaller. Here, coalition talks after elections take roughly
twice as long as negotiations between elections (43 vs. 18
days). While these patterns support the claim that uncer-
tainty affects the duration of government formation pro-
cesses (Hypothesis 1), the effect is weaker in the data
collected for Central and Eastern Europe.
The right panel in Figure 2 distinguishes low complex-
ity (effective number of parties below mean; grey bars)
from high complexity bargaining situations (effective
number of parties at or above mean; black bars). There is
some evidence to support the claim that government for-
mation takes longer in complex bargaining situations
(Hypothesis 2). Yet, this effect is only visible in Western
Europe (22 vs. 38 days), but not in Central and Eastern
Europe. Here, complexity seems to have no positive effect
on delays in the government formation process (31 vs. 27
days).
Figure 3 explores the conditional effects of uncertainty
and complexity on the duration of government formation
processes. Again, there is mixed empirical evidence for the
conditional effects (Hypotheses 3 and 4). The patterns in
Western Europe corresponded to findings from earlier stud-
ies (Golder 2010): uncertainty (i.e., post-election status)
increases the time it takes to form a government, but this
effect is strongest in complex bargaining situations
(Hypothesis 3). Vice versa, increasing complexity has little
or no effect in inter-election periods (grey bars) when
uncertainty is low. It is only in post-election bargaining
situations (black bars) that increasing complexity leads to
longer bargaining duration (Hypothesis 4). However, in the
newly collected data for Central and Eastern Europe there
is no consistent evidence for the conditional effect of uncer-
tainty and complexity. Uncertainty increases bargaining
duration, but this effect is similar in bargaining situations of
low (21 vs. 40 days) and high complexity (16 vs. 46 days).
Furthermore, complexity has almost no effect on bargain-
ing duration. Even in high uncertainty contexts (black
bars), the difference in the average bargaining duration for
less (40 days) and more complex bargaining situations (46
days) is small in absolute terms and much smaller than the
difference in Western Europe.

Note: This figure shows the average bargaining duration in days for bargaining situations in Western and Central and Eastern Europe. The left panel
further differentiates between low uncertainty (inter-election; grey bars) and high uncertainty (post-election; black bars) bargaining situations. The
right panel further differentiates between low complexity (effective number of parties below mean; grey bars) and high complexity (effective number
of parties at or above mean; grey bars) bargaining situations.
Ecker and Meyer 5
The same empirical patterns emerge from a multivariate
analysis. Table 1 shows the results of a series of Cox pro-
portional-hazard models using delays in government for-
mation as the dependent variable. Models 1 and 3 include
measures of uncertainty and complexity, thus testing
Hypothesis 1 and 2 in the context of Western Europe and of
CEE separately. Models 2 and 4 then allow the effect of
complexity to vary with the observed level of bargaining
uncertainty, thus testing Hypotheses 3 and 4 again sepa-
rately in Western Europe and in CEE. Both a global
Grambsch and Therneau (1994) test and a visual inspection
of the Schoenfeld residuals indicate that some models vio-
late the proportional hazard assumption. The corresponding
p-values of the global tests are displayed at the bottom of
Table 1. We test each covariate separately to identify the
offending covariate and account for their time-varying
effect by including interactions with the natural logarithm
of analysis-time. All empirical results are robust to these
alternative model specifications.7
Corroborating Hypothesis 1, the empirical results of
Models 1 and 3 indicate that post-election status signifi-
cantly and substantially delays the conclusion of coalition
bargaining both in Western Europe and in CEE. Yet, the
effect is weaker in the latter sample. The substantial effect of
post-election status is estimated via exponentiated coeffi-
cients (hazard ratios). In post-election contexts the risk of
government formation is approximately 81% lower in
Western Europe when compared with negotiations between
elections, while the effect is only 59% in CEE. However,
Models 1 and 3 provide no coherent empirical evidence on
the effect of complexity on delays in government formation
(Hypothesis 2). In line with previous research and the bivar-
iate analysis in Figure 2 we find a significant negative effect
of the effective number of parties in Western Europe. This
effect is not robust to alternative model specifications (see
Endnotes 3 and 6), however. Furthermore, the coefficient
for party system polarization is close to zero and does not
reach conventional levels of statistical significance. This
holds for government formation processes in Western
Europe (Model 1) and in Central and Eastern Europe
(Model 3) alike.
Equally, Models 2 and 4 provide support for the condi-
tional effects of complexity and uncertainty only in Western
Europe, but not in CEE (Hypotheses 3 and 4). Moreover,
this moderating effect is only significant for the effective
number of parties, while we find no such effect for party
system polarization. Figures 4 and 5 visualize the corre-
sponding marginal effects. Figure 4 shows the marginal
effect of uncertainty (post-election status) for different lev-
els of complexity (Hypothesis 3). The results using data
from Western Europe (left panel) show that uncertainty
reduces the risk to end the government formation process,
but this effect is strongest in complex bargaining situations.
In contrast, the data from Central and Eastern Europe (right
panel) provide no support for a conditional effect: uncer-
tainty reduce the risk of terminating the government forma-
tion process, but this effect is independent of the level of
complexity.
The left panel in Figure 5 shows the marginal effect of
the effective number of parties on bargaining duration
contingent on post-election status for government forma-
tion processes in Western Europe (Hypothesis 4).8 In low

uncertainty contexts (i.e., between elections) bargaining
complexity does not significantly affect the relative risk
of concluding coalition talks. In contrast, in high uncer-
tainty settings (i.e., after legislative elections) each addi-
tional (effective) parliamentary party is associated with a
22% decrease in the hazard of finalizing coalition negotia-
tions in Western Europe. There is no such moderating
effect of bargaining uncertainty for formation processes in
CEE (right panel in Figure 5). As indicated in the above
bivariate analysis, the data thus supported Hypothesis 4
only in Western European, but not in Central and Eastern
European democracies.
Discussion and conclusions
This article explores government formation processes in
Western and in Central and Eastern Europe. Using a new
data set we show that bargaining delays in Central and
Eastern Europe are on average as long as those in Western
Europe. Thus, in contrast to other phenomena such as gov-
ernment duration (e.g. Somer-Topcu and Williams, 2008),
party systems in Western and Central and Eastern Europe
are somewhat similar with respect to the duration of gov-
ernment formation processes.
Another important finding from this analysis is that
existing theoretical approaches explaining delays in gov-
ernment formation cannot fully account for the empirical
patterns observed in CEE. The perhaps most important
causal factor to explain the duration of formation processes
­ whether the formation process takes place in the after-
math of parliamentary elections ­ seems to play a less
decisive role in CEE. Moreover, the complexity of the bar-
gaining situation has no direct or conditional effect on bar-
gaining delays.
What are the implications of these findings for future
research on government formation processes? There are at
least two ways to respond to this question: one could chal-
lenge the underlying theoretical model or its empirical
implementation. According to the former argument, uncer-
tainty and complexity of the bargaining situation are insuf-
ficient to account for the variation in the duration of
government formation processes. Even the finding that
government formation takes longer in post-election con-
texts (Hypothesis 1) is vulnerable to alternative explana-
tions. For example, Laver and Benoit (2015) note that the
measure is somewhat endogenous because legislators
bringing down a government between elections may do so
having a preferred alternative already in mind.
Another line of reasoning would attribute non-findings
to the empirical implementation of the theoretical models.
For example, we find no evidence that ideological polariza-
tion affects the duration of government formation pro-
cesses. While this non-finding is in line with the work of
Diermeier and van Roozendaal (1998), it contrasts with
previous research identifying a link between ideological
dispersion and bargaining duration (Golder, 2010; Martin
Figure 5. Marginal effect of complexity conditional on uncertainty (Hypothesis 4).

election status. The vertical lines represent 95% confidence intervals around the median estimate from 1,000 draws using parameter and covariance
estimates obtained from Models 2 and 4, respectively.
8 Research and Politics 
and Vanberg, 2003). We can only speculate about the rea-
sons for these differences. They may be due to case selec-
tion or different measurement approaches. For instance,
there are several polarization indices, and inferences on
ideological polarization are often sensitive to the chosen
polarization index (Best and Dow, 2015). Moreover, some
scholars rely on party manifestos to measure party policy
positions, while others use expert judgments.
More generally, both uncertainty and complexity are
somewhat complex concepts that are captured using rather
crude proxy measures. For example, the post-election
dichotomy is a proxy measure suggesting that the bargain-
ing structure in inter-election periods is relatively stable.
However,incontextsofhighturnoveroftheelite(Gherghina,
2015; Semenova et al., 2014) and greater party system insta-
bility and frequent party switching (Kreuzer and Pettai,
2003; Lewis, 2000; Mair, 1997; Spirova, 2007), this assump-
tion is actually not met (see also Curini and Pinto, 2014).
Similarly, the existence of communist successor parties
(Druckman and Roberts, 2007) and the relatively high num-
ber of pre-electoral coalitions (Chiru, 2015; Ibenskas, 2015)
render standard measures of complexity rather inefficient.
More elaborated indicators for uncertainty and complex-
ity would also differ across coalition alternatives. While cur-
rent indicators vary across government formation processes,
we can shift perspectives to analyse individual bargaining
attempts that include a particular set of parties (Diermeier
and van Roozendaal, 1998). Factors such as ideological con-
flict, the number of bargaining parties, and elite turnover are
captured more adequately at this lower level of analysis. For
instance, parliamentary elections may result in substantial
turnover of the elite at the level of the party-system, indicat-
ing high levels of bargaining uncertainty. At the same time,
however, the parties actually involved in coalition bargaining
may be those which did not experience any change in party
leadership (because they are less likely to have incurred sub-
stantial electoral losses). We believe that this shift in perspec-
tives is a promising avenue for future research on government
formation processes.

Notes
1. The data were collected under the auspices of two research
projects: `Governments in Europe' (PI: Torbjörn Bergman)
and `Coalition governance in Central Eastern Europe' (PI:
Wolfgang C Müller).
2. For two-round parliamentary elections we use the date of
the second round because this is often the decisive round
only after which the actual distribution of bargaining power
within the legislature is revealed to all political parties.
3. Laver and Benoit (2015) suggested a typology of legislative
party systems as alternative measure for the complexity of
bargaining situations in the context of coalition formation.
Table 1A in the supplementary file presents the empirical
results based on this alternative operationalization of bar-
gaining complexity. All key findings discussed below are
robust.
4. We exclude bargaining situations for which no sufficient data
on the ideological position of political parties is available (i.e.
parties jointly holding less than 75% of the legislative seats).
This affects two bargaining situations in Western Europe
and 16 bargaining situations in CEE, which are mostly
more recent bargaining situations after 2010. In particular,
this includes all bargaining situations in Latvia since 2006
where no positional data are available. All empirical results
are robust according to two alternative model specifications:
(1) using a lower threshold, i.e. parties jointly controlling at
least 50% of the legislative seats; see Table 2A in the supple-
mentary file; and (2) using the full samples by including the
effective number of parliamentary parties as sole measure of
bargaining complexity; see Table 3A in the supplementary
file.
5. This applies to a small fraction of the bargaining processes in
our sample both in Western Europe (19 out of 139, i.e. 13.7%)
and Central and Eastern Europe (14 out of 158, i.e. 8.4%).
6. A likelihood-ratio test indicates that whilst there is signifi-
cant within-group correlation of observations at the coun-
try level in Western Europe this is not the case in Central
Eastern Europe. Table 4A in the supplementary file presents
the results of an alternative model specification with shared
frailties in order to account for unobserved (institutional)
characteristics at the country level, which may systematically
affect the duration of the government formation process. All
findings are robust to this alternative model specification.
7. See Table 5A in the supplementary file.
8. All marginal effects are obtained using simulation procedures
based on the parameter and covariance estimates obtained
from Models 2 and 4; see Licht (2011) for additional infor-
