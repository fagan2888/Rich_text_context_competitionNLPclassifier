Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors
Among US Adolescents, 199922008
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Overweight and obese
children have a higher prevalence of several cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk factors. There is growing evidence
demonstrating that CVD risk factors present during childhood
persist into adulthood.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: US adolescents had no significant
change in prehypertension/hypertension and borderline-high/ high
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol prevalence from 1999­2000 to
2007­2008; however, prediabetes/diabetes increased by 14%.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: Overweight and obesity during adolescence are associated
with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.
The objective of this study was to examine the recent trends in the
prevalence of selected biological CVD risk factors and the prevalence
of these risk factors by overweight/obesity status among US
adolescents.
METHODS: The NHANES is a cross-sectional, stratified, multistage
probability sample survey of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized
population. The study sample included 3383 participants aged 12 to
19 years from the 1999 through 2008 NHANES.
RESULTS: Among the US adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, the overall
prevalence was 14% for prehypertension/hypertension, 22% for
borderline-high/high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 6% for low
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (,35 mg/dL), and 15% for
prediabetes/diabetes during the survey period from 1999 to 2008. No
significant change in the prevalence of prehypertension/hypertension
(17% and 13%) and borderline-high/high low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (23% and 19%) was observed from 1999­2000 to 2007­2008,
but the prevalence of prediabetes/diabetes increased from 9% to 23%.
A consistent dose-response increase in the prevalence of each of these
CVD risk factors was observed by weight categories: the estimated 37%,
49%, and 61% of the overweight, obese, and normal-weight adolescents,
respectively, had at least 1 of these CVD risk factors during the 1999
through 2008 study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this national study indicate that US ado-
lescents carry a substantial burden of CVD risk factors, especially those
youth who are overweight or obese. Pediatrics 2012;129:1035­1041

ARTICLE
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the
leading cause of death among adults in
the United States. Although its overt
manifestations, such as heart attack
and stroke, do not usually emerge until
adulthood, CVD risk factors are often
present during childhood and adoles-
cence.1 A recent report indicated that
8% of US adolescents aged 12 to 19
years had high low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (LDL-C) in 1999­2006;
similarly, 8% had a low high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level.2
Seven percent and 14% of US adoles-
centsin2001­2006hadprehypertension/
hypertension and elevated fasting glu-
cose, respectively, in the nationally rep-
resentative study.3
Currently, the most prevalent CVD risk
factors observed among adolescents are
overweight and obesity. In 200922010,
anestimated34%ofUSadolescentsaged
12 to 19 years were overweight or
obese.4 Overweight and obesity have
negative health consequences that ex-
tend beyond excess body fat and cos-
metic concerns. Research indicates
that being overweight or obese may
place adolescents at increased risk for
CVD risk factors such as hypertension,5
abnormal lipid levels,6 prediabetes/
diabetes,7 and increased C-reactive
protein.8,9 Because CVD risks present
during this period may track into
adulthood,10 it is important to have
an understanding of the problem
among adolescents. However, no infor-
mation on recent trends and preva-
lence of biological CVD risk factors by
weight status is available among US
adolescents.
The current study focuses on CVD risk
factors using nationally representative
datatodetermineprevalenceofbiological
CVD risk factors (prehypertension/
hypertension, borderline-high/high LDL-C,
low HDL-C, and prediabetes/diabetes) by
weight status (normal weight, over-
weight, obese) and their trends among
US adolescents aged 12 to 19 years. We
alsoexaminetheclusteringof theseCVD
risk factors among overweight and
obese adolescents.
METHODS
Participants and Methods
The data used were from the NHANES,
a nationally representative, continuous
cross-sectionalsurveyofthehealthand
nutritional status of the US civilian,
noninstitutionalized population. Annu-
ally, 6000 persons are selected to
participate by using a complex, multi-
stage probability design. The survey
oversamples non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans. NHANES data are
released in 2-year increments; this
analysis was conducted with data from
5 cycles: 1999­2000, 2001­2002, 2003­
2004, 2005­2006, and 200722008.
Across all 5 cycles, 78% of those se-
lected completed the physical exami-
nation component in an NHANES mobile
examination center.
All participants in NHANES completed
a standardized household interview
and a detailed physical examination,
including anthropometric and blood
pressure measurements, and were in-
vited to the mobile examination center.
Those who were randomly assigned to
the morning session, which required
afastingbloodsample,wereinstructed
to fast overnight for 8 to 24 hours.In the
current study, only those who had fas-
ted at least 8 hours before blood was
taken were included in the fasting sam-
ple. Data for this group were weighted to
account for the complex survey design
and nonresponse. Participants 18 years
and older provided written informed
consent.Forparticipantsunder18years,
parents also provided written informed
consent.
The initial combined sample for the 5
cycles included 10 397 adolescents
who took part in home interviews and
were examined at mobile examination
centers. Of this group, 4174 were ran-
domly selected to provide fasting blood
samples for lipid and glucose testing.
Those who reported being pregnant,
had a positive urine pregnancy test
(73), or were missing data (718) were
excluded from the sample. The final
analytical sample included 3383 ado-
lescents (Table 1).
Measurement and Definitions of
CVD Risk Factors
Weight Status
Using height and weight, which were
obtained by trained interviewers dur-
ingthephysicalexaminations,andself-
reported gender and age obtained
during home interviews, adolescents
were classified as being overweight or
obese according to Centers for Disease
Control age- and gender-specific per-
centiles for BMI.11 Overweight was de-
fined as having a BMI percentile of
$85th and ,95th percentile, and obe-
sity was defined as being $95th per-
centile. Normal weight was defined as
a BMI percentile $5th to ,85th per-
centile. Underweight youth (BMI ,5th
percentile) were excluded from the
analyses.

Prehypertension/Hypertension
Systolic(SBP)anddiastolic(DBP)blood
pressure were used to identify ado-
lescents who were prehypertensive/
hypertensive based on an average of
up to 3 measurements that took place
during the physical examination. For
adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, guide-
lines established by the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute that were
specificforage,gender,andheight were
used to define prehypertension and
hypertension.12 Prehypertension for
this age group was defined as having
a SBP or DBP reading that was $90th
percentile to ,95th percentile, and hy-
pertension as having an SBP or DBP
$95th percentile. Adolescents aged
18 to 19 years were classified as pre-
hypertensive if they had an SBP $120
mm Hg to #139 mm Hg or a DBP $80
mm Hg to#89 mm Hgand hypertensive
if they had a SBP $140 mm Hg or a DBP
$90 mm Hg.
Abnormal Lipid Levels
Borderline-high, high LDL-C, and low
HDL-C were defined with standards
established by the National Cholesterol
Education Program and the American
Heart Association that were incorpor-
ated in the American Academy of Pedi-
atrics(AAP)lipidscreeningguidelinesfor
children and adolescents.13 Adolescents
were classified as having borderline-
high or high LDL-C if their level was
$110 to ,129 mg/dL or $130 mg/dL,
respectively. HDL-C levels ,35 mg/dL
were considered low.
Prediabetes/Diabetes
Recommendations from the American
Diabetes Association were used to
classify adolescents with prediabetes/
diabetes.14 Those with a fasting plasma
glucose level .99 mg/dL to ,126 mg/
dL were classified as adolescents with
prediabetes, and those with a level
$126 mg/dL were classified as ado-
lescents with diabetes. Given changes
in the equipment used to measure
glucose levels in the NHANES in the
200322004 study cycle, a correction
factor was applied to fasting glucose
data for the 200522006 (fasting glucose
3 0.9838) and 200722008 (fasting glu-
cose=0.98383[fastingglucose21.139])
cycles to allow foraccurate estimation of
trends in the prevalence of prediabetes
and diabetes.1 Youth who reported that
they were diagnosed as being diabetic
were also classified as adolescents with
diabetes.
Demographic Characteristics
Demographic characteristics, including
gender, age in years, and race/ethnicity,
were self-reported during the home
interview; classifications were non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic,Asian/PacificIslander,orother
(eg,multipleraces).AdolescentsofAsian
descent and those self-classified as
other are included in the overall analy-
ses, but individual estimates for these 2
groups are not reported because of the
small samples, unstable estimates, and
within group diversity.
Data Analysis
First, we estimated the population
prevalence and standard errors of the
demographic characteristics and the
prevalence of BMI categories (normal,
overweight, and obesity) for the entire
sample (Table 1). Second, the propor-
tion of adolescents with 1 of 4 CVD risk
factors (prehypertension/hypertension,
borderline-high/high LDL, low HDL,
prediabetes/diabetes) was examined for
the entire sample and then stratified
based on BMI category (Fig 1). Third, we
tested for differences in the prevalence
of each of the 4 CVD risk factors pre-
viously mentioned and of overweight
and obesity across the 5 study cycles
(199922000 referent year) by using x2
tests (Table 2). Significant differences in
the number of these 4 CVD risk factors
(0, 1, 2, or $3 risk factors) as a function
of weight status and demographic fac-
tors were assessed by using x2 tests
(Table 3). The Bonferroni method was
used to account for multiple compar-
isons. Finally, we assessed combinations
of$2ofthese4CVDriskfactors(11total
possible combinations) among over-
weight and obese youth by examining
their prevalence and clustering (Table 4).
Analyses were conducted by using
SUDAAN statistical software to account
for nonresponse and the complex sam-
pling design of NHANES. Given limitations
in the availability and continuity of data
available between 1999 and 2008 for
diet, physical activity, and smoking, these
factors were not examined.
RESULTS
Among the 3383 adolescents in the
study, there were slightly more boys
than girls (Table 1; weighted data), and
age was evenly distributed over the 2-
year categories. Nearly two-thirds were
non-Hispanic whites, and 34% of the
study group was overweight or obese.
The overall prevalence for each of the 4
risk factors was .10%, with the ex-
ception of low HDL-C (Fig 1). Borderline-
high/high LDL-C was the most prevalent
risk factor overall (22%), and a dose-
response increase was observed be-
tween abnormal LDL-C (ie, borderline-high
or high) and weight classification, as
percentages were 18%, normal weight;
28%, overweight; and 32%, obese.
Similarly, dose-response increase with
weight category was observed for
prehypertension/hypertension, low HDL-
C, and prediabetes/diabetes. In addition,
a dose-response increase was observed
between weight category and having
$2 CVD risk factors. There was no sig-
nificant change in the prevalence of
overweight, obesity, prehypertension,
hypertension, borderline-high LDL-C, or
high LDL-C (Table 2), but a significant
decrease in low HDL-C (from 9% to 3%;
P , .05) was observed when comparing
the prevalence of each risk factor in

1999­2000 to the prevalence of sub-
sequent study cycles. During the same
period, the prevalence of prediabetes/
diabetes (combined given the small
number of adolescents with diabetes)
increased significantly (from 9% to 23%;
P , .05). No other significant differ-
ences were found in the prevalence
of each of 4 CVD risk factors within each
combination of 2 study cycles (1999­
2000 vs 2003­2004, 2001­2002 vs 2003­
2004, etc). In all, 43% of adolescents had
at least 1 biological CVD risk factor
(Table 3). Significant differences were
observed by demographic character-
istics in the distribution of the number
risk factors by adolescent gender, age,
and BMI. Boys were more likely than
girls to have 1, 2, or $3 risk factors. In
addition, a higher percentage of older
adolescents (18219 years) had $2 risk
factors than did the youngest adoles-
cents (12213 years). A consistent dose-
response increase in the prevalence

of each of these CVD risk factors was
observed by weight categories: the
estimated 37%, 49%, and 61% of the
overweight, obese, and normal-weight
adolescents, respectively, had at least 1
of these CVD risk factors during the
1999­2008 period of study. A signifi-
cantly greater proportion of overweight
and obese adolescents (vs those of
normal weight) had 2 risk factors, and
obese youth but not their overweight
peers were more likely to have $3 risk
factors than were those of normal weight.
There were no significant differences in
the prevalence of various numbers of
CVD biological risk factors based on
race/ethnicity.
Of the 11 possible combinations of CVD
riskfactorsexaminedamongoverweight
and obese adolescents, the most com-
mon, prehypertension/hypertension
(BP in table) and borderline-high/
high LDL-C, accounted for just over
one-fourth (Table 4). Other common
combinations in this population in-
cluded borderline-high/high LDL-C and
prediabetes/diabetes, prehypertension/
hypertension and prediabetes/diabetes,
and borderline-high/high LDL-C and low
HDL-C.
DISCUSSION
TheresultsofthisstudyindicatethatUS
adolescents bear a substantial burden
of risk factors for CVD. In our nationally
representative study, 49% of the over-
weight and 61% of the obese adoles-
cents had $1 CVD risk factors in
addition to their weight status during
the 1999­2008 period of study. We
found that the prevalence of CVD risk
factors among normal-weight adoles-
cents was lower than among those
who were overweight or obese, an es-
timated 37% of normal-weight adoles-
cents had at least 1 CVD risk factor. Thus,
the results presented here indicate that
from a population level, a large propor-
tion of adolescents, regardless of weight
status, would benefit from interventions
such as Let's Move15,16 and programs that
promote overall healthy lifestyles, in-
cluding physical activity, healthy diet,
and healthy weight maintenance.
Our findings are concerning given
growing evidence demonstrating that
CVD risk factors present during child-
hood may persist into adulthood.10
Moreover, atherosclerosis, a complex,
multifactorial disease that affects mil-
lions of adults, may be first observed in
childhood as atherosclerotic changes
on the arterial wall.17 Carotid intima-
media thickness, a measure of sub-
clinical atherosclerosis, was found to be
increased in children with CVD risk fac-
tors, especially if multiple risk factors
were present.18 However, the adoption of
healthy lifestyle behaviors appears to be
promising as a counteractive force. For
example, results from the Cardiovascu-
lar Risk in Young Finns cohort, which
consisted of 1809 subjects who were
followed up for 27 years since baseline
(1980, age 3­18 years), found that fre-
quent fruit consumption plus high
physical activity in childhood was asso-
ciated with an increase in the HDL/LDL
cholesterol ratio, a decrease in BMI from
childhood to adulthood, and reduced
progression of intima-media thickness.19
Our results indicating that the preva-
lenceofprehypertension/hypertension
and borderline-high/high LDL-C did not
change from 199922000 to 200722008

are encouraging. In contrast, we found
that the prevalence of prediabetes/
diabetes increased during this period,
but this result should be interpreted
with caution, given the approach used.
We identified prediabetes/diabetes by
using a single fasting blood glucose
value, which may be a relatively unreli-
able measure in children.20 Further-
more, a decrease in the prevalence of
low HDL-C was observed, but whether
thiswas a true decline is not known. The
decrease may have been related to
changes in the protocol used to de-
termine HDL-C in NHANES.21
The plateauing of the prevalence of
several CVD risk factors is not sur-
prising when one considers that the
prevalence of obesity, a frequent pre-
cursor to the risk factors examined
here, did not increase significantly for
most youth in our or another NHANES
study.4 Another state-level report has
also indicated small declines in the
prevalence of obesity among youth.22
Results suggesting a leveling off or
decline in obesity may be related to
increased attention to and awareness
of obesity in the general population.
Obesity prevention efforts focusing on
individual and environmental changes
may have been beneficial in helping to
control CVD risk factors among US
adolescents. In a recommendation is-
sued in 2010, the US Preventive Services
Task Force proposed to screen children
aged $6 years for obesity and offer/
refer them to comprehensive, moder-
ate to intense behavioral interventions
for weight control.23 In 2011, the AAP
issued Expert Panel on Integrated Guide-
lines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk
Reduction in Children and Adolescents.10
The guidelines recommend classifying
children's weight starting at age 2 years.
Intensified diet and physical activity for
8 months is suggested for children aged
$5 years with BMI percentiles $85.10
Screening for diabetes is also recom-
mended among all children 10 years and
older with BMI percentiles $85, weight
for height, or weight .120% of ideal for
height by using fasting blood glucose.10
Both guidelines, however, recommend
using BMI percentiles11 for screening
overweight/obesity. Still, concern has
been expressed that obesity is under-
recognized and undertreated by pedia-
tricians in primary care. According to
a nationally representative survey, al-
though 99% of respondents reported
measuring height and weight at well
visits, only 52% of them used BMI per-
centiles for children aged .2 years.
Pediatricians in large practices and
those with recent obesity training were
more likely to screen for obesity by us-
ing BMI percentiles.24
Previous studies indicate that obese
children are more likely than their
peers to be screened for certain CVD
risk factors,25 but prehypertension/
hypertension are often underdiag-
nosed.26 This is disconcerting, given
the recommendation by the National
High Blood Pressure Education Pro-
gram and the AAP that children .3
years have their blood pressure mea-
suredaspart of any healthcarevisit.10,12
These guidelines also suggest differ-
entiating between primary and sec-
ondary hypertension in all children
with diagnosed hypertension through
a comprehensive diagnostic panel. The
limited availability of data in the
NHANES study precluded us from dis-
tinguishing these 2 types of hyperten-
sion. However, a retrospective study
using a different population found that
primary hypertension was the most
prevalent type of hypertension in chil-
dren aged 8 to 18 years and that it often
coexisted with a positive family history
for hypertension, an elevated BMI, and
hypercholesterolemia.27 In our study,
having a borderline-high/high LDL-C level
was the most prevalent CVD biological
risk factor for adolescents. The AAP ex-
pert panel recommends universal lipid
screening for all children aged 9 to 11
years and adolescents 17 to 21 years
using nonfasting or fasting blood sam-
ples.10 For children 2 to 8 years and
adolescents 12 to 16 years, lipid screen-
ing is suggested if there is a family his-
tory of premature CVD, high cholesterol,
high BMI, diabetes, hypertension, or if
youth smoke or have conditions pre-
disposing to accelerated atheroscle-
rosis and early CVD.10 Thus, these
recommendations addressed several
concerns that have been raised pre-
viously regarding lipid screening in
the pediatric population, including the
low sensitivity of BMI or known family
history as a criterion for cholesterol
screening, changes in lipid concentra-
tions during puberty, and using a non-
fasting lipid profile for screening.28
The US Preventive Services Task Force
has recognized that the benefits and
potential long-term harms of lipid
screening, low-fat diets, and lipid-
lowering medications among children
have not been studied adequately. Ac-
cordingly, the Task Force has not made
any recommendation for or against
lipid screening among children and
adolescents.29
Severallimitationsofthisreportshould
beconsidered.First,ourexaminationof
CVD risk factors was not exhaustive; we
focused on biological risk factors only.
The emergence of CVD is multifactorial
and determined in part by biological
risk factors; other factors such as
family history and behaviors (eg, diet,
physical activity, smoking) are also
importantbutwerenotexaminedinthis
study because these behavioral risks
were not available in this dataset for
this time period. BMI percentiles and
the other biological risk factors ex-
amined in this study lend themselves
to easy, quick, and objective mea-
surement of CVD risk in the clinical set-
ting. The measurements of height and
weight that we used to calculate BMI
were standardized in our study, and
BMI is highly correlated with fatness.

However, there are other measures
that may be better than BMI in pre-
dictingCVDriskfactorsinchildrenand
adolescents; specifically, measures of
central obesity, including waist cir-
cumference and waist-to-height ratio,
may be superior.30 Finally, given the
limited number of nationally represen-
tative studies reporting the prevalence
of CVD risk factors stratified by adoles-
cent weight status and variability in
definitions and/or range of ages in-
cluded, it is difficult to compare the
results of this study regarding secular
trends with previous research. This
highlights the need for initiating sur-
veillance of CVD risk factors among
adolescents.
The results of this national study indicate
that US adolescents carry a substantial
burden of CVD risk factors, especially
thoseyouthwhoareoverweightorobese.
Adolescence represents a window of
opportunity for assessment of CVD risk
factors and the promotion of lifestyles
that will affect the development and
progression of CVD.
