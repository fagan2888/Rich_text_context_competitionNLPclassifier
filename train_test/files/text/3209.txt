Research Question
What happens when fiscal and/or monetary policy rules change dramatically? According
to the predominant economic theory, rational agents, i.e. firms and households realize
the magnitude of those policy changes immediately. We put forth another economic
theory and model agents with incomplete information about those policy rules. We are
specifically interested in the arising transition dynamics from one policy regime to the
next and the difference with respect to the full information setup.
Contribution
We study two stylized examples of policy transitions: one is motivated by the Volcker
disinflation and studies the change of a monetary policy rule from a situation which would
imply indeterminacy under full-information rational expectations to values which imply
determinacy. The second example we look at is a transition from a regime of monetary
dominance to one of fiscal dominance.
Results
A key result of this paper is that random walk-like behavior can endogenously arise in
those models which under full information, would only feature stationary dynamics. In
the first example, economic agents might believe that equilibrium indeterminacy persists
for substantial periods and, in the second example, agents are led to believe that the
economy is temporarily explosive. We show that under uncertainty the latter policy
scenario implies behavior of inflation and debt that is in line with observations since the
financial crisis: random walk-like behavior for debt, but also low and stable inflation. Due
to the fact that economic outcomes are different once we model a slight deviation from
full information rational expectations, policy conclusions from mainstream models should
be evaluated with some caution.

Abstract
What happens when fiscal and/or monetary policy changes systematically? We
construct a DSGE model in which agents have to estimate fiscal and monetary
policy rules and assess how uncertainty surrounding the conduct of policymakers
influences transition paths after policy changes. We find that policy changes of
the magnitude often considered in the literature can lead private agents to hold
substantially different views about the nature of equilibrium than would be predicted
by a full information analysis. In particular, random walk-like behavior can be
observed for a large number of periods in equilibrium, even though the models we
use admit stationary dynamics under full-information rational expectations.

1 Introduction
An economic theory asserts how
reduced form parameters change
when government policies change.
Thomas J. Sargent, Points of
Departure
What happens when fiscal or monetary policy rules change dramatically? Large
changes in fiscal and monetary policy rules are routinely evaluated in micro-founded dy-
namic equilibrium models (see for example Curdia and Finocchiaro (2013)). Two strong
assumptions commonly underlie such exercises: agents are initially unaware of possible
policy changes, and agents become immediately aware of the new policy rule once it is
implemented. Work on Markov-switching DSGE models, such as Bianchi (2013) and Liu,
Waggoner, and Zha (2011), dispenses of the first assumption, but retains the second. As
Sargent (2015) highlights, these assumptions represent different economic theories about
how firms and households in our models react to policy changes. We put forth another
economic theory and model agents as econometricians that have to estimate coefficients of
policy rules to remove the second assumption. We borrow the assumption of 'anticipated
utility' decision-making (Kreps (1998)) that is common in the learning literature (Sargent,
Williams, and Zha (2006), Primiceri (2005), and Milani (2007) are three examples) and
thus keep the first assumption of the standard approach in play1.
A key theme of this paper is how random walk-like behavior (i.e. the VAR representation
of the linearized equilibrium dynamics has eigenvalues equal to or slightly larger than 1)
can endogenously arise in models which under rational expectations, would only feature
stationary dynamics. This behavior arises even though agents in our model have substan-
tial knowledge of the economy and act as sophisticated econometricians to uncover those
features of the economy that they do not know about. It is the dynamics of the data in
equilibrium that make the learning problem hard, leading to differences between beliefs
of agents and the true policy rule, which in turn fuels the random walk-like behavior that
arises in equilibrium.
We study two stylized examples of policy transitions: one is motivated by the Volcker dis-
inflation and studies the change of a monetary policy rule from parameter values which
would imply indeterminacy under full-information rational expectations to values which
imply determinacy. We thus explicitly model the transition that is absent in papers that
study separately indeterminate and determinate outcomes for the US, such as Lubik and
Schorfheide (2004). Throughout this example we keep fiscal policy passive in the language
of Leeper (1991) and Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999). We revisit findings by Cogley,
Matthes, and Sbordone (2015), namely that even if agents think the economy is stable,
unstable behavior can arise if beliefs are different enough from the actual policy rule co-
efficients. We build on their findings, but use a model that allows for fiscal and monetary
policy interaction along the lines of Leeper (1991) and show that the economy in this
scenario will most likely feature random walk-like behavior rather than outright explosive

model: Their agents do observe the policy rule coefficients currently in play, but are uncertain how
persistent the current regime is.

behavior that would be rejected by the data. We also show that this behavior can persist
for many periods. It is important to emphasize that our focus here is on unusual (when
considered against the backdrop of recent policy behavior) policy changes. We are not
studying small (or 'modest') policy changes such as those emphasized by Leeper and Zha
(2003).
The second example we study is a transition from an active monetary policy/passive fiscal
policy regime to a situation where fiscal policy is active and monetary policy is passive.
We show that this policy scenario implies behavior of inflation and debt that is in line
with observations since the financial crisis: random walk-like behavior for debt, but also
low and stable inflation. These outcomes make learning about the true policy coefficients
for the monetary policy rule hard for the agents in our model, and lead to substantial
periods of confusion about the nature of equilibrium.
The agents in our model do not place any restrictions on the kind of equilibria they con-
sider (their `perceived law of motion', or PLM): both determinate and indeterminate as
well as temporarily explosive equilibria are considered as possible outcomes by our agents.
Once we remove arbitrary restrictions on the kind of equilibria considered by agents, they
can easily find themselves in situations where they mis-perceive the nature of the equi-
librium: In the first example, they might believe that equilibrium indeterminacy persists
for substantial periods and, in the second example, agents are led to believe that the
economy is temporarily explosive. Temporarily explosive dynamics can also be a feature
of a Markov-switching rational expectations model, an outcome highlighted by Bianchi
and Ilut (2013).
We endow our agents with substantial knowledge of the economy. They are only uncer-
tain about the finite dimensional policy rule parameter vector. Furthermore, we endow
them with the same knowledge of the timing of the structural change that agents in the
standard approach have: Once policy changes, firms and households suspect that policy
has indeed changed. In the standard approach, agents immediately learn the new policy
rule coefficients, so their suspicions are instantaneously confirmed. In our model, agents
instead have to estimate the new policy rule coefficients.2 We do so to minimize the differ-
ences between our approach and the standard approach outlined above. Notwithstanding,
even with this substantial knowledge of the economy, equilibrium outcomes in our envi-
ronment are substantially different from those determined using the standard approach.
We assume that private agents do not have a suspicion about the direction of the change
in the policy rule coefficients. Any announcement about the magnitude or direction of
the policy change is thus viewed as incredible by our agents.
Our focus on agents that only need to learn about the coefficients of policy rules sets this
paper apart from the earlier literature which studied monetary-fiscal policy interaction
under learning such as Eusepi and Preston (2011) and Eusepi and Preston (2013), who
instead endow their agents with less knowledge about the structure of the economy.
The interaction of fiscal and monetary policy under rational expectations in DSGE model
was pioneered by Leeper (1991). Empirical analyses include Traum and Yang (2011) and
Bhattarai, Lee, and Park (2012). We use similar models and borrow parameter estimates
from that literature, but refrain from using full-information rational expectations.
The effects of regime changes in monetary policy on beliefs and economic dynamics has

the period in which policy actually changes. Section 4 describes this in detail.

been studied in Andolfatto and Gomme (2003). Changes in fiscal policy and their ef-
fects in an RBC economy with distortionary taxation has been studied in Hollmayr and
Matthes (2013). Finally, policy uncertainty more generally has recently received substan-
tially more attention due to the work of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012), who quantify
policy uncertainty using various measures and show its impact using VARs.
Our approach is different from the previous literature in that we explicitly try to only use
minimal departure from a full information rational expectations approach, restrict the
private agents' model uncertainty to the policy rule parameters and focus on the tran-
sition dynamics rather than asymptotic results (i.e. whether equilibria are 'learnable').
The agents in our model use the Kalman Filter to estimate coefficients. We thus make
them sophisticated econometricians who could not easily improve upon their estimation
routine.
The next section uses the model in Leeper (1991) and its analytical solution to shed
some light on how changes in beliefs alter equilibrium dynamics and can lead to random
walk-like behavior. We then turn to our benchmark DSGE model before describing the
learning methodology in detail and discussing the differences between outcomes under
learning and using the standard approach.
2 An Analytical Example: Beliefs and Equilibrium
Outcomes in Leeper (1991)
In this section we highlight the key forces underlying our main results in a simpler context
that allows for analytical results - the model in Leeper (1991). We do not explicitly model
learning in this section, but instead ask a simpler question - what happens if beliefs about
policy rule coefficients held by private agents happen to be wrong? In the language of
the learning literature, the agents' perceived law of motion (PLM) differs from the actual
law of motion (ALM). Since agents in our benchmark DSGE model will be wrong about
the policy rules while they are learning about policy coefficients after a policy change,
this exercise will shed some light on the forces driving our result in the learning model
described in later sections. Here we focus on two examples: one in which agents know that
monetary policy is active and fiscal policy is passive, but do not know the exact value of the
policy rule coefficients, and a second situation in which agents still believe that monetary
policy is active and fiscal policy is passive, but the actual policy rule coefficients imply
active fiscal policy and passive monetary policy. For the first example, we will focus on
how changing beliefs can alter equilibrium dynamics more broadly, while, for the second
example, we explicitly show how and in what variables random walk-like behavior can
occur. We will revisit the second example in this section later for our benchmark DSGE
model. For analytical results that speak to the existence of non-stationary dynamics in
the first example (in which fiscal policy stays passive throughout), we refer the reader to
Cogley et al. (2015).3
3Cogley et al. (2015) do not explicitly model fiscal policy in their analytical example, but the underlying
assumption is passive fiscal policy, as is common in textbook New Keynesian models.
The form of the monetary policy rule in Leeper (1991) (where monetary policy reacts contemporaneously
to inflation) means that changes in beliefs about monetary policy (while keeping fiscal policy fixed) will
not affect the matrix multiplying lagged state variables in the equilibrium law of motion. Thus, Leeper's

Table 1: The nomenclature of equilibria and policies in Leeper (1991).
To start, it is useful to first revisit the nomenclature introduced by Leeper (1991) in order
to discriminate between different classes of equilibria under rational expectations. Table
1 does this. We describe below exactly what parameter values constitute active or passive
policy, but, broadly speaking, passive fiscal policy describes a situation in which the fiscal
authority acts to stabilize debt, whereas active monetary policy describes a situation in
which monetary policy tries to counteract inflation sufficiently.
We now turn to the economy studied in Leeper (1991). The underlying nonlinear model
is described in that paper. To summarize, it is an endowment economy that features lump-
sum taxation, money in the utility function and monetary policy that follows a Taylor
rule. For the sake of brevity, we will directly focus on the linearized system in inflation

The  parameters are convolutions of parameters and steady states and are defined in
Leeper (1991). Equation (1) is the result of combining the representative households con-
sumption Euler equation and the monetary policy rule. Equation (2) is the government's
budget constraint, where we have plugged in the optimality condition for money holdings
and the fiscal and monetary policy rules. A key parameter for our results is the discount
factor . t

To analyze the dynamics of the system, we can stack the first two equations above:5
model is less suited to showing how random walk-like behavior can arise in the example inspired by the
Volcker disinflation for our benchmark model.
4We will present the non-linear model for our benchmark case later.
5For the sake of simplicity, we do not stack the exogenous laws of motion for the shocks in the system.
Our results hold for generic laws of motion of the exogenous process as long as those processes are
stationary. Also, to determine the properties of the equilibrium dynamics, we focus on the autoregressive
matrix in the equilibrium law of motion. That matrix determines stability properties as long as there is
no root cancellation with the roots of the moving average polynomial. This turns out to be the case here.

To solve the model, we have to plug in above an expression for the one-step ahead ex-
pectations of inflation as a function of pre-determined exogenous variables or exogenous
shocks. Once we do that, the system above gives the equilibrium dynamics. The dy-
namics of the system and the nature of the prevailing equilibrium under full-information
rational expectations are governed by  and -1 - . If the first term is larger than one
in absolute value, while the second one is not, we are in a world of monetary activism and
passive fiscal policy, whereas, in the reverse case, we are in a world of active fiscal policy
(fiscal policy does not use taxes to stabilize debt) and passive monetary policy.
Leeper gives the full-information rational expectations solution for inflation and expected
inflation in the 'standard' case of active monetary policy and passive fiscal policy:

(9)
Note that fiscal shocks or the coefficient  in the fiscal policy rule do not enter either
the expected or actual inflation. This happens precisely because fiscal policy is passive.
Under rational expectations and active fiscal policy, the fiscal shocks would play a role in
determining inflation, as documented by Leeper.
2.1 The Dynamics Under a PLM When Agents Know Which
Policy is Active
We now turn to a situation where agents have incorrect beliefs about the policy rule
coefficients. As mentioned before, for simplicity we assume here that beliefs are not
updated over time, an assumption we drop later in our learning model. Just as in the
larger benchmark model that we use for our numerical work later, we assume here that
agents observe all past endogenous variables, but not the policy shocks, which the agents
have to infer based on the observable data and their beliefs about policy rule coefficients.
In this section we assume that the true policy rule coefficients indeed imply that fiscal
policy is passive and monetary policy is active, but private agents believe that the policy
rule parameters take on values that are not equal to the true values of those parameters.
Agents have a degenerate prior on the policy rule coefficients given by  and  such that
 > 1 and -1 -  < 1, but  =  and  = , so agents know that fiscal policy
is passive and monetary policy is active, but they do not know the correct parameter
values.6 Given that agents think that monetary policy is governed by a policy rule with
6We make this assumption because it simplifies the exposition. This example shares many properties
of the first we will use for the DSGE model, but in that case initial beliefs of agents will be such that they

. Their conditional expectations of inflation next period are then given
by
E
t
t+1
= -

 - 
t
= -

 - 
(( - )t
+ t
) (10)
If we plug these expectations into the matrix equation above, we can see that, in this case,
there are two differences relative to rational expectations: first, the effect of a shock  on
expectations and thus contemporaneous inflation and debt can be different since now 
is in the denominator of the fraction in the equation determining expectations. Second,
there is an additional feedback effect governed by the differences between beliefs and actual
coefficients ( - )t
. At this point, it is instructive to mention how beliefs about fiscal
policy enter the equilibrium dynamics. Equation (7) uses the actual policy rules and
the government budget constraint to solve for debt dynamics. In the true government
budget constraint beliefs do not directly enter. Agents use a perceived version of the
budget constraint (equation (2), with the true parameter values replaced by the agents'
beliefs and the true policy shocks replaced by the perceived policy shocks)7 to forecast
equilibrium outcomes. The perceived fiscal shock will make their perceived government
budget constraint hold. As long as agents know that monetary policy is active and fiscal
policy is passive, beliefs about fiscal policy only enter equilibrium dynamics insofar as they
influence agents' estimates of fiscal policy shocks that make the perceived government
budget constraint hold. This is because, under the perception of active monetary policy
and passive fiscal policy, agents do not find fiscal shocks useful to forecast inflation, as
can be seen from equation (10).
2.2 The Dynamics Under a PLM When Agents Are Confused
About Which Policy is Active
Now let us assume that agents hold the same beliefs as before, but the ALM satisfies
 < 1 and -1 -  > 1. Plugging the expectations derived in the previous section into
the matrix equation that describes the endogenous dynamics of the system, we get

The key insight to take away here is that t
is still a stationary process (it is perfectly
correlated with the stationary shock t
). bt
, on the other hand, is now non-stationary
because inflation expectations and thus actual inflation do not move to offset the effects
of |-1 - | > 1 since inflation expectations are formed according to the dynamics for
believe that they live in an indeterminate equilibrium. To show how changes in beliefs alter equilibrium
dynamics in this analytical example, we do not need to incorporate indeterminacy.
7The perceived government budget constraint also includes perceived versions of 1
and 2
since those
are functions of the perceived monetary policy rule parameter - see the definition of the  parameters in
Leeper (1991).

the case in which monetary policy is active and fiscal policy is passive. To see this more
clearly, we can invert the matrix on the left-hand side of the equation above (call this
matrix A) and multiply by the matrix multiplying the lagged endogenous variables (call
this matrix B). This gives us the matrix governing the endogenous dynamics in the actual
law of motion. The inverse of A will also be lower triangular. To see this, we can apply
the formula for the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix to A. Doing so gives us the result that the
(2, 2) element of A-1 is 1 and the (1, 2) element is 0. Thus, we get
A-1B =
0 0
-2
-1 - 
(12)
The eigenvalues of that matrix are 0 and -1 - . The second eigenvalue is thus larger
than 1 in absolute value by our assumption. In general, we assume that   0, so the sec-
ond eigenvalue is bounded from above by 1

, which is around 1.01 with standard quarterly
calibrations of . This hints at the possibility that even if agents learn, in finite samples
debt can behave much like a random walk. We will see this in our learning economy.
This example, while abstracting from many important channels through which monetary
and fiscal policy can influence economic outcomes, already shows that beliefs of private
agents can have a large impact on economic outcomes and substantially alter the proper-
ties of the equilibrium. In particular, it will turn out that the random walk-like behavior
of debt coupled with stationary inflation dynamics will also be an outcome of our larger
model that we discuss next for the second policy experiment. Even though both Leeper's
model and our larger DSGE model that we turn to next abstract from issues such as the
zero-lower bound on nominal interest rates, the behavior of debt and inflation coming out
of both models when studying the second policy experiment resembles actual data for
developed economies since the global financial crises and the subsequent changes in fiscal
policies.
While Leeper's model is very useful for opening the hood and obtaining further insights
into the issues we want to study, it also has its limitations: An insight that we can only
infer from our benchmark economy (as we will see later) and not from Leeper's model
is that random walk-like behavior can also occur in the first scenario where agents know
that monetary policy is active and fiscal policy passive.8
Whenever eigenvalues of absolute value 1 or larger appear in arguments based on local
approximations (as is the case here and will be the case in our benchmark model) we know
that we can not use simulations to approximate unconditional moments. Nonetheless, for
simulations or calculations based on finite time periods such as those presented in this
paper, local approximation methods can be reliably used to approximate equilibrium dy-
namics when there are eigenvalues larger than 1 in play (especially when these eigenvalues
are not much larger than 1 in absolute value). This point has been made by Kim, Kim,
Schaumburg, and Sims (2003).9
8One can use other models that can be solved analytically to show that random walk-like behavior
can occur in the related case where fiscal policy is not explicitly modelled - see Cogley et al. (2015).
9The fact that the behavior of a very persistent, but stationary process is very similar to the behavior
of a unit root process in finite samples is at the heart of many issues connected with unit-root test, for
example.

3 Model
Our model is a standard a medium-scale New-Keynesian model along the lines of, for
example, Smets and Wouters (2007) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005).
It incorporates nominal frictions, habits, capital utilization and, additionally, a fiscal
sector. The government accumulates debt if its income from distortionary labor and
capital taxation does not match outlays for government spending, transfers, and debt
repayments and interest payments. First-order conditions and the complete log-linearized
model may be found in the Appendix. The calibration for all parameters is standard in
the literature and is mostly taken from Traum and Yang (2011), who estimate a similar
model using US data. We thus relegate the numerical values of the parameters to Table
7 in the Appendix.
3.1 Households
The economy is populated by a continuum of households which each have access to a
full set of state-contingent securities, which leads them to make the same investment and
consumption decisions, even though they each supply a different labor input to the labor
market. Households maximize their expected utility, 10 where the instantaneous utility
function of household j takes the following form:
Uj
t
= Ub
t
(Ct
- hCt-1

The household derives utility from consumption Ct
and disutility from hours worked L(j)t
.

Each period, households can choose either to consume, invest (It

common in the literature on adaptive learning. A more thorough description follows in the section where
the learning algorithm is described in more detail.

cation, this assumption allows us to keep the learning problem of the private agents more parsimonious.
The forces that drive our results would also be in play in a model with more than one tax rate.

The production function of firm i is linear in technology and labor:

denotes the output produced with a certain level of technology At

log(At

log(At-1

(25)
In terms of price setting, we assume that retailers set their prices according to the Calvo
(1983) mechanism, i.e. each period the fraction (1 - i
) of all firms are able to reset their
prices optimally. Furthermore, we assume that firms that cannot reoptimize their prices
in period t index their prices to the past inflation rate following the equation:

(30)
We let the labor tax rule react to past levels of debt. For simplicity, all other fiscal rules
follow Gaussian AR(1) processes. We assume that agents know all fiscal policy rules
10
except for the tax rule. Government spending is given by
log(Gt
) = ConstG
+ g
log(Gt-1
) + G
t
(31)
Zt
denotes transfers which behave as follows:
log(Zt
) = ConstZ
+ z
log(Zt-1
) + Z

, (32)
As mentioned above, the tax rate is modeled as a rule with the feedback coefficient b
,
which the agents do not know for sure and have to infer:
log(t
) = Const
+ b
log(Bt-1
) + 
t
(33)
Using the debt-to-GDP ratio as the right-hand side variable instead does not alter our
results. Monetary policy is conducted via a simple Taylor-type rule, which is only reacting
to lagged inflation.
log(Rt
) = ConstR
+ 
log(t-1
) + R
t
(34)
The firms and households in our model know the form of the labor tax rule and the
monetary policy rule as described above, but they do not know the coefficients, which
they have to estimate. They also know that the government budget constraint has to hold
in every period. We model the government and the central bank as reacting to lagged
endogenous variables so as to circumvent endogeneity issues in the learning problem of
private agents that would occur if the government and the central bank were to react
to contemporaneous endogenous variables. Given the information and implementation
lags present in economic policymaking, we do not think that this is an overly strong
assumption.
3.5 Market Clearing
Demand on the part of the government and households in the form of investment and
consumption in addition to the adjustment costs related to the utilization costs must fully
absorb the output of the firms:
Yt
= Ct
+ It
+ Gt
+ (Vt
)Kt-1
Market clearing in the bond market implies that all bonds issued by the government are
bought by the households in the economy.
4 Learning Mechanism
Our approach to modeling learning is borrowed from our earlier work Hollmayr and
Matthes (2013), which in turn builds on Cogley et al. (2015).
The private agents in our model observe all state variables in the economy and all
exogenous innovations except for the true policy shocks - instead of the true policy shocks
in the tax and monetary policy rules, they observe the perceived policy shocks, which are
the residuals in their corresponding estimated policy rules. They use those observations
to estimate the coefficients of the policy rules. Firms and households know all other
11
aspects of the model. All private agents share the same beliefs and carry out inference
by using the Kalman filter. The choice of the Kalman filter as the agents' estimation
procedure is motivated by the fact that we want to stay as close as possible to a (limited
information) rational expectations setup, and the Kalman filter returns the posterior
distribution for conditionally linear models with Gaussian innovations such as ours.13
The one departure from limited information rational expectations in our setup is the use
of the anticipated utility assumption (Kreps (1998)), which is common in the literature on
learning in macroeconomics (see, for example, Milani (2007)). This assumption amounts
to the private agents using a point estimate each period to form their beliefs (rather
than integrating over the posterior) and not contemplating future changes in beliefs when
making decisions.
We first describe the model that agents use to form estimates of policy rule coefficients.
Then, we will describe what those estimates imply for the agents' view about the dynamics
of the economy - we derive their perceived law of motion (PLM). Finally, we ask what
those perceptions imply for actual equilibrium dynamics - we derive the actual law of
motion (ALM) for the model.
We denote by t
the vector of policy rule coefficients 
and b
that agents want to
estimate. In order for agents to be able to use the Kalman Filter for inference, we need to
build a state-space system that encompasses our assumptions about the learning behavior
of agents. The observation equation is obtained by stacking the monetary policy rule
and the fiscal policy rule for taxes, whereas the state equation represents the perceived
dynamics in policy rule coefficients.
The vector of observables t
is given by 14
t
=
log(Rt
) - Rc
log(t
) - c
(35)
The observation equation is then:
t
= Xt-1
t
+ t
(36)
where t
collects the iid disturbances in the policy rules. Xt-1
collects the right-hand side
variables in the two policy rules, lagged inflation and lagged debt respectively. What is
left to specify then is the perceived law of motion for t
- how do firms and households in
the economy think policy rule coefficients change over time? We study two assumptions:
agents either know when the policy rule changes and take into account that policy rule
coefficients before and after the break date are fixed, or they suspect that policy changes
every period. The following law of motion for the coefficients encodes these assumptions,
inspired by the literature on time-varying coefficient models in empirical macroeconomics
13For a comparison of learning based on the Kalman Filter and learning based on recursive least squares
algorithms that are also common in the literature, see Sargent and Williams (2005).
14For simplicity, we assume that the steady states are known to the private agents (Cogley et al. (2015)
highlight the fact that the differences between dynamics under learning and the full information case
emerge mainly from different views held by agents on policy rule response coefficients, not intercepts).
Given their knowledge of the steady state and last period's estimates for the policy rule coefficients,
agents can back out an estimate of the intercepts in the policy rule, which they use in their state space
system. Those estimates are denoted below with a hat.
12
(such as Cogley and Sargent (2005) or Primiceri (2005)) 15:
t
= t-1
+ 1t
t
(37)
If we set the variance of t
to a conformable matrix of zeroes, then the private agents in
our model believe that policy rule coefficients do not change and they estimate unknown
constant coefficients. The indicator function 1t
selects in what periods agents perceive
there to be a change in policy. We will assume that this indicator function is 0 unless the
policy rule actually changes.
Given beliefs for t
, agents in our model will adhere to the anticipated utility theory of
decision-making: they will act as if t
is going to be fixed at the currently estimated
level forever onwards. This is a common assumption in the literature on learning, see for
example Milani (2007). We use the posterior mean forecast Et-1
(t
) = t|t-1
calculated
via the Kalman Filter as a point estimate which the agents in the model condition on
when forming expectations. By the random walk assumption on the parameters that
agents use in the Kalman filter, this also implies that t|t-1
= Et-1
(t-1
).
If we denote the vector of all variables (plus a constant intercept) in the model economy
by Yt
, then we can stack the log-linearized equilibrium conditions (approximated around
the steady state, which we assume is known to agents) and the estimated policy rules to
get the log-linearized perceived law of motion in the economy:
A(t|t-1
)Yt
= B(t|t-1
)E
t
Yt+1
+ C(t|t-1
)Yt-1
+ D
t
(38)

t
contains the standardized (i.e. variance 1) actual shocks that agents observe as well
as the standardized perceived policy shocks (the residuals in the estimated policy rules).
Those residuals are standardized because we choose to include the standard deviations
of the shocks in the system matrices. Because we use the anticipated utility assumption,
agents act as if their beliefs will not change in the future and this system can be solved
using a number of standard algorithms for the solution of linearized rational expectations
models such as Gensys (Sims (1994)).16 The resulting reduced form perceived law of
motion is given by
Yt
= S(t|t-1
)Yt-1
+ G(t|t-1
)
t
(39)
S(t|t-1
) solves the following matrix quadratic equation17:
S(t|t-1
) = (A(t|t-1
) - B(t|t-1
)S(t|t-1
))-1C(t|t-1
) (40)
and G(t|t-1
) is given by
G(t|t-1
) = (A(t|t-1
))-1D (41)
To derive the ALM, we replace the perceived policy rule coefficients in C(t|t-1
) with
15This assumption has been applied in the learning literature by Sargent et al. (2006), for example.
16If the estimated policy rule coefficients imply an indeterminate equilibrium, we use the equilibrium
returned by Gensys.
17The perceived law of motion can be derived by assuming a VAR perceived law of motion of order 1
and then using the method of undetermined coefficients.

To solve the model, we can plug the PLM into the ALM twice to get

)2Yt-1
+ S(t|t-1
)G(t|t-1
)

) + Cactual

(43)
Note that there are two types of shocks appearing in the last equation: the true and
the perceived shocks. We can solve for the dynamics of Yt
by only inverting A(t|t-1
)
as long as we can derive an expression for the perceived shocks that only depends on
pre-determined and exogenous variables. Fortunately enough, this is true in our case:

t
= t
+ IP(Cactual
(t|t-1
) - C(t|t-1
))Yt-1
(44)
where IP denotes a selection matrix that selects those rows of the vector it multiplies which
are associated with the policy instruments about whose dynamics the agents are learning
and rescales those rows by the inverse of the standard deviation of the corresponding
policy shock.
Plugging that expression into equation (43) we can derive the reduced form actual law of
motion:
Yt
= F(t|t-1
)Yt-1
+ R(t|t-1
)
t
(45)

R(t|t-1
) = A-1
(t|t-1
)(B(t|t-1
)F(t|t-1
))G(t|t-1
) + D (47)
This derivation departs from the derivation used in Cogley et al. (2015) because we found
our approach of solving for the equilibrium dynamics to be more numerically stable (once
we have solved for the ALM, our approach only requires invertibility of A(t|t-1
)).
5 Equilibrium Outcomes Under Learning
We now turn to simulating our learning economy. We consider the following two scenarios
described: First, we consider a scenario where we leave fiscal policy constant at all times.
It is passive in the sense that it stabilizes debt. Monetary policy is assumed to switch
from passive to active: 
changes from 0.8 to 1.5. This scenario is introduced to broadly
mimic the disinflation period during Paul Volcker's chairmanship of the Federal Reserve
in the early 1980s in the US.
We then consider a second scenario in which monetary policy becomes passive and distor-
tionary taxes react less to the level of debt. In particular, we consider a one-time switch
in the policy rule coefficients 
and b
from 1.5 and .1 to .8 and .04. Put differently,
the economy undergoes a switch from monetary dominance to fiscal dominance. This sce-
nario is meant to approximate the situation in many developed countries after the recent
financial crisis. The numerical values for the policy rule parameters pre- and post-policy
14
change for both scenarios are in line with parameter estimates for the US economy (Traum
and Yang (2011)).
We run 500 simulations of 100 periods with the policy switch occurring in period 10. 18
To keep the number of additional parameters manageable and to keep those parameters
interpretable, we assume agents use a covariance matrix of the innovations in the perceived
policy rule coefficients of the following form19:
E(t
t
) =
(scale  (1.5 - 0.8))2 0
0 (scale  (0.1 - 0.04))2
(48)
For simplicity, we will use the same calibration for both scenarios. The initial values
of the parameters are given by the pre-policy change true values - we can think of this as
the agents initially living in a world where any learning process has converged. For scale,
we use 1 as a benchmark value, but we also show selected results for 2 and 4. Agents
thus experience a shock that is either a 1 standard deviation shock, a shock of size half a
standard deviation, or a one-fourth standard deviation shock.
6 Results
6.1 A Switch From Passive to Active Monetary Policy - Revis-
iting Volcker
Figure 1 shows the probability that the perceived equilibrium of the private agents is
determinate. The black line gives the actual equilibrium behavior and the colored lines
gives the probabilities for the different sizes of perceived policy changes. We see that,
depending on the prior of the size of the policy change, initially the probability that
agents know that the policy rules actually imply a unique equilibrium after the policy
change is only between 20% and 50%. Furthermore, learning about the nature of the
equilibrium is slow. Before we turn to figuring out why this is, we want to point out that
agents in our simulations for this scenario never think that they are in a situation in which
the equilibrium is unstable - therefore the complement of the probability plotted in figure 1
is indeed the probability that the agents think the equilibrium is still indeterminate. Does
the fact that agents never think that the equilibrium is unstable imply that the actual
equilibrium dynamics are stable? Figure 2 answers this. It plots for each simulation the
largest eigenvalue in absolute value of F(t
) encountered in that simulation versus the
number of periods for which an eigenvalue of that matrix is larger than 1 in absolute
value. First, we see that large eigenvalues are pervasive in this scenario. All simulations
have at least one period with eigenvalues larger than 1. Second, the eigenvalues, while
larger than 1, are not substantially larger than 1, so the economy does not explode within
a few periods. Rather, eigenvalues of this magnitude imply random walk-like behavior.
Third, there are many simulations that feature large eigenvalues for substantial periods
18We choose not to put the policy switch at the beginning of the simulations in order to minimize the
effect of the choice of the initial covariance matrix for the Kalman Filter.
19We have used covariance matrices of this form in our previous work and found them useful for
interpreting the perceived amount of time variation.
15
of time - the probability of random walk-like behavior is substantial. And finally, there
is a negative relationship between the size of the largest eigenvalue during a simulation
and the number of periods for which the simulation feature random walk-like behavior.
This last feature can be explained by simple econometrics: the larger the eigenvalue is,
the more volatile the economy tends to be. If there is more volatility, then the agents can
more easily identify the post-policy change parameters since the right-hand side variables
in their models become more volatile. But how can it be that the economy features
random walk-like behavior when the perceived law of motion is stable? The logic behind
this result is given in Cogley et al. (2015). (This paper does not focus on the size of the
eigenvalues, however, and instead focuses on solving for an optimal monetary policy rule.)
The logic can also be seen by revisiting the equation determining F(t|t-1
):
F(t|t-1
) = A-1
(t|t-1
)(C(t|t-1
) + B(t|t-1
)F2
(t|t-1
))
+ A-1
(t|t-1
)(B(t|t-1
)F(t|t-1
)G(t|t-1
)IP(Cactual
(t|t-1
) - C(t|t-1
)))
The first term on the right-hand side gives the equilibrium dynamics under the perceived
law of motion, which are always stable in this scenario. However, the second term on the
right-hand side features the difference between actual and perceived laws of motion. If
that difference is large enough, the eigenvalues of the entire matrix can become larger than
1 in absolute value, even though the perceived law of motion is stable. In the standard
approach to modeling policy changes, we do not see random walk-like behavior - the
economy switches from one stable equilibrium to another. To see what impact this has
on equilibrium outcomes, figure 3 plots the difference between the outcomes under the
standard approach and the learning approach. To obtain these results, we use the same
shock series for both approaches, calculate the levels of the relevant variables and derive
the ratio of the median under one approach to the median under the other approach,
normalized by the steady state. For any variable at time j, we thus plot
DiffW
j
=
(Wlearning
j
- Wstandard
j
)
W
(49)
where Wlearning
j
is the median outcome in levels under learning and Wstandard
j
the cor-
responding outcome for the standard approach. To make the differences in GDP more
visible, we plot cumulative differences for GDP instead:
DiffW
j
=
j
t=1
(Wlearning
t
- WRE
t
)
W
(50)
We also plot the average parameter estimates.
We can see that sizeable differences arise for GDP, where the differences are most
visible. Agents learn about the monetary policy coefficient slowly - inflation is not volatile
enough to make them learn faster. Nonetheless, differences are -maybe surprisingly- small.
Even under rational expectations, our model features substantial persistence in many
variables, so the emergence of random walk-like behavior does not lead to vastly different
outcomes.20 This does not mean that our findings are not important for outcomes - we

Figure 3: Summary of outcomes for the `Volcker' experiment
will see larger differences in our second experiment that is motivated by recent economic
events. Also, even though we do not explicitly model credible policy communication in
this paper, our findings highlight that policy communication could be useful if it speeds
up learning of the agents.
6.2 The Dawn of Active Fiscal Policy
For our second experiment, the analytical results from Leeper's model already hint at
the strong possibility of random walk-like behavior when fiscal policy becomes active,
but private agents have incomplete knowledge of this. Note that, even if agents learn
quickly about changes in the fiscal policy rule, they can be misled if learning about the
monetary policy coefficient is slow. This is exactly what happens in our second scenario.
Figure 4 plots the probability of a stable perceived equilibrium. While, under rational
expectations, agents would know that the equilibrium is always stable, here agents are
indeed misled and believe they are in an unstable equilibrium. In contrast to the first
example, here even the perceived law of motion is unstable. This was not the case in our
analysis of Leeper's model, where we assumed a stable PLM for simplicity. An unstable
PLM can lead to instability in the ALM because of the first term on the right-hand side
in the equation for F(t|t-1
). The instability of the PLM creeps into the ALM in our
case, as can be seen by figure 5, which plots the largest eigenvalue in absolute value in
the ALM versus the number of periods for which an eigenvalue larger than 1 in absolute
value is present in the equilibrium dynamics. Are all variables affected by this random
walk-like behavior? Figure 6 shows some randomly selected sample paths from our sim-
ulation for inflation and debt. In spite of the difference in the nature of the PLM, we see
the same results as for Leeper's model: inflation is low and stable, whereas debt is very
persistent and displays random walk-like behavior. It is the stable behavior of inflation
that makes learning about the monetary policy coefficient hard, as can be seen by the
average estimate in figure 7. While debt is volatile enough in our economy so that the
average coefficient for the fiscal policy rule is learned almost immediately, 21 it takes a
of brevity) under the two approaches - they are not very different from each other for this scenario.
21Not all simulations feature fiscal policy coefficient that directly collapse to the true value, but they
all move in the right direction and the variation is quite small, so focusing on the average estimate across

Figure 4: Perceived equilibria in the second experiment
long time to learn about the change in monetary policy. In many simulations, agents thus
think that both monetary and fiscal policy are active, leading them to believe that the
equilibrium is unstable. In this scenario, we see larger differences in (cumulated) GDP
and debt between the learning economy and the standard approach to modeling policy
changes.
Even though our model abstracts from many issues that are important in the current
economic situation, this experiment still reproduces the broad patterns of low and stable
inflation and substantial persistent movements in debt. If we were to model a fiscal stim-
ulus along the lines of Drautzburg and Uhlig (2011), Cogan, Cwik, Taylor, and Wieland
(2010) or Hollmayr and Matthes (2013), we would see a larger initial jump in debt. The
learning problem that agents face in this scenario is hard because inflation does not move
enough to identify the changes in monetary policy. Incorporating the zero-lower bound
on nominal interest rates would only make this identification issue harder. The issues we
highlight here therefore seem very much relevant for the current economic environment.
To check whether or not our results hinge on the specific signal-to-noise structure
inherent in our calibration, we next turn to a calibration where we set the standard
deviation of the monetary policy error R
t
to half of the value in our benchmark calibration.
This will increase the information value of observations. Nonetheless, as can be seen in
figure 9, the nature of perceived equilibria is basically unchanged. Agents learn somewhat
faster that the true equilibrium is stable, but the difference from the standard calibration
is not large. These similarities carry over to other equilibrium outcomes, which we omit
here for the sake of brevity. Thus, even with a substantially smaller noise term in the
policy rule, we still get the same results - inflation in this experiment just does not vary
enough to make agents update their beliefs faster.22
simulations is not misleading.
22In the appendix we show that only once we almost let the noise term vanish we do get much faster
learning. In that case the standard deviation of the noise term in the monetary policy equation is 1/20th
of our benchmark number. Even with such a small noise term learning is not immediate, though.

7 Conclusion
This paper analyzes different modeling strategies for the analysis of discrete changes in
economic policy. We show that removing immediate knowledge of post-policy change
policy rules from agents can alter the nature of the perceived equilibrium. We show that
persistent, random walk-like behavior naturally occurs when agents have to learn about
policy changes and that the resulting equilibrium dynamics can make learning the true
policy rule coefficients difficult. It is important to remember that the agents in our models
are sophisticated econometricians - the properties of observed data in equilibrium make
learning hard, not the use of unsophisticated econometric techniques.
