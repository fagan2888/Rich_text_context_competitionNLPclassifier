`The Pope's own hand
outstretched': Holy See
diplomacy as a hybrid mode
of diplomatic agency
Jodok Troy1
Abstract
The unconventional nature of Holy See diplomats rests in the composite character of their
ecclesiastical role as the Pope's representatives and their legal diplomatic status and commencement
to ordinary diplomatic practice. Holy See diplomacy is a form of conduct created by a set of mixed
secular and religious standards in which agents are guided by practices. I locate this argument
within a classical English School and a conventional understanding of practice, diplomacy, and
agency while incorporating understandings of the diplomat as a stranger. The article situates a
Holy See diplomat's mode of agency as a hybrid one by nature, located at the intersections of
political and religious modes of agency and substantial and relational conceptions of international
politics. I probe this conceptual framework of hybrid agency by analysing episodes involving papal
diplomats in turmoil-ridden historical episodes, and correspondence with informed agents.

Pope John XXIII (1966: 106) referred to the role of the nuncio (the papal ambassador) as
`The Pope's own hand outstretched'to the world of states. Popes before him made similar
statements, and the ones after him keep echoing variations of it. The acclamation for the
expansion of diplomatic missions, for instance, is a common pattern of the pope's annual
addresses to the diplomatic corps accredited at the Holy See (`HS'). Although the papacy
is one of the oldest participants in the international society of states, its diplomatic engage-
ment may perplex, as international society is assumed to be a secular compound. Still, the
trajectory of the papacy's diplomatic entanglement in international society has been con-
stitutive in forming the diplomatic system. Scholars of diplomatic history and diplomatic

practitioners have long since acknowledged this relevance of the papacy (Barker, 2006:
32; Der Derian, 1987b; Kerr and Wiseman, 2013: 25, 55; Nicolson, 1977; Plöger, 2005;
Rennie, 2013; Roberts and Satow, 2011). Recently, this relevancy has been illustrated yet
again by a cable from the American embassy to the HS to Washington after the election
of Pope Francis:
despite the disparity in size, governance, and history, we are both global powers, with global
interests and influence. From many points of view, the HS is unique to the world in its ability to
pursue its own agenda. The Vatican, with its diplomatic relations [...] is second only to the
United States. (Mastrolilli, 2017)
Diplomats are aware of the scope and influence of the HS diplomatic trajectory, but
International Relations tend to set aside the HS diplomatic trajectory and its societal prac-
tices as historical footnotes or proxy variables.
By placing the diplomatic entanglement of the HS in international politics to the his-
torical backburner, international studies disdain insights with grave consequences.
Today, the Church's members and officials are increasingly from all over the world and
inter-religious dialogue, for example, becomes important as part of the engagement in
political and social policy issues under the aegis of diplomacy. Diplomacy itself is a key
part of this transformation which offers expanded space for actors engaging in diplo-
macy (Constantinou et al., 2016). HS diplomacy transfers its religious and political posi-
tions well beyond its religious constituency, which is a common feature of the global
outreach of religious institutions (Marshall, 2013). Yet unlike other organised religions,
the HS global outreach is highly institutionalised, rests on formal diplomatic representa-
tions around the globe equal to embassies and acknowledged by international law. This
entanglement between the HS and the international sphere of states generates the strange
case of agents that are simultaneously clergy and mirror their secular counterparts. Their
very existence and practice are an example of how religious and political entanglements
in the international realm `generate creative, dynamic, and hybrid modes of social and
political agency' (Agensky, 2017: 21; see also, May et al., 2014; Sheikh, 2012; Thomas,
2000; Wilson, 2014).
Whereas ordinary diplomats are serving the goals of a territorial unit, the unconven-
tional nature of HS diplomats is nested in the hybrid character of their ecclesiastical role
as the Pope's representatives and their legal diplomatic status and commencement to
ordinary diplomatic practice. Their papal patron's global perspective renders them unusu-
ally dedicated to influencing the conditions beyond their principal's immediate posses-
sions (such as a territory). This standing places them at an advantage in an international
society in which such contextual factors are centrally important. This advantage is rein-
forced by the degrees to which HS diplomats constitute a combination of transnational
identity and national interest. This difference is obvious when looking at instances of how
papal diplomats mediate between a conventional approach and the approach of the HS.
Between `its supernatural mission of salvation and the mundane reality of world politics',
the institution of the papacy `remains a singular and surprisingly vital factor in the inter-
national scene' (Conway, 1979: 474). The agents of papal diplomacy are thus a puzzling
case of how to merge the aspirations and expectations of a religious principal with a
conventional approach of diplomatic practice.
Given the religious nature of its principal, its ordained agents, and international socie-
ty's requirements for diplomatic standards and practice, papal diplomacy cannot be like
ordinary diplomacy. Papal diplomacy is the result of a religious and political entanglement
Troy 523
that generates a hybrid mode of agency of which this article proposes the constituents of
its diplomatic practice. This argument is located within a classical English School under-
standing of practice, diplomacy, and agency while incorporating constructivist understand-
ings of the diplomat as a stranger. The article situates HS diplomat's mode of agency as
hybrid, located at the intersections of political and religious modes of agency and substan-
tial and relational conceptions of international politics, an angle that has not been applied
to HS diplomacy by scholars of International Relations and diplomacy.
After a review of the literature on the HS in international society, the next section
illustrates the hybrid mode of diplomatic agency. This hybrid diplomatic agency resolves
questions at the intersection of substantialist and relational conceptions of international
relations and political and religious modes of agency. HS diplomats act on behalf of a
religious and a political entity and logic in religious and secular environments. The next
step unpacks the historical trajectory of the HS diplomatic practice. The article draws on
a hybrid mode of agency by illustrating how the different dimensions and conceptions
matter in blueprinting a comprehensive picture of HS diplomacy. The remainder of the
paper demonstrates how the hybrid mode of agency varies by degree. The framework of
hybrid agency is then probed by analysing incidents involving papal diplomats in tur-
moil-ridden historical episodes and unstructured interviews and correspondence with
informed agents. This section teases out points of broader interest and illustrates the com-
plex entanglement of the religious and political. The conclusion locates the findings in the
context of the theoretical framework, the general political interest in the Church, its
entanglement in international society, and points out future avenues of research.
Holy See diplomacy: Hybrid by nature
Notwithstanding recent studies on diplomacy and practice, the claim of diplomacy's resist-
ance to theorising still resonates in the literature (Jönsson and Hall, 2005; Neumann, 2003).
This resistance is even more so when International Relations theory is confronted with the
agents of a religious transnational actor. There is a solid body of literature that situates the
HS and the Catholic Church in an international context (Abdullah, 1996; Barbato, 2013;
Cardinale, 1976; Graham, 1959; Hanson, 1987; Kurth, 1993; Martens, 2006; Murphy,
1974; Rotte, 2007). This literature focuses variously on soft power (Byrnes, 2017;
Sommeregger, 2011; Troy, 2010), international organisations (Abdullah, 1996; Araujo and
Lucal, 2004a, 2004b, 2010; Chong and Troy, 2011; Leustean, 2013; Neale, 1998), bilateral
relations,1 international law (Casaroli, 1981; Morss, 2016), the HS and the church as trans-
national actors (Barbato, 2013; Ryall, 2001; Vallier, 1971) and their mobilising power
(Barbato, 2016; Turina, 2015), the Pope as chief diplomat and moral authority (Hall,
1997), or theological explanations of political outcomes where the Church has been
involved in peacebuilding efforts (Cortright, 2008: 200­203; Riccards, 1998).
Most of this literature describes the HS diplomatic structure and community. But the
studies that provide insights into the practices of the HS diplomatic service are case stud-
ies in which members of the diplomatic service or special envoys achieved a conflict
settlement (Laudy, 2000; Princen, 1987, 1992; Schelkens, 2011). Questions about power,
statecraft, and how to put the HS diplomatic apparatus in the context of International
Relations theory are largely absent in the literature, nor are there any comprehensive
conceptual outlines of its diplomatic agential practices. The few exceptions that do so
focus on the actorness of the HS as a principal actor, rather than on its agents (Barbato,
2013; McLarren and Stahl, 2015; Neumann, 2011).
524 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(3)
Given the formalised and institutional setting of HS diplomacy, this section sets out a
conventional conceptualization of its diplomatic apparatus and practice. Like other actors
that practice ordinary diplomacy, the HS diplomatic practice follows international for-
malised and recognised rules. The rather conservative education and public restraint of its
members resemble what is usually termed as `high politics', in the sense that it is a realm
of senior statesmen. For the sake of foreign policy assets, agents were supposed to prac-
tice diplomacy as an art. Certainly, the ideal type of diplomacy Realists had in mind was
already in their own time more of a nostalgic sentiment than a realistic option (Bessner
and Guilhot, 2015). Yet in the case of the HS diplomatic service, this understanding of
diplomacy as an asset still applies, as its diplomats face less constraint by democratic
processes and public opinion than their secular peers (Morgenthau, 1978: 525­531). In
sum, a conventional conceptualization is warranted by the fact that the HS perceives its
diplomatic service in realistic terms as an asset for its foreign policy (Cahill, 2017).
However, given the puzzle outlined in the introduction, a conventional notion of HS
diplomacy needs a contextualization of diplomacy as the practice of religious agency if it
is to be understood as a hybrid mode of agency. This context requires moving beyond
`explaining' practices by `naming' them (Sending et al., 2015: 9) or describing rules and
institutions. Rather, a hybrid mode of agency needs to differentiate why agents do what
they do, based on their self-understanding as ordinary and ordained diplomats and how
the two modes merge. Focusing on the institutional setting and agency of the HS diplo-
matic service as a practice involves an approach `in which action reflects the ideas, cul-
tural contexts, identities, and shared understandings of individual and state actors'(Green,
2014: 1). Such an approach focuses on agency, ideal types, self-justifications and dis-
courses by interrogating practices in order to discern their normative content (Navari,
2009: 3).2 Rather than a form of behaviour or an individual habit, here diplomacy is
understood as a form of conduct created by a set of societal standards in which agents are
guided by practices (Navari, 2011: 626­627). Practices are `bundles of rituals, words and
even physical placements, to which autonomous individuals look as guides for appropri-
ate social behaviour' (Navari, 2011: 613). HS diplomacy, then, is a form of conduct cre-
ated by a set of mixed secular and religious standards in which its agents are guided by
practices, rather than caused by them.
Studying the `diplomatic community itself' (Wight, 1966: 22) and the practice of the
`pope's men', rather than `the'pope or `the'HS, reveals supplementary insights to studies
focusing on the actorness of the HS or studying `the' diplomacy of this actor. The advan-
tage of this approach is researching diplomacy not only as a category of analysis, but also
as one of explanation of what `the pope's men' are doing. The title `nuncio', for instance,
is one who announces the will of the pope but in practice he does much more. In broader
terms, conceptualising HS diplomacy as a hybrid mode of agency comprises four dimen-
sions based on the religious and political modes of agency and substantialist and rela-
tional conceptualizations of international politics (see Figure 1). HS diplomacy cumulates
at the intersection of all four dimensions. It is neither only about ordinary diplomats rep-
resenting and communicating the HS interests or mediating difference between political
principals, nor are its agents simply members of clergy and religious individuals who
participate in faith-based diplomacy (Johnston, 2003; Troy, 2008).
This conceptualization of HS diplomacy as a hybrid mode of agency builds on
Agensky's (2017: 21) instruction that religious and political entanglements `generate
creative, dynamic, and hybrid modes of social and political agency'. Ignoring `the rela-
tional dimensions of religion and international politics encourages neglect of key
Troy 525
moments in the production of religious and political identities and practices, as well as
the implicit normative position taken by doing so'(Agensky, 2017: 3­4; see also Wilson,
2010). International Relations theories often rest on substantialist conceptions of politics
that build on autonomous acting subjects. As such, they frame diplomacy as an instru-
ment of foreign policy and focus on representing and communicating the principal's
interests.3 Hence, they set aside what logic the subjects follow (Jönsson and Hall, 2005:
14),4 let alone on what identities and practices those logics rest. A turn to the English
School notion of practice does not suggest a complete shift of the analytical focus to a
relational conception. Doing so rather adds a complementary approach since any institu-
tionalisation at the `cognitive level entails the development of a common language and
intersubjective structures of meaning and interpretation of words, actions and symbols'
(Jönsson and Hall, 2005: 40).
In other words, an analysis of diplomacy needs to turn to the question of how `what
one knows in diplomacy and what one makes of that knowledge depends on what one
understands diplomacy to be ­ and vice versa' (Constantinou, 2013: 142; originally in
emphasis). This question is important in addressing diplomacy, particularly its agents'
problems of living estrangement between them and the host society if international poli-
tics is to be understood from a relational angle. The task of diplomats is to act in and re-
act to the macro and micro surroundings, other than the well-known ones of their own
(national) community. Diplomacy is thus also about `how we can live together in differ-
ence' (Constantinou, 2013: 142; originally in emphasis). Diplomats epitomise the human
desire to live separately and to maintain relations with others. Being a stranger and living
estrangement are thus inherent parts of being a diplomat (Der Derian, 1987a, 1987b;
Sending, 2011; Sofer, 1997). This status fulfils social and political functions such as pro-
viding the necessary distance for negotiations in a substantialist conception, which takes
diplomacy merely as a functional asset of foreign policy.
This substantialist conception is a permeating condition for HS diplomats, yet in their
case diplomacy becomes a hazardous endeavour. They do not only represent the HS but
also the Catholic part of the host state's society qua their institutionalised religious affili-
ation (Cardinale, 1976). Hence they cannot, by definition, remain strangers in their host
Figure 1. Hybrid mode of Holy See diplomacy

states. Whereas HS diplomats are part (at least the Catholic part) of the host society,
`secular' diplomats largely remain strangers.5 What is more, HS diplomats are `foreign
nationals' representing the interests of a political entity which is not their own from the
perspective of inter-state relations. Conventional substantial approaches of diplomacy
defect this intersubjective impetus of how people can live together in difference. Instead,
they focus on diplomacy as a dependent variable, referring to the macro social structure
(see for example Kissinger, 1995, 2014) or the micro structure in formal terms (Gould-
Davies, 2013; Neumann, 2002; Pouliot and Cornut, 2015). However, diplomacy is always
an intersubjective enterprise in which `[d]ifferent people with different social traits, will
report different things' (Neumann, 2010). Not only do they report different things, but
they do things differently.
Contextualising the Holy See diplomatic trajectory
There are at least three challenges that any investigation of the HS diplomatic service and
its practices faces. First, there is a lack of data on diplomatic and political micro
practices.6 As large as the diplomatic apparatus of the HS is, it is the Pope on whose per-
son the public and academic focus rests.7 This section tackles this problem by turning to
unstructured interviews and correspondence with nuncios, informed agents, and an exam-
ination of historical episodes involving three prominent nuncios in the 20th and 21st
century. Second, the HS dedicates a great deal of resources to internal matters of faith. An
analysis of diplomatic practice thus cannot put aside theological explanations in the
course of analysing different self-understandings. Third, diplomatic achievements and
failures are hard to evaluate, as they are conducted behind closed doors and tend to remain
secretive.8
It is thus inevitable that any study, other than a single case study, remains in large por-
tions abstract and eventually must point out the necessity of further field studies. In its
first part, this section builds on the legal and historical trajectory of the HS diplomatic
practice. Based on such a conventional account of HS diplomatic practice, the second part
weaves together the education of HS diplomats and conceptualizations of their practice in
compliance with the tasks of ordinary diplomats. From a perspective of substantive con-
ceptions of agent's missions and under the lens of a political mode of agency, HS diplo-
mats appear like other diplomats. However, the remainder of the section illustrates that
how diplomatic tasks are accomplished depends on how diplomats act on the ground
based on intersubjective practices and standards of excellence within their communities.
Those practices and standards of excellence render them not only under a political but
also religious mode of agency.
HS diplomats are engaged in traditional secular diplomacy such as the aspiration of
good relations between the HS and the host nation. In doing so, diplomats represent the
pope as the head of the Catholic Church and not as the head of the Vatican.9 The legal
embodiment of the Church is the HS (the papacy) which is an international personality in
international law. In terms of international law, the `State of the Vatican City' and the HS
are different entities. They are linked by the personal-union with the pope, the supreme
head of the Catholic Church and the Vatican City. The foreign relations of Vatican City
are managed by the HS, which is subject to international law. In operational terms, the
management comprises the HS Secretary of State and its subordinate, the Secretary of
Relations with States.10 In 2017, Pope Francis created a third section, the Secretary of
States (`Section for the Holy See diplomatic staff'), which is exclusively dedicated to the
Troy 527
work of the nuncios (Agasso, 2017). Its installation is yet another indicator of the continu-
ing importance the Church attributes to its diplomatic engagement.
Ever since the development of the modern international system, its entities needed a
way to communicate in a structural establishment marked by the gap in the relationship
between and within political entities (Morgenthau, 1956: 30; Sharp, 2009: 293). It was
then that diplomacy became a formalised interaction between political entities. From its
beginning, the HS participated in this formalised interaction. This was not only because
(after the Lateran Treaties in 1929) the HS acquired a formal territory, but because it
pressed to preserve its normative influence in the international society.11 First attempts of
regulated and institutionalised diplomatic activities of the HS date back to the 15th cen-
tury when it became necessary to regulate rights and obligations between the Church and
various political entities. The institutionalisation of HS diplomatic practice was not the
result of one particular pope or period of history but evolved impulsively. In modern
times this impulsive character of the institutionalisation of HS diplomatic practice became
visible as the diplomatic apparatus drastically expanded during the regency of Pope John
Paul II (1978­2005).12 Today, the HS has diplomatic relations with almost all countries
around the globe and newly consolidated nations keep seeking recognition from the HS
(Sommeregger, 2011: 132­135; The Economist, 2007).13
The conduct of the diplomatic apparatus such as the maintenance of nunciatures is
regulated in the Code of Canon law.14 Nunciatures regularly report on matters of the
Catholic Church in host countries, and they seek unity between the HS and the local
Church. Since the Congress of Vienna the Doyen (the senior ambassador) of the diplo-
matic Corps has been recurrently the nuncio, at least in Roman Catholic countries.15 In
terms of international law, nunciatures hold the same status as embassies. Canon law
offers a range of functions for papal legates, most of them dealing with internal matters
of the Church such as assisting local bishops. These internal matters include traditional
clerical duties, such as the appointments of bishops, which influence domestic and inter-
national politics as the contested cases in the People's Republic of China illustrate (Wee,
2014). However, that clerical task routinely propels critics to point out that canon law
suggests that the nuncio is a papal watchdog to supervise the local Catholic Church (that
is, the dioceses).16
The HS diplomatic envoys and nunciatures had their high-days in the medieval ages
and early modern era. Later, the popes themselves took over the diplomatic agenda (Kent
and Pollard, 1994b), applying traditional, symbolic, legal, and representational instru-
ments of diplomacy in their every-day conduct. Scholars of diplomacy and International
Relations thus partly attribute the evolution of the diplomatic culture as we know it today
to Christendom, noting a Christian influence on the diplomatic culture up to the present
day (Meyer et al., 1997: 174; Neumann, 2012: 310).
Conventional education, conventional practice?
The Pontificia Accademia Ecclesiastica, founded by Pope Clemens XI in 1701 in Rome,
cultivates the religious influence on ordinary diplomacy. In modern times, it played an
important part in professionalising the diplomatic service of the HS, as it consolidated its
bureaucracy, particularly in the first half of the 20th century (Alvarez, 1989). The acad-
emy proved to be the prime educational site for future high ranking Church officials and
popes. Popes themselves influenced the Church's domestic and international reputation
within the academy. Pope John XXIII (1958­1963), himself not an alumnus of the
528 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(3)
academy but a respected diplomat, was a powerful influence, as were his successors Paul
VI (1963­1978) and John Paul II (1978­2005). The latter, due to his interest in foreign
policy, was a frequent guest at the academy. The task of the academy is to acquire and
educate young clerics from the `Roman-cultural' environment for future tasks in the sec-
retary of state or in nunciatures.17 Since the foundation of the academy its presidents were
largely Italians and its students largely from outside Europe (Kracht, 2011: 987­989).18
Not least due to its geographical location, for the most part the academy remains
Italian in character and with the exception of a few outsiders, the Secretaries of States, its
most prominent alumni, have been Italian (Kent and Pollard, 1994a: 12).19 At his first
address to the community of the academy, Pope Francis called for the education of future
papal representatives as priestly ministers, a task that demands `great inner freedom' and
the abandonment of `careerism'.20 Given its 300years history and influence on the educa-
tion of Church officials, the question of whether the Pontificia Accademia Ecclesiastica
aptly is an academy or a college remains an open one (Kracht, 2011: 989­990; Oliveri,
1982).21
The existence of HS diplomats over the course of centuries and their conventional train-
ing illustrates that the papacy is not unique compared to other diplomatic actors in the
international realm. It is yet another example of institutional accommodation and struc-
tural modernization of the diplomatic service, with the aim of establishing a traditional and
functional diplomatic apparatus (Alvarez, 1989: 248). In this regard, HS diplomacy is a
performance of a host of practices that follow the general practices of a diplomatic com-
munity (Sharp and Wiseman, 2007) such as maintaining permanent representatives in
states and international organisations. Those practices are patterned as they entail particu-
lar rules (for instance, the ones laid out in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations),
they are competent because diplomats are educated practitioners and the education is insti-
tutionalised, and they rely on institutionalised background knowledge. Accordingly, as
diplomats, the agents of the HS tend to be skillful in their practice.
The practice of HS diplomats also weaves together discursive and material worlds. Its
diplomats engage in a dialogue that weaves together claims of the Church's moral author-
ity with material worlds such as the vast bureaucratic infrastructure of the HS and its
nunciatures worldwide.22 They are essentially legally recognised agents in an interna-
tional society that grounds its dialogue in diplomacy (Watson, 1991). They are trained as
diplomats, they are experts in the tasks and missions assigned to them and based on their
religious affiliation they are nominally also moral experts. This phenomenon becomes
obvious in looking at how diplomats pursue and engage in different foreign policy goals.
Diplomats participate in shaping and acquiring possession and milieu goals of foreign
policy (Ryall, 1998; Wolfers, 1962: 67­80). Reflecting the actor's national interest, pos-
session goals aim at the enhancement or preservation of something the actor values.
Milieu goals, on the other side, aim to shape the conditions beyond the actor's immediate
possessions. Seen from the perspective of the HS, priority is assigned to milieu goals on
the grounds of its universal salvic mission. A marker of the emphasis on milieu goals is
the HS gaining of a seat as a permanent observer at the United Nations.
In line with his `bolder' vision of diplomacy (Povoledo, 2013; Yardley, 2014), Pope
Francis called for a more intense dialogue with Islam and a renewed diplomatic discourse
with states that have no official ties with the HS. The HS has no official diplomatic ties
with China or North Korea but in both cases, there are various movements on the side of
the HS, either to improve relations or to establish institutionalised relations.23 The engage-
ment in milieu goals illustrates the weight the Church places on the practice and
Troy 529
institution of diplomacy. To be sure, pursuing milieu goals is not always successful or
appreciated by other actors in the international society. The HS, for example, was blamed
for triggering the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s by prematurely recognising the inde-
pendence of Catholic states (Allen, 2014: 7, 152; Byrnes, 2001: Chapter 4; Grant, 1999:
178­179).
The participation of the HS in international organisations is not least due to increasing
pluralism in international politics, which calls for an institutionalisation of diplomacy
(Mayall, 2007: 2). Since the pope has no `divisions', as Josef Stalin once allegedly
remarked, establishing conventional formal relations with governments is one way to
maintain geopolitics based on the sheer numbers of humans involved (Agnew, 2010). In
this regard, the HS is a rare example24 of a non-state actor with diplomatic privileges,
recognised by the majority of states in the international realm, of which diplomacy is a
foundational and institutionalised pillar (Bull, 2002; Bull and Watson, 1984; Jönsson and
Hall, 2005; Wight, 1997). It is therefore no surprise that the HS supported the develop-
ment of modern international governmental organisations (Chong and Troy, 2011;
Leustean, 2013; Melnyk, 2009; Tomasi, 2017; Wuthe, 2002).25
As principal, the HS seeks to justify its engagement in shaping possession and milieu
goals on theological grounds, communicated by its agents which establish the hybrid
diplomatic agency. However, although there are policy guidelines for both goals, their
implementation process is far from being coherently implemented by the agents, which
illustrates the limits of a conventional notion of practice.
The Pope's eye, heart, and hand: Ordinary and ordained
HS Secretary of State Pietro Parolin characterises HS diplomacy as `human diplo-
macy' because `real people must be at the centre of all diplomatic action'.26 According
to Cardinal Sodano (2000: 91) (HS Secretary of State 1990­2006), the goal of papal
representation is `to bring the leaven of the Gospel to all the complex reality of inter-
national relations and to international debates'. The aims of HS diplomats are to serve
and represent the interests of the Church, to maintain or establish peace between
nations, and the empowerment of international and supranational structures (Sharp,
2009: 133­134). `Political support or material aid they will certainly not expect',
reads the statement by the HS mission to the United Nations on the purpose of its
agents. `What they do seek', instead, `is what the HS, by its very nature and tradition,
can offer: orientation and spiritual inspiration that should animate the life of nations
and their mutual relationships'.27 This spiritual duty is also reflected in the Church's
Canon law:
diplomatic relations of the pope are always carried on in light of [the] spiritual mission, hence
legates represent the Holy See [...]; civil governments enter into relations not with the State of
Vatican City but with the Holy See itself [and] the title given representatives of the Holy See
(`nuncios' rather than `ambassadors') is intended to underscore the particular nature of their
mission. (Coriden et al., 1985: 302)
The `Apostolic Nuncio is one of the most characteristic signs of the Pope's presence in
a nation', as Pope John XXIII, former nuncio to France, summarised it. Moreover, pon-
tifical `and national diplomacy have a common basis in frankness and in the constant
effort to improve relations. But they differ in their essential characteristics' (Pope John
530 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(3)
XXIII, 1966: 105). The nuncio is the pope's eye, heart and hand in the host state. What
Pope John XXIII stated for his position while nuncio in France can be read as the tasks of
an ideal-type nuncio:
An eye ever open to serene observation of the moral, religious and social state of France, in
order to render a true and objective account to the Supreme Pastor.Aheart watchful and sensitive
to the needs of the people of Christ, as hungry for spiritual foods as they are for bodily sustenance.
The Pope's own heart indeed, for his mission is not to busy himself with material conquests and
earthly interests, and not to follow in the ways of intrigue and hatred, but to observe the law of
brotherhood and love. Finally, a hand to point to the right road, a hand which, in the Lord's
name, succours, encourages and blesses. This is still and will always be the Pope's own hand
outstretched, reproduced in the person and office of his Nuncio, in France and in every other
nation. (Pope John XXIII, 1966: 106)
This instruction is similar to conceptualizations of ordinary diplomatic modes of
agency and conventional notions of practice, which is obvious in both the first and the last
sentence of the quote. It stresses the importance of the diplomat's task of gathering infor-
mation and communicating interests. It combines the view of diplomats as representing a
principal in behaviour (to act for others) and in status (to stand for others) (Jönsson and
Hall, 2005: 100). It illustrates the thin line between representation and governing (Mitzen,
2015) when it asserts that the nuncio should point `to the right road'. Finally, the instruc-
tion indicates that nuncios, like ordinary diplomats, also act on behalf of certain ideas and
not only on behalf of governments and principals. Peace has been seen as the most elusive
of human ideas, and is indeed an objective in this regard (Jönsson and Hall, 2005: 116;
Macomber, 1975: 25), no less so in HS diplomatic practice (Parolin, 2017: xv­xvi). The
objective of peace predates the objective of serving the principal (Sharp, 1997: 616) as an
asset that mediates between different entities.
This instruction is also an expression of the religious mode of diplomatic agency and as
such it is illustrative of the HS hybrid character with regard to diplomacy. Pope Francis,
addressing the diplomatic academy, reinforced the main elements of the religious mode of
agency in this instruction. In particular, he stressed the need for HS diplomats to keep their
spirituality amid their worldly tasks and pointed out that their future life will be inserted in
different societal contexts. He also pointed out that HS diplomats need to be examples in
their lives, characterised by closure, dialogue, listening but also tangible verbal action.
What is more, he stressed that HS diplomats need to serve the evangelization without pros-
elytising as the Church grows by attraction (Pope Francis, 2013; Radio Vatikan, 2017).
Hybrid modes of agency in practice
The remainder of this section turns to three cases of nuncios in turmoil ridden historical
episodes. The cases illustrate that although there are outlines of an ideal-type nuncio such
as illustrated above, their practical mode of agency remains a hybrid one as it comes into
existence through the interaction of different origins. Although any hybrid mode has its
own outstanding characteristics and remains hybrid in nature, it varies in degree. This
variance is no different in the case of HS diplomats. The three episodes of the nuncios
Joseph Hurley, Jose Laboa, and Fernando Filoni illustrate that the mix of principal steered
possession and milieu goals, diplomatic practice, and the self-understanding of the agents
add up to a contextualization of the HS diplomatic service and the practices of its mem-
bers as a hybrid mode of agency.
Troy 531
Joseph P. Hurley from the United States was perhaps one of the most influential yet
largely unknown papal diplomats in the 20th century. Hurley originally served in the
Japan mission in the 1930s and was a warning voice of National Socialism and Fascism.
He served again as nuncio in the 1940s in Yugoslavia and became known for his fierce
stand against Communism. Hurley is an outstanding example of a papal diplomat as he
resembles many of the aforementioned ideal type features of ordinary diplomats. He was
sympathetic towards an approach of diplomacy understood as `high politics' such as
secretively operating behind the scenes and keeping a low public profile. Yet he also
believed his role to be the `Pope's own hand outstretched'. Throughout his life, he was
torn between serving his two masters: the United States and the Church, and rival inter-
pretations over the mission of them (Gallagher, 2008: 1­3). In the early Cold War years,
he sided with the US State Department, with which he became disappointed in the 1950s
as he found no more `convergence between Catholic ideas and U.S. political realities'
(Gallagher, 2008: 196).
The episode of Hurley illustrates how difficult it is to grasp the practice of HS diplo-
mats along the religious model of diplomatic agency. During several stages of his career
Hurley, in many respects, might have come close to a conventional diplomat but he
remained so in ordinary diplomatic terms.Although he assumed his role as serving church
and country, he sometimes placed the mission of the latter over the former. Arguably, in
this regard Hurley was a classic example of a power politic driven agent, mediating
between different political entities. As Hurley tried to serve two principals, he encoun-
tered difficulties in doing justice to both as well as becoming even more disappointed
when the two principals parted ways in their goals in the 1950s. The story of Hurley
illustrates that HS diplomacy is not always conducted along standardised diplomatic
practices. In Hurley's case, this divergence meant that he drifted from representing to
governing, mediated by personal beliefs regarding the political and the religious realm.
Yet still, he complied with the art of diplomacy as a form of high politics and certainly
was seen as an outstanding diplomat.
Another episode illustrates how a papal agent got caught between the principal's for-
eign policy goals and ended up improvising. It is the episode of how Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega was eventually handed over into the hands of US authorities. In 1989,
rather unexpectedly, Jose Sebastian Laboa from Spain and nuncio to Panama was faced
with the difficulties that serving possession goals bring with them when Noriega took
refuge in the nunciature. Without being able to consult the HS at first, the nuncio extended
the diplomatic immunity to another house to separate Noriega from his aids. Eventually,
Laboa, who had been encouraging anti-Noriega forces before, was able to sway Noriega
out of the embassy and into the hands of US forces. He did so through a carefully orches-
trated psychological campaign, warning Noriega of the danger of being lynched or by
talking about loyalty at the Catholic Mass. All of this practice aimed to convince Noriega
that his only realist option was to give up (Kempe, 1990: 398­417; Parmelee, 1989;
Rooney, 2013: 169; Rosenthal, 1990; Rother, 1990). In his approach of doing so, Laboa
illustrated the behaviour of a classical rationalist driven agent of international society,
subtly complying with international law to achieve his goals. However, because Laboa
turned to the religious practice of the Catholic Mass attended by Noriega, as a means to
practice diplomacy, Laboa also relied on elements only an ordained diplomat can turn to
such as the Catholic liturgy.
The episodes of Hurley and Laboa illustrate that, on the surface, HS diplomats operate
like ordinary diplomats, face the same challenges, and rely on the same instruments.
532 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(3)
However, they also know how to use their authority as ordained diplomats. Without an
in-depth study into the agents motives, the episodes only hint towards a genuine hybrid
mode of agency. We can find this mode in operation in the more recent case of nuncio
Fernando Filoni, originally from Italy.
Recalling the mediation of difference and estrangement, Filoni's case illustrates how
HS diplomats are an inherent part of the host society, and not only the Catholic part of it.
Filoni was the representative of the Pope in Iraq in 2014 but first became famous for
remaining on his post as nuncio in Iraq during the 2003 US bombing of Bagdad (Allen,
2014; Filoni, 2009). Explaining his remaining on in the post, he argued that it `was noth-
ing exceptional. To live in Baghdad during the war was a decision in line with the mission
of a pontifical representative who ... by residing in the countries participates, or rather
inserts himself into their life. Our very situation in itself led us to share the destiny of the
Iraqi people with all their sufferings, injustices and hopes'.28 Filoni's actions constituted
a modality of practice and discourse of a Church of the margins as it is today attributed to
Pope Francis'conception of the Church (Ferrara, 2015; Ivereigh, 2015) and its diplomatic
service more broadly. In this regard, Filoni appears as an advocate of a cosmopolitan idea
of world society. While staying in the apostolic nunciature in 2003 and justifying his stay,
he weaved together claims of religious agency and political agency based on material
worlds such as diplomatic representation. The episode of Filoni illustrates what an ideal-
type of a hybrid agent of papal diplomacy could look like. It emphasises the need for a
diplomat to insert himself into the society of the host nation and eventually to rely on
possession goals (such as immunity of diplomatic premises) and milieu goals (for
instance, emphasising the universal mission of the Church).
Seen in chronological order of the historical episodes described above, HS diplomatic
practice seems to move from a realist system, over the rationalist society, towards the
revolutionist world society approach (Wight, 1991). The episode of Hurley illustrates the
persistence of the realist tradition of international society as international system. Caught
in great power rivalries, Hurley aligned himself with one ideological side, using diplo-
matic expertise and legal status to influence foreign policy. In doing so, he practised
diplomacy as `high politics', argued for on moral grounds. The episode of Laboa and his
subtle compliance with international law illustrates renewed rationalist aspirations of
international society at the end of the Cold War. Finally, the episode of Filoni shows a
modality of a Church of the margins, resembling the revolutionist approach of interna-
tional society as world society that seeks to set itself against the state system and its secu-
lar conventions. The episodes also illustrate that HS diplomats are representatives of an
entity that is not their own in terms of inter-state relations. They are born in one country
and represent another political and religious entity to a third country. The hybrid nature of
their agency is thus a rather convenient fact that waives the inherent strangeness that
accompanies ordinary diplomats on their tasks.
Conclusion
Despite the weakening influence of the Eurocentric Catholic Church, HS diplomacy con-
tinues to play a vital role for the Church itself and in international society. In conflicts
around the world either a Catholic majority or a significant Catholic minority is at home.
Moreover, in a global Church its officials are from all over the world rather than only
from the Roman ecosystem. Globally, religion wields an arguably growing influence in
international politics (Thomas, 2010), and there is more space for creative diplomatic
Troy 533
engagement (Constantinou et al., 2016), both of which are significant trends for the future
of understanding diplomacy and international politics. The HS, for example, has found
global reach and mobility accompanying globalisation as a vehicle to overcome the tradi-
tional territorial and nation bound state (Turina, 2015: 201) without giving away its secu-
lar features of diplomatic practice (Parolin, 2017).
A renewed interest in diplomacy is not least propelled by the current Pope and his
intermingling in conflicts around the world (Gaetan, 2015, 2017). He refuses to align
himself in global politics and continues to expand his diplomatic corps (Franco, 2013;
Jones and Mackenzie, 2015). This choice comes as no surprise as diplomacy is constitu-
tive for the participants in international society and thus also the Church: it is a fundamen-
tal and durable practice; it is constitutive of the HS in recognising the world of states and
the formalised way of maintaining official ties therein; and its patterned structure and
agency legitimate its activities in relations to others as it sticks to the formalised rules of
conducting this practice. Particularly, the last point illustrates that HS diplomacy is also a
form of conduct created by a set of standards in which agents are guided by practices.
HS diplomats, as the three episodes of nuncios illustrate, exercise authority under
legal, moral, and expert modalities, weaving together secular and religious discourses and
practices. They are essentially and functionally recognised agents in the international
society that grounds its dialogue on diplomacy. All three trained as diplomats and experts
in their tasks and missions. Based on their religious affiliation, they are nominally also
moral experts. The three episodes illustrate how modalities and discourses interact and
sometimes trump each other. In doing so, they also illustrate that international society is
not a one-way street to a justly governed world society (Wight, 1991: 266).
Early English School scholars put forward the claim that religious institutions are con-
stitutive for international society. Those claims, however, have been picked up only reluc-
tantly in subsequent studies. The entanglement between religious institutions and
international society, after all, remains an understudied topic.29 The theoretical conceptu-
alizations of power, diplomacy, and international society demonstrate insights into the HS
diplomatic conduct while not only framing diplomacy as a category of analysis but also
as one of explanation. Diplomacy is a practice because political units need to interact and
want to stay apart. In the conduct of international society, this gap is filled by the practice
of diplomats, no less so by the ones of the HS. They are even more likely to bridge this
gap because estrangement on the cultural and religious level tends to be low but remains
intact when it comes to secular duties where social distance remains a condition for pur-
suing foreign policy goals. The findings of this article suggest a renewed research interest
looking into the interplay between the hybrid agency of diplomats and structural issues of
international society.

Notes
 1. Especially with the United States (Essig and Moore, 2009; Franco and Flamini, 2008; Rooney, 2013).
 2. In broad terms `practice' and `institution' are synonymous (Little, 2011: 176).
 3. This framing adds to the marginalisation of diplomatic theory (Jönsson and Hall, 2005: 12­19).
 4. Conceptualizations of religion and religious actors suffer the same fate (Fitzgerald, 2011; Sheikh, 2012).
 5. Sharp (2009: 84) points out that:
"there can be no diplomacy when people are completely separate and, hence, unaware of one another. ...
It is when people want those relations with one another, but also want to keep apart, that the conditions
of separateness are created. And these conditions provide the space in which diplomacy and diplomats
work." On the other side, there are never two states that enter diplomatic relations but a state and a de-facto
religious community (since the HS is a legal personality of its own).
 6. Depending on the subject, there is a several decades long archival blockade. Although there is a rich body
of literature on the correspondence of nuncios, those documents are mainly historically interesting (see
for example Koller, 1998). To complicate matters, there is no tradition of memoir literature from nuncios,
except of Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, former nuncio to France (and later Pope John XXIII, 1966).
7. John Paul II's behaviour illustrated this vividly. His predecessor, Roncalli, was a prominent diplomat
before he became Pope John XXIII.
 8. One notable exception is WikiLeaks cover-up of diplomatic communiqués.
 9. See Canon Law canon 363 § 2 and canon 365. Vice versa, diplomats of other states are accredited at the
HS and not at the Vatican.
10. Diplomats accredited to the HS are not physically resident at the Vatican City State (Cismas, 2014:
Chapter 4; Köck, 1975).
11. This effort seems to suggest that the HS became a `secular' actor only after the Lateran Treaties, which
is not the case. Before those treaties the Papal States did not qualify as the Church in an earlier state-like
form. The diplomatic ties then have been only with a selective number of countries. Still, the Church was
a hybrid actor even before the Lateran Treaties but not that complex institutionalised in the sense of an
institution of international society. See critically Morss (2016).
12. The dates refer to the popes tenures.
13. http://goo.gl/mCzczB.l.
14. Canons 362 to 367; http://goo.gl/K9wuE8.
15. This fact suggests that the nuncio could not have been the doyen at the Congress of Vienna if the Papal
state and HS were not part of the international society. In many (mostly Catholic) European countries this
is still the case.
16. See, for example, canon 363, § 1 and canon 364. Revising the Canon law, John Paul II put more emphasis
on ecclesiastical matters to conserve Christian unity (Feldkamp, 2010: 131; Morss, 2016; Turina, 2015).
17. Clerics with an accomplished academic study (at least a theological doctorate) and practical ministerial
experience are trained at the academy in administrative and canon law, diplomacy, history, and at least two
more foreign languages in addition to their mother tongue and Italian. Confidential correspondence with
HS diplomats (emails to the author).
18. http://www.vaticandiplomacy.org; Alvarez (1989: 238)
19. Rome, seen this way, continues to be a centre of world politics when it comes to religious engagement in
foreign policy (Petito and Thomas, 2015).
20. http://goo.gl/cjBcSG. Radio Vatikan (2017).
21. This distinction becomes obvious at its curricula. Students are recruited from the `secular clergy' (that is,
deacons and priests) and stay at least two and at most four years at the academy. Their education covers
several aspects: (1) Courses in the academy are taught by the personnel of the secretary of state on (a)
papal diplomacy by the undersecretary of the section for relations with states, (b) diplomatic style, (c)
international law, and (d) history of papal diplomacy. (2) A one month internship at the secretary of state
during the summer. (3) Meetings with the leaders of ministries at the academy. (4) Language education
during the year and during the summer months. The education takes place at papal universities with the
final achievement of a doctorate within a subject of choice. A degree in canon law is required. If this result
is not achieved, an adequate canonical education is required. Of no lesser significance for the education is
the fact to be permanently based at the academy, under the leadership of someone who usually has been a
papal nuncio or a member of the diplomatic service of the HS. Prominent examples of the reading list are:
Pontificia Accademia Ecclesiastica (2003) and Prudhomme (2004). Confidential correspondence with HS
diplomats (emails to the author).

22. For this conceptualization of practice, see Adler and Pouliot (2011: 6­7) which is different from the one of
the English School that stresses the telic notion of practice. A conventional, causal approach of practice is
helpful to capture the conventional strings of HS diplomacy.
23. There are, for example, various attempts of the HS to establish formal diplomatic ties with China.
Confidential conversation with a former religious non-governmental organisation official.
24. The others are the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the EU (Bátora and Hynek, 2014).
25. This position puts the HS in a dubious light when cooperating with dictatorships on issues such as birth
control (Neale, 1998).
