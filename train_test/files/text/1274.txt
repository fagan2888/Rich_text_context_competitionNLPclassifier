Abstract
Background: Nearly all studies reporting smoking status collect self-reported data. The objective of this
study was to assess sociodemographic characteristics and selected, common smoking-related diseases as
predictors of invalid reporting of non-smoking. Valid self-reported smoking may be related to the degree
to which smoking is a behavior that is not tolerated by the smoker's social group.
Methods: True smoking was defined as having serum cotinine of 15+ng/ml. 1483 "true" smokers 45+
years of age with self-reported smoking and serum cotinine data from the Mobile Examination Center
were identified in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Invalid non-smoking was
defined as "true" smokers self-reporting non-smoking. To assess predictors of invalid self-reported non-
smoking, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for age, race/ethnicity-gender
categories, education, income, diabetes, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Multiple logistic
regression modeling took into account the complex survey design and sample weights.
Results: Among smokers with diabetes, invalid non-smoking status was 15%, ranging from 0% for
Mexican-American (MA) males to 22%­25% for Non-Hispanic White (NHW) males and Non-Hispanic
Black (NHB) females. Among smokers without diabetes, invalid non-smoking status was 5%, ranging from
3% for MA females to 10% for NHB females. After simultaneously taking into account diabetes, education,
race/ethnicity and gender, smokers with diabetes (ORAdj
= 3.15; 95% CI: 1.35­7.34), who did not graduate
from high school (ORAdj
= 2.05; 95% CI: 1.30­3.22) and who were NHB females (ORAdj
= 5.12; 95% CI:
1.41­18.58) were more likely to self-report as non-smokers than smokers without diabetes, who were
high school graduates, and MA females, respectively. Having a history of myocardial infarction or
hypertension did not predict invalid reporting of non-smoking.
Conclusion: Validity of self-reported non-smoking may be related to the relatively slowly progressing
chronic nature of diabetes, in contrast with the acute event of myocardial infarction which could be
considered a more serious, major life changing event. These data also raise questions regarding the
possible role of societal desirability in the validity of self-reported non-smoking, especially among smokers
with diabetes, who did not graduate from high school, and who were NHB females.

Background
Smoking is a major risk factor for many diseases [1],
including highly prevalent conditions such as heart dis-
ease [1-3], diabetes and its complications [1,3-14], and
hypertension [15,16]. According to the Standards of Med-
ical Care in Diabetes, hypertension is a common comor-
bidity of diabetes, "In these patients, other cardiovascular risk
factors including obesity, hyperlidemia, smoking ... should be
carefully assessed and treated." [17]. These standards of care
support smoking cessation counseling as a necessary com-
ponent of comprehensive approaches to manage patients
with diabetes because smoking is related to macrovascular
and microvascular complications of diabetes [17]. How-
ever, neither health care providers nor individuals with
diabetes are sufficiently aware of the increased risk of
developing cardiovascular disease for smokers with diabe-
tes [18,19]. Preventive care to reduce the risk of future car-
diac events includes interventions targeting type 2
diabetes, obesity and insulin resistance such as the use of
medications and lifestyle changes to stop smoking,
increase exercise, and incorporate diet modification to
lower blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and choles-
terol [17,20-24]. Health care providers' compliance with
diabetes-related preventive care has been low [25].
While smoking status is routinely measured through self-
report, the validity of such self-reported smoking data
may be suspect because individuals may give invalid self-
report of their smoking status. Carbon monoxide and nic-
otine/cotinine are widely used biomarkers of tobacco or
tobacco smoke exposure providing objective measures of
smoking data [26-32]. Nearly all studies reporting smok-
ing status collect self-reported data that are very rarely val-
idated. For example, there were 191 original articles,
clinical practice, clinical implications of basic research
and health policy reports with "smoking" in the text of the
New England Journal of Medicine from January 2001
through December 2005, of which 1.0% (n = 2) included
cotinine-determined smoking measures.
Self-reported smoking status underestimates smoking
prevalence in certain populations [33-35]. Data relevant
to identifying smokers who deny smoking in a meta-anal-
ysis on validity of self-reported smoking status reported
an average 13% of "true" smokers reported invalid non-
smoking status, with a wide variation ranging from 0% to
94% [36]. This wide variation may be related to the differ-
ent study designs including distinct objective measures of
smoking such as carbon monoxide, carboxyhemoglobin,
thiocyanate, serum or salivary cotinine, and very different
study populations.
One important question is whether the proportion of
respondents who smoke but report they are not smoking
is a systematic (i.e. differential) misclassification bias so as
to confound the relationships between predictors and
dependent variables. Smoking misclassification bias has
been found with a correlation as low as 0.40 between self-
reported and cotinine-determined smoking [31]. Invalid
reporting of smoking may explain the effect of a main
exposure (eg. beta-carotene), indicating the need to
include biomarkers of smoking in epidemiologic studies
[31]. In other words, if smoking is measured with error,
and smoking is associated with an exposure of interest, it
will be difficult to rule out smoking as the true cause of the
association between the exposure of interest and the out-
come, hence leading to a biased estimate.
When looking at the evidence, with respect to significant
proportions of smokers who self-reported as non-smokers
in population-based studies, it may be expected that the
more social pressure exists against smoking in a society or
the personally relevant social network of the smoker, the
larger may be her/his propensity to deny smoking. It is
hypothesized that people who have or have had smoking-
related severe diseases such as diabetes or myocardial inf-
arction have a strong propensity to deny smoking. Thus,
there are sociodemographic characteristics such as age,
race/ethnicity, gender, education and income, along with
smoking-related diseases in which patients are advised
not to smoke, that may be of relevance for invalid self-
reported statements.
The current literature supports a recommendation that
self-reported smoking status be confirmed by biochemical
verification [26-32,37]. Descriptive studies found many
patients deny smoking [38], even after having been
informed that they would be tested for tobacco smoke
exposure [39]. A research approach referred to as the
"bogus pipeline" strategy, informs study participants that
their self-reports can or will be verified by a monitoring
device [40]. As applied to self-reported tobacco use, par-
ticipants are informed that their self-reports can or will be
verified by a biochemical test, then specimens are col-
lected but not analyzed. This approach may not be rele-
vant to the third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) participants because
they were aware that their serum would be tested for many
components, but there was not a focus on the cotinine
assay.
Typically, studies reporting on validity of self-reported
smoking for different groups have used a single covariate,
such as, race [41,42], age [43,44], gender [44], social class
[44], marital status [44], education [44]; or race-gender
categories [45]. While the question of the accuracy of self-
reported smoking has been previously reported, this ques-
tion has not been approached through a population-
based study simultaneously assessing age, race/ethnicity-
gender, education, income, and smoking-related diseases

as predictors of invalid self-reported non-smoking by
"true" smokers. Previous studies focused on self-reported
smoking as the denominator, not on "true" smokers. That
is, previous studies investigated the question, among
those who report they smoke or do not smoke, what pro-
portion truly smoke or do not smoke. But, there has not
been a focus on the question, among those who truly
smoke, what proportion report they do not smoke.
The objectives of our study include: (1) Describe sociode-
mographic characteristics and smoking-related disease
status for valid and invalid reporting of smoking status by
"true" smokers; and (2) Assess predictors by quantifying
the association between invalid self-reported non-smok-
ing and age, race/ethnicity, gender, income, education,
diabetes, myocardial infarction, and hypertension, among
"true" smokers in NHANES III [46].
Methods
Study population
The third NHANES, 1988­1994 is a national examination
survey of civilian noninstitutionalized individuals, repre-
sentative of the US population. NHANES employs a com-
plex, multistage, stratified, clustered sample design.
NHANES includes questionnaire, laboratory assays and
clinical examination measures of health outcomes and
explanatory variables. The data relevant to this study are:
responses to questions regarding age, race/ethnicity, gen-
der, household income, education, history of tobacco use,
diabetes, myocardial infarction, hypertension, and labo-
ratory assay of serum cotinine. This study was reviewed by
the Case Western Reserve University institutional review
board and approved as exempt under 45 Code of Federal
Regulations part 46.101b, #4, IRB Protocol Number
20050805. In addition, all investigators complied with
the Data Use Restrictions for the NHANES III public-use
data set.
Participants provided informed consent to voluntarily
participate in the interview, or the interview and examina-
tion, or the interview, examination and laboratory tests
[46]. We identified 7295 adults, ages 45+ years, who com-
pleted the Household Adult Questionnaire indicating
they did not currently use smokeless tobacco, pipe or
cigars, and completed the Mobile Examination Center
(MEC) question "How many cigarettes have you smoked
in the past 5 days?" and reported they did not use nicotine
gum in the past 5 days. Among the 7295 participants with
MEC smoking status 410 (4.3% weighted percent) did not
have serum cotinine data, resulting in 6885 adults, ages
45+ years, who did not use smokeless tobacco, pipe,
cigars, or nicotine gum with MEC smoking status and
MEC serum cotinine data. Thus, we studied 1483 (22.0%
weighted percent) cotinine-determined smokers 45+
years of age in the NHANES III data set who did not cur-
rently use smokeless tobacco, pipe, cigars, or nicotine
gum. We restricted our analyses to 45+ year olds because
studies investigating diabetes and myocardial infarction
typically assess individuals who develop the condition at
this age [5-15].
Definition of main outcome
The main outcome was invalid non-smoking status,
defined as "true" smokers who self-reported as non-smok-
ers during the MEC component of NHANES III. Cotinine
is a biochemical measure of tobacco exposure, it is a
metabolite of nicotine indicating exposure during the pre-
vious 1 to 2 days [29]. Serum cotinine was assayed using
an isotope dilution, liquid chromatography, tandem mass
spectrometry method with a limit of detection of 0.03 ng/
ml [46]. Thus, we used this gold standard to identify
"true" smokers as those adults with serum cotinine levels
15+ng/ml [29,47]. The definition of cotinine-determined
smokers was based on the finding that serum cotinine
level has a bimodal distribution, with a separation
between the two peaks at serum cotinine level of 10­15
ng/ml. This distinguishes active tobacco use and second-
hand smoke exposure because the highest serum cotinine
level in a nonsmoker exposed to second hand smoke is
10­13 ng/ml [30]. Thus, we used the more conservative
cutpoint of 15 ng/ml of serum cotinine to identify coti-
nine-determined smokers who self-reported they cur-
rently do not smoke. Henceforth, we will refer to cotinine-
determined smokers as "true" smokers.
Definition of explanatory variables
To meet the objectives of our study we assessed the role
that smoking-related diseases may play in the validity of
self-reported smoking status by focusing on three highly
prevalent smoking-related diseases. We also assessed soci-
odemographic characteristics that play a role in disease
status and may play a role in the amount of social pressure
against smoking in the individual's social network. Thus,
the potential explanatory variables for invalid self-
reported non-smoking status by "true" smokers were age,
race/ethnicity, gender, household income, education, dia-
betes, myocardial infarction, and hypertension status. Age
was dichotomized as 45­64 versus 65+ years of age using
categories previously used for NHANES publications [48],
with six race/ethnicity-gender categories, namely Non-
Hispanic White (NHW) females, Non-Hispanic Black
(NHB) females, Mexican-American (MA) females, NHW
males, NHB males, and MA males. The race/ethnicity cat-
egory "other" was excluded due to small or zero cell
counts. Household income and education were dichot-
omized as categories previously used in NHANES publica-
tions, such that household income was defined as less
than $20,000 versus at least $20,000; and education was
dichotomized as high school graduate (Yes/No) [49,50].

To further elucidate potential explanatory variables, we
assessed three highly prevalent smoking-related diseases
in which patients are advised not to smoke, namely diabe-
tes, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. While we
hypothesized that people who suffer from these smoking-
related diseases may have a strong propensity to deny
smoking, we recognize the current clinical guidelines rec-
ommend that all patients who use tobacco be advised to
quit [51], not just those who already have disease. For
males, diabetes status was based on their response to
whether they were ever told by a doctor that they had dia-
betes or sugar diabetes (Yes/No). Females were defined as
having diabetes if they had been told by a doctor that they
had diabetes or sugar diabetes when they were not preg-
nant. Women with diabetes only during pregnancy were
defined as not having diabetes. Participants responding
that a doctor ever told them that they had a heart attack
were defined as having a history of myocardial infarction,
and those responding that they were told by a doctor or
other health professional that they had hypertension, on
two or more different visits were defined as having hyper-
tension.
Statistical analyses
We compared invalid self-reported non-smoking among
age, race/ethnicity-gender categories, education, and
household income for "true" smokers with and without
diabetes, history of myocardial infarction, and hyperten-
sion. This study compared two distinct measures of smok-
ing status, self-reported questionnaire data and laboratory
assay results for serum cotinine. SAS-callable SUDAAN
[52] was used for all analyses, to account for complex sur-
vey design and sample weights in NHANES III. To assess
predictors of invalid self-reported non-smoking we quan-
tified the association between invalid self-reported non-
smoking and age, race/ethnicity-gender categories
(reported to indicate interaction), income, education, dia-
betes, history of myocardial infarction, and hypertension
by calculating the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI) for both the unadjusted or crude OR
(ORCrude
), and the adjusted OR (ORAdj
) using multiple
logistic regression modeling, simultaneously adjusting for
the potential explanatory variables.
Results
Overall descriptive summary
The descriptive summary for invalid self-reported non-
smoking by "true" smokers, who do not currently use
smokeless tobacco, pipe, cigars or nicotine gum is
reported in Table 1, along with the ORCrude
for the associ-
ation between invalid self-reported non-smoking and the
potential explanatory variables. The overall invalid
reported non-smoking was 5.8%. Older "true" smokers
65+years old (12.6%) were almost 4 times (ORCrude
=
3.88, 95% CI: 1.95­7.73) more likely to report invalid
non-smoking than 45­64 year olds (3.6%). NHB smokers
(8.5%) were 1 1/2 times (ORCrude
= 1.53; 95% CI: 1.04­
2.26) more likely to report invalid non-smoking than
NHW smokers (5.8%). Smokers who did not graduate
from high school (8.6%) were twice as likely (ORCrude
=
2.04; 95% CI: 1.35­3.08) to report non-smoking as high
school graduates (4.4%). Smokers with diabetes (15.0%)
were over 3 times (ORCrude
= 3.26; 95% CI: 1.38­7.72)
more likely to report non-smoking than smokers without
diabetes (5.1%). There was no statistically significant
association between invalid self-reported non-smoking
and gender, income, history of myocardial infarction, or
hypertension.
Invalid self-reported non-smoking by "true" smokers with
and without diabetes
The age-specific descriptive summary of "true" smokers
self-reporting their smoking status is reported in Table 2,
along with six gender-race/ethnicity specific categories,
stratified by diabetes status. The proportion of "true"
smokers with diabetes reporting non-smoking was higher
for 65+ year olds (19.8%) than for 45­64 year olds
(12.3%). Among 45+ year old smokers with diabetes,
15.0% self-reported as non-smokers, ranging from 0.0%
of MA males, to 21.5% of NHW males and 25.4% of NHB
females. Among "true" smokers without diabetes the pro-
portion self-reporting invalid non-smoking was higher for
older adults, with 3.0% of 45­64 year olds compared to
11.9% of 65+ year olds. Among 45+ year old smokers
without diabetes, 5.1% self-reported as non-smokers,
ranging from 2.5% of MA females, to 6.8% of MA males
and 9.5% of NHB females.
Invalid self-reported non-smoking by "true" smokers with
and without a history of myocardial infarction
In Table 2, the proportion of "true" smokers with a history
of myocardial infarction reporting non-smoking was
higher for 65+ year olds (15.6%) than for 45­64 year olds
(1.9%). Among 45+ year old "true" smokers with a history
of myocardial infarction, 6.4% self-reported as non-smok-
ers, ranging from 0.0% of MA females, to 37.0% of MA
males. Among "true" smokers without a history of myo-
cardial infarction the proportion self-reporting invalid
non-smoking was higher for 65+ year olds (12.4%) than
for 45­64 year olds (3.7%). Among 45+ year old "true"
smokers without a history of myocardial infarction, 5.8%
self-reported as non-smokers, ranging from 3.3%­6.6%
of MA females, MA males, NHW females, NHB males and
NHW males, to 11.8% of NHB females.
Invalid self-reported non-smoking by "true" smokers with
and without hypertension
In Table 2, the proportion of "true" smokers with hyper-
tension reporting non-smoking was higher among older
smokers with 11.6% of 65+ year olds compared to 5.2%
BMC Public Health 2007, 7:33 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/7/33

of 45­64 year olds. Among 45+ year old true "smokers"
with hypertension, 7.0% self-reported as non-smokers,
ranging from 2.9% of MA females, to 15.6% of MA males.
Among "true" smokers without hypertension the propor-
tion self-reporting invalid non-smoking was higher
among older smokers with 13.2% of 65+ year olds com-
pared to 3.0% of 45­64 year olds. Among 45+ year old
"true" smokers without hypertension, 5.3% self-reported
as non-smokers, ranging from 3.2%­4.9% of MA females,
NHW females, MA males, and NHB males, to 11.0% of
NHB females.
Association between invalid self-reported non-smoking
and diabetes, history of myocardial infarction,
hypertension, and socioeconomic status
The most parsimonious model for the association
between invalid self-reported non-smoking and diabetes,
simultaneously adjusting for education, and race/ethnic-
ity-gender is reported in Table 3. Among "true" smokers,
those with diabetes (ORAdj
= 3.15; 95% CI: 1.35­7.34)
and NHB females (ORAdj
= 5.12; 95% CI: 1.41­18.58)
were 3 to 5 times more likely to report non-smoking than
those without diabetes, and MA females, respectively.
Among "true" smokers, those who did not graduate from
high school (ORAdj
= 2.05; 95% CI: 1.30­3.22) and NHB
females (ORAdj
= 1.96; 95% CI: 1.17­3.28) were twice as
likely to report non-smoking as high school graduates and
NHW females, respectively. When we tested a full-model
simultaneously adjusting for all three smoking-related
diseases, this did not change any conclusions. In the full
model the point-estimate for diabetes was essentially
unchanged (ORAdj
= 3.13; 95% CI: 1.33­7.35) and history
of myocardial infarction (P = 0.97) and hypertension (P =
0.71) were non-significant variables; therefore they were
excluded in the final model.
Discussion
Invalid self-reported non-smoking by "true" smokers is a
critical aspect for the clinical management of smokers,
when estimating smoking prevalence, estimating excess

morbidity and mortality associated with smoking, and
when collecting smoking data in clinical trials and surveys
and other observational studies. Our study found "true"
smokers with diabetes were more likely to report invalid
non-smoking than "true" smokers without diabetes, but
having a history of myocardial infarction or hypertension
did not predict invalid reporting of non-smoking. A pos-
sible explanation for these different results regarding pre-
dictors of invalid self-reported non-smoking may be
related to the relatively slowly progressing chronic nature
of diabetes compared to acute myocardial infarction
which could be considered a more serious, major life
changing event. This possibility is based on the finding
that smokers who had a history of myocardial infarction
were over four times more likely to quit smoking than
those being diagnosed with diabetes [53], and that dura-
tion of diabetes was not associated with smoking [54].
Thus smokers who had a history of myocardial infarction
may be more likely to truly quit smoking than smokers
with diabetes or hypertension.
A possible explanation for our results differing from pre-
vious reports may be related to our modeling approach.
We assessed invalid self-reported non-smoking by "true"
smokers as the outcome, fitting diabetes, education, race/
ethnicity and gender main effects along with an interac-
tion term, whereas the other approaches were based on
unadjusted analyses or multiple regression analyses of
self-reported smoking without interaction terms. The
incorporation of an interaction term for race/ethnicity
and gender allows for the ascertainment of "true" smokers
who are more likely to report non-smoking, in order to
develop a targeted approach to identify smokers for smok-
ing cessation interventions. This is important in light of
the findings that health care providers and individuals
with diabetes are not sufficiently aware of the increased
risk of developing cardiovascular disease for smokers with
diabetes [18,19].
To the best of our knowledge our study is the first popula-
tion-based report on invalid self-reported non-smoking
restricted to those who do not currently use smokeless
tobacco, pipe, cigars, or nicotine gum. Even though there
may be some invalid responses to the use of non-cigarette
tobacco products, these products were used much less fre-
quently in NHANES III with 4990 current cigarette smok-
ers compared to 602 current smokeless tobacco users, 296
current cigar users and 148 current pipe users. If the pro-
portion of adults who report invalid non-tobacco use is
similar for each tobacco group, cigarette users would be
impacted the most because of the higher prevalence. This
may explain why our results differ from previous reports.
Due to this restriction, our study had limited statistical
power related to the small sample size in the age, race/eth-
nicity-gender specific subgroup analyses, especially when
the analyses were stratified by diabetes, history of myocar-
dial infarction, and hypertension history. While the oldest
(i.e., 65+ year old) "true" smokers were more likely to self-
report non-smoking than 44­64 year olds, the effect of
age was not assessed further due to the small sample size
of younger smokers with diabetes or history of myocardial
infarction who self-reported as non-smokers.
Deception may explain most of the invalid self-reports of
non-smoking [55]. Social desirability related to the social
unacceptability of cigarette smoking [56] is an additional
possible explanation of the invalid self-reported non-
smoking status by "true" smokers. That is, NHB female
smokers, smokers with diabetes or who did not graduate
from high school may be more prone to being influenced

by social pressure to not smoke and thus provide the
socially desirable non-smoking response.
In addition, other researchers have investigated potential
explanations for serum cotinine levels in non-smokers,
including dietary intake of food items previously reported
to have measurable levels of nicotine, such as potatoes,
tomatoes, eggplant, cauliflower, green peppers, iced tea,
and brewed tea [29]. These food items were not significant
in the regression models for adults [29].
We believe this limitation is outweighed by the following
strengths of our study: 1) focusing on the most relevant
patient management, public health surveillance, and
study design issues of "true" smokers by incorporating an
objective measure to complement self-report; 2) analyses
restricted to those who did not currently use smokeless
tobacco, cigars, pipes, or nicotine gum addressed the lim-
itation of cotinine being elevated in users of snuff and
chewing tobacco [36]; 3) our modeling approach
included race/ethnicity-gender interaction; 4) NHANES
III sampling methodology is designed to represent the US
population; 5) high quality and quantity of question-
naire, examination and laboratory data collected in an
unbiased manner such that the participants were unaware
of our study on predictors of invalid self-reporting of non-
smoking status.
"True" smokers reporting non-smoking have higher mor-
tality rates, higher prevalence of tobacco-related cancer,
and higher prevalence of a history of myocardial infarc-
tion compared to true nonsmokers [43]. Our findings
indicate that the impact of invalid self-reported non-
smoking on morbidity and mortality may slightly under-
estimate the true impact for 45­64 year olds, with a more
substantially under-estimate for 65+ year olds. In addi-
tion, the Healthy People 2010 objective 27-1a to reduce
smoking prevalence [57,58] is based on self-reported data
that are generally reported to be valid [36]. However,
apparently not considered was the wide variability in the
proportion of smokers reporting they were not smokers
ranging from 0% to 94% [36]. Our findings raise concerns
regarding invalid self-reported non-smoking by specific
age, race/ethnicity-gender, education or diabetes. Addi-
tional research using a similar approach with larger sam-
ple sizes, that simultaneously takes into account
sociodemographic and health status characteristics is
needed to investigate this study's findings further.
These findings have potentially important general impli-
cations. An objective assessment of tobacco use, either
through a targeted approach by health care providers, or
as the general protocol when collecting tobacco use data
in a population surveillance, clinical, or epidemiologic
study, identifies smokers who deny smoking. Three gen-
eral implications are: 1) Identification of smokers who
deny smoking provides an opportunity for health care
providers to present tobacco cessation counseling to those
individuals who would not otherwise receive such advice,
with the objective being the improvement of the individ-
ual patient's health. 2) Collection of an objective measure
of current tobacco use may provide a better estimate of the
true prevalence rates in the population and/or among the
specific age, race, and gender subgroups. 3) Using an
objective measure of tobacco use in a clinical or epidemi-
ologic study addresses the possible explanation that the
results may be due to systematic misclassification bias of
self-reported tobacco use.
One approach to address smoking misclassification in
clinical or epidemiologic studies would be the develop-
ment of a statistical approach, similar to those available
but limited to a single covariate [59,60]. Alternative
approaches include incorporating objective smoking
measures to complement self-report by excluding "true"
smokers who report never, or former tobacco use, or to
create and assess a separate category of "true" smokers
who report never or former tobacco use. Even though
objective tobacco use measures identify current "true"
tobacco-users, and most smoking-related diseases are
chronic requiring a smoking history, by excluding "true"
smokers self-reporting non-smoking (i.e., never or former
smoking) this decreases smoking misclassification bias,
and may decrease bias associated with other inaccurate
responses such as self-reported disease status. Further
investigation of questions assessing the validity of self-
reported smoking status may also be useful.
Conclusion
We found non-random or systematic bias, indicating the
inability to determine the direction in which reported esti-
mates differ from the true effects (under-estimate, over-
estimate, or true estimate). Validity of self-reported non-
smoking may be related to the relatively slowly progress-
ing chronic nature of diabetes, in contrast with the acute
event of myocardial infarction which could be considered
a more serious, major life changing event. These data also
raise questions regarding the possible role of societal
desirability in the validity of self-reported non-smoking,
especially among "true" smokers with diabetes, NHB
females, and those who did not graduate from high
school. Health care providers may consider using objec-
tive measures of tobacco use, especially among those sub-
groups that are more likely to deny smoking, followed by
tobacco cessation counseling and intervention informa-
tion. Studies collecting self-reported smoking data must
address the potentially invalid reporting of non-smoking,
and should include a statement about the potentially
biased estimate.
