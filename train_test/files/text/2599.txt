Abstract
Objective: A growing literature documents the importance of physical attractiveness in young and middle adulthood for
romantic, marital, and sexual relationships, but little is known about how attractiveness in adolescence matters to intimate
relationships in later life. We ask: does attractiveness early in life convey ongoing benefits late in life, or do such benefits
erode over time?
Methods: We use multivariate regression models and more than 50 years of data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study
to examine the connections between adolescent physical attractiveness and intimate relationships (i.e., sexual activity and
access to potential sexual partners) in later life.
Results: We find that adolescent attractiveness facilitates sexual activity in later life. This relationship is largely driven by
attractiveness increasing the probability of having access to potential sexual partners. However, attractiveness is not related
to sexual activity among married couples, even after controlling for marital duration. Men, those in good health, and
wealthier individuals are also more likely to engage in several facets of intimate relationships.
Discussion: These findings highlight the importance of relationship context for later life sexual activity and begin to expli-
cate the pathways through which factors across the life course--particularly attractiveness--influence sexual activity in
later life.

A growing literature documents the importance of physi-
cal attractiveness in romantic, marital, and sexual relation-
ships. Several recent studies have examined the implications
of measures of attractiveness for intimate relationships
(e.g., McClintock, 2014; Weitzman & Conley, 2014) and
document a "love premium" for beauty in which physically
attractive people (as measured by height, weight, or facial
beauty) are more likely to be in marital, dating, and sexual
heterosexual relationships. While intriguing, these studies
tend to focus on adolescence through middle age, and thus
generate additional questions, particularly regarding how
sustained the advantages of early life attractiveness are
across the life course. Does attractiveness early in life have
an ongoing effect decades later, and if so, why? Or do these
physical benefits erode and lose significance for our pros-
pects of intimate relationships as we age? Is our face truly
our fortune?
To address these questions, we use data from the
Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), a prospective
study based on a one-third sample of the Wisconsin high
school graduating class of 1957. The WLS has a number
of advantages over prior work, including face-based meas-
ures of attractiveness validated by multiple raters, multi-
ple measures of intimate relationships later in life, as well

as a rich array of covariates. These data allow us to track
whether physical attractiveness at adolescence, based on
ratings of high school yearbook photos, is associated with
sexual activity overall and among married people, as well
as unmarried sexual relationships (referred to jointly in
this article as "intimate relationships") later in life, as the
WLS cohort enter their 60s and 70s. The richness of the
data allows us to control for and model many potential
additional covariates, such as socioeconomic status, health,
and personality, which may explain potential associations
between attractiveness and intimate relationships, and/or
be important predictors of intimate relationships in and of
themselves.
Attractiveness and Intimate Relationships across
the Life Course
A large and growing literature documents the importance
of physical traits for intimate relationships. Dimensions
of physical attractiveness such as facial attractiveness
(McClintock, 2014), height (Weitzman & Conley, 2014),
and weight (Fikkan & Rothblum, 2012) have been associ-
ated with a variety of intimate relationships in the repro-
ductive stage of the life course. Dating is associated with
height and weight (Cawley, Joyner, & Sobal, 2006) as well
as researcher ratings of photographs (Luo & Zhang, 2009),
cohabitation is linked to obesity (Mukhopadhyay, 2008),
and marriage is related to height (Harper, 2000; Weitzman
& Conley, 2014) and obesity (Harper, 2000). Dimensions
of physical attractiveness are also linked to sexual behavior
specifically. For example, Brody (2004) found that slimmer
people more frequently engaged in vaginal intercourse in
late adolescence through middle age. Among young men,
a composite measure of attractiveness based on researcher
and self-reports is also positively associated with number
of sexual partners (Bogaert & Fisher, 1995; McClintock,
2011). In addition, more attractive people may enjoy lasting
benefits in their relationships. Margolin and White (1987)
found that as spouses--especially husbands--perceived
declining spousal attractiveness, they became less inter-
ested in sex, became less happy in the sexual relationship,
and were more likely to be unfaithful. Analysis of personal
advertisement descriptions (Alterovitz & Mendelsohn,
2009) and qualitative interviews of older online daters
(McWilliams & Barrett, 2014) also document the salience
of attractiveness in internet dating among older adults.
Most studies have only looked at the relationship
between attractiveness and one aspect of intimate relation-
ships, though attractiveness may play a different role in
the initial attraction of a sexual partner than in the sexual
relationship between long-married people. In the present
study, we advance the literature by examining the relation-
ship between adolescent facial attractiveness and a variety
of outcomes in later life including sexual activity overall
and among married and unmarried people. This helps us
to understand whether attractiveness functions differently
if someone is attracting a new partner (as well as how this
might vary by life course stage) or engaging in sexual activ-
ity within an established relationship.
There are a number of potential reasons why physi-
cal attractiveness matters for intimate relationships. First,
attractiveness facilitates sexual activity, which is impor-
tant for intimate relationships (Bogaert & Fisher, 1995;
Margolin & White, 1987; McClintock, 2011). In addi-
tion, biological evolutionary theories argue that "attrac-
tive" traits signal reproductive and genetic fitness as well
as general good health (Buss & Schmitt, 1993). Using the
WLS, Jokela (2009) found that both more attractive male
and female adolescents had more children than their less
attractive counterparts. However, the fact that attractive-
ness remains a preferred characteristic among older daters
(Alterovitz & Mendelsohn, 2009; McWilliams & Barrett,
2014) points to social and cultural explanations rather
than evolutionary theory in explaining the importance of
attractiveness in at least some types of intimate relation-
ships in later life.
Attractiveness may also be related to sexual activity via
health, though extant evidence is mixed. Using WLS data,
Reither, Hauser, and Swallen (2009) found that a meas-
ure of adolescent facial mass was predictive of mortality
in late midlife, with increased risk of nonaccidental death
and heart disease mortality among those who were over-
weight according to high school photographs. Another
study also using WLS examined a measure of adolescent
facial attractiveness independent of body mass and did
not find an association with mortality (Scholz & Sicinski,
2015). These mixed findings suggest that variation in the
relationship between attractiveness and health depends
on the particular measure of attractiveness used. Further,
attractiveness ratings themselves are frequently influenced
by factors such as socioeconomic background (Scholz &
Sicinski, 2015).
Attractiveness may also matter in intimate relation-
ships via social pathways. First, a large number of studies
document that attractive people enjoy a wage premium
(Fikkan & Rothblum, 2012; Hamermesh & Biddle, 1994;
Scholz & Sicinski, 2015). Theories from social psychology
propose that more attractive people benefit from advan-
taged social contexts because of the "halo effect" of the
esteem of others (Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, & Longo,
1991) and because more attractive individuals internal-
ize these favorable evaluations, fostering personality
characteristics which may also encourage intimate rela-
tionships (Berscheid & Walster, 1974). Attractive children
and adults are evaluated more favorably by others and
are treated better (Langlois et al., 2000). Perhaps in part
because of this better treatment, attractive people are less
socially anxious and more socially skilled (Feingold, 1992)
and are more likely to report higher levels of extraversion
and lower levels of neuroticism (Scholz & Sicinski, 2015).
Social skills--reflected in part via the personality trait of
extraversion--may make attractive people more likely to
188 Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2017, Vol. 72, No. 1
engage in social situations where potential romantic part-
ners may be encountered. Low neuroticism, which entails
low levels of a variety of negative emotions, may promote
relationship maintenance via relationship satisfaction and
intimacy (Fisher & McNulty, 2008; White, Hendrick, &
Hendrick, 2004). Given these linkages between attractive-
ness and personality as well as the importance of early
life for personality development and its relative stability
across the life course (Caspi & Roberts, 2001), early life
attractiveness may play an important role in shaping adult
personality. In addition, favorable treatment and associ-
ated low levels of negative emotions may foster positive
dimensions of well-being among attractive people such as
self-acceptance, which has consequential implications for
sexual outcomes (Cornwell & Laumann, 2011). Although
these psychological correlates of attractiveness may also
play an important role in individuals' abilities to estab-
lish intimate relationships with others, the literature has
largely ignored these potential pathways. This makes
it difficult to assess the degree to which factors such as
personality characteristics like extraversion predict the
establishment of intimate relationships independent of
attractiveness, or are themselves at least partly a function
of attractiveness.
Additional Determinants of Intimate
Relationships in the Later Life Course
Prior literature has identified several additional determi-
nants of sexual activity in later life. We briefly summarize
these here. First, earlier work has identified the impor-
tance of gender for intimate relationships in later life. Men
are more likely to be partnered in later life, a necessary
but insufficient condition for partnered sexual activity
(Karraker, DeLamater, & Schwartz, 2011; Lindau, et al.,
2007). Within relationships, men are also more likely to be
sexually active (Karraker & DeLamater, 2013), a relation-
ship that may reflect age hypergamy and other factors.
Intimate relationships in later life are also predicted
by physical and psychological health (Lindau et al.,
2007), including a variety of physical health conditions
(DeLamater & Sill, 2005), as well as self-rated physical and
mental health (Karraker & DeLamater, 2013; Karraker,
DeLamater, & Schwartz 2011). Further, health may also
be associated with partnership to the extent that partners
seek healthy mates, because of desires for sexual activity, to
avoid caregiving, or other reasons (England & McClintock,
2009).
Finally, socioeconomic and other factors are also linked
to intimate relationships in later life. Education and finan-
cial resources are valued by both men and women in poten-
tial partners across the life course (England & McClintock,
2009; McClintock, 2014). Education also helps shape atti-
tudes and beliefs about sexual activity earlier in the life
course (Laumann et al., 1994). Finally, wealthier people
are more likely to repartner, either via remarriage or via
cohabitation, in later life (Vespa, 2012).
The Present Study
Although the prior work on attractiveness and inti-
mate relationships is intriguing, little is known about
the potential enduring role of attractiveness in later
life. Work that has examined the role of attractiveness
in intimate relationships in later life has relied on con-
venience samples examining internet dating (Alterovitz
& Mendelsohn, 2009; McWilliams & Barrett, 2014).
Dating is an increasingly important relationship context
for older adults, but the role of attractiveness may dif-
fer in dating versus marital relationships, in part because
those who are dating are a select group of older adults
who are more advantaged in terms of education, assets,
health, and social connectedness than nondaters (Brown
& Shinohara, 2013). Given that attractiveness may be a
strong predictor of partnership, and partnership in turn
predicts sexual activity in later life (Karraker, DeLamater,
& Schwartz, 2011), early life attractiveness may facili-
tate continued sexual activity in later life because of its
connections with partnership earlier in the life course.
In addition, because more attractive people benefit from
better health and socioeconomic status, as well as cer-
tain personality traits, these factors may also serve as
potential mechanisms linking attractiveness and intimate
relationship outcomes. Further, it is unclear whether
attractiveness (and other factors) will have the same
association with intimate relationship outcomes within
different stages in the later life course. Using the WLS, we
address these gaps by examining the association between
attractiveness and a variety of intimate relationship out-
comes (sexual activity, marital status, unmarried partner-
ship status), as well as the potential explanatory role of
factors such as health, socioeconomic status, and person-
ality at older ages.
Method
We use data from the WLS to explore the connections
between attractiveness and intimate relationships in later
life. The WLS is a one-third random sample of Wisconsin
high school graduates from the class of 1957 (born in
approximately 1939). Respondents were interviewed in
1957 (~age 18 years), 1975 (~age 35 years), 1992 (~age
53 years), and 2004 (~age 64 years). We also conducted
additional analysis examining 2011 data (~age 71 years).
We do not present these results (available upon request)
as they generally do not differ from results for outcomes
in 2004.
The WLS provides a unique opportunity to exam-
ine the role of adolescent attractiveness in later life inti-
mate relationships as well as the pathways across the life
course through which attractiveness impacts these out-
comes. However, because the WLS is a distinctive cohort
with unique racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and cultural
characteristics, it is unclear how it compares with nation-
ally representative data. To address this, we compare our
189
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2017, Vol. 72, No. 1
sample with men and women from the first wave (collected
2005­2006) of the National Social Life, Health and Aging
Project (NSHAP) who were born 1937­1941, were White,
and had at least a high school education. We weighted
NSHAP statistics with survey-provided weights that
account for differential probabilities of selection, making
our NSHAP statistics representative of White Americans
born 1937­1941 with at least a high school education. We
found that the prevalence of sexual activity, marital status,
availability of a (potential) sexual partner, and sexual activ-
ity within marriage was similar between WLS and NSHAP
(Supplementary Material).
Dependent Variables: Intimate Relationships at
Age 64
We examine three outcomes in 2004 when respondents
are 64 years old. Our first outcome is a dichotomous
measure of being sexually active for the entire sample to
establish a broad picture of the determinants of sexual
activity in later life. In order for respondents to be asked
about sexual frequency (the basis of the dichotomous "is
sexually active" outcome measure), the respondent had
to report being currently married or, if unmarried, also
report having a sexual partner. Respondents who were
neither married nor unmarried not reporting a sexual
partner were assigned a value of zero sexual frequency.
Given the importance of partner availability for sexual
activity, and that both marital and non-marital (i.e., dat-
ing) relationships provide access to partners, our second
outcome is a measure of access to (potential) sexual
partnership. This is based in part on a question posed to
unmarried respondents on whether they have access to a
sexual partner. To examine whether adolescent attractive-
ness matters to access to partners among the unmarried
later in life as well as in marriage, we compare the relative
risk ratios of being unmarried with a sexual partner and
being married compared with being unmarried without a
sexual partner. Finally, as marriage is a key relationship
context for sexual activity in later life, our third outcome
is a dichotomous measure of sexual activity among the
currently married. Sexual activity for the first and third
outcomes was ascertained using the question: "During
the past 12 months, about how often did you have sex
with your spouse or partner?" in the mail questionnaire.
Responses were then recoded as dichotomous variables in
which 0 = no sexual activity and 1 = any sexual activity.
The examination of the role of adolescent attractive-
ness for relationships formed in early midlife (generally
appearing as long-term marriages in our data) and later life
(unmarried sexual partnerships), as well as sexual activity
within the context of marriage enables us to examine how
the relationship between adolescent attractiveness and sex-
ual expression may vary by life course stage and relationship
context. Given theoretical and empirical work that suggests
the importance of attractiveness for initial partnering, we
expect that adolescent attractiveness will matter most for
the formation of marriage earlier in the life course. We also
examined the association between adolescent attractive-
ness and interviewer reports of respondent attractiveness at
age 71--the only measure of attractiveness available in the
WLS in later life. Adolescent attractiveness is only weakly
associated with later-life attractiveness (|r| = .13) (authors'
calculations, available on request). Given this fact and prior
work (e.g., Karraker & DeLamater, 2013) that finds that
sexual expression in long-term marriages is strongly associ-
ated with health and marital quality, we expect adolescent
attractiveness will have a weaker or nonrelationship with
these latter two outcomes.
Key Independent Variable: Adolescent Facial
Attractiveness
Our key independent variable is adolescent facial attractive-
ness, which is based on respondents' senior year yearbook
photographs. Yearbook photographs were rated by six male
and six female judges from approximately the same birth
cohort as WLS respondents. Judges rated photographs from
one ("not at all attractive") to eleven "extremely attrac-
tive" with the aid of gender-specific anchor photos. The
raw scores were then standardized in a series of steps that
included an adjustment for each judge (to rule out judge-
specific effects) and then averaging the scores and normal-
izing them to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of
one (for details see Scholz & Sicinski, 2015).
The WLS use of high school yearbook photographs dif-
fers substantially from many of the measures of attractive-
ness used by other studies, which include weight, height, and
survey interviewer ratings of respondent attractiveness. One
potential benefit of relying on facial attractiveness as opposed
to height or weight is that it may be assumed that being more
beautiful is beneficial for both men and women, whereas the
benefits of height or weight may vary according to gender
(Fikkan & Rothblum, 2012; Harper, 2000). Perceptions of
facial attractiveness are associated with three characteristics
(Rhodes, 2006). Symmetrical features are preferred to asym-
metrical ones. More average faces--in terms of similarity to
the traits of the relevant population--are perceived as more
attractive than distinctive faces. Faces that feature classic
representations of notions about masculinity or femininity
(referred to as secondary sexual characteristics, or sexual
dimorphism) are also more highly valued. Attractiveness
is culturally and temporally specific, and the study's use of
raters from approximately the same birth cohort--the same
people respondents would encounter in marriage markets--
improves confidence that the measure of attractiveness used
is meaningful for our outcomes of interest.
Other Covariates of Interest
One advantage of the WLS is that it includes a rich array
of additional covariates that prior literature has identified
190 Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2017, Vol. 72, No. 1
as salient for intimate relationships in the later life course.
Of particular interest is gender (1 = female), given that prior
literature indicates that men are more likely to be sexu-
ally active in and out of relationships and more likely to
be partnered in later life. Other measures include family
background (a factor-weighted composite parental socio-
economic status measure incorporating parental education,
income, and father's educational prestige; and dichotomous
indicators of city background and farm background), which
may be associated with factors such as teeth straightening
and good nutrition that are linked to attractiveness; edu-
cation (high school only [reference], some college, college
or more education); marital status (married [reference],
divorced, widowed, never married); physical health (self-
rated health, count of chronic conditions, indicator that
health limits moderate physical activities, body mass index
[BMI]); net worth; extraversion, neuroticism, and self-
acceptance. We code net worth as indicators for quintiles
of the distribution of the 2004 imputed variable supplied
by WLS. BMI is a categorical variable based on standard
cutoffs (BMI < 18.5, underweight; 18.5  BMI < 25, nor-
mal weight [reference]; 25  BMI < 30, overweight; BMI 
30, obese). Finally, when modeling sexual activity among
married people, we also include indicators of marital dura-
tion in years and marital satisfaction. An examination of
local linear regression models of the probability of sexual
activity across marital duration revealed a nonlinear rela-
tionship between duration and sexual activity. As such, we
model marital duration with splines. Based on local linear
regression model results, we include spline knots at 6 years
and 20 years.We measure marital satisfaction using a phone
survey item asking about closeness to the current spouse,
with answers ranging from"not at all close"to"very close".
Analytic Strategy
We use binary logistic or multinomial logistic regression
models appropriate to the particular outcome of interest.
Results are presented as odds or relative risk ratios. We
focus on attractiveness coefficients, as well as how these
change with the inclusion of additional covariates. We also
conducted supplementary analyses in which we included
interactions between attractiveness and gender. In general,
these interactions were not statistically significant (avail-
able upon request).
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics. At age 64, 66% of
the overall sample--and 81% of married respondents--are
sexually active.Approximately 20% of unmarried respond-
ents (4% of the total sample) have a sexual partner. Levels
of sexual activity and sexual partnership among the unmar-
ried declined by age 71 (available upon request).
Table 2 displays results from logistic regression models
predicting the likelihood of being sexually active among
all respondents. Adolescent attractiveness is positively
associated with being sexually active and is completely
explained by marital status. Across models, divorced, wid-
owed, and never married persons are all far less likely to be
sexually active compared with currently married persons.
Controlling for all other covariates, good self-rated health
is positively associated with sexual activity and obese or
overweight persons are less likely to be sexually active com-
pared with normal weight persons. In the full model, high
net worth (top quintile and fourth quintilevs bottom quin-
tile) is positively associated with sexual activity as is self-
acceptance. Extraversion and neuroticism are not related
to sexual activity. Women are far less likely to be sexually
active than men across models.
As Table 2 indicates the importance of attractiveness
in facilitating sexual activity via the availability of partner
via marriage, Table 3 further examines how attractiveness
matters to access to a (potential) sexual partner. We focus
on results for unmarried persons with a sexual partner ver-
sus without, as results for the married versus unmarried
without a sexual partner may reflect reverse causality (e.g.,
higher net worth may either select individuals into marriage
and/or marriage may generate higher net worth). In the full
model, we find that unmarried persons rated more attrac-
tive as adolescents are more likely to have a sexual part-
ner. Among unmarried people, women and obese persons
are less likely to have a sexual partner, whereas individu-
als with high net worth, greater extraversion, and greater
neuroticism are more likely to have a sexual partner. Given
increases in remarriage in later life, we also examined
whether adolescent attractiveness predicted remarriage by
age 64. In our sample, we find that 21% of those who were
divorced or widowed in 1992 were remarried in 2004.
However, we found that adolescent attractiveness was not
related to remarriage in later life (results not shown, avail-
able upon request).
Table 4 shows results from models predicting sexual
activity among married people at age 64. Attractiveness
is not associated with sexual activity within marriage,
whereas women are less likely to be sexually active across
models. We also identify a "honeymoon effect," in which
the odds of sexual activity drop rather quickly in the first
few years of marriage and then decline much more slowly.
At about 20 years of marriage, marital sexual activity flat-
tens out, and even appears to rise gradually subsequently.
Further, marital closeness is positively associated with
sexual activity. People with worse health have lower odds
of sexual activity in the full model. Compared with those
who are normal weight, overweight or obese married
persons are less likely to be sexually active. Net worth
is strongly and positively associated with sexual activity
as is self-acceptance. We also considered whether adoles-
cent attractiveness was related to quality of sexual rela-
tionships measured as either reported physical pleasure
or emotional satisfaction within marital sexual relation-
ships. Attractiveness did not have a statistically significant
191

relationship with either measure at either age 64 or 71
(results available upon request).
Discussion
Even as a growing body of research provides insights into
the importance of attractiveness in young and middle
adulthood for intimate relationships, we know relatively
little about how attractiveness earlier in life may influ-
ence intimate relationships later in life. This article offers
the most comprehensive attempt to address this question.
We find that attractiveness matters largely by providing
access to sexual partners, for both married and unmarried
individuals. We find that more attractive adolescents have
greater sexual activity later in life and that this relationship
is completely mediated by marital status. The results there-
fore point to the importance of attractiveness in facilitating
access to a sexual partner via marriage. Turning to our sec-
ond outcome of (potential) sexual partner availability, we
also found evidence that more attractive adolescents are
also more likely to have access to sexual partners among
the unmarried at older ages. We did not find, however, an
association between adolescent attractiveness and remar-
riage in later life. This suggests that attractiveness may vary
in its importance depending on whether someone is being
evaluated as "marriage material" or for a more casual rela-
tionship. Given that many marriages begin relatively early
in the life course (i.e., one's 20s or 30s), attractiveness is
linked to later life sexual activity in part through the estab-
lishment of partnerships (mostly marriage) sometimes dec-
ades in the past. However, adolescent attractiveness also
facilitates romantic relationships in later life, as evidenced
by our findings for the unmarried having a sexual partner
at age 64.

Even as attractiveness facilitates the finding of partners,
we found that attractiveness is not related to measures of
sexual activity among married couples--being sexually
active, physical pleasure, or emotional satisfaction. This
finding serves to reinforce the point that the primary ben-
efit of attractiveness in the context of intimate relationships
is facilitating some form of partnership. The finding may
also reflect the long duration of the majority of marriages
in the sample. Though we control for duration, physical
attractiveness may be most salient in the very beginning of
relationships or be important in initial attraction, rather
than in sustaining the relationship. As relationship duration
increases, initial sexual attraction, in which attractiveness is
an important component, may be a less critical determinant
of sexual activity, possibly supplanted by other factors such
as health. Given that intimate relationships are occurring
in increasingly diverse forms--dating, cohabitation, living
apart together, remarriage (e.g., Brown & Shinohara, 2013,
De Jong Gierveld, 2004)--future research should examine
variation in the determinants of sexual activity by specific
relationship context.
Consistent with prior findings, we find that women are
less likely to be married, less likely to be partnered if unmar-
ried, and less likely to be sexually active within marriage.
This reflects in part skewed sex ratios in which women
increasingly outnumber men (Karraker, DeLamater, &
Schwartz, 2011), and the differing spousal characteristics
of men and women of the same age, as women tend to part-
ner with men older than themselves, which are accentuated
further in remarriage markets (England & McClintock,
2009). These patterns yield large asymmetries not only the
chronological age, but also the health of same-aged wom-
en's and men's spouses, with women less likely to have a
healthy spouse.
Supplementary analysis revealed that the relationship
between attractiveness and intimate relationship outcomes
did not generally vary by gender in our sample. Some prior
studies have suggested that female facial attractiveness is
more important for men in heterosexual partnered activity.
However, this relationship may be age dependent. A recent
study (Marcinkowska, Dixson, Kozlov, & Rantala, 2015)
found that men's preference for facial femininity declines
with age, which may be related to concomitant declines
in testosterone. This finding may partially explain why we
do not see significant gender interactions between attrac-
tiveness and sexual activity outcomes in later life. Another
explanation may be the increasing salience of other fac-
tors--particularly health and economic resources--for
both men and women as they age. Further, as notions of
intimate relationships change over the life course (Calasanti
& Slevin, 2001), both women and men may prioritize emo-
tional intimacy over sexual intimacy (Lodge & Umberson,
2012). In addition, the relationship between gender and
attractiveness may depend on life course stage (i.e., repro-
ductive ages vs postreproductive ages), as well as how the
particular historical period shapes factors such as women's
economic status relative to men, which could generate
gender asymmetries in the value of beauty in marriage mar-
kets. Consistent with several other studies (e.g., DeLamater
& Sill, 2005; Karraker, DeLamater, & Schwartz, 2011;
Lindau et al., 2007; Vespa, 2012), we also find positive
associations between health, economic resources, and inti-
mate relationship outcomes. Health and financial resources
are both sought-after attributes in a mate (England &
McClintock, 2009).
We also observe associations between personality and
intimate relationship outcomes. People with higher self-
acceptance have greater sexual activity (overall and within
marriage) and sexual partnership among the unmarried,
suggesting that positive psychological well-being is ben-
eficial for sexual relationships regardless of partner context.
Extraversion is positively associated with unmarried respond-
ents reporting a sexual partner, but is not associated with sex-
ual activity within marriage or overall. This is not surprising
given that extraversion is an advantage in meeting new peo-
ple, including new potential sexual partners. In addition, neu-
roticism is positively associated with the unmarried having
a sexual partner, which may reflect that aspects of neuroti-
cism, especially combined with conscientiousness, are protec-
tive of health--itself a predictor of sexual activity (Turiano,
Mroczek, Moynihan, & Chapman, 2013). Neuroticism may
capture some efforts to maintain attractiveness in ways not
captured by health items (e.g., grooming, dressing; Flint,
2004). Collectively, these findings point to the roles that per-
sonality and other psychological factors may play in building
intimate relationships later in life, inviting additional research
to better understand how these factors matter.
Study Limitations
Like any study, there are some caveats to our findings. First,
our findings are based on a unique sample of predominantly
White individuals who graduated from Wisconsin high
schools in 1957, most of whom were born in 1939. As such,
our findings are specific to the experiences of this cohort and
are not nationally representative. However, we do note that
based on a comparison with similar individuals in NSHAP,
our sample resembles White Americans born around the
same time as WLS respondents with at least a high school
education (see Supplementary Material). Future research
should explore variation in the determinants of intimate
relationships by class, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
other factors (Calasanti & Slevin, 2001). Further, though we
generally do not find differences between results for age 64
and age 71 (results for the latter available upon request), we
do note that any differences in findings between ages might
also be interpreted as period effects rather than age effects.
In addition, like prior studies of sexual behavior (e.g., Call,
Sprecher, & Schwartz, 1995), some individuals refused ques-
tions about sexual activity. In supplementary analysis, we
found that women who were widowed and never married
were more likely to refuse to answer the sexual frequency
question compared with men and the currently married.
Adolescent attractiveness, however, was not associated with
197
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2017, Vol. 72, No. 1
refusals, suggesting that our sexual activity results may be
biased with respect to gender and marital status but that
our estimates of the association between attractiveness and
outcomes suffer from little bias.
Another caveat to our study is the vague measure of
"sex" used in the survey instrument. To the extent that
respondents may have different conceptualizations of
"sex" we may either over- or underestimate sexual activ-
ity. We also are unable to model many characteristics of
spouses in the case of partnered sexual activity--including
attractiveness. Future work should explore how spousal
similarities (via assortative mating and/or shared environ-
ments--including those related to factors such as body
weight) and differences (e.g., health mismatches) impact
partnered sexual activity. Finally, we do not have good
measures of attractiveness in later life, precluding an
examination of the direct role of attractiveness in later
life. Despite these limitations, the present study docu-
ments the importance of adolescent attractiveness in the
