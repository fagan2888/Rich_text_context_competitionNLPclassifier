Although the need for differentiated educational experiences
for gifted students is well documented (e.g., Renzulli &
Smith, 1979; Robinson, 1990; Tomlinson, 1997; VanTassel-
Baska & Stambaugh, 2005), evidence indicates that differen-
tiation is inconsistently implemented (Archambault et al.,
1993; Moon, Tomlinson, & Callahan, 1995; VanTassel-
Baska & Stambaugh, 2005). Teachers who wish to differenti-
ate curriculum for high ability learners face barriers such as
the lack of planning time, the need to modify curriculum, and
the lack of training in meeting the academic needs of gifted
students. (Tomlinson, 1994, 1999; VanTassel-Baska &
Stambaugh, 2005; Westberg, Archambault, Dobyns, &
Salvin, 1993). Online tools have the potential to address
these barriers, enabling students of all ability levels and age
levels to find content that can challenge them at appropriate
levels. Classroom technology use has been linked to educa-
tional outcomes (Azzam, 2006; Bain & Ross, 2000; R.
Cradler & Cradler, 1999; J. Cradler, McNabb, Freeman, &
Burchett, 2002), but there has been almost no research on the
use of specific technology tools with gifted students.
The Renzulli Learning System (RLS) is an interactive
online program that matches student interests, learning
styles, and expression styles with a wide array of educa-
tional activities and resources that are designed to enrich
students' learning processes. Students using RLS have
opportunities to explore, discover, learn, and create using
current technology resources independently and in a pre-
screened web environment. This qualitative study describes
the use of RLS from the perspectives of gifted and talented
students who use the system to complete school projects.
This study may help to describe the efforts necessary to
increase gifted students' engagement at school through
online learning, to assist educators in planning for these stu-
dents, and in better understanding how these students like to
learn and prefer to work at school.
Literature Review
There is no single definition of giftedness or gifted learners.
The field of gifted education generally presents the belief
that gifted individuals are those who have abilities in one or
more domains that are sufficiently advanced as to require
modifications in educational settings established for average
students. For example, the federal definition of giftedness

"Just What I Need": Gifted Students'
Perceptions of One Online Learning
System

Abstract
Little research exists on the nature of the interactions between gifted students and technology, specifically the phenomenon
of gifted adolescents using Internet-based learning tools. This qualitative study explores how students use the Renzulli
Learning System (RLS), an online educational profile with a matching database that provides enrichment resources. The
student sample included nine identified gifted and talented seventh- and eighth-grade students in an urban school district
in Connecticut. Most of the students had been using RLS for about 2 years. The students participated in an electronic
questionnaire and were interviewed during two semistructured interviews. The research questions were centered on how
the students were using RLS at school. Student answers suggested several themes regarding the effectiveness of RLS as a tool
for school success, its engaging quality, and selective independence.

Renzulli, gifted, adolescent, online
2 SAGE Open
specifies a wide range of domains in which students could
demonstrate high levels of talent or show the potential for
such talent (U.S. Department of Education, 1993). While
earlier definitions of giftedness were based almost exclu-
sively on a general intelligence factor, often defined by IQ
(Galton, 1962; Terman, 1926), newer conceptions expand
that definition to other abilities and measures (e.g., Borland,
2003; Borland & Wright, 1994; Ford, 1998; Frasier et al.,
1995).
For the purpose of this study, another expanded opera-
tional definition of giftedness is used. Renzulli (1978)
defined gifted behaviors as the result of above-average abil-
ity, high levels of task commitment, and high levels of cre-
ativity combined and applied to any potentially valuable area
of human performance. Under this definition, gifted learners
are those who have the potential to demonstrate gifted behav-
iors in one or more areas, and the goal of gifted education
programs is to develop such behaviors. This is also the defi-
nition of giftedness underpinning the RLS.
Meeting the Academic Needs of Gifted Learners
Exceptionally capable students exhibit characteristics that
challenge the efficacy of the traditional American educa-
tional system (Karnes & Bean, 2001; Plucker & Callahan,
2008; Renzulli, Gubbins, McMillen, Eckert, & Little, 2009).
Those that demonstrate advanced ability in one or more aca-
demic areas may be poorly served by age-based placement
(Davis, 2006; Horowitz, Subotnik, & Matthews, 2009;
Tomlinson, 1999), and asynchronous development of abili-
ties may pose difficulties for strictly acceleration-based ser-
vices (Karnes & Bean, 2001; Kearney, 1996). Gifted students
may also differ from their peers in their preferred thinking
styles (Sternberg & Grigorenko, 1993) and in their ability to
make intuitive conceptual connections (Sak, 2004). The
Council for Exceptional Children (2002) stated that, to serve
gifted students appropriately, teachers should match their
instructional strategies to the specific learning needs of the
students and that the students should receive an appropri-
ately differentiated curriculum or have access to the full
range of curriculum (through distance education, accelera-
tion, or other specially designed programs).
There is disagreement within the field of gifted education
as to what would constitute the best curriculum and instruc-
tion for gifted students (e.g., Borland, 2003; Renzulli et al.,
2009). VanTassel-Baska and Brown (2007) identified six
curricular models that showed some evidence of being effec-
tive with gifted learners. These models generally involved
inquiry-based learning within academic disciplines or fields.
The Schoolwide Enrichment Model (SEM; Renzulli & Reis,
1997), which is based on Renzulli's (1978) definition of gift-
edness and in turn is the foundation for the design of RLS,
was one of the models with the longest history of use and
research. In the SEM, a talent pool of students with the
potential for gifted behaviors is identified through a variety
of measures (Renzulli, Reis, & Smith, 1981). Identified stu-
dents are then eligible for a continuum of services, including
differentiation based on assessed interests and learning
styles. Curriculum compacting also is used to eliminate
instruction in material already mastered and allows for sub-
stitute alternative learning activities (Reis, Burns, & Renzulli,
1992; Renzulli & Smith, 1979). A major goal of SEM is for
identified students to complete Type III projects: investiga-
tive activities and artistic productions in which the learner
assumes the role of a firsthand inquirer: thinking, feeling,
and acting like a practicing professional, with involvement
pursued at a level as advanced or professional as possible
(Renzulli, 1977). Research on the SEM has demonstrated
improved teacher attitudes toward student work as well as
long-term effects of Type III projects on students'later career
choices and productivity (Delcourt, 1994; Hébert, 1993;
VanTassel-Baska & Brown, 2007).
Barriers to Differentiation in the Regular
Classroom
Although there is a general consensus in the gifted education
literature that some form of differentiation is necessary to
meet gifted students'learning needs (Council for Exceptional
Children, 2002; Kearney, 1996; Levande, 1999; Renzulli &
Smith, 1979; Robinson, 1990; Tomlinson, 1994, 1997;
VanTassel-Baska & Stambaugh, 2005), and teachers may
agree that addressing academic differences is important for
success (Hootstein, 1998), differentiation has not been
implemented consistently. Researchers at the National
Research Center on the Gifted and Talented studied the
extent to which gifted students received differentiated
instruction in regular classrooms in the United States
(Archambault et al., 1993) and found that third- and fourth-
grade teachers made only minor modifications in the regular
curriculum to meet the needs of the gifted students, regard-
less of whether they taught in public or private schools or the
location and ethnic diversity of the school. Moon et al. (1995)
found that 50% of the teachers they surveyed did not differ-
entiate instruction. VanTassel-Baska and Stambaugh (2005)
noted that the pattern of research findings stayed consistent
for over a decade. As a result, gifted students are often not
challenged in the classroom (Tomlinson, 1997), and they
often spend much of the day tutoring others in cooperative
learning groups or reviewing curriculum that they mastered
years ago on their own (Robinson, 1990; U.S. Department of
Education, 1993).
Several reasons for the lack of differentiation for gifted
students have been identified. Structural reasons include too
little planning time, lack of administrative support, large
class sizes, and pressure to focus on low-achieving students
(National Association for Gifted Children, n.d.; Tomlinson,
1994, 1999; VanTassel-Baska & Stambaugh, 2005). Teachers
may be unclear about their professed beliefs regarding indi-
vidual differences, perceive no need to differentiate for
Swicord et al. 3
advanced learners, or even hold negative attitudes toward
gifted students (Borland, 1978; Knapp, 2012; Lortie, 1975;
Moon et al., 1995; Robinson, 1990; VanTassel-Baska &
Stambaugh, 2005; Winner, 1996). Finally, there are obstacles
related to teacher knowledge and skills. Teachers may receive
very little training in the needs of gifted students, be unable
to manage effectively a differentiated classroom, have insuf-
ficient subject matter knowledge for in-depth explorations,
or be uncomfortable modifying a predesigned curriculum
(Stigler & Hiebert, 1999; Tomlinson, 1994, 1999; VanTassel-
Baska & Stambaugh, 2005; Westberg et al., 1993). Some of
these obstacles may be addressed through professional
development (Hultgren & Seeley, 1982; Reis & Westberg,
1994; Reis et al., 1993), but others could benefit from mak-
ing additional tools available to teachers.
Meeting Gifted Learners' Needs Through
Technology
Individualized learning via the Internet holds promise as stu-
dents pursue study based on interests and skills rather than
on age (Anderson, 2004; J. Cradler et al., 2002; Field, 2009;
Leu, Leu, & Coiro, 2004; Renzulli & Reis, 2007; Sheffield,
2007). Students already use the Internet and other technol-
ogy for a variety of purposes. In 2005, children ages 8 to 18
typically spent approximately 8.5 hr each day using media;
2 hr of that time was spent using multiple media and more
than 1 hr was spent using a computer (Roberts, Foehr, &
Rideout, 2005). Furthermore, a 2005 Pew Study reported
that 87% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 used the Internet, and
half of those used it daily (Lenhart, Hitlin, & Madden, 2005).
Students who use the Internet at home are frustrated because
they cannot use technology how, when, and where they want
in their classes (Project Tomorrow, 2006), and they believe
that technology can enrich their learning experience (Lenhart
et al., 2005; Project Tomorrow, 2006; Sheffield, 2007).
Schools' technology infrastructure is also growing. By June
of 2000, more than 95% of U.S. schools and 72% of class-
rooms had access to online Internet technology (CEO Forum
on Education & Technology, 2000). According to Azzam
(2006), more than half of teachers use technology in their
classroom instruction.
Research has linked technology and educational attain-
ment in U.S. classrooms. For example, Bain and Ross (2000)
found that careful alignment between content-area learning
standards and carefully selected technology can significantly
increase student achievement scores. When evaluating the
results of a school system's technology grant, R. Cradler and
Cradler (1999) reported that teachers observed significant
changes in their students' skills and knowledge acquisition
upon completion of their first multimedia project. In a fol-
low-up study, "teachers reported increased student knowl-
edge in: research skills; ability to apply learning toward
real- world situations; organizational skills; and interest in
content" (J. Cradler et al., 2002, p. 47), suggesting that
engagement in technology results in positive gains, measur-
able and assumed. However, little research has explicitly
focused on gifted students' learning through technology.
Anderson (2004) identified four capacities of online media
that are important to gifted students in that they allow gifted
students to have autonomy in their learning: flexibility of
time and place of learning, vast quantities of content, varied
formats of content, and rich contexts of synchronous and
asynchronous communication. This study explores gifted
students' use of a particular online system (RLS) that pos-
sesses these capacities and addresses some of the barriers to
differentiation listed in the previous section.
Method
In this study, qualitative procedures were used to investigate
the phenomenon of engagement in gifted adolescents. The
focus of this basic, interpretative qualitative study was devel-
oping an understanding of students' interpretations of work-
ing with RLS and the meaning that "attributed to their
experiences" (Merriam, 2009, p. 23) with RLS. The informa-
tion gathered from the students enabled a first step to under-
standing how students engage and react to participation in an
online learning system.
The central question of this study was related to gifted
adolescent students and their engagement with an online
enrichment program called the RLS. The following research
questions guided this study:
Research Question 1: How are the selected adolescents
using RLS?
Research Question 2: What are the perceived effects of
using RLS on school behaviors?
Nine middle school students in Grades 7 and 8 were
selected to participate in this study. These students attended
a public school in an urban district in Connecticut, had been
identified for the school district's gifted program, and were
currently using RLS. The students' gifted teacher selected
the students based on a set of researcher-created criteria,
including usage of RLS, participation in the gifted program,
and exhibiting a range of school behaviors indicative of
engagement in the regular core curriculum.
The selected public school system has about 23,000 stu-
dents, one of the largest school systems in Connecticut. The
per capita income for this district was US$16,306 in 2000. In
2005-2006, more than 95% of the students were eligible for
free or reduced lunch, as compared with the state average of
26.9%. The district is diverse in race and ethnicity with a
90% minority rate in 2005-2006, and this district is far below
the state average on Connecticut's Mastery Test. The K-8
school visited in this study is in the largest city in the state
with a population of 140,000. The gifted program occupies a
room in a trailer behind the school, along with two other
classrooms.
4 SAGE Open
The students were identified for the gifted program on the
basis of teacher recommendation, academic and effort
grades, Connecticut Mastery Test scores, and online quar-
terly assessments. Students met as a team with the gifted pro-
gram teacher 1 day per week and attended regular classes the
remaining 4 days per week. Transportation to one of the two
schools with gifted programs was provided for all of the dis-
trict's identified students. A child was required to meet aca-
demic and behavioral standards to remain in the gifted
program.
Students involved in the study ranged in age from 12 to
14 (four eighth graders and five seventh graders). Of the
nine students, three were male and six were female. Among
the eighth graders, the genders were evenly split. There
were four females and one male in the seventh-grade group.
(see Table 1.)
RLS
The RLS was designed to assist teachers with differentiating
or individualizing assignments for students based on inter-
ests, learning styles, and expression styles. The program
focuses on understanding what each student's interests,
learning styles, and expression styles are and then providing
a list of thousands of activities and assignments that the stu-
dent can engage in that reflect the student's individual needs
and preferences. The program is student centered and focuses
on the development of a product. When students first log in
to RLS, they are given a questionnaire that identifies the stu-
dents' top 3 interests, top 3 learning styles, and top 3 expres-
sion styles. Based on that information, a profile is developed
and a list of educational resources (from over 400,000
screened resources) is populated to match each student's pro-
file. Teachers can then guide students through self-directed
learning projects or assignments utilizing sources from the
student's personalized list of educational resources.
Data Collection
Data was collected through an online questionnaire and in-
depth interviews with selected students, using a semistructured
protocol. Each participant completed an electronic ques-
tionnaire (Appendix A) before being interviewed. The
responses to the questionnaire helped the first author assess
the appropriateness of the interview questions, and pro-
vided primary data directly from the hands of the partici-
pants. An interview then was conducted in school during 1
week, and subsequent interviews were conducted within 2
weeks following the first interviews. Student quotes used
in this discussion derive from the interviews.
The first interview (Appendix B) established a base for
understanding and established trust. The second interview
enabled elaboration of comments and questions addressed in
the first interview and sought the participants' checks on the
first interview through specific questions (i.e., What did you
mean when you said . . .?"). The interviews, lasting from
30 min to 45 min were taped and transcribed as soon as pos-
sible following the interview. The first author took notes on
the students' responses in addition to relying on the tapes.
The interviews took place in an empty classroom in the
school. The first author continuously rephrased the students'
responses and asked if she was conveying the meaning that
they intended. All students agreed that the rephrasing was
accurate, indicating that the researcher had accurately inter-
preted their answers.
Data Analysis
When reviewing the data gathered in answer to the research
questions, the first author noted recurring themes that
emerged. The initial open codes were developed based on
participant responses to the questionnaires, and to notes
from the interviews (Creswell, 2007). Once the interviews
were transcribed, the first author indicated which text seg-
ments represented the open codes. After an analysis of all
the transcribed interviews the first author developed ana-
lytic codes (Creswell, 2007) pertaining to the research
questions and occurring across most of the participants.
The following three codes were developed into three of the
major themes:
1. RLS is a desirable tool for getting good grades;
2. RLS is for school use only, not for beyond school
assignments;
3. RLS is enjoyable.
For example, Mark's statement, "I really don't use other pro-
grams because rls gives me all the information that I need"
was coded as "RLS is a desirable tool for getting good
grades."
Validity
Researcher effects were checked by having two others
(a psychologist who has worked in the field of gifted educa-
tion and a master teacher of urban gifted children working

in a context similar to the sample) review the study and
findings. Both readers concurred that the findings were
consistent with their experiences working with similar stu-
dents in similar situations.
Finally, the first author's orientation to RLS was impor-
tant in contributing to the study's trustworthiness. The
researcher believes that RLS is an effective way to enhance
and enrich learning for gifted students. With that understand-
ing, the researcher reflected on the transcripts and observa-
tions to put aside as much bias as possible in understanding
and describing the phenomenon.
Results
Three major themes emerged from the data gathered through
the research questions. One additional finding emerged from
the content of student comments.
Theme 1: RLS is a Useful
Tool for Attaining Good Grades
The first, most dominant theme emerged from students' per-
ceptions of need and desire to attain high grades, and the use
of RLS as a vehicle to achieve very good grades. These stu-
dents very much wanted to have tools at their disposal that
made it easy and likely that they would be successful in
school. Cindy thought it made her more organized, which
helped her get better grades. "I can separate my topics within
my project. Instead of one pile of information I can be orga-
nized and get better information." Mark also liked that "it has
research that you want and not what you don't need." He
added that RLS was "easier to use than wide-based databases
because they have a whole bunch of things but Renzulli cat-
egorizes what you need."
In addition to the assistance that RLS provided for them in
their projects, students noted that they gained general knowl-
edge as well, which helped them be more successful in
school. Cheryl believed she had gained keyboarding skills
from reading all the projects and that she was "way more
knowledgeable than before RLS. I've gained so much knowl-
edge even with the assignments that are given." Jamil thought
that using RLS had improved his work ethic and helped him
focus academically. "I work harder on schoolwork now and I
have better products." He ended one interview by stating,
"Renzulli is great!"
Theme 2: RLS is Just for School
The second notable theme that emerged focused on how stu-
dents viewed RLS as a school program, not for personal use
at home. It did not appear to have much relevance or exten-
sion into their lives beyond school other than homework. As
Alicia put it, "everything in Renzulli is about school. All the
topics you should learn in school are in there." Dari agreed.
"School is about learning new things and that's what Renzulli
does. We learn about other cultures and traditions and that's
what school does too so it's like a bonus for me." Hayley
confirmed the school connection but admitted the potential
for other benefits with this comment: "it's still doing work
but it's more helpful to the student."
Theme 3: Enjoyment and Fun
The third theme that became clear was that the students
regarded RLS as adding an element of fun to schoolwork.
They all enjoyed doing hands-on activities within the
sites. Each was able to recall a few activities and a few
projects. Cindy remembered doing projects on Amistad
and WWII, and she was able to recall deducing from her
Shakespeare project on whether Shakespeare was actually
the author of his plays. Rahul, whose favorite class is
geography, did a project on Argentina. Dari recalled creat-
ing her own tie-dye T-shirt while doing a study of the
1960s and also learning about a country in South America.
Cindy thought online learning "is funner [sic] to learn
because you know what you are looking for, you're inter-
ested and it's usually good information that will help you
in the future."
Theme Four: The Independence Paradox
Another finding that was notable, partly so because it
appeared contradictory, was that though these students pre-
ferred to try to achieve independently they also made com-
ments about the need to be networked, to have friends in the
right places, and to work together beyond the school experi-
ence. They essentially wanted to have a support group they
could depend on, but only when they needed it.
Naomi embraced the independence she gained through
RLS:
I used to be completely dependent on the teacher and if the
teacher didn't say it, I'm not going to do it. Your wish is my
command. Renzulli gives me more independence because
you use your imagination and knowledge to do what you're
doing.
But later, she alluded to the potential need for a helping
hand. "I think having a lot of friends is really helpful. They
all have their own different ways of helping you out."
Discussion
RLS appeared to be regarded as a tool for achieving an end,
the end being to get good grades. The students saw RLS as an
easy and efficient way to help them get good grades, which
was for them evidence of success in school and in life. They
liked using RLS because it did help them complete school
projects with a high level of quality. As with the teacher
6 SAGE Open
comments in the J. Cradler et al. (2002) study on the use of
multimedia projects, students in this study reported increased
ability in research and organizational skills.
Students in this study indicated that they were able to
work on individualized interest projects, a positive change
from findings pointing to a lack of differentiation in most
classrooms (Archambault et al., 1993; Moon et al., 1995;
VanTassel-Baska & Stambaugh, 2005). Students fondly
recalled a diverse number of research topics pursued
through the use of RLS including projects focused on the
geography of Argentina, events in the 1960s, and ques-
tions of authorship for the works credited to Shakespeare.
The personalized list of electronic resources provided by
RLS enabled students to pursue in-depth projects on top-
ics of interest in an organized and efficient manner with-
out the teacher needing to have in-depth knowledge of
each of the topics or go searching for quality resources for
each topic.
RLS provides two of the four aspects of online learning
that Anderson (2004) identified as important for gifted stu-
dents: a large quantity of resources and varied formats of
resources. Students not only appreciated the wide variety
of resources, but also appreciated that the resources were of
high quality, enabling them to complete projects in a more
efficient manner. Students often reflected that the resources
were just what they needed and that the format of RLS
enabled them to organize their findings. However, Anderson
also stated that gifted students appreciate flexibility with
time and place to complete assignments; but students in this
study tended to only work on RLS projects while at the gifted
program site, and not at home.
These gifted students' involvement with RLS can also be
described in terms of what was not the case. They did not
seem to see it influencing aspects of their lives beyond
school, did not use it very often for fun outside of school
projects or simply to learn about topics unrelated to school
assignments.
The results of this study are limited to the sample used
for the study. The themes of this study are based on the
responses of nine adolescent students in an urban, midsized
New England city in 2009. In addition, these results are
based on the perceptions of students identified for and par-
ticipating in a program for gifted and talented seventh- and
eighth-grade students. Furthermore, data was gathered over
a short period of time at the end of a school year by one
researcher. Finally, interpretations are limited to the kinds
of data available to the researcher, which were students'
written and oral responses to written and oral questions,
informal observations at the school, and informal discus-
sions with the gifted program teacher and district director
of evaluation. However, most of the information and result-
ing interpretations of data were fairly straightforward and
consistent with the literature. All these considerations
should be taken into account when attributing any stated
results to other groups or ages.
Conclusion
Teachers and administrators need to know how and why stu-
dents work within a program such as RLS if such programs
or their characteristics are to be replicated, refined, and
improved.
This study demonstrated how gifted adolescents per-
ceived one online learning system to be helpful in achieving
good grades and enjoying the learning process at school. The
themes and implications that emanated from this study sug-
gest some recommendations that educators and school
administrators should consider in enhancing their own ven-
ues for gifted students, whether at the individual, class,
school, or district levels. For an online learning system to be
used extensively by gifted students, students need to be
encouraged by gifted program teachers and regular class-
room teachers to use the program. In addition, some gifted
students need to be encouraged to view the learning process
as a lifelong endeavor.
In this technological age, there are many ways that schools
can employ tools and strategies to deal with the individual
needs that students bring to school. This study examined one
tool, the RLS, which students found to be beneficial. Teachers
can benefit from any tool that assists them in meeting the
broad range of abilities, interests, and performance levels in
today's classrooms. School administrators have an opportu-
nity to provide teachers with ongoing professional training,
to establish peer support in using new tools, and to encourage
teachers to be creative in their incorporation of new strate-
gies and tools with an emphasis on meeting the needs of
gifted and talented students. Online learning, such as RLS, is
still a rich area for future research. For example, how can
teachers use RLS to individualize the core curriculum for
gifted students in all their classes? Why do adolescent stu-
dents see a tool like RLS as strictly a "school only" tool,
especially when it is accessible from home and elsewhere? It
is likely that the reader may discern additional potential areas
for future study as well.
Finally, there is great promise in the students themselves.
These students clearly appreciated a good tool that helps
them and is enjoyable. They also wanted to succeed and had
very positive images of themselves and their future suc-
cesses. Educators and others should be inspired by the
strengths and ambitions of these young people as they enter
into their young adult lives, striving to be the best they can
be, using the resources available to them. Hopefully, the suc-
cesses described here within the context of the phenomenon
of the RLS are an inspiration to all educators as they continue
to find and create resources that will stimulate, organize, and
challenge young gifted minds.
