Self-doubt is a metacognition about ability. Specifically, it
can be considered the metacognitive representation of uncer-
tainty about one's abilities. Self-doubt has been shown to
have many negative impacts, for example, the negative cor-
relation between self-doubt and self-esteem (e.g., Hermann,
Leonardelli, & Arkin, 2002; Wichman & Hermann, 2010)
and the link between self-doubt and maladaptive coping
strategies such as self-handicapping and subjective over-
achievement (e.g., Jones & Berglas, 1978; Oleson,
Poehlmann, Yost, Lynch, & Arkin, 2000). We investigated
whether people respond to self-doubt differently, depending
on yet another metacognition about ability, namely, their
metacognition about the malleability of ability. We hypothe-
sized that the belief that ability was malleable, commonly
known as implicit incremental beliefs of ability (e.g., Dweck,
1999; Dweck & Leggett, 1988), might ameliorate the nega-
tive effects of self-doubt.
Self-Doubt
Most people experience self-doubt at times, but some indi-
viduals may experience chronic doubt about their compe-
tence and routinely feel distress about upcoming
performance. If perception of self-worth is contingent upon
competence or ability, self-doubt can become damaging to
self-esteem (Wichman & Hermann, 2010). Indeed, self-
doubt is negatively correlated with self-esteem, with
correlations ranging from -.44 to -.68 (Oleson et al., 2000).
Self-doubt is not the same as low self-efficacy. Self-efficacy
is a strong personal belief that one can successfully perform
in a specific domain (Bandura, 1997). Self-efficacy scales
assess how certain people are that they can do a particular
task (cannot do at all to highly certain (one) can do;
Bandura, 1997). Self-doubt, however, reflects one's feeling
of uncertainty about competence that may reach beyond a
specific sense of performance efficacy. The self-doubt scale
(Oleson et al., 2000) includes such representative items as
"More often than not I feel unsure of my abilities" and
"Sometimes I feel that I don't know why I have succeeded
at something." Thus, people can have high self-efficacy
(e.g., I believe I can perform the task) and yet still harbor
self-doubt (e.g., but I am not sure my ability is high in this
area. My high performance may just be due to high effort).
Research suggests that individuals use different types of
coping strategies to deal with chronic self-doubt. Self-
handicapping and subjective overachievement (Braslow,
Guerrettaz, Arkin, & Oleson, 2012; Jones & Berglas, 1978;
Oleson et al., 2000) are two of the most notable

Incremental Beliefs About Ability
Ameliorate Self-Doubt Effects
Qin Zhao1 and Aaron Wichman1
Abstract
Past research has typically shown negative effects of self-doubt on performance and psychological well-being. We suggest that
these self-doubt effects largely may be due to an underlying assumption that ability is innate and fixed. The present research
investigated the main hypothesis that incremental beliefs about ability might ameliorate negative effects of self-doubt. We
examined our hypotheses using two lab tasks: verbal reasoning and anagram tasks. Participants' self-doubt was measured and
beliefs about ability were measured after participants read articles advocating either for incremental or entity theories of
ability. American College Testing (ACT) scores were obtained to index actual ability level. Consistent with our hypothesis,
for participants who believed ability was relatively fixed, higher self-doubt was associated with increased negative affect and
lower task performance and engagement. In contrast, for participants who believed that ability was malleable, negative self-
doubt effects were ameliorated; self-doubt was even associated with better task performance. These effects were further
moderated by participants' academic ability. These findings suggest that mind-sets about ability moderate self-doubt effects.
Self-doubt may have negative effects only when it is interpreted as signaling that ability is immutably low.

coping strategies. Self-handicapping involves behaving (or
claiming to behave) in ways that undermine one's own per-
formance to obscure the link between ability and perfor-
mance (Arkin & Baumgardner, 1985; Jones & Berglas,
1978; Urdan & Midgley, 2001). For example, they may
avoid working on a presentation so that they can attribute
their poor performance to factors such as underpreparedness
rather than to low ability. Subjective overachievement as a
self-doubt coping strategy entails expending an extraordi-
nary amount of effort to achieve high performance (Jones &
Berglas, 1978; Oleson et al., 2000). However, this high
effort expenditure makes it difficult to attribute high perfor-
mance to high ability, instead of effort.
Beliefs About Ability
Something related to self-doubt that surprisingly has not
beenheavilyresearchedisincrementalbeliefsaboutability--
beliefs as to the extent to which ability is viewed as mal-
leable (Dweck, 1999; Dweck & Leggett, 1988). The self-
doubt literature implies that the negative consequences of
self-doubt arise when people believe that ability is relatively
fixed and stable. For instance, self-handicapping occurs
when people believe it is better to withdraw effect and fail to
avoid admitting low competence. Overachievement as a
negative consequence of self-doubt similarly implies beliefs
in ability as a fixed construct. Those who overachieve
remain high in self-doubt in spite of their extreme effort
investments; logically, if they had incremental beliefs, high
effort should eventually translate into reduced self-doubt.
What if high self-doubters believed that ability was mallea-
ble? Instead of self-handicapping or overachieving, self-
doubters who hold incremental beliefs about ability might
show both positive performance and psychological well-
being outcomes.
Implicit beliefs about ability have been studied in a vari-
ety of domains. According to Dweck (e.g., Dweck, 1999;
Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Hong, Chiu, Dweck, Lin, & Wan,
1999; Molden & Dweck, 2006), some individuals hold the
belief that ability is largely malleable and develops incre-
mentally through effort (incremental belief); whereas others
believe that ability is a fixed and stable entity (entity belief).
Individuals with incremental as opposed to entity beliefs dif-
fer in motivational orientation and behavioral pattern.
Incremental beliefs tend to motivate people to learn and to
develop their abilities. Students with incremental beliefs are
more willing to take on challenging tasks and persist on them
(Dweck, 1999, 2006). In contrast, entity beliefs motivate
people defensively to maintain a positive self-view of ability.
Students with entity beliefs tend to avoid challenges and to
seek tasks that will prove that they are smart (Dweck, 1999,
2006). Moreover, people with incremental beliefs put forth
more effort on a task after receiving negative feedback,
whereas those with entity beliefs tend to disengage from a
task after receiving negative feedback (e.g., Dweck &
Leggett, 1988; Hong et al., 1999). A recent review also dem-
onstrates that students with incremental beliefs about ability
show higher academic achievement across challenging
school transitions and greater completion rates in challeng-
ing courses (see Yeager & Dweck, 2012). It is important to
note that these beliefs about ability vary on a continuum and
change dynamically based on environmental influences (e.g.,
Kurtz-Costes, McCall, Kinlaw, Wiesen, & Joyner, 2005).
The existing research on self-doubt and beliefs about abil-
ity is sparse. Reich and Arkin (2006) found that participants
who believed that their evaluators held an entity belief about
ability reported greater self-doubt about their upcoming test
performance when they expected to do poorly but less self-
doubt when they expected to do well, compared with their
counterparts who expected incremental evaluators. However,
these findings were about what self-doubters thought others
believed, not about the self-doubters' own implicit beliefs.
More relevant to the current research, Wichman and Hermann
(2010) were able to show a mediating effect of entity beliefs
about ability in the relationship between self-doubt and self-
handicapping (in a sample of more than 1,000 people). There
is also evidence that compared with low self-handicappers,
high self-handicappers are more likely to have entity beliefs
of ability (Ommundsen, 2001; Rhodewalt, 1994).
Present Research
Any variable can serve multiple roles (e.g., Tormala, Brinol,
& Petty, 2007). Although the prior work investigated beliefs
about ability as a mediator between self-doubt and maladap-
tive coping, the focus of the present study was to examine the
interaction between beliefs about ability and self-doubt, that
is, beliefs about ability as a moderator of the relationship
between self-doubt and related outcomes. We hypothesized
that incremental beliefs about ability should diminish the
negative effects of self-doubt. Specifically, we expected that
when people believe that ability was fixed, high self-doubt
should yield lower levels of well-being, lower task engage-
ment, and lower performance, compared with low self-doubt.
However, when people believe that ability was malleable,
the difference between high and low self-doubt individuals
should be reduced.
To examine this idea, after collecting self-doubt scores,
we exposed the participants to a manipulation of their beliefs
about ability and then measured their ability beliefs, fol-
lowed by our dependent measures. Measured ability beliefs
were used to predict the main dependent variables. These
included measures of task performance, task engagement,
and psychological well-being. American College Testing
(ACT) scores (the ACT is a standardized college admission
test in the United States) were obtained to represent actual
ability level. Research on implicit theories shows that often,
the effects of these theories are most pronounced under dif-
ficult conditions, such as following a poor performance
(Pollack, Burnette, & Hoyt, 2012), ego-depleting task (Job,
Zhao and Wichman 3
Dweck, & Walton, 2010), or, most relevant here, under con-
ditions where people perceive that they have low compe-
tence (Ommundsen, 2001). We expected that low-ACT
individuals might have greater difficulty with our experi-
mental tasks, and thus show most clearly the effects of
implicit theories moderating self-doubt effects.
Method
Participants and Design
One hundred university students (64 female) enrolled in
introductory psychology classes participated in the study for
partial fulfillment of their class requirement. Participants'
ages ranged from 18 to 47 years (M = 19.6 years). Participants
were native English speakers and received partial course
credit for their participation. They were randomly assigned
to either incremental or entity beliefs conditions.
Procedure
All sessions were conducted on computers using MediaLab
2012 software. After receiving instructions, participants
completed the self-doubt scale (Oleson et al., 2000), an
eight-item measure ( = .82). Some example items are
"More often than not I feel unsure of my abilities" and "As
I begin an important task, I usually feel confident in my
abilities (reverse scored)." Participants rated their level of
agreement with each statement from 1 (disagree very much)
to 6 (agree very much).
Next, they started a "reading comprehension" task, which
was actually the manipulation of incremental or entity inter-
pretations of ability, as used by Miele and Molden (2010).
The article was named "The Origins of Intelligence: Is the
Nature-Nurture Controversy Resolved?" The article was fic-
titious and appeared as a publication in the November 2007
issue of Psychology Today. The incremental and entity ver-
sions describe scientific "evidence" that supported the idea
that intelligence/ability is environmentally determined and
can be improved over time, or that intelligence is genetically
determined and remains stable over time. After the article,
participants responded to three open-ended items (Miele &
Molden, 2010) to increase the impact of the article.
Specifically, they (a) briefly summarized the main point, (b)
described the evidence that they found most convincing, and
(c) described an example from their own experience that fit
with the main point of the article. Participants then com-
pleted an eight-item Personalized Measure of Theories of
Intelligence (De Castella & Bryne, 2015), which was devel-
oped based on the Ideas About Intelligence Questionnaire by
Dweck (1999). Instead of general implicit theories about
abilities, this personalized measure ( = .80) assesses stu-
dents' personal theories about their own abilities. Personal
beliefs tend to be powerful predictors of motivation and per-
formance (Bandura, 1997). Two example items are: "I
believe I can always substantially improve on my intelli-
gence" and "I don't think I personally can do much to
increase my intelligence" (reverse scored). Participants
reported their level of agreement with each statement on a 1
(disagree very much) to 6 (agree very much) scale.
Participants then completed three measures of psycho-
logical well-being. The first measure was the Positive and
Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &
Tellegan, 1988). The PANAS ( = .84) consists of a number
of words that describe different feelings and emotions such
as "distressed" and "proud." Participants were asked to read
each item and indicate to what extent from 1 (not at all) to 5
(extremely) they felt this way right now. The second measure
was the Performance Self-Esteem subscale of the State Self-
Esteem Questionnaire (also called the Current Thought
Scale; Heatherton & Polivy, 1991). This 7-item question-
naire ( =.89) consists of statements such as "I feel as smart
as others" and "I feel frustrated about my performance."
Participants indicated their level of agreement with each
statement from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The third mea-
sure was a 20-item task anxiety questionnaire adapted from
the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI; Spielberger et al., 1980).
Before participants responded to this questionnaire, they
were given sample items from the reasoning tasks that would
be used to measure their objective performance (see
Appendix A) and told that they would be completing similar
problems. An example item on the questionnaire ( = .91) is
"I feel very panicky about the upcoming tasks." Participants
rated to what extent they agreed with each statement out of a
4-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much so).
Participants then started on the randomly ordered reason-
ing tasks (see Appendix A). After these tasks, participants
completed measures of Task Involvement, Effort, and
Enjoyment (Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996); slightly modified
to refer to the reasoning tasks used in this study. The Task
Involvement index ( =.74) consisted of six items such as
"While solving the reasoning problems, I was totally
absorbed in the problems." The Task Effort index ( =.95)
included two items such as "I put a lot of effort into solving
the reasoning problems." Lastly, the Task Enjoyment index
( =.80) had three items, including "I enjoyed solving the
reasoning problems." Ratings were made on 7-point scales
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).
Lastly, participants completed a demographics question-
naire that included gender, age, major, ethnicity, and ACT
scores. Participants were debriefed before leaving.
Results
Article Version Effects
We first investigated the impact of the "intelligence" article
(incremental vs. entity) on participants' ability beliefs. We
reverse coded all entity items on the eight-item intelligence
questionnaire and then averaged across items so that higher
4 SAGE Open
scores indicated stronger incremental beliefs. Exposure to
the incremental (vs. entity) article caused higher incremen-
tal scores, t(98) = 4.74, p < .001; MIncremental
= 38.7, SD =
5.06; MEntity
= 33.2, SD = 7.02. This finding is consistent
with that of previous research in which the same articles
were used to prime participants' ability beliefs (e.g., Miele
& Molden, 2010; Zhao, Zhang, & Vance, 2013). Compared
with Zhao et al. (2013), the present study showed a smaller
magnitude of the manipulation effect. In Zhao et al. (2013),
the article version produced a greater difference between
the incremental and entity groups: MIncremental
= 39.3 versus
MEntity
= 22.6. In particular, the entity group in Zhao et al.
(2013) reported lower incremental scores than the entity
group in the current study.
Analytic Strategy and Data Preparation
We next examined the data for outliers and missing entries.
One case was identified as multivariate outlier, and thus
excluded from analysis. The identified case had an outlying
Cook's d value associated with verbal reasoning perfor-
mance (larger than 1.20; next largest Cook's d value was
0.18). This case also had a Mahalanobis D2 (Mahalanobis,
1936; Schinka, Velicer, & Weiner, 2003) with a probability
less than .001 (D2 = 40.05, p = .00001). Another seven par-
ticipants did not report ACT scores, resulting in a final sam-
ple of 92 for analysis.
To test our hypothesis that incremental beliefs of ability
might reduce the threat of self-doubt and yield positive out-
comes, we performed multiple regressions predicting each of
the following: performance on each of the two tasks, mea-
sures of task engagement, and well-being measures. We pre-
dicted these outcomes using dummy-coded article version
(incremental vs. entity), standardized self-doubt scores, stan-
dardized ACT scores, and all interactions. Regression results
showed that article version did not interact with self-doubt or
ACT scores to predict any of the dependent variables, p >
.05. Although article version affected beliefs about intelli-
gence, it was not directly related to our hypothesized effects
on the DVs. One possible explanation for this finding is that
the belief manipulation in the present study did not impact
participants'beliefs as strongly as it could have. As indicated
earlier, our manipulation produced a smaller magnitude of
effect, compared with Zhao et al. (2013) where the same
articles were used to manipulate beliefs.
We subsequently collapsed across the article version fac-
tor and replaced it with the standardized continuous measure
of (post-article) incremental belief scores. This change
altered our approach from an experimental to correlational
one. We present our results organized into three sections
below:"TaskPerformance,""MeasuresofTaskEngagement,"
and "Measures of Well-Being." We predicted these outcomes
using standardized incremental beliefs, standardized self-
doubt scores, standardized ACT scores, and all interactions.
The ACT variable was included in our regression model to
increase power by controlling for what would otherwise be
error variance, and to allow us to investigate whether our
theoretically expected effects would be particularly strong
among low-ACT individuals for whom actual ability did not
already suggest high levels of performance and engagement.
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of our predictor and
outcome variables, as well as correlations between them.
Task Performance
Participants' performance on the two experimental tasks was
first analyzed. Results for both tasks' regression models with
standardized self-doubt, implicit theories, and ACT, includ-
ing all interactions, showed F statistics significant at p < .001
levels. For verbal reasoning and anagram performance,
adjusted R2s were .34 and .32, respectively.
On verbal reasoning performance (M = 11.78 of 15 =
78.5% correct, SD = 2.32), there was a three-way interaction
among self-doubt, incremental belief, and ACT scores, B =
-1.07 (SE = .32), p = .001. The three-way interaction quali-
fies the lower order effects, including a two-way interaction
between self-doubt and incremental belief, p = .006, and a
two-way interaction between ACT scores and incremental
belief, p = .03. Simple slopes tests (Aiken & West, 1991)
were used to analyze the three-way interaction (Figure 1).
The results showed that for those with relatively higher ACT
scores (+1 SD), the self-doubt × incremental belief interac-
tion was not significant, B = -0.35 (SE = .35), p = .32.
However, for individuals with relatively low ACT scores
(-1 SD), their performance was affected by a significant
two-way interaction between self-doubt and incremental
belief, B = 1.78 (SE = .46), p < .001. The two-way interac-
tion was such that for participants relatively low in incre-
mental beliefs (-1 SD), higher self-doubt was associated
with lower performance, B = -2.36 (SE = .69), p = .001, as
expected. However, for individuals higher in incremental
beliefs (+1 SD), the self-doubt effect was reversed. Self-
doubt was positively associated with performance, B = 1.20
(SE = .44), p = .007. This finding supports the hypothesis
that incremental beliefs can change the nature of self-doubt
effects, particularly for those with lower ACT scores, who
may feel less competent (cf. Ommundsen, 2001).
On anagram performance (M = 8.65 of 15 = 57.7% correct,
SD = 4.16), there was a two-way interaction between self-
doubt and incremental belief (Figure 2), B = 1.16 (SE = .46),
p = .01, in addition to an effect of ACT scores, p < .001. No
other effects were significant, p > .10. Simple slope tests of
the interaction showed a significant positive relationship
between self-doubt and performance for individuals with rel-
atively high incremental beliefs (+1 SD), B = 1.35 (SE = .49),
p = .007. In contrast, for those with relatively low incremental
beliefs (-1 SD), self-doubt was negatively related to perfor-
mance (B = -0.98, SE = .71, p = .17), although the association
did not reach significance. This pattern echoes the findings
for verbal reasoning, although without ACT moderation.
Zhao and Wichman 5
To summarize, incremental beliefs about ability amelio-
rated the negative impact of self-doubt on task performance.
On the verbal reasoning task, this was particularly true for
individuals with low (ACT-assessed) actual ability.
Consistent across tasks (verbal reasoning and anagram), for
people with strong incremental beliefs, a sense of self-doubt
was positively associated with performance. In contrast, for
people with strong entity beliefs, the overall pattern was that
self-doubt impaired performance, with the proviso that ACT
scores moderated this effect on the verbal reasoning task.
Measures of Task Engagement
We next analyzed measures of task involvement, effort, and
enjoyment with the same standardized predictor variables
and interaction terms. Regression results showed that model
F statistics were significant for task involvement (p < .001;
adjusted R2 = .20) and task enjoyment (p = .01; adjusted R2 =
.12), but not for task effort, p >.10.
On task involvement, there was a marginal three-way
interaction among self-doubt, incremental belief, and ACT
scores, B = -1.4 (SE = .74), p = .06, in addition to a mar-
ginal two-way interaction between self-doubt and incre-
mental belief, p = .06, a two-way interaction between ACT
scores and self-doubt, p = .02, and effects of self-doubt,
p <.001, and ACT scores, p =.03. The three-way interac-
tion (Figure 3) was again analyzed with simple slopes

tests. The results mirrored the performance results on the
verbal reasoning task. The self-doubt × incremental belief
interaction was not significant for individuals with rela-
tively high ACT scores (+1 SD), B = -0.31 (SE = .80), p =
.71. However, individuals with relatively low ACT scores
(-1 SD) showed a significant two-way interaction between
self-doubt and incremental belief, B = 2.49 (SE = 1.07),
p = .02. Specifically, for low-ACT individuals relatively
high in incremental beliefs (+1 SD), self-doubt was not
significantly associated with task involvement, B = -0.89
(SE = 1.00), p = .38. However, for low-ACT individuals
who also were relatively low in incremental beliefs (-1
SD), higher self-doubt was associated with lower task
involvement, B = -5.88 (SE = 1.60), p < .001. These results
further support the idea that the negative effects of self-
doubt can be ameliorated by incremental beliefs.
On task enjoyment, there was also a marginal three-way
interaction among self-doubt, incremental belief, and ACT
scores, B = -0.96 (SE = .50), p = .06, in addition to effects
of incremental beliefs, p = .03 and ACT scores, p = .02.
Considering the three-way interaction on task enjoyment
(Figure 4), the results were again consistent with our
hypothesis. For individuals with relatively low ACT scores
(-1 SD), self-doubt × incremental belief interaction was
significant, B = 1.12 (SE = .54), p = .04. Further analysis
showed that for low-ACT individuals relatively high in
incremental beliefs (+1 SD), self-doubt was not signifi-
cantly associated with task enjoyment, B = 0.29 (SE = .68),
p = .67. For low-ACT individuals also relatively low in
incremental beliefs (-1 SD), though, higher self-doubt was
associated with lower task enjoyment, B = -2.53 (SE =
1.09), p = .02. Consistent with previous research showing
that implicit theories are most important under conditions
of low ability or perceived adversity, the self-doubt × incre-
mental belief interaction was not significant, B = 0.05
(SE = .51), p = .93, for those with higher ACT scores.
These results are consistent with the findings for our task
performance measures. Incremental beliefs about ability
ameliorated the negative impact of self-doubt on task
involvement and enjoyment, particularly for individuals with
low actual ability. For low-ability individuals with strong
incremental beliefs, self-doubt was unrelated to task involve-
ment or enjoyment. However, for low-ability individuals
with entity beliefs, self-doubt predicted less task involve-
ment and enjoyment.
Measures of Well-Being
We also analyzed measures of affect, performance self-
esteem, and task anxiety. Results showed that the F statistic
was significant for each of the models, ps  .04. The

adjusted R2s were .08, .26, .55, and .46 for positive and
negative affect, performance self-esteem, and task anxiety,
respectively.
On positive affect, there was an effect of self-doubt, B =
-1.75 (SE = .81), p = .03. Higher self-doubt was associated
with lower positive affect. No other effects were significant, ps
>.05. On negative affect, there was also an effect of self-doubt,
B = 3.10 (SE = .59), p < .001, and, consistent with our findings
for other measures, this effect was qualified by a two-way
interaction between self-doubt and incremental beliefs, B =
-1.766 (SE = .67), p = .01. This interaction was plotted (Figure
5) and investigated with simple slopes tests. The results
showed that higher self-doubt was associated with greater
negative affect for participants with low incremental scores
(-1 SD), B = 4.86 (SE = 1.04), p < .001; this negative effect of
self-doubt was only marginally significant for those with high
incremental scores (+1 SD), B = 1.33 (SE = .72), p = .07. Self-
doubt did not interact with incremental beliefs to predict either
performance self-esteem or task anxiety. However, ACT
scores (actual ability) moderated self-doubt effects on these
variables (see Appendix B for these results).
Discussion
Previous research shows negative relationships between self-
doubt and a variety of outcome measures. We hypothesized
that incremental beliefs could change these relationships.
Although the article version (incremental or entity) did not
interact with self-doubt or ACT score on our outcome vari-
ables, we were able to collapse across this factor and test our
hypothesis with the post-article incremental belief scores.
Keeping this in mind, our data are consistent with our main
hypotheses. For all performance and task engagement mea-
sures (except the effort measure), incremental beliefs moder-
ated self-doubt effects. Interestingly, these theoretically
expected effects were further moderated by ACT for verbal
reasoning performance, task involvement, and enjoyment.
Incremental beliefs ameliorated self-doubt effects on these
outcome measures, particularly for low-ACT individuals.
Beliefs about ability affect responses in performance situa-
tions (see Dweck, 2012, for a review). Here, we show that
these beliefs also can moderate the effects of self-doubt. These
findings suggest that those who are particularly vulnerable to
the threat of self-doubt are individuals who have low academic
ability and believe that ability cannot be changed. Presumably,
having a sense of self-doubt is less damaging if individuals
believe that ability can be improved through effort. This mod-
eration effect indicates that self-doubt matters most on an aca-
demic performance task when it is perceived to index stable,
low ability (cf. Seligman, Abramson, Semmel, & von Baeyer,
1979). Although this is a novel way to think about self-doubt,
it is consistent with the consequences of an explanatory style
that attributes negative outcomes to stable, internal, and global
causes (Peterson, Seligman, & Vaillant, 1988). Self-doubt
matters most when it is seen as stable. Self-doubt is by defini-
tion about an internal factor, ability. Only globality remains
unspecified for high self-doubt, entity theory holders.
One plausible mechanism for our moderation effects is
that incremental beliefs may have made self-doubters more
motivated (or even "fired up") to do well on the tasks and
hence eliminated the performance difference between high
and low self-doubt groups. With entity beliefs, high self-
doubt likely yields lower motivation relative to low self-
doubt. Consistent with this idea, we found that incremental
beliefs moderated self-doubt effects for performance mea-
sures and the task engagement measures of involvement and
enjoyment. We found no incremental belief effects on the
effort measure, consistent with past evidence that self-doubt-
ers with entity beliefs can adopt either self-handicapping
(effort withdrawing) or subjective overachievement (effort
enhancing) coping strategies. These strategies may have
combined to eliminate consistent self-doubt effects on the
effort measure. Another possible mechanism for consider-
ation is that instead of focusing on how incremental theories
boost motivation among high self-doubt individuals, one
could consider how in the presence of perceived low compe-
tence, or after failure feedback, incremental theories have
been shown to be more influential (Job et al., 2010; Pollack
et al., 2012). That is, rather than incremental theories moder-
ating self-doubt effects, perhaps it is self-doubt that moder-
ates incremental theories effects. Although experimental
research would be required to adequately test this idea, it
would be consistent with previous research showing that
incremental theories matter under conditions of relative
adversity. This said, the evidence here suggests that incre-
mental beliefs made self-doubters more deeply involved in
the tasks and enjoyed the tasks more, which in turn, improved
their actual performance.
Further considering the specific results we found, in the
case of verbal reasoning, task involvement, and task enjoy-
ment, the effects of self-doubt and incremental beliefs were
moderated by participant ability (ACT score). This effect
suggests that self-doubt matters when it is considered diag-
nostic for performance (i.e., in the absence of a strong basis
Figure 5. Effects of self-doubt on negative affect, as moderated
by incremental beliefs.
8 SAGE Open
for expecting success due to high ability), and that only under
conditions where self-doubt matters do incremental beliefs
moderate its effect. To be more specific, self-doubt reflects
doubts about ability. ACT is an objective measure of aca-
demic competence and can be understood as a proxy for per-
formance efficacy. To the degree that competence is high,
self-doubt might be expected to be less influential for perfor-
mance, by such mechanisms as higher competence being
associated with more ability-relevant knowledge and greater
personal experience with the ability-related domain. In other
words, subjective doubt effects on performance may simply
be out-weighed by superior competence.
The absence of ACT moderation for anagram perfor-
mance probably reflects the fact that the ACT does not assess
the kind of combinatory processes required to solve ana-
grams. It may also be the case that participants found the
anagram task to be much more difficult than the verbal rea-
soning task, so that their efficacy to successfully complete
each task was poor regardless of ACT-assessed ability level.
This is consistent with the fact that mean performance on the
anagram tasks (57.7%) was lower than performance on the
verbal reasoning task (78.5%). Under conditions where
ACT-assessed abilities were not clearly relevant to perfor-
mance, self-doubt was likely considered more diagnostic,
opening the door for the moderation of self-doubt by incre-
mental beliefs.
Considering the measures of well-being, incremental
beliefs moderated the impact of self-doubt on general nega-
tive affect, but not on performance self-esteem or task anxi-
ety. For these variables, ACT scores (not beliefs about
ability) moderated self-doubt effects, such that self-doubt
predicted lower self-esteem and higher anxiety when ACT
were lower (see Appendix B). This suggests that in terms of
negative emotion relating to specific task performance, per-
formance efficacy may be more effective than incremental
beliefs at pre-emptively buffering people prior to perfor-
mance execution. We need to further investigate these ideas,
but the fact remains that on nearly all our performance and
task engagement measures, we found support for the hypoth-
esis that implicit beliefs moderate self-doubt effects.
The present study is not without its weaknesses. For
instance, our sample is relatively small, and these data ulti-
mately are correlational. Although measurement of both self-
doubt and incremental beliefs came before exposure to the
dependent measures, there could be a third variable associated
with one or more of our individual difference predictors that
might be truly causal. Although the nature of our interaction
effects makes it difficult to identify a possible third variable
that could account for these results, it remains a possibility. We
caution readers that although our correlational study resulted
in the outcomes we expected from experimental manipulation
of implicit theories, that the conclusions we draw do not have
the same certainty as those that would be derived from experi-
mental evidence. Furthermore, we have presented a single
study, which would benefit from replication and extension.
Going forward, it will be useful to achieve greater clarity on
the factors that caused our effects. Future research will hope-
fully demonstrate that these findings are robust when subjected
to experimental testing. Also going forward, these results have
significant implications for some cross-cultural research.
Research suggests that students from ConfucianAsian countries
(e.g., Hong Kong-China, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore)
have high academic achievement, but also higher levels of self-
doubt, compared with students from European countries (e.g.,
Lee, 2009; Wilkins, 2004). There may be cultural differences in
people's beliefs about ability and interpretations of self-doubt.
For example, ability is commonly believed to be innate and rela-
tively stable in Western society (Weiner, 1986), and it is consid-
ered more important to succeed because of high ability than
because of high effort (Covington & Omelich, 1979; Jones,
1990). However, in Confucian culture, ability is believed to be
malleable through hard work (Hau & Salili, 1991, 1996) and
people may harness self-doubt as motivation to work harder
(Hau & Ho, 2010). If the causal role of incremental theories of
intelligence moderating self-doubt effects can be experimen-
tally established, it may eventually be extended to provide an
explanation for some cultural differences.
We have known for some time that metacognitions can
influence each other (e.g., Wichman et al., 2010). However,
this example of self-doubt and implicit beliefs, as uncertainty
and malleability metacognitions targeting ability, is the first
application of this idea to better understand academic
achievement. Our findings suggest that the most vulnerable
group to the threat of self-doubt is the one with low academic
achievement and entity beliefs about ability. Shifting mind-
sets to believe in the malleability of ability ameliorates self-
doubteffects,notonlyintermsofenhancingtaskperformance
and engagement, but also in improving general affect/well-
being. We look forward to seeing additional tests of this idea,
and to developing it to achieve better performance and well-
being outcomes.
Appendix A
Examples of the Reasoning Tasks
1. One of the tasks involves solving a set of 15 verbal
reasoning problems. Each verbal reasoning problem
involves analogies and you must choose the one
alternative that best completes the statement or
answers the question.
Here is an example:

Elated is to despondent as enlightened is
to______B______
A. aware B. ignorant C. miserable D. tolerant
2. Another task involves solving a set of 15 everyday
vocabulary anagrams. An anagram is a word made by
using letters of another word in a different order. You
must enter the anagram at the end of each word.

Additional Results on Performance Self-Esteem
and Task Anxiety
On performance self-esteem, the regression coefficients
revealed a two-way interaction between self-doubt and ACT
scores, B = 0.88 (SE = .44), p =.05, in addition to effects of
self-doubt (p < .001) and ACT scores (p < .001). No other
effects were significant, ps > .05. The same pattern of results
was observed for task anxiety: Effects of self-doubt (p <
.001) and ACT scores (p = .02) were qualified by a two-way
interaction between self-doubt and ACT scores, B = -2.55
(SE = .99), p =.01. The nature of these interactions was such
that self-doubt significantly predicted lower self-esteem and
higher anxiety, particularly for people with relatively lower
ACT scores. For participants with low ACT scores (-1 SD),
higher self-doubt was associated with lower performance
self-esteem, B = -4.241 (SE = .51), p < .001, and greater task
anxiety, B = 9.404 (SE = 1.36), p < .001; but for those with
relatively high ACT scores (+1 SD), the magnitude of the
self-doubt effect was reduced on performance self-esteem,
B = -2.568 (SE = .51), p < .001, or task anxiety, B = 4.305
(SE = 1.27), p = .001. Conceptually supporting our reasoning
with incremental beliefs about ability, these results show that
for performance self-esteem and task anxiety, actual ability
(not beliefs about ability) moderated self-doubt effects.
