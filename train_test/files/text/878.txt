This article examines the theoretical connection between health capital and financial capital
in an economic life-cycle model, exploring possible explanations for racial differences in
capital accumulation behavior. Using data from the Health and Retirement Survey, detailed
descriptive analysis and a comparison of regression models for health and financial capital are
presented. The results, although preliminary and based on cross-section data, suggest possible
racial differences in the connection between health and wealth and deserve further study.

Racial Differences1
Dennis G. Shea, PhD,2 Toni Miles, MD, PhD,3 and Mark Hayward, PhD*
The idea of documenting and attempting to ex-
plain differences in economic well-being and health
status across racial categories is hardly novel. A large
and growing literature explores differences in in-
come, wealth, health status, health service use, and a
wide variety of other measures. This article, how-
ever, offers an exploratory analysis of a model of
health and wealth capital, recognizing that both rep-
resent investments in assets, earning future returns.
The importance of this study rests in understand-
ing several theoretical and empirical issues that de-
serve further exploration. Investments in both
wealth capital and health (as well as in other forms of
human capital like education) generate direct and
indirect returns in the forms of greater income,
higher wages, increased productivity, lower morbid-
ity, and longer life. Empirically, race is well-known to
be an important source of stratification in health and
wealth. Blacks experience higher morbidity and mor-
tality and are economically disadvantaged in compar-
ison to whites. It is not clear, however, how race (or
even whether race) influences investments in finan-
cial and health capital, despite the important life-
cycle consequences of these investments.
Differences in investment behavior are one of
many factors that might be linked to recent policy
debates. For example, some early research suggests
that the personal savings rate among Americans is far
too low to sustain lengthy retirements (Diamond,
1977). At the same time, private and public invest-
ments in health capital continue to extend life. The
failure to reconcile these investment behaviors could
lead to even greater poverty and dependence among

the oldest-old in the future. Life-cycle investment
behavior might also be linked to recent increases in
inequality in measures of economic well-being, life-
cycle patterns of inequality, changing patterns of
morbidity and mortality, and a variety of other cross-
sectional and life-cycle phenomena. In short, greater
understanding of how initial stratification might lead
to differences in investment behavior can help iden-
tify how public policy and private behaviors may
result in pernicious late-life economic and health
outcomes. Understanding the causes and effects of
these stratifications can help policymakers address
the growing diversity in the physical and financial
well-being of the elderly.
This article begins with an exploration of some of
the previous research on these issues. Given the vol-
ume of previous research, however, this is not meant
to be an exhaustive review. This review is followed by
a brief discussion of dynamic economic models of
health and wealth, focusing on some of the implica-
tions of these models for estimating demand for
health capital and wealth capital and the potential role
of race in these models. Finally, a Results section
explores some of the joint patterns of health and
wealth in the Health and Retirement Survey data and
offers exploratory models of health and wealth capital
that suggest some potential differences among blacks
and whites in these investments.
Wealth and Health
A trend in increasing income inequality in the
United States has been noted often in the last de-
cade. Work by Levy (1987) on the changing income
distribution received perhaps the most attention
from the popular press. Several other studies have
since followed, confirming the trend and seeking
explanations in economic structural shifts, govern-
ment welfare policies, and a variety of other sources
(Danziger & Gottschalk, 1994, offered an overview).
Although data on wealth distributions is less often
available, some research indicates a similar pattern
342 The Gerontologist
of increasing inequality in wealth in the United States
in recent years. Perhaps the best exploration of this is
found in Wolff and Marley (1990).
In related research, Crystal and Shea (1990a)
showed that a measure of economic inequality (the
Cini index of income adjusted for household size,
underreporting and the value of assets) has a U-
shaped pattern in cross-sectional data, with inequal-
ity in economic well-being highest among older per-
sons. Similar results exist from work using data as
early as 1967 (Taussig, 1973). Furthermore, these
studies show a racial disparity in economic well-
being that is larger at older ages than at younger
ages, with older blacks having about 50% of the
economic resources of older whites, compared to 60
to 70% at younger ages, despite the presence of
significant income transfers at older ages.
Crystal and Shea (1990b) labeled this increased
inequality "cumulative disadvantage," representing
its possible connection to early deficits accumulating
over the life-cycle to result in wider disparities at
older ages. The cross-sectional data, of course, can-
not reveal whether this pattern is a cohort or a life-
cycle effect. At the very least, this research raises the
issue of how recent increases in economic inequality
might in part be related to life-cycle patterns of
wealth accumulation and demographic change.
At the same time that research has focused on both
levels of and trends in inequality in wealth and in-
come, there has been growing interest and evidence
on levels and trends in inequality or inequities in
various health measures, including health status,
health services use, and health insurance. Kunst and
Mackenbach (1994) demonstrated high levels of in-
equality in mortality rates by education class in the
United States, when compared with European na-
tions, and noted the possible link between income
and health inequalities in Wilkinson's studies (1992a,
1992b). Kochanek, Maurer, and Rosenberg (1994)
contrast the growth in white life expectancy with the
decline in black life expectancy in the United States
from 1984 to 1989. This decline is largely related to
the experience of young blacks, however, as older
blacks have experienced increasing life expectancy
over time. Rogers (1992) found a profound link be-
tween sociodemographic factors such as income and
the racial gap in mortality. Nickens (1995) also docu-
mented the racial differences in mortality rates in the
United States and clearly showed the curious nar-
rowing of the racial mortality gap at older ages.
Recent evidence presented by Elo and Preston
(1994), however, questions this late-life result.
Starr (1986) noted the work of Davis and Schoen
(1978) and others in demonstrating improvements in
access for many disadvantaged populations in the
1970s in comparison to the pre-Medicare and Medi-
caid era. As numbers of the uninsured increased in
the 1980s, more recent work, summarized by Fried-
man (1994) documents some of the disparities in
health services use across racial and other lines that
have persisted and expanded. Differences in levels
of care for blacks with cardiac diseases, kidney dis-
ease, mental illnesses, and a wide variety of other
types of care have been studied. Data also show
older blacks are less likely to have insurance cover-
age other than Medicare and Medicaid and have less
comprehensive coverage (Chulis, Eppig, Hogan,
Waldo, & Arnett, 1993; Long, Settle, & Link, 1982;
Shea & Stewart, 1994).
Although previous research does not ignore the
important connections between wealth and health,
the issue has certainly been inadequately explored
(in part, because of the lack of data that combine
good information on health and economic vari-
ables). A few recent studies, often associated with
the National Bureau of Economic Research program
on the economics of aging, have explored models of
savings and wealth accumulation among older per-
sons, exploring precautionary, bequest, and other
motives for saving. Although some of these models,
especially those of precautionary saving, consider
aspects of health, only a few of these (Diamond &
Hausman, 1984; Kotlikoff, 1989) offer a detailed con-
sideration of the interplay between health and
wealth. That work indicates that health may be an
important determinant of wealth and savings among
the elderly.
Studies of health capital accumulation that explicitly
consider wealth are even rarer. Wagstaff (1986) imple-
mented a Grossman demand for health model that
explicitly considered the role of assets. His results
indicated a positive relationship between assets and
demand for health capital; however, the results sug-
gest important data and estimation problems that may
bias the estimates. In particular, attempts to estimate
these models with cross-sectional data are often
plagued with unresolved problems of endogeneity
and multicollinearity.
Private resources for health may be more important
for older persons in the future because of probable
reductions in both Medicare benefits and in insurance
coverage supplemental to Medicare. Changes in ac-
counting for retiree health benefits offered to former
employees have dramatically affected the willingness
of companies to maintain past levels of coverage (de
Lissovoy, Kasper, DiCarlo, & Gabel, 1990). Shea and
Stewart (1994) showed that black persons would be far
less likely to be able to afford increases in the cost of
retiree health benefit coverage. With decreases in
both Medicare coverage and private health insurance
coverage likely in the future, private resources to pay
for health care and maintain health at older ages will
become increasingly important.
Just as private resources may be more important
for health care costs in the future, private resources
are gaining increased importance as a source of eco-
nomic well-being among the elderly. In 1986,26% of
total income among the elderly came from asset
sources, more than double the share from two de-
cades earlier (Grad, 1988). Given life-cycle disparities
in education, employment patterns, health, and as-
sets, this movement toward reliance on individual
savings for retirement income may exacerbate racial
differences in economic well-being and health status
in late life.
Although this review has offered many threads,
Vol.36, No. 3,1996 343
the theme emphasized can be stated succinctly. Re-
cent evidence indicates that high and growing levels
of inequality in economic well-being and health,
particularly along racial lines, are coupled with a
probable trend toward increased reliance on private
resources for support at older ages. Although theory
and empirical work have offered some initial clues
about the relationship between wealth and health,
and how it might differ along racial lines, data limita-
tions have hampered more detailed studies. This
article attempts to make an exploratory use of the
Health and Retirement Survey data to consider racial
differences in the determinants of health and wealth
capital at older ages (Juster & Suzman, 1994; data
gathered in 1991).
An Illustrative Model
The most common economic approach to examin-
ing the relationship between health and wealth has
been through studying the effects of "initial wealth"
on demand for health capital in the Grossman model
of demand for health (Grossman, 1972; Wagstaff,
1986). In this section, we briefly discuss the health-
wealth relationship in such models of life-cycle be-
havior.
The individual's problem is to choose paths over
the life cycle for Z, a consumption commodity, and
h, the flow of health from a stock of health capital, H.
The flow of health, h, in a given year might be
considered to be the number of healthy days a per-
son experiences. The flow of healthy days is related
to the person's stock of health capital, just as a stock
of assets can produce a stream of income through
interest or dividends. Lifetime utility, V, depends on
the utility derived in each period from Z and h,
appropriately discounted.
The stock of health capital, H, is produced with
combinations of medical care and other goods. It is
assumed to depreciate at a given rate that may de-
pend on age -- higher ages being associated with
faster rates of depreciation. Financial or wealth capi-
tal, A, grows as a function of the difference between
income, including interest income earned on wealth,
and expenditures on medical care, and the con-
sumption good. The individual is assumed to begin
life with a given stock of health capital, Ho
, and
financial capital, Ao
. The individual then chooses in
each period purchases of consumption goods and
medical goods to produce health and provide utility.
Given income, the level of financial assets then
evolves according to the difference between income
and these expenditures.
Although the actual form for these equations of
motion for the stock of assets and health or for the
level of assets or health at a given time is compli-
cated, it can be shown that this expression depends
on the marginal utility of initial health and wealth, or
how consumers value incremental additions to their
initial stocks of assets or health. As is common in
these types of models (Killingsworth, 1983), the mar-
ginal utilities are endogenous; they evolve over time
as the consumer's conditions change. Because of
this endogeneity, the comparative dynamic relation-
ship -- an exploration of the different time paths of
variables -- between choice variables is often exam-
ined in these models in two-step fashion. First, the
time path of the variables is examined, holding con-
stant the endogenous marginal utility. Then, mar-
ginal utilities are varied to examine this impact.
The marginal utility constant effects of a variation
in Ho
on assets depends upon how initial health
impacts income and consumption of medical care
goods and other consumption goods. Assume that
persons with lower initial health leads will not have
greater income than persons with higher initial
health and that persons with lower health begin life
with lower wealth as well. It can be shown that lower
initial health will lead to higher consumption of med-
ical care over the life cycle; however, the impact on
consumption goods cannot be determined a priori.
If we describe as "health inferior" the situation in
which lower initial health leads to increased con-
sumption of consumption goods, then we can show
that lower health leads to lower assets. Lower in-
come and initial lower wealth coupled with higher
expenditures on both types of goods for persons
with low initial health implies that their wealth must
continue to be below that of a person with better
initial health. Furthermore, as long as the increased
medical care consumption does not lead to a com-
plete removal of the initial health gap, we should find
persons with low health also having low wealth.
Thus, if individuals begin life with lower initial
health, their ability to accumulate wealth, assuming
that their income is similar to that of other persons, is
limited by their ability to produce health and their
tastes for health and consumption. If health and
consumption are inferior, then an individual with
low initial health will consume both more medical
goods to augment health and more consumption
goods, because of his or her tastes for consumption.
As a result, such an individual forgoes building up
financial capital, choosing to use income and any
initial assets to consume consumption goods and
medical care goods.
This analysis, however, depends critically on the
connection between initial health and consumption
(not to mention the connection between initial
health and wealth, and income and health). Sup-
pose, however, that a person with low initial health
chooses instead to undertake a form of self-
insurance against future expected medical expenses.
This person might forgo consumption expenditures
in comparison with a person with higher initial
health. Consumption of this sort could be called
"health normal" because lower health leads to lower
consumption. The time path of assets for this person
may result in wealth at some future period exceeding
that of wealth of a person with better initial health,
although health may still lag. As a result, the person
with lower initial health may, at certain points in the
time path, have lower health, but greater wealth.
The marginal utility constant effects noted here in
both the health inferior and the health normal cases
become less clear if we consider what happens when
344 The Gerontologist
we allow marginal utilities to vary. In that case, it can
be shown that consumption of medical care and
consumption of consumer goods, move in the oppo-
site direction, and as a result, assets and health at any
date of the person with lower initial health could be
higher or lower depending on the net effects.
The economic model of wealth and health accu-
mulation, then, offers no strong prediction for the
direction of the relationship between them. It is
possible that the relationship could be described as
one of "substitutes," in the sense that asset accumu-
lation is foregone in the pursuit of health, leading to
a negative correlation between the stock of assets
and the stock of health. A complementary relation-
ship is also possible, however, with health and
wealth positively correlated.
A simple example might help to detail how some of
the racial differences impact the life-cycle path. Con-
sider a black child born with a typical endowment of
wealth and health capital. She begins life with lower
wealth and, perhaps because of this, lower health
than the typical white child. Low wealth may con-
tinue to adversely affect this child's health and edu-
cational attainment during the early years. Further-
more, poor health may feed back into poor
educational attainment, too. This further limits fu-
ture wealth accumulation by impairing labor market
potential. The initial experience may lead to low
valuations of further health or wealth capital (low
marginal utilities) because of the poor prospects for
future returns. As a result, initial stratification and
subsequent behavior conditioned on that stratifica-
tion lead to less wealth, income, and saving and
poorer health (and health behaviors) in adulthood.
The final outcome is a late-life experience character-
ized by poor economic well-being and poor health.
Although this example might describe a more
common experience, the economic theory does not
rule out the alternative described earlier. A potential
response of the individual is to reduce consumption
in response to the initial health deficit. This child
might save at a greater rate than a person with better
initial health. As a result, an examination of stocks of
assets and stocks of health in later life might show
some negative correlation.
In addition, this simple model ignores other dy-
namic aspects of this relationship. The dependence
of income on health, the consideration of health
insurance as yet another substitutable asset in this
relationship, and the importance of the family as a
source of both financial and medical support could
add further realism to the model. In the exploratory
results that follow, however, we merely explore in
some descriptive detail the distribution of health and
wealth across racial lines and use a simple regression
model of differences in the determinants of health
and wealth among blacks and whites.
Data and Methods
Data for this article are from the gamma release of
Health and Retirement Study Wave I. This data set
includes 12,652 persons who are either age 51 to 61 or
are a household member in the household of some-
one age 51 to 61. This project uses persons reporting
race as either black or white, excluding persons of
other races and persons reporting Hispanic ethnic-
ity, for a total sample of 11,176, with 2,064 persons
reporting themselves to be black.
The summary total family net worth variable (using
imputed data) is used for all of the descriptive tables
and regression models. In the analysis, several differ-
ent health measures were employed, including self-
perceived health and reports of medical conditions.
For the presentation of most results we employ self-
perceived health. Table 1 provides basic descriptive
information on these two variables and other vari-
ables used in analyses.
The descriptive tables and graphs examine the dis-
tribution of wealth across health and the health mea-

presented for all persons together (excluding persons
who are not black or white) and for black and white
persons separately to identify any differences.
The regressions, using unweighted data, explore
the racial differences in health and wealth in an
exploratory fashion. Obviously, a complete explora-
tion of this relationship cannot be achieved without
longitudinal data and without considering the life-
time income of individuals. As future panels of the
Health and Retirement Survey become available and
as they are linked to earnings data, researchers will
be able to offer much more comprehensive models
of the racial differences in health and wealth. We
present a model using the cross-sectional data, in
which initially only a few clearly exogenous variables
are included. Then we estimate a second model in
which many other variables, including some that are
certainly endogenous, are considered.
Regressions are run for the full sample, and then
separately for blacks and whites to identify differ-
ences. The results presented are those using a linear
model for self-perceived health. Nonlinear probit
models showed similar results and the linear models
provide a somewhat easier interpretation. In the
wealth regressions the dependent variable used was
the logarithm of total net worth. For persons with
nonpositive wealth, the dependent variable was set
equal to zero. Finally, it is important to note that the
regressions are run for individuals, but the wealth
measure is family net worth.
Results
Table 2 describes the basic distribution of health
status in the HRS by racial categories. These basic
data have been well-described in previous working
papers and need not be discussed in detail (Liang,
Borawski-Clark, Herzog, & Blaum, 1993; Smith,
1993). Briefly, the tables show that black persons in
the HRS report lower levels of self-perceived health.
When blacks and whites are split according to
whether their total net worth is greater than or less
than $100,000, the racial differences in self-perceived
health remain. For example, blacks with wealth over
$100,000 are more likely to report themselves in fair
health and less likely to report themselves in excel-
lent health. Although not shown in the table, the HRS
data also indicate that black persons are more likely
to report health changes over the previous year in
both the positive and negative directions.
Table 3 offers a little more detailed picture of the
distribution of wealth across the two racial catego-
ries, showing wealth holdings at decile points. This
table can be employed to illustrate the differences in
within racial class wealth inequality. For example, the
ratio of the interquartile range to the median (as well
as the coefficient of variation, which is not shown)
indicates that the standardized variation in wealth is
larger among black persons than among white per-
sons (2.03 versus 2.55), echoing the earlier results of
Crystal and Shea (1990a, 1990b). Table 3 clearly illus-
trates the lower levels of total net worth held by black
persons when compared to white persons. Only
persons above the eighth decile among black per-
sons have total net worth exceeding median total net
worth among whites.
Table 4 expands the analysis of the relationships
between health and wealth. One of the first things to
note is the lower levels of wealth held by blacks even
among those in good health status. Blacks in excel-
lent health status have wealth nearly 20% lower than
white persons in only fair health status.
Table 4 also shows what may be an interesting
wealth difference by health across the racial catego-
ries. Median wealth for blacks in very good health is
15% below median wealth for blacks in excellent
health, while among white persons the median
wealth difference is 20%. As we move to lower levels
of self-reported health, however, the pattern
changes. Median wealth falls more dramatically
among black persons than among white persons as
we move from very good to good health status, good

to fair health status, and fair to poor health status.
Although median wealth among white persons
shows declines as well as we examine those in poorer
health status, the declines are comparatively smaller.
For example, white persons in fair health have me-
dian wealth that is 44% of the median wealth figure
for white persons in excellent health, whereas for
black persons this ratio for fair health is 37%. Even
more dramatically, white persons in poor health
have total net worth that is more than 20% of that for
persons in excellent health; among black persons
this ratio is less than 2%. An interesting racial differ-
ence thus appears in this table. Black persons with
health better than "average" appear to show com-
paratively smaller gains in wealth, while those with
health below "average" have dramatic drops in
wealth compared to their white peers.
This difference is not entirely clear and may in fact
be simply a result of the overall lower levels of wealth
among blacks. Nonetheless, at higher health levels,
black persons do not show the tendency for much
greater wealth accumulation than white persons do,
and at lower health levels, blacks show much lower
wealth levels. Table 5 shows one potential explana-
tion, perhaps, for some of the features of the wealth
data. This table shows median wealth by persons
reporting ever having had a health condition. The
key feature of this table is the comparatively larger
decrements in wealth among people who report
chronic illnesses, compared to a more acute illness,
such as cancer. Thus, the differences across racial
categories in disease prevalence, and the conse-
quences of these diseases in terms of labor market
outcomes and health care costs, may help to explain
both the health and wealth held by individuals.
The economic model offers one -- among numer-
ous other -- explanations for the health and wealth
holdings of black and white persons. If white per-
sons and black persons differ in their substitution
behavior toward health capital and financial capital,
then whites in poorer health might be more or less
likely to substitute wealth for poor health than would
black persons. To begin to investigate that phenome-
non, regression models of health and wealth capital
were run. The models were estimated first for all
persons, then, by racial categories. Tables 6 through
9 display the results for the models.
Table 6 shows the results of the wealth regressions
for the full sample, the sample of black persons, and

the sample of white persons in HRS. Clearly, there
are some differences in the impacts of gender, edu-
cation, and marital status on wealth. The impact of
gender on wealth is clearly stronger and more nega-
tive among blacks than among whites. Education,
marital status, and father's education have a larger
impact on wealth among whites than they do among
blacks.
Table 7 shows a similar initial regression for health.
In this model we again see some clear differences
between blacks and whites. Health is negatively as-
sociated with being female, with widowhood, and
with divorce among blacks, but positively associated
with these variables among whites. Father's educa-
tion has a significant impact for whites, but not for
blacks. Furthermore, education, particularly educa-
tion through the high school level, has a larger im-
pact on the health of whites than the health of blacks.
Table 8 shows the results of a wealth regression in
which several additional variables that might be of
interest have been included. Once again, some nota-
ble differences and similarities can be described and
deserve further analysis. For example, the regres-
sions indicate for both blacks and whites a positive
relationship between wealth and the presence of
health insurance and bequest motives, with similar
magnitudes. On the other hand, the presence of a

pension is related to lower wealth for white persons,
but has little impact on that of blacks in the model.
Table 9 reports a similar regression for the health
variable and also offers some interesting compari-
sons. The impact of smoking and lack of exercise on
health is similar across the two racial groups, each
associated with significantly lower health. Being fe-
male has a much more positive impact on health
among whites, while the marital status variables are
uniformly negative for blacks, but uniformly positive
for whites.
Discussion
The descriptive and analytical results for this article
indicate that there may be important underlying dif-
ferences in the way financial and health capital may
be treated across the life cycle according to race.
Blacks have much lower levels of wealth and health
capital than whites in these data, with particularly
dramatic differences in wealth. As noted in the eco-
nomic model, one explanation for these differences
may be in investment behavior. If black persons
compensate for initial low health by using income to
purchase medical care, wealth accumulation can be
reduced. Furthermore, the initial stratification by
health and wealth can lead to problems in future
accumulation of both wealth and health.
Even at higher levels of wealth, black persons are
more likely to report being in fair or poor health and
less likely to report being in excellent health. Blacks
in poor health have dramatically lower wealth than
blacks in better health; this difference is much less
pronounced for white persons. As noted, one poten-
tial explanation may be differences in the types of
diseases that strike persons of different races.
Chronic conditions appear to have a larger impact on
wealth. Perhaps this is due to their greater impact on
work behavior or their higher medical costs. It might
also result from some effect related to mortality and
disease severity for acute conditions.
The regression results indicate that explanations
for health and wealth accumulation may offer some
interesting differences. The regressions do show
some differences in the sign and significance of cer-
tain variables in regressions run by race, especially
for variables related to marital status and gender. In
addition, some interesting similarities in estimated
relationships between health behaviors and self-per-
ceived health and wealth, bequests, and insurance
are worthy of further exploration.
Certainly there are myriad reasons why we see the
cross-sectional and trend patterns that have been
mentioned. From structural changes in the ma-
croeconomy to initial endowments of health and
economic well-being that begin the life cycle, to
possible differential impacts by disease types, a host
of other factors are important.
Although the patterns do not clearly emerge in this
exploratory study, the possibility that some of the
phenomena may be related to life cycle patterns of
health and asset accumulation and decumulation are
intriguing and deserving of further study. Much past
work has focused on analyzing many decisions older
persons of all races make in isolation -- the decision
to insure, to retire, to save, to purchase health care,
to live with others. With the recent advances in panel
data estimation techniques and the appearance of
longitudinal data from HRS (and the related Asset
and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old [AHEAD]
survey; Hurd, Rodgers, Soldo, & Wallace, 1994), the
possibility of exploring these decisions in a systemic
manner that considers their interrelatedness is in-
triguing.
