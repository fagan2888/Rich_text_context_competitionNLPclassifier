Introduction
Over the last 20 years, there has been a decline in the U.S.
violent crime rate. During this period of time homicides have
declined from a peak in the early 1990s of 9.8 per 100,000 to
5.6 in 2007 (U.S. Department of Justice, 2007). Although
this trend is promising, the decline has not been consistent
among all racial/ethnic groups. Even though Hispanic crime
has declined in a similar fashion to other minority groups
(e.g., African Americans), the rate of homicide for Hispanics
(7.6 per 100,000), although a third of that for African
Americans, is still 3 times higher than the White population
(Logan, Smith, & Stevens, 2011; Martinez & Valenzuela,
2006). Much like the African American community, this
trend of victimization seems to be partially linked to the dis-
organized communities of large urban areas.
Researchers such as Hawkins (1999) assert that there has
been insufficient progress made when attempting to under-
stand the impact of race, ethnicity, and social class in homi-
cide offenses and victimization. Although growing, the
extent of research on the subject of macro-structural factors
on Hispanic homicide is still dwarfed by the research on
other racial/ethnic groups, such as African Americans
(Martinez, 1996, 1997). This gap in the research also leaves
an examination of the unique social/structural characteristics
that influence violent acts among Hispanics practically
untouched (Martinez & Lee, 1999a). There are two reasons
commonly cited for this underrepresentation in the literature.
First, the study of Hispanics is hampered by the limited
amount of official data. Sources such as the Uniform Crime
Report (UCR) fail to accurately report data for the Hispanic
population (Martinez & Lee, 1999a). Second, apart from
those of Mexican ethnicity, prior to the 1970s the Hispanic
population was not recognized as an ethnic group in the
United States. Until this point, much of the official data on
victimization, employment, and so on failed to capture them
(Bean & Tienda, 1987). Currently the recording of Hispanic
ethnicity in the UCR is voluntary on the part of the policing
agent, resulting in an uneven measure of Hispanic crime and
victimization, particularly in cities where the Hispanic popu-
lation is minimal. Another data limitation comes from vic-
tims studies, which to accurately identify the ethnicity of the

Segregation and Hispanic Homicide:
An Examination of Two Measures
of Segregation on Rates of Hispanic
Homicide in Major Metropolitan Areas
Michael G. Bisciglia1
Abstract
As the overall population of Hispanics within the United States has eclipsed that of African Americans, a mounting concern has
developed regarding the rise in Hispanic lethal violence as a result of social and economic inequality. One means to measure
this inequality is in the form of segregation. Research indicates that in many Hispanic communities, their levels of segregation
from the White non-Hispanic population are similar to that of African Americans. Although a multitude of previous studies
have looked at the impact of segregation among African Americans, the literature remains under-represented in terms of
multi-city macro-level analyses among Hispanics. This current study extends the analysis of segregation's effects on lethal
violence to this population. To this end, two measures of segregation were used, the index of dissimilarity and exposure.
Using data from the census and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) mortality files, negative binominal regression models
were created using a sample of 236 U.S. cities. The results indicated that both measures of segregation show a strong positive
influence on rates of Hispanic homicides.

offender requires the presence of the victim as well as an
accurate recollection of the offender.
Given the limitations that exist with the study of Hispanics,
researchers have postulated a variety of explanations to
account for the overrepresentation of minority victimization,
one being residential segregation. Massey and Denton (1993)
have asserted that segregation has become a common feature
of the modern urban community, with its result being that
minority group members, through reduced contact with
Whites, are alienated from social, political, and economic
opportunities. In effect by segregating minorities from main-
stream life, minorities have fallen victim to a number of
negative outcomes, specifically violent crime (Feldmeyer,
2010; Hannon & DeFina, 2005; Krivo, Peterson, & Kuhl,
2009; M. R. Lee & Ousey, 2007; Peterson & Krivo, 1993,
2000; Shihadeh & Bisciglia, 2008; Shihadeh & Flynn, 1996).
It is generally agreed on that the impact of segregation is not
uniformly felt across all racial/ethnic groups. For example,
while the decreased contact of Hispanics to Whites may
increase several negative outcomes, among them victimiza-
tion, it is likely that few if any negative results are felt among
members of the majority group (Shihadeh & Bisciglia, 2008;
Shihadeh & Flynn, 1996).
With these factors in mind, there is an opportunity present
to expand on the literature in reference to these macro-social
relationships. Given that segregation between minority and
majority groups can take a number of different forms, this
analysis seeks to make two contributions. First this study
seeks to bolster the number of multi-city macro-level analy-
ses of Hispanics. Second, this analysis will make use of two
separate measures of segregation (the Index of Dissimilarity
and the Exposure Index) in an effort to determine which of
these measures serves as a stronger predictor of Hispanic
homicide.
Background
Although the American racial majority has generally sup-
ported the concept of racial integration in principle, as Farley
and Frey (1994) reported, in practice little movement has been
made in terms of this majority population accepting minorities
into their neighborhoods. The result of this has been that
minority groups such as Hispanics still face high levels of resi-
dential segregation, in many cities similar to that of African
Americans (Massey & Denton, 1993). This feature of the
modern urban environment has become institutionalized
through real estate and banking practices. Initiatives on the
part of the government have limited mobility for many indi-
viduals within the Hispanic community (Massey & Denton,
1993). This is further complicated by the fact that among the
various Hispanic ethnic groups there is also variation in terms
of race as well. As Massey and Denton (1993) pointed out,
even among Hispanics, those of African American descent
experience levels of segregation much higher than those of
mixed race or of a White racial background.
Examination of the literature concerning the negative
effects of segregation has consistently shown a positive cor-
relation between this and violent crime in non-racially disag-
gregated crime (Hannon & DeFina, 2005; Messner & South,
1986; Potter, 1991; Rosenfeld, 1986; Sampson, 1985; South
& Felson, 1990; Velez, Krivo, & Peterson, 2003). Subsequent
studies have examined racially disaggregated crime that has
shown that the violent crime-segregation link is more precari-
ous for the minority rather than the majority group (Shihadeh
& Bisciglia, 2008; Shihadeh & Flynn, 1996). Furthermore, a
concentration of minorities in the interior of larger cities has
also been shown to be an important element when predicting
criminal violence (Charles, 2003; M. R. Lee, 2000; Parker &
Pruitt, 2000; Shihadeh & Maume, 1997).
Although greater than in the past there are still fewer
macro-social analyses focusing on Hispanics. Nonetheless a
comparison between Hispanics and African Americans does
point to some similarities between these two minority groups.
For example, African Americans and Hispanics experience
high levels of poverty concentration (DeNavas-Walt,
Cleveland, & Roemer, 2001; Quillian, 2012). In addition,
Hispanics have traditionally migrated to similar urban areas,
as African Americans, often taking up residency in formally
African American neighborhoods, thereby placing Hispanics
in a similar structural environment (Cancino, Martinez, &
Stowell, 2009; Cuciti & James, 1990).
Although structural similarities do exist between these
groups, among the Hispanic population there are often addi-
tional challenges, such as the taking in of new immigrants
that theAfricanAmerican community does not face (Sandefur
& Tienda, 1988). As Feldmeyer (2010) noted, the examina-
tion of Hispanics and violent crime victimization has been
limited when examining the impact of residential segrega-
tion. Although past studies have shown structural similarities
between these two groups, there are additional issues that
may impact the Hispanic population differently than African
Americans. For example many Hispanics, primarily those
who are a part of the recent immigrant group, face barriers to
employment, political, and social institutions. Additional
many must overcome language barriers, which is not a prob-
lem for most members of other urban poor groups.As a result
Hispanics often face higher levels of segregation (Charles,
2003; Feldmeyer, 2010; Iceland & Nelson, 2008). In addi-
tion, they will often experience limited opportunities to attain
a quality education (Feldmeyer, 2010; Martinez, 2002;
Sampson & Bean, 2006) and limited housing opportunities
as a result of discriminatory practices (Charles, 2003). Even
within the Hispanic population, there are sub-cultural varia-
tions in terms of levels of segregation (Massey & Denton,
1993) and patterns of migration.
Even though Hispanics do experience more structural dis-
advantage than Whites, they generally experience less than
African Americans. In addition, there is emerging data that
seem to indicate that, unlike the African American popula-
tion, the segregation of Hispanics from Whites, especially
Bisciglia 3
when self-imposed, may serve to mitigate violent victimiza-
tion rather than promote it. This phenomenon has been
dubbed the Latino Paradox (Sampson, 2008; Sampson &
Bean, 2006). The argument becomes that when Hispanics
isolate themselves within an ethnic enclave, the informal
social controls of the community will work to lessen rather
than promote violent victimization. Further segregation may
also work to insulate community members from the negative
effects of poverty and isolation. At the same time, these com-
munities can also fill the role of assimilating new immigrants
(Charles, 2003; Iceland & Nelson, 2008) providing a shared
cultural bond (Feldmeyer, 2009; M. T. Lee, Martinez &
Rosenfeld, 2001; Shihadeh & Barranco, 2010) and providing
economic aid, employment opportunities/information, and
social support all of which may work to lower the rate of
violent crime victimization (Desmond & Kubrin, 2009;
Feldmeyer, 2009; Martinez, 2002; Sampson & Bean, 2006).
Because the concept of the Latino Paradox hinges on a
shared cultural background, one would expect that the segre-
gation of Hispanics may only prove beneficial in situations
where segregation occurs among a single ethnic group rather
than a more diverse representation of Hispanic ethnicities.
The end result becomes that although isolated from Whites,
Hispanics may still thrive in these communities where these
protective factors are more entrenched via the Latino
Paradox (Sampson, 2008; Sampson & Bean, 2006).
To summarize, previous research examining the relation-
ship between minorities and the majority population has gen-
erally shown that the effects of segregation have promoted
higher rates of violent victimization. Such a finding has been
demonstrated in non-racially disaggregated analysis (Hannon
& DeFina, 2005; Messner & South, 1986; Potter, 1991;
Rosenfeld, 1986; Sampson, 1985; South & Felson, 1990;
Velez et al., 2003) as well as within racially disaggregated
data (Shihadeh & Bisciglia, 2008; Shihadeh & Flynn, 1996).
Furthermore, although more macro-structural analyses of
non-African American minority groups have appeared, fur-
ther research is still necessary as Hispanics experience simi-
lar as well as unique structural differences compared with
African American (Charles, 2003; Feldmeyer, 2010; Iceland
& Nelson, 2008). Last, growing research has alluded to the
possibility that unlike African American segregation has
consistently been shown to be associated with rising levels of
violent victimization (Shihadeh & Bisciglia, 2008; Shihadeh
& Flynn, 1996), segregation among the Hispanic population
may actually work to insulate some from lethal violence
(Sampson, 2008; Sampson & Bean, 2006).
Given the body of literature on this topic, two research
expectations are predicted from the forthcoming analysis. It
is predicted that in major U.S. cities, residential segregation
as measured by the index of dissimilarity between Hispanics
and Whites will have a positive effect on rates of Hispanic
homicide victimization. The second hypothesis asserts that
Hispanic segregation as measured by exposure to the White
population will also have a positive association on rates of
Hispanic homicide victimization.
Method
Data Sources
This study examines the expectations presented above
through the use of a city-level analysis within the United
States. Data used for this analysis was taken from three
sources. First, data for the independent variables were drawn
from the U.S. Census Bureau's Summary Tape File 3 (STF3).
Further data regarding segregation (Index of Dissimilarity
and Exposure) were acquired from Census data compiled
and released by the Lewis Mumford Center for Comparative
Urban and Regional Research. This included both the afore-
mentioned segregation indices. The dependent variable
(Hispanic homicide) was drawn from the Centers for Disease
Control's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mor-
tality files. These files are used primarily due to the inconsis-
tency of reporting for Hispanics in the UCR (see Martinez,
1996). To avoid the possibility of year-to-year fluctuations in
homicide rates, a 3-year average will be used bridging the
2000 census (1999, 2000, 2001).
Unit of Analysis
The unit of analysis for this study is cities in the United
States, as this is the most probable location of poverty, crime,
and social disorganization. Using cities with large popula-
tions also allows access to ethnic enclaves that may not be
present in smaller communities. For the purpose of this
study, cities to be included should satisfy two criteria:
(a) They must have a total population of 100,000 or greater
and (b) they must have a Hispanic population of greater than
2,000.1 Based on these criteria, some 236 cities were included
in this analysis.
Dependent Variable (Hispanic Homicide)
The dependent variable is the Hispanic homicide rate. To
examine homicides there are two primary sources that one
may turn to. The first is the UCR, and the second is taken
from the vital statistics data collected by the NCHS. While
the methods of collection differ, research has shown a similar
rate of homicide between the two sources. Data collected by
the NCHS gain its information through the collection and
coding of death certificates from throughout the United
States. Like the UCR, these reports are reliant on the deci-
sions of the individual imputing the original data, in this case
a medical examiner or coroner. While this may be problem-
atic, there is consistency between the two measures (Riedel,
1999). A singular benefit for the use of the UCR over the
mortality files rests on the fact that the UCR may provide
4 SAGE Open
information on the offender as well as the victim; however,
as the majority of homicides are intra-racial, for the purpose
of this study, such a distinction is unnecessary (Martinez,
1996). Because the UCR has not required the collection of
data on Hispanics since 1980 (Martinez & Lee, 1999b), this
analysis will rely on the data taken from the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) Mortality files. In addition, as we are
concerned with Hispanic homicide, data from victimization
sources such as the National Crime Victimization Survey
would not provide this information. Through the use of the
CDC data, information on race/ethnicity of victim, city of
death, and residence can be obtained. To be assured of the
potential structural effects of Hispanic homicides, only
homicides where the residency and occurrence of the homi-
cide were the same are included in this analysis. Due to the
rarity of a homicide event, a 3-year average will be used to
account for possible year to year fluctuations.
Independent Variable (Segregation)
For this analysis segregation will be measured through the
use of the index of dissimilarity, which measures unevenness
(see Massey & Denton, 1988). The index of dissimilarity is
calculated by the following formula:
D
1
2
X A 1
i i
=











 ×
 - 00
where X
i
refers to the proportion of all Hispanics in a
given census tract and A
i
refers to the proportion of Whites in
a given census tract.
The index of dissimilarity is used to assess the segrega-
tion between two groups (in this analysis Hispanics and
Whites). Ranging from 0 to 100, the higher the values, the
greater the segregation between these two groups and the
more residents who would need to relocate from one census
tract to another to produce racial parity across a given city,
the geographic unit of analysis for this study (Shihadeh &
Flynn, 1996; Shryock, Siegel, & Stockwell 1976; Siegel &
Swanson, 2004). In the case of this analysis, as the index of
dissimilarity gets larger, Hispanics and Whites become more
segregated from one another. As a result, it would mean that
members of one group would need to relocate to lower the
overall level of segregation in the city.
In addition to the measure of dissimilarity, this analysis
will measure segregation based on the exposure/isolation
index. This index examines the possible contact that may
exist between group members (Massey & Denton, 1988;
Siegel & Swanson, 2004). This index ranges from 0 to 100,
where lower values indicate a greater degree of isolation
from other groups and higher values indicate that the group
in question resides in areas with different races or ethnicities
(Siegel & Swanson, 2004). The use of this measure offers
insight into the settlement patterns among a specific group.
For example, if the exposure to other groups is relatively
high, this indicates that the minority group under investiga-
tion tends to reside among the reference group. Conversely if
this value is low, then members of the minority group tend to
reside among their own enclaves.
Exposure by means of the interaction index is calculated
by the following formula:
P
X
X
Y
t
i i
i
* =



















where X
i
refers to number of Hispanics in area i (e.g.,
census tract), Y
i
refers to the number of members in the refer-
ence group in a given area (e.g., Whites in a given census
tract), X refers to the total number of Hispanics in the popu-
lation (e.g., city) and t
i
refers to the total population in a
given area (e.g., census tract).
These data were calculated and compiled by the Lewis
Mumford Center using the above-described method. Data
were provided for exposure and dissimilarity scores for 2000
for Hispanics to Whites.
Control Variables
A recurring problem in the research of Hispanics has been
the inconsistency of how this group is measured. This analy-
sis proposes the traditional measure of Hispanics. This mea-
sure follows past studies that identify as individuals whose
national origin is of Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, or one of
any other 20 Spanish-speaking nationalities (Bean & Tienda,
1987; Moore & Pinderhughes, 1993).
A secondary measure of the Hispanic population that will
be used in this analysis is the Hispanic index of qualitative
variation (IQV). This measure indicates the degree of disper-
sion among the various Hispanic ethnicities under investiga-
tion. This analysis breaks Hispanic ethnicities into four
groups, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexicans, and Other
Hispanics. When calculated, the Hispanic IQV produces a
score of 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a greater level of
dispersion of the various Hispanic ethnic groups. For exam-
ple, if the value of a given city's IQV were 0, it would indi-
cate that all members of the Hispanic minority were of a
common ethnicity (e.g., Puerto Rican). Conversely if a city's
Hispanic IQV were 1, then there would be an equal number
of Hispanics in each ethnic classification. Although these
measures seem similar, preliminarily analyses have not
shown a high degree of correlation between the population
counts of Hispanics and the Hispanic IQV. The use of this
measure is unique to previous studies as most have relied
only on a measure of total Hispanic population. I argue that
the use of such a measure is misleading as it fails to capture
the possible lack of social interaction between different
Hispanic nationalities. Furthermore, the use of this measure
will allow us to determine if heterogeneity in the Hispanic
community acts to reinforce traditional roles and social
structures compared with areas where these ethnic enclaves
Bisciglia 5
may not be as pronounced. As stated earlier research has
alluded to the idea that unlike minority groups, such as
African Americans, segregation may work to insulate
Hispanics from the negative effects associated with segrega-
tion (Sampson, 2008; Sampson & Bean, 2006). Such a find-
ing may however be effected by not only the segregation of
Hispanics to the majority population but may also be effected
by the ethnic make-up of the Hispanic population. A measure
such as this allows for an accounting not only of segregation
between racial/ethnic groups but within the Hispanic com-
munity as well.
This analysis utilizes a number of additional control mea-
sures that previous research examining rates of homicide have
used. To control for possible variations in welfare assistance,
which may have an effect on family formation (Shihadeh &
Steffensmeier, 1994), the average level of assistance will be
used. Also, included in this analysis is the average age of the
male population (ethnic specific), as areas with high concen-
trations of youths tend to have higher rates of criminal involve-
ment (Greenberg, 1985; Steffensmeier, Allan, Harer, &
Streifel, 1989). Population size for a given city will also be
calculated as the total number of residences. In addition, race/
ethnic-specific population measures will be used.
Education was also taken into consideration for this anal-
ysis and was reported as the average level of education
attained by the race/ethnic-specific group under investiga-
tion. In addition to education, this analysis also examines
Hispanic unemployment. This analysis uses the percentage
for the Hispanic male population who are unemployed. Tied
to this concept of unemployment are Hispanic male youth
who are considered disengaged from common social institu-
tions. This measure calculates the percentage of Hispanic
males between the ages of 16 and 19 years who are in neither
school nor the military nor the labor force. This analysis will
utilize a gini concentration ratio to determine the inequality
of income for a given city
This study will also control for region with a southwest
dummy variable. The southwest dummy was calculated by
taking all cities considered to be in the southwest of the
United States (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Colorado,
and Texas). The primary reason for this is due to the large
concentration of Hispanics who reside in this area.
To measure housing structure, two measures were consid-
ered. The first measure examined the percentage of homes
within a city that were multi-family dwellings. This was cal-
culated by taking the total number of structures with more
than five units (e.g., apartments) and dividing them by
the total number of housing structures within a community.
The second measure used a calculation of population density.
This was projected as the total number of individuals resid-
ing within a city's geographically defined limits divided by
the total available landmass of the city. An examination of
these measures reported a high level of colinearity between
the two and the latter was included in the forthcoming analy-
sis (see Appendix for a complete correlation matrix for all
variables use in this analysis). The decision to use population
density was due to the increasing number of multi-family
structures that are changing the urban landscape of many
major cities (e.g., town homes and condominiums). Such a
shift represents a change in the traditional concept of low-
income apartment structures that the former measure had
originally been used to for.
Results: Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations for the
measures that were used in this analysis. Based on a sample
of 236 cities, during the 1999 to 2001 period, the average
number of homicides among Hispanics was 7.42 per year
with a standard deviation of 26.38. As a point of comparison,
African American homicides were also calculated in 208 cit-
ies with 100,000 and 2,000 African Americans. An analysis
of these cities indicated that the average number of African
American homicides was 19.76 with a standard deviation of
54.04.
By looking at these two racial/ethnic groups, we can see
that not only do African Americans experience a higher num-
ber of homicides on average, but there is a greater amount of
dispersion in their scores as well. As another point of refer-
ence, when looking at the number of homicide victims
among the White population, the average number of homi-
cides was 6.92 with a standard deviation of 22.69. This result
confirms previous studies that have shown that Hispanics
homicides fall more closely to that of Whites than to African
Americans (Fox & Zawitz, 2001; Logan et al., 2011; Martinez
& Valenzuela, 2006; Peterson & Krivo, 2000; Rennison,
2002).To illustrate the difference in segregation, this analysis
presents two measures of segregation and will discuss them
in relationship to African Americans to give perspective to
the measures for Hispanics. Previous research documents the
influence of African American segregation on a number of
social problems (Sampson, 1987; Shihadeh & Steffensmeier,
1994). This study examined the impact of segregation to
determine if a similar effect exists. To measure segregation,
this study utilized two measures of segregation. The first is
the index of dissimilarity. Among Hispanics on average
34.82% of this population would have to relocate to achieve
an even distribution between Whites and Hispanics. These
values ranged from a minimum of 12.45% to 67.30% with a
standard deviation of 11.91%. In comparison, African
Americans experienced a higher level of segregation than
Hispanics. On average, African Americans exhibit a dissimi-
larity score of 51.11%, more than 15% higher than that of
Hispanics. Furthermore, there is a larger range of dissimilar-
ity for African Americans (17.4% to 97.7% with a standard
deviation of 18.05%). Overall these data demonstrate that
Hispanics experience a lesser degree of segregation than
African Americans.
To further explore the issue of segregation, a measure
based on isolation was also utilized. Isolation or exposure to
6 SAGE Open
other groups is based on the potential that a randomly chosen
individual in the group under investigation (e.g., Hispanics)
will come into contact with a random individual of the refer-
ence group (e.g., Whites; Siegel & Swanson, 2004). Like dis-
similarity, exposure will vary from 0% to 100% where lower
values indicate that the group under investigation is isolated
or lacks exposure to the reference group. Among Hispanics
in large cities, the average exposure was 47.30% with a stan-
dard deviation of 20.11%. This was slightly higher than the
average exposure of African Americans that was 42.30%
with a standard deviation of 21.68%. These findings indicate
that the level of exposure between Hispanics and Whites is
slightly higher than between African Americans and Whites.
When examining segregation on the basis of exposure, the
range for African Americans and Hispanics was almost iden-
tical (1.8%-89.3% for Hispanics and 1.9%-90.6% forAfrican
Americans).
Whether segregation is based on dissimilarity or expo-
sure, these results point to a similar conclusion, namely that
African Americans experience a greater level of segregation
compared with Hispanics. The findings for both of these
measures highlight the importance that segregation may
have on both populations. Although Hispanics do experience
a lesser amount of segregation, it may in part explain why
their rates of homicide, although not as high as African
Americans, remain higher than that of Whites.
Results: Multivariate Statistics
One question that has surrounded the literature concerning
homicides has been the influence of negative disadvantages
(e.g., segregation, poverty, lack of education, etc.) on minor-
ity groups as it relates to homicide. This section will examine
the disadvantage of segregation on two separate dimensions.
The first looks at segregation based on the index of dissimi-
larity (unevenness) while the second measures segregation
on the basis of exposure (potential contact).
The first model of Table 2 examines the influence of seg-
regation through the use of the index of dissimilarity. These
findings show a strong positive association between segrega-
tion among Hispanics and Whites and the number of Hispanic
homicides. Based on the these results, we find that for every
one standard deviation increase in Hispanic/White segrega-
tion, there is a 144.31% increase in the number of homi-
cides.2 This finding highlights the negative impact of
segregation on Hispanics. This analysis also looks at the
effect of ethnic isolation to see if it affects the number of
homicides. Based on the findings of this analysis, the IQV,
used to measure the dispersion of Hispanic ethnicities, indi-
cates that no significant association exists. Based on these
findings, a concentration of a single Hispanic ethnicity did
not increase or decrease the number of Hispanic homicides.
Table 2 also presents the results of the analysis for
Hispanics for a variety of control measures. These findings
demonstrate that a variety of control measures significantly
impact the number of homicides that occur among Hispanics.
Within this community housing costs show a negative asso-
ciation with homicides. As the median rent for Hispanics
decreases by a single standard deviation, there is a 35.47%
increase in the number of homicides. Interestingly, among
Hispanics income inequality does not significantly impact
the number of homicides. Among Hispanics regionalism is
also associated with homicides, where individuals residing in
the southwest experienced a higher number of homicides
compared with those in non-Southwestern regions of the
United States. Finally, factors such as education and age are
significant in this model. Educational attainment was found
to lower homicides among Hispanics (3.76% for each stan-
dard deviation increase in education). Also, as the average
age of the male population decreases homicides increase.
The second model presented in Table 2 analyses the
impact of segregation on homicide using the measure of
exposure. Exposure, like dissimilarity, is significantly asso-
ciated with Hispanic homicide. In this case the association
was negative, meaning that as Hispanics become more iso-
lated within their own enclaves the number of homicides
increased. For each standard deviation decrease in the expo-
sure of Hispanics to Whites, the number of homicides
increased by 27.51%. Regardless of which measure is used,
the impact of segregation is clear, namely that segregation
from the majority group has a negative outcome on the
minority group.
The findings of the second model were generally consis-
tent with the first model, with a few exceptions. First, in this
model income inequality does show a statistically significant
association to the number of homicides that occur. Second,
unlike in the previous model Hispanic female-headed house-
holds were significantly associated with Hispanic homicide.

Finally, in the exposure model, Hispanic males who are unat-
tached to social institutions (disengaged) are also positively
associated with homicide.
Discussion and Conclusion
Based on a review of the literature on the subject of segrega-
tion and lethal violence, two hypotheses were predicted. The
results of an analysis using negative binomial regression
models on a 236-city sample was implemented to test these
expectations. The first hypothesis asserted that increased
segregation, measured by the index of dissimilarity, between
Hispanics and Whites would result in higher instances of
homicide. The results of this analysis were confirmed in the
regression model, indicating that for each standard deviation
increase in the index of dissimilarity resulted in a corre-
sponding 144.31% increase in Hispanic homicide. Such a
finding seems in line with previous research concerning seg-
regation and homicide.
The second expectation of this study asserted that poten-
tial exposure (or isolation) would impact rates of Hispanic
homicide. In this case, it was predicted that as Hispanics
became more isolated from the majority population (Whites),
the rates of homicide would increase, or that as they became
more exposed to the majority group rates of homicide would
go down. Results indicated that as exposure decreased
(Hispanics became more isolated from Whites) homicides
increased by 27.51%.
Theoretically, this research demonstrates that many of the
structural factors that serve to disorganize metropolitan com-
munities (e.g., income inequality, segregation, poverty, etc.)
are shown to have an affect on members of the Hispanic
community in a similar fashion as they affect African
Americans. The findings of this analysis follow the consen-
sus of previous research specifically in showing that segrega-
tion (measured in both manners) between the majority group
and Hispanics is associated with rising homicide rates
(Charles, 2003; M. R. Lee, 2000; Parker & Pruitt, 2000;
Shihadeh & Flynn, 1996; Shihadeh & Maume, 1997;
Shihadeh & Bisciglia, 2008). Even though Hispanics experi-
ence a lower number of homicide victimizations thanAfrican
Americans (Logan et al., 2011; Martinez & Valenzuela,
2006), many of the same structural components that are asso-
ciated with African American homicides had similar effects
among this group. Such findings lend support to the concept
that structural elements within urban communities as corre-
lated with segregation are likely to affect any potential num-
ber of minority groups.
Notwithstanding, in recent years, a growing body of lit-
erature has asserted that among Hispanics, segregation may
actually work to buffer violent crime rather than promote it
(Sampson, 2008; Sampson & Bean, 2006). Although this
analysis finds support for the link between segregation and
Hispanic homicide, there are specific limitations. It has been
suggested that the effect of self-segregation may be benefi-
cial in specific Hispanic communities, namely those that

support a single ethnicity or in communities with a legacy of
migration (Shihadeh & Barranco, 2010). Future analysis
may seek to tease out this possible variation by distinguish-
ing those urban spaces that have established patterns of
migration from those that are representative of new migra-
tory destinations and therefore are less likely to be represen-
tative of strong community cohesion and social control.
Subsequent analyses may also want to take into account
the dispersion of Hispanic ethnicities within a community.
The logic being, the more homogeneous Hispanics are within
a community (concentrated into a single ethnicity), the
higher the probability that members will interact with one
another. Simply put, classification as Hispanic may not be
enough to warrant meaningful contact with other Hispanics,
instead a reliance on a more nuanced Hispanic identification
may be necessary. As a direction for future analysis, such a
distinction may show support for the Latino Paradox as pre-
sented by Sampson & Bean (2006) that the measures in this
analysis failed to demonstrate.
Although the levels of segregation among the Hispanic
population are less than those among African Americans, the
results of this study point to a similar outcome as the litera-
ture on African Americans, simply that when segregated
from the majority group of the population potential lethal
victimization increases among the minority group. The find-
ings of this study support some previous work regarding seg-
regation and violent crime, while also demonstrating that the
causal macro-social factors that lead to Hispanic homicide
may differ from other racial/ethnic groups (Feldmeyer, 2010;
Martinez, 1996). For this reason, explanations of violent
crime that are applied to African Americans may not be ser-
viceable for to Hispanics. With a rapidly growing Hispanic
population, understanding these causes is paramount to
develop effect crime control policies and community-based
programs to address violent crime.
Overall, the major limitation of this analysis is one that
is all too often present among the research concerning
Hispanics and that is the lack of distinction between the
various Hispanic ethnicities. Although the U.S. Census col-
lects data on more than 20 different Hispanic groups,
researchers are often likely to place them into a monolithic
category, treating these groups as though they have a com-
mon ethnic history to draw from, which would equally
influence their structural characteristics and chances of
criminal victimization (Bean & Tienda, 1987). Research
has clearly shown that among the largest Hispanic ethnici-
ties (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans), there are vast
differences in terms of their structural location in society,
patterns of settlement, and socioeconomic status. Although
this study did examine Hispanics as an entire population,
one improvement over previous studies was the incorpora-
tion of the Hispanic IQV measure that allowed for an analy-
sis of the impact of the dispersion of the various Hispanic
groups across a given city. Notwithstanding future macro-
level studies should incorporate an ethnic-specific exami-
nation of larger Hispanic ethnic groups.
In summation, these findings demonstrate that segrega-
tion, measured as either the index of dissimilarity or expo-
sure, as well as other macro-social indicators of community
disorganization impact Hispanics in a manner that is consis-
tent not only with previous research on Hispanics but with a
similar body of research on African Americans as well. This
as well as other findings of this analysis support the presence
of a macro-link between segregation and homicide among
Hispanics. Beyond conforming findings of previous research
this study also deepens the macro-social understanding of
Hispanic homicide victimization through the addition of its
Hispanic IQV measure that has in effect provided an internal
measure of segregation among Hispanics within these com-
munities. Although this analysis failed to demonstrate a sig-
nificant association of this measure, future analysis that is
more focused on specific Hispanic communities or patterns
of immigration may show that such a measure is more pre-
dictive of homicide victimization.

Notes
1. As a sensitivity analysis, models were also created that used
thresholds of 5,000 and 10,000 for the group under investiga-
tion. Findings of these analyses were consistent with the mod-
els reported in the forthcoming analysis.
2. To interpret a negative binomial coefficient, the following for-
mula is used {[(exp( × s)) - 1] × 100}. By taking the exponent
of the product of the coefficient and the standard deviation of
the independent variable, subtracted from 1 and multiplied by
100, the output allows for an interpretation of a percent change
in the dependent variable for a one unit change in the indepen-
dent variable (see M. R. Lee & Bartkowski, 2004).
