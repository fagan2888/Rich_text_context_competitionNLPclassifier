Abstract
Objectives: To use blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
evaluate renal oxygenation in patients with primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS), and test the
hypothesis that renal tissue oxygenation correlates with renal function, tubulointerstitial
alterations and treatment response.
Methods: Patients with untreated first-onset PNS and healthy control subjects underwent BOLD
MRI. Blood and urine samples were obtained on the day of MRI, and patients underwent renal
biopsy the day after MRI. Renal tubulointerstitial damage scores (TIDS) were determined using
Katafuchi criteria. All patients received corticosteroids within 7 days after MRI and were followed
up for 12 months.
Results: Medullary R2* values were significantly lower in patients with PNS (n ¼ 20) than controls
(n ¼ 18). Medullary R2* values were negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration
rates and positively correlated with TIDS in patients with PNS. There were no significant
differences in medullary or cortical R2* values when patients were classified according to
treatment response.

Introduction
Primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS) is
caused by several types of glomerular dis-
ease, with or without concomitant renal
tubulointerstitial injury, and is characterized
by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia,
oedema and hyperlipidaemia. PNS is usually
treated with corticosteroids, but some
patients do not respond to treatment and
eventually progress to end-stage renal fail-
ure. Glomerular pathology is a crucial prog-
nostic factor in PNS, with concomitant
tubulointerstitial damage recognized as a
significant factor contributing to poor prog-
nosis.1 Since oxygenation abnormalities are
a primary cause of (and unifying mechanism
for) progression to tubulointerstitial fibro-
sis,2 a suitable noninvasive and reproducible
method for evaluating changes in intrarenal
oxygenation may aid in assessing tubuloin-
terstitial alterations and predicting progno-
sis. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is such a
technique.
The basic principle of BOLD MRI is that
magnetic field perturbations (caused by
paramagnetic molecules such as deoxyhae-
moglobin) lead to a loss of phase coherence
and signal attenuation in gradient echo T2*
weighted sequences. The R2* (1/T2*) relax-
ivity rate of spin dephasing is proportional
to tissue deoxyhaemoglobin levels,3,4 and
changes in R2* can be interpreted as
changes in oxygen partial pressure (pO2
) in
tissues.5,6 BOLD MRI has been shown to
give reproducible results in oxygenation
monitoring in normal kidneys,7,8 and has
been used to detect renal oxygenation
changes in hypertensive disease,3 diabetes,9
transplanted kidneys10 and acute renal
ischaemia.11
The aim of the present study was to use
BOLD MRI to evaluate renal oxygenation
in patients with PNS, in order to test
the hypothesis that renal tissue oxygen-
ation correlates with renal function,
tubulointerstitial alterations and treatment
response.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited sequential patients with
PNS, admitted to the Department of
Nephrology, the First Affiliated Hospital,
College of Medicine, Zhejiang University,
Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, between
January 2012 and December 2013.
Inclusion criteria were: (i) initial onset of
PNS; (ii) no prior corticosteroid therapy; (iii)
no history of other kidney disease, hyperten-
sion, diabetes or other vascular disease; (iv)
availability of follow-up data. Healthy con-
trol subjects with no history of renal disease,
hypertension, diabetes or other vascular dis-
ease were recruited from individuals
undergoing health examination at the
Medical Examination Centre, the First
Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine,
Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang,
China. Participants with contraindications
Zhang et al. 357
to MRI (such as claustrophobia) were
excluded.
The study protocol was approved by the
Medical Ethics Committee of the First
Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine,
Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang,
China, and all participants provided written
informed consent prior to enrolment.
MRI protocol and analysis
In order to standardize hydration status and
sodium balance, all participants were nil by
mouth and received no intravenous transfu-
sion 4 h prior to MRI. In addition, no
diuretic agents were taken 12 h prior to
MRI.12 MRI was performed using a 3 T
clinical system (Signa HDxÕ, GE Medical
systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an
eight-channel body coil. After conventional
coronal, axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted
imaging, BOLD MRI was acquired with a
gradient-recalled-echoes sequence. A total of
five coronal sections centred at the renal
hilum were scanned with section thickness of
5 mm and intersection gap of 1 mm. Each
section corresponded to 16 different gradient
echoes and was acquired during a 15-s breath
hold (echo times 1.6, 6.66, 11.72, 16.78,
21.84, 26.9, 31.96, 37.02, 42.08, 47.14, 52.2,
57.26, 62.32, 67.38, 72.44 and 77.5 ms). Scan
parameters were repetition time 150 ms, flip
angle 30, bandwidth Æ 31.25 kHz, FOV
35 cm, and matrix 128 Â 128.
Imaging analysis of BOLD data was
performed interactively using research soft-
ware (FuncToolÕ 2, GE Healthcare) at the
workstation (GE ADW 4.4, Sun
Microsystems, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
R2* maps of the kidney were automatically
generated, and each map was delineated by
two experienced radiologists (R.Z. and Q-
D.W.) who were blinded to clinical data.
Radiologists worked together and with con-
sensus. For the R2* map, three coronal
sections centred at the hilum of each kidney
were selected. A total of three regions of
interest (ROIs; 0.45 Æ 0.04 cm2 ) at the
upper, middle, and lower parts of the
kidney were traced in the cortex and medulla
of each section, carefully avoiding renal
sinus and susceptibility artefacts. In total,
R2* values of nine cortical and nine medul-
lary ROIs were collected per kidney
(Figure 1), and the mean of these 18 cortical
R2* and medullary R2* values was
calculated.
Laboratory analyses
Peripheral blood and urine samples were
obtained from each participant on the day of
the MRI. Analyses included haemoglobin,
total serum protein, serum albumin, serum
creatinine, urinary protein and estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; calculated
by the ModiEcation of Diet in Renal Disease
equation).13
Renal pathology
Patients underwent renal biopsy the day
after MRI, and biopsy specimens were pro-
cessed for light, immunoFuorescent, and
electron microscopies. Formalin-fixed speci-
mens were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin, periodic acid­Schiff stain, periodic
acid silver methenamine and Masson's tri-
chrome. Consecutive frozen sections were
stained with direct immunoFuorescence
using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-
labelled murine monoclonal antibodies
(Dako, Denmark) for Immunoglobulin
(Ig)G, IgA, IgM, C3, C4 and C1q.
Formalin-fixed and frozen sections were
examined via light microscopy.
Electron microscopy of two glomeruli per
patient was performed to observe epithelial
foot process fusion, electron dense deposits,
and thickness of the glomerular basement
membrane and tubuloreticular structures.
Pathological grading (Katafuchi criteria14)
of renal tubulointerstitial damage was per-
formed independently by two experienced

pathologists, and agreement was reached by
consensus if necessary. The total score (0­
9) includes three components: interstitial
inflammatory cell infiltration (0­3),
interstitial fibrosis (0­3), and tubular atro-
phy (0­3).
Follow-up
Within 7 days after MRI scan, all patients
received the initial adequate dose (1mg/kg
per day) of prednisone, orally. Prednisone
was gradually withdrawn over the following
8 weeks according to the individual needs of
the patient. Patients received immunosup-
pressant therapy (cyclophosphamide, trip-
terygium or tacrolimus) as required. All
patients were followed up for 12 months. If
proteinuria resolved during the initial 8
weeks of treatment and did not return
during the remaining 12 months of follow-
up, the patient was defined as a treatment
responder. Treatment nonresponders were
defined as those patients whose proteinuria
remained during the initial 8 weeks of
treatment. Treatment-dependent patients
were defined as those whose proteinuria
disappeared during the initial 8 weeks of
treatment but relapsed during the remaining
12 months of follow-up.
Statistical analyses
The study sample size was determined to be
20 patients, according to the findings of an
earlier study.10 Data were mean Æ SD.
Paired samples t-test was used to compare
coronal R2* and medullary R2* between the
right and the left kidneys; independent
samples t-test was used to compare coronal
R2* and medullary R2* between patients
and controls. Patients were stratified into
subgroups according to PNS pathological
type and treatment response, and between-
subgroup differences in coronal R2* and
medullary R2* were analysed using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Spearman's
correlation coefficient analysis was used to
evaluate relationships between clinical,
laboratory and pathological variables
and R2*. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSSÕ version 16.0 (SPSS

Results
The study included 20 patients with PNS
(eleven male/nine female; mean age
39.15 Æ 14.58 years; age range 18­66 years)
and 18 control subjects (nine male/nine
female; mean age 41.39 Æ 17.61 years; age
range 19­69 years). There were no significant
between-group differences in age or sex.
Renal pathology and tubulointerstitial
damage scores (TIDS) were determined in
18 patients (two patients refused biopsy).
Seven patients (38.9%) had membranous
nephropathy; five (27.8%) had mesangial
proliferative glomerulonephritis; three
(16.7%) had minimal change disease; one
(5.6%) had focal segmental glomerulosclero-
sis; and two (11.1%) had mesangiocapillary
glomerulonephritis. TIDS scores were 0 in
three patients (16.7%), 1­3 in 11 patients
(61.1%), 4­6 in four patients (22.2%), and 7­
9 in one patient (5.6%). A total of seven
patients were classified as treatment
responders, eight were nonresponders and
five were treatment dependent.
There were no significant differences
between the right and left kidney in cortical
or medullary R2* in controls or patients (data
not shown). There was no significant differ-
ence between patients and controls in cortical
R2* values (20.41Æ 3.92sÀ1 and 19.71 Æ
0.66sÀ1, respectively). Medullary R2*
values were significantly lower in patients
than controls, however (23.97Æ 5.89sÀ1 vs
36.54 Æ 1.34sÀ1; P < 0.001).
There was a significant positive correl-
ation between tubulointerstitial damage
score and medullary R2* in patients with
PNS (r ¼ 0.809, P < 0.001; Figure 2A). As
shown in Figure 2B, there was a significant
negative correlation between eGFR and
medullary R2* in patients with PNS
(r ¼ À0.462, P ¼ 0.040). There were no sig-
nificant correlations between any other
laboratory parameters (haemoglobin, total
protein, serum albumin, serum creatinine
and urine protein) and either medullary or
cortical R2*values.
There were no significant between-group
differences in medullary or cortical R2*

Discussion
This study demonstrated that medullary
R2* values were significantly lower in
patients with PNS than in healthy control
subjects, indicating an increased medullary
oxygen concentration in PNS, which is
consistent with reports on many chronic
renal diseases.10,15­17,18 Oxygenation of the
kidney was determined by the balance
between oxygen supply and consumption.
The increased medullary oxygen content in
patients may suggest that the reduction of
renal oxygen consumption (as a result of the
known reduced tubular fractional reabsorp-
tion of sodium) may influence the change in
oxygen concentration.19,20
Consistent with the findings of others,21
medullary R2* values were negatively asso-
ciated with eGFR in patients with PNS in
the present study, indicating that BOLD
MRI reflects renal function. The absence of
correlation between R2* values and serum
creatinine in the present study may be
explained by the fact that this parameter is
affected by extrarenal factors including age,
weight, diet and drug use.22 Our finding of a
significant positive correlation between
medullary R2* and TIDS is compatible
with the findings of others,21 and suggests
that BOLD MRI may reflect the degree of
tubulointerstitial changes.
Although medullary R2* values
increased with more advanced kidney
damage (low eGRF/high TIDS) in patients
with PNS in the present study, mean medul-
lary R2* values were significantly lower than
those in healthy controls. This may be due to
the effect of reduced blood supply (as a
result of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and the
loss of peritubular capillaries) lowering
medullary oxygenation in patients with ser-
ious tubulointerstitial lesions.
The present study found no statistically
significant relationship between treatment
response and R2* values. Prognostic factors
in PNS are complex; with severe tubuloin-
terstitial damage recognized as a major
contributing factor for poor prognosis.23
Prognosis may also be affected by fac-
tors including glomerular pathological
type, although we found no significant
between-group differences in R2* values
when patients were classified according to
disease type.
This study has several limitations, includ-
ing the small sample size. Future studies
should include larger patient groups. In
addition, we performed BOLD MRI only
once for each patient. Renal oxygenation is
a dynamic characteristic that is influenced
by a number of local and systemic factors,
and may vary at different disease stages.24
Dynamic monitoring of renal oxygenation
changes with noninvasive BOLD MRI
would be useful throughout treatment.
BOLD MRI may provide useful informa-
tion for assessing the effect of pharmaco-
logical interventions and adjusting
medication regimens.
In conclusion, the medullary oxygen con-
centration was higher in patients with PNS
than in control subjects. BOLD MRI was a
useful noninvasive method for the evalu-
ation of renal function and tubulointerstitial
impairment.
