Introduction
One major concern of both residents and policy makers in
postconflict communities is economic revitalization and
sociophysical development of the affected areas (Collier,
2003; Collier & Hoeffler, 2002; Narman & Vidanapathirana,
2005; Reinikka & Collier, 2001; Short, 2003). This can be
accomplished through funding from the central purse, self-
help, or external support. The fourth is the hybrid of two or
more of the earlier mentioned approaches. Studies have
shown that governments in conflict-affected regions of
developing nations are poor and apathetic toward postcon-
flict reconstruction (Do & Lakshmi, 2007; Ikejiaku, 2009;
Luckham, 2011). This makes many of them to look outward
for assistance from foreign nations and nongovernmental
institutions. Postconflict development through external sup-
port is not bad. This is because it exerts no initial economic
responsibility on recipients. However, it may have long-term
negative effects of loan refund, lack of self-dependency, and
delayed internal fund generating motivation in low-income
countries.
Self-help, an inward looking strategy, may have its initial
challenges but it encourages the people who are concerned to
attend to their needs, and by this means, they develop self-moti-
vated economic sustainability. The commitment of residents in
conflict areas to self-motivated approach makes development
through self-help to be more sustainable than depending on
external aids from nonconflict regions. At the long run, such
self-reliance approach will also positively influence the eco-
nomic and sociophysical well-being of conflict-affected resi-
dents. Such positive effect may have its spatial dimension over
times, sometimes spreading beyond the postconflict communi-
ty's boundaries.
This study was centered on the inward motivated school
of thought. It perceived community-based institutions as
self-help initiatives toward socioeconomic and physical
development of communities, especially in areas that have
just emerged from conflicts. Literature has shown that com-
munity-based organizations (CBOs) have proved their rele-
vance in the local socioeconomic and physical developments
of either conflict or nonconflict zones of lagging regions of
the world (Ogundipe, 2003; Onibokun & Faniran, 1995;

Accomplishment Index Analysis of the
Sociophysical Activities of Community-
Based Organizations in a Postconflict
Area of Africa
Albert Ayorinde Abegunde1
Abstract
Postconflict redevelopment in Africa is noted for low government support but it is well concerned with self-help initiatives.
The study determined the accomplishment level of such self-help initiatives in a postconflict community in Nigeria through
primary and secondary data collection (n = 120) on the sociophysical activities of their community-based organizations
(CBOs). These CBOs drew members from and executed projects within their immediate environment. They generated
funds internally to finance essential projects to residents after the conflicts. Their activities toward security of lives and
property, public infrastructure, credit facilities, and social development provisions to residents were perceived as accomplished
unlike leadership training they offered to key leaders and moral and spiritual supports they rendered to their members. Since
these CBOs were formed by residents who were neighbors, operated within their immediate locality, and accomplished
more on essential postconflict sociophysical projects, they served as a team-pointer to bottom-up approach in postconflict
sociophysical peace-building through self-help initiatives.

Onyeozu, 2010). This is so because they embark on self-help
projects that are undertaken through voluntary efforts and
utilize meager local resources to meet community's needs
that are either of small- or large-scale dimensions. What this
means is that CBOs place an emphasis on joint efforts; they
organize members for identification of their needs. They also
embark on projects that meet these communities' needs and
maximize reliance on local initiatives and resources. Thus,
CBOs make an active participation of individuals and corpo-
rate groups at grassroots a nucleus of sustainable develop-
ment (Onyeozu, 2010). Over the years, these characteristics
have given popularity to the organizations among local resi-
dents in developing countries (Barr, Dekker, & Fafchamps,
2010; Ekman, 2004; Molyneux, Hutchison, Chuma, &
Gilson, 2007; Roe, Nelson, & Sandbrook, 2009).
The activities of CBOs in developing nations, especially
in Africa where many governments have failed to sustain
development of their local communities, have been reviewed
in the literature (Agbola, 2002; Onyeozu, 2010). As opined
by Cernea (1984), CBOs are local initiatives and resilience
to failure of the central government. In another dimension, it
is perceived as the bottom-up approach by the residents to
cater for the shortcomings of top-town strategy by the gov-
ernment. The economic contributions of CBOs to develop-
ment at the district level in developing countries have also
been well considered in the literature (Barr et al., 2010;
Larsson, Fuller, & Pletsch, 2012; MacPherson, 1995; Onyx
& Bullen, 2000; Roe et al., 2009), but few works on their
sociophysical effects are available in Africa, especially in
conflict affected zones. Some of the past studies have
focused on the impacts of CBOs at local level on agricul-
tural development (Zurayk, 2010), physical aspect of com-
munities (Bradshaw, 2006), the economy (Abegunde, 2009),
social services' provision (Katungi & Akankwasa, 2010),
and the activities of nongovernmental institutions (Onyeozu,
2010) among others. Others like Biddle and Biddle (1968),
Narayan (1995), Onibokun and Faniran (1995), Agbola
(1998), and Abegunde (2004) linked CBOs with sustainable
development, housing, local potentials and initiatives, and
rural development, respectively. None of these past studies
have been able to determine the level of sociophysical
achievement made by CBOs in a conflict-affected area of
sub-Saharan Africa. This gap was what the current study
intended to fill.
One of the recent studies that were based on CBOs in
Africa was carried out by Sangole, Kaaria, Njuki, Lewa, and
Mapila (2014). The work measured the social capital, func-
tioning, and accountability of farmers' organization in
Kenya, based on people's participation. The author noted
that farmer groups that integrated community driven partici-
patory monitoring and evaluation had higher indexes for
group social capital and performance with greater group
cohesion while their members had higher satisfaction with
group performance. The work, however, focused only on
agro-based organization and did not expatiate on both its
social and physical activities. It also lacked a spatial dimen-
sion. In addition, it was not based on the conflict affected
economy. Hence, it could not have measured the achieve-
ment of such organization in a postconflict environment.
Along this line, C. Claudia, Mincemoyer, and Perkins (2005)
measured the impact of youth development programs, based
on online youth life skills evaluation system using the
achievement test. This work was Internet based with no
physical geographical scope and so it was not concerned of
sociophysical activities of CBOs in the built environment.
The result of the work also centered on providing database
where youths could access online information in a digital
Internet community where there is no physical conflict that
has resulted in community economic regression. Such
online-based study could not have suggested the level of
achievement made by CBOs that are location based. It could
not also have revealed the spatial extent of the sociophysical
facilities provided by CBOs in the study area.
Some other related past studies used residents'perceptions
to explain the impacts of CBOs on important and sensitive
areas of the environment like housing (J. Claudia, 2003; The
Urban Institute & Vidal, 2001), infrastructure (Mardirosian,
2010), governance (Cavaye, 2004), depressed economy
(Abegunde, 2011), and disaster and conflict management
(Fischer, 2006; Haider, 2009) among others. Although these
are social and physical issues in the community, but the
impact studies were not conflict related.
The commonality of conflicts inAfrica, the current wave of
advocacy for an inward looking strategy in postconflict socio-
physical development, and the recent springing up of CBOs in
the region have all pointed to the need for a relevant new study
of this kind (Dimelu, Salua, & Igbokwe, 2013; Haider, 2009;
Khwairakpam, Shankar, & Mukherjee, 2014). The current
study therefore positioned Ile Ife, a city that has just emerged
from communal conflict in sub-SaharanAfrica as a case study.
Such a specific study was not common in the region. Previous
works on CBOs in the region (Abegunde, 2003;Agbola, 1988)
were all silent on their level of accomplishment and were not
carried out on postconflict communities.
The present study contributed to knowledge by providing
information on the sociophysical operations of CBOs in a
postconflict environment and justified this by the level of
achievement they attained in the course of exerting their
influences within a geographic scope. In the course of con-
ducting the current study, interests were drawn to the socio-
economic and physical characteristics of these CBOs. These
include their nature of operations, years of establishment,
conditions of membership, sources and modes of fund gen-
eration, types of objectives they set and levels of their accom-
plishment on sociophysical projects, and the spatial extent of
these within their geographic space. Such information could
assist in establishing the CBOs' thresholds and by this pro-
vide a basis for determining the success rate of their social
and physical supports that they offered to residents in the
study area.

The Literature
Community-Based Organization
CBO is also known as local organization, community devel-
opment, neighborhood council, and united community
among others across the nations of the world (Abegunde,
2009).Another institution that seems to be closer to it at local
level is the nongovernmental organization (NGO). However,
a distinction between CBOs and NGOs is that the former
suggest simple institutions that cover a relatively small area
with a local identity while NGOs have a sophisticated and
complex structure and cover a wider area and project, though
with a concern for local communities (Agbola, 1998).
Community Development Associations and Their
Sociophysical Dimension
Studies on social and economic implications of community
development associations abound in the literature (Abegunde,
2009; Kassahun, 2011; Mgawanyemba, 2008; Opara, 2010;
Twombly, De Vita, & Garrick, 2000). Other works on their
physical and spatial effects also exist but these studies were
carried out by scholars who are located outside the region of
Africa (Downey, 2006; Nikkhah & Redzuan, 2009; Wu &
Tsai, 2008). Paradoxically, CBOs' physical development
impacts have been felt long ago among indigenous settlers in
many traditional communities in Africa (Adebisi, 2009; Ayo,
2002; Oyerinde, 2005), especially in Nigeria where this
study was based (Holdcroft, 1982; Olowu, Ayo, & Akande,
1991). Such physical impact was felt through self-help hous-
ing construction (Agbola, 1998), infrastructural provision
and sustenance (Agbola, 1988), farming (Adeyemo, 2002),
and development of public centers for community use
(Narayan, 1995) among others. In community development
planning, the physical operation of CBOs has its spatial
dimension. The argument here is that all social, economic,
and physical impacts of CBOs in any given community are
within a geographic space, spatially concentrated or dis-
persed. However, most of these past studies have failed to
link the physical attributes and activities of CBOs with their
spatial effects. Attempts to achieve this has made the present
study to determine the accomplishment level of the social
and physical activities of the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria, with a
spatial perspective on the postconflict community. This was
carried out to confirm the assertion that CBOs as local insti-
tutions are formed mainly by residents who are living within
an immediate environment and that their operations are best
enjoyed in the immediate neighborhood of the CBOs' exis-
tence (Adebisi, 2009; Blunt & Warren, 1996; Glaser, 1986;
Hasenfeld & Gidron, 1993). In addition, the current study
was carried out to confirm if this also applied to conflict-
affected areas of developing nations or not. It also aimed at
determining the commitments of such CBOs to residents'
sociophysical and economic well-being and the reconstruc-
tion of their community, even after crises.
Accomplishment Index (AI)
AI as used in this study is a method of determining success
or attainment level of a group based on the aim it sets to
accomplish. This is computed by attaching scores that are
having rated values (in ordinal form) to performance indexes
under each of the CBOs' set objectives. The AI in this study
was referenced to the work of Likert (1932). The author
developed Likert-type scale of performance rating, using
scales 1 to 5. The scale with the lowest rate was counted as
having the least score and vice versa, though in an ordinal
format (Afon, 2006). This AI also has its roots in (but not
exactly the same as) the achievement index that was pro-
pounded by an educationist named Valen Johnson of the
Institute of Statistics and Decisions at Duke University who
first developed the model to calculate grade point average
(GPA) of students to appraise their academic accomplish-
ments (Embretson & Reise, 2000; V. E. Johnson, 1997).
According to V. E. Johnson (1997), achievement index is a
measure of a student's performance, relative to all other stu-
dents taking classes at the institution. Since then, achieve-
ment index has become one of the statistical methods used to
solve problems relating to students' GPA. Researchers who
have used the test in recent times include Lehman and Geller
(2004), Odeck (2004), P. C. Gordon, Perrin, Sancar, and
Stewart (2007), Boiche and Sarrazin (2008), Uthman (2009),
and Flateby (2014) among others. Flateby (2014) applied
this model in Georgia University and concluded that it could
be used to ascertain students' level of learning within a
course, in a major, or across their entire undergraduate
education.
According to V. E. Johnson (1997), three basic principles
of achievement index must be followed to arrive at a mean-
ingful conclusion (V. E. Johnson, 2003). First, students'
grades in courses must provide minimal performance in ordi-
nal information and not necessarily in an absolute term. This
will help the researcher to categorize respondents (students)
into groups that are receiving the same grade and to rank
these groups relative to other groups. Second, the ordinal
information on grades obtained is used to make a summary
score which indicates each student's academic performance
relative to the performance of other students. By this means,
the pattern of all grades in all classes is determined. The third
assumption is that consequences of the test must be explicitly
spelt out before a conclusion is drawn.
AI in this study borrowed knowledge from these assump-
tions and used Likert-type scale (Afon, 2006) ratings of
numbers 1 to 5 to rate respondents' (CBOs heads) scores on
the social and physical activities of CBOs in the study area.
This fulfills the first principle of achievement index which
claims that there is the need for ordinal information to cate-
gorize respondents into groups that are receiving the same
score and to rank those groups relative to other groups.
In this study, AI was developed from the combination of
pieces of information extracted from Likert-type scale
4 SAGE Open
(Likert, 1932) and achievement index (V. E. Johnson, 2003).
This was used to determine the levels of success of main
tasks and projects that were set to be accomplished by the
CBOs within the past one decade in the study area. In line
with the third assumption of achievement index of V. E.
Johnson (1997), the level of success recorded or observed in
the sociophysical activities of the CBOs in the study area
was established.
Method for the Study
The Case Study
Ile Ife was chosen as the case study for this work. It is a tra-
ditional city and it is located in Southwestern Nigeria. Past
studies revealed that the study area and its peripheral regions
have records of CBOs' operations (Abegunde, 2009; Ayinde
& Torimiro, 2014), despite the protracted intercommunal
conflicts that had affected the community for decades
(Albert, 2001). The city is the most civilized part of a country
that has the highest population in sub-Saharan Africa (World
Bank, 2014). It is made up of two local government areas.
These are Ife East and Ife Central Local Government Areas,
whose headquarters are at Oke-Ogbo and Ajebandele,
respectively. The two local governments consist of 21 politi-
cal wards in the council areas with a population of 355,818
people (Sáenz, Embrick, & Rodríguez, 2009). This city is
situated on Latitude 70.28°N and Longitude 40.34°E with an
annual rainfall of 0.6 m which encourages farming of variety
of crops (Ajala & Olayiwola, 2013). The city has one lan-
guage (Yoruba) that promotes understanding among resi-
dents. This made the study area to conform to the general
morphology of a traditional settlement, having a common
culture and other forms of social attributes. These encourage
a social interaction and also enhance a joint contribution
toward fulfillment of a common goal. This could be why
CBOs are common and age-long in the region (Ayo, 2002).
Such homogeneous cultural attribute was expected to
gender unity rather than conflicts among residents. The
reverse was the case in the study area. This is because two
distinct groups of settlers are known to coexist in the city for
centuries. Each of the group of these distinct two settlers has
a local dialect commonly spoken within respective neighbor-
hoods of each settlement. These two groups are the Ifes and
the Modakekes (Akinjogbin, 1996). The former people were
said to be the early settlers while the latter were said to be in
the minority and were accommodated by the former, based
on the consent of the forefathers of the Ifes who gave sepa-
rate land to the Modakekes for farming while the minority
group paid tributes to the host. Over time, the Modakekes
multiplied and expanded and as expected, they have to claim
the land given to them by the Ifes as their territory (Albert,
1999). The Nigeria Land Use Act of 1978 also supported
such claim. The sociocultural difference between the two
distinct settlers was easy to manage by the residents before
and after Nigeria's independence until the country gave spe-
cial attention to local government system that encouraged
grassroots development. Thus, lack of generally accepted
formula to share political proceeds in the city as touching the
two distinct settlers led to prolonged hostilities that escalated
into communal conflicts (Albert, 2001; Ayo, 2002). Thus, the
Siamese settlements that formed a city had engaged in sev-
eral clashes over decades, and these have resulted in internal
displacement, loss of lives and property, occupational disem-
powerment, and economic regression among others
(Oyerinde, 2005). Between 1996 and 2003, the conflict took
a critical dimension when the federal government decided to
locate a new local government secretariat in Ife territory
where there had been a previous one, shared by the two
groups of settlers. The Modakekes felt that one out of the two
local government secretariats must be located in their terri-
tory while the Ifes opined that their counterpart late settlers
had no right to challenge the host. This generated crisis that
destroyed property, grounded public infrastructure, displaced
and claimed lives of residents, and negatively impacted their
economy and education. According to Albert (2001), most
Modakekes were peasant farmers while few of them were
into plantation farming. On the average, a plantation farmer
among them lost 2.75188 million Nigeria Naira (equivalent
of US$18, 345.87) worth of farm crops while the Ifes lost
nearly all the industrial establishments in their territory to the
conflict (Abegunde, 2010). According to Oyerinde (2005),
conflicts between the two settlements claimed 10,000 lives
and paralyzed the economy for years.
Preliminary Survey
Prior to the collection of the data needed for this study, the
researcher conducted a reconnaissance survey to the depart-
ment of community development and CBOs' leaders in the
two local government councils in the study area. This was to
know the total number of registered CBOs in each area.
Information obtained on the total number of the registered
CBOs also guided in the choice of the sample to be drawn
from the population for this study. It also assisted in locating
and identifying the respondents, seeking their consents and
explaining the study intention to them. Basic information
required before conducting the study therefore include the
contact addresses and mobile phone numbers of all the regis-
tered CBOs' heads in the study area. Relevant officers that
were approached on these in the government offices obliged
to these requests.
After locating the CBOs heads through phone contacts,
their consents were sought and they all consented. During
the reconnaissance survey, issues relating to the CBOs'oper-
ations as acquired in the literature were discussed with all the
CBOs' heads that were to become the respondents. They all
expressed their views, and relevant information that origi-
nated from the CBOs' heads during preliminary survey was
also incorporated into the list of data needed for the study.
Abegunde 5
Thus, the concerns for the study were well structured and
defined after the preliminary survey.
Results from the preliminary survey assisted the researcher
in the preparation of the questionnaire to be administered on
the CBOs' leaders. Ideally, the reconnaissance survey led to
the adoption of triangulation method for this study. While
ethical permission was granted by each of the respondents,
some of them requested for name anonymity on the pieces of
information to be supplied. This was strictly adhered to in
this study. The reconnaissance survey carried out also guided
the researcher to apply the basic concepts that were designed
and to establish the data needs for this study.
Relevant Terminologies
The term actual accomplishment index (AAI) in this study
refers to the degree of achievement of the projects conducted
by the CBOs in the study area as documented at the secondary
source (the CBOs'financial statement and other relevant mate-
rials) while the perceived accomplishment index (PAI) revealed
the opinions of residents, based on their observations of the
successes recorded by the CBOs'sociophysical activities.
For ease of primary data collection and analysis, the socio-
physical activities in this study were grouped into six catego-
ries. This was influenced by collective knowledge obtained
from the works of Mathew-Njoku, Angba, and Nwakwasi
(2009), Abegunde (2009), and Foster (2011) where the roles,
activities, and operations of the CBOs in some developing
countries were reviewed. The six groups are infrastructure
facilities, credit facilities, security of life and property, social
development, leadership training, and moral and spiritual
support. Bildt (2003) also observed that these activities are
very important in postconflict peace-building.
Infrastructure facilities as conceived in this study are the
essential amenities provided for the benefit of the public for
the social and economic development of the entire commu-
nity. Observations made about these infrastructure facilities
during reconnaissance survey revealed that they include pipe
borne water, bore hole, public toilet and urinary, neighbor-
hood hall, and roads among others. These facilities are nec-
essary and mostly available in any given community, but this
study focused on the specific ones provided by the CBOs in
the study area.
The term credit facilities as used in this study refer to eco-
nomic supports which were in form of credit loan and sub-
sidy, given to the people (especially the CBOs' members)
with or without their requests to cushion the effects of con-
flicts on residents'economy. The security of life and property
offered in the study area to CBOs' members was mostly in
form of informal local community police support to mem-
bers, based on requests. In other words, the CBOs either
formed the team that served as local vigilante group or they
employed those who would offer their services for economic
return. What this means is that such employees served as
security agents/guards to protect the CBOs'members in their
respective homes, especially at nights, although the security
of life and property that are offered to CBOs' members may
sometimes also include provision of money to them to pro-
cure relevant materials and hire guards to protect residents'
lives and properties. According to Bildt (2003), this need is
cardinal to sustainable postconflict peace-rebuilding.
Social development as it applies to this study includes
provision of subsidized or free health and educational mate-
rials to CBOs' members, training and granting of scholar-
ships to indigent people in the public, offering of public
enlightenment programs to sensitize residents on necessary
information on community development, peace talk and
movements among people, and rehabilitation of CBOs mem-
bers' affected houses and offices.
Information collected during reconnaissance survey on
the moral and spiritual support activities of the CBOs
include but not limited to raising free offering in form of
cash, food, and clothing to the needy and rendering of moral
assistance to CBOs'members during social functions such as
naming, marriage, burial, and graduation ceremonies among
others. It also include offering of counseling and sending of
encouraging words regularly to members during crises and
keeping widows and orphans in secured homes to avoid soli-
tude and depression. The reconnaissance survey also showed
that leadership training for key CBOs' leaders in this study
was by sending CBOs' leaders on train-the-trainers' pro-
grams on peace-building, entrepreneurship, financial or
community administration, and accountability.
Research Concerns
There were three basic issues of concern in this study. The
first was to examine the socioeconomic and physical charac-
teristics of the CBOs and to confirm the relationship that
existed among these variables in the study area. The study
also raised concern on how the sociophysical activities of the
CBOs were accomplished in actual term (according to the
documented information contained in the records of these
organizations) and perceptively, based on the physical obser-
vations and judgments of the community opinion leaders
who represented the end users of these projects in the study
area. Along this line, the third concern was to establish the
gap that could have existed between the qualitative and
quantitative assessments of the CBOs'accomplishment so as
to determine the degree of residents' satisfaction with the
CBOs' sociophysical activities. This was expected to assist
in understanding the level of CBOs intervention in postcon-
flict sociophysical performances and confirm the perception
of the residents to the claims of the CBOs on their socio-
physical services' provisions in the postconflict area.
Data Sources and Needs
Two sources of data were explored for this study. These are
primary and secondary sources. The latter was where financial

statement, records on social, economic, and physical activi-
ties, of the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria, was sourced from. The
primary source was where direct information concerning the
study was obtained through administration of structured ques-
tionnaire. Sourcing data from the two sources was informed
by some reasons. First, to avoid bias, Organisation for
Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD; 2008)
suggested sourcing information from more than a source on
studies that are conducted in intercommunal conflict area. It
should be recollected that this study was conducted on two
settlements that have fused together to become one. Besides
this, project delivery in many developing countries of the
world requires end users'opinions, irrespective of the reliabil-
ity of the documents available with the donors at the second-
ary source. According to Ohail and Cavill (2008), this will
reveal lapses between paper documents and physical reality
after project execution and such is necessary in countries
where leaders are corrupt, not accountable.
This study used triangulation method of data collection.
This method allows collection of data from two or more dif-
ferent sources for a research purpose. Yeasmin and Rahman
(2012) were of the opinion that this method could combine
both the advantages of qualitative (perceived) and quantita-
tive (actual) observations to arrive at meaningful conclu-
sions. This is just as recent developments in the philosophy
of science have contended that this method would provide
avenue for both perceived and actual data to interact to solve
research problems (Caracelli, 1997; Creswell, 2003; Hussein,
2009). According to Jacob (2001),
By combining multiple observers, theories, methods, and
empirical materials, researchers can hope to overcome the
weakness or intrinsic biases and the problems that come from
single-method, single-observer and single-theory studies. Often,
the purpose of triangulation in specific contexts is to obtain the
confirmation of findings through convergence of different
perspectives. The point at which the perspectives converge is
seen to represent the reality. (p. 3)
Information required of the CBOs for this study include
their years of establishment, number of members, capital
bases, average number of beneficiaries, likely sources of
generating funds, spatial extent of operations, and pulling
members within and out of the region of existence. These
spatial extents of operations were determined through calcu-
lation of the distances of different places of operations and
members'addresses to each of the CBOs'offices in the study
area.
The leaders or heads of these CBOs were also contacted
for secondary data, and relevant information were obtained
from their associations' archives on past number of projects
they set to accomplish and the degree of fulfilling these.
Others are the amount of money they anticipated for each
project and the total amount of money they realized and all
the internal and external sources of funds where they raised
the money to finance these projects. These CBOs' leaders
were targeted for both primary and secondary data because
they represented the interest of their members, lived among
the residents, and were exposed to public comments on resi-
dents' satisfactions about their organizations' sociophysical
activities in the study area. Studies have also shown that they
can also be recognized as opinion leaders on studies that are
community based (Gaventa, 2004; Khurram & Graham,
2008; Onyeozu, 2010). Thus, CBOs' leaders in the current
study were considered as community or opinion leaders dur-
ing data collection.
Data Collection Technique
Data from the primary source were collected through design
and administration of a structured questionnaire to all regis-
tered CBOs in Ile Ife. Reconnaissance survey revealed that
there were 359 CBOs that registered with the local govern-
ment councils in the city (Ife Community Development
Units, 2006). Thus, Ife East and Ife Central local government
councils had 135 and 193 registered CBOs from their 10 and
11 political wards, respectively (see Tables 1 and 2).
Forty percent (120) of these CBOs were randomly selected
for questionnaire administration. The choice was influenced
by earlier studies conducted on CBOs in the study area
(Agbola, 1998). The lists containing the CBOs'names in order
of registration with the two local governments in the study
area formed the sample frame. Two out of the first five

organizations in each of the CBOs' lists from the two local
government councils were selected through balloting. The
chance of selecting any CBO in the study area depended on
the inclusion of its name in the CBOs'lists at the local govern-
ment registry because these lists served as the sample frame
for this study. Subsequent samples were systematically
selected (without replacement) in order of how the CBOs'
names were listed in the registers with each of the two local
government councils. Information from reconnaissance sur-
vey revealed that the two local government councils used the
same style to categorize these CBOs in their registries. As
reflected in Table 2, this same categorization was used in
grouping the CBOs in this study. This does not mean that the
categorization should be generalized with what obtained in the
literature; it is only peculiar to this study and the study area.
During data collection, the CBOs' heads were asked to
rate each of the six sociophysical activities in the question-
naire that was administered on each of them, using Likert-
type scale of five points rating. These included highly
accomplished (meaning the projects were completed and in
use), accomplished (meaning the projects were not fully
completed but were useful to the residents, thereafter), mod-
erately accomplished (meaning that although the projects
were not completed but residents have high level of hope that
such works would not be abandoned but they would be use-
ful in the nearest future because the level of delivery had
crossed halfway), not well accomplished (meaning that the
CBOs worked on the projects, although they were not cur-
rently useful in any form to the residents at the time of con-
ducting this study, probably the work have not reached
halfway), and poorly accomplished (indicating that the proj-
ects had public awareness but they did not go beyond incep-
tion stage, if at all they were commenced physically). In the
same vein, information collected through secondary data on
the level of sociophysical projects implemented were also
categorized into five, namely, successfully completed (and in
use), completed well above halfway (to the level at which
residents did use it although it was not yet offering a full
satisfaction), completed about halfway (at least halfway
accomplished but it might not be useful to the residents in its
current state), completed below halfway (and no resources
forth coming to continue the work), and the project was
desired and was just initiated/not embarked upon (the work
was still at the inception stage). Worthy to note here is that
the ratings for data from both primary and secondary sources
were patterned alike. This is a requirement for an ex post
facto research design and will aid the analysis of data that are
collected through nonexperimental technique, especially
when qualitative and quantitative data are merged together
(Hussein, 2009).
Analytical Techniques Adopted
In the analysis, the ratings were assigned weight values of
5,4,3,2, and 1. These represent from highest degree of
accomplishment or completion to the least, respectively.
Analysis of data collected through questionnaire was tagged
perceived accomplishment index while the degree of project
completion from secondary source was referred to as actual
accomplishment index.
The PAI or AAI for each of the six variables was obtained
by finding the summation and dividing it by weight value
(SWV) of the total number of CBOs' heads that were inter-
viewed (N) in the study. It should be noted that SWV was the
addition of the product of the number of responses to each of
the variables and the weight value attached to each rating
(Afon, 2006). The mean ( for PAI and  for AAI) of either
PAI or AAI was calculated and the deviation about the mean
of each variable (Y -  for PAI and y -  for AAI) was
obtained by subtracting the mean index from the index of
each. The variance and standard deviation of each AI were
computed to reveal the scatter about the mean (Berenson &
Levine, 1996).
Having used triangulation method of data collection, the
study combined the results of PAI and AAI together through
the use of ex post facto research technique to draw conclu-
sions. According to Cohen, Manion, and Morrison (2007, pp.
264b-266), the mixed method allows for merging of preex-
isting and postfact data that can be matched in situations
where it is unethical to control or manipulate the dependent
variables. In this study, AAI obtained from secondary source
became the preexisting one while PAI which was obtained
latter through administration of questionnaire to confirm the
validity of the former (information from the secondary
source) served as the postfact data. On studies that require
only two sets of data as the case was in this study, Kerlinger
(1986) recommended the use of co-relational ex post facto
research design which involves the collection of two sets of
data by first identifying the antecedents of a current situation
retrospectively, with a view to determining the relationship
that could exist between this and the postdata, after merging
them together.
In addition, this study also used correlation coefficient to
test the relationship existing between socioeconomic charac-
teristics of CBOs and the physical development impact they
exerted on the residents in Ile Ife, Nigeria. This parametric
analysis depended on data collected from the secondary
source alone and used those variables that were numeric
among them. Such analysis is universally recognized, unlike
Likert-type scales that were computed using the interval
measurement that requires justification.
The Use of Likert-Type Scale Ordinal as an
Interval Measurement in This Study
The variables that were generated through Likert-type scale
in this study were treated as (possessing) interval measure-
ments. Such analytical technique requires detail explanations
to avoid statistical confusion. Prior to this study, Likert-type
scales, which unarguably are ordinal data and whose
8 SAGE Open
intervals cannot be considered as numeric have generated
arguments in the literature as to be solely treated as nonpara-
metric (Agresti, 2002) or to be absorbed in the parametric
techniques (Razzaque, 2013; Zaimah et al., 2013). Scholars
like Knapp (1990), Jamieson (2004); Chimi and Russell
(2009); Henson, Hull, and Williams (2010); and Amah
(2013) have opined that Likert-type scales are ordinals, lack-
ing numerical intervals. Thus, Clogg and Shihadeh (1994)
and Agresti (2002) contended that only nonparametric statis-
tical analyses should be used to process data with ordinal
scales and Kuzon, Urbanchek, and McCabe (1996) believed
that deviation from this will lead to committing one of the
terrible "sins" of statistical analysis. The works of Wilson,
Wainwright, Stehly, Stoltzfus, and Hoff (2013) and Kornfeld
(2013) were recent compliance to this school of thought.
These scholars' position is understood because Dolnicar and
Grun (2007) noted that the user-friendliness and malleability
of scale formats are not yet popular and are not well
researched into. Such low level of popularity could limit
Likert-type scales' universal comprehension, acceptability,
and benefit utilization.
In agreement with Dolnicar and Grun (2007), Davison
and Sharma (1988) had earlier observed that parametric tech-
nique could be applied to analyze variables that have been
collected from the field with interval characteristics. This
argument was upheld by three pillars. First, there has not
been a universal agreement among statisticians against the
introduction of assumed interval measurements in Likert-
type scale, just as "there have not been globally accepted
measuring scale that can be used to translate intangibles into
numbers" (Yusoff & Janor, 2014). These gaps have allowed
researchers to use discretions that are psychologically rea-
sonable and scientifically permissible to assign numbers to
rated scales in their researches, depending on the peculiari-
ties of their studies. Thus, many researchers have explored
this to promote scholarship across the globe (Afon, 2007;
Marateb, Mansourian, Adibi, & Farina, 2014; Sarafidou,
2013; Sullivan & Artino, 2013; Yusoff & Janor, 2014). For
instance, as far back as about two decades ago, more than
70% of the articles that contained ordinal data and published
within 5 years (1993-1997) in the Journal of Educational
Psychology and that of American Educational Research
Journal, Sociology of Education were analyzed using para-
metric technique (Harwell & Gatti, 2001).
The second reason is that Likert-type scale has been clas-
sified to be in the family of multicriteria model (Afon, 2006;
Carrasco, Villar, Hornos, & Herrera-Viedma, 2011). There is
therefore the need to establish the mean of its variables for
easy comparison (Afon, 2007). Along this line, scholars like
Jain (2013), Razzaque (2013), Zaimah et al. (2013), and
Yusoff and Janor (2014) had used 5- or 7-point Likert-type
scale in their works to treat ordinal data as intervals and they
had tested them through parametric analytical techniques
such as mean, ANOVA, t test, factor analysis, and multiple
regression.
The third reason is the current global influence of technol-
ogy and inclination of policy makers to facts and figures to
solve world's problems through objective judgment, even on
social and cultural issues that require qualitative analysis.
The phenomenon of turning ordinals to intervals serves as a
compromising ground for researchers to meet the world's
needs on this and to make intangibles to become tangibles
without losing the real values of research.
Scholars who completely oppose this development should
note that not even all numerical scales are of absolute values.
For instance, 50 °F is never considered as half of 100 °F in
true experience. Thus, Geramian, Mashayekhi, and Ninggal
(2012) and J. S. Gordon, Mahabee-Gittens, Andrews,
Christiansen, and Byron (2013) advocated for a compromise
on ordinal conversion to numerical and suggested that the
introduction of quantitative scales that have limited numbers,
rated in categorical form, with vague zero point and vague
unit value would be of help (Yusoff & Janor, 2014). This
made Likert-type scale of ordinal ratings of 1 to 5 values as
used in this current study to be accepted as tangible enough
to adopt respondents' judgments on sociophysical projects
that were carried out by CBOs in postconflict area of Ile Ife,
Nigeria.
Ratings developed for assessing the sociophysical proj-
ects carried out by the CBOs in this study were patterned
after the semantic differentials of Heise (1969) and Boone
and Boone (2012) which argued that the higher the positive
score implies the better the adjective that describes the issue
or object concerned, the higher values attached, the greater
the number and the wider the interval, though arranged in
ordinal manner and the better to treat such data as numeric
variables (Munshi, 1990). As Jamieson (2004) opined that
the judgment of the researcher and normal distribution of the
sample should be respected in applying parametric test to
ordinal scales. Hence, an attempt at calculating the mean,
standard deviation, and variance in this kind of a study is
accommodated in the literature (Bartkowiak & Sen, 2007).
Findings
The results obtained in this study were categorized into three
sections, based on the research concerns for the study. The
first section examined the socioeconomic characteristics of
the respondents and the CBOs they headed, while the second
rated the opinions of the CBOs' heads on the objectives they
set and the projects they executed after the conflicts in the
study area. The section also considered the postconflict suc-
cesses that were achieved by these CBOs on the sociophysi-
cal projects that they executed based on the funds they
generated from different sources over the space of 10 years.
The accomplishments of their set objectives were rated using
information that were gathered on the actual number of proj-
ects executed with the funds. The last section established the
relationship between perceived and actual fulfillment of the
CBOs sociophysical objectives in Ile Ife, Nigeria.

The Socioeconomic and Physical Characteristics
of CBOs in the Study Area
The socioeconomic characteristics of the CBOs and their leaders
in Ile Ife, Nigeria.The findings revealed that nearly all the
CBOs' leaders were literate, with close to two thirds (62.6%)
and about one third (30.5%) of them having tertiary and sec-
ondary education, respectively. A handful (7.0%) of them
had been to primary school. This could be why civil servants
(54.2%) who were expected to be literate were dominant
among them, whereas traders (10.8%), farmers (2.5%), and
retirees (4.2%) were sparsely represented. Some CBOs'
leaders' occupations (28%) were not categorically indicated
during interview.
Table 3 shows that the gender gap among the CBOs'lead-
ers was very marginal. Thus, male respondents among them
were 50.8% while their female counterparts were 49.2%.
Mode of fund generation by the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria. Fund is
necessary for the proper fulfillment of CBOs objectives. Table
4 reflects that personal contribution (64.2%) by members was
the major source of fund generation in CBOs in Ile Ife. In other
words, the members of the associations were expected to con-
tribute certain amount of money as part of their commitments
to their associations and to run the activities of the CBOs.
Other sources of fund include donations through charity
(12.5%), loans (4.2%), grants from government (3.3%), and
money generated through investment of the associations
(15.8%). It can be deduced here that funding in CBOs in Ile Ife
was through joint contribution and money that they realized
from their investment and not by government support. This
study is in agreement with Eziyi (2009) that asserted that fund-
ing of CBOs in Nigeria is mainly an association's members'
affair. It, however, contradicted the findings of Krivelyova
et al. (2013) which was conducted across three developing
nations in Africa where their governments and other donors
contributed reasonably to local development programs at
grassroots level. It should be noted that funding from such
multiple sources in Krivelyova et al.'s (2013) work were not
remitted to or coordinated by the CBOs of these countries as
the case was in Eziyi (2009) and in the current study.
Years of establishment of the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria. The years
of establishing the CBOs covered by this study were grouped
into seven. These include those established in the period of
less than 5 years ago, between 5 and 10 years, 11 and 15
years, and 16 and 20 years to the time of conducting this
study. Others include those established between 21 years and
25 years, 26 years and 30 years, and above 30 years to the
time of conducting the survey for this study.
The choice of these categories was influenced by different
past political era in the country. Table 5 reflects that a hand-
ful (13.3%) of these CBOs came into existence in less than 5
years ago while a very negligible percentage of them was
established between 2004 and 2008 (2.5%), and above 30
years (1.9%) to the time of this study, respectively. Implicit
to this is that most (75.8%) of the CBOs came into existence
between 1989 and 2003; a period of about one and half
decades.
The CBOs proliferation reduced after this era as the table
reveals that only 15.6% of them were established between
2004 and 2013; a decade period. Worthy to note is that the
communal conflicts that affected the city ended in 2003.
Residents were expected to have been displaced and new
CBOs might not be easy to form until social order was fully
restored. On the contrary, the few CBOs that were formed
after, together with those existing before the conflicts must
have aimed at improving the living conditions of the resi-
dents by fulfilling their local targets to prove their relevance
in the conflict affected economy. In reference to this, the
unstandardized coefficient of the sociophysical performance
of the CBOs in Table 5 determines the strength of its

relationship with the number of years of their existence
(years of establishment). Thus, the coefficient for the years
of establishing the CBOs (.627) in the table predicted an
increase in their sociophysical performance. Since the rela-
tionship was significant (p = .000), it shows that there was a
linear relationship between the tested variables. It can be
inferred that the longer the years of establishment, the higher
the level of sociophysical performance of CBOs in the post-
conflict community.
Membership of the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria. Table 6 reflects the
factors that influenced membership absorptions into the
CBOs within the study area. As seen in the table, two fifths
of the associations indicated that their membership was loca-
tion (43.3%) and professionally (38.5%) based. In other
words CBOs in the former group were formed by and limited
to residents that were living together in specific neighbor-
hoods or areas in Ile Ife. Thus, the membership of those
CBOs was not opened to other residents that hailed from out-
side the immediate environment defined by the associations.
This is expected in a postconflict area because loss of
confidence, identity, and trust in distant residents can confine
people to join CBOs in their immediate vicinity where
comembers are known and the people are sure of security of
life, confidentiality of information, and safety in interrela-
tionship (Haider, 2009). In addition, Ife and Modakeke as
Siamese settlements in a city called Ile Ife host residents who
have distinct identities but are with discrete opinions due to
past intercommunal conflicts that took place among them.
Residents in such kind of environment would have choices
of CBOs they would want to belong. This could be why
43.3% of the CBOs indicated that their members were from
their immediate environment. Thus, about 30% of the CBOs
in Table 2 who registered with the government as landlord
associations must have had their membership from different
neighborhoods where members who built their houses were
living. Under this condition, membership becomes compul-
sory rather than voluntary (Chechetto-Salles & Geyer, 2006).
Along this line, nativity (13.4%) of residents was a factor in
absorbing membership to some CBOs in the study area. This
indicates that resident's origin (by street or quarters) was
location specific and has its spatial dimension and this influ-
enced over one tenth of the CBOs' membership in the study
area. The CBOs'members who were influenced by their reli-
gions (4.8%) to join CBOs in the study area were very few
and their membership may not be spatially inclined. Such
low representation is insignificant but it reveals that resi-
dents' beliefs can sometimes influence the choice of com-
munity development associations that they choose to join in
Africa (Dimelu et al., 2013).
Correlation of the effects of the socioeconomic characteristics of
CBOs on spatial attributes of Ile Ife, Nigeria. The result of the
relationship between socioeconomic and spatial characteris-
tics of the studied CBOs was conducted using Pearson's cor-
relation at p  .01 significant level. As revealed in Table 7,

there was a positive and direct relationship between income
and six out of the seven tested variables. Of high significance
among them are the relationships that their income had with
the capital base of the CBOs (0.647), their years of establish-
ment (0.523), the number of membership (0.711), and the
number of members who have directly benefited from the
socioeconomic and physical operations of CBOs in the study
area (0.373). What this implies is that as the number of years
of establishment increased, the capital base of these CBOs
(through contributions from members and other sources of
fund generation) could have positively influenced their
investments and the attendant income. Because the joint con-
tribution was the main source of fund generation in these
CBOs (see Table 3), those of them with large membership
would have had the opportunity of generating more funds to
invest, resulting in high income. Thus, the number of people
who claimed to have benefited in the CBOs' projects was
said to have been significantly influenced by their capital
bases (0.430, p < .01), number of members (0.454, p < .01),
and monthly income (0.373, p < .01). All these must have
contributed to the spatial extent of the CBOs' operations
(0.475) in the study area. Considering the first concern for
this study, this is an assurance that relationships existed
between certain socioeconomic and physical characteristics
of the CBOs in the study area.
Measurement of the Sociophysical Activities and
Projects Carried Out by the CBOs in the Study
Area
PAI of the sociophysical objectives fulfilled by the CBOs in Ile Ife,
Nigeria.The success rate of the social and physical objec-
tives that were set by the CBOs in Ile Ife was measured as
CBOs' PAI. According to Table 8, major services provided
to members and communities were grouped into six. These
are infrastructure facilities, credit facilities, security of life
and property, social support, leadership training, and moral
and spiritual assistance. These are considered as the objec-
tives of CBOs in this study.
As reflected in the table, a little close to two thirds of the
respondents indicated that the desire of their CBOs to pro-
vide credit facilities (56.6%) and social development (65.0%)
was accomplished. This could be why their PAIs were well
above the computed mean PAI (3.07). These are credit facili-
ties (3.20) and social development (3.47). Although, the
table revealed that on the average, the CBOs claimed to have
provided security of life and property; and moral and spiri-
tual supports to members and other residents in the study
area. As shown in the table, these set objectives were not
well accomplished in the study area because their AIs ranged
between 3.01 and 2.66; which are below the mean PAI (3.07).
Hence, the deviation about the mean of infrastructure facili-
ties (-1.02), security of life and property (-0.06), leadership
training (-0.41), and moral and spiritual supports (-0.13)
were negative.
Actual postconflict sociophysical tasks and projects that were set
to be and were accomplished through funds that were generated
by the CBOs in Ile Ife,Nigeria. The secondary data collected on
the sociophysical activities of the CBOs in Ile Ife revealed
that they aimed at providing 779 credit facilities and 1,134
moral and spiritual supports to members and trained 224 key
leaders of their associations after the conflicts in the study
area. During this period, they also outlined 117 community
development projects on infrastructural facilities, 129 social
developmental programs, and 24 projects toward security of
lives and property. These made 2,338 (2,068 for members
and 270 projects for the community) decade plans of the
organizations. Table 9 reflects that a total amount of 633.24
million Nigerian Naira (about US$4.2 million) would have
completed the projects and tasks, all things being equal. The
table shows that a little above two thirds of the amount
needed to provide credit facilities to their members (68.5%)
and more than half of what were projected for infrastructural
facilities (55.7%) and security of lives and property (54.4%)
were realized. These funds were mostly generated internally
by members. Overall, these projects and tasks were poorly
supported by the community (6.64%), except those that were
under infrastructure provision. They were also least assisted
by the government (5.49%). The bulk (25.19%) of the total
contributions realized (50.93%) from sources of fund gener-
ation came from the CBOs' members while only 16.35% of
this were generated from external sources. The CBOs' mem-
bers' inability to contribute beyond one quarter of the set
fund evidently affected the completion rate of the projects or
tasks. At the end of a decade, Table 9 shows that 38.5%,
31.9%, and 29.6% of the entire objectives were successfully
accomplished, commenced but not completed, and not initi-
ated at all, respectively.
Of these, security of lives and property (55.9%), credit
facilities to members (54.8%), and infrastructural facilities to
the community (49.6%) were projects or tasks with remark-
able successes while only about one sixth of the social devel-
opment programs and leadership training to key members
were fully completed. Hence, about two fifths of the outlined
projects or tasks that were set on social development pro-
grams (45.8%), moral and spiritual supports to members
(41.4%), and leadership training (39.3%) were not initiated
at all. This is because less than one third of the funds bud-
geted to accomplish the first mentioned two items were real-
ized. Worthy to note in the table is that despite the realization
of about half (46%) of the money that was expected to train
the CBOs key leaders, 45.5% and 39.3% of the training were
not commenced and not completed at all in the study area,
respectively. On the average, about one third of all the tasks
or projects were carried out but not completed within the 10
years after the conflicts in the study area.

denoted as AAI, and this is in agreement with the informa-
tion contained in the secondary data that were collected from
the CBOs in the study area (see Table 9). The fulfillments of
the sociophysical objectives in the Table 10 were from 1 to 5
point ratings, in order of the level of their accomplishments.
Projects or objectives that were successfully or nearly com-
pleted by the CBOs and were delivered for usage had the
highest score and were rated 5 (91%-100%). In the contrary,
projects that were set to be accomplished in the CBOs'objec-
tives but were not initiated or did not go beyond inception
stage had the least score of one point rating (10%). Projects
that were (at least) accomplished about halfway but did not
(at most) go beyond two thirds of the stage toward comple-
tion had a moderate score of three (45%-67%). Those that
were accomplished beyond their inception stages but were
not really executed beyond halfway were rated as having two
points (11%-44%) while those that were accomplished above
two-thirds stage level but were not really completed were
rated as having four points (68%-90%) in the study. Hence,
the number of the projects that were successfully completed
in each of these variables was not less than the summation of
the number of projects that were not completed in each
category.
As reflected in the table, the highest AAI was 4.07
(provision of security of life and property to members)
while the least was 2.35 (provision of leadership training
to key leaders). The average AAI (mean AAI) was 3.21.
This means that variables on the provision of credit facil-
ities' to members (AAI = 3.90) and infrastructural facili-
ties for public consumption (AAI = 3.70) were well above
the mean AAI (3.21) in the study area. This was why the
deviations about the mean of their AAIs (denoted as y -
) were all positive (infrastructure facilities = 0.49; credit
facilities to members = 0.69 and security of life and prop-
erty = 0.86). In the contrary, the deviations about the
mean of the AAIs of other variables like social develop-
ment (-0.71), leadership training to key leaders (-0.86),
and moral and spiritual supports to members (-0.50)
were all negative because their indexes were below the
computed mean. Expectedly, the summation of the total
number of the projects that were not embarked upon and
that were not completed at all in each of these latter three
variables was above the total number of projects that
were successfully completed under each of them as
reflected in Table 9.
The Balance Between PAI and AAI of
Sociophysical Projects Embarked Upon by the
CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria
All the variables that were tested in the course of analyzing
the PAI and the AAI on the sociophysical activities of the
CBOs in Ile Ife were grouped into four. This was based on
the results of their computed indexes, deviation about the
means and their variances. This was to provide a platform to
draw meaningful conclusions on the two analyses. Table 11
presents the groupings.
Group A.The table reflects that only the variable on provi-
sion of credit facilities to members of the CBOs had the com-
puted indexes for PAI (3.20) and AAI (2.27) to be both above
their calculated mean indexes (PAI = 3.07, AAI = 2.08), with
positive deviations (PAI = 0.13, AAI = 0.29) about their
means. This means that its PAI and AAI indexes both agreed
that CBOs in the study area have successfully delivered their
sociophysical services to the residents in the postconflict
community.
Group B. Findings showed that variables on social programs
carried out by the CBOs in the community and that of secu-
rity of life and property rendered to residents were in this
category. The former had its PAI (3.47) above the mean
index (3.07) while its AAI had negative deviation (-0.37)
about the mean because its index (1.71) was below the calcu-
lated mean (2.08). Hence, the assurance that this variable had
positively impacted the sociophysical development in the
study area was influenced by the perception of the people
(PAI = 3.47) rather than by the information that was gener-
ated from the actual amount of money that was spent (see
Table 9) on all the projects (see Table 10) that were success-
fully completed. This was why the summation of the devia-
tions about the mean of PAI and AAI of the social programs
that were carried out by the CBOs was low, though it was
positive [{(Y - ) + (y - ) / 2} = 0.02].
As reflected in Table 11, the average of the summation
{[(Y - ) + (y - ) / 2] = 0.36} of deviations about the mean
of PAI (-0.06) and AAI (0.032) of the variable on security of
life and property that was provided by the CBOs was posi-
tive. This was so because the computed index for AAI (2.50)
was well above its mean index (2.08) with a positive devia-
tion about the mean (0.42). The findings revealed that the
results obtained in AAI had a dominant effect on the negative
deviation about the mean (-0.06) of PAI whose index (3.01)
was a little below the computed mean (3.07). What this
implies is that the variable on provision of security of life and
property in the study area did not only record a success of
being accomplished under the AAI (2.50) with positive devi-
ation about the mean (0.42) but on the average, the result of
the summation of the deviations about the mean of both PAI
and AAI agreed to this {[(Y - ) + (y - ) / 2] = 0.36} being
positive.
Group C. The variable on provision of infrastructural facili-
ties by the CBOs was in a separate class in this study because
the average of the summation of the deviations about the
mean of both PAI and AAI was negative {[(Y - ) + (y - )
/ 2] =  -1.02}, though the computed index for AAI (2.27)
was well above its mean index (2.08) with positive deviation
about the mean (0.19). Thus, the result of AAI (= 2.27) was
not strong enough to suppress the perception of the people

(PAI = 2.68) (whose deviation about the mean was negative
[-1.02]) that the activities of the CBOs on the provision of
infrastructure facilities were not beneficiary to the residents.
This could be why the variable was rated as not accom-
plished by the residents in the study area.
Group D.Two variables were in this category. These are
leadership training to key leaders (PAI = 2.66, AAI = 1.76)
among the CBOs and moral and spiritual support to members
(PAI = 2.94, AAI = 1.88) in the study area. Both of these
variables had their accomplishment indexes to be below their
computed mean indexes (PAI = 3.07, AAI = 2.08) and nega-
tive deviations about the mean. Expectedly, their (Y - ) +
(y - ) / 2 were -0.36 and -0.17, respectively. The negative
results indicate that the two variables were both counted as
not accomplished, either in the actual term of money
expended by the number of projects executed (AAI) or by
the people's perception on what they witnessed and benefited
on these (PAI) in this study.
Discussions
The current study established CBOs' thresholds in postcon-
flict area of Africa and provided a basis for determining their
success rate on their sociophysical project delivery. The use
of mixed method through ex post facto technique to collect
and analyze quantitative (actual [AAI]) and qualitative (per-
ceived [PAI]) data on the CBOs activities contributed to rel-
evant past studies on peace-building in fragile communities
(Creswell, 2003; Leone & Ward, 2013). This agreed with the
works of Reinikka and Collier (2001), Collier and Hoeffler
(2002), Collier (2003), Short (2003), Narman and
Vidanapathirana (2005), and Luckham (2017).
Results of the survey first examined the socioeconomic
characteristics of these CBOs and noted that most (75.8%) of
them came into existence in about one and half a decade era,
a period between 1989 and 2003. The CBOs'number reduced
between 2004 and 2013, a decade period. The former period
was marked with intercommunal violent conflicts in many
local communities across the nation (Internally Displaced
Project, 2006; Oyerinde, 2005) which cause national eco-
nomic regression (Behnassi, Pollmann, & Kissinger, 2013)
as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country at that
time was less than 18.2% growth annually (Ekpo & Umoh,
2012). This could be why Dongier et al. (2001) and Annan
(2014) opined that economic regression and state failure in
low-income countries breed violent conflicts (Collier &
Hoeffler, 2002) but promote CBOs' formation (Poskitt &
Dufranc, 2011) to meet community needs (Barron, Diprose,
Madden, Smith, & Woolcock, 2004; Ogundipe, 2003). This
reveals the willingness of residents to internally raise fund
for their communal well-being, even amid poverty. Along
this line, most of the projects that were executed in the cur-
rent study were financed through the money that was con-
tributed mainly by the CBOs' members (64.2%). This has a
root in the self-determination theory of Nicholls (1984) and
Deci and Ryan (2008) and the community need model of
Burton (1990). Thus, resiliency to the failure of the central
government (Larsson et al., 2012) and active participation of
individuals and corporate groups at grassroots (Barr et al.,
2010) are necessities in postconflict peace-building
(Onyedinma & Kanayo, 2013; United Nations Department
of Economic and Social Affairs, 2009). The period between
2004 and 2013 when the number of CBOs in this study was
low was an era when the conflicts reduced and the GDP of
Nigeria was increasing at an annual growth rate of about 6%
(Barung, 2014). Although such experience may not equally
translate to real economic development (Sanusi, 2010), it can
be inferred that high number of CBOs that were created dur-
ing economic recession must have contributed to the coun-
try's economic growth that was recorded after conflicts. This
positioned the current study within the bottom-up school of
thought as CBOs at local level can be pro-poor tools for
peace-building in postconflict communities. The study also
served as an eye opener to the need for a research on the
indirect relationship that could exist between CBOs' prolif-
eration and national economic development in the develop-
ing nations.
The current study showed that only 5.49% of the money
raised by the CBOs came from the government while it was
expected of her to contribute to CBOs purses to alleviate the
sufferings of the conflict affected residents (Cernea, 1984;
Keech, Munger, & Simon, 2012; Leeson, 2007). Results also
showed that only a handful of the amount (16.35%) of the
money raised by the CBOs came through some external
sources. Although this contribution was low, it indicated that
NGOs and donors assisted CBOs in fragile communities of
Africa (Omofonmwan & Odia, 2009). The CBOs were not
able to raise much money through loans, possibly because
they must have lost their fixed assets that could serve as col-
lateral securities during conflicts. Socioeconomically, one
would expect that the membership of such associations that
depended on members' contributions to thrive should have a
wider geographical coverage. However, findings showed
that a sizable proportion (43.3%) of them was drawn from
the immediate neighborhoods. This agreed with the works of
Flórez (2002) and Lindley (2007) in Colombia and Somalia,
respectively. Another issue of consideration in this current
study is that its sample cut across different types of CBOs. In
agreement with Haider (2009) and Skinner (2005), CBOs are
formed by people of common interests who created different
informal trades and unions to combat poverty. This could be
why more than half of the CBOs were headed by well literate
civil servants who though were employed under the govern-
ment, they still engaged in CBOs that drew members from
different informal sectors (La Porta & Shleifer, 2014;
Peschka, 2011). Although, studies have shown that faith-
based institutions are parts of the CBOs that do contribute to
community development and peace-building across the
world (Foster, 2011; La Porta & Shleifer, 2014; Nolte, 2009;
Abegunde 19
The Urban Institute & Vidal, 2001), they seemed not to be
represented in this study. The reason could be that they were
not registered with the government because the sample in
this study was drawn mainly from the list of the CBOs that
registered with the local government councils in the study
area. This study could not categorically account for this lapse
but the works of Roberts, Odumosu, and Nabofa (2009) and
Odumosu, Olaniyi, and Alonge (2009) threw light on this.
They both claimed that Nigerian local governments do not
register religious institutions as CBOs but they are responsi-
ble to their headquarters that registered with the government
at federal level. Of interest in this study is the equality of the
CBOs' leaders' males and females' proportion. This differed
from many past African studies where males dominated the
sample size due to the cultural setting of the region (Chant &
Gutman, 2000; Jensen, 2012). The current study upheld the
notions that conflicts pave way for women (Jensen, 2012;
Kvitashvili, 2007; Mackenzie, 2012).
The current study also examined the six CBOs' objec-
tives that were set to achieve their sociophysical activities
and showed that all the tested six variables scored above
half (PAI + AAI  2.51) of the 5-point scale in their ratings.
Although this study pioneered the categorization of CBOs'
objectives into six groups in postconflict area of Nigeria, it
gave credit to the works of Mathew-Njoku et al. (2009) and
Foster (2011). Two of these objectives had the highest rep-
resentatives among others. These are security of life and
property to residents and credit facilities to members. This
agreed with the works of Lindley (2007), Jensen (2012) and
Badiora and Abegunde (2015) that showed that security of
lives and property and financial support to residents who
have lost property and breadwinners to conflicts are very
crucial challenges in fragile communities (OECD, 2008). In
addition, postconflict areas are always characterized by
crime of all sorts, calling for security of lives and property
(Shemyakina, 2006). Although the AAI of security of life
and property was high in this study, its PAI was below its
mean index with negative deviation about the mean. This
means that the residents possibly desired higher level of
security of lives and property than what the CBOs could
provide. Similar condition trailed the AAI and PAI results of
variable on the infrastructural facilities provided by the
CBOs in the study area. This could be why Bowd and
Chikwanha (2010) opined that security and infrastructural
challenges in postconflict environment cannot be easily met
by an average fund (Africa Region Disaster Risk
Management Team, 2010; Reinikka & Collier, 2001). This
calls for a rethink and pressure from international organiza-
tions on African governments to support CBOs and relief
residents in postconflict communities. A body called
National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) which
was created by the federal government of Nigeria (Federal
Republic of Nigeria, 1999) and located at the country's capi-
tal city can be replicated at local level to provide support to
those CBOs in conflict-affected communities.
The study further showed that a little less than one third of
what the CBOs budgeted to spend on social development
was realized and the residents claimed to be satisfied with
this. This may appear spurious but Fischer (2006) had earlier
noted that residents' social needs after conflict may not be
economically highly demanding like their need for infra-
structural facilities (McCandless & Karbo, 2011). Findings
further revealed that variables whose PAI and AAI were both
below mean index values, with negative deviations about the
mean in this study, are leadership training to key leaders and
moral and spiritual supports to CBOs' members. As earlier
reflected in Table 9, the study showed that very little money
was realized and utilized under the former variable. S.
Johnson (2001) claimed that the latter could be so because
the standard of communal living among residents in Africa is
very high (Onyedinma & Kanayo, 2013) and the CBOs
efforts might have fallen below the people's expectations.
There are many recent works that have used AI to analyze
empirical data that were collected on researches (Afon, 2006;
Belaire, Westphal, Whelan, & Minor, 2015; V. E. Johnson,
1997; Peyre, MacDonald, Al-Marayati, Templeman, &
Muderspach, 2010; Satterfield, Gregory, Roberts, Chan, &
Grayev, 2013; Ziemlewicz, Kim, Romandine, & Robbins,
2013). The present study seemed to be the first to pioneer the
combination of AAI and PAI to empirically examine the socio-
physical activities of CBOs in a postconflict area of Africa.
Results showed that this can be replicated elsewhere, especially
in otherAfrican low-income communities where protracted cri-
ses have resulted in cyclical poverty, calling for pro-poor inward
looking strategies (Gambari, 2002; Machel, 2004). A study of
