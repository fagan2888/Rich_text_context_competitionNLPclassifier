Abstract
Objectives: To study the effects of diet on disease progression and activity levels of adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and its downstream targets, in an amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) animal model.
Methods: AMPK activity was measured in cerebral cortex, spinal cord, cerebellum and hindlimb
muscle tissue using immunohistochemistry in transgenic mice overexpressing human superoxide
dismutase-1 (SOD1G93A) fed a high-fat (HFD), standard ad libitum (AL) or calorie-restricted (CR)
diet; AMPK activity was also measured in wild-type (SOD1WT) mice. Activity of AMPK and
phospho-AMPK, acetyl coenzyme-A carboxylase (ACC), phospho-ACC and heat shock protein-70
(Hsp70) were also measured using Western blot. Food intake and grip strength were recorded;
body composition was analysed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Motor neuron survival
was observed using Nissl staining.
Results: AMPK activity increased and Hsp70 expression decreased in AL SOD1G93A mice
compared with SOD1WT mice in spinal cord and hindlimb muscle. Compared with AL SOD1G93A
mice, CR SOD1G93A mice showed increased AMPK activity, downregulated Hsp70 expression,
reduced motor neuron survival in spinal cord and hindlimb muscle and reduced lifespan; HFD
SOD1G93A mice showed opposite effects.
Conclusions: In this mouse model, increased AMPK activity seems to play a negative role in
motor neuron survival, possibly through a novel mechanism involving Hsp70 downregulation.
These changes can be modified by diet. Inhibition of AMPK may provide a therapeutic strategy
for ALS.

Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a
neurodegenerative disease that selectively
involves the spinal anterior horn cells,
brainstem motor nuclei and pyramidal
tracts.1 A dominant mutation in the gene
that encodes for the enzyme superoxide
dismutase-1 (SOD1) accounts for 20% of
familial ALS cases,2 therefore it is possible
to model ALS using transgenic mice that
overexpress a human SOD1 transgene with
a pathogenic glycine to alanine substitution
(SOD1G93A).
Pathophysiological mechanisms underly-
ing the development of ALS remain unclear;
however, ALS patients often display a series
of metabolic abnormalities including hyper-
metabolism, abnormal glucose tolerance and
hyperlipidaemia.3­5 Similarly, SOD1G93A
mice also show hypermetabolism and post-
prandial low-fat hyperlipidaemia in the pre-
symptomatic stages of ALS.6 Therefore,
elucidating the mechanisms behind the
energy deficiencies that affect disease pro-
gression in SOD1 mutant mice could yield
new insights into the causes of human ALS.
Adenosine monophosphate-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellu-
lar stress that is involved in maintaining
energy homeostasis. AMPK is activated
during energy stress by various upstream
kinases via phosphorylation of threonine
172 within the catalytic a2 subunit.7
Downstream consequences of AMPK acti-
vation include increased glucose uptake and
fatty acid oxidation, and the inhibition of
cholesterol, lipid and protein synthesis.8
Since neurons are sensitive to energy fluc-
tuations as they execute energy-demanding
functions without efficiently storing nutrients,
AMPK is essential for neuronal integrity and
survival.9 AMPK activation protects primary
neuronal cultures from excitotoxicity and
other insults;10 however, some experimental
work has suggested that AMPK activation
could be detrimental in animal models of
stroke,11 Alzheimer's disease12,13 and
Huntington's disease.14 In the present study,
activity levels of AMPK and its downstream
targets acetyl coenzyme-A carboxylase and
heat shock protein-70 were compared in
SOD1G93A and wild-type SOD1 mice,
and the effects of calorie restrictive and
high-fat diets were assessed. In addition, the
effects of diet on disease progression were
studied.
Materials and methods
Animals
All animals were purchased from the
Model Animal Research Centre of
Nanjing University, Nanjing, China (ori-
ginally obtained from The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and
were reared in the experimental animal
department of Peking University Health
Science Centre, Beijing, China. The strains
B6SJL-TgN(SOD1G93A)1Gur and
B6SJL-TgN(SOD1)2Gur were used for
the mutant transgenic and wild-type
SOD1 transgenic mice, respectively. All
experiments were performed on male mice.
Three to five mice were housed per cage
under a 12-h light/dark cycle. All proced-
ures were approved by the Ethics
Committee for Experimental Animals,
Peking University Health Science Centre,
Beijing, China.

Diet
Up to postnatal day 39 (P39), all mice were
fed ad libitum a standard rodent diet con-
taining 4% fat and 5% protein. From P40,
the wild-type SOD1 (SOD1WT) mice (n ¼ 15)
continued to receive a standard rodent diet
ad libitum, but the SOD1G93A mice were fed
either an identical standard rodent diet (AL;
n ¼ 28), a calorie-restricted diet providing
60% of the average daily food intake of the
corresponding ad libitum group (CR;
n ¼ 26), or a high-fat diet containing 21%
fat and 0.15% cholesterol (HFD; n ¼ 30).
Assessment
Food intake measurements were initiated at
P43 and recorded until P120 in all the
SOD1G93A mice.
To determine disease onset, grip strength
was assessed twice a week in all the
SOD1G93A mice by measuring their ability
to hold on to the cage bar for 20 s while they
were upside down, as described previously.15
Survival was also recorded in the SOD1G93A
mice, with death being defined as the point
at which the mouse could no longer roll back
to a normal position within 10 s of being
placed on its back.
Body weight and composition
Body weight was logged twice a week from
P43 until P120 in all the SOD1G93A mice.
Body composition was analysed using dual
energy X-ray absorptiometry in isoflurane-
anaesthetized SOD1G93A mice at P120, as
described previously.16
Immunohistochemistry
Motor cortex, cerebellum and lumbar spinal
cord samples were obtained from SOD1WT
and AL, HFD and CR SOD1G93A mice at
P90 (n ¼ 5 for all groups) and P120 (n ¼ 5,
n ¼ 5, n ¼ 6 and n ¼ 5, respectively) for
immunohistochemical analysis of phospho-
AMPK (pAMPK) activity. Mice were
deeply anaesthetized with 7% chloral
hydrate in saline (350 mg/kg intraperitone-
ally) and perfused transcardially with 0.9%
NaCl. Brain and spinal cord were carefully
dissected and tissue samples were Exed in
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/l phos-
phate buffer (pH 7.4) for 24 h, then sub-
mersed in increasing concentrations of
sucrose overnight to provide cytoprotection.
All the tissue samples were then embedded
in paraffin wax and sectioned at 6 mm.
Immunohistochemical staining of the
motor cortex, cerebellum and lumbar
spinal cord sections was performed as
described previously.17 Anti-pAMPK
rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) diluted to
1 : 200 in blocking buffer (pH 7.4) was used
as the primary antibody; horseradish perox-
idase-labelled goat antirabbit antibody
(Zhongshan Biotechnology, Beijing,
China), diluted to 1 : 2000, was used as the
secondary antibody. Sections were stained
using diaminobenzine and haematoxylin.
Immunoreactivity was quantified by measur-
ing the mean staining densities (sum of
grey values of all pixels in the selected area
divided by the number of pixels within the
area) in five randomly selected areas from
each specimen, using Scion Image software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD, USA).
Nissl staining
The number of motor neurons in the anter-
ior horns of lumbar spinal cord tissue sam-
ples obtained as described above from AL
(n ¼ 5), CR (n ¼ 5) and HFD (n ¼ 6)
SOD1G93A mice was assessed at P120 by
Nissl staining using Cresyl Violet (Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), following a
standard method. Cells with diameters
> 25 mm, which were considered to be
Zhao et al. 69
motor neurons, were then counted in six
tissue sections from each mouse.18
Western blot analysis
Activity levels of AMPK and pAMPK, and
the downstream targets of AMPK acetyl
coenzyme-A carboxylase (ACC), ACC
phosphorylated at serine 79 (pACC) and
heat shock protein-70 (Hsp70) in SOD1WT
and AL, CR and HFD SOD1G93A mice were
assessed in spinal cord, cerebral cortex and
cerebellum tissue lysates at P90 and P120;
they were also assessed in hindlimb muscle
tissue at P120 using Western blot analysis
(n ¼ 5 for each group).
Mice were deeply anaesthetized with 7%
chloral hydrate in saline (350 mg/kg intra-
peritoneally) and decapitated. The relevant
tissues were removed, frozen in isopentane at
À70C and stored in a deep freezer at À80C
for 24­48 h. All tissue samples were homo-
genized on ice with lysis buffer (210 mM
mannitol, 70 mM sucrose and 10 mM
HEPES, pH 7.2), 1 mM ethylene glycol
tetra-acetic acid, freshly supplemented with
0.5% w/v fatty-acid free bovine serum albu-
min, and protease and phosphatase inhibi-
tors. Lysates were sonicated, separated from
particulate matter by centrifugation (10 min
at 12 000 g at 4C, then boiled in 1 Â sodium
dodecyl sulphate protein loading buffer (pH
6.8) containing 1% b-mercaptoethanol.
Western blot was performed as previ-
ously described19 using AMPKa, pAMPK,
ACC, pACC and Hsp70 antibodies (all from
Cell Signaling Technology). b-Actin anti-
body (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA)
was used as the loading control.
Statistical analyses
All experiments were repeated at least three
times. Results were expressed as the mean Æ
SEM of at least three independent experi-
ments unless stated otherwise. Between-
group differences were determined using a
two-tailed Student's t-test. For comparisons
of multiple groups, one-way analysis of
variance was performed. For disease onset
and survival analyses, the Kaplan­Meier
method with log-rank test was used. A two-
tailed P-value < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant. All statistical ana-
lyses were performed using SPSS software
version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Activity levels of AMPK and its downstream
targets in SOD1WT and SOD1G93A mice
Motor cortex, cerebellum and lumbar spinal
cord sections from SOD1WT and AL
SOD1G93A mice exhibited analogous levels
of pAMPK immunoreactivity at P90 (data
not shown). At P120, increased expression
of pAMPK was seen in the lumbar spinal
cord (Figure 1A and 1B) but not in the
cerebellum or the motor cortex (data not
shown) of AL SOD1G93A mice compared
with SOD1WT controls.
On Western blot analysis, there was a 64%
increase in the pAMPK/AMPK ratio, a 110%
increase in the pACC/ACC ratio and a 31%
decrease in Hsp70 expression in spinal cord
tissue lysates from AL SOD1G93A mice com-
pared with SOD1WT controls at P90 (Figure
2A and 2C). These changes are consistent with
an increase in AMPK activity in AL
SOD1G93A mice. Such differences were even
more apparent in spinal cord tissue at P120
(Figure 2B and 2D). Similar differences were
seen in hindlimb muscle samples from AL
SOD1G93A mice compared with SOD1WT con-
trols at P120 (Figure 3A and 3C), but not in
cerebellum or cerebral cortex tissue samples at
P90 or P120 (Figure 2A and 2B).
Effect of diet on neurodegeneration in
SOD1G93A mice
For CR SOD1G93A mice, the mean Æ SEM
food intake was 2.2 Æ 0.1 g/day,
70 Journal of International Medical Research 43(1)
corresponding to 60% of the food intake for
AL SOD1G93A mice (3.7 Æ 0.1 g/day); the
food intake for HFD SOD1G93A mice was
2.7 Æ 0.2 g/day (Figure 4B). At P120, CR
SOD1G93A mice weighed 21% less than AL
SOD1G93A mice (15.6 Æ 1.5 g versus 19.8 Æ
2.0 g) (Figure 4A and 4C), while HFD
SOD1G93A mice weighed 26% more than
AL SOD1G93A mice (24.9 Æ 1.8 g versus
19.8 Æ 2.0 g) (Figure 4C). Fat body mass
was increased in HFD SOD1G93A mice
relative to AL SOD1G93A mice (6.3 Æ 0.7 g
versus 2.2 Æ 0.4 g) (Figure 4D), but there
were no differences in lean body mass (18.4 Æ
0.5 g versus 17.8 Æ 0.4 g) (Figure 4E). CR
SOD1G93A mice had significantly lower fat
body mass and lean body mass relative to
AL SOD1G93A mice (Figure 4D and 4E).
Compared with AL SOD1G93A mice,
disease onset was delayed by 7 days in
HFD SOD1G93A mice (P ¼ 0.001), but was
significantly hastened by 10 days in CR
SOD1G93A mice (P ¼ 0.003) (Figure 5A).
Similarly, HFD SOD1G93A mice had an
extended lifespan (P < 0.001) and CR
SOD1G93A mice had a decreased lifespan
(P < 0.001) compared with AL SOD1G93A
mice (Figure 5B). Median survival times for
HFD, AL and CR SOD1G93A mice were
148, 128 and 116 days, respectively.

Discussion
Several defects of energy metabolism occur
in ALS, including weight loss, hypermeta-
bolism and hyperlipidaemia.5 Recurrent
reports have indicated that these changes
are potentiated by the co-occurrence of a
mitochondrial defect.5 SOD1G93A mice have
been shown to have dysfunctional mito-
chondria and reduced levels of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) production, compared
with wild-type mice.20 AMPK is activated
by reduced ATP production; once activated,
AMPK can directly and indirectly regulate
transcriptional processes through
phosphorylation.
In the present study, AMPK activity was
increased and Hsp70 expression was

downregulated in spinal cord and hindlimb
muscle samples in AL SOD1G93A mice
compared with SOD1WT mice. Increased
AMPK phosphorylation in AL SOD1G93A
mice compared with wild-type controls has
been confirmed in spinal cord tissue, with
accumulation of pAMPK seen in cytoplas-
mic granules within motor neurons, but also
in peripheral tissues, liver and kidney.21 The
involvement of AMPK in the modulation of
heat shock protein gene expression is a novel
mechanism of metabolic stress; several stu-
dies have confirmed that AMPK activation
produces negative effects by inhibiting the
expression of Hsp70, while AMPK inhib-
ition produces neuroprotective effects via
the enhancement of Hsp70 expression in
stroke models.22 The mechanisms that con-
nect AMPK activation to Hsp70 expression
require further investigation. Heat shock
proteins are molecular chaperones that
assist in the proper folding of newly synthe-
sized proteins and proteins subjected to
stress-induced denaturation.23 In contrast
to other heat shock proteins, Hsp70 has
been identified in almost all of the intracel-
lular compartments.24 Motor neurons have
a weakened capacity to upregulate Hsp70
under stress conditions, making them more
susceptible to cell damage.25 Overexpression
of Hsp70 reduced apoptosis in cerebral
ischaemia and increased expression of the
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.23 Exogenous
delivery of Hsp70 extended the lifespan of

SOD1G93A mice by reducing mutant SOD1
aggregate formation, indicating an import-
ant protective effect for this protein in
ALS.26 In the present study, AL
SOD1G93A mice had significantly lower
expression of Hsp70 than SOD1WT mice,
indicating that they were less protected from
metabolic stress. Therefore, AMPK activa-
tion, resulting in Hsp70 downregulation,
may be harmful in ALS.
The main purposes of the present study
were to establish whether AMPK activation
and the resulting detrimental effects could be
altered by dietary changes in SOD1G93A
mice. CR SOD1G93A mice showed reduced
weight and fat body mass, increased AMPK
activity, downregulated Hsp70 expression,
increased loss of motor neurons, hastened
disease onset and decreased lifespan
compared with AL SOD1G93A mice.

After long-term calorie restriction, increased
AMPK activity has been identified in skel-
etal muscle in mice;27 in the present study a
similar change was noted in spinal cord
tissue, suggesting that calorie restriction-
induced AMPK activation may have
adverse effects in ALS. Others have reported
that calorie restriction shortens lifespan
through reductions in mitochondria, protein
oxidation and stress responses (Hsp70) in
skeletal muscle in SOD1G93A mice.28 The
present study also documented downregula-
tion of Hsp70 expression in CR SOD1G93A
mice, suggesting that AMPK activation
resulting in Hsp70 downregulation may be
the mechanism behind the accelerated clin-
ical onset and disease progression associated
with calorie restriction.
In contrast, in the present study HFD
SOD1G93A mice showed increased weight
and fat body mass, inhibition of AMPK
activity, upregulated Hsp70 expression,
decreased loss of motor neurons, delayed
disease onset and extended survival com-
pared with AL SOD1G93A mice. Others have
reported that a high-fat diet inhibited
AMPK activity and that this corresponded
to significant increases in leptin and glucose
levels.29 The present study results are con-
sistent with those of a report showing that a
high-fat diet increased fat storage, improved
motor neuronal function and extended life-
span in SOD1G93A mice.30 The present
results also showed that a highf-at diet was
associated with decreased activity of AMPK
and increased Hsp70 expression. As reduced
AMPK activity has been shown to be pro-
tective in genetic models of motor neuron
disease,31 this may be part of the mechanism
by which a high-fat diet protects motor
neurons in SOD1G93A mice but not in
mutant TDP-43 mice;21 this difference is
likely to be due to different energy metabol-
ism characteristics in these models.
In summary, the present study showed
that AMPK activity is increased and Hsp70
expression is downregulated in spinal cord
and hindlimb muscle of SOD1G93A mice
compared with SOD1WT mice, in a manner
that can be predictably altered by diet. A
high-fat diet inhibited AMPK activity and
motor neuron loss, upregulated Hsp70
expression, delayed disease onset and
extended the lifespan of SOD1G93A mice,
but calorie restriction produced opposite
results. These findings suggest AMPK-
induced Hsp70 downregulation is a novel
mechanism in the pathogenesis of ALS. The
underlying mechanisms responsible for
AMPK activity and motor neuron
loss require further study. Inhibition of
AMPK may provide a therapeutic strategy
for ALS.
