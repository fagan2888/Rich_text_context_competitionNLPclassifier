Abstract. Various Op artists have used simple geometrical patterns to create the illusion of motion
in their artwork. One explanation for the observed illusion involves retinal shifts caused by small
involuntary eye movements that observers make while they try to maintain fixation. Earlier studies
have suggested a prominent role of the most conspicuous of these eye movements, small rapid
position shifts called microsaccades. Here, we present data that could expand this view with a
different interpretation. In three experiments, we recorded participants' eye movements while they
tried to maintain visual fixation when being presented with variants of Bridget Riley's Fall, which
were manipulated such as to vary the strength of induced motion. In the first two experiments, we
investigated the properties of microsaccades for a set of stimuli with known motion strengths. In
agreement with earlier observations, microsaccade rates were unaffected by the stimulus pattern and,
consequently, the strength of induced motion illusion. In the third experiment, we varied the stimulus
pattern across a larger range of parameters and asked participants to rate the perceived motion
illusion. The results revealed that motion illusions in patterns resembling Riley's Fall are perceived
even in the absence of microsaccades, and that the reported strength of the illusion decreased with
the number of microsaccades in the trial. Together, the three experiments suggest that other sources
of retinal image instability than microsaccades, such as slow oculomotor drift, should be considered
as possible factors contributing to the illusion.
Keywords: Op Art, visual illusions, eye movements, microsaccades, motion perception.
1 Introduction
Visual illusions have received considerable interest, one reason being that they may provide
an important source of information about the working of the human visual system. One
type of illusion that has been studied extensively is illusory motion, such as instances in
which a static image results in a strong motion percept, although no physical motion is
present. These illusions were used by artists as a way to convey motion in images composed
of simple black and white patterns. One example, which will be the focus of the present study,
is the painting Fall by the Op artist Bridget Riley, in which an ensemble of black and white
undulating lines induces a strong motion percept, often reported as a 'shimmering' motion.
Other motion illusions, with possibly different underlying mechanisms or combinations of
underlying mechanisms, exist, such as the Enigma illusion, consisting of radial lines with
superimposed rings (Leviant 1982; Troncoso et al 2008).
Works of arts like Riley's Fall and the Enigma illusion have received considerable interest
from vision scientist debating the origin of the perceived motion illusions in static patterns.
Three possible causes of the illusion have been discussed in the last half century (for a
review, see Troncoso et al 2008). First, it was proposed that the illusions were caused by
the accommodation movements of the eyes (eg, Campbell and Robson 1958), as, in some
situations, the illusion was abolished when looking through a pinhole (Gregory 1993, 1994).
Second, ruling out retinal causes when different patterns of brain activation were found for
real and illusory motion, cortical mechanism have been proposed to underlie such illusions
(Zeki et al 1993; Zeki 1994). Finally, it has been suggested that small eye movements during
Op Art and gaze stability 283
visual fixation, known as fixational eye movements, play an important role in the illusion
(Troncoso et al 2008; Zanker and Walker 2004).
We here focus on the role of fixational eye movements. These eye movements during
visual fixation can be classified into three categories (eg, Martinez-Conde 2006; Martinez-
Conde et al 2004, 2009; Rolfs 2009). First, there are microsaccades, which are movements of
the eye during attempted fixation of a relatively large amplitude (but generally less than 1 deg
of visual angle) and high velocity. Microsaccades tend to occur in both eyes simultaneously
and appear to have properties similar to saccadic eye movements (Otero-Milan et al 2008).
Second, there is slow oculomotor drift, which are also relatively large movements of the eye,
but with velocities that are much smaller than those observed for microsaccades. Third, there
is tremor, which are fast but small amplitude eye movements, which can occur in just one
eye at a time. Microsaccades have been implicated in motion illusions (Troncoso et al 2008;
Zanker and Walker 2004), but slow drift is also suspected to play a role (Zanker and Walker
2004). The contribution of microsaccades to the motion illusion in, for example, the painting
Fall can be understood as follows. During microsaccadic displacements of the eyes, the
projected image is shifted across the retina. Because of the particular pattern of alternating
black and white curves in the painting, the human motion system interprets these shifts as
motion, rather than changes in the direction of eye gaze (Zanker and Walker 2004). A second
mechanism, however, could also play a role. Microsaccades are known to help prevent fading
of the retinal image (eg, Martinez-Conde et al 2006). As a consequence, microsaccades could
induce a transient spiking response of neural activity, which could add to the illusion of
motion in the images.
Several lines of research provided evidence for the role of microsaccades in motion
illusions. First, it has been shown that the motion illusion in patterns resembling Riley's Fall
is weakened when the retinal image is stabilized, for example, by presenting the artwork as
an after-image (Zanker et al 2003). Second, a direct relation was found between the strength
of the streaming-like motion in the Enigma illusion and the occurrence of microsaccades
(Troncoso et al 2008). Finally, computational modelling of motion perception in patterns
resembling Riley's Fall suggested that the alternating patterns of black and white curves
in this illusion induced a large range of motion directions for displacements of the retinal
image, in agreement with the suggestion that the human motion system is confused by
images inducing illusory motion. Control images, in contrast, induced only a single direction
of motion, corresponding to the direction of the retinal shift (Zanker and Walker 2004).
Whereas findings such as those described above provide compelling evidence that
microsaccades can be sufficient to facilitate the perception of illusory motion, it needs
to be kept in mind that microsaccades occur at a relatively rare rate. Most studies report
frequencies in human observers under standard conditions in the order of one microsaccade
per second (eg, Engbert and Kliegl 2003b). As a consequence, the duration of the interval
between microsaccades can be relatively long, and it is rather possible that no microsaccades
occur during brief stimulus presentations, while motion illusions have been found for stimuli
presented as briefly as 250ms (Zanker et al 2010). Given the relatively low frequency of
microsaccades, it therefore needs to be assumed that their effects on the motion system are
reasonably long-lasting if they were the full explanation of the motion illusion.
1.1 The analysis of fixational eye movements
Several algorithms have been used to analyze eye movement recordings for microsaccades.
However, in direct comparisons these have been reported to provide similar results (Otero-
Millan et al 2008; Poletti and Rucci 2010; Troncoso et al 2008). In our study, we employ
the often used algorithm developed by Engbert and Kliegl (2003b). In this algorithm, the
overall noise in the velocity of the eye is estimated from the two-dimensional distribution
284 F Hermens, J Zanker
of instantaneous horizontal and vertical speed components (Figure 1; bottom panels). The
velocity of the eye at each point in time is then compared to a threshold derived from the
amount of noise. Signals that exceed the threshold for some amount of time, and that occur
binocularly (ie, in both eyes simultaneously), are classified as microsaccades which can be
easily verified in two-dimensional position diagrams (Figure 1; top panels, green segments
of eye trajectory). Microsaccades detected with this algorithm follow the main sequence
(Figure 1b), an approximately linear relation between the amplitude of the saccade and the
peak velocity of the eye movement (Zuber et al 1965), suggesting that microsaccades are
generated by a similar mechanism as are regular saccades (Hafed et al 2009).
1.2 The influence of Op Art on fixational eye movements
As indicated above, considerable evidence points towards the involvement of fixational eye
movements in the occurrence of visual motion illusions (eg, Laubrock et al 2008; Troncoso et
al 2008; Zanker et al 2003; Zanker and Walker 2004). An additional process, however, could
also be at work. Because of the motion signals that motion illusions seem to induce in the
visual system system (Zanker 2004), it could also be possible that the additional fixational
instability is induced by the illusion itself, increasing the number and/or amplitude of
different types of fixational eye movements. If such increased fixational instability occurs, it
is expected that when the strength of illusory motion of a stimulus increases, more fixational
eye movements can be found. In a study comparing stimuli inducing weak and strong motion
illusions, no increase in microsaccades was found (Zanker et al 2003; Zanker and Walker
2004), suggesting no link between the perceived motion illusion and fixational instability
(see also Troncoso et al 2008). We here investigate this issue further by inspecting aspects of
microsaccades going beyond their frequency, such as amplitudes and directions for patterns
that elicit different illusion strengths (Experiments 1 and 2). Moreover, we will make a direct
comparison of the perceived motion illusion and the occurrence of microsaccades, by asking
participants to first fixate a stimulus for a fixed interval and then to rate the perceived motion
strength (Experiment 3). By comparing trials with many and trials with few microsaccades,
the relation between microsaccades and perceived illusory motion can be examined.
We conducted three experiments. In the first two experiments, we made use of stimuli
introduced in a previous study, and of which the strength of the perceived illusion was
therefore known beforehand (Zanker et al 2010). The study by Zanker and colleagues provided
a new psychophysical method to measure the strength of illusory motion perceived when
looking at synthetic versions of Riley's Fall (called `Riloids'), which vary in the spatial layout
of the undulating lines, as illustrated in Figure 2. A critical element of the psychophysical
method was an independent manipulation of illusion strength by mixing Riloids with regular
arrays of high-contrast squares that on their own are perceived as firmly static (illustrated
in Figure 3b). The main finding of the study was that the strength of the motion illusion
grows with the amplitude (A) and the spatial period (Âµ) of the wave-like undulations of the
line gratings, but was unaffected by the spatial wavelength of the gratings (). In addition,
we observed that the strength of the motion illusion was not influenced by the presence or
absence of a fixation target (Zanker et al 2010). This latter finding provides an interesting
opportunity to determine how the motion illusion relates to certain aspects of fixational eye
movements. For example, if it were found that the presence of a fixation target increases the
frequency of microsaccades, without affecting motion illusion strength, this would suggest
that the exact frequency of microsaccades is not directly related to observing the illusion.
These predictions were further tested in a third experiment, in which we used a broad range of
Riloid patterns, varying several stimulus parameters. Because of this large range of randomly
presented stimuli, we could ask participants to rate the strength of the illusion on each trial,
without giving them an opportunity to base their responses mainly on their impression of
Op Art and gaze stability 285

have often been shown to follow the main sequence--an approximately linear relation between the
amplitude of the eye movement and the peak velocity. This linear relation is also found for the present
set of data (observations for Experiment 1, 2, and 3, shown in red, blue, and green, respectively).
the stimulus layout, by trying to respond as consistently as possible (as could, for example,
occur for mixtures of Riloids and checker patterns, where observers might rate the strength of
the checker pattern in the background rather than the perceived motion illusion per se). By
obtaining ratings for the strength of the perceived motion and by recording eye movements
on every single trial, a more stringent association could be obtained between the occurrence
of microsaccades and the motion illusion.

showing the influence of different parameters on the pattern: phase modulation amplitude A, phase
modulation wavelength Âµ, and grating period . In psychophysical experiments (Zanker et al 2010), it
was shown that variations of the amplitude (A) and the spatial period of phase modulation (Âµ) affected
the strength of the illusion, whereas the spatial wavelength () had little effect.
2 Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we investigated whether characteristics of microsaccades are related to the
strength of the motion illusion. To vary the strength of the illusion, different contrast ratios
were used for a mixture of a regular array of squares with a Riloid pattern (see Figure 3; for
details, see Zanker et al 2010). Participants were asked to maintain fixation while looking at
an image, first presented together with a fixation target, which was later removed.
2.1 Methods
2.1.1 Participants
Seven participants took part in Experiment 1. Four participants were naive with respect to the
purpose of the experiment, whereas the others (three lab members) had heard about the aim
of the experiment before taking part in it. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal
vision and gave their informed consent before taking part in the study, which was approved
by the local ethics committee.
2.1.2 Apparatus
Stimuli were presented on a 21 inch CRT screen (refresh rate of 100Hz) controlled by an AMD
Athlon 2400+ PC using the Experimental Builder software package (SR Research Osgood, ON,
Canada). Binocular eye movements were recorded with an Eyelink II system (SR Research
Osgood, ON, Canada) at a rate of 500Hz (pupil only mode) by means of a second, Pentium 4,
PC. The Eyelink II system allows for eye movements to be recorded at a spatial resolution of
less than 0.01 degrees and an accuracy of at least 0.5 degrees. A standard 9-point calibration
route was performed before each 12th trial. An additional drift correction preceded each
trial, in which participants were asked to fixate a centrally presented fixation target and press
Op Art and gaze stability 287
the spacebar of a computer keyboard, to correct for drift in the recorded eye position due
to possible slippage of the head-band to which the cameras of the system were mounted.
Participants viewed the computer screen from a distance of 57cm, which was maintained by
means of a chin rest.
2.1.3 Stimuli
Figure 3a illustrates the stimulus sequence. Each trial started with a bullseye fixation target
of 1.2 deg, consisting of two rings partitioned in four patches alternating in colour from red
to white, presented at the centre of a white screen. After 3s, a stimulus pattern measuring
23 deg by 23 deg was presented behind the fixation symbol. Another 3s later, the fixation
symbol was removed.
A basic Riloid pattern was constructed using the equations reported earlier (Zanker and
Walker 2004), with a modulation amplitude (A) of 32 pixels and modulation wavelengths (Âµ)
equal to 400 and 130 pixels (top and the bottom, respectively). The grating period () was set
to 8 pixels.
This basic Riloid pattern was mixed with a regular pattern consisting of 16 evenly
distributed squares each measuring 3 deg. The space between the checkers equalled 3 deg
and the distance to the edge was 1.5 deg. Three different weights were used for mixing the
two components, resulting in relative contrasts of 10% to 90%, 50% to 50%, and 90% to 10%
of Riloids and square pattern, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 3b (indicated by the Riloid
contrast in the mixture, c). From an earlier study (Zanker et al 2010), these three combined
patterns were known to induce weak, medium, and strong motion illusions, respectively.
2.1.4 Design
Participants completed a total of 36 trials, which were presented in three different exper-
imental blocks of 12 trials each. In these blocks four trials of each of the three combined
Riloid and square patterns were presented in a random order.
2.1.5 Procedure
Participants started each trial by looking at the central fixation target of the drift correction
procedure and pressing the spacebar on the keyboard in front of them. After releasing
the spacebar, the stimulus sequence shown in Figure 3a was presented. Participants were
instructed to fixate the fixation target and to maintain fixation on this location during the
entire sequence, after which they were free to move their eyes. In addition to maintaining
fixation, participants were asked to avoid blinking until the end of the stimulus presentation.
After the presentation of the sequence, participants could take as much time as they wanted
until starting the next trial. Typically, participants took about 4 to 10s before moving on to
the next trial.
2.1.6 Data analysis
The measured horizontal and vertical gaze positions were analysed for microsaccades using
the algorithm by Engbert and Kliegl (2003b). Microsaccades were defined as movements of
the eye for which the horizontal and vertical velocity exceeded a set criterion, based on the
overall noise in the signal (6 standard deviations of velocity fluctuations), for at least 6ms in
both eyes. An additional amplitude criterion of less than 30 pixels (1.13 degrees) was used,
removing the data from accidental saccades to different areas of the screen.

9s, at a location that was first indicated by a fixation target that was presented on a white background
for 3s, followed by the Riloid pattern (and fixation target) for 3s, after which the fixation symbol was
removed for another three s. (b) Riloid patterns used in Experiment 1, with contrast mixtures between
the Riloid and the square pattern indicated by the contrast of the Riloid component in the mixture,
with c = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9 referring to a 10%, 50%, and 90% component of the Riloid component, respectively.
2.2 Results
Participants made on average 0.91 microsaccades per second, with microsaccade rates
varying from 0.39 to 1.37 per second between participants. Microsaccade rates also varied
substantially within trials, with the highest rate found early after the onset of the fixation
point and the lowest rate at the end of the trial (see Figure 4a), showing an overall decay of
the rate with prolonged fixation (see also, Zanker et al 2003).
Figure 4b illustrates the effect of the fixation condition (fixation symbol only, fixation and
stimulus pattern, stimulus pattern only) and the contrast-ratio in the mixed pattern on the
rate of occurrence of microsaccades across participants. Whereas the fixation condition, or
time in the trial, had a huge effect on the number of microsaccades, no such an effect was
found of the relative contrast of the two components. These observations were confirmed
by a repeated measures analysis of variance, testing these two factors and their interaction,
demonstrating a significant main effect of the fixation condition (F2,12 = 25.8, p < 0.001), in
the absence of a main effect of contrast ratio (F2,12 = 0.59, p = 0.57) or an interaction between
these factors (F4,24 = 0.54, p = 0.95).
Op Art and gaze stability 289
Important for understanding the role of microsaccades in the motion illusion might
not only be the rate but also the amplitude of the microsaccades, because this determines
how far the retinal image shifts during each microsaccade. In Figure 4c a histogram of the
microsaccade amplitudes is plotted as an average across stimulus conditions, trial intervals,
and participants, showing that the majority of the detected microsaccades had amplitudes in
the 0.1 to 0.5 deg range and that few (micro)saccades occurred with amplitudes larger than
the cut-off value of 1.13 deg (or 30 pixels). In Figure 4d the role of the fixation interval and
relative contrast of the two components (Riloid and squares) on the amplitude saccades is
investigated, revealing no effect of either factor, which was confirmed in a repeated measures
analysis of variance (fixation interval: F2,12 = 0.31, p = 0.74; relative contrast: F2,12 = 0.89, p =
0.44; interaction: F4,24 = 0.26, p = 0.90).
A second important variable of gaze stability is the direction of the microsaccades, which
for the illusion determines the direction of the shift of the retinal image. In Figure 4e the
microsaccade rates are shown for the four cardinal directions (rightward, upward, leftward,
downward) for the three stimulus intervals and three different relative contrast of the two
stimulus components. The following observations can be made. First, microsaccade rates
decrease across the three intervals, in agreement with Figures 4a and 4b. Second, more
microsaccades are found in horizontal (leftward, rightward) than in vertical directions
(upward, downward). Third, no systematic differences in the direction of microsaccades are
found for the different contrast conditions. The statistical significance of these observations
was tested using a three-way repeated measures analysis of variance, testing differences in
microsaccade direction (horizontal versus vertical), differences due to the fixation interval
(fixation, stimulus plus fixation and stimulus only), and the relative contrast (c = 0.1, c = 0.5,
c = 0.9). A main effect of the interval was found (F2,12 = 26.12, p < 0.001), as well as a main
effect of the direction of the microsaccade (horizontal versus vertical; F1,6 = 9.67, p = 0.021).
The interaction between the interval and the direction was also significant (F2,12 = 4.23, p =
0.041). The remaining interactions and main effects did not reach significance.
2.3 Discussion
In Experiment 1 we investigated the properties of the small saccadic eye movements during
visual fixation of stimuli that induce illusory motion with varying strength. Our results suggest
that microsaccade properties (rates, amplitudes, directions) are not related to the strength of
the motion illusion. Whereas the particular stimulus pattern did not affect microsaccades,
the rate at which they occurred, varied with the stimulus interval and therefore possibly with
the type visual stimulation (fixation symbol or Riloid). Higher rates were found when the
screen contained just a fixation symbol, whereas lower rates were found when the Riloid
pattern was presented. Microsaccade amplitudes, in contrast, were not significantly different
for the different intervals of visual stimulation.
Our findings agree with earlier observations (Zanker et al 2003; Zanker and Walker 2004),
who found that microsaccade rates were not influenced by the type of visual stimulus (either
a pattern inducing illusory motion, or uniform grey field or checkerboard control patterns
which were perceived as static). Zanker and colleagues (Zanker et al 2003; Zanker and Walker
2004) also observed that during the course of visual fixation the rate of microsaccades
decreased. It is therefore possible that the difference that we observed of the presence of the
fixation symbol could be the consequence of prolonged fixation rather than being related to
the fixation stimulus. This possibility is investigated in a second experiment, in which the
presence or absence is varied across rather than within trials.

standard error of the mean.
3 Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we investigated whether the effects of the fixation symbol found in
Experiment 1 were due to prolonged fixation by varying the presence or absence of the
fixation symbol across trials.
3.1 Methods
Eight new participants took part in the experiment. Except for author FH, participants were
students at Royal Holloway University, taking part in return for course credit.
The stimulus sequence in Experiment 2 is illustrated in Figure 5a. Trials started with the
presentation of a fixation target, after which the composite stimulus pattern appeared. With
the presentation of the stimulus pattern, the fixation symbol either remained (Figure 5a, left)
or was removed from the display (Figure 5a, right).
The basic Riloid pattern was changed with respect to Experiment 1, by setting the
modulation amplitude (A) to 24 (instead of 32) pixels, and the modulation wavelength
Op Art and gaze stability 291
(Âµ) to a constant of 200 pixels across the entire pattern (instead of changing from 400 to
130 pixels from top to bottom) to better match the stimuli used by Zanker et al (2010). In
addition to using a set of stimuli with the same three contrast mixtures as in Experiment 1,
a second set was created in which the overall contrast of the pattern was strongly reduced
(see Figure 5b) to test for the effects of the contrast of the pattern, which has been shown to
strongly affect the motion illusion (Zanker et al 2010). By adding these low-contrast stimuli,
the number of trials doubled to 72 (12 repetition of each of 6 contrast conditions).
Except for the above changes to the design (using two trial intervals), to the basic Riloid
pattern, and the inclusion of the low-contrast stimuli, all methods used in Experiment 2 were
identical to those used in Experiment 1.
Figure 5. (a) Stimulus sequence of Experiment 2. Trials all started with the presentation of a fixation
target for 1s. After presentation of the fixation symbol, the stimulus pattern appeared for 3s, whilst
the fixation target was still present on the screen (left panel, in 50% of the trials) or disappeared
(right panel, in the other 50% of trials). (b) Composite stimulus patterns used in Experiment 2. The
high-contrast patterns (top row) had the same contrast mixtures of Riloids and square patterns as
those used in Experiment 1. Low-contrast stimuli were added, in which the overall contrast of the
stimulus was strongly reduced (bottom row).
3.2 Results
As for Experiment 1, microsaccade rates were found to vary considerably between partici-
pants. The lowest rate observed was 0.52 per second, whereas the largest rate was 1.82 per
second. On average, participants generated 1.08 microsaccades per second. Figure 6 presents
an overview of different microsaccade properties, with the average plots (b, d, e) showing the
data for the high-contrast stimuli. Those for the low-contrast stimuli are shown in Figure 7.
Figure 6a shows the microsaccade rate as a function of the time after the onset of the trial,
based on the data across all conditions, displaying a pattern quite similar to that observed
for Experiment 1. Just after the onset of the fixation point, the microsaccade rate shows a
292 F Hermens, J Zanker
short dip, followed by a marked increase. After the onset of the stimulus pattern, a distinct
dip in the rate is found, followed by a shallow rebound and slow drop-off.
Figure 6b plots the microsaccade rate for the different stimulus conditions for the high-
contrast stimuli. The microsaccade rate during the presentation of the fixation target and
white background was remarkably larger than during the presentation of the composite
stimulus (with or without the fixation symbol), in agreement with the data of Experiment
1. This higher rate is likely to be the consequence of the huge rise in the microsaccade
after fixation onset. Interestingly, the rates are also higher during the presentation of the
composite stimulus with the fixation target than without the fixation symbol, demonstrating
that the difference observed in Experiment 1 was not solely due to prolonged fixation. A
repeated measures analysis of variance was used to investigate the statistical significance
of the differences between conditions. A significant main effect of the trial interval (fixation
versus stimulus pattern with or with and fixation symbol) was found (F2,14 = 4.52, p = 0.031),
which did not interact with the relative contrast of Riloid and square pattern (F4,28 = 0.532,
p = 0.71). The relative contrast did not influence the microsaccade rate (F2,14 = 0.82, p =
0.46). When the two stimulus trial sequences are compared, a significant main effect of the
presence of the fixation target is found (F1,7 = 15.1, p = 0.06), in the absence of a main effect
of relative contrast (F2,6 = 1.07, p = 0.40) and an interaction with the relative contrast (F2,6 =
0.32, p = 0.74).
Figure 6c shows a histogram of observed microsaccade amplitudes, showing a similar
pattern to that observed in Experiment 1, with most microsaccades of amplitudes of 0.4 deg
or less. Figure 6d plots the microsaccade amplitude for the different conditions with overall
high-contrast. As in Experiment 1, no clear effects of the interval or trial sequence or relative
contrast on microsaccade amplitude can be detected. This observation was confirmed with
a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), showing non-significant main effects
of the interval--fixation target on white background versus composite stimulus with or
without fixation target (F2,14 = 0.93, p = 0.42), relative contrast (F2,14 = 0.75, p = 0.49), and no
interaction between the two factors (F4,28 = 1.23, p = 0.32). Also, when the two composite
stimulus intervals were compared directly, no significant main effects--with and without
fixation target (F1,7 = 1.09, p = 0.33), relative contrast (F2,14 = 0.93, p = 0.42), or interaction
(F2,14 = 1.17, p = 0.34) were found.
In Figure 6e the microsaccade rates in the different directions (right, down, left, up) are
displayed. Interestingly, no clear bias towards horizontal directions was observed during
the presentation of the fixation target on a white background (left panel). During the
presentation of the composite stimulus (with or without a fixation target; middle and right
panels, respectively), the bias towards the horizontal directions was restored. During the
presentation of the composite stimulus together with the fixation symbol, there appears to
be stronger bias towards the horizontal for the stimuli with low relative contrast. Using a
three-way repeated measures ANOVA, the statistical significance of the differences between
the rates for horizontal and vertical microsaccades as well as the effects of the interval and
the relative contrast were tested. A significant main effect of the interval was found (F2,14
= 5.84, p = 0.014). The main effect of microsaccade direction (horizontal versus vertical),
however, failed to reach significance (F1,7 = 5.25, p = 0.056). The interactions and the main
effect of relative contrast were not statistically significant either.
In Figure 7 we investigate whether the pattern of results changes by changing the overall
contrast of the stimuli. Whereas the microsaccade rates are very similar to those observed
for the high overall contrast stimuli, the microsaccade amplitudes show an increase during
the presentation of the Riloid without a fixation point. As for the high-contrast stimuli, the
only factor that significantly affected microsaccades rates for the low-contrast stimuli was

the interval/fixation condition (F2,14 = 4.52, p = 0.031). This effect on the microsaccade rate
was not due to to the interval alone. When the two stimulus conditions (with and without
a fixation symbol presented together with the stimulus pattern) were compared, a main
effect of the fixation stimulus was found (F1,7 = 15.07, p = 0.006), whereas no effect of the
relative contrast or an interaction was found (both p-values > 0.48). A repeated analysis of
variance on the saccade amplitudes revealed a significant main effect of the interval/fixation
condition (fixation target only versus composite stimulus with or without fixation target;
F2,14 = 7.18, p = 0.007), as well as a main effect of relative contrast (F2,14 = 3.76, p = 0.049). The
interaction between the two factors did not reach significance (F4,28 = 1.91, p = 0.14). When
the two composite stimulus conditions were compared, a main effect of fixation target on
microsaccade amplitude was found (F1,7 = 7.70, p = 0.027). The interaction with the relative
contrast failed to reach significance (F2,14 = 1.49, p = 0.259). The main effect of the relative
294 F Hermens, J Zanker
contrast on microsaccade amplitudes, however, was significant (F2,14 = 5.57, p = 0.017). The
pattern of results for microsaccade directions was similar to that found for the high-contrast
stimuli, with one exception. Whereas for the high-contrast stimuli the difference between
the rates for horizontal and vertical microsaccades did not reach significance, the main effect
of direction was significant for the low-contrast stimuli (F1,7 = 6.66, p = 0.036). As for the
high-contrast stimuli, the main effect of the interval/fixation stimulus was significant for
the low-contrast stimuli (F2,14 = 4.28, p = 0.036). The remaining interaction and main effects
were not significant.

4 Experiment 3
One of the explanations of illusory motion in stimuli like Riley's Fall involves the shift of
the retinal image caused by microsaccades. Such retinal shifts induce a complex pattern
in the human motion system, which resembles the subjective experience of a shimmering
motion in the illusion (Zanker 2004; Zanker et al 2010). To test this explanation of illusory
motion in Fall, we investigated the relation between the illusion strength and properties of
microsaccades occurring during the inspection of the image in Experiments 1 and 2. Stimuli
with known illusion strengths from a previous study (from Zanker et al 2010) were used, and
microsaccade properties were examined across the different images. No clear differences
were found in the patterns of microsaccades for the different stimuli reflecting different
motion illusion strengths, suggesting that rates, amplitudes and directions of microsaccades
are not associated with the strength of the motion illusion. One possible issue, however, could
be that by relying on stimuli with known illusion strengths, small trial by trial fluctuations in
the perceived motion strength might not be detectable. In Experiment 3, we therefore took a
Op Art and gaze stability 295
larger set of stimuli (by varying several parameters of the Riloids, without any checkers in
the background), so that we could ask participants to rate the perceived illusion strength
on a trial by trial basis, without risking that participants would respond to each stimulus
in a stereotyped way by memorizing the previously given response for a certain stimulus.
This larger set of stimuli therefore had the advantage that participants might report trial
by trial variations in the perceived motion strength, possibly caused by differences in the
fixational eye movements made on that trial. By comparing trials with few and trials with
many microsaccades, it can be investigated whether retinal shifts from microsaccades are an
important factor in the motion illusion in Riley's Fall or whether other explanations of the
illusion might be required.
4.1 Methods
Fourteen new participants and author FH participated in Experiment 3, resulting in a total
of fifteen participants (thirteen female, average age 19.3 years). The new participants were
students from the University of Leuven taking part in return for course credit. The apparatus
was very similar to that used in Experiments 1 and 2. An Eyelink II system (the same model
as in Experiments 1 and 2) was used to record the eye movements. Stimuli were presented on
a 21 inch CRT screen (Iiyama HM204DT), at a refresh rate of 75Hz (100Hz in Experiments 1
and 2). Participants were seated at a distance of 60 cm from the screen (57 cm in Experiments
1 and 2), maintained by a chin rest.
Stimuli were constructed using the equations from Zanker et al (2003), in which the
modulation amplitude (A) was set to either of 6 or 36 pixels (minimum and maximum values
tested by Zanker et al 2010, respectively), the modulation period (Âµ) to either 100 or 400 (top
and the bottom had the same modulation periods), and the overall contrast (c) either to 0.1,
0.5, or 0.9 (10%, 50%, and 90% of maximum contrast, respectively). The grating wavelength
() was set to same values as in Experiments 1 and 2, namely 8 pixels. The size of the stimuli
was kept at 600 pixels (22.9 by 22.9 deg of visual angle; cf, 23.0 by 23.0 degrees in Experiments
1 and 2). Each of the resulting 12 stimuli was presented six times to each participant, resulting
in 72 trials per participant, three times with a fixation point superimposed on the image and
three times without the fixation point.
Before the start of the experiment, participants performed at least 5 practice trials,
randomly chosen from the set of 72 trials. During these practice trials, it was made sure
that participants maintained fixation during the presentation of the stimuli. The practice
trials also allowed participants to obtain an impression of the types of stimuli and their
elicited motion illusions so that they could establish a baseline to determine what to consider
as strong and weak motion illusions.
The trial structure was the same as in Experiment 2, with the fixation point presented for
1s, before the stimulus was presented for 3s (with or without the fixation point superimposed).
After the offset of the stimulus, participants were asked to indicate the strength of the motion
illusion induced by the stimulus on a three point scale (1 = weak, 2 = medium, 3 = strong
motion illusion). Feedback after their button press confirmed their choice. Every 12 trials,
participants were allowed a short break before continuing with the remainder of the trials.
4.2 Results
Figure 8 provides an overview of the motion illusion ratings of the participants. Generally,
participants more often responded with lower values for the perceived motion strength (top
left plot; F1,14 = 7.37, p = 0.003; linear contrast). The subsequent subplots of Figure 8 show how
the average rating depended on the different parameters of the stimuli and presentation. In
line with earlier studies (Zanker et al 2003; Zanker et al 2010), larger values for the modulation
amplitude (A) resulted in higher ratings of the perceived illusion strength (t14 = 2.45, p
= 0.028). Also in line with earlier observations (Zanker et al 2010), lower values for the
296 F Hermens, J Zanker
modulation period (Âµ) led to lower average ratings of the illusion (t14 = 12.20, p < 0.001).
Higher contrasts (c) led to higher reported motion strengths (F1,14 = 4.77, p = 0.046; linear
contrast), in agreement with earlier findings (Zanker et al 2010). The presence of the fixation
symbol did not significantly influence the strength of the illusion (t15 = 1.93, p = 0.074), in
agreement with earlier observations, showing that similar results are obtained when the
fixation point is shown in between two stimuli (Zanker et al 2010) or in the centre of a single
stimulus (present study).
Figure 8. Average ratings and response frequencies for Experiment 3. The top-left plot shows the
relative frequency of the different ratings across observers, showing a bias towards weaker (rating of
1 or 2) reported illusion strengths. The remaining plots show the average rating as a function of the
different parameter values or conditions. The middle plots show that stronger ratings are obtained
for stimuli with larger modulation amplitudes (`A') and smaller modulation periods (`Âµ'). The bottom
plots shows a significant, but weaker effect of the contrast (`c'), and no significant effect of the presence
(or absence) of a fixation point.
Figure 9 provides an overview of the microsaccade findings, linking the ratings on each
trial to the frequency and amplitude of the microsaccades. The frequency of microsaccades
during the trial (Figure 9a) showed a similar profile as in Experiment 2 (Figure 6a), showing
two responses: One to the onset of the fixation symbol (t = 0ms; left of red line) and one to
the onset of the Riloid stimulus (t=1000ms; right of red line). Whereas we found no influence
of the strength of the illusion in the previous two experiments, the trial by trial analysis of
Experiment 3 revealed an inverse relation between the perceived strength of the motion
illusion and the microsaccade rate. For example, it was found that microsaccades were
more often completely absent (0 microsaccades in a 3s interval; Figure 9b) when the illusion
was rated more strongly (F1,14 = 15.34, p = 0.002; linear contrast). Furthermore, the more
microsaccades were made, the lower the motion illusion ratings (Figure 9c; F1,14 = 8.54,
p = 0.011; linear contrast). Pairwise comparisons between trials with zero microsaccades
and trials with one, two, three, or four microsaccades show that only for trials with two
microsaccades, the difference in the rating of the illusion strength compared to trials with
zero microsaccades fails to reach significance (t14 = 1.99, p = 0.066). For trials with one
(t14 = 2.97, p = 0.010), three (t14 = 3.58, p = 0.0030), and four microsaccades (t14 = 2.45, p =
0.028--although this latter comparison fails to reach statistical significance if the stringent
Op Art and gaze stability 297
Bonferroni correction is applied, setting the critical alpha level to 0.0125, for 4 comparisons),
the average motion illusion rating was always significantly lower compared to trials without
microsaccades.

cade signature' (eg, Engbert and Kliegl 2003b and Experiments 1 and 2) after fixation (t = 0ms) and

the initial rate. (b) The proportion of trials with 0, 1, ..., 10 microsaccades after stimulus onset (t =

showing a similar pattern as in Experiments 1 and 2. (f) The average amplitude of microsaccades (on
trials on which a microsaccade occurred) as a function of the motion illusion rating, showing no effect
of the strength of the illusion.
An examination of the influence of the stimulus parameters on the microsaccade rates
(Figure 9d) confirms the findings from the previous two experiments. Rates were no different
for the different stimulus parameters (modulation amplitude, modulation period or contrast),
but a significant influence of the presence of a fixation point was found (t14 = 2.31, p = 0.037).
298 F Hermens, J Zanker
A similar histogram of observed microsaccade amplitudes as in Experiment 1 and 2 was
found in Experiment 3 (Figure 9e). A comparison of the microsaccade amplitudes (for trials
in which at least one microsaccade was observed) did not reveal an effect of the rated motion
illusion (Figure 9f--F2,28 = 0.11, p = 0.90).
5 General discussion
In three experiments, we investigated involuntary eye movements (`microsaccades') made
by observers who were instructed to maintain fixation while watching parametric versions of
Bridget Riley's Fall (called `Riloids'). The stimulus presentation was varied in several respects.
First, we investigated the influence of mixing the original Riloid with a regular pattern of
squares (Experiments 1 and 2), which has been demonstrated to manipulate the strength of
the motion illusion observed in the image (Zanker et al 2010). Second, the overall contrast of
the image was varied (Experiment 2), another factor that has been shown to strongly influence
the strength of perceived illusory motion (Zanker et al 2010). Third, the influence of a fixation
target was determined, which was present or absent in different intervals (Experiment 1) or
in half of the trials (Experiments 2 and 3) while the stimulus pattern was presented. Previous
psychophysical experiments (Zanker et al 2010) have suggested that such a fixation target
has little influence on the strength of the illusion. Finally, we also included Riloids without
background checkers and varied the modulation amplitude, the modulation period, and the
contrast of the pattern (Experiment 3).
Several properties of microsaccades were examined, including their frequency and
amplitude (Experiments 1 and 2) and their relation to the perceived motion illusion
judgements (Experiment 3). Earlier research (Zanker and Walker 2004) has suggested that
whilst image instability is crucial for the perception of the illusion (the illusion is strongly
reduced when retinal motion is eliminated and simulations with a computational model
suggest that retinal shifts are essential to explain the patterns of motions perceived in the
stimuli), the rate at which microsaccades occur is not directly related to stimulus that is
shown. This observation was confirmed in the present study for a different set of stimuli
which allowed for controlled variations of illusion strength (Experiments 1 and 2). Whether
there is an association between microsaccade frequency and the illusion strength (rather
than the stimulus) was examined in Experiment 3, in which participants were asked to rate
the perceived strength of motion after each trial. This experiment revealed two important
aspects. First, in many trials no microsaccades were detected at all, and even in the absence
of such microsaccades, participants indicated that they perceived illusory motion. Second,
trials with fewer microsaccades were associated with higher ratings for the perceived motion
illusion. The more microsaccades were observed in an individual trial, the lower the average
rating of the motion illusion strength. These observations support the idea raised earlier that
illusion strength is not directly related to the frequency of microsaccades (Zanker and Walker
2004).
In our experiments, we replicated the effects of stimulus onsets on microsaccade rates.
In agreement with earlier observations (eg, Engbert and Kliegl 2003b; Laubrock et al 2005),
stimulus onsets--such as the onset of the fixation symbol or the Riloid--led to an initial
decrease in the rate, followed by a pronounced increase and slow return to baseline. This
pattern in microsaccade rates, known as the `microsaccade signature', was also found for
stimulus onsets in the auditory modality (Rolfs et al 2005, 2008) and for partial offsets of
stimuli presented at fixation (Hermens et al 2010).
Another factor that influenced the microsaccade rate was the presence of a fixation
target, which may provide some clues about the role of microsaccades in gaze control. Fewer
microsaccades were found when the fixation target was absent. This was the case when
Op Art and gaze stability 299
the fixation target was present in the initial stimulus phase and was removed in the later
stimulus phase (Experiment 1), and also, albeit to a lesser degree, when a direct comparison
between trials with and without a fixation symbol was made (Experiments 2 and 3). This
latter comparison excludes an explanation suggesting prolonged fixation as the cause of
the reduction in microsaccades (Zanker and Walker 2004) rather than the presence of the
fixation target. A possible explanation for the increased microsaccade rate with a fixation
target could be that microsaccades serve to bring the eye back to fixation after periods of
drift (Ditchburn and Ginsborg 1953; Poletti and Rucci 2010; Otero-Millan et al 2008). When a
fixation target is present, such drifts are more obvious (one finds gaze is no longer directed
towards the fixation symbol), which could explain why more microsaccades--as means of
redirecting gaze to the point of origin after drifting away--occur. Such an explanation agrees
with findings by Otero-Millan and colleagues (2008), who showed that microsaccades were
less frequent when observers were viewing a blank screen, compared to when they were
viewing an image, suggesting that microsaccades require visual stimuli to `anchor' to (Otero-
Millan et al 2008, page 8). Alternatively, participants might have performed two different tasks
with or without a fixation target. When a fixation target was present, they might have tried to
keep their direction of gaze as close as possible to the target. Without the fixation target, this
might no longer be a tenable strategy, and instead, they might have tried to keep their eyes
as still as possible. With these two different tasks, to maintain fixation or to try to keep the
eyes still, different microsaccade rates have been observed previously (Steinman et al 1973),
with lower microsaccade rates for keeping the eyes still than for maintaining fixation, which
could therefore provide an explanation for our observed differences in rates. The importance
of a fixation target for the occurrence of microsaccades was also demonstrated by Poletti
and Rucci (2010), who found, in line with the work by Cornsweet (1956), that microsaccade
rates were unaffected by the (perceived) fading of the retinal image, suggesting that the
actual presence or absence of a visual stimulus is not what determines the microsaccade rate.
Moreover, they observed that removing the fixation target and instead asking participants
to maintain fixation within a certain region (`relaxed fixation' requirement) reduced the
number of microsaccades. Furthermore, they found that the direction of microsaccades in
the presence of a fixation target was negatively correlated with the direction of the preceding
oculomotor drift, while such a correlation was not found without a fixation target. These
observations suggest a possible role of microsaccades in correcting for fixation errors under
high-accuracy fixation requirements (see, also, Engbert and Kliegl 2004).
A second aspect of the microsaccades that we investigated was their amplitude. Whereas
microsaccade rates have been studied extensively, fewer studies have looked into microsac-
cade amplitudes. It has been suggested (eg, Steinmann et al 1973) that larger amplitude
microsaccades are found under conditions with more oculomotor drift (suggesting a function
to bring the eye back to the intended point of fixation). In addition, it has been found that
when fewer microsaccades occur, for example, after the onset of a visual stimulus, their
amplitudes tend to be smaller (Rolfs et al 2008). Furthermore, saccadic latencies were found
to be longer when preceded by larger amplitude microsaccades (Rolfs et al 2008). Moreover,
the size of microsaccades was found to depend on whether the microsaccade occurred as
a single event or was part of a sequence of microsaccades (Laubrock et al 2010). Another
study found that fading of the stimulus did not influence the amplitude of microsaccades
(Poletti and Rucci 2010). Our study adds to these findings by investigating the role of a
fixation stimulus and the type of visual stimulation (in particular, the strength of illusory
motion induced by the stimulus). Whereas microsaccade rates were strongly influenced by
the presence of a fixation stimulus, microsaccade amplitudes were only weakly affected. This
suggests that a tight coupling between microsaccade amplitudes and rates (Rolfs et al 2008)
300 F Hermens, J Zanker
might not always occur. Moreover, it also suggests that larger amounts of oculomotor drift
could be compensated for by more rather than larger amplitude microsaccades. With respect
to visual stimulation, an opposite pattern of results was found. Whilst microsaccade rates
were unaffected by patterns increasing the strength of the motion illusion, the microsaccade
amplitude appeared to be modulated by this manipulation. The pattern of results, however,
was complex. No modulation of the amplitude was found when the stimulus was presented
at the end of a long interval of fixation (Experiment 1). When part of a shorter interval
(Experiment 2), the influence appeared to be non-monotonically related to the strength of
the illusion, with stronger influences for patterns inducing weak or strong motion illusion
strengths. Experiment 3, however, suggests that the association between the illusion strength
and microsaccade amplitude from Experiment 2 might actually be an association between
the strength of the checker pattern and microsaccade amplitude. In this third experiment,
in which participants rated the perceived motion illusion on each trial, the microsaccade
amplitude appeared to be unrelated to ratings of perceived motion strength. Possibly, the
checkers in the background acted as `anchor points' for fixation stability, just like a fixation
point, making it more obvious the eye has drifted. In this context, it should be noted, however,
that computational simulations (Zanker 2004) suggest that all saccadic displacements larger
than /4 (about 0.1 deg in the present stimuli) would lead to substantial motion illusions.
Therefore the amplitude modulation in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 deg may have little effect on
illusion strength, as displacements in this range are larger than the minimum displacement
required for the illusion (about 0.1 deg).
A third aspect we investigated was the direction of the microsaccades. Previous research
has suggested that the direction of microsaccades is influenced by the direction of covert
attention (Engbert and Kliegl 2003b; Laubrock et al 2005; Laubrock et al 2008). In addition,
microsaccades have often been found to be biased towards the horizontal direction (eg, Eng-
bert and Kliegl 2003a; Hermens and Walker 2010). In contrast, Zanker and colleagues (Zanker
et al 2003; Zanker and Walker2004) found a horizontal bias only for certain participants,
whereas other observers displayed a bias towards vertical microsaccade directions. The
present findings are in agreement with those from Engbert, Kliegl, and colleagues, showing a
significant bias towards the horizontal direction, with leftward and rightward microsaccades
being more frequent than upward and downward microsaccades. In addition, the direction
of microsaccades was unrelated to the strength of the illusion elicited by particular stimulus
patterns. The discrepancy of the results between Engbert, Kliegl, and colleagues; our present
findings; and those from Zanker and colleagues could lie in the algorithm used to detect
microsaccades. The former set of results were based on an algorithm detecting microsaccades
on the basis of a velocity criterion applied to signals from both eyes, whereas the latter results
were obtained using a detection criterion based on accelerations applied to the signal of
one eye only. The difference in the algorithm is also reflected in a difference in the observed
rates, with studies applying the algorithm by Engbert and Kliegl (2003b) reporting a rate
of 1 microsaccade per second, and the study applying the acceleration criterion (Zanker
et al 2003) observing a rate of 2 microsaccades per second. It is reassuring, however, that
only the absolute rate and the distributions of directions seem to depend on the detection
algorithm (see also Otero-Millan et al 2008; Poletti and Rucci 2010 and Troncoso et al 2008,
who applied different algorithms to the same dataset and found no differences in results),
whereas other aspects, such as differences in microsaccade rates across conditions, appear
to be unaffected. Note, however, that our observation of no microsaccades in the presence of
an illusion could possible depend on the ability of the algorithm and eye tracking equipment
to detect microsaccades. Possibly, microsaccades occurred on the relevant trials, but the
Op Art and gaze stability 301
algorithm was not able to detect them (although the observed rates around 1Hz are well in
line with earlier observations; Martinez-Conde et al 2009).
The present results cast doubts on an interpretation in which retinal shifts caused by
microsaccades produce the illusion of shimmering motion perceived in parametric versions
of Fall. First, we found that on a large number of trials, no microsaccades were observed
(Experiment 3). On these trials, however, clear motion illusions were reported by participants.
This finding quantifies an observation that already pointed at a possibility of motion illusions
without microsaccades. Earlier, Zanker et al (2010) found that the strength of the illusion
was relatively unaffected by the presentation duration of the stimulus. For stimuli presented
as briefly as 250 ms, motion illusions were found--at a typical rate of 1 microsaccade per
second (eg, Engbert and Kliegl 2003b), microsaccades might not have occurred on a few trials
of such short presentation durations. Note, however, that the finding of motion illusions in
the absence of microsaccades in itself is not sufficient to conclude that microsaccades do not
play a role in the illusion. The reason is that it cannot be excluded that the presentation of
the stimuli by itself might have contributed to the illusion. Possibly, the onset of the stimulus
pattern induced a transient response of visual neurons, which could be involved in perceiving
the illusion, similar to the recurrence of the percept of a faded stimulus after microsaccades
(Martinez-Conde et al 2006). How exactly transients caused by stimulus onsets and induce a
motion illusion, however, is less clear, and should be investigated further, for example, using
computational modelling. Second, the occurrence of microsaccades was found to be either
unrelated (Experiments 1 and 2) or inversely related (stronger motion percepts were found
when fewer microsaccades occurred) to the motion illusion (Experiment 3). In particular this
latter finding of weaker motion illusions with more microsaccades is difficult to reconcile
with an explanation in which microsaccades generate the motion illusion.
Given the above observations, the present results suggest other causes than microsac-
cades for the illusion. For example, it could be possible that other types of fixational eye
movements, such as oculomotor drift, are involved. Alternatively, there might be a role for
perceptual transients, such as the onsets of stimulus patterns, in the illusion. Taking our
findings as a reason to discard fixational eye movements altogether as a factor in the illusion
might be a step too far, however, because earlier evidence strongly suggests the involvement
of fixational eye movements. For example, it has been shown that if the retinal image is
stabilized, the illusion is strongly reduced (Zanker and Walker 2004), which suggests that
retinal instability plays a role in the illusion. Moreover the observed patterns of perceived
motion are well in line with predictions from a motion perception model (Zanker 2004;
Zanker et al 2010), assuming the involvement of retinal shifts, such as those occurring as
a result of fixational eye movements. Oculomotor drift, rather than microsaccades might
be a good candidate for offering an alternative or additional explanation for the illusion.
These movements occur continuously, and therefore do not suffer from the problem of
microsaccades that they might not occur on all trials, or for all presentation durations.
Moreover, they are also relatively large movements of the eyes (Martinez-Conde and Macknik
2008), and could therefore provide the retinal shift assumed in computational models
explaining the illusion (Zanker 2004). Whereas there is evidence that retinal shifts are
important for the illusion (Zanker and Walker 2004), it cannot be excluded that perceptual
transients, such as those caused by stimulus onsets and offsets, also play a role. The
involvement of such perceptual transients in the motion illusion in Riley's Fall could be
further investigated by presenting the stimuli for extended periods of time and to ask
participants to indicate changes in aspects of the perceived motion, such as its speed or
direction (Troncoso et al 2008). Such a presentation paradigm would eliminate perceptual
transients and only leave signals arising from micro-movements of the eyes and eye-blinks.
302 F Hermens, J Zanker
Our experiments revealed no relation between the perceived illusion and the amplitude
of the microsaccades. Such a lack of a relation is well in line with predictions from a motion
detection model. Simulations with such a model (2DMD model, Zanker 2004) show that
the amplitude of the microsaccades is not predicted to hugely influence the strength of
the illusion, except if the microsaccade amplitude becomes very small with respect to the
distance between stripes in the stimulus. The direction of microsaccades does not appear
to be critical for the illusion either. Microsaccades are typically found to be biased towards
the horizontal direction. If the direction of microsaccades would be of importance, it would
therefore be expected that rotating the Riloid would change the strength of the illusion. Such
an effect of the orientation of the pattern has not been observed (Zanker and Walker 2004).
Our conclusion that the rate of microsaccades is not directly related or could be even
inversely related to the strength of the illusion may appear to be at odds with the findings of
Troncoso et al (2008), who found a clear and distinct increase in the number of microsaccades
before a perceived increase in the apparent speed of illusory motion. There are a number of
issues to consider here. First, in our study we presented stimuli for a relatively brief duration,
whereas Troncoso et al (2008) presented their stimuli for extended periods. The onset and
offset of the stimuli in our experiments could have caused transient neural responses, which
might have contributed to the illusion, in addition to the influence of retinal shifts generated
by fixational eye movements implicated in earlier studies of the illusion (Zanker 2004;
Zanker and Walker 2004). Second, in their study Troncoso and colleagues observed the
increase in the microsaccade before the change in the perceived speed, rather than during
the entire period of increased speed, and therefore the rate change rather than the rate itself
could be responsible for the change in the perception (see Martinez-Conde et al 2006, for
a similar increase in the microsaccade rate before the perceived reappearance of a faded
stimulus). Third, the study by Troncoso et al (2008) might have investigated a different type of
illusory motion. In their study, Troncoso and colleagues investigated the speed of a perceived
streaming illusion elicited by patterns related to Leviant's 'Enigma' stimulus (Leviant 1996),
which might be different in nature from the shimmering motion found for Riloids (eg,
the streaming-like motion in Enigma is found in the bands without patterns, whereas the
shimmering motion in Riloids is linked to clear patterns in the stimulus). Whereas the speed
of illusory motion might be related to the strength of the illusion, as measured by Zanker and
colleagues (Zanker et al 2010; Zanker and Walker 2004), these two measures do not necessarily
need to correlate. Instead, stronger illusions could mean a larger range of directions, or more
direction changes, rather than higher perceived speed. The possible difference between
the two illusions might also involve the underlying mechanism. For example, to perceive
a motion illusion in Riley's Fall, retinal shifts might be important. For the motion illusion
in Leviant's `Engima', such shifts might be less important, and transients generated, for
example, by microsaccades might be more strongly involved. Fourth, our psychophysical
study (Zanker et al 2010), in which we found no effect of the fixation stimulus on the strength
of the illusion (suggesting that microsaccades are not involved in the illusion, as their rate
generally increases with the presentation of a fixation stimulus), did not control for eye
movements. Whereas it was very unlikely that participants made large eye movements in the
condition with the fixation target (only highly trained observers took part in the study, some of
whom demonstrated in the present study that they could well maintain fixation when asked
to do so), it can be expected that they did make eye movements in the condition without
the fixation target. It can therefore not be excluded that the large-amplitude saccades likely
to be made in this condition of the psychophysics experiment contributed to the motion
percept and someway counteracted the effects of the increased rate of microsaccades in the
condition with the fixation symbol.

6 Conclusion
In summary, patterns, such as those used by Bridget Riley in her painting Fall provide a means
of creating the perception of motion in a static image. Retinal shifts caused by eye movements
made during visual fixation of the pattern, such as microsaccades and oculomotor drift,
might be responsible for this motion percept. Whereas clear effects could be found of the
presence of a fixation stimulus on the rate of the largest of these fixational eye movements,
microsaccades, the relationship with the perceived strength of motion was more ambiguous.
Two experiments suggested no relationship between microsaccade rates and the illusion,
whereas a third experiment suggested an inverse relation. Interestingly, on many of the
trials no microsaccades were detected, while the stimulus pattern still induced an illusion.
In consideration of earlier results, these findings call for an alternative explanation of the
motion illusion in Riley's Fall, possibly involving other types of fixational eye movements,
such as oculomotor drift, or transients from other sources, such as the onset and offset of
the stimuli. Future work should investigate these alternative explanations more closely--for
example, by inspecting oculomotor recordings for slow drift and by computer models to
further examine the underlying mechanisms of the perception of illusory motion.
