Abstract
Exposure to perchlorate is ubiquitous in the United States and has been found to be widespread in food and drinking water.
People living in the lower Colorado River region may have perchlorate exposure because of perchlorate in ground water
and locally-grown produce. Relatively high doses of perchlorate can inhibit iodine uptake and impair thyroid function, and
thus could impair neurological development in utero. We examined human exposures to perchlorate in the Imperial Valley
among individuals consuming locally grown produce and compared perchlorate exposure doses to state and federal
reference doses. We collected 24-hour urine specimen from a convenience sample of 31 individuals and measured urinary
excretion rates of perchlorate, thiocyanate, nitrate, and iodide. In addition, drinking water and local produce were also
sampled for perchlorate. All but two of the water samples tested negative for perchlorate. Perchlorate levels in 79 produce
samples ranged from non-detect to 1816 ppb. Estimated perchlorate doses ranged from 0.02 to 0.51 mg/kg of body weight/
day. Perchlorate dose increased with the number of servings of dairy products consumed and with estimated perchlorate
levels in produce consumed. The geometric mean perchlorate dose was 70% higher than for the NHANES reference
population. Our sample of 31 Imperial Valley residents had higher perchlorate dose levels compared with national reference
ranges. Although none of our exposure estimates exceeded the U. S. EPA reference dose, three participants exceeded the
acceptable daily dose as defined by bench mark dose methods used by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard
Assessment.

Introduction
Perchlorate occurs in the environment from both natural and
man-made sources. It is primarily synthesized for use as an oxidant
in solid rocket propellant. Perchlorate has been detected in food
and drinking water from various regions of the U.S. [1­3], and
human exposure to perchlorate is widespread in the U.S.
population [4]. At high doses (mg/kg of body weight/day),
perchlorate can affect the ability of the thyroid to absorb iodine
and can limit the production of thyroid hormones, which are
important for proper development in children [5]. Continued
inhibition of iodine uptake can lead to hypothyroidism, which can
result in metabolic problems in adults and abnormal development
during gestation and infancy. Low doses (mg/kg/day) of
perchlorate have been associated with decreased thyroxine and
increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in women with low
urinary iodine levels [6]. Even small changes in thyroid hormone
levels are cause for concern, as mild hypothyroidism during
pregnancy has been associated with subtle cognitive defects in
children [7­9]. Other compounds that inhibit iodine uptake are
thiocyanate (SCN) and nitrate (NO3
) [10]. These compounds are
also present in dietary and water sources, and SCN is a major
metabolite of cyanide found in cigarette smoke, so these
compounds are important to consider when examining perchlo-
rate's antithyroid effects [11].
Although perchlorate exposure is widespread in the U.S.
population, some locations may have higher exposure than others.
One such location is the Lower Colorado River region. In Nevada,
ammonium perchlorate manufacturing activities contaminated
ground and surface waters, and eventually, Lake Mead and the
Colorado River (Figure 1). The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and the State of Nevada are currently overseeing
cleanup operations for the area. The Colorado River is a primary
source of drinking water for 15 million­20 million people in
Arizona, Nevada, and California and also serves as the sole source
of irrigation water for California's Imperial Valley. Imperial
County has approximately 160,000 residents, and about 20% of
families are below the poverty level. Potentially elevated chemical

exposures in this low-income population may raise issues of
environmental equity.
The California Environmental Health Tracking Program
(CEHTP) conducts surveillance on environmental exposures and
environmentally-related chronic diseases. Due to concerns ex-
pressed about levels of perchlorate in produce grown in the lower
Colorado River region [12] and the lack of human exposure
studies [13], CEHTP partnered with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of
Public Health (CDPH) Food and Drug Laboratory Branch
(FDLB), the California Department of Toxic Substances Control
(DTSC), and 2 nongovernmental organizations (Commonweal
and Comite
´ Ci
´vico del Valle) to measure perchlorate exposure in
the Imperial Valley among persons consuming locally grown
produce.
Materials and Methods
We recruited a convenience sample of 31 residents living in
Imperial County, California, from attendees of a community
meeting related to local environmental concerns. Written
informed consent was obtained from each participant. Adult
residents who consumed local produce were eligible to participate.
We designed a short questionnaire to elicit information on
participants' demographic and personal characteristics (e.g.,
gender, age, weight, and height), smoking history, primary source
of drinking water, water filter use in the home, water consumption,
and source of produce. We also asked participants to complete a
24-hr dietary recall and a food diary to be completed for the 24-hr
study period. All materials were available in Spanish and English.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All
human subject protocols were approved by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's institutional review board. Participants
received their individual results from the laboratory tests of urine,
produce, and water and were also provided materials to help
interpret the results. Group findings were presented at a
participant meeting, and a local clinician was available for
consultation with participants for any health concerns related to
the study.
In addition, participants were asked to collect samples of all
drinking water and all local produce consumed during a 24-hr
period. Study staff provided standardized containers to partici-
pants for collection of all samples. Participants were instructed to
collect approximately 2 ounces of each produce sample in a plastic
bag. Produce samples were stored in participants' freezers until
collected by study staff. Participants were also instructed to collect
a 24-hr urine specimen, beginning after the last void of the day.
Urine was chilled in coolers or participants' refrigerators during
sample collection and transported in coolers by study staff. Total
urine volume was measured volumetrically and recorded for each
study participant. Urine sample aliquots (5 mL) were removed
from the vessels storing the 24-hr urine samples, transferred to

CryovialsH, and stored at 220uC at the Imperial County Public
Health Laboratory until shipped to CDC on dry ice. Produce
samples were shipped to the CDPH FDLB, and water samples
were analyzed by the DTSC.
Water samples were analyzed to detect perchlorate by using
EPA method 6850 (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry)
with a detection limit of 1 mg/L. Perchlorate was resolved by high-
performance liquid chromatography from the sample matrix,
ionized by using negative electrospray ionization, and partially
fragmented by mass spectrometry (MS). Perchlorate was further
fragmented into daughter ions upon collision with an inert gas and
detected by tandem MS using mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios 83
(-ClO3
), 85(-37ClO3
) and 89(-Cl18O3
) [14]. Quantitation and
identification of perchlorate were performed by comparing the
ratios of the primary perchlorate mass transitions to internal
standard mass transitions and by using retention times. Upon
positive detection, 2 samples were further analyzed to confirm
accuracy and precision. Samples were transferred to a clean
centrifuge tube and evaporated to dryness under a stream of
nitrogen at 70uC. The samples were then resuspended in 1.0 mL
of deionized water.
Produce was analyzed for perchlorate by using ion chromatog-
raphy-tandem MS [15]. The produce was chopped with a food
processor (Robot Coupe USA, Inc., Jackson, MS, USA) until the
matrix was homogeneous. A portion of chopped produce (10 g)
was transferred to a 50 mL polypropylene tube, and 100 mL of
3.0 mg/mL (300 ng) labeled internal standard was added. This
material was acidified by addition of 20 mL of 1% (vol/vol)
sodium hydroxide acetic acid, hand-shaken for 2 minutes and
centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes. Supernatant (5 mL) was
passed through a 500 mg­6 mL SupelcleanTM ENVI-CarbTM
cartridge (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) preconditioned
with 6 mL of water by applying vacuum such that the flow rate
was approximately 100 mL/second. This extract was filtered
through a 0.20 mm PTFE filter and analyzed by ion chromatog-
raphy-tandem MS using a Waters Quattro microTM API triple-
quad mass spectrometer operating in negative ion multiple
reaction monitoring mode. The m/z transition from 99 to 83
was primary for quantitating perchlorate, and the m/z transition
of 101 to 85 was confirmatory. 18O4
-labeled sodium perchlorate
(ICON Services, Inc., Summit, NJ, USA) served as internal
standard for monitoring the m/z transitions from 107 to 89 and
109 to 91 for quantitation and confirmation, respectively. The
limit of quantitation was 1 ng/g. All produce results were reported
using the wet weight of the edible portion of produce.
Perchlorate and related anions (thiocyanate, nitrate, and iodide)
were measured in urine by ion chromatography-tandem MS [16].
Analytes were quantified on the basis of the peak area ratio of mass
transitions for analyte to stable isotope-labeled internal standard.
Method detection limits were 0.05 mg/L, 0.50 mg/L, 10 mg/L,
and 500 mg/L, for perchlorate, iodide, thiocyanate, and nitrate,
respectively. Analytic accuracy and precision were tested by
concurrent analysis of quality control materials in the same
analysis batch as the unknown specimen. Reported results met the
accuracy and precision specifications of the quality control and
quality assurance program of the Division of Laboratory Sciences,
National Center for Environmental Health, CDC [16]. All
analytes were detected in all samples with the exception of 4
urine samples that did not contain measurable levels of nitrate;
nitrate levels in these two samples were assigned an imputed value
of half the detection limit for calculating the geometric mean of the
distribution.
Urinary creatinine concentrations were determined by using an
automated colorimetric method on a Roche/Hitachi Modular
Analytics SWA system (Roche Diagnostics Corp., IN, USA).
Creatinine excretion rate (g/24-hr) was calculated by multiplying
measured urinary creatinine concentration by the total volume of
24-hr urine collected. The calculated 24-hr creatinine excretion
rate was then compared with expected 24-hr creatinine excretion
rate based on the study participant age, sex, height, and weight
[17,18], according to a formula in which k = 1.93 for males and
1.64 for females:

We computed perchlorate dose in urine by multiplying the
perchlorate concentration by the 24-hr urine volume and dividing
the product by body weight (mg/kg/day). Total iodine intake was
estimated by multiplying urine iodide concentration by 24-hr
urine volume.
Final perchlorate doses were compared to the U.S. EPA
Reference Dose of 0.70 mg/kg/day [19]. We also compared
measured perchlorate doses with an ``acceptable daily dose''
computed based on the current methodology of the California
Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) (C.
Steinmaus, personal communication). In its Public Health Goal for
Perchlorate, the OEHHA computed the health-protective water
concentration for perchlorate [20] as follows:
Concentration~BMDL|RSC| BW=WC
ð Þ=UF
In this formula, BMDL = the lower limit of a one-sided 95% CI of
a perchlorate dose that reduces mean thyroidal iodine uptake by
5%; RSC = relative source contribution; BW/WC = the ratio of
body weight to tap water consumption rate; and UF = an
uncertainty factor of 10 to account for sensitive populations such
as pregnant women and infants. Using current OEHHA
methodology, we computed an acceptable daily dose (ADD) as
follows:
ADD~BMDL=UF~0:0037mg=kg=day=10~
0:00037 mg=kg=day~0:37mg=kg=day
Survey questionnaire data were double-entered into Excel
speadsheets (Excel version 2003, SP3, Microsoft, Redmond,
WA, USA) and then imported into SAS for analysis (SAS version
9.1.3., SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). We calculated
geometric means and CIs for perchlorate, nitrate, thiocyanate, and
total iodine intake. For each person, perchlorate concentration was
summed for all produce sampled. Total number of servings of
dairy products (i.e., milk, yogurt, and ice cream) was also summed
for each person. We used the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test to
compare levels of perchlorate dose by total dairy servings and
perchlorate concentration in produce [21]. The perchlorate dose
was log-normally distributed, so total servings of dairy and total
concentration of perchlorate in produce were regressed on the log-
normal perchlorate dose in linear regression models.

Participant Characteristics
The age of participants ranged from 18 to 88, with an average
of 41.1 years (Table 1). Among participants, 22.6% had no high
school education, 12.9% were high school graduates, and 12.9%
had at least a college degree. Almost all (97%) participants were

Hispanic, except for 1 non-Hispanic white. Eighty-one percent of
participants elected to have the interview conducted in Spanish.
Sixty-five percent of the participants were female, none of whom
reported being pregnant at the time of the interview. Seventy-five
percent of the women were of reproductive age (ages 15­49). Only
1 participant reported being a tobacco smoker. Two respondents
reported working in agriculture. When asked to identify the
primary source of drinking water in the home, 36% of participants
reported bottled water, 23% reported tap water, and the
remaining respondents reported various sources, such as well
water, delivery truck, and grocery store dispensers. Forty-five
percent of participants consumed ,25% of their water away from
home. Total dairy consumption averaged 1.05 servings per person
per day, with a range of 0­5 servings.
Water and Produce Perchlorate Results
Results of water confirmation analyses showed consistency
with original, primary sample results. Additionally, method
blanks, method standard recoveries, and sample duplicate
analyses' results were all within accepted control limits and
percentages. Only 2 of 68 water samples had detectable levels of
perchlorate (2.4 and 2.5 mg/L perchlorate), both of which were
less than half the California regulatory standard of 6 mg/L.
Perchlorate levels in the 79 produce samples ranged from
nondetectable to 1816 ppb (ng of perchlorate per g of net weight
of edible portion) (Table 2). The highest perchlorate levels were
detected in nopales (cactus) (maximum of 1398 ppb) and quelites
(Mexican greens) (2 samples tested, with levels of 1720 and
1816 ppb, respectively). Many produce categories, such as
lettuce, broccoli, grapefruit, tomatoes, watermelon, and corn,
had perchlorate levels #4 ppb. For 14 samples with perchlorate
levels falling below the detection limit, we used an imputed value
of half the detection limit. The mean perchlorate level of all
produce was 80.8 ppb. Most produce types had too few samples
per type to compute a representative average. Among those
persons who provided produce (n = 24), the mean perchlorate
level in their produce was 266 ppb per person. Produce
perchlorate levels were in the range of similar kinds of produce
tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in
nationally representative samples, except for celery and cucum-
bers, which were higher in our samples, and tomatoes and
watermelon, which were lower (Table 2).
Urine Results
The 24-hr creatinine output was normally distributed with a
mean of 1.33 g/day (SD = 0.494 g/day). The 24-hr creatinine
output was compared with the predicted 24-hr creatinine output
[17] to evaluate completeness of urine collection. The average
ratio of measured-to-predicted 24-hr creatinine was 1.03,
indicating good compliance of the study participants for collecting
all urine within the defined 24-hr study period.
Perchlorate concentrations in urine ranged from1.08 mg/L to
32.2 mg/L, with a geometric mean of 6.44 mg/L (Table 3). The
24-hr perchlorate dose in urine ranged from 0.02 to 0.51 mg/kg of
body weight/day. The geometric mean perchlorate dose for study
participants was 0.11 mg/kg/day (95% CI, 0.08­0.15). Perchlorate
concentrations and doses were higher in the Imperial Valley study
participants compared to reference values from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
The geometric means for urine levels of thiocyanate and nitrate
were 816 and 21,800 mg/g creatinine, respectively, compared to
geometric means for the general U. S. population of 1500 and
44,500 mg/g creatinine based on data from NHANES 2001­2002
(Blount, unpublished data). The geometric mean for daily iodine
intake was 158 mg/day, which is slightly higher than the
Recommended Daily Intake (RDI, 150 mg/day) established by
the U.S. FDA . Eighteen participants, including 10 of the 15
women of reproductive age, had daily iodine intakes below
150 mg/day.
When stratifying perchlorate dose by total dairy servings,
geometric means of perchlorate dose increased with increasing
dairy consumption (Figure 2) (nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis
test, p = 0.24). In a linear regression model on log perchlorate
dose, each serving of dairy products was associated with a
24% increase in urine perchlorate levels (p = 0.04; r2 = 0.14).
Perchlorate dose in urine showed a similar increase with
categories of perchlorate concentration (using natural breaks
in perchlorate distribution) in consumed produce (Figure 3)
(nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.03). Each 10 ppb of
perchlorate in produce was associated with a 1% increase in log
perchlorate dose (p = 0.09; r2 = 0.13).

Discussion
In this study of perchlorate exposure among Imperial County
residents, we found perchlorate exposure doses that were, on
average, 70% higher than the NHANES U.S. reference
population (Table 3). Although all study participants had
measurable perchlorate levels in their urine, none of the exposure
doses exceeded the U.S. EPA reference dose of 0.70 mg/kg/day.
We also compared perchlorate exposure estimates with the
acceptable daily dose (0.37 mg/kg/day) derived by using current
methodology of the California Office of Environmental Health
Hazard Assessment. Three study participants had perchlorate
exposure dose estimates in excess of this acceptable daily dose. The
health implications of this perchlorate exposure are unknown.
The developing fetus is thought to be a particularly sensitive life
stage for perchlorate exposure [5]. Measurement of perchlorate in
amniotic fluid confirms that perchlorate can cross the placenta
[22]. Therefore, we further examined perchlorate exposure in the
48% of our study population who were women of reproductive
age. We found that 1 of these women exceeded the acceptable
daily dose calculated by using OEHHA methodology. Among the
15 women of reproductive age in our study, 10 (75%) had low
iodine intake (below the RDI). Continued perchlorate exposure
above the OEHHA threshold among these women could increase
their risk of subclinical hypothyroidism, which has been linked to
subtle cognitive defects in children. To what degree perchlorate
exposure contributes to the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroid-
ism (2%­3%) in women of reproductive age is unknown [23].
Perchlorate exposure is of health concern because perchlorate
inhibits uptake of iodine, which is essential for thyroid function.

Thiocyanate (elevated after exposure to cyanide in tobacco smoke,
for example) and nitrate may interact with perchlorate in an
additive fashion that also inhibits iodine uptake [10]. The levels of
thiocyanate and nitrate found in this study were comparable to or
lower than levels found previously in other populations [4]. We
also evaluated urinary levels of iodine in this population. The
geometric mean for iodine was found to be 158 mg/day, indicating
a generally adequate intake of iodine. If a person's estimated
iodine intake was less than the recommended daily intake of
150 mg/day, then he or she was advised to increase iodine intake
through diet or by taking iodine-containing supplements. Addi-
tionally, for study participants who chose to add salt to their food,
we mentioned iodized salt in small amounts as an effective iodine
source.
We did not find that the drinking water samples collected in the
24-hr study period had significant levels of perchlorate. Only 2
samples had detectable levels (.1 mg/L detection limit), and both
were below the Maximum Contaminant Limit (6 mg/L) for
California. Conversely, we found several samples of produce
consumed by participants to have high levels of perchlorate,
notably nopales (opuntia cactus) and quelites, with levels exceeding
1700 ppb. These results are consistent with other published
measurements of relatively high levels of perchlorate in opuntia
cactus [24]. Perchlorate levels in some produce tested, such as
cantaloupe, grapefruit, pepper, broccoli, and lemon, are in the
same range as levels that have been reported previously [1,27],
and others, including watermelon and tomato, had lower levels
than previously detected. We found moderate perchlorate
contamination in cucumbers (439.8 ppb), similar to previously
published results [25].
Consistent with the scientific literature, we found that
perchlorate dose was related to intake of dairy products and
produce. Dairy products, fruits and vegetables have been
characterized by other scientists as contributing significantly to
perchlorate intakes [26,27]. In our study we found that each
10 ppb of perchlorate measured in produce was related to a
marginally-significant 1% increase in estimated perchlorate dose
(p = 0.09). Similarly we found that each serving of milk/dairy
products, based on questionnaire data, was associated with a 24%
increase in estimated perchlorate dose (p = 0.04). While our
regression modeling indicates that dairy consumption and produce
perchlorate levels are directly related to estimated perchlorate
dose, these models only explained a relatively small amount of the
total variance in estimated perchlorate dose in the study
population (13­14%). The most plausible explanation of the low
relatively R2 of our regression models is that we could not include
a variable for the total intake amount of perchlorate from produce
(no serving size data) and milk/dairy products (no measurement of
perchlorate levels of serving size). Furthermore, the physiological
half life of perchlorate in the human body (,8 hrs) would lead to
imperfect overlap between questionnaire data and perchlorate
excreted into the 24-hr urine, and consumption of other food items
besides local produce during the study period would introduce
further variability.
This study had several strengths and limitations. To our
knowledge, this is the first effort to directly measure perchlorate
exposure biomarkers in this population with potentially elevated
exposure. In addition to perchlorate, we also measured toxicolog-
ically-related anions thiocyanate, nitrate, and iodide in each study
participant's urine. Our exposure assessment was further strength-

ened by measuring these anions in a 24-hr urine sample so that the
data was less variable than spot urine measurements. Furthermore,
this biomonitoring data was paired with simultaneously collected
produce and drinking water samples to assist in identifying
potential exposure sources. However, we were able to only assess
dairy consumption through interview and were unable to directly
measure perchlorate levels in dairy samples. Instead, we reference
previously published perchlorate levels in dairy milk in this region
[12].
Our perchlorate dose estimate method assumed that exactly
24 hrs worth of urine was collected. Comparison of measured 24-
hr creatinine with predicted 24-hr creatinine indicates that, on
average, the predicted and measured creatinine excretion agree
remarkably well (average ratio = 1.03). However, 1 woman
excreted only 54% of the creatinine expected for her age and
body weight, perhaps due to differences in lean body mass or to
incomplete collection of the urine samples within the 24-hr period.
Thus, our exposure estimates for this 1 study participant may be
biased towards being lower than actual exposure levels.
Additional limitations include the small convenience sample of
study participants which prevent us from generalizing these results
to Imperial County residents and the single sampling day, which
did not enable us to study variability of exposure across days and
seasons. Additionally, we did not examine any health or thyroid
endpoints.
In conclusion, we found that our sample of 31 Imperial Valley
residents had higher perchlorate dose levels compared with
national reference ranges. Additionally, 3 participants exceeded
the acceptable daily dose calculated by using methods of the
California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.
Several produce samples collected had high perchlorate levels,
exceeding 1700 ppb. Continued biomonitoring of perchlorate
exposure in this population could help evaluate whether reducing
perchlorate contamination of the Colorado River over time leads
to reduced human exposure.
