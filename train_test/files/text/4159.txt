Introduction
Adolescence is thought to be a risk period for the develop-
ment of mental health concerns (e.g., Vyas, Birchwood, &
Singh, 2015) with older adolescence/early adulthood seeing
a significant increase in symptomology (Murphy & Fonagy,
2012; Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2012). This occurs
alongside reduced mental health service use. A large propor-
tion of service "dropouts" occur around 16 to 18 years old
(Singh, Paul, Ford, Kramer, & Weaver, 2008). Traditionally,
child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) pro-
vide interventions for young people up to 18 years. To ensure
appropriate service provision, policy suggests CAMHS are
responsive to client's developmental stage (Department for
Children, Schools and Families [DCSF] & Department of
Health [DoH], 2008) and individual need (DoH, 2015).
Engagement in services may be an important part of effec-
tive mental health treatment (YoungMinds, 2014). Elements
hypothesized to be part of engagement (e.g., King, Currie, &
Petersen, 2014), such as the therapeutic relationship (Shirk &
Karver, 2003), may be linked to treatment outcome. For older
adolescents, service engagement could be a challenge (Royal
College of Psychiatrists, 2012).Alongside experiencing mental
distress, they may also be faced with societal (e.g., stigma;
Eisenberg, Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin, 2009), familial
(YoungMinds, 2006), and developmental (Erikson, 1968) pres-
sures. In addition, 16 to 18 years is a potential time of transition
between CAMHS and adult mental health services (AMHS),
which may impose its own challenges (National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence [NICE], 2016; Singh, Evans,
Sireling, & Stuart, 2005; Singh et al., 2008).
Despite this, little is known theoretically and specifically
about 16- to 18-year-old engagement. Definitions have been
proposed for children, families, and the whole adolescent age
range(e.g.,Cunningham,Duffee,Huang,Steinke,&Naccarato,

Experiences of Engaging With Mental
Health Services in 16- to 18-Year-Olds: An
Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
Siobhan Jones1, Alex Hassett1, and Irene Sclare2
Abstract
Despite older adolescence being a risk period for the development of mental health concerns, mental health service
engagement is low among 16- to 18-year-olds. As therapeutic attendance is linked to clinical outcome, it is important
to understand engagement in this population. There is a paucity of research looking specifically at the older adolescent
engagement phenomenon. Previous qualitative research into adolescent experiences has provided rich and detailed results.
Interpretative phenomenological analysis was chosen as the methodological approach. Ten 16- to 18-year-olds were recruited
from two London-based child and adolescent mental health services. Each young person was interviewed to understand
his or her personal experience of engaging in mental health services, and associated engagement barriers and facilitators.
Interviews were transcribed and underwent analysis. Analysis revealed ten subthemes subsumed within four superordinate
themes: engagement begins at help seeking, strength of inner resolve, evolution of the self and in the clinic room. Themes
are discussed in detail. Conclusions are drawn in relation to previous theory and research. When considering 16- to 18-year
understandings of the engagement phenomena, key elements include clinician and service developmental appropriateness,
negotiation of developmental tasks in relation to engagement, experience of the physical building environment, and
awareness of service policy. Suggestions for clinical practice in relation to engagement facilitators and threat are made, and
recommendations for future research proposed.

2 SAGE Open
2009; Staudt, 2007), which go beyond the definition of "merely
turning up" (Gopalan et al., 2010) or "dropping out" (Johnson,
Mellor, & Brann, 2008). More comprehensive definitions
incorporate multiple elements such as behavioral (e.g., atten-
dance) and attitudinal (e.g., emotional investment in treatment)
components (Staudt, 2007), as well as considering the facilitat-
ing role of the therapeutic relationship (see King et al., 2014,
below). However, definitions lack consensus (Kim, Munson, &
McKay, 2012), and are not specific to the older adolescence.
Help-seeking definitions also incorporate elements of engage-
ment, such as seeking professional help (e.g., Rickwood,
Deane, Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005), meaning the overlap
between the two is apparent but undefined. Theoretical prog-
ress may be hindered because of unclear definition (Drieschner,
Lammers, & van der Staak, 2004).
Models applicable to adolescent engagement are limited
but some have been developed. King et al. (2014) proposed a
child and adolescent motivational model. This focuses on
ongoing engagement within treatment, from a therapeutic
relational perspective, considering hope and confidence to be
key. Both client and therapist bring emotional, behavioral,
and cognitive elements to engagement, suggesting responsi-
bility for engagement is not solely with one party. This model
is not specific to older adolescents, and the fluctuating nature
of engagement (Donnellan, Murray, & Harrison, 2012) is not
accounted for.
Broome, Joe, and Simpson (2001) developed a model for
young people who experience substance misuse. Multifaceted
elements of engagement are incorporated such as "background
factors" (e.g., family), treatment readiness, and session attri-
butes (e.g., therapeutic involvement). The generalizability of
this model outside of a substance-misuse population may be
limited. Barriers to treatment, for children, adolescents, and
their families, have also been considered. The ecological point
of view model (McKay, Gonzales, Stone, Ryland, & Kohner,
1995), coming from a family therapy perspective, suggests
that barriers can exist at multiple levels (e.g., individual, com-
munity), acknowledging the role of the "ecosystem" in
engagement. The Barriers to Treatment Model (Kazdin,
Holland, & Crowley, 1997) proposes difficult familial rela-
tions with therapists may contribute to treatment termination.
These models highlight the role of families in engagement;
however, they do not focus on the unique experiences of 16- to
18-year-olds, where families, communities, and so forth may
be positioned differently. Research suggests adolescents may
prefer peer support (e.g., Raviv, Raviv, Vago-Gefen, & Fink,
2009). Indeed, peers and perceived impact on self-esteem
(e.g., threats to self-esteem model; Fisher, Nadler, & Whitcher-
Alagna, 1982) may influence engagement.
The above models were developed through a process of
scoping review, interview through predetermined outcome
measures, or interview with parents (see Broome et al., 2001;
Kazdin et al., 1997; King et al., 2014; McKay et al., 1995). It
appears consultation with adolescents was absent. These con-
ceptualizations are markedly adult centric in understanding,
and, therefore, lack an adolescent-specific phenomenological
focus. Attempting to understand young people through adap-
tations of developmentally inappropriate models may hinder
theoretical progress (Weisz & Hawley, 2002).
Empirical research related to the adolescent engagement
phenomenon has been extensive. However, this tends to
focus on individual elements related to engagement, such as
beliefs and expectations (e.g., Rickwood, Deane, & Wilson,
2007; Ronzoni & Dogra, 2012; Watsford, Rickwood, &
Vanags, 2013), satisfaction (McCann & Lubman, 2012),
interventions (see Kim et al., 2012, for review), disengage-
ment (e.g., Schimmelmann, Conus, Schacht, McGorry, &
Lambert, 2006), or role of family (see Gopalan et al., 2010,
for review), rather than engagement in its entirety from the
adolescent perspective. The closed, measure-led, and adult-
centric nature of these studies may have limited exploration
of the engagement phenomena beyond that prescribed by
the selected questionnaires and the research investigators.
Investigating older adolescent understandings of engage-
ment as a whole, including the barriers and facilitators sug-
gested above, from the young person's perspective
(YoungMinds, 2005), may allow for a deeper exploration,
and understanding.
Some related research has adopted a more adolescent-led
approach. These studies tend to use a qualitative methodol-
ogy and have generated interesting and rich results. Harper,
Dickson, and Bramwell (2014) investigated young people's
experiences of a 16- to 18-year-old mental health service as
a whole. Themes emerged around young people valuing ther-
apeutic relationships and the service meeting developmental
needs. Adolescent understandings of engagement experi-
ences were not explicitly discussed. Bury, Raval, and Lyon's
(2007) interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA)
investigation looked at adolescent experiences throughout a
course of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Engagement
themes were evident but not explored in depth. The article
suggested paying attention to client views of psychotherapy,
and issues around control and power might help improve ini-
tial engagement. This study focused on one therapeutic
modality and did not take into account wider issues such as
service provision, which may also affect engagement
(Munford & Sanders, 2016).
Using IPA as part of a mixed-methods investigation,
Kapur et al. (2014) looked directly into service engagement
among two young people who experienced voice hearing,
and their parents. Superordinate themes included battling
with mental health services and frustration with received
care. However, one participant was 11 years old, and parent's
experiences were included, meaning the study was not
wholly older adolescent specific. In addition, the focus was
limited to one specific mental health presentation. As illus-
trated, the use of qualitative methods may facilitate in-depth
and rich investigations to occur (Smith, Flowers, & Larkin,
2009), including when recruiting adolescent participants
(O'Reilly & Parker, 2014).
Jones et al. 3
To date, in-depth exploration of 16- to 18-year-old under-
standings of their service engagement experiences, facilita-
tors, and barriers, has not been conducted. Research into
older adolescent-specific understandings will contribute to a
lacking evidence base. To ensure services are responsive to
the population they serve, it is essential to understand the
unique needs and views of the targeted client group.
Investigation could contribute to the effective development
of older adolescent tailored services, which may positively
affect therapeutic outcomes. By engaging young people
effectively in services, we may be able to prevent more seri-
ous and enduring problems later on in life (Birchwood &
Singh, 2013).
Research Aims and Questions
The need for further investigation is highlighted by three
coexisting issues: the rise in mental health concerns in older
adolescence, the high service drop rate at this age, and the
paucity of research into 16- to 18-year-old engagement. The
current study aimed to explore older adolescent sense making
of their engagement experiences, barriers, and facilitators, to
contribute to a sparse understanding. Research questions
were as follows:
Research Question 1: What is the 16- to 18-year-olds
understanding of their experience of engaging in mental
health services?
Research Question 2: What is their understanding of
their experience of engagement facilitators and engage-
ment barriers?
Method
Research Design and Methodology
To aid in-depth exploration of the 16- to 18-year-old engage-
ment phenomena, a nonexperimental, descriptive design was
chosen. Due to the paucity and "adult-led" nature of previous
research, and taking example from prior study designs that
generated rich data, a qualitative methodology was used.
IPA (Smith, 1996) was chosen as the methodological
approach. Informed by philosophical understandings of phe-
nomenology, hermeneutics, and ideography (Smith et al.,
2009), IPA enables insight to be developed into specific sub-
jective meanings and interpretations people make of an expe-
rienced phenomena. This meant in-depth understanding of
the 16- to 18-year-olds idiosyncratic sense making of their
engagement experience could be generated.
Participants
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed to facili-
tate recruitment of a homogeneous sample (Hefferon &
Gil-Rodriquez, 2011) while ensuring an understanding of
engagement could be ascertained across adolescent expe-
riences. The reason for focusing on the 16- to 18-year-old
stage is that this is the period, when societally, adolescents
begin to be defined as "adult" and, alongside this, separa-
tion from caregivers is an increasingly prominent issue. It
is, therefore, important to understand how this relates to
engagement with services, especially as previous models
of help seeking/engagement (also mentioned in the
"Introduction" section) have highlighted the importance
of caregivers in accessing help. Research has also sug-
gested that there is a shift developmentally, across adoles-
cence, when it comes to help seeking/engagement
(Rickwood, Mazzer, & Telford, 2015).
Inclusion criteria were as follows:
·
· between 16 and 18 years old and
·
· engaged with mental health services at interview.
Engagement was defined as having been offered, and
was attending appointments (e.g. McKay & Bannon,
2004), for any length of time.
Exclusion criteria were as follows:
·
· active psychosis,
·
· significant developmental delay, and
·
· significant risk issues
Ten participants (Table 1) were recruited from two CAMHS
services in London. All adolescents approached were inter-
viewed and none ceased participation in the study. A small
number of participants allowed for in-depth, rich data gather-
ing and analysis. The sample size was in line with recom-
mendations (Smith et al., 2009) and commensurate with
previous IPA research (e.g., Colton & Pistrang, 2004; Huws
& Jones, 2008; Roose & John, 2003).
Ethical approval. Ethical approval was requested and granted
by an NHS Research Ethics Committee. Research and devel-
opment, and CAMHS research approval, was granted by the
recruiting NHS Trust. The British Psychological Society
(BPS; 2013) code of human research ethics was followed.
Risk precautions.All interviews took place during clinic
hours and the researcher familiarized themselves with ser-
vice risk protocol. Participant's clinicians were made aware
of interview timings. Due to the potentially sensitive nature
of the interview content, participants were informed of avail-
able support if they became distressed after leaving the ser-
vice building.
Recruitment. Recruitment took place over 6 months. The
researcher advertised the study in team meetings. Partici-
pants who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were identified by
their clinician, and invited to take part at their next therapy
session. If the adolescent showed interest, they were asked
4 SAGE Open
by their clinician to provide verbal consent for their contact
details to be passed on to the researcher. Initial contact was
made by telephone. Participants were invited to attend an
introductory session (after a therapy session for participant
ease) to read through the participant information sheet (PIS)
and ensure they understood enough about the study to make
an informed decision to participate. This was ascertained
by asking them to repeat back what they understood about
the study and their participation. If this was demonstrated,
participants were invited back for a second meeting to sign
the consent form and be interviewed. All participants dem-
onstrated understanding and were invited back. A £10 high
street voucher was given for participation.
Interviews.Data collection was via 1:1 semistructured
interview. This provided a tentative framework but allowed
for open conversation about the engagement phenomena,
encouraging the participant to set the parameters of the
discussion. The interview questions revolved around the
following key areas: the young person's experience of
coming to the service; what they felt helped them to keep
coming back and what would make them not want to attend
the service. To ensure adolescent understanding of the
schedule, PIS, and consent form, a group of five 16- to
18-year-olds, from a local school, were consulted. Two
CAMHS-based clinical psychologists reviewed the final
schedule to ensure relevance to the research questions. At
the beginning of each interview, participants were reminded
their participation was voluntary and were free to leave at
any time. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed for
analysis, and anonymized. Interviews lasted between 30
and 65 min.

Analysis
Transcripts were analyzed following IPA protocol (Smith
et al., 2009). To become familiar with the data, transcripts
were read while listening to the audio recording. This allowed
for linguistic or verbal nuances to be ascertained. Transcripts
were then reread to ensure full immersion in the data, gather-
ing an overall understanding of how different sections were
connected and emerged.
Alongside the data, detailed notes were made on descrip-
tive, conceptual, and linguistic understandings and explora-
tions.Thehermeneuticcyclewasexperiencedasinterpretations
were made on participant understandings of their engagement
experience, while remaining close to the original meaning.
The initial noting was read through closely and themes
developed. These emerged by focusing on discrete chunks of
data, while keeping in mind the interview as a whole. The
developed emergent themes attempted to reflect the com-
plexity of the data while drawing out key ideas.
Emergent themes were typed into a word document, in
chronological order. Through a process of abstraction, themes
were moved around the page, drawing together related items.
Emerging patterns were developed into superordinate themes.
The iterative nature of analysis was experienced, returning to
the original transcript to ensure superordinate themes reflected
the original data.
To move onto the next transcript, ideas from the previous
interview were bracketed by noting assumptions and ideas
developed from the analysis. This process was repeated for
all transcripts.
All emergent and superordinate themes were printed, cut
out, and laid on a large surface. Themes were moved around,
using the abstraction process, until patterns and commonali-
ties emerged. The hermeneutic and double-hermeneutic
cycle was experienced as higher order concepts were devel-
oped and variance among individuals noted. Concepts were
typed out and quotes collected from the transcripts. Following
recommendations (Smith et al., 2009), the recurrence of the
higher order concepts was considered in table form. Themes
that did not occur in 50% of participants, or above, were
removed. Remaining overarching, and embedded themes,
were retained. Smith et al. (2009) state the analytic process
may continue into the writing of results. Themes were recon-
sidered and revised as writing continued.
Quality Assurance
To ensure quality and validity, Mays and Pope's (2000) crite-
ria was followed. To assess analytic reliability, investigator
triangulation took place. Four transcripts were analyzed and
coded separately by two research supervisors. These were
checked against the original coding by the main researcher.
There was no full disagreement on emergent themes. Minor
discrepancies around theme meanings were discussed to
ensure intercoder reliability (Yardley, 2000).
The role of prior assumptions and personal characteristics
were reflected upon and discussed with a research supervi-
sor. The impact of age difference was considered. It was
observed that some participants mentioned difficulties with
opening up to adults, fearing judgment. In addition, the
researcher had prior assumptions, from personal and profes-
sional experience, that adolescents may have been reluctant
to engage with the interview process. By participating in the
interview, the adolescent was experiencing a separate
engagement process with the researcher. It was wondered
how this may have affected the participant, and researcher's
responses, especially in the earlier stages of the interview.
As interviews progressed, positioning and power dynam-
ics between researcher and adolescent were noted. Reflexive
conversations focused on how participants may have
expressed, or altered, their opinions about clinicians or ser-
vices. They may have assumed the researcher would feed-
back to his or her clinician, or alter his or her perception of
the participant (despite being informed of the confidentiality
process), giving more socially desirable responses.
Before recruitment began, a bracketing interview was
conducted with a trainee clinical psychologist about personal
or professional assumptions and experiences. This bracket-
ing interview, discussion with supervisors, and keeping a
research diary were used to reflect on and work with these
assumptions. Following each interview and transcript analy-
sis, notes were made, to allow for biases or assumptions to be
discussed or thought through. The limitations of this process
were noted (e.g., Heidegger, 1927/2010), around how possi-
ble it can be to "truly" bracket off assumptions.
Attention was paid to cases, or sections of transcripts,
which "deviated" from emerging themes, by disconfirming
or contradicting analysis. This aided a process of broadening
and refining themes.
Results
Analysis resulted in four superordinate themes, which sub-
sumed 10 subthemes (Table 2). Superordinate themes were
engagement begins at help seeking, strength of inner resolve,
evolution of the self, and in the clinic room.
Theme 1. Engagement Begins at Help Seeking
This superordinate theme conceptualizes engagement as
beginning at help seeking. All 10 participants discussed their
help-seeking journey to aid sense making of their engage-
ment experiences. The boundary between the two may be
overlapping for adolescents.
Reliance on adult acknowledgment of distress and facilitation of
professional help seeking. All participants spoke about the role
adults played in acknowledging their distress and facilitating
professional help seeking, marking the start of their engage-
ment journey. Hannah ". . . explained to my mum what was

Max's distress was acknowledged by a teacher: "she noticed
I wasn't participating as much and I was looking down . . .
we had a chat in her office and she said she'd put me on the
waiting list for a counsellor." [Max]
It appears reliance on adult acknowledgment may have
been important for participants in times of crisis due to
uncertainty about whether their distress warranted, or how to
seek, professional help. For some participants, there may
have been a dilemma between negotiating independence and
adult reliance, reflecting a challenging pull between adoles-
cent-as-a-child and adolescent-as-an-adult within the initial
engagement stage:
I think there's a part of every teenager really when your mum
says something like "oh you need help" that's like . . . just don't!
(laughs), erm, I think part of it was also that I was kind of
worried . . . so the fact that she said it, I think it was necessary
really . . . [Jenny]
Cognitive preparedness.A theme emerged around the role of
participant's "cognitive preparedness," personal beliefs
around their need for professional help (see Table 2), and
their understanding of what could be gained from this. For
example, Nebi understood, ". . . to make myself feel better I
had to start coming . . ."
Understanding previous coping strategies were no longer
beneficial played a role, for some, in developing cognitive
preparedness. Jenny "came to the realisation that . . . the
default thing I always fell into wasn't working." Hannah felt
her usual "bottle it all up" strategy had become "counterpro-
ductive as you just build up all the negativeness and it all
comes out crazy (laughs)."
Jones et al. 7
Cognitive preparedness may potentially set the stage for
adult acknowledgment and facilitation of further help seek-
ing. Rose illustrates,
Researcher: What was it like for you? [Mum] saying, I
think you need to get help now?
Rose: It wasn't that surprising, because I did.
Participants may have been reliant on an alignment
between adult suggestion and their own cognitive prepared-
ness.As seen from Jenny above, this alignment however, may
be experienced as a challenging negotiation between personal
cognitive acknowledgment and "the part of every teenager"
that desires independence.
Theme 2: Strength of Inner Resolve
This superordinate theme relates to participants' inner deter-
mination to "get better" [Nebi]. There was evidence this acted
as a key engagement motivator, as each participant made ref-
erence, throughout the process of their sense making, to the
impact their personal resolve had on their experience.
Striving against engagement threats.A sense of striving to
maintain engagement in the face of "threats" came through
strongly from the data. All participants identified threats they
had experienced throughout the engagement process. These
included mental health symptomology, engagement practi-
calities, and disappointments with the service.
Some participants spoke about contending with the very
symptomology they were seeking help for. Despite feeling
anxious, Caroline attended "because I wanted the help" and
Anna "psyched [herself] up and thought this is going to be a
good thing so don't get scared otherwise you won't end up
coming." Noah maintained engagement, despite having dif-
ficult "draining" sessions as "I'd like to be more functional
and mentally healthy than I am . . ." Max explained how his
depression affected his engagement experience:
. . . there are times as I said when I don't want to get better,
because I'm feeling so crap, erm . . . but then there are times
when I know I need to get better because this is not me, I won't
do myself justice in a way, and so coming here I guess is helping
with that.
Regarding practicalities, Nebi explained she was, "deter-
mined to get help" despite finding it difficult to remember
appointment times. Rose felt her initial therapist was not
helping her in the way she needed, so requested to see a dif-
ferent clinician, despite feeling uncomfortable:
Researcher: What happened when you were thinking
about how to resolve this issue?
Rose: I was nervous but I felt like if I saw someone else
then it would be a lot better.
Jenny spoke about feeling disappointed with the care she
received. When prompted to discuss what maintained her
engagement despite these experiences, she explained,
I have to just take whatever I can from what is being offered . . .
because otherwise I just, there's no, I can't just sit and not do
anything, if I want to get better I'm going to have to do something
about it so like I just I'm taking whatever I can from what there is.
What was striking from these data was the strength of par-
ticipant's inner striving against experiences identified as dif-
ficult, and their resolve to weather storms-of-engagement.
Despite there being bias in the fact all participants were
actively engaged at time of interview, few had experienced a
smooth journey to be where they were. It appeared they
strived to maintain their engagement through an inner sense
of purpose to receive, and maintain receiving help, for their
distress.
Responsibility to others.Maintaining engagement through a
sense of "responsibility to others" emerged. This responsibility
was mainly in relation to parents. Noah felt "bad about letting
people down" when he had not attended appointments in the
past, and Max initially attended, in part because, "mum and dad
were, I couldn't, you know, they urged me to go." When Anna
thought further about her reasons for engaging she realized,
"part of it was for me and part of it was for my mum . . ."
Data suggested that participants responded to an aware-
ness of the impact their behavior had on those around them,
considering more people than just themselves were invested
in their engagement journey. There appeared to be complex-
ity around how reliance on parents/adults to aid engagement
sat alongside the responsibility participants may have felt for
them. It appeared once this noticing occurred, and profes-
sional help facilitated, participants may have then felt
responsible to manage their engagement, for themselves, and
for those around them.
Theme 3: Evolution of the Self
This superordinate theme relates to participant accounts of
their journey through their engagement process and the sense
of themselves "evolving" as this progressed.
Progression through suspense and release.Nine participants
spoke about their experience of anticipation before initial
attendance and the subsequent relief. What was marked within
this presession build-up were the expectations participants
had, mainly around anticipating the service/clinician to be
"stern" [Nebi] or "not friendly" [Chris]. They also described
the "anxious" [Rose] or "nervous" [Max] feelings accompa-
nying this. Hannah explains,
It was nerve-wracking to come . . . and already I was really
nervous when I was in the like, erm, in the reception.
8 SAGE Open
She went on to consider the thoughts behind this:
I thought it was going to be a really officey looking woman who
was going to talk down to me.
The time between referral and session attendance has an
element of being a no-mans-land of suspense between help
seeking and engagement, which was managed by some par-
ticipants by either putting it "out of my mind" [Max] or "kind
of losing hope" [Caroline]. Despite nervousness, two partici-
pants also spoke about "looking forward to" [Jenny] attend-
ing as they felt "excited" [Anna] about receiving help. This
contributes to an idea of suspense before attendance rather
than anxiety. Participants spoke about how this initial "build-
up" was followed by release, describing the "relief"
[Caroline, Chris, Max] felt as they began their first session.
To continue following Hannah's journey, here she illustrates
this release:
. . . I'm finally talking about it and having to face things rather
than bottling it up, so fizzing coke bottle, and then letting it go
and letting it out . . .
The commonly expressed anticipation around "formality"
from the service/clinicians is interesting when considering
16- to 18-year-old engagement. This sheds light on older
adolescent's relationships to, and expectations of adults, and
hints toward the complexity of this population's engagement
experience, for example, negotiating whether they are relat-
ing to adults/clinicians as independent adults themselves, or
as children. This is illustrated by Caroline, discussing inde-
pendence from adults, while seeing them as authority, during
initial engagement suspense and release:
. . . like, I feel like in general when you're young you kind of feel
like "oh I'm independent, I don't need adults" . . . I feel like, if
you, when you speak to an adult it just feels like they're authority
and they're going to tell you off kind of thing so it's nice when
someone is friendly with you and not talking down on you . . .
Growth through familiarity and trust affect. This subtheme relates
to participant's growth as they became familiar with the
engagement process. This sense of familiarity and trust
appeared to be described by some participants as something
felt. Chris explained how he ". . . felt support" from the service.
In addition, this ". . . buil[t] up slowly, like a process . . ." [Caro-
line], and felt like, ". . . a natural thing . . ." [Jenny], which made
it "easier to go" [Nicole]. Through this, Max explained he
"started to admit more and more." This contributes to a sense of
"growth," for example, in confidence, through the process,
which encouraged participants to continue attending. For Caro-
line, "it just encouraged me to do it more and more."
Trust in the engagement process appeared to develop as
therapeutic gains emerged, contributing further to the idea of
growth. Two participants illustrate:
. . . I've changed my attitude quite a lot . . . I feel like that's why
I kept on coming back a lot as well 'cos I felt like I could manage
things a lot more . . . [Hannah]
. . . then I realized that I'm actually getting a bit better and that
every time I went and then was on my own in like normal life, I
just felt a little bit better. [Nicole]
This feeling of growth appeared to play an important role
in the engagement experience, "feeling" like progressions
were being made. Being able to tangibly see "the change"
[Caroline] and "feel like I'm getting help" [Rose] was of key
importance.
Negotiating as an adolescent through choice, transparency, and
control.This subtheme is concerned with the negotiation,
from the unique older adolescent perspective, of choice,
transparency, and control, and the contradictions that come
with this around autonomy and reliance on adult direction.
This can be seen in negotiating the balance between par-
ticipants feeling clinicians were ". . . trying to make me do
something . . ." [Max] versus, "suggestions." For Nicole, the
subtleties between this could be seen across the interview.
She spoke about how clinicians "telling" her what do acted
as an engagement de-motivator, however, later spoke about
how "suggesting things to help" aided engagement. Nebi dis-
cussed how she doesn't "really like being told what to do so
I would probably wouldn't have done it" but later replied,
Researcher: . . . how helpful do you think it was then not
being given a choice of what you had and just being
told, this is what you're going to do . . . ?
Nebi: Good because I think my other therapist kind of
knew me better that I knew myself . . .
Choice was also linked to perceptions of "transparency"
about the thinking behind the therapeutic process, which in
turn aided the participant's sense of control over this--some-
thing that appeared important. For Rose and Max, being
made aware of the usual procedure to have parents involved
in early sessions gave them the opportunity to request for this
not to happen. This control allowed Max to experience ". . .
less stress . . . less issues." For Noah, who was making the
transition from CAMHS to AMHS, through discussions with
clinicians, was clear about the process this involved, sug-
gesting this "help[s] me adjust." Jenny, with decisions about
location of care, felt once she was made aware of the process
behind this "was fine with it 'cos we talked about it so I
wasn't completely like shut out of decisions."
Theme 4: In the Clinic Room
This superordinate theme is concerned with participants
making sense of their experiences, of both therapist and ther-
apy, within sessions.
Jones et al. 9
Developmentally appropriate responsiveness. This subtheme is
around how participants made sense of their engagement
experiences in relation to (lack of) clinician responsiveness
to their developmental stage. Participants consistently
touched on themes about the perception of (not) being spo-
ken to in a "patronizing" manner [Nebi, Noah]. These con-
cerns were presented as "advice" to future clinicians, as
explained by Max, who suggested, "make it relatable to
teens" and Chris who put forward,
. . . understand everything from the perspective of young people
because in a different age people view things differently and
sometimes we, erm, an issue might be minor for adults but for
young people it's big . . .
Hannah spoke about how a risk assessment ". . . was a bit
condescending," which made her think, "you're talking to me
like I'm five, I'm 18 this year . . .," displaying concerns about
her developmental stage was not being respected. Jenny dis-
cussed the differences between separate therapists in their
responses to her age. A previous therapy made her feel "a bit
like a child" by asking her to paint, however a later therapist
". . . just put things in a way which made me understand . . ."
Interestingly, no participant spoke about being spoken to as
"too much of an adult" but instead, considered being
responded to in a perceived developmentally inappropriate
manner as key barrier to older adolescent engagement.
Centrality of a human relationship.This subtheme is based
around the experience of the "human" elements to the rela-
tionship developed between participants and clinicians. Han-
nah sums up this subtheme succinctly explaining she
experienced her clinician as "a real person."
Some participants made sense of this by describing rela-
tionships with therapists as similar to that with friends, but
with professional boundaries: ". . . it doesn't feel like I'm just
speaking to my therapist, I'm speaking to a friend . . . but
with a lot of knowledge!" [Anna]. Noah described his clini-
cian as "pro-friend-ssional" to indicate the balance between
amiability and professionalism. Others frequently used the
adjectives "nice" or "kind" when considering their clini-
cians. This was often difficult for participants to articulate
further when promoted, explaining that this was simply part
of them as people, for example, "I don't know, I think just
how she was" [Hannah].
An appreciation of authenticity was expressed, for exam-
ple, ". . . I thought she was genuinely maybe concerned . . ."
[Chris]. Valuing the authentic was shown by some partici-
pants by talking about the antithesis of this, and of "human"
relationships, which was expressed as concerns about for-
mality. Caroline explained, ". . . if I had got someone that,
like, . . . ok so like this [sat up straight], I know I wouldn't be
able to be honest, it just doesn't feel natural, like." Noah
expressed a concern about ". . . seeing someone who belonged
in a bank . . ." For Chris and Hannah, a lack of authenticity
was displayed by sensing clinicians were "forced to do their
jobs." The impact of this feared formality may have also
affected the participants' sense of safety, and judgment,
within the relationship. Hannah explained, "I wouldn't want
to open up as much" but experiencing a safe relationship lead
to "the kind of environment where I felt I could say anything
and I wouldn't be judged . . ."
Tangibility of techniques. This theme centers around therapeu-
tic techniques that have an active and practical element to
them--something the young person could "do." Most young
people spoke about appreciating the more concrete tech-
niques, which gave them the opportunity to actively "do"
something to aid their therapy, for example, Nebi spoke
about the use of thought diaries: "writ[ing] down my nega-
tive thoughts and [writing] down another thought that con-
tradicts that thought." Most participants referred to the
tangibility/"doing" techniques as "reassuring" [Caroline]
and proving evidence that therapy "actually helps" [Chris].
Rose found the "measureable progress" of practical help
beneficial, creating certainty about therapeutic aims and
facilitating an experience of "I'm getting help." Anna
explained, "the more she told me about how I can manage
my low moods, my anxiety, and sometimes my OCD, it
made me want to come here more."
Rose and Max spoke about how "just talking" [Rose],
"didn't really solve anything" [Max], and expressed the need
to be actively working to reduce the impact of symptomol-
ogy. This may have offered participants motivation to con-
tinue their engagement. "Seeing" improvement, and
understanding the "point" of therapy, signaled to participants
that engagement was necessary:
. . . we would write down experiments we were doing and at first
I wouldn't really do them, and then, I started to do more and
more of them, so it was good. [Nicole]
Jenny appeared to have preconceived ideas about what
constituted therapy, which later conflicted with what she expe-
rienced to be therapeutic: ". . . it was very practical and very
skills based and we didn't really talk about my feelings, so it
wasn't really therapy . . ." She further explained, "I felt more
prepared for my exams and that I could handle them . . . we
talked about specific techniques and things and, erm, yeah, it
felt like I'd actually, kind of, I'd achieved something . . ."
Noah, the only participant who did not discuss tangible tech-
niques, explained how engagement itself was his therapy: "a
big part of what helps about coming here is the routine of see-
ing people I've known for a long time . . ."
Discussion
The present study aimed to explore 16- to 18-year-old sense
making of their mental health service engagement experi-
ences and their understanding of contributory facilitators and
10 SAGE Open
barriers. As research focusing solely on older adolescent
engagement is limited, this contributes to a sparse evidence
base.
Links to Previous Research and Theory
The interplay between participant's understanding of their
engagement experience, and the context of the 16 to 18
developmental stages, was of key importance. Dominant
theories of adolescent development (e.g., Erikson, 1968)
propose separation from parents/adults occurs as adoles-
cents mature. Participants appeared to understand them-
selves to be reliant on adults to acknowledge their distress
and facilitate professional help seeking, possibly opposing
theoretical comprehension. Older adolescent experience
may differ from models suggesting this is wholly reliant on
adult input (Costello, Pescosolido, Angold, & Burns, 1998)
and partly supports models suggesting the key role of the
adolescent's "ecosystem" (McKay et al., 1995). Adult reli-
ance sat alongside participant's own internal cognitive
readiness to receive help, supporting previous models
(Broome et al., 2001). As the adolescent ages, a shift may
occur from total adult reliance, toward a developed sense of
cognitive preparedness, inner resolve, and responsibility
toward others (Christie & Viner, 2005). This reveals an
interplay between internal and external influences, and a
complexity around the phenomenon as a whole. Indeed, as
participants spoke about help seeking to make sense of their
engagement experience, further evidence is contributed to
the ideas around the difficulties of engagement conceptual-
ization (Staudt, 2007), and the blurred distinction between
help seeking and engagement. Some studies have spoken
about how peers are preferred to adults (e.g., Rickwood
et al., 2007) when it comes to help seeking/engagement.
However, the results of the present study suggest that, in
the first stages of engagement, the participants were in fact
reliant on adults.
Intricacy was also evident within the idea of develop-
mental appropriateness, reflected in the themes around
choice, transparency, and control. For some, having their
older adolescent status respected by "not-being-told-what-
to-do"/"not-being-patronised" was imperative. This sat
alongside appreciating "suggestions," "teen-relatibility,"
and tangible therapeutic techniques (which by their very
nature require clinician direction). This reveals an additional
layer of complexity around what is understood about
engagement facilitators/barriers. The key element of devel-
opmental appropriateness supports previous research
(Harper et al., 2014) as does the importance of within-ses-
sion topics (Broome et al., 2001). It is wondered whether
what distinguishes "being-told-what-to-do" and "sugges-
tions" is transparency of process. This in turn may aid a
sense of control. Indeed, the tangibility of techniques men-
tioned above may have also provided a sense of control, but
over symptomology rather than engagement. Experiencing
control is thought to be an important facilitator within ado-
lescent engagement (Bury, Raval, & Lyon, 2007).
During engagement, it appears there is a growth and evolu-
tion within the adolescent themselves, and the relationship they
have to the engagement process. As this progresses, the older
adolescent inner resolve, and perceived usefulness of therapy/
continued engagement, may be key in facilitating engagement.
This finding supports within-treatment engagement models
(King et al., 2014) around the need for client hope and the devel-
opment of confidence. It is wondered whether the human,
"informal" relationship developed with clinicians may take the
place of the initial trusted adult, with this engagement growth
existing on the foundations of the therapeutic relationship
(Harper et al., 2014). In opposition to models (Kazdin et al.,
1997), the role of the relationship between parent and therapist
did not emerge as a theme. This may be due to the developmen-
tal stage of participants. Parents may have a role in initial atten-
dance,butcontinuedattendanceismorereliantontheadolescent
themselves and the therapeutic relationship, rather than alliance
between parent and therapist. This may also not have been an
emergent theme as some participants actively requested for par-
ents to not attend sessions, and all therapy was 1:1 based.
The role of peers was limited within participants' narra-
tives. Research and theory suggest, as adolescents grow
older, a social shift occurs from family to peers (e.g.,
Bronfenbrenner, 1977). This implies their influence could
have been more present in the current study, however, it may
not have been considered to be of key significance to partici-
pant sense making. Previous research suggests peers play a
role within help seeking (e.g., Rickwood & Braithwaite,
1994); however, when considering the ongoing engagement
phenomenon, peer input may be less influential. The lack of
peer discussion may also be due to concerns around stigma
(Fisher et al., 1982). For example, peers may have been less
aware of service attendance due to participant concerns about
judgment. The role of stigma was also marked in its absence
from emergent themes. Stigma may play more of a role when
considering help seeking (Gulliver, Griffiths, & Christensen,
2010) rather than engagement. The lack of emergence of
peer and stigma themes may suggest that 16 to 18 engage-
ment is less of a "social" phenomenon than help seeking.
The impact of symptomology on engagement, and
engagement (de)motivation, is absent from models. Previous
research has investigated links between dropout and "diag-
nosis" (e.g., Johnson et al., 2008). The current study suggests
symptomology, rather than "diagnosis" may play a role in
engagement, especially around the interplay between initial
anticipation and determination to engage. This finding sup-
ports research recommending therapist exploration of ado-
lescent beliefs during engagement (Bury et al., 2007).
Study Strengths, Reflexivity, and Limitations
The employment of an exploratory design, rooted in older ado-
lescent lived experience, allowed for rich, participant-centered
Jones et al. 11
data to emerge. Semistructured interview encouraged partici-
pants to lead on discussions, and therefore, on the type of data
collected. As emergent themes were developed from partici-
pant sense making, the results of the study may reflect a unique
16- to 18-year-old­centric experience of a complex phenome-
non. The selection of IPAallowed for the specific older adoles-
cent developmental context to be explored in relation to
engagement understandings.
When considering reflexive research practice, partici-
pants may have experienced a separate engagement process
with the researcher, mirroring their wider service engage-
ment experience, for example, engaging, in part, due to con-
cerns about letting others down. Power dynamics, and social
desirability, may have affected the direction, and content of
interview, as it was unclear how the participants viewed and
responded to the researcher--either understanding them to
be a clinician based within the service, or as an independent
party. As the lead researcher was a trainee clinical psycholo-
gist, the role researcher-as-researcher and researcher-as-cli-
nician may have required more conscious negotiation of
positioning and adopted language, through the use of
reflexivity.
Recruitment procedure required clinicians to consider
potential participants from their caseloads. There is potential
bias here as participants may have been selected based on
certain clinician biases, that is, quality of relationships.
According to clinician reports, all adolescents approached
agreed to participate. This has possible implications around
power and the ability to say "no" to clinicians, meaning some
may have felt obliged to participate. There was variation in
the length of engagement among participants, which may
have influenced interview content, for example, around
strength of therapeutic relationships. As engagement may be
a phenomenon that varies over time (Cunningham et al.,
2009), and models suggest elements of initial engagement
may differ from ongoing engagement (e.g., Broome et al.,
2001; King et al., 2014), it is possible participants were mak-
ing sense of different stages of the phenomenon.
Respondent validation (Mays & Pope, 2000) was missing
from the current study due to a tight research timeline. There
has been debate about the necessity of this (Giorgi, 2006)
due to the interpretative nature of IPA. Exclusion criteria dic-
tated that more complex presentations were not included in
the current study, which limits applicability. However, IPA
on the whole is less focused on generalizability but more
with rich, deep exploration of the selected phenomenon.
Following guidance (Smith et al., 2009), a 50% cutoff of
emergent themes was adopted to ensure relevance to the
sample as a whole. This may have resulted in a less thorough
exploration of divergence across cases. As IPA is reliant on
researcher interpretation, despite the employment of reflex-
ivity and bracketing techniques, the potential for bias
remained in emergent theme development reflecting
researcher beliefs or preconceptions of the engagement
phenomenon.
Clinical Implications
The therapeutic relationship has been extensively researched
(e.g., Karver, Handelsman, Fields, & Bickman, 2006). The
current study suggests the area of this, which may be crucial
for clinicians to cultivate are the "human" elements--
remaining genuine and nonjudgmental, balancing amiability
with professionalism, and avoiding "formality." The promi-
nence of cognitive preparedness, determination, and antici-
pation before first session attendance was marked. This
suggests more consideration may need to be given to
engagement facilitation in the time between referral and
attendance. This may lie more with refining multiagency
service provision (Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental
Health [JCPMH], 2013) rather than direct clinical interven-
tion. Engagement may be facilitated by clinicians discuss-
ing cognitive preparedness (Bury et al., 2007), with
adolescents at initial attendance. By making sense of help
seeking (Reder & Fredman, 1996), and avoiding separating
this from engagement, clinicians may develop understand-
ing of client's idiosyncratic engagement facilitators and/or
barriers.
Emergent themes suggest the key importance of appropri-
ate responsiveness to developmental stage, through offered
control and transparency. Engagement may be facilitated by
clinicians involving clients in areas there may be potential
for control (such as, content of therapy sessions), transparent
about areas less open to change, and discussion of potential
disappointments with the service. Facilitating perception of
usefulness of sessions and tangibility of techniques may also
encourage engagement. The above suggests combining and
balancing the relational and cognitive, by providing key
developmentally appropriate engagement facilitation.
Future Research
As a key message throughout this study has been one of
developmental appropriateness, it may be important when
planning research, policy, or service developments to consult
young people on topics and design (YoungMinds, 2005,
2011) to maintain relevance to adolescent needs.
As the conceptualizations and boundaries between help
seeking and engagement remain blurred, further research
into the development of clearer definitions and models, from
the adolescent view, may be beneficial to ensure develop-
mentally appropriate theoretical progressions (Drieschner
et al., 2004; Weisz & Hawley, 2002).
Research into the relationship between factors internal
and external to adolescents, for example, inner resolve/
cognitive preparedness in relation to the role of families at
this developmental stage, may provide further insight into
the engagement phenomenon. This may in turn influence
the development of strategies targeting adolescents who
may be at risk of disengagement, or who do not seek ser-
vice help.

Conclusion
Due to the paucity of research, this IPA study aimed to inves-
tigate the 16- to 18-year-old understanding of their mental
health service engagement experience, facilitators, and barri-
ers. Overlap between help seeking and engagement under-
standings was demonstrated. The key role of developmental
context emerged, regarding autonomy negotiation and adult
reliance, and factors internal (e.g., inner resolve) and exter-
nal (e.g., family) to the adolescent. Participant experiences of
service buildings and policy also emerged. Implications for
clinical practice involved ensuring developmental respon-
siveness through cultivating a human therapeutic relation-
ship, and responding to cognitive preparedness, control, and
transparency. It was suggested future research focuses on
ensuring adolescent participation. Potential topics for inves-
tigation included developing help seeking and engagement
conceptualizations, and further investigation into 16- to
18-year-old experience of service buildings and policy.
