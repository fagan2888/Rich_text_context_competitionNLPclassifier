Research Question
When the severity of the 2007-09 financial crisis became apparent, governments and cen-
tral banks alike introduced unconventional policy measures to mitigate the spillover ef-
fects from the financial sector to the real economy. Equity injections into banks and asset
purchases were among the most frequently used measures. However, the measures were
conducted to different degrees across the countries. Against this background, it is of in-
terest to compare the same measures in an economy with the same structure in order to
evaluate their effectiveness.
Contribution
This paper contributes to this discussion by comparing different measures within the same
consistent framework of a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
model that allows for an elaborated financial sector with banks and a capital market and
in which loans are the main source of funding. Thus, the structure reflects the euro area.
We scrutinize the effects of outright purchases of both government and corporate bonds,
as well as of injections of equity into banks.
Results
Our results indicate that the injection of equity into the banking sector is more efficient
from a welfare perspective than asset purchases in order to mitigate tensions resulting
from the banking sector. Outright asset purchases, by contrast, must be conducted on
a larger scale in order to be quantitatively similarly successful in our economy, in which
non-market-based financing is the predominant source to obtain external funds for non-
financial corporations. However, too large equity injections start to harm welfare because
they cause additional volatility at some point. Furthermore, the origin of the financial
shock is important for the results. If financial stress does not stem from the banking
sector in the first place, the welfare-improving range of equity injections into banks is
very small because the default risk of non-financial firms matters.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Fragestellung
Im Zuge der Finanzkrise in den Jahren 2007-09 führten sowohl Regierungen als auch Zen-
tralbanken Sondermaßnahmen ein, um die Übertragungseffekte aus dem Finanzsektor auf
die Realwirtschaft abzumildern. Kapitalzuführungen in den Bankensektor und Wertpa-
pierankaufprogramme gehörten zu den am häufigsten verwendeten Maßnahmen. Diese
Maßnahmen wurden in den unterschiedlichen Ländern jedoch in einem unterschiedlichen
Ausmaß durchgeführt. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es von Interesse, die gleichen Maßnah-
men in einer gleichen Modellökonomie zu untersuchen und zu bewerten.
Beitrag
Dieses Papier trägt zu dieser Diskussion bei, indem es unterschiedliche Maßnahmen zur
Abmilderung einer Finanzkrise in einem einheitlichen konsistenten Rahmen untersucht.
Dabei wird ein Neu-Keynesianisches allgemeines Gleichgewichtsmodell herangezogen, dass
einen umfangreichen Finanzsektor mit Banken und Kapitalmarkt aufweist. In diesem
Modell greifen nicht-finanzielle Unternehmen primär auf Buchkredite als externe Finan-
zierungsquelle zurück, womit das Modell die Struktur im Euroraum reflektiert. In diesem
Rahmen werden Offenmarktkäufe von Staatsanleihen und Anleihen nicht-finanzieller Un-
ternehmen sowie Kapitalzuführungen in den Bankensektor untersucht.
Ergebnisse
Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Kapitalzuführungen in den Bankensektor vor dem Hintergrund
einer Wohlfahrtsbetrachtung effizienter sind als Offenmarktkäufe von Wertpapieren, um
finanziellen Stress im Bankensektor abzumildern. Offenmarktkäufe von Wertpapieren
müssen in dieser Ökonomie, in der Bankfinanzierung bei nicht-finanziellen Unternehmen
dominiert, in einem stärkeren Ausmaß durchgeführt werden, um gleichermaßen quanti-
tativ erfolgreich zu sein. Allerdings beginnen zu starke Kapitalzuführen die Wohlfahrt
wiederum zu mindern, da sie ab einem bestimmten Punkt zusätzliche Volatilität in-
duzieren. Zudem ist jedoch der Ursprung des Finanzstress für die Ergebnisse von Be-
deutung. Entstammt der Finanzstress nicht dem Bankensektor, sondern ist er primär auf
die Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit von nicht-finanziellen Unternehmen zurückzuführen, ist der
Bereich von Wohlfahrtssteigerungen bei Kapitalzuführungen in den Bankensektor sehr
gering.

Mitigating Financial Stress in a Bank-Financed
Economy: Equity Injections into Banks or Purchases

Abstract
This paper compares the consequences of equity injections into banks with purchases
of corporate and government bonds in a financial crisis situation using a New Keyne-
sian model in which non-financial firms predominantly take non-market-based debt
from banks instead of issuing securities. Our results show that equity injections into
banks are more welfare enhancing than asset purchases following a financial shock lo-
cated in the banking sector. Equity injections remove the frictions that have initiated
the stress and, at the same time, relax borrowing conditions. Outright purchases
also increase welfare but lower returns with negative effects on banks' profits, while
the effect on asset prices to stabilize banks' balance sheets is of minor importance
due to the dominance of non-market-based debt. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
the origin of the financial shock matters crucially for the efficacy of measures.

1 Introduction
When the severity of the 2007-09 financial crisis became apparent, governments and cen-
tral banks alike introduced unconventional policy measures to mitigate the spillover effects
from the financial sector to the real economy. Particularly given the large amount of fi-
nancial resources used to fight the recession, policy makers are interested in assessing
the efficacy of the unconventional measures taken. Moreover, it is also important to
know which measures are most suited to which conditions. This paper contributes to
this discussion by comparing different measures within the same consistent framework of
a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model that allows for an elaborated
financial sector with banks and a capital market and in which loans are the main source
of funding.
Countries and public agents took manifold measures during the financial crisis. On
the one hand, central banks started to buy private assets and government bonds out-
right as well as providing liquidity to the banking sector.1 On the other hand, policy
measures conducted by the central banks were often flanked by operations undertaken
by governments. Their actions to support the financial sector mainly centered on the
recapitalization of banks.2 A number of papers investigate empirically the success of
unconventional monetary policy measures. Empirical studies mostly try to evaluate the
effects on interest rates or yields, while the effect on the real economy is not explicitly
modeled (D'Amico, English, Lopéz-Salido, and Nelson, 2012; Gagnon, Raskin, Remache,
and Sack, 2011; Hamilton and Wu, 2012; Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011;
Swanson, 2011). The borrowing conditions for non-financial firms seemed to be affected
positively in the USA (e.g. D'Amico et al., 2012; Gagnon et al., 2011; Krishnamurthy
and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011) and the UK (e.g. Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens, and Tong, 2011;
Joyce and Tong, 2012). Only few studies scrutinize empirically the effects of unconven-
tional measures on the real economy. The study of Baumeister and Benati (2013) is geared
to the USA and the UK, while Kapetanios, Mumtaz, Stevens, and Theodoridis (2012) fo-
cus on the UK. Both papers report significant effects from asset purchases on output and
inflation. In this respect, the ECB's unconventional measures are also reported to be
successful (see Fahr, Motto, Rostagno, Smets, and Tristani, 2011; Giannone, Lenza, Pill,
and Reichlin, 2012; Peersman, 2011). An inherent problem with empirical work is that
1Outright purchases were primarily conducted by the Federal Reserve with its Large Scale Asset
Purchase Programs (LSAP 1 to 3), the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England but also by the Eurosystem
with its Covered Bond Purchase Programs (CBPP 1 and 2). Liquidity was provided in a variety of ways;
the Federal Reserve offered banks inter alia the opportunity to obtain central bank money by putting
advances forward as collateral. One major element of the Eurosystem's crisis resolution strategy was
the introduction of full allotment for central bank lending in conjunction with longer-term refinancing
operations (LTROs), which allowed banks to receive reserves for a longer fixed period of time. Similar
policy instruments were also applied by the Bank of Japan. An essential tool for many central banks was
the expansion of the list of assets eligible as collateral together with a reduction in haircuts for central
bank lending.
2In the USA, the Treasury Department established the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which
contained several instruments. One of these was the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), which provided
additional capital to financial institutions in order to compensate for losses by buying preferred stocks, for
instance. Similar tools were also used in Japan and in Europe. In Germany, for instance, the government
introduced the Special Financial Market Stabilization Fund ("Finanzmarktstabilisierungsfonds") that not
only guaranteed banks' capital issues but also recapitalized banks directly.
1
the effects of one specific measure cannot clearly be isolated because different measures
were applied simultaneously which results in an identification problem.
To circumvent this problem, theoretical models have been developed to study the ef-
fects of different measures in isolation, i.e. policy tools are imitated to find an answer to
the question of macroeconomic feedback effects. Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler
and Karadi (2013) can, in principle, demonstrate that asset purchases have important ef-
fects using New Keynesian DSGE models. The results of Dedola, Karadi, and Lombardo
(2013) go in the same direction by stressing the potential of domestic programs to spill
over internationally. Other models provide a more general result: asset purchases im-
prove financial intermediation in times of financial stress but are ineffective in other cases
(Cúrdia and Woodford, 2011; Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003; Williamson, 2012). Unlike
other studies, Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero (2012) report only marginal effects of asset pur-
chases on output and inflation for the USA.3 Besides asset purchases, the recapitalization
of banks, by providing net worth, seems to mitigate tensions in the financial sector very
significantly (Christiano and Ikeda, 2013a; He and Krishnamurthy, 2013; Hirakata, Sudo,
and Ueda, 2013; Sandri and Valencia, 2013; Zeng, 2013).
Following Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler and Karadi (2013), outright pur-
chases of assets seem to succeed in mitigating financial stress in economies which rely
on market-based financing.4 In a market-based economy, the stabilization of asset prices
has two effects: on the one hand, the value of these assets is supported, which stabilizes
the balance sheet of their holders. Asset purchases indirectly recapitalize the financial
intermediaries in this environment, and lending to the non-financial sector is facilitated.
On the other hand, borrowing conditions in the real sector improve at the same time.
However, few papers evaluate the effects of outright purchases in an economy in which
non-financial firms predominantly rely on non-market-based financing by taking loans,
i.e. in an economy in which the second channel is of minor importance. Such a setting
comes closer to the structure of the euro area's economy compared to the US economy.5
Market-based debt is much more common in the USA than in the euro area, and equity
consists mostly of outside equity in the USA and not of inside equity, as in the euro
area.6 From this point of view, it is of interest to investigate how asset purchases affect a
non-market-based economy.
Our paper's main contribution is as follows: We draw on a fully specified New Key-
nesian general equilibrium model, in which non-financial firms predominantly take non-
market-based loans from banks in order to investigate the efficacy of outright purchases
of bonds and the recapitalization of banks in a financial crisis situation. We compare not
only the qualitative properties but also the quantitative effects of the policy measures in
a model economy that exhibits features of and is calibrated to the euro area. Besides
investigating the dynamics, we evaluate the measures from a welfare perspective. In this
respect, we differentiate between financial shocks with two different origins.
Banks are faced with constraints resulting from agency problems with their creditors
3Chen et al. (2012) estimate a DSGE model for the USA and simulate large-scale asset purchases.
4This conclusion follows from their setting in which assets with market-determined prices dominate
the balance sheet of the financial intermediary.
5See Table 6 in the appendix.
6Market-based debt means that the debt instrument has a market-determined price that can change.
Conversely, non-market-based debt is not traded on a market and has a price of unity.

(Christiano and Ikeda, 2013b; Gertler and Kiyotaki, 2010; Gertler and Karadi, 2011;
Cúrdia and Woodford, 2011). Moreover, agency problems also exist between banks and
non-financial firms (Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist, 1999; Christiano, Motto, and Ros-
tagno, 2014). For this reason, it is necessary to draw on a model that allows for financial
frictions on both sides of banks' balance sheet, i.e. to allow for two-sided financial con-
tracting. Some recent contributions construct such a framework by relying on the costly
state verification framework on both sides of financial contracting (Hirakata, Sudo, and
Ueda, 2011; Hirakata et al., 2013; Sandri and Valencia, 2013; Zeng, 2013). This allows
defaults in both the real and the banking sector to be taken into account. However,
changes in bank lending rates reflect market forces and costs related to bank defaults. We
want to isolate market forces from default costs in the banking sector because the latter
means bank runs or depositor insurances need to be taken into account. Nevertheless,
bankruptcy costs stemming from the real sector might be relevant for the banking sector.
For this reason, we combine the approaches of Bernanke et al. (1999) and Gertler and Kiy-
otaki (2010).7 Thus, we assume a costly state verification problem between the financial
sector and non-financial firms, while funders of banks are confronted with a costly en-
forcement problem. In doing so, we additionally introduce two distinct debt instruments
for non-financial firms: non-market-based debt (loans) and market-based debt (corporate
bonds). Consequently, our banks intermediate funds to non-financial firms by granting
loans and buying corporate bonds. Furthermore, we allow our banks to hold government
bonds.
In this framework, we scrutinize the effects of outright purchases of both government
and corporate bonds, as well as of injections of equity into banks (build up of net worth).
These measures are similar to the measures investigated in Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010),
Gertler and Karadi (2013), Christiano and Ikeda (2013a), Hirakata et al. (2013), Sandri
and Valencia (2013), and He and Krishnamurthy (2013).8 Compared to Gertler and
Kiyotaki (2010), our approach makes two additional contributions to the literature: firstly,
we apply a New Keynesian model with nominal and financial frictions instead of a real
business cycle framework, and secondly, we model the distinct policy measures within the
same model. Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) basically apply the same modeling framework;
nevertheless, they tailor their exact model to the policy measure under investigation.
This can potentially neglect important feedback effects, which we do not exclude a priori
through the construction of our model. As in our case, Christiano and Ikeda (2013a)
also allow for tax-financed measures conducted by the government.9 Furthermore, they
also compare the effects of different intervention policies that are close to ours across
different models but do not embed these measures into a macroeconomic model as we
do.10 Although Gertler and Karadi (2013) also consider purchases of government bonds
in a New Keynesian model, our framework allows for one additional asset on banks'
7This setting is similar to Rannenberg (2013).
8Both papers introduce financial friction between the banks and their creditors. In the model of
Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010), banks can divert a fraction of the financial resources they receive from
their creditors, which is why bank net worth is important to guarantee repayment. Christiano and Ikeda
(2013a) formulate, inter alia, the financial frictions slightly differently by stating that bankers must make
an effort to choose projects with good returns (hidden action). Similarly, net worth helps to stabilize the
pay-off.
9In their model, the tax is a lump-sum tax rather than a distortionary tax on wages as in our case.
10Their focus is on the qualitative properties of different financial sector models.

balance sheets, whereas the main financial instrument in our model are loans rather than
securities, as in their model.11 He and Krishnamurthy (2013), by contrast, do not rely
on the New Keynesian framework. Regarding the question of capital injections, Hirakata
et al. (2013) and Sandri and Valencia (2013) are closer to us. They draw on the costly state
verification problem to motivate both financial frictions and investigate equity injections.
However, we are able to investigate equity injections and asset purchases in the same
framework simultaneously, which they are not.
Our results indicate that the injection of inside equity, i.e. enhancing banks' net
worth, is more efficient from a welfare perspective than asset purchases in order to miti-
gate tensions resulting from the banking sector.12 Outright asset purchases, by contrast,
must be conducted on a larger scale in order to be quantitatively similarly successful in
our economy, in which non-market-based financing is for non-financial corporations the
predominant source to obtain external funds. However, too large equity injections start
to harm welfare because they cause additional volatility at some point. Furthermore, the
origin of the financial shock is important for the results. If financial stress does not stem
from the banking sector in the first place, the welfare-improving range of equity injections
into banks is very small because the default risk of non-financial firms matters.
Our results complement those of Gertler and Karadi (2011) or Gertler and Karadi
(2013) who investigate asset purchases for an economy in which banks predominantly
hold securities. In those cases, asset purchases stabilize the value of banks' assets and
consequently banks' net worth. In our case, asset purchases primarily reduce returns,
which also weakens banks' net worth by reduced profits. Because of the dominance of
non-market-based debt in banks' balance sheets, the stabilizing role of asset purchases on
asset prices is of minor importance. Thus, equity injections into banks are very powerful
if the banking sector causes financial stress because equity injections alleviate financial
frictions.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a description
and derivation of the model. In Section 3, we discuss calibration and the obtained steady
state values. Dynamics are presented in Section 4. Here we start with a comparison of the
dynamics resulting from our model with those of standard models following a monetary
policy shock and a productivity shock. Then we discuss two types of financial shock
before turning to the investigation of the policy measures. Section 5 concludes.
2 Model
The modeling framework relies on the well-known class of DNK models, as outlined in
Smets and Wouters (2003) or Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). A standard
DNK model is extended to include a financial sector in the sense that we introduce both
a bank and a capital market which both allocate financial resources. There is a financial
contracting problem between the real sector and the financial market and between the
bank and its creditors. While in the first case lenders are confronted with a costly state
verification problem, as outlined in Bernanke et al. (1999), the agency problem between

12These results are principally in line with Christiano and Ikeda (2013a) and He and Krishnamurthy
(2013).

the bank and its shareholders is modeled as proposed by Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010)
and Gertler and Karadi (2011). This allows us to abstract from default problems in the
banking sector and is proposed and discussed by Rannenberg (2013). Our model consists
of households, two types of entrepreneur, intermediate goods firms, final goods firms,
mutual funds, banks and a public sector as active agents.
A continuum of households save, consume and supply labor to the intermediate goods
firms. Households receive income from labor and from financial assets to consume a bundle
of final goods, purchased from final goods firms. The financial wealth of households arises
from holdings of corporate and government bonds, and bank deposits.
We distinguish between two types of entrepreneur (type A and type B entrepreneurs)
to introduce a role for different debt instruments. Both entrepreneurs process newly pro-
duced physical capital which is exposed to the individual skills of each entrepreneur and
is then rented out to intermediate goods firms. Related to the entrepreneur, we allow
for two different stocks of capital.13 The two types of entrepreneur own different types
of capital which are both used complementarily in the production of intermediate goods.
Both types of entrepreneur can finance their projects by raising external funds in excess of
their net worth. Both types of physical capital are rented out to intermediate goods firms,
which combine physical capital with rented labor to produce differentiated intermediate
goods. The intermediate goods firms sell their goods in a market of monopolistic com-
petition to final goods producers. Finally, the final goods firms bundle the differentiated
goods into a homogenous final good. The final good can be used for consumption, in
capital utilization, as investment goods, or as government expenditures.
Banks hold two different types of asset received from the private sector: loans and
bonds from entrepreneurs. Moreover, lending banks purchase government bonds. They
obtain funds from households through deposits.
2.1 Households
The economy is populated by a continuum of households which are indexed by h with
h  (0, 1). Each h-th household decides on the supply of labor, how much to consume
and to save, and on the allocation of its wealth. Households' utility function is given in
Equation (1)

with discount factor  and the remaining variables described in this subsection. House-
holds evaluate consumption relative to an external habit stock that is the value of the
last period's aggregate consumption. In this respect, the term hC reflects the impor-
tance of external habits with hC  (0, 1), and  determines the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution.
The households supply differentiated labor services (Nh,t
) to the intermediate goods
sector. Because of a monopolistically competitive labor market in which labor services
are imperfect substitutes, each household has market power to set its nominal wage (Wt
).
13This is a slight modification of standard DNK models. A similar approach is often applied if impatient
and patient households are introduced, for example, with applications to housing markets.
5
Following Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000), we assume, in analogy to Calvo pricing,
that the household is not able to renegotiate its nominal wage each period. Instead, it can
only reoptimize with a specific probability (1 - w). In periods in which the household
cannot renegotiate, it follows an indexation rule ~
Wt
= (t-1
)w
()1-w

, where w
is the weighting parameter. A labor agency is introduced that buys differentiated labor
from households and pays the individual wage in order to produce a representative labor
aggregate as output

where w is the degree of substitution. By minimizing the costs of producing this aggre-
gator, the labor agency takes the wage rates of each differentiated labor input as given.
From this optimization problem follows the demand for labor of household h for use in

With the knowledge of demand for its labor, the household can proceed with determining

by making use of Equation (3). The term  reflects the inverse Frisch elasticity. Changes
in rates of inflation until date s, which are important for indexation, are summarized in
w
t+s
in Equation (5). Before utility maximization is carried out, the optimal nominal
wage emerges from a sub-problem in which the household minimizes its disutility of labor
by choosing its nominal wage given the labor demand of firms.14
Similar to Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) or Gertler and Karadi (2011), we assume that
some household members become banker managers who operate banks. The share of
household members in the banking sector in each period is sBM . In order to keep the
shares constant over time, we assume that exactly the same number of workers become
bankers as bankers return to the goods producing sector. The probability of staying a
banker pBM is exogenously fixed and does not change over time. The profits each bank
manager potentially earns are not transferred to the household before the bank manager
leaves the bank, which happens with a probability of 1 - pBM .15 In addition, a specific
share se of households becomes entrepreneurs. Like bank managers, entrepreneurs survive
with a probability of pe. During the time they are entrepreneurs, household members
14The derivation is presented in the appendix.
15The reason why bankers exit lending banks is to guarantee that the lending banks do not accumulate
equity indefinitely (see Gertler and Karadi (2011) or Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010)).

accumulate net wealth, which is transferred back to the household when they leave the
entrepreneurial sector.
Households place deposits (Dt
) with banks, buy risk-free bonds which consist of short-
term Bshort,gov
t
and long-term government bonds (Bgov
t
) and (short-term) bonds issued
by a public agency BIA

bonds, summarized as short-term public sector debt BPS

it
, while they obtain the risk-free return rB,gov
t
on long-term government bonds which bear
a coupon of igov
0
and are traded at price QB,gov
t
.17
In order to allow for longer-term bonds, we follow Woodford (2001) and assume that
only a fraction of the government bonds (B,gov) issued last period are repaid this period.18

with B,gov as a scaling parameter. This approach is based on Gertler and Karadi (2013)
and takes arguments from the "preferred habitat" theory of the term structure into ac-
count.
Furthermore, households own intermediate goods firms and receive dividend payments
(Divh,t
) at the end of the period from them. Taken together, households earn money from
interest payments on their bond and deposit holdings, labor income and the dividends
paid by intermediate goods firms. Since the supply of differentiated labor leads to different
streams of income, we follow Erceg et al. (2000) and assume that households bought state-
contingent securities with a lump-sum transfer. This is to make sure that all agents are
able to consume the same amount each period, i.e. to equalize income differences among
the continuum of households. Households' expenditures are allotted to consumption, to
lump-sum taxes, to lump-sum transfers including payments to entrepreneurs and bank
managers, h,t
, and to the purchase of financial assets, i.e. public sector bonds, corporate
bonds, and deposits.
16We introduce long-term bonds mainly because we want to allow government bonds to have a time-
varying market price, similar to Gertler and Karadi (2013).
17In the following, we mean default-free if we talk about risk-free rates and spreads.
18Chen et al. (2012) also allow for a maturity structure. While they use the yield-to-maturity in their
model, we draw on the period return.

From the no-arbitrage conditions follow that each household holds the same amount
of assets, which is why we can aggregate easily. First-order conditions can be found in
the technical appendix.
2.2 Final goods firms
We assume that there is a continuum of intermediate goods producers in a market with
monopolistic competition where the i-th firm sells the i-th differentiated good to final
goods firms. The final goods sector is characterized by a representative final goods pro-
ducer that operates under conditions of perfect competition. The final good (Yt
) is a
composite of the continuum of differentiated intermediate goods (

where the parameter  determines the degree of substitution among the intermediate

2.3 Intermediate goods firms
The intermediate goods firms plan to rent capital (Ki,t
) from the entrepreneurs and ho-
mogeneous labor (Ni,t
) from the households for use in production. As in standard DNK
models, we assume a standard production function of the Cobb-Douglas type with con-

where the term  is the share of capital in production. The term At
allows for (stationary)
shocks on total factor productivity with disturbance A

= AAt-1

,
where A is an autoregressive parameter. We allow for different types of capital in the pro-
duction process such that
Ki,t

, where A and B refer to type A and B entrepreneurs and
ws is the share of utilized type A entrepreneurs' capital in utilized total capital. We mod-
ify the production technology because we later introduce two different debt instruments.
For this reason, we will attribute the production of one capital good to one specific debt
instrument.19
As is well known, the optimization problem each intermediate goods firm faces is
twofold. On the one hand, firms minimize their real costs by choosing inputs given their
production technology. Thus,

The terms rk,A
t
and rk,B
t
are the cost of capital and wt
is the real wage. The first order
conditions for the minimization problem of each intermediate goods firm are presented in
the technical appendix from Equations (66) to (69). With their help it can be shown that
the ratio of type B entrepreneurs' capital to type A entrepreneurs' capital as well as the
capital to labor ratios are the same across all firms.
Since the intermediate goods firms operate in a market with monopolistic competition,
they are basically free to set the price optimally given the demand for their goods as
presented in Equation (9). Based on Calvo (1983), optimal pricing is only possible with
a probability of 1 - . Furthermore, we assume that the remaining fraction of firms that
cannot optimize their price set the price equal to its value last period multiplied by the
past rate of inflation (t-1
) which is weighted by the steady state rate of inflation ().20
19Fisher (1999) also introduces heterogeneous financially constrained firms and proceeds similarly. In
contrast to him, we do not introduce two complete goods producing sectors with fixed input shares and
a bundling technology to produce the final good. Instead, we split up the physical stock of capital. Our
approach allows us in a sense to endogenize the financing decision in terms of the intermediate goods by
varying the capital input.
20The price indexation is a combination of the indexation rules in Erceg et al. (2000) and Smets and
Wouters (2003) and can also be found in Christiano et al. (2014), whereas we replace the target inflation
rate with the steady state rate of inflation.

2.4 Capital producers
The economy is populated by capital producers that are owned by households and work in
a market of perfect competition. Capital producers produce two different sorts of capital.
By doing so, they combine undepreciated physical capital with investment goods of class
e to produce new physical capital of the same class.

2.5 Entrepreneurs
In reality, it is often the case that access to the financial market is restricted for some kinds
of enterprises. The difference in entrepreneurs' size can be seen as one reason why different
financial segments are used (see, for instance, Krishnaswami, Spindt, and Subramaniam,
1999). Nevertheless, size-related transaction costs are only one explanation for the varying
access to the capital market. In principle, the availability of sufficient public information
on creditworthiness mainly explains why firms enter the capital market (see Diamond,
1984; Fama, 1985; Boot and Thakor, 1997 or Denis and Mihov, 2003). Since our aim is
to look at different ways of financing debt, we need to introduce two different financial
sectors, which is rarely done in the literature. Fisher (1999), for example, introduces
heterogeneity in a setting similar to Bernanke et al. (1999) and distinguishes between a
10
financially constrained and an unstrained sector.21 De Fiore and Uhlig (2012) embed a
framework of heterogeneous firms developed in De Fiore and Uhlig (2011) in a general
equilibrium model. As opposed to Fisher (1999), all firms have private information,
whereas financial intermediaries have different degrees of access to information.22
We principally follow Bernanke et al. (1999) and assume that the economy is populated
by a continuum of entrepreneurs that buy capital from capital producers and transform
the capital into new capital exposed to an idiosyncratic processing risk. After observing
the shock, the entrepreneurs rent the capital out to goods producers and receive rents
from them. Since the entrepreneurs finance the capital purchases from their own net
worth and external funds, the realization of the idiosyncratic shock affects their capacity
to service debt (e.g. Bernanke et al., 1999; Christiano et al., 2014).
By introducing two financially constrained firms, our model is closely related to the
approaches of Fisher (1999) and De Fiore and Uhlig (2012). We split the continuum
of entrepreneurs, with m  [0, 1], into two groups e  [A, B] with A : m  [0, )
and B : m  [ , 1]. Both groups face different degrees of credit constraint because
entrepreneurs' creditors have different degrees of insight into shocks to their skills (i.e. to
their productivity e
t
). The productivity shock on type A entrepreneurs' skills A
t
can be
observed by paying a fixed fraction µA of the amount that can be recovered in the case
of a default. Similarly, the productivity process of the type B entrepreneurs B
t
is not
exclusive to the borrowers. However, it can only be discovered paying a greater fraction
µB, with µB > µA, of the realizable assets. Since monitoring type B entrepreneurs is more
costly than monitoring type A entrepreneurs, the former will solely rely on bank finance,
while the latter issue bonds in the capital market, which is basically in line with De Fiore
and Uhlig (2011).23 Both entrepreneurs are modeled in accordance with BGG with the
possibility of a steady state default, whereas the default risk of a type B entrepreneur is
greater than for a type A entrepreneur.24
21In his model, the continuum of firms consists of two groups: one which has private information on
their shock and one which shares the same information set with the financial intermediaries. Hence, the
first group is credit constrained because lenders are confronted with a costly state verification problem
(CSV) while the second group is unconstrained.
22De Fiore and Uhlig (2011) introduce three different shocks to the productivity of goods producers.
The first shock is common knowledge, while the second can only be observed in relation to costs. Finally,
the third shock is private. Each shock plays its own role. While the first shock introduces heterogeneity
across firms, the second justifies the existence of a bank. The last shock is important for the credit
constraint.
23In our model, each group makes use of only one specific form of debt finance. This is basically similar
to De Fiore and Uhlig (2011).
24For the sake of simplicity, we could call our two types of entrepreneur "small" (B) and "large" (A),
although this distinction does not follow from their individual net worth, i.e. the net worth of the
smallest entrepreneur in the A-group is not necessarily greater than that of the largest in the B-group.
The labeling of the entrepreneurs would be arbitrary. We could have also defined one group "high-risk"
and another group "low-risk" entrepreneurs (see, for instance, Bolton and Freixas, 2000) but we do not
want to stress the difference in risk too much. A more severe conceptual assumption is that there is no
transition between the groups. However, Levy and Hennessy (2007) also work with an ad hoc assumption
concerning the distinction between two types of firms. In their model, endowment issues are relevant
for the decision between equity and debt finance. The same is true for Fisher (1999) who makes an ad
hoc assumption concerning credit constrained and unconstrained firms. Although the decision process
is endogenized to a higher extent, each firm in De Fiore and Uhlig (2011, 2012) relies on one type of
financing in the end. Nevertheless, our assumption is rather ad hoc but could be relaxed in a further
11
For capital processing, the entrepreneurs' individual skills are of importance and the
entrepreneurs decide on the capital utilization (ue
m,t
), which can be varied. The skills
of both type A and B entrepreneurs are subject to idiosyncratic shocks which affect
the physical properties of the capital. These shocks m,t
are drawn from a lognormal
distribution with unit mean and are independent over time and across entrepreneurs. For
the m-th entrepreneur, we obtain the amount of processed capital ^

For the case where the value of the project is exactly equal to the debt service, we can

with Ze

as the gross contract rate. We depart from the original BGG model and do not
assume that the contract rate is state-contigent, which means that the contract is signed
before the shocks materialize. Thus, we follow slightly Benes and Kumhof (2011) and
Zhang (2009) and replace the realized capital return by the expected capital return. This
timing convention proxies reality more closely, particularly for bank financing, and allows
for unexpected defaults in the period of the shocks. As a consequence, the productivity
threshold must be understood as an ex ante value. Given the expected gross return of
the project and its value as well as the borrowed amount, this threshold is linked to
the default-free risky bond rate. Equation (15) accordingly characterizes the optimal
contract. Since the contract is negotiated based upon the expected capital return, we
have to distinguish between ex ante and ex post thresholds. After the shock has occurred,
the realized (gross) capital return emerges as

For the entrepreneur, there automatically arise two different scenarios in terms of
debt service. If the realized idiosyncratic shock is greater than (or equal to) the ex post
threshold, he will be able to repay his debt as contractually agreed and keep the difference
as net earnings. However, a realization of the shock that is below the ex post threshold
level results in a default, and the entrepreneur has to liquidate the remaining amount

completely in order to satisfy its lenders. As a consequence, the shock also affects the
realized return on capital, as denoted by Rk,e

and given in Equation (16). Thus, the ex

, below which defaults occur, turns out to be

with variables as already defined (see, for instance, Zhang, 2009).25
Based upon these considerations, the expected earnings of the m-th entrepreneur (Ee

can be calculated based upon the expected capital return and the ex ante productivity
threshold as

The first term on the right-hand side characterizes the expected earnings from the project
by taking all realizations for e

into account, and the second term on the
right-hand side reflects the payments to satisfy the debt contract. For e
m,t+1
< e,ex ante
m
,
the entrepreneur would be left with no earnings. The function F e
m,t+1
; e
t
in Equation
(18) is the cumulative density function for realization of e
m
which means that its value
for e,ex ante
m
is the related ex ante default probability. The standard deviation e
t
of the
distribution can be time-varying, i.e. deviating from its steady state value e, and obeys
an i.i.d. stochastic process where the variance of log  is 2
t
and  is an autoregressive
parameter
log (e
t
) = (1 - ) log (e) + log e
t-1
+ fin
t
.
A time-varying standard deviation gives rise to the possibility of a "financial risk shock"
fin
t
, which increases the range of realizations of the shocks (see, for instance, Christiano
et al. (2014)). The financial risk shock affects both entrepreneurs simultaneously.
Entrepreneurs' net worth (NWe
m,t
) arises from two sources: the net value (NV e
m,t
) of
the project and transfers from households (we
m
). In order to prevent entrepreneurs from
accumulating net worth indefinitely, which would make external funding unnecessary, we
follow BGG and assume that in each period entrepreneurs leave the market with a given
probability of 1 - pe and are exactly replaced by new entrepreneurs just endowed with
households' transfers to keep the population of entrepreneurs stable. For the evolution of
net worth we obtain
NWe
m,t+1
= peNV e
m,t
+ we
m
. (18)
The optimal bond contract for the lenders reveals that the lenders want to earn as
much as they receive by investing in a risk-free asset. That is the reason why lenders'
opportunity costs must be equal to the risk-free rate. Where the idiosyncratic shock
exceeds the cut-off value, the lender receives the contractual interest payments. The
converse probability of the default probability at the cut-off value of the shocks yields the
probability of contractual payments. For the range of realizations of the shocks that are
below the ex ante cut-off value e,ex ante
m
, the assets of the borrower are expected to be
25Note that the realized rate of return enters Equation (17).
13
liquidated in order to partly redeem the debt contract. Before collecting the remaining
assets, the lender has to observe the state of the borrower. Information is asymmetrically
distributed, however. While the entrepreneur can always assess its situation, the financial
intermediary cannot observe the state of the entrepreneur at no charge. As a consequence,
the creditor has to pay transaction costs, which lower its repayments in the case of a
default. It is assumed that the transaction costs are proportional to the realizable assets.
These considerations are summarized in Equation (19)

becomes relevant in intermediaries' participation constraint for the type A entrepreneurs.
As with government bonds, we allow for long-term bonds with a specific maturity struc-
ture, which is modeled according to Woodford (2001) with maturity parameter B,corp.26
While QB,corp
t
is the price of the bond, icorp
0
denotes fixed coupon payments. Regarding
the loan contract of type B entrepreneurs, the loan rate is not state-contingent. For the
bond rate, the same is, in principle, true although it only holds for expected terms. What
can be seen in Equation (20) is that, as long as the default is not unexpected, its costs
are taken into account in bond pricing. Nevertheless, the contract is written before the
productivity shock on A is realized, i.e. before the capital return is known. As a con-
sequence of the non-state contingent nature of the contracts, deviations of the realized
capital return from its expected value matter to debt servicing capacity (see Equation
(17)) and, therefore, affect intermediaries' return. From this setting it follows that finan-
cial intermediaries face ex post losses B,e
t
that can cannot be completely diversified
ex ante (as is assumed in the original BGG setting). These ex post losses are defined as

which is similar to Benes and Kumhof (2011). Ex post losses can occur if the realization
of the shock leaves the realized capital return below its expected value so that the risky

contract rate is not sufficient to compensate the intermediaries for all defaults. The losses
can be split up into two parts: the additional losses, because the realized default rate
F(e,ex post
t
) is above its ex ante value F(e,ex ante
t
) (upper line on the right-hand side in
Equation (21)), and the reduced amount of realizable assets through defaults (lower line
on the right-hand side in Equation (21)).
Each entrepreneur maximizes its expected profits from Equation (18) by choosing the
amount of capital and the cut-off point given the corresponding intermediaries' expected
zero-profit conditions as presented in Equation (19).27
In an environment with a contract period of one period, the net value is equivalent
to net earnings, which are simply the earnings net of the costs of the credit. Hence, we
obtain for the aggregated net value

where we have made use of the aggregated version of Equation (18). In conjunction with
Equation (18) and the omission of indexes, we obtain the aggregated law of motion for
the entrepreneurs' net worth. In order to be compensated ex ante for default costs, the
creditors add them to the risk-free rate as a fixed proportion (µe) of realizable assets.
After processing the capital with the help of individual skill, the entrepreneurs decide
on capital utilization, which entails costs in the form of
(ue
m,t
) =
rk,e
k,e
(exp k,e ue
m,t
- 1 - 1). (23)
The aggregate amount of physical capital distributed to the intermediate goods sector,
after the second stage is accomplished, is obtained by aggregating over the distribution
of the productivity shock and over the continuum of entrepreneurs.

(24)
Equation (24) shows that shocks to entrepreneurs' skills do not matter for the economy
as a whole because the idiosyncratic risk can be diversified perfectly and the utilization
rate is identical across all entrepreneurs.
27An important difference between the original BGG setting and our setting is that the intermediaries
expect zero profits in our model, while in the BGG model zero profits hold every period (see, for instance,
Benes and Kumhof, 2011).
15
2.6 Financial intermediaries
2.6.1 Mutual funds
Mutual funds are introduced to proxy the capital market. This idea is lent on Bernanke
et al. (1999) and Christiano et al. (2014). Our mutual funds serve as intermediaries that
channel funds from banks, rent them out by buying bonds from type A entrepreneurs and
operate on zero profits. Our main objective is to model the linkage between the issuance
of bonds and the financing by banks. In a decentralized market structure, different banks
could earn different ex post returns (see Equation (15)) because some banks hold bonds
issued by entrepreneurs that do not default, while some have purchased bonds from en-
trepreneurs that do. By introducing mutual funds, we easily circumvent this problem
because we assume that mutual funds manage the market portfolio. Indeed, they are of
no economic importance given the property of (expected) zero-profits as a by-product of
entrepreneurs' optimizing problem, which we discussed in the previous section. Because
of the non-state contingency we have introduced, ex post losses can occur that cannot
be diversified away. We simply assume that these losses are redistributed to the bond
holders via a reduced pay-off.
2.6.2 Banking sector
Since households cannot provide funds to the entrepreneurial sector directly, we introduce
a banking sector, which is basically lent on Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) and Gertler
and Karadi (2011). Our economy is populated by a continuum of lending banks n with
n  [0, 1]. In addition to loans the lending banks can grant to type B entrepreneurs
directly, they also buy (corporate) bonds issued by type A entrepreneurs.28 In addition,
each lending bank buys government bonds. Hence, each n-th lending bank holds three
assets and the total assets AB
n,t
evolves as
AB
n,t
= Ln,t
+ QB,corp
t
Bcorp
n,t
+ QB,gov
t
Bgov
n,t
. (25)
Following the arguments outlined in the previous sections, the loan rate rL
t
is negotiated
before the shocks are realized such that it becomes non-state contingent. As a result,
ex post defaults can occur, which must be borne by the lending bank. In the corporate
bond market, unexpected losses materialize in the ex post period return rB,corp
t
as a result
of unexpected changes in the price of the corporate bonds (see again Equation (20)).
Government bonds have a return of rB,gov
t
. The return on total assets before losses on
loans results as

Goodfriend and McCallum (2007) argue that the production of loans can be associated
with costs that result from monitoring. Although monitoring costs are already taken into
28Notice that they do not buy bonds directly from type A entrepreneurs. More precisely, they buy
bonds from mutual funds which in turn hold bonds issued by type A entrepreneurs. For the sake of
simplicity, we argue that lending banks buy bonds from entrepreneurs but technically the funds are
intermediated by mutual funds.

account through the BGG approach, giving loans to the non-financial sectors might be
associated with sales costs.29 Consequently, we attribute costs L

This formulation is similar to Kirchner and van Wijnbergen (2012), who attribute costs
to holdings of securities. However, we define the costs in shares and not in deviations from
a desired level.30 Looking at funding, the bank borrows from households at the rate rD
t
.31
In addition to debt, the lending bank can build up inside equity EI

by retaining
earnings. Thus, the balance sheet constraint becomes

Taking all costs together, the overall costs arise as n,t

. Regarding
the costs the lending banks have to bear, we follow Kirchner and van Wijnbergen (2012)
and express the costs in terms of inside equity. With this information at hand, we can
define the law of motion for inside equity that is written in real terms, while financial
assets are denominated in nominal terms

Here, we deviate from Gertler and Karadi (2011) who discuss real assets.32 The term
EI,gov
n,t
in Equations (30) and (31) captures capital injections by a public agent, while
n,t
comprises losses from the loan portfolio and costs for equity injections, i.e. t
=

, where we assume that banks have to pay the risk-free rate for equity
injections. Equation (31) simplifies Equation (30) by summarizing all assets AB
n,t
and
liabilities Dn,t
in conjunction with the corresponding gross rates RA
t
and RD
t
.
In the setting described by Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) or Gertler and Karadi (2011),
29A similar argument is also taken into account by Cúrdia and Woodford (2011).
30This approach prevents corner solutions and preserves determinacy.
31Because of the formulation of the bank, these loans comprise both deposits and bank bonds. From
this point of view, the interest rate is an "average" rate on bank's debt.
32In this context, they consider real bonds which are completely hedged against inflation.
17
the lending banks maximize the present value of their net worth, i.e. the value of the
bank Vn,t
, i.e. the discounted sum of retained earnings (inside equity in our model). In
our case, the bank managers would choose Ln,t

(32)
As explained in Section 2.1, a fraction sBM of household members becomes bank man-
agers. While they operate a lending bank, they accumulate wealth by retaining earnings.
However, it is not guaranteed that they will remain bank managers forever; the probabil-
ity of being a bank manager is pBM . Only when bank managers leave the lending bank do
they transfer the rest of their wealth back to the households. Thus, the term 1 - pBM
in Equation (32) reflects this transfer, while t,t+1
is the bank specific discount factor
which is households' pricing kernel  t+1
t
.
In section 2.5, we have already described the agency problem between the real sector
and the financial sector. In Gertler and Karadi (2011), this relationship is completely free
from financial frictions. However, there are financial frictions between the banks and their
creditors in their model. We additionally adapt this approach and consequently introduce
two different channels of financial frictions because of two-sided financial contracting: be-
tween the real sector and the financial sector and between the banks and their creditors.33
With respect to the former, we utilize a costly state verification problem in the vein of
BGG, as already outlined. In the latter case, we lean on Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010)
and assume that bank managers can divert part of the bank's resources and redistribute
the money back to households rather than paying it back to creditors. Like Rannenberg
(2013), we combine a BGG-type problem with a GK-type problem.34 An advantage of this
approach is that we are able to investigate the different frictions separately by abstracting
from a risky bank environment.35
GK-type financial frictions aim at a moral hazard/costly enforcement problem between
borrowers and lenders. The borrower, i.e. the bank, is not willing to meet its obligations
completely in each period. If the borrower unilaterally reduces its pay-off and does not
discharge all payment obligations, the lender can initiate bankruptcy proceedings against
the borrower. However, the fraction IC of available funds that may have been diverted
cannot be recovered because of high enforcement costs. Hence, the lenders only retrieve
the fraction 1 - IC of available funds. As a result, the lenders will only give funds to
the bank if the value of the bank is sufficient to guarantee the repayment of funds net of
diversion. Thus, the incentive constraint of the lenders becomes
Vn,t
ICAB
n,t
. (33)
The left-hand side of Equation (33) is net worth (discounted sum of expected inside equity)
as defined in Equation (32), while the right-hand side comprises the amount of diversion.
33This setting is basically similar to Hirakata et al. (2013), Meh and Moran (2010), Sandri and Valencia
(2013), and Zeng (2013).
34Looking at the financial sector, the main difference between the model in Rannenberg (2013) and
ours is that we allow for the bank to have a more sophisticated balance sheet.
35The treatment of risky banks would require either an insurance mechanism or the need to deal with
bank runs.
18
Thus, Equation (32) is maximized subject to Equation (33).
Regarding the optimization problem, we follow Kirchner and van Wijnbergen (2012)
and assume that it can be divided into one main problem and one sub-problem. At the
first level, the bank managers decide on total assets, while portfolio managers decide on
the composition of the assets at the second level.
Bank managers In order to solve the optimization problem at the first stage, we
follow Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) and obtain an expression for the value function that
is linear in quantities.

and are able to find an economic interpretation for the first order conditions.36 Equation
(37) is the expected discounted marginal return of one additional unit of assets, while
Equation (38) represents the expected discounted marginal costs of one additional unit
of external funds. Equation (39) gives the expected discounted marginal costs of holding
entrepreneurial and government bonds. The variable IE,gov
n,t
in Equation (40) is the ex-
pected discounted gain from an additional unit of external capital injections conducted by
a government institution, i.e. the gain from the recapitalization of the bank. As explained
above, the bank can suffer losses from its holdings of assets and potentially has to pay for
the capital injections; the term A
n,t
in Equation (41) reflects these facts and represents
the expected discounted costs.
36Derivations can be found in the appendix.
19
Consequently, Equation (35) states that the net marginal profits on one additional
unit of assets must be equal to the costs related to diversion. The variable IC
t
is the
Lagrange multiplier and signifies how much the incentive constraint binds. The second
first order condition, as presented in Equation (36), says that the gain from extending the
balance sheet must be greater than or equal to the additional incentive to divert. It holds
with equality if the shadow price of the incentive constraint is positive.37 By combining
both first order conditions, total assets can be expressed as a function of inside equity
by taking government's recapitalization and losses from the loan portfolio into account
(Equation (43)).

As opposed to Gertler and Karadi (2011), for instance, the variable IE
n,t
is not the
leverage ratio in our model; rather it is a gross leverage ratio before taking government
interventions and losses into account.
Portfolio managers After having determined total assets, portfolio managers de-
cide on the composition of assets. To find the optimal values, the law of motion for inside
equity can be rewritten with the help of the definitions outlined above.

(46)
In Equation (46), the value for inside equity available in period t+1 is expressed in terms
of total assets and inside equity. Since portfolio managers have the same objective as bank
managers, the optimization problem is aimed at maximizing inside equity. The difference
is that bank managers evaluate the present and the future, from which the total asset
position results, while portfolio managers optimize each period given total assets. Thus,
portfolio managers choose B,corp
n,t
and B,gov
n,t
optimally. From the maximization problem,
we obtain first order conditions that can be rewritten such that

arise. From Equation (47) it is clear that there is a positive relationship between the
spread between the expected return of corporate bonds and the loan rate and the share of
corporate bonds corrected by the share of loans. All else being equal, an increase in the
spread between the expected rate of return on corporate bonds and the loan rate raises
the share of corporate bonds in banks' assets. A similar relationship exists for the spread
between the loan rate and the expected return on government bonds. If loans earn more
money than government bonds per unit of leverage, the loan position is increased.
Aggregation By starting with the link between inside equity and the sum of assets
(Equation (43)), we can rewrite this expression to obtain

As one can see in Equation (49), the leverage ratio IE
n,t
is equal to all individuals if the
terms IE,gov
n,t
AB
n,t
and A
n,t
AB
n,t
are identical to all lending banks. One necessary condition for this
to hold is that the Lagrangian multiplier for the enforcement constraint is identical across
all individuals which is the case as long as the assets can be completely diverted to the
same extent across individuals, as one can see in Equation (35). Departing from Equations
(40) and (41), it is easy to show by forward iteration and the validity of the transversality
condition that the two terms are (nearly) identical to all individuals in the neighborhood
of the steady state, i.e. as long as the sum of assets does not vary to much.38 Thus, we
can drop the indexes in Equation (49).
Knowing that the leverage ratio AB
t
EI
t
is identical to all lending banks, we see from the
first order conditions resulting from portfolio managers' maximization problem that the
share of loans depends solely on the spread between the loan rate and the expected return
on government bonds and is consequently identical to all individuals. Knowing the share
of loans in banks' portfolio, it can be shown with the help of Equation (47) that the
share of corporate bonds is also free from individual characteristics. Hence, the portfolio
composition is the same across all lending banks. Thus, aggregation of quantities across
the individuals can simply be conducted by integration.

Regarding inside equity, the aggregate amount can be split up. Since a fraction of bank
managers resign, bank managers continue to operate a lending bank with probability pBM .
While the exiting bank managers' inside equity is no longer available, the remaining inside
equity is a fraction of aggregate inside equity
EI,old
t
= pBM EI
t
.
38This is a conventional assumption particularly in models that work with collateral constraints, see
Iacoviello (2005), for instance.
21
New bank managers fill the gap created by the exit of old bank managers and enter the
market in order to start operating a lending bank. From their households they obtain an
endowment with which inside equity is built up

2.7 Public sector
2.7.1 Fiscal authority
Having defined the private sector, we come to the description of the public sector, which
consists of a fiscal agent, the central bank, and an intervention authority. The author-
ities of the public sector do not face an optimization problem. To finance government
expenditures Gt
, the fiscal authority uses internal funds, i.e. from tax revenues (Tt
) and
profits received from the intervention authority PIA
t
, and external funds, i.e. from
the issuance of short-term Bshort,gov
t
and long-term government bonds Bgov
t
in the capital
market traded at price QB,gov
t
. Short-term government bonds are in zero net supply. The
budget constraint of the fiscal agent is given in Equation (50).

(50)
Tax revenues stem from labor income such that we have Tt
= w
t
wt
Nt
with w
t
as the
tax rate. Our fiscal agent adjusts the tax rate on labor income in order to stabilize the
level of real government debt, where the term BG is a positive number which reflects the
fact that governments' insolvency is ruled out by conducting a passive fiscal policy (see,
for example, Leeper, 1991). The tax rule is presented in Equation (51).

- w = w w

(51)
Furthermore, the fiscal agent aims to effect smooth changes in the tax rate (with au-
toregressive parameter w). To complete the fiscal authority, we specify government
expenditures as a fixed proportion of output.
22
2.7.2 Central bank
The central bank conducts monetary policy by controlling the policy rate iPR
t
.39 For this
purpose, it obeys a Taylor (1993)-type monetary policy rule, the objective of which is to
set the policy rate according to
1 + iPR
t
= 1 + iPR
t-1
smooth
(1 + i)(1-smooth) t

(1-smooth) Yt
Yt-1
y(1-smooth)
i
t
.
(52)
As can be seen in Equation (52), the central bank applies interest rate smoothing,
with smoothing parameter smooth. Since the economy possesses a non-zero steady state
rate of inflation, the central bank's main interest lies in keeping the distance between the
rate of inflation and the target rate of inflation () close to zero. In addition, the last
period's real output growth also affects the policy rate. The term  is the weight given
to inflation and y to output growth. Furthermore, the term i
t
represents an unexpected
monetary policy shock.
2.7.3 Intervention authority
In order to investigate crisis resolution policies, we introduce an intervention authority
that is assigned to the public sector. It has full credibility and is able to issue risk-less
short-term debt. The reason why we introduce an intervention authority is that we want
to sever the direct link to taxes on the one hand and do not want to assign the policies
solely to the central bank on the other hand.40 In the end, the balance sheet of the
intervention authority feeds into the public sector's balance sheet.
Regarding crisis resolution policies, we allow the intervention authority to conduct
outright purchases of corporate bonds Bcorp,IA
t
and of government bonds Bgov,IA
t
. As
interventions rules, we have
Bcorp,IA
t
= corp,IA xcorp
t-l
- xcorp (53)
for corporate bonds and
Bcorp,IA
t
= gov,IA xgov
t-l
- xgov , (54)
for government bonds, respectively. A similar rule can also be established for the recapi-
talization of the bank
EI,IA
t
= EI,IA xEI
t-l
- xEI . (55)
The terms corp,IA, gov,IA, and EI,IA reflect sensitivity parameters and xt
denotes a stress
indicator for the corresponding asset.
39The policy rate is the risk-free rate.
40Although outright asset purchases are usually conducted by central banks, recapitalization of banks
is sometimes undertaken by authorities with government guarantees. The latter are endowed with their
own resources and operate in the capital market on their own. Profits can be redistributed to the
fiscal authority or, in appropriate circumstances, losses are balanced by the fiscal authority. Smets and
Trabandt (2012) also sever the link between central bank profits and the government. In their model,
transfers from the central bank to the government depend on a rule which is directed to central bank's
holdings of government bonds. From this point of view, our approach is quite similar to theirs.
23
With the help of this knowledge, we can formulate the resource constraint of the
intervention authority which is given in Equation (56)

3 Calibration and steady state
In this section, we discuss the parameterization of the model and the steady state values.
Our calibration is chosen to reflect the euro area as a whole. The parameterization for the
real and the policy sector can be found in Table 1, while Table 2 provides the values for the
financial sector. Table 3 presents the steady state values of the model (in the right-hand
column) in conjunction with the average data for the euro area for the corresponding
variable. The entire model is calibrated quarterly.
41For technical reasons, as for corporate bonds, we need an aggregator that guarantees the same pay-off
per unit of loans.
24
Most of the parameters concerning the standard block in our DNK model are based
on the estimates for the euro area obtained by Smets and Wouters (2003), Christoffel,
Coenen, and Warne (2008), and Amisano and Tristani (2010). We set the inverse Frisch
elasticity, , to 2.5. The curvature on utility of consumption, , is set to 1.4 and the
parameter for habit formation in consumption, hC, has the value of 0.6. We assume
that households are able to renegotiate their wage with a probability of 0.24, from which
follows that w is 0.76. Lagged inflation enters with a weight (w) of 0.75 in the indexation
rule for non-optimizing wages. All these parameter values stem from Smets and Wouters
(2003). The wage elasticity in the labor aggregator, w, equals 6 and is similar to Gerali,
Neri, Sessa, and Signoretti (2010). The steady state value for hours worked is 0.33 of the
total hours available.

The capital share in production, , is calibrated to 0.3, which is standard. Since
we have introduced two different types of capital for use in production, we need the
corresponding weights. Through the weight, ws, the relative share of loans to bonds is
determined accordingly. To match the properties of the euro area in the steady state
(loan-to-bond ratio: 9.9), we set ws to 0.07 so that the steady state loan-to-bond ratio
in our model becomes 9.76.42 Concerning the rate of depreciation, , we attribute to both
42The data reflect the sector of non-financial corporations and stem from the integrated euro area
25
sectors the conventional value of 0.025. For our parameter for adjustment costs in the
capital stock, we once again make use of the estimate in Smets and Wouters (2003). The
term  has the value of 6.9 in both sectors. Our parameter for the costs resulting from
variations in the capital utilization, , is set to 0.15 in both sectors, which is between the
values provided by Smets and Wouters (2003) and Christoffel et al. (2008). In line with
both references, we base the probability that goods producers cannot reoptimize their
prices, , on their estimate of 0.9. Using the same source, we set the share of lagged
inflation in the indexation rule for prices, , to 0.45. Following the estimates of Amisano
and Tristani (2010), the price elasticity in final goods production, , has the value of
6.5, which is between the values for their non-linear model (6.373) and for their linear
model (6.914). As a result of our calibration exercise, the value of the scaling parameter
for disutility of labor in households' utility,  , as well as the fixed costs in intermediate
goods production, , are pinned down by the steady state.

After having calibrated the intermediate and final goods producing sector, we turn to
the entrepreneurs. Since we have two different sectors, we decide to attribute different
risk parameters to them. As in BGG, we assume that the share of realized profits lost in
the case of a default is 0.12 for the type A entrepreneurs, which is a conventional assump-
tion (see, for example, Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno, 2003; Gertler, Gilchrist, and
Natalucci, 2007). For the type B entrepreneurs, we follow the argument that monitoring
is more costly compared to market financing which feeds into a value for µB of 0.22. This
is quite close to the value that is estimated for the euro area by von Heideken (2009) but
guarantees that the transfer from households to entrepreneurs is a positive number. To
set the business failure rate F(), we take an average value of bankruptcy rates in the
euro area of 0.008.43 We use this value for both sectors. By contrast, we set two different
variances for the log of the idiosyncratic productivity variable, log(); for the type A
accounts.
43The data stem from different publications by the company Creditreform.
26
entrepreneurial sector it is 0.05 and 0.09 for the type B entrepreneurs. With these values
we are very close to the euro area's value in Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2010). In
line with the latter, we assume that the survival probability of entrepreneurs, pf , is 0.978
in both sectors.
With this calibration we get a debt-to-output ratio in the real economy of 3.59, which
is very close to the euro area figure (3.58). The same is true of the sectoral ratios. While
the loan-to-output ratio in the steady state of our model is 3.25, it is 3.12 in the euro
area. Regarding the (corporate) bonds-to-output ratio, we observe a ratio of 0.31 for the
euro area, whereas our model yields 0.33 in the steady state. Our debt-to-equity ratio
(loans plus bonds to both types of entrepreneurs' net worth) amounts to 0.83, which is
slightly higher than the historical average value, which equals 0.7 for the euro area.44
In our model, we allow for a specific maturity structure for corporate bonds. The
average maturity of corporate bonds in the euro area between 1999 and 2007 is about
6.5 years.45 As a consequence, we set the parameter B to a value of 0.971, which yields
an average maturity of 6.5 years. Our model is able to distinguish between risky and
risk-free spreads.46 The spread between the risk-free bond rate and the risk-free rate can
be interpreted as the difference in the yields on corporate bonds with the highest cred-
itworthiness, those of AAA rated issuers, and government bonds. Among other factors,
liquidity premiums can be seen as driving this spread (Longstaff, Mithal, and Neis, 2005).
Although we do not explicitly incorporate liquidity issues in our model, liquidity premi-
ums might result from limits to arbitrage. Limits to arbitrage arise in our model because
of portfolio costs. From this point of view, we calibrate the spread between the risk-free
bond rate and the risk-free rate according to the difference between yields on AAA rated
corporate bonds in the euro area and German government bonds with a maturity of 5 to
7 years, which is 25 basis points.47
The calibration of the risk-free loan rate rL is more difficult because credit conditions
are reported without classifying creditworthiness. Furthermore, the period for which
conditions are fixed cannot be directly compared to the maturity. As a solution, we
compute the volume-weighted loan rate based on the annualized rates agreed for new
businesses as reported in the ECB's MIR statistics, and establish the spread to the risk
and maturity weighted yield of non-financial corporations. In the pre-crisis period, we
obtain a value of roughly 7 basis points, which we extrapolate by adding it to the risk-free
bond rate to obtain the risk-free loan rate.48
The calibration of the risk-free rates together with the calibration of the risk param-
eters in the BGG partly pin down the steady state values for the remaining spreads.
44By using similar data, De Fiore and Uhlig (2011) report a value of 0.64, which is slightly below our
historical values because we also include more recent data.
45We obtain this number by analyzing all corporate bonds issued between 1999 and 2007 in euro area
member countries. The maturities are weighted by the amount issued. Similar values are reported in
European Central Bank (2012).
46Recall that the asset specific risk-free rates deviate from the risk-free rate because of limits to ar-
bitrage. Hence, the asset specific risk-free rates exceed the risk-free rate in the steady state because of
portfolio costs for both the lending banks and households.
47AAA rated bonds nevertheless convey a default risk. However, we believe that our proceeding is an
adequate way to calibrate the model. Yields on German government bonds are taken because they have
a high degree of liquidity and the highest credit rating throughout the period.
48For the euro area, De Fiore and Uhlig (2011) report bond spreads that exceed loan spreads. Our
calculations of spreads with different maturities and risk attitudes do not support their findings.

entrepreneurs and the second for type B entrepreneurs. Total assets as implied by the model are denoted by AB.
Following Bernanke et al. (1999), the credit spread can be defined as the difference be-
tween the risky-bond rate ZA and the risk-free bond rate. Our calibration exercise yields
a value of 0.59, which is equal to the spread between the yields of BBB and AAA rated
corporate bonds with a maturity of 5 to 7 years. Analogously, the spread between yields
on BBB rated corporate bonds and German government bonds with a maturity of 5 to 7
years, which is 0.84, corresponds to the spread of the pre-crisis period.
Based upon the OECD central government debt statistics, the average maturity of
government bonds in the euro area is slightly below 6 years. Consequently, we set the
parameter B,gov, which controls the maturity in our model, to 0.967. In line with this
maturity, we calibrate the quarterly discount factor of households, , to 0.9953, which
corresponds to an annual risk-free rate of 3.7%. The latter is the average yield on German
government bonds in the pre-crisis period. In setting the survival rate of bank managers
operating a lending bank we depart slightly from Gertler and Karadi (2011) and assume
that bankers operate a bank for 10 years and exit thereafter, i.e. the survival rate is 0.975.
Based again on banks' aggregate balance sheet, 13% of banks' total assets are allotted
to government bonds. The leverage ratio is set to 6, which corresponds to the value in
Gertler and Karadi (2013).
Summing up, our calibrated values are mostly in line with historical averages for the
euro area. However, the size of the banking system relative to output in our model is well
28
below the reality. While the ratio of total assets to GDP is 12 (or approximately 3 on an
annual basis) in the euro area, the corresponding number in our model is 4.12 (or 1.03 on
an annual basis). This remarkable difference might result from the fact that total assets
in our model are determined by the calibration exercise regarding the entrepreneurs. We
have therefore neglected several assets on banks' balance sheets. Nevertheless, the values
for the steady state of the real sector and some of those for the financial sector fit quite
well.
Next, we discuss the policy parameters. Our monetary authority puts a weight of
1.7 on the inflation objective, 
, and a weight of 0.1 on changes in real production,
y
. The autoregressive parameter in the Taylor rule, i
, is 0.8. Our economy exhibits
a non-zero steady state rate of inflation, s
, of 0.45 per cent on a quarterly base, which
results in an annual value of 1.8 per cent and is close to but below the ECB's target rate.
Government's indebtedness is set to 70% of GDP, from which a tax rate in the steady
state of 0.29 results. Regarding the tax rate, the fiscal agent reacts with a sensitivity of
0.01 (BG) to changes in government debt.49 This value guarantees fiscal solvency and it
is set to the lower bound at which the model becomes unstable.

Before we complete the description of the calibration exercise and the steady state
values, we present selected second moments for key variables by activating a monetary
policy, a technology shock, and an aggregate risk shock. The standard deviation of the
monetary policy shock is 0.0011, and 0.0185 for the productivity shock. For the risk
shock, we choose a standard deviation of 0.041 which stems from Christiano et al. (2014).
The simulated standard deviation of annual output growth in our model matches the
euro area average from 1999 to 2007, while the standard deviation for investment growth
with a value of 3.32 only differs slightly from the euro area's average (3.14). Regarding
the correlation coefficient between output growth and investment growth, we are close
to its historical average. The same is also true of the correlation between annual output
growth and the rate of inflation. A further central variable in our model is banks' leverage
ratio, which shows a historical average of 0.47 between 1999 and 2007. The value implied
by our model is quite far away from this number; however, it is positive in contrast to
the Gertler and Karadi (2011) setting. Although the correlation coefficient between the
leverage ratio and output growth implied by our model deviates from its historical average,
its sign corresponds with reality.
Overall, our model is very good at replicating some features of real data.
49Following Leeper (1991), monetary policy is active, while fiscal policy takes a passive stance.

4 Evaluating policy measures for mitigating a financial
crisis
In this section, we evaluate policy measures that are aimed at mitigating financial stress,
in other words we discuss outright purchases of assets and capital injections into the
banking sector. Concretely, we relate the amount of purchases or of equity injections to
the magnitude of financial stress. Before turning to the evaluation, we will discuss sources
of financial stress because our model is able to distinguish between two different origins.
4.1 Simulating financial stress
Our first financial shock is fundamentally similar to the capital quality shock in Gertler
and Karadi (2011).50 We draw on the "risk shock" stemming from the BGG part of
the model, which is aimed at the variance of entrepreneurs' productivity shock e
t
(see
Christiano et al., 2014, for example). Hence, we increase entrepreneurial risk, which
raises bankruptcies. From this point of view, it is a shock that stems from the real
sector, namely the entrepreneurial sector, and impacts on the financing conditions of non-
financial enterprises. Because of the setup, the shock can be seen as financial stress in
a perfectly diversified economy. Defaults are reflected in monitoring costs, which drives
borrowing costs upwards; however, lenders' investment decisions depend solely on risk-free
rates because risk can be diversified completely. Christiano et al. (2014) see this shock as
being very important for the business cycle.
To obtain our second financial shock, we adapt the idea behind the capital quality
shock to induce stress into the banking sector. However, we aim to focus on developments
that originate in the banking sector and then spill over to the real sector rather than
occurring simultaneously in both sectors. To this end, we induce a shock on banks'
returns (Equation 26),

with rA as an autoregressive parameter and the

. The shock drives the return on assets downwards and affects banks'
profits directly. From this point of view, the shock can be interpreted as losses from an
undiversified portfolio because creditors can recover fewer assets. In terms of interpre-
tation, it comes close to a pure loan supply shock (Peek, Rosengren, and Tootell, 2003;
Gilchrist and Zakrajsek, 2012).
In order to highlight the differences in the results of the two sources of financial stress,
we compare the dynamics of relevant variables in response to these shocks. In doing so,
we calibrate the return shock in such a way that investment behaves identically during the
50Regarding the simulation of a financial crisis, we depart from Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) or Gertler
and Karadi (2011). In their models, financial stress is induced by shocking the quality of capital, which
has two consequences: it directly reduces the value of banks' assets and as a consequence their net worth,
and it causes production to drop (with further consequences for the real economy and, therefore, for
banks' balance sheets).

first year after the shock and achieves the same minimum value, which is then roughly also
true of output. This is happening while the aggregate credit premium responds identically
in both cases. As can be seen in Figure 1, both shocks cause a recession, mainly driven
by a drop in investment which coincides with a lower rate of inflation. The bank profit
shock is given by the solid black lines and the dynamics resulting from the risk shock are
given by the dashed blue lines. A first obvious result is that the effect of the profit shock
on the real economy is more persistent than that of the risk shock, although the response
of investment in the first year is the same.
A major difference occurs with respect to interest rate spreads, i.e. risk-free spreads
as the difference between the asset specific risk-free rate and the policy rate, and credit
spreads as the difference between the expected return on capital and the asset specific
risk-free rate. While both risk-free spreads rise after the risk shock, credit spreads remain
virtually constant (with a slight tendency to decrease in the corporate bond sector) after
the profit shock. Here, the different nature of the shocks is evident. Since the profit
shock depresses banks' equity position, lending to the non-financial sector shrinks and
an excess demand for credit emerges. The rise in risk-free rates, which is even stronger
than the increase in the policy rate, contributes to a fall in investment. As a result,
31
the profit shock raises mainly the risk-free spreads rather than credit spreads. For the
risk shock, the situation is different. Entrepreneurial risk increases, which is why credit
spreads rise predominantly. The fact that the pattern for premiums is similar in both
cases is because entrepreneurs reduce their demand for capital, which causes the price of
capital to drop. A lower capital price reduces entrepreneurs' net worth. However, the
aggregate credit premium (the capital weighted spreads between the expected returns on
capital and the risk-free rate), which includes both components, behave similarly. An
important distinction arises regarding banks' leverage ratio. While the leverage ratio falls
for the risk shock, it increases for the profit shock on impact.
Comparing the two different financial shocks, we see that the combination of financial
frictions between non-financial corporations and financial intermediaries with financial
frictions between financial intermediaries, namely banks, and their creditors produces
different dynamics in terms of spreads. Our modelling approach regarding the combination
of the BGG framework with the GK framework is appealing since we are able to compare
a financial shock in a completely diversified economy (risk shock) with a financial shock
in an economy in which the banking sector is not working efficiently (profit shock) and
can evaluate the driving forces. This allows us to scrutinize the adequacy of our policy
measures, which we do in the next section.
4.2 Policy instruments
4.2.1 Asset purchases
During the financial crisis, various financial assistance programs were introduced to pre-
vent the economy from slowing down and to support the recovery. On the one hand,
assets were purchased outright. The ideas behind asset purchase programs can be mani-
fold (see, for example, Brett and Neely, 2013). During the financial crisis, some segments
of the financial market were malfunctioning; extraordinary price dispersion could not be
removed by market forces. Purchase programs were therefore intended to remove these
obstacles. Outright purchases by governments have the same fundamental objective as
purchases of private assets, but also aim at reducing borrowing costs by influencing the
benchmark risk-free rate. Where the policy rate set by central banks reaches the zero
lower bound, asset purchases can therefore be used to influence longer-term borrowing
conditions. In general, a necessary condition for asset purchases to be effective is that
the Wallace Irrelevance proposition of full arbitrage does not hold, i.e. limits to arbitrage
exist (Chen et al., 2012; Christiano and Ikeda, 2013a; Cúrdia and Woodford, 2011; Eg-
gertsson and Woodford, 2003). Hence, the main channel by which asset purchases work
is by influencing the relative price of assets (Andrés, López-Salido, and Nelson, 2004).
Limits to arbitrage also exist for the assets under consideration in our model, i.e. cor-
porate and government bonds.51 However, we concentrate only on those cases in which
unconventional measures can be used to mitigate tensions on the financial market and do
not treat the case of an instrument in a zero-lower-bound environment. As known from
the previous section, the policy rate is reduced as a response to the drop in inflation.
From this point of view, our policy measures constitute additional policy tools.
51Limits to arbitrage are introduced in our model by allowing for segmented capital markets. Because
of transaction costs, portfolio adjustment or portfolio costs, and financial frictions in the banking sector,

Note: see note for Figure 1. The aggregate credit premium is the capital-weighted average of the spread between the return
on capital and the policy rate in the two sectors. Entrepreneurial net worth is the capital-weighted entrepreneurial net
worth of the two sectors.
In order to relate asset purchases to financial conditions, as done by Gertler and
Karadi (2011), for instance, we draw on the policy rules as presented in Equations (53)
and (54), which link the volume of purchases to a specific crisis indicator. Usually the
credit spread, as defined by the difference between the return on capital and the risk-
free rate, is a reliable crisis indicator. However, our model is rich in different sorts of
crisis indicators. To calculate the above-mentioned credit spread, we have two options:
to calculate it with the asset specific risk-free rate (as done in Figure 1) or with the help
of the policy rate. Alternatively, we could use the external finance premium as defined
by Bernanke et al. (1999) or the spread between the risky rates (Ze
t
) and a risk-free rate.
Since our model features two different sources of financial frictions, the spread between
the expected rate of capital and the policy rate comprises distortions from both frictions.
However, we need to choose the sector because every indicator appears in each sector. We
opt to link the volume of purchases to the capital-weighted average of the spread between
the return on capital and the policy rate. From this point of view, we keep close to the
literature.
In Figure 2, we depict the effects of asset purchases conducted by the intervention
authority in response to the risk shock. The black solid line represents what happens
differences in returns cannot be removed completely by the households (see Andrés et al. (2004)).
33
where there is no policy response, i.e. the pure shock, while the blue dashed lines represent
the dynamics resulting from the purchases of corporate bonds and the dashed red lines
with dots the dynamics as a result of buying government bonds.
Both policy measures show the same qualitative and quantitative responses for most
variables. Bond purchases by the intervention authority increase the price of this asset
class, which is why the return on the respective bond falls. A standard story is that
loans and other assets now appear more attractive to the bank, which means that the
bank should buy the other bonds and grant more loans to the private sector (see, for
example, Gertler and Karadi, 2013). However, this is only partly true in our model for
both purchases of corporate bonds and government bonds.
Purchases of corporate bonds reduce the (expected) return on corporate bonds, which
is why the corresponding risk-free spread shrinks and both banks and households reduce
their holdings of corporate bonds. Although funds are available to invest in other assets,
the reduction in returns lessens banks' profits and initiates a stronger reduction in inside
equity. As a consequence, banks' leverage ratio rises even more strongly that in the initial
shock scenario. As a result of the higher leverage ratio, the loan supply is even reduced
by the purchases rather than being stimulated. While there is only a marginal effect on
credit spreads, risk-free spreads are mainly reduced through the policy measures. Similar
effects also arise in the case of purchases of government bonds. Contrary to Gertler and
Karadi (2013), the net worth of banks, i.e. inside bank equity in our model, does not
improve. In our model, inside bank equity is depressed even further because asset returns
fall by more than the cost of liabilities. Because of the financial frictions between the
banking sector and its creditors, banks cut their balance sheets. Again, the reduction in
returns lowers banks' profits and increases the leverage ratio.
The effects of asset purchases in the case of the profit shock are fundamentally very
similar to those of the risk shock (see Figure 3). Again, outright purchases mainly reduce
credit spreads but risk-free spreads only slightly. From the reduction in risk-free spreads
a more persistent fall in inside equity results which drives banks' leverage ratio upwards.
This bank leverage effect impairs investment in the third year which is why output falls
short of its no policy trajectory at this time.
From the results derived in this subsection, outright purchases of government or cor-
porate bonds represent a policy tool in our model to mitigate financial stress regardless of
its source, i.e. whether stemming from the real economy or from the banking sector. In
our model, outright purchases conducted by a public agent, however, also weaken finan-
cial health of the bank because smaller asset returns reduce bank profits. From this point
of view, our channel is similar to the channel highlighted in Benes and Kumhof (2011)
who stress the role of returns for the build up of bank equity but contrary to Gertler and
Karadi (2013) who stress the asset price channel.
4.2.2 Equity injections
Equity injections into banks are the second type of policy measure that has been widely
used during the financial crisis to mitigate financial stress. A central problem during the
financial crisis was the erosion of banks' equity position, which has forced banks to delever.
Zeng (2013) shows that equity injections can have real effects in an economy with perfect
nominal flexibility. Similar results can also be obtained by applying different modelling

frameworks as done by Christiano and Ikeda (2013a), albeit without embedding them into
a general equilibrium macro model. Hirakata et al. (2013) and Sandri and Valencia (2013)
investigate equity injections in a general equilibrium model and stress their effectiveness
in the banking sector. A similar result can be obtained in a continous-time general
equilibrium model as developed by He and Krishnamurthy (2013). In this section, we
investigate the effects of equity injections into banks within our New Keynesian general
equilibrium model.
In Figures 4 and 5 the black lines represent the crisis situation without a policy re-
sponse, i.e. the cases of the risk shock and the profit shock, respectively. The dashed blue
lines show the effects of a moderate policy response in terms of resources used, while the
red dashed lines with dots reflect a stronger policy response.
As in the models designed by He and Krishnamurthy (2013), Hirakata et al. (2013), and
Sandri and Valencia (2013), direct equity injections also relax the borrowing constraint of
banks in our model because the amount of inside equity rises and reduces banks' leverage
(see Equation (36)). With the additional money that the bank receives, it expands its
balance sheet by lending more to entrepreneurs of type B and by buying more bonds
(corporate bonds and government bonds). Lower loan rates and bond returns stimulate
entrepreneurs' net worth and investment in physical capital by relaxing financial frictions.
Both credit spreads and risk-free spreads are lower compared to the no policy case in both
investment sectors. The drop in investment is attenuated and output shrinks by less,

which also takes downward pressure from inflation. However, consumption initially falls
by more but recovers faster because of wealth effects. Compared to the crisis situation,
lower (risk-free) bond returns cut profits, which is why households reduce both their
holdings of bonds and consumption even more.
For the profit shock, as presented in Figure 5, the effects are similar to the risk shock
case, again. The drop in investment is attenuated, which causes output to fall by less
compared to the no policy case. Differences occur with respect to the leverage ratio, the
initial effect of the shock has increased banks' leverage ratio, whereas the additional bank
equity reduces the leverage ratio.
As can be seen, an important advantage of injections of inside bank equity is that
financial frictions are alleviated (see Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) for the argument, for
instance). Equity injections into banks are a particularly suitable response to the bank-
specific shock because they neutralize the original consequences of the shock. Injections
of bank equity reduce banks' borrowing constraint at the same time as improving the real
sector's borrowing conditions for the bank-specific shock and seem to be more favorable
than asset purchases in this case. For the bank-specific shock, asset purchases reinforce
stress in the banking sector because of their consequences for bank equity. Since loans
dominate banks' portfolio, the effects of the stabilization of asset prices as a result of the
public purchases are outweighed by the effects in terms of returns on banks' profits.
In order to evaluate the differences among the measures, we need to look at indicators
which allow comparisons. In this respect, we also take the welfare perspective, which is

4.3 Evaluation of policy measures
There are two dimensions to evaluating policy measures. Firstly, we compare the quali-
tative effects of the responses across policy measures in more detail. For this purpose, we
look at the pure policy responses which are not linked to a specific crisis indicator. In this
connection, we also evaluate the effectiveness of measures by looking at the additional
output effects given specific resources used. Secondly, we take the welfare perspective to
complete the evaluation of measures' effectiveness.
4.3.1 Comparison of direct effects and effectiveness of policy measures
In Figure 6, the solid black lines represent the effects of an equity injection, while the blue
dashed line and the red dashed line with dots show the responses to corporate bond and
government bond purchases, respectively. For the asset purchases, we scale the initial
volume of purchases to the same level, which amounts to 5% of GDP. For the equity
injection case, the amount of interventions falls short of the other two cases. Here, we
calibrate the intervention volume such that the peak in the response to investment roughly
coincides with the peak for corporate bond purchases. Regarding the macroeconomic
variables, output, inflation, consumption, and investment, the effects following corporate

Note: The Figure presents the pure responses to equity injections and purchases of government and corporate bonds. See
also notes for Figures 1 and 2.
bond purchases are qualitatively nearly identical to the the impact of outright purchases
of government bonds. A comparison of purchases of bonds with equity injections yields
major differences. Aggregate investment is boosted on impact in all cases, which results
in an increase in output, but output falls below the no policy case following the second
year for bond purchases.
These qualitative differences can, in part, be traced back to developments in sectoral
investment, although aggregate investment responds equally on impact. As already de-
scribed, equity injections lower banks' leverage ratio, which has two effects: external
borrowing is facilitated because both financial frictions are relaxed and additional finan-
cial resources are directly available. Thus, the loan rate decreases slightly and stimulates
loan production. At the same time, corporate bond returns fall because of higher demand
for corporate bonds, which reduces borrowing costs in the bond sector and contributes to
the increase in investment in this sector.
As opposed to equity injections, investment in the bond sector is reduced in the case
of bond purchases. As mentioned above, lower corporate bond returns weaken banks'
balance sheet by increasing the leverage ratio. This effect is similar for government bond
purchases. The drop in bank equity resulting from the reduction in lending rates drives
banks' leverage ratio upwards. As a consequence, banks reduce their lending activities.
For the less financially constrained bond sector, this volume effect outweighs the improve-

ment in borrowing conditions.52 Because of the introduction of market-based debt, bond
prices also affect entrepreneurial net worth in this sector.53 Specifically, the support for
corporate bond prices from the introduction of the policy measures reduces entrepreneurial
net worth in the corporate bond sector and exerts upward pressure on the entrepreneurial
leverage ratio with consequences for the credit spread in this sector. Thus, investment
is reduced since banks need to adjust their asset holdings, while borrowing conditions
are driven by the exogenous public intervention. This interrelationship becomes clear
when the responses in terms of banks' leverage ratio are compared with the responses
of bank equity, the price for corporate and government bonds, and aggregate lending to
entrepreneurs. Asset purchases only stabilize banks' balance sheet in the first periods
of the implementation of the policy. As public intermediation becomes weaker, bank
deleveraging even drives bond prices downwards.
Obviously, output does not improve persistently in the case of outright purchases.
When evaluating the effectiveness of measures, Figure 6 provides a first hint. While nearly
the same output response is achieved, much more resources are spent for the purchase
of bonds. In order to allow for qualitative comparisons among the measures, we use a
simple indicator, which is known from fiscal policy analysis. We compute the present value
multiplier over the first k quarters on the change in the macro variable Xt
in response
to the resources used for the corresponding policy measure PM. Similarly to Mountford
and Uhlig (2009), the present value multiplier is defined as
PV Mk
=
k
i
iXt+i
k
i
iPMt+i
.
We draw on the multipliers on output and (aggregate) investment and provide the
present value multiplier for the next year and the next two years for every policy measure
under consideration in Table 5.
52In a sense, this effect can be seen as a reflection of the different responses of more and less financially
constrained firms to monetary policy shocks, as discussed by Gertler and Gilchrist (1994). Gertler
and Gilchrist (1994) demonstrate that more financially constrained firms reduce bank borrowing after a
contractionary monetary policy shock, whereas this is not the case for less constrained firms.
53Kühl (2014) investigates the effects of bond prices and maturities in the BGG framework. He shows
that prolongation risk becomes apparent for longer maturities and can reverse the behavior of the external
finance premium because bond prices also affect entrepreneurial net worth.
39
In line with the visual inspection, all measures exhibit a positive multiplier on both
output and investment. However, the multiplier following equity injections is of a greater
size than those for both purchases. Purchases of bonds are successful regardless of whether
corporate or government bonds are purchased; the exact multipliers are even nearly iden-
tical for the specific cases. Regarding the qualitative responses, these results are broadly
in line with those obtained by Gertler and Karadi (2013), who combine government debt
with a state-contingent asset. Nevertheless, quantitative difference occur which can be
traced back to the introduction of non-market debt in our model. From this point of view,
equity injections are better suited to stabilize an economy since less resources are needed.
The special role of equity is mainly responsible for this result. As already stressed, equity
injections relax financial frictions in the banking sector by driving the leverage ratio down.
4.3.2 Welfare implications
The comparison of measures has drawn on the quantitative effects on investment and
output. However, the evaluation of different measures compared to a benchmark case
(the crisis situation) must be carried out under the welfare perspective to assess their
usefulness for the agents (following the arguments of Lucas (1987) in the sense of reducing
business cycle fluctuations). Thus, we ask which of the three proposed measures is welfare
improving and compare the welfare implications among the measures. Welfare will also
depend on the amount of resources used, which is why we compute welfare for a range of
resources used. Furthermore we depart slightly from a full-blown welfare analysis which
starts from specific shocks and investigates different policy rules under this environment.
Instead, we assume that a specific shock is known to the policy maker and he reacts with
one specific measure to this shock, i.e. there is full information. This means that we
treat the cases of both financial shocks separately and for each we shock calculate and
measure the consumption equivalent welfare gain by increasing the initial intervention
volume. Consumption equivalent welfare is calculated according to the approach discussed
in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007) based upon
E0

t=0
tu (Ct
, Nt
) = E0

t=0
tu (1 + c
t
) ¯
C, ¯
N ,
in which c
t
is the consumption equivalent that equates conditional welfare with the basic
scenario.
In Figure 7, we present consumption equivalent welfare gains by implementing the
policy measures following the risk shock. Figure 7 consists of two graphs: the left-hand
side shows welfare gains for a range of resources from zero to 0.15% of GDP. In this range,
equity injections following a risk shock first improve welfare before they start to lessen wel-
fare significantly. Both types of asset purchase have similar welfare implications. While
welfare remains nearly constant for smaller intervention volumes, with increasing inter-
vention volumes, which are presented in the right-hand graph, welfare increases steadily
and even exceeds the maximum achieved by capital injections. The reason why welfare
deteriorates for larger equity injections following the risk shock is that the initial shock
has already depressed asset returns and consumption, which is exacerbated by the policy
measure. Thus, equity injections in a case where financial stress does not stem from the

banking sector quickly lowers welfare if injections are too large. Up to first order, this is
because households receive lower returns from their asset holdings, this induces greater
business cycle fluctuations. Recall that a risk shock can be interpreted as a financial shock
in a completely diversified economy. As long as risk has not returned to its normal level,
outright asset purchases substitute private intermediation, reduce borrowing conditions,
and mitigate the original shock (see again Figure 6 for the bond sector).
For the profit shock, as given in Figure 8, the evaluation of policy measures is again
qualitatively similar for different ranges of intervention volume. Small amounts raised
for equity injections clearly improve welfare, but the effect is negative for larger volumes.
Again, asset purchases are welfare improving but equity injections are much more efficient
in terms of alleviating the implications of the profit shock on households' welfare. The
driving force behind this is a combination of different effects: risk-free returns shrink
less strongly and consumption falls more strongly but recovers faster. From this point of
view, equity injections improve welfare more efficiently in the case of a financial shock that
distorts the main financial intermediary in the economy. Much larger volumes of outright
purchases are needed to achieve the same welfare improvement. Nevertheless, excessively
large equity injections also reduce welfare because they start to induce additional volatility.
As can be seen from our welfare analysis, outright purchases are strictly welfare im-
proving for both types of shock, regardless of the resources used. However, the interven-
tions conducted by the public intervention authority might be linked to costs (see Gertler
and Kiyotaki, 2010). Dedola et al. (2013) and Gertler and Karadi (2011) use a quadratic
costs function to address the fact that outright purchases, by increasing the amount of
intervention, are not per se welfare enhancing. Since the effects of costs on welfare cru-
cially depend on the functional form of the cost function and its parameters, we decide
not to take account of these issues in our analysis. This does not mean that we deny that
public interventions raise costs.54 As can be seen in Figure 8, welfare improves with larger
54Moreover, in our model, the public sector balance sheet allows for stronger feedback effects as in
Dedola et al. (2013) or Gertler and Karadi (2011), because we have a profit/loss redistributing channel

outright purchases. However, welfare rises faster for smaller equity injections. As long
as the costs stemming from injections of equity into banks are not much greater than for
outright purchases in cases of smaller equity injections, the welfare improving effects will
remain. Moral hazard related to equity injections might be a factor that is not taken into
account in our model. Larger outright purchases will also induce costs, which will stop
the seemingly steady increase in welfare.
Our results are in line with recent work by He and Krishnamurthy (2013), though we
achieve our results within a New Keynesian model and carefully distinguish between the
sources of financial shocks.55 Nevertheless, the mechanism that drives our results is very
similar.
4.4 The impact of maturities
Since we have introduced average maturities in bond portfolios and different average
maturities might have an impact on the results, we shed more light on their effects. The
maturities in the main text were calibrated to reflect the corresponding euro area averages.
However, it is of interest to see whether the results presented above depend on the average
maturity.
In Figure 9, we compare the effects of the equity injections as presented in Figure 6,
i.e. where the corporate bond portfolio has an average maturity of 6.5 years (bold lines),
with those where we reduce the average maturity to one period (dashed blue lines). In
terms of the macroeconomic variables, the qualitative responses do not change overall,
although the quantitative results change slightly. Investment in the bond sector increases
by more in the short average maturity case, which means that the slight decrease in the
third year after implementation disappears. This result is related to the development of
entrepreneurs' leverage ratio in the bond sector, which translates into the corresponding
credit spread. As shown by Kühl (2014), developments in the corporate bond price
with feedback on taxes.
55The model of He and Krishnamurthy (2013) primarily works by affecting agents' risk sharing. Their
conclusion is nevertheless very similar to ours.

also affect entrepreneurial net worth, which is particularly relevant for longer average
maturities. Equity injections increase demand for bonds, causing prices to rise. This rise
in corporate bond prices reduces entrepreneurial net worth in the bond sector, stimulates
the credit spread and dampens the increase in investment in this sector. For shorter
average maturities, entrepreneurial leverage ratios move in parallel in both sectors. As a
consequence, aggregate investment, output and inflation rise more as a result of equity
injections into the banking sector.
As seen in Figure 6, purchases of corporate and government bonds produce nearly
identical responses in terms of the variables in which we are interested. For this reason,
we rely solely on corporate bond purchases and compare the effects for longer and shorter
average maturities (Figure 10). The qualitative responses of macroeconomic variables
change more strongly than for equity injections into the banking sector. However, the
differences in responses can be traced back to the same reasons as outlined for the equity
injection case. Purchases of corporate bonds directly increase bond prices. Again, higher
corporate bond prices tend to increase the entrepreneurial leverage ratio in the corporate
bond sector. For shorter average maturities, the leverage ratio for type A entrepreneurs
falls by more, meaning that the credit spread is also reduced by more, which stimulates
investment in this sector. Since there is no noticeable effect on banks' leverage ratio, the
behavior of investment in the bond sector shows the same pattern as for longer average

maturities, although an upward level shift takes place. Obviously, the volume effect as
a result of the increase in banks' leverage ratio is outweighed by the improvement in
borrowing conditions for this case. The slight change in investment and a more persistent
increase in consumption, due to wealth effects, prevents output from falling in the second
year after introducing the policy measure. At the same time, inflation is stimulated rather
than being depressed.
Obviously, shorter average maturities coincide with an increase in the output multi-
plier. In order to gauge the effects on output of changing the average maturity, we vary
the average maturity of corporate bonds on the x-axis in Figure 11 and compute, for each
value, the corresponding output multiplier. Taken together, the pattern is very similar
across the three measures. With longer average maturities, the multipliers shrink. How-
ever, the largest changes occur in the average maturity range of up to two years. For
longer maturities, the reduction is nearly negligible. From this point of view, different
average maturities do not affect the overall results.
4.5 The role of financial frictions
As mentioned, we calibrate our model to the euro area. In this respect, we are able to
replicate many features of the economic structure such as credit spreads or maturities

of corporate bonds or government bonds. However, parameters which control financial
frictions are set plausibly but without an empirical backing. In this section, we investigate
which factors might alter the general results obtained in the preceding sections.
Since limits to arbitrage are crucial for obtaining non-trivial effects of outright pur-
chases (Andrés et al., 2004), we focus on the factors that drive market segmentation in
our model. In bankers' incentive constraint (Equation (33)), we assumed that all as-
sets can be diverted equally. As in Gertler and Karadi (2013), we consequently assume
now that assets can be diverted to different degrees. In principle, it is conceivable that
money invested in the loan portfolio is easier to divert than money invested in bonds.
Bonds are traded on a market and the price is publicly available, which makes it easier
to monitor. By contrast, observation of the loan portfolio is usually exclusive to bankers.
Consequently, the incentive constraint can be rewritten as
Vn,t
IC LLn,t
+ B,BcorpQB,corp
t
Bcorp
n,t
+ B,govQB,gov
t
Bgov
n,t
, (59)
where the parameters L, B,Bcorp, and B,gov range between 0 and 1 and express the
percentage of money invested in the corresponding asset that can be diverted by bankers.
As a consequence, from the modified incentive constraint it follows that the first order
conditions, which are provided in the Appendix A.6, change.
In addition to the features that affect financial frictions in the banking sector, our
household sector also exhibits financial frictions arising from portfolio costs as presented
in Equation (7). These costs appear in the Euler equations and consequently affect the
pricing of the assets directly. Similar costs can also be found for the banks (see Equations
(27) and (28)). Unlike for households, these parameters are pinned down by the steady
state because they result from the calibrated yield spreads, which is why we mainly focus
on the other parameters controlling the frictions. Regardless of the considerations made
above, we vary the values of the parameters over a broad range. For every parameter
combination, we decide to report the present value multiplier on output.
In Figure 12, we provide the results for frictions that are related to corporate bonds

in the banking sector (x-axis) and to government bonds in the household sector (y-axis).
In terms of equity injections and purchases of government bonds, the qualitative effects
are very similar. Frictions in the banking sector do not matter much for effectiveness,
frictions in the household sector mainly affect the magnitude of the multiplier. The larger
portfolio costs for government bonds are, i.e. the greater market segmentation is, the
larger the multiplier is for equity injections, while it is the other way round for purchases
of government bonds. Frictions in the banking sector mainly matter for purchases of
corporate bonds. The more money can be diverted from holdings of corporate bonds,
the more effective corporate bond purchases are. With respect to frictions in the banking
sector, these results are in line with what is expected. A higher degree of friction fosters
limits to arbitrage and makes the proposed policy measures more effective. As a result,
the multiplier even moves into negative territory for smaller degrees of friction in the
banking sector in cases of corporate bond purchases because the effects on investment in
the bond sector are not strong enough.
Output multipliers resulting from equity injections are not mainly affected by frictions
with respect to government bonds in the banking sector. Again, frictions mainly matter
if they manifest themselves in the household sector (see Figure 13, household sector on
the y-axis and banking sector on the x-axis). Greater parameter values for portfolio costs
increase the multiplier. For purchases of both corporate bonds and government bonds,
the effects of frictions relating to government bonds in the banking sector are qualitatively
identical to the previous case. Output multipliers increase more strongly for government
bond purchases if banks divert more resources from holdings of government bonds.
In the last case, we again vary frictions in the household sector for government bonds
(y-axis) and the share of loans that can be diverted in the banking sector (x-axis) as
shown in Figure 14. Frictions in the banking sector mainly control the magnitude of
the multiplier for equity injections and asset purchases. However, a similar shape arises
for both asset purchases but with a reversed slope. The more money banks can divert

from the loan portfolio, the lower the multipliers are. As discussed in Section 4.3.1, asset
purchases alter the returns and lower banks' profits. If frictions in the loan sector increase,
the amplification mechanism is stronger and decreases output by more.

Summing up the results from this section: equity injections remain more effective
by looking at the present value multiplier on output regardless of the characteristics of
frictions. They do not turn into negative in the presented cases. The quantitative effects
of outright purchases, however, heavily depend on the magnitude of frictions.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the unconventional policy measures applied by central banks
and governments to fight the fallout from the financial crisis. We draw on a New Keynesian
stochastic general equilibrium model with a well-elaborated financial sector in which bank-
financed debt plays a major role. From this point of view, our model is able to imitate the
structure of the euro area to which we calibrate it. We combine an agency problem between
the banking sector and capital producers with a costly state verification problem between
the banking sector and non-financial corporations. As opposed to Hirakata et al. (2011),
Hirakata et al. (2013), and Sandri and Valencia (2013), our bank is not risky since it
cannot go bankrupt. Nevertheless, we allow for a loss distribution channel. An advantage
of our framework is that it abstracts from defaults in the banking sector. We modeled
two different sectors which allows us to distinguish between non-market-based debt, i.e.
loans, and market-based debt, i.e. corporate bonds that are traded on the capital market.
Furthermore, two sided financial contracting makes it possible to distinguish between two
different sources of financial stress, i.e. the riskiness of the entrepreneurial sector and an
exogenous drop in banks' net worth. This setting enabled us to investigate the effects of
unconventional measures, equity injections and outright purchases, on the real economy
and the financial sector. By using the same consistent framework, we were able to compare
the efficacy of different policy measures and even evaluate their feedback effects.
It turns out that injections of inside equity into banks seem to be more efficient in terms
of resources used. However, equity injections are welfare improving mainly if financial
stress stems from the banking sector. They tend to be efficient because the build-up of
inside equity relaxes banks' borrowing constraints and reduces borrowing conditions at
the same time. Our results are in line with those of Christiano and Ikeda (2013a) and
He and Krishnamurthy (2013), who utilize different frameworks. Outright purchases (of
corporate bonds or government bonds) also improve welfare but only by utilizing more
resources. They tend to reduce returns, which lowers banks' profits and weakens banks'
balance sheets. Since banks' balance sheets are dominated by loans rather than securities,
the price stabilizing role of asset purchases is of minor importance. From this point of
view, our results complement the results obtained in the literature, where traded assets
are accorded greater importance. If non-market-based debt dominates banks' balance
sheets, as in the case of the euro area, equity injections into the banking sector might
be more efficient if the financial shock originates in the banking sector. However, moral
hazard problems resulting from banks' inherent option of drawing on public resources in
cases of financial stress are not addressed in this paper.

A.6 Financial frictions in the banking sector
As a variation of the model in the main text, we allow for different degrees of asset
diversion. By making use of bank's balance sheet constraint, and of the definition for
B,corp
n,t
and B,gov
n,t
, we can rewrite the incentive constraint from Equation (33) and obtain
the expression
Vn,t

n,t
- B,gov
n,t
+ B,corpB,corp

. (82)
The parameters B,L, B,corp, and B,gov control the share that can be diverted from the
respective asset class. The optimization problem at the first stage remains the same and
the conjectured function does not change

Note: For both economic areas, the data stem from the corresponding flow of funds statistics. In
the case of the USA, foreign direct investment (FDI) ranks among the liabilities. For the sake of
comparability, the item "Shares and other equity" is the sum of equity outstanding and FDI. Since
intercompany debt is a subcategory of FDI, we adjust for these flows and attribute this item to
loans. "Other debt" consists of trade payables, taxes payable, pension fund contributions payable
and other debt.
