This article presents estimates based on the research conducted in 2010 of the
cost to the Ugandan health system of providing post-abortion care (PAC), filling
a gap in knowledge of the cost of unsafe abortion. Thirty-nine public and private
health facilities were sampled representing three levels of health care, and data
were collected on drugs, supplies, material, personnel time and out-of-pocket
expenses. In addition, direct non-medical costs in the form of overhead and
capital costs were also measured. Our results show that the average annual PAC
cost per client, across five types of abortion complications, was $131. The total
cost of PAC nationally, including direct non-medical costs, was estimated to be
$13.9 million per year. Satisfying all demand for PAC would raise the national
cost to $20.8 million per year. This shows that PAC consumes a substantial
portion of the total expenditure in reproductive health in Uganda. Investing
more resources in family planning programmes to prevent unwanted and
mistimed pregnancies would help reduce health systems costs.

KEY MESSAGES
 Post-abortion care consumes significant health resources in Uganda.
 Investing more in family planning programmes to prevent unwanted pregnancies would bring net financial benefits.
Introduction
In Uganda, deaths of women from complications of pregnancy
or childbirth are unacceptably high and the maternal mortality
ratio is estimated to be 310 maternal deaths per 100 000 live
births (WHO 2012). As legal abortion in Uganda remains highly
restricted and unmet need for contraception is high, many
women seek abortions in unsafe conditions, often from
unskilled providers. This has made unsafe abortion one of the
leading causes of maternal mortality in Uganda. A 2003 study
of abortion incidence in Uganda showed that abortion rates
were among the highest in the developing world, and unsafe
abortion was a major reproductive health issue (Singh et al.
2005). Although the health consequences of unsafe abortions
are fairly well known, there is scant knowledge of the costs to
the Ugandan health system and to the women and their
households. By showing how much the country will save if
recourse to unsafe abortion is prevented, the study provides
important evidence supporting need for policy and programme
change to lower the high incidence of unsafe abortion.
Caring for women with complications of unsafe abortion
often requires expensive treatment in terms of skilled person-
nel, surgical procedures, expensive drugs and supplies and
prolonged hospital stays (Johnston et al. 2007; Henshaw et al.

2008; Prada et al. 2005; Vlassoff et al. 2008), and unsafe
abortion continues to be a major contributor to the case load of
maternal and gynaecological services of the Ugandan health
system. However, studies on the costs of unsafe abortion to
health systems at the national level are limited, and attempts to
measure costs at the regional level have been made only
recently (Vlassoff et al. 2008, 2009a). A review of the literature
reveals that little research has been conducted on the direct
economic costs to women and households, or to national health
systems in sub-Saharan Africa (Woog et al. 2007).
With regard to Uganda, three studies have looked at the cost
of unsafe abortion. Johnston et al. (2007) estimated the cost of
post-abortion care (PAC) using data from a 1994 application of
the Mother-Baby Package costing spreadsheet to one district of
Uganda (Mbarara). Looking only at direct medical inputs the
study estimated an overall cost of $44.87. A second study (Levin
et al. 2003) collected cost data at two facilities in Masaka
district in 1998 on direct medical inputs and some overhead
costs. They estimated that $37.70 in direct medical inputs were
spent per PAC case and $8.82 in direct non-medical inputs.1
These two studies are based on data from the 1990s, indicating
a need for evidence on the current situation, as well as
estimates that include direct non-medical costs and that are
more broadly representative of the situation in the country as
a whole. A third and recent study, Babigumira et al. (2011),
used a decision-analysis model, applied to data from Mbarara
referral hospital inter alia, to estimate both societal costs and
health-system costs of induced abortion in Uganda. It found
that each induced abortion incurs a total cost of $177, of which
$85 is the direct medical and non-medical cost to the health
system and $92 is the indirect cost due to lost productivity. Our
study uses a health-system perspective and so does not attempt
to estimate indirect, societal costs.2 This study expands on the
study by Babigumira et al. by providing detailed cost estimates
based on an extensive set of current primary data collected
through a nationwide survey.
Data and methods
This study is based on data collected from a sample of 39 health
facilities in August­November 2010. This sample was purpos-
ively selected and was designed to include facilities providing
different levels of care and facilities with different ownership
structures (public, faith-based and private). The sample was
drawn from across the country and included both rural and
urban areas. This increased the likelihood of obtaining data that
covered the full spectrum of PAC experiences. At the tertiary
level of health care, 11 regional referral hospitals and 1 national
referral hospital were selected. At the secondary level, 17
hospitals were canvassed: seven district hospitals, two private
hospitals and eight faith-based hospitals. Ten primary-level
facilities were also selected: three Health Center IIIs and seven
Health Center IVs. Three health centres were private, operated
by nurse-midwives and seven were public facilities.
All major regions of Uganda were covered with the exception
of the north-east part of the country (Karamoja), which was
avoided for security reasons. Otherwise, the physical accessi-
bility of facilities was not a consideration in selecting the
sample. The facilities are located in 29 of the 80 districts of
Uganda.3 The survey respondents were experts who were
knowledgeable about PAC in their facilities because of their
many years of on-the-job experience. The respondents were
requested to provide responses on the detailed inputs4 into PAC
interventions that, in the aggregate, are needed to treat specific
post-abortion complications. As the interviews were lengthy,
interviewers were advised to split interviews into two or more
sessions to minimize respondent fatigue.
A 2007 study by the Guttmacher Institute developed protocols
for estimating the costs of unsafe abortion to the health system
and to women and their households (Guttmacher Institute,
unpublished data). The study instruments, consisting of two
types of questionnaires, were tested in three countries, Ethiopia,
Pakistan and Mexico. The health-system-cost component, now
referred to as the `Post-Abortion Care Costing Methodology'
(PACCM), is a variant of the `ingredients approach' (Johns et al.
2003; Weissman et al. 1999) and collects data from key
informants. The method was first used in an exploratory
study in Nigeria, which examined the cost of PAC (Bankole
et al. 2007). It was also used in a costing study undertaken in
Ethiopia in 2008 (Vlassoff et al. 2012). Our study builds on
these previous efforts by applying the method to a study that
includes facilities of all types, national coverage and estimates
of both direct medical and non-medical costs of providing PAC.
The questionnaires administered to healthcare providers and
facility managers collected detailed data on inputs needed for
estimating the cost of PAC. These included information on
personnel inputs of time, personnel wages, hospitalization
costs, overhead costs and capital costs associated with the
provision of PAC. Detailed data on the quantities of all drugs,
supplies and materials used in specific post-abortion treatments
were also collected. The averages of the estimates provided by
the respondents are assumed to yield a good approximation of
the true values of the various rates and amounts of specific
inputs. Direct-cost data were gathered for each of five types of
abortion complications--incomplete abortion, sepsis, shock,
cervical/vaginal laceration and uterine laceration/perforation.5
This categorization was taken from the World Health
Organization's classification concerning PAC (WHO 1999).
Respondents were queried on the time required to treat each
type of abortion complication as well as time spent in
non-treatment activities and the length of the work year, for
each category of health worker involved. In gathering wage data,
questions were asked on salary ranges, professional allowances,
housing allowances, transportation allowances and duty fees.
Some other benefits, such as medical workers' health insurance
and communication allowance, were not estimated. Thus, per-
sonnel cost estimates in this study are likely to somewhat
underestimate the true cost of labour. Data on labour costs were
collected for 11 categories of health workers, for the five
complication types and for the three levels of facilities. Costs of
hospitalization per bed per day were also collected.6 Finally, in a
section of the questionnaire on capital and overhead expenses, the
respondents were asked to estimate the life of the equipment,
capital costs for constructing new facilities, overhead costs and
referral rates between facilities.
Questions on the drugs, supplies and materials used in the
provision of treatments for specific post-abortion complications
were directed at care providers with specific experience in this
HEALTH SYSTEM COST OF POST-ABORTION CARE 57
area. The list of drugs and supplies was based on evidence from
previous studies in other countries, and the inputs listed in the
World Health Organization's `Mother-Baby Package' (WHO
1999).
Because the exact presentations, chemical strengths and
packaging for all of the drugs and supplies used in PAC were
not found in any centralized price list in Uganda, we used a
mixture of local prices and, when local data were lacking, prices
collected from a variety of international sources. We consulted
various standard price lists (Durbin 2005; UNICEF 2005; IDA
Foundation 2008; Management Sciences for Health 2008;
Pharma Professional Services 2008; UNFPA 2009). When
necessary, prices were extrapolated to 2010 by using World
Bank Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflators (World Bank
2010). The catalogue from the Joint Medical Store of Uganda
provided local prices for more than half of the inputs (JMS
2012) and JMS prices were used, when available, in preference
to international prices.7 Several factors that might influence the
final price, in either direction, were not measured because of
the time and cost of doing so. For example, spoilage, stocking
costs and transportation costs, which would typically inflate
final prices, were not included in the calculations. At the same
time, discounts available through the centralized procurement
of drugs and supplies, which would tend to decrease costs, were
also excluded from the model.8
The annual capital cost9 for PAC for each type of facility was
calculated as follows:
PacCost ¼ AmortAnnualCapitalCost/PacShare
where PacCost is the annual capital cost attributable to treating
a single PAC case; AmortAnnualCapitalCost is the amortized cost
per year of useful life10 and PacShare is the proportion of all
cases treated by the facility that are related to post-abortion
complications.
Data on quantities of inputs were collected according to what
was typically needed for treating specific complications thus
yielding estimates of `costs per treatment'. As some patients
may have more than one complication treated simultaneously,
further calculations were performed to produce estimates of
`costs per case'. These unit costs are disaggregated by healthcare
level, type of input, cost categories and type of complication.
The same analysis is done to estimate total costs at the national
level, which yields an estimate of the national health care bill
due to unsafe abortion.
A sensitivity analysis is undertaken to gauge the degree to
which errors in measuring different factors affect cost esti-
mates. It also provides an interval estimate of costs. A subset of
variables from the survey data was selected by inspection and
cost estimates were calculated serially for maximum and
minimum values of each variable.11
Estimating the number of PAC cases
Table 1 (top panel) shows inter alia estimates of how PAC cases
were distributed across the levels of health facilities in the
Uganda healthcare system based on facility records, and
estimates made by respondents. Regional hospitals handled
10 times more PAC cases annually than did general (district)
hospitals, which in turn treated twice the number of cases as
did primary level facilities. The estimates provided by survey
respondents tended to be higher, indicating either that they
suspected some under-reporting in the facility statistics, or that
the number of PAC cases had increased since the statistics were
last recorded. We use the caseload estimates from key inform-
ants in calculations of total national costs.
Only PAC cases associated with induced abortion were
considered in this study--PAC cases from spontaneous abor-
tions were not included. Two-thirds of PAC patients were
treated for incomplete abortion, 22% for sepsis and 9% for
shock. In general, serious complications, such as lacerations
and perforations were more common at higher level facilities
than lower level ones. Across all 39 facilities, each PAC patient
was treated, on average, for 1.08 complications.
Table 1 also shows the numbers of cases of rare, but very serious
complications. These include morbidities, such as peritonitis,
renal failure, etc. The cost of treating these rare conditions is not
estimated in this study, so the overall costs to be presented below
are slightly under-estimated on that account.
The reported prevalence of PAC cases in the health system
(e.g. PAC cases as a percent of all facility admissions) is also
shown in Table 1. Two sources of information were available:
the estimates of survey respondents and estimates available
from the statistical records of the facilities. Table 1 shows
averages, by facility type, from these two sources.12 Overall, we
estimated that a little under 5% of all patients presenting at
health facilities in Uganda in 2010 were admitted for PAC.13
A study of contraceptive needs in Uganda estimated that
around 2.2 million pregnancies occurred in 2008 (Vlassoff et al.
2009a). Of these, 56% or 1.2 million were unplanned pregnan-
cies. An estimated 362 000 of these unintended pregnancies
resulted in induced abortions in 2008.14 Assuming that increases
in the annual number of abortions were proportional to popu-
lation growth, the number of induced abortions in 2010 would be
386 000.15 Of this group of women, the number who obtained
care at health facilities for complications are shown in the bottom
panel of Table 1. To arrive at these estimates, we used the number
of PAC cases estimated in the 2003 abortion incidence study
(Singh et al. 2005) and extrapolated them to 2010.16 We then
used the percentage distribution of PAC cases by type of facility
in the 2003 incidence study to arrive at the estimates shown in
the final panel of Table 1. For 2010, we estimated the total
number of PAC cases in Uganda to be 105 900.
Many women who have unsafe abortions and develop serious
complications never reach a health facility. Information is
scanty on how large this group of women is, but globally it has
been estimated that there is around one such woman for every
two PAC cases attended to by health facilities (Singh et al.
2009). Thus, in Uganda in 2010, women with `untreated'
abortion complications (at least untreated by the formal health
system) may total more than 50 000 women.
The 2010 survey showed that most PAC cases are treated as
inpatients in Uganda. Computed over all complications and all
facilities, only around 20% of PAC patients were outpatients,
whereas 80% (not shown in Table 1) were inpatients.17 While
hospitals treated only a small percentage of cases of incomplete
abortion as outpatients, health centres reported substantial
numbers of outpatients for cases of incomplete abortion, sepsis
and lacerations. In many of these cases, minimal treatment
was given, such as dispensing analgesics, and the patients were
then referred to a higher-level facility.
58 HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
Limitations of the study
The sample of facilities was purposive rather than random. This
impeded the use of statistical probability analysis. However, we
preferred to purposely select facilities where it was known that
PAC caseloads would be substantial and where there would be
respondents well versed in the details of post-abortion treat-
ments. We reasoned that the variability in treatment standards
and inputs used would not be large among facilities of the
same type. For scaling estimates up to the national level we
relied on data from the 2003 abortion incidence survey, which
was based on random sampling. Thus, we assume that the
conditions of abortion provision have remained the same over
the intervening period.
The PACCM approach relies on expert opinion and estimates.
The methodology is a low-cost one meant to generate reliable cost
estimates where a certain amount of precision is traded off against
the cost of collecting data. The validity of the data rests on the
long experience in providing PAC of the professionals interviewed.
Certain inputs were also difficult or impossible to measure
with high precision. The future rate of inflation, for instance,
cannot be known: we followed the usual practice of assuming a
constant rate of 3% per year. Drugs come in a sometimes
bewildering variety of presentations. We adopted an averaging
approach when confronted with a variety of options in
presentation, packaging, bundling, strength, etc. Determining
the price of labour is similarly imprecise at the margin:
although we accounted for the main components of wages,
several particular benefits and compensations were not taken
into account due to their complexity, implying that labour costs
are thus slightly underestimated.
Results
Direct medical costs
Costs of drugs and supplies
Costs per case of drugs and supplies increased with the level of
care, from $22 in health centres to $41 in regional hospitals
(Table 2).18 This relationship was expected since more severe
complications tend to be treated in higher level facilities.
Lower-level facilities, lacking the required personnel, supplies
and infrastructure, are more likely to refer critical patients to
higher level facilities.19 The costs of drugs and supplies for
outpatients were also found to be dramatically lower than for
inpatient costs (not shown in table). This is consistent with the
practice in Uganda of treating all but the least severe compli-
cations as inpatients. The costs of drugs, supplies and other
materials used in treating cases of shock, sepsis, incomplete
abortion and lacerations were remarkably similar, varying
between $23 and $28 per intervention across all patients
(Table 2, bottom panel). For treatment of uterine perforations,

HEALTH SYSTEM COST OF POST-ABORTION CARE 59
the average per-intervention cost of drugs and supplies was far
higher at $81.
The main drivers of costs in the category of drugs and
supplies, which included laboratory tests, varied according to
type of treatment. In treating incomplete abortion, for instance,
the principal drivers were procedures, such as ultrasound and
blood tests, sterilized gloves and some expensive drugs, such as
ceftriaxon and metronidazole. In treating uterine perforations,
on the other hand, operating room supplies, such as surgical
drapes, gloves, anaesthetic drugs and special needle holders
were the major cost drivers.
Medicines and supplies were the costliest direct inputs used in
treatment, accounting overall for 58% of direct treatment costs
(Table 2, middle panel). In health centres drugs, supplies and
other materials amounted to 62% of all direct medical costs.
Costs of personnel
The proportions of cases seen by health workers and the time
spent treating patients are two of the main factors in
determining personnel costs. The proportion of patients seen
by health personnel varied considerably by type of facility and
by cadre (not shown in Table 2). For example, in regional
hospitals only 18% of patients suffering from incomplete
abortion were attended to by anaesthetists, but 97% of these
patients saw midwives and 92% saw drug dispensers in the
facilities. On the other hand, all the patients receiving
treatment for perforations were attended to by anaesthetists,
but only 33% by nursing assistants. The average number of
minutes that health workers spent attending patients also
varied considerably by category of worker and by type of
complication. For instance, at district hospitals general practi-
tioners and gynaecologists spent 53­71 min with patients
suffering from hypovolaemic shock, whereas nurses and mid-
wives spent 113­136 min (not shown in table).
The average cost of labour per case was $15 at district hospitals
and regional hospitals, and $10 at health centres (Table 2, top
panel). This difference reflected the greater severity of the cases
treated at hospitals and the more costly make up of the care
givers. Nonetheless, the proportion of direct medical costs spent
in labour inputs varied little by facility type, from 25% for
regional hospitals to 28% for health centres.
The cost of labour per PAC intervention varied by complication
(Table 2, bottom panel). Treating lacerations and incomplete
abortions had the lowest average cost of labour ($12­$13). The
cost of labour for treating sepsis and shock ranged from $15 to
$16 and the labour cost for repairing a perforated uterus was the
most expensive in terms of labour input, amounting to $26.
Other direct medical costs
Data were also collected on two other direct costs: hospitaliza-
tion costs and outpatient special fees. As seen in Table 2,
hospitalization (accommodation and meals only) was an
important component of cost, comprising 7­19% of total
direct medical costs. District hospitals had considerably higher
hospitalization costs per PAC case ($11) than did regional
hospitals ($5.40) or health centres ($2.50).20 In the bottom
panel of Table 2, we see that cases of sepsis on average incurred
the highest cost of hospitalization ($11), followed by treatment
of perforations ($7.50).
The average length of stay (not shown in Table 2) varied--as
expected--by both type of facility and treatment. Post-abortion
cases spent an average of 3.8 days in regional referral hospitals
but only 1.6 days in health centres. In regional hospitals,
patients being treated for incomplete abortion stayed, on

average, for 1.4 days, whereas women suffering uterine perfor-
ations remained hospitalized for an average of 7.3 days.
Outpatients often paid special fees to receive treatment.21
These are also shown in the top panel of Table 2. The estimated
average fees22 for outpatients, ranging from $0.10 to $0.99,
were not found to be an important driver of PAC costs.
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that, while special outpatient
fees comprised only 1% of the total cost per case, they
amounted to around 3% of the total for health centres where
most outpatient care is concentrated.
Direct non-medical costs
Very few costing studies of PAC have attempted to compute
direct non-medical costs (Vlassoff et al. 2008). These costs are,
however, an important component of total costs. In the United
Nations, global estimates of reproductive health costs, for
instance, direct non-medical costs23 are estimated at roughly
twice the magnitude of direct medical costs in sub-Saharan
Africa (United Nations 2009). In other studies, one quarter to
one-third of total PAC costs have been estimated to be
non-medical (Vlassoff et al. 2008). This study is the first
thoroughgoing attempt to measure the direct non-medical costs
to the health system with regard to PAC.
Table 3 shows results for both overhead and capital costs. The
survey collected overhead costs in two broad categories: the cost
of ancillary workers in the health system; and maintenance and
other operational costs. The details of what comprised these
two categories are given in notes to Table 3. In 2010, the total
annual wage bill for ancillary workers per facility was $41 000
across all health facilities sampled, ranging from $64 000 for
large hospitals to around $11 000 for health centres. On
average, our study showed that regional referral hospitals
employed 43 workers, district hospitals 28 workers and health
centres 9 workers for ancillary, non-care tasks. The average
annual maintenance and operating cost per facility was $53 000
(ranging from $13 000 to $124 000). Thus, the total average
overhead cost per sample facility amounted to $94 000 per
annum and the portion of that total attributable to the care of
post-abortion patients was $4500 per facility--$10 000 for
regional hospitals, $2800 for district hospitals and $1100 for
health centres. Interestingly, however, the average overhead
cost `per PAC case' varied relatively little due to the distribution
of PAC cases by level of care. Thus, on average $20 of overhead
expense went into the treatment of one PAC case at regional
hospitals and health centres, whereas $16 was spent at district
hospitals. At every level, overhead costs were a significant
component of the total cost of PAC to the health system.
Capital cost estimates are shown in the lower panel of
Table 3. Overall estimates of capital costs for the infrastructure
and equipment of the facilities were obtained from the key
informants. Estimates of actual facility lifetimes (total years of
use) were also asked for in the survey. Regional hospitals were
estimated to cost $43 million on average to construct and equip,
while health centres cost $1.3 million. At the same time,
respondents reported that facilities were used for several
decades before being replaced by new infrastructure, ranging
from 68 years for regional hospitals to 33 years for health
centres.
Using the case of health centres as an example, the propor-
tion of the annual amortized cost attributable to PAC was
$3100 and the annual capital cost per PAC case was $55.24
The cost of capital was greatest for regional hospitals at $158
per PAC case compared with $98 at district hospitals.

HEALTH SYSTEM COST OF POST-ABORTION CARE 61
Discussion
Total costs per case
The total direct costs of all inputs per PAC case, both medical
and non-medical, by facility type across all types of complica-
tions are shown in Table 4. The overall cost per PAC case was
estimated to be $131. Treatment of post-abortion cases at
regional hospitals cost $239 on average, while $111 was spent
on average at health centres. The direct medical cost per case--
$41 overall--was closely related to the level of care. Regional
hospitals expended $62 on direct inputs to treatment, district
hospitals $56 and health centres $35 (Table 4).
Overall, 68% of the total direct cost of PAC was non-
medical--expenditures in capital and overhead that were not
directly tied to the provision of care but which were necessary
for the health system to be able to provide care services at all.
The non-medical component of costs at regional hospitals was
74% of the total, but 67­68% of total costs were non-medical at
district hospitals and health centres. More than three quarters
of direct non-medical costs were capital costs ($71), while the
remainder ($19) was overhead costs expended on general
maintenance and infrastructure operations.
National cost of PAC
Using estimates of costs per case and cost per treatment,
national total annual costs for treating post-abortion complica-
tions in Uganda were calculated for 2010. These are shown in
Table 5, which breaks down total costs by care level, by
abortion complication (where applicable) and by cost compo-
nent. The total cost to the Uganda health system for treating
PAC in 2010, including direct medical and non-medical
costs, was estimated to be $13.9 million (bottom panel).25
Two-thirds of this amount, or $9.5 million, went to non-medical
costs (overhead and infrastructure) and the remaining
third ($4.4 million) was spent on direct medical inputs
(drugs, supplies, labour, hospitalization and outpatient fees).
Hospitalization accounted for 3.4% of total expenditure, drugs
and supplies for 18.9% and the wage bill for 8.6%.
As can be seen in the three upper panels of Table 5,
incomplete abortion was by far the costliest PAC complication,
comprising more than three-fifths of total direct medical costs.
Sepsis accounted for one-fifth of such expenditure, while
lacerations and perforations each consumed only around
3­6% of direct medical inputs. In terms of level of care, most
PAC expenditure was concentrated in health centres ($8.4 mil-
lion or 61%), followed by district hospitals ($4.0 million or 29%)
and then by regional hospitals ($1.5 million or 11%).
Sensitivity analysis
Since the data collected in this study were largely based on best
estimates of key experts, we undertook a sensitivity analysis.
Given that data on several hundred inputs were collected in the
study, an inspection of the data set was made to narrow down
consideration to a subset of variables likely to have the largest
effect on the overall cost-per-case estimate. Twenty-three such
variables were selected spanning all major components of PAC
costs.
The central estimate of the national cost for PAC treatment in
2010, as shown in Table 5, was $13.9 million. The variable to
which this estimate was the most sensitive was the capital cost
of infrastructure and equipment of health facilities: the total
cost ranged from $12.0 to $15.8 million when this variable was
set at its minimum or its maximum value. However, total cost
was insensitive to most of the selected variables. For example,
the estimated time doctors spent in treating cases of incomplete
abortion, when set at the minimum and maximum values,
changed the total cost of PAC by only $0.03 million ($30 000)
above or below the mean value.
When all 23 variables were set to their minimum values, the
overall national cost decreased to $9.9 million, while when all
assumed their maximum values it increased to $22.2 million.26
While it is extremely improbable that the true values of all the
variables would lie in the same direction (i.e. all either below
their means or all above them), this range may be thought of as
a confidence interval within which the true overall cost most
likely lies.27
The relative sensitivity of the 23 selected variables is displayed
in Table 6. The first column shows the ratio of the overall cost,
calculated at the minimum value of a particular variable, to the
cost calculated using the variable's mean value. The second
column shows similar ratios using maximum values. The third
column shows the arithmetic difference between these two sets
of ratios. For example, the eighth variable, the cost of hos-
pitalization per night, yielded an total cost 0.9% less or 0.9%
more than the central estimate when minimum or maximum
values were substituted for the mean value, and the spread
was, thus, 1.7 percentage points. The variables in Table 6 are
listed in order of the relative sensitivity of cost estimates to
changes in their value. Thus, the proportion of all patients who
are PAC cases was the most sensitive variable, followed by the
estimated cost of a facility's infrastructure and equipment, the
presumed future rate of inflation, the estimated useful lifetime
of infrastructure and non-wage overhead costs. This highlights
the importance of giving non-medical cost data greater prom-
inence in the design of future studies of PAC costs. Fourteen of
the other variables examined had a spread of one percentage
point or less. Moreover, the estimate of total cost was virtually
insensitive to changes in the last 10 variables listed in the table.

Conclusion and implications
We estimate that the cost of treating post-abortion complica-
tions in Uganda in 2010 stood at $13.9 million. Given that
the data from the survey are largely based on key informants,
we subjected the data to a sensitivity analysis, which showed
that the total cost of unsafe abortion to the Ugandan health
system most likely lies in the range of $9.9­$22.2 million.
Total expenditure on health in Uganda in 2010 is reported to be
$1.56 billion and, of that, the amount spent by the government of
Uganda was roughly $340 million (WHO 2011). The total amount
spent in Uganda on maternal and newborn health--in both
public and private sectors--was estimated at around $350 million
(Vlassoff et al. 2009a). Thus, our estimates indicate that the cost of
treating post-abortion complications from unsafe abortion pro-
cedures may be around 4.0% of total spending on maternal and
newborn health and equivalent to 4.1% of total government
spending on health. The cost of unsafe abortion to the health
system is, therefore, a substantial one.
Although evidence is very limited, surveys of key informants
show that a large proportion of women suffering abortion
complications never access services through the formal health
system (Singh et al. 2005). Globally, it has been estimated that
the number of such women is around 50% of the number
who do reach health facilities (Singh et al. 2009). This implies
that the total cost of PAC in 2010 would have amounted to
$20.8 million if all women with complications had been able
and willing to access facility-based care. We must bear in mind,
however, that this estimate is based on expert opinion, not
population-based data, and also that women not attending
health facilities may have less severe symptoms on average
than those who do. Despite this uncertainty, there is no doubt
that treating all women who have an unmet demand for PAC
would pose a significant additional cost on the health system
in Uganda. Improvement of the health system is, therefore,
a priority if Uganda is to meet the post-abortion needs of its
women.

HEALTH SYSTEM COST OF POST-ABORTION CARE 63
It needs to be emphasized that this study looks at only one
element of the cost of unsafe abortions--the immediate cost to
the health system of treating post-abortion complications. There
are many other substantial costs involved (Vlassoff et al. 2008)
including the treatment of longer-term morbidities that result
from unsafe abortion--especially the high cost of infertility
treatment--as well as the economic cost to Ugandan house-
holds and society of productive time lost through abortion-
related morbidity and mortality.
Ultimately, better health policy should be aimed at preventing
the root cause of unsafe abortion in Uganda--namely the large
number of unintended pregnancies. About 1.2 million unin-
tended pregnancies occur every year in Uganda, largely due
to unmet need for contraception (Vlassoff et al. 2009a).
A cost­benefit analysis in Nigeria showed that extra spending
on family planning would lead to large net benefits (savings)
from reduced expenditure in PAC services (Bankole et al. 2007).
A similar argument can be made here. The cost of supplying the
methods of contraception most widely used in Uganda for
1 year has been estimated at around $22 per user (Vlassoff et al.
2009a). If we compare this to the overall cost-per-case for
treating post-abortion complications ($131) we can see that
there is a large cost­benefit advantage to preventing unwanted
pregnancies in Uganda. The benefit­cost ratio of adopting such
a strategy would be almost 6:1; i.e. every dollar spent in family
planning would save more than five dollars in PAC services
averted.
In Uganda, legal abortion remains highly restricted and
unmet demand for contraception is high. To promote policy
discussion in this area, there is a clear need for the research
into the economic effects resulting from illegal, unsafe abortion.
The findings from this study should be interesting for scholars,
policy makers and advocates who are striving to reduce the
health and economic costs of unsafe abortion. The cost
estimates from this study are useful to guide discussions on
how to prevent and treat post-abortion complications in a
country where abortion is restricted.

Endnotes
1 We use the term `direct medical costs' to refer to inputs directly related
to the provision of medical care and `direct non-medical costs' to
refer to health-system costs not related to actual treatment, such as
overhead and capital costs.
2 Another study of the costs of unsafe abortion to women and
households (the societal perspective) is being undertaken in
conjunction with the study reported here and will report its
findings in the near future.
3 New districts are frequently carved out of existing districts in Uganda,
so the total number of districts changes often.
4 `Input' (`ingredient') is used here to mean any physical thing that is
used in the provision of a particular treatment. Aspirin tablets,
syringes, sterile gloves, minutes spent by health workers and
sonograms are all examples of inputs.
5 The category `uterine perforation' also includes cases of other lower
abdominal perforations and hysterectomies.
6 To avoid double counting, only the `hotel' components of the cost of
hospitalization are used in the analysis. These components include
accommodation and meals.
7 In practice, the two sets of prices were quite comparable: of 51
overlapping inputs, 26 JMS prices were lower than international
ones and 25 were higher.
8 Foreign donors may sometimes procure drugs and supplies free of
charge to developing countries. We do not take such contingencies
into account since we are concerned in this paper with how much
PAC costs, not with who pays for it.
9 Capital costs comprised the cost of construction of the facility and the
complete equipping of it, including furniture, vehicles and
specialized machines and equipment, such as X-ray machines,
laboratory equipment, etc. Facilities often had records of construc-
tion costs that could be consulted.
10 Amortization was calculated as follows. If a constant rate of inflation
is assumed, then the annual write off or depreciation of capital
should take this into account. The annual depreciation amount
should be adjusted upwards so that the present value of all such
amounts is equal the amount of the original investment. Here, we
assume an annual rate of inflation of 3%. `Useful' lifetime means
the number of years a facility is actually in use for the purpose for
which it was intended until it needs to be replaced.
11 For most variables, the minimum was 75% of the variable's central
estimate and the maximum was 125% of the central estimate.
12 The Ministry of Health, Uganda (MOH) estimates were higher than
those of the experts. A further data source available for estimating
the share of PAC cases in the system's total caseload is MOH
statistics on the distribution of maternal-health cases, including
PAC cases, for the period 2005­8. Combining these MOH statistics
with estimates of the proportion of all cases that are maternal and
newborn cases, which we obtained from our study, we get an
estimate of the share of PAC in the system's total caseload
considerably higher than the estimates noted earlier. In our
analysis we chose to use the more conservative estimates shown
in Table 1.
13 These percentages are used to estimate the proportions of overhead
and capital costs to assign to PAC.
14 This number is an extrapolation from the original 2003 estimate of
induced abortions. See Singh et al. (2005).
15 The annual population growth rate over the period 2003­10 in
Uganda was 3.23% (UN Population Division, online data, accessed
22 November 2011).
16 Although our survey collected data on the number of PAC cases, we
decided to use estimates from the 2003 survey as our survey was
not a probabilistic one. The 2003 facility-based treatment rate per
1000 women of reproductive age was applied to women of
reproductive age in 2010, assuming that the rate remained the
same over this period of time.
17 However, being a PAC inpatient in Uganda does not necessarily imply
staying in the facility overnight: many inpatients are discharged
the same day as they are treated after spending several hours
recuperating in the facility.
18 All costs in this study are given in 2010 US dollars (USD).
19 Other effects may also be influencing this relationship: higher level
facilities may have better access to a wider range of drugs,
technology and equipment and may therefore expend more inputs
than lower level facilities.
20 The reported per-day fee of hospitalization is the factor that elevated
the cost at district hospitals compared with other facilities. The
average fee charged at district hospitals was almost three times the
fee at regional hospitals. The fee at health centres was almost twice
that of regional hospitals. A possible explanation for this seemingly
counter-intuitive finding is that the informal charging of user fees
(see below) may be more prevalent in rural settings than in urban
ones.
21 User fees were abolished at primary care public facilities in 2001
(Xu et al. 2005). In practice, however, the collection of user fees has
continued informally in several facilities.
22 Special fees include unofficial fees for service and any special fees
such as a fee for use of the operating theatre. They do not include
the costs of drugs or supplies which the patients may have to buy
separately.
23 Indirect costs are also called `programme and system costs' and
comprise overhead costs for programme management, supervision,
health education, monitoring and evaluation, advocacy, human
resources training, information systems, commodity supply sys-
tems and capital costs for maintaining and expanding the physical
capacity of health facilities (United Nations 2009).
24 As an example of how inflation assumptions affect this estimate,
with inflation at 0%, the cost per PAC case at health centres would fall
to $34; with inflation at 4%, the annual cost would rise to $642.
25 In comparison, using African regional estimates of PAC costs from
Vlassoff et al. (2009b) and the Ugandan share of the population of
Africa, we would calculate a PAC cost per case of $16.8 million
(2010 USD), including both direct and indirect costs.
26 The size of this range of estimates is largely accounted for by the
sensitivity of cost estimates to a few of the indirect cost variables
as shown in Table 6. The range of estimates for direct costs is
much narrower, between $3.9 and $5.1 million.
27 All the other variables left out of the sensitivity analysis would
contribute very little to the variation of the cost estimate even if
they were included.
