Introduction
Hypertension is considered a major risk factor for throm-
botic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, as
there is strong evidence linking hypertension to a prothrom-
botic state driven by endothelial dysfunction, reduced
fibrinolytic potential and platelet hyperactivity. A growing
body of evidence indicates that the prothrombotic state can
be induced by the activated renin­angiotensin system, which
is more pronounced in hypertension.1,2 Antihypertensive
treatment and lifestyle modifications, with exercise being an
integral component, are the cornerstone treatment for blood
pressure (BP) control and prevention of cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD) in hypertensive patients.3,4 Beneficial effects of
physical activity as well as of antihypertensive medical treat-
ment that blocks the renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system
(RAAS) seem to be mediated by mechanisms independent of
BP lowering. Indeed, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tors (ACE-Is) in hypertensive patients have shown a benefi-
cialorneutraleffectonendothelialfunction,plateletfunction,
fibrinolysis and hypercoagulability, depending on which of

Abstract
Introduction: Hypertension links to a prothrombotic state driven by endothelial dysfunction, reduced fibrinolytic potential
and platelet hyperactivity. We hypothesized that ramipril treatment would favourably modify the haemostatic response
to a submaximal aerobic exercise session in hypertensives.
Methods: Twenty-four hypertensive patients underwent a submaximal exercise test before and after 13±2 months
of treatment with ramipril ± hydrochlorothiazide. Hypercoagulability (prothrombin fragments [PF1+2], thrombin­
antithrombin complex [TAT] and D-dimers [Dd]), fibrinolytic activity (plasmin­a2-antiplasmin complex [PAP]), endothe-
lial function (von Willebrand factor [vWf] and soluble thrombomodulin [sTM]), and platelet function (soluble P-selectin
[sPsel]) were measured before, at peak and one hour after exercise.
Results: Antihypertensive treatment resulted in an increase of PAP, vWf and sTM. During the first exercise, PF1+2 were
mildly increased at peak exercise (p<0.05), while D-dimers, PAP and vWf varied significantly throughout the exercise
(p<0.001). During the second exercise session, PF1+2 were decreased post-exercise (p<0.05), PAP was increased at
peak and post-exercise (p<0.001) and vWf was increased at peak (p<0.05) and post-exercise (p<0.001).
Conclusions: The haemostatic response to exercise in hypertensives after approximately one year of ramipril treatment is
characterized by the attenuated activation of coagulation, enhanced fibrinolysis and endothelial activation.

haemostatic markers in hypertensive patients has not yet
been studied.
In a previous study, we demonstrated that a single bout
of submaximal aerobic exercise in patients with recently
diagnosed and never treated mild-to-moderate essential
hypertension leads to enhanced fibrinolysis compared with
a mild increase of coagulation indices.9 In the present study,
we hypothesized that the haemostatic response to a sub-
maximal aerobic exercise session could be modified
favourably in hypertensive patients treated with an ACE-I,
ramipril. The markers of hypercoagulability, fibrinolytic
activity, endothelial and platelet function that were chosen
as markers of haemostatic system activation represent in
parallel novel risk factors of atherosclerosis and predictors
of acute coronary events in the high-risk population.
Materials and methods
Twenty-four non-diabetic patients (53±10 years old, 18
men) with never-treated grade I­II essential hypertension
attending the out-patient clinic of our department were
recruited for the study. Diagnosis of hypertension was
based on both repeated office measurements and 24 h
ambulatory BP measurements, according to ESC/ESH
guidelines.4 Echocardiography was performed in all
patients at baseline evaluation. No signs of left ventricular
hypertrophy were recorded.
Patients with secondary hypertension, congestive heart
failure, previous myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy,
stroke, cardiac valve diseases, history of coronary artery
by-pass grafting, rhythm other than sinus, renal insuffi-
ciency, overt proteinuria, diabetes mellitus or lung disease
and patients under medication for non-cardiovascular dis-
eases were excluded from the study. Patients who were not
physically able to perform exercise testing as well as those
involved in a structured exercise programme, defined as
more than three 30-min workouts per week, were also
excluded from the study. None of the hypertensive patients
was being treated with a statin or cardioactive medication
and none of the female patients was on hormone replace-
ment treatment. Informed consent was obtained from all
participants in the study while the protocol was approved
by the ethical committee of our hospital.
The first phase of our protocol (pre-treatment period and
first exercise test) is described in our previous study report.9
Briefly, in order to exclude coronary artery disease, all
patients underwent a pre-treatment treadmill maximal exer-
cise stress test (EST) according to the Bruce protocol. One
week later, each patient underwent a submaximal exercise
test on a bicycle ergometer and blood samples were drawn
pre-exercise, at peak exercise and 1 h post-exercise. The
second phase of our protocol consists of antihypertensive
treatment with ramipril ± hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)
commencing after the first submaximal exercise test.
Patients were started on ramipril 2.5 mg and changed, if
necessary (BP >140/90 mmHg), to either 5 mg ramipril or
2.5 mg ramipril + 12.5 mg HCTZ after 15 days of treatment.
After a period of one month, patients were re-evaluated and,
if necessary, either 25 mg HCTZ was added to 5 mg of rami-
pril, or 2.5 mg ramipril + 12.5 mg HCTZ was increased to 5
mg ramipril + 25 mg HCTZ. After this adjustment, all
patients had BP <140/90 mmHg (16 patients on ramipril +
HCTZ and eight patients on ramipril only). Patients were
also advised to stop smoking, reduce salt intake and alcohol
consumption, lose weight and start walking at least three
times per week. We revaluated the patients regarding their
BP control at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after antihypertensive
treatment initiation. After approximately 13±2 months of
treatment, patients underwent a second submaximal exer-
cise test. The exercise protocol consisted of 45 min submax-
imal exercise (65­70% of maximum predicted heart rate
according to the Bruce protocol) followed by 6 min of
recovery. BP and heart rate were recorded at baseline, every
10 min during exercise and every 2 min during the recovery
phase. Again, blood samples were drawn pre-exercise, at
peak exercise and 1 h post-exercise.
Blood samples were drawn by clean venepuncture (20-
gauge needle) from an antecubital vein under controlled
venous stasis: (a) after 30 min rest (pre-exercise), (b) imme-
diately after exercise (peak exercise) and (c) one hour after
exercise (post-exercise). All venipunctures were taken in a
reclined position. Whole blood was collected in tubes con-
taining sodium citrate anticoagulant 3.2% and within 30
min of phlebotomy, was centrifuged for 15 min at 2500g at
room temperature.
Prothrombin fragments 1+2 (PF 1+2) and thrombin­
antithrombin complex (TAT) served as markers of throm-
bin generation and D-dimers as markers of fibrin
formation. Plasmin­a2-antiplasmin complex (PAP) was
used as an index of fibrinolysis. Endothelial function was
evaluated by the levels of both von Willebrand factor anti-
gen (vWf) and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM). Platelet
functional status was assessed by measuring the levels of
soluble P-selectin (sPsel). Diurnal variation of haemo-
static variables was avoided since blood samples were
drawn for each patient at approximately the same time
of day.
The supernatant plasma was removed, divided into ali-
quots, snap-frozen at -80°C and stored until assayed.
PF1+2 (Enzygnost* PF1+2, Siemens, Germany), TAT
(Enzygnost® TAT micro Kit, Siemens, Germany), PAP
(PAP microElisa, DRG Diagnostics, Germany), sTM
(Asserachrom® Thrombomodulin, Diagnostica Stago,
France) and sPsel (Human sP-selectin, Diaclone) were
determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) with
commercially available kits. D-Dimers (STA®-Liatest®-
D-Di, Diagnostica Stago, France) and von Willebrand fac-
tor antigen (vWF Ag® Reagent, Siemens, Germany) were
determined by immunoturbidimetricity in an STA analyzer.
The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation for
324 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)
the parameters studied are as follows: PF1+2: 3.6­5.5%
and 4.4­11.2%; TAT: 4­6% and 6­9%; D-dimers: 0.29­
0.71 and 0.32­2.78; PAP: 2.1­6.3% and 3.5­11%; sTM:
4.8% and 8%, sPsel: (0.7­4.2%) and (1.6­7.5%) and vWf:
(1.4­4.2%) and (0.9­4.2%), respectively.
Statistical analysis
Anormality test was performed for all variables. No param-
eter followed a normal distribution during the first exercise
session or the second exercise session, vWf levels excluded.
Repeated measure analysis of variance (repeated
ANOVA) for normally and Friedman non-parametric test
for abnormally distributed values were performed in order
to investigate whether changes of markers studied were sig-
nificant either between the two sessions (1st and 2nd exer-
cises) or across all time points in the 2nd exercise session
(pre-exercise, peak exercise and post-exercise). Results are
expressed as means ± SD and minimum­maximum values
for parametric variables and as medians and interquartile
ranges for non-parametric variables. The level of statistical
significance was set at p<0.05. Data were analyzed using
SPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL).
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients
before initiation and after approximately one year antihy-
pertensive treatment are shown in Table 1. Body mass index,
body surface area and lipid levels did not differ within two
groups. All participants completed uneventfully a treadmill
exercise stress test without evidence of myocardial ischae-
mia or arrhythmia before the first submaximal exercise on
the ergometric bicycle. Both exercise sessions on the
ergometric bicycle were also successfully completed. Levels
of markers of hypercoagulability, fibrinolysis, endothelial
function and platelet function during the first exercise ses-
sion are described in our previous study.9 In Figure 1, the
exercise-induced changes in haemostatic parameters during
both submaximal exercise sessions are described.
Changes in haemostatic parameters
compared with baseline
After a period of antihypertensive treatment, significant
changes were observed in PAP, vWf and sTM compared to
pre-treatment levels, while PF1+2, TAT, D-dimers and sPsel
remained unchanged. In particular, there was a marked ele-
vation of PAP complex while vWf and sTM were mildly
increased in treated hypertensive patients (Table 2).
Thrombin generation and fibrin formation
Variations in TAT were not significantly different between
the two exercise sessions. On the contrary, PF1+2 changed
significantly between the two exercise sessions. In the first
session, a mild increase in PF1+2 was induced at peak exer-
cise, which did not remain significantly elevated post-exer-
cise. Interestingly, in the second session, PF1+2 levels were
significantly decreased post-exercise compared with pre-
exercise levels. Finally, D-dimer levels varied significantly
throughout the first exercise session whereas they remained
stable during the second session.
Fibrinolysis
Both exercise sessions bought about a significant increase
in PAP complex levels. During the first exercise session a

two-fold increase in PAP was observed at peak exercise
which was almost sustained until post-exercise. In a similar
way, during the second exercise session, PAP levels were
increased 1.6-fold at peak exercise and 1.4-fold post-exer-
cise, compared with pre-exercise levels.
Platelets
Levels of sPsel did not vary significantly in both exercise
sessions. Interestingly, a trend towards a sPsel increase
which was noticed at peak exercise during the first exercise
session, disappeared during the second exercise.
Endothelium
Exercise-induced endothelial activation, as measured by an
increase in vWf levels, was revealed during both exercise
sessions. vWf release was significantly higher at peak exer-
cise and post-exercise compared with pre-exercise levels
in both exercise sessions. However, the thrombomodulin

remained unchanged throughout both exercise sessions.
Blood pressure
The BP response in treated hypertensives during submaxi-
mal exercise was not exaggerated (no one had a systolic BP
response above 160 mmHg).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study which explores the
effect of specific antihypertensive treatment on the haemo-
static response to an acute submaximal exercise in patients
with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Twenty-four newly
diagnosed and never treated hypertensive patients partici-
pated in an exercise protocol which was repeated approxi-
mately one year later while being on antihypertensive
treatment with ramipril. Our results showed that blocking
RAAS for a year may lead to changes in some haemostatic
variables at rest and have a favourable impact on the hae-
mostatic response to exercise.
On pre-exercise measurements, no effect of antihyper-
tensive treatment was revealed on markers of hypercoagu-
lability. On the contrary, the fibrinolytic capacity was
generally enhanced. Present data on the effect of RAAS
inhibition on fibrinolysis remain conflicting.10,11 This could
be partially attributed to the fact that patients included in
these studies are characterized by several phenotypes as
well as various level of RAAS activation, which may lead
to a different response to specific treatments. Moreover,
markers used to evaluate fibrinolysis do not always reflect
the endothelial fibrinolytic potential. Indeed, the TRAIN
study failed to show any effect on plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels induced by a one-year
treatment with fosinopril. However, the study included
patients with a high cardiovascular risk profile, suffering
from comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and cancer
that are known to decrease fibirinolytic capacity.12
Evidence on the improvement of endothelial function
by antihypertensive drugs remains inconclusive.13,14
Fibrinolytic capacity, sTM and vWf, which were evaluated
in our study, represent three different aspects of endothelial
function that are not regulated by the same metabolic and
release mechanisms.15,16 High vWf levels are an early
marker of endothelial dysfunction and correlate with over-
all cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.2 Scientific
data concerning the relationship between levels of circulat-
ing sTM and endothelial function are less consistent, how-
ever.17,18 While experimental data have shown that the
release of TM parallels the extent of cell damage, clinical
data remain conflicting. In the ARIC study, individuals
whose sTM levels were in the highest quintile had a signifi-
cant reduction of cardiovascular risk compared with those
in the lowest quintile.18 It could be hypothesized that

increased sTM levels might demonstrate their intact release
from the endothelial cells while decreased sTM levels
could be due to their consumption after thrombin binding in
cases of excessive thrombin generation.
In our study population, stable levels of D-dimers, TAT,
and PF1+2 before and after treatment demonstrate that there
was no increase in thrombin generation at baseline and
therefore no sTM consumption. It may be also assumed that
the level of endothelial dysfunction characterizing our
hypertensive patients is not sufficient to impair the
antithrombotic and anticoagulant effects of sTM. However,
we measured a further increase of sTM levels after antihy-
pertensive treatment. Whether this increase could be attrib-
uted to the pleiotropic effects of antihypertensive agents
remains to be studied. On the other hand, the simultaneous
increase of sTM and vWf might reflect hypertensive disease
progression and failure of the antihypertensive treatment to
exert a beneficial effect on these facets of endothelial func-
tion. It should be noted that evidence regarding the effect of
antihypertensive treatment on endothelial functional indices
is scarce while it seems that the effect on vWf and sTM
levels is rather neutral.13,19 Nevertheless, our results need to
be confirmed in a larger group of hypertensive patients.
Biomarkers of endothelial function have been associated
with subclinical target organ damage (TOD) due to hyper-
tension, representing either endothelial dysfunction (bra-
chial artery flow-mediated dilation) or increased arterial
stiffness (pulse wave velocity).20 In a recent study, which
included 46 never-treated hypertensive patients, vWF and
sTM levels were significantly higher in hypertensives than
in normotensive controls but only vWF was an independent
determinant of arterial stiffness.21 On the other hand, long-
term treatment with antihypertensive drugs targeting the
RAAS, i.e. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor block-
ers (ARBs), improves TOD. Indeed, RAAS antagonists
lead to a reduction in arterial stiffness, improvement in
endothelial dysfunction and regression of left ventricular
hypertrophy, independent of the level of BP decrease.22
It has been reported that exercise can transiently increase
the risk of acute ischaemic events, especially in high-risk
patients, and that the risk seems to correlate with exercise
intensity and duration.23 In our study, treated hypertensive
patients did not exhibit a hypercoagulable state after a bout
of submaximal exercise. We should stress that the BP
response during exercise was not exaggerated (no one had a
systolic BP response above 160 mmHg). This is probably
due to the fact that exercise was submaximal and the patients
were well treated. However, when these patients were newly
diagnosed, a small increase of thrombin generation associ-
ated with a mild increase in fibrin formation was evidenced
by the increase of PF 1+2 and D-dimer levels, respectively.
Conversely, fibrinolysis was highly influenced in both
exercise sessions. The plasmin­antiplasmin complex
reflects plasmin formation and has a half-life of about 120
min. Even though the fibrinolytic capacity of endothelium
was not measured directly, PAP complex represents the
total fibrinolytic potential which is practically endothe-
lium-driven. 16 It holds true that all biomarkers of fibrino-
lytic status have different limitations. Free tPA released into
blood from endothelial cells has a short half-time and rap-
idly forms a complex with circulating PAI-1. Therefore,
tPA antigen measures mainly inactive tPA/PAI-1 com-
plexes. Moreover, measurement of plasma PAI-1 does not
reflect the available PAI-1 because platelets contain
approximately 90% of the total amount of PAI-1. Besides,
it is still not clear whether total antigen or activity measure-
ments better reflect the physiological situation.24
In our study, PAP complex was found to be increased at
peak exercise and to remain elevated post-exercise.
Exercise-triggered generation of plasmin in treated patients
occurred in the absence of fibrin formation, indicating
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced rather than
thrombin-induced fibrinolysis activation.25­27 It has been
previously shown that in non-treated hypertensive patients
tPA activity was higher immediately after exercise but
returned to resting levels within 30 min whereas decrease
of PAI-1 antigen occurred only after 30 min.28 According to
our results, exercise-stimulated tPA release is not impaired
in hypertensive patients and this could have a protective
role for acute cardiovascular events during exercise. Indeed,
the ability of the endothelium to rapidly release tPAthat can
reach the thrombus in an active and unbound state is critical
for the fibrinolytic process.29
Exercise-induced endothelium activation was also evi-
denced by increases of the same magnitude of vWf antigen
levels during both exercise sessions. Exercise promotes
release of catecholamines which are known to trigger the
activation of endothelial cells and raise vWF plasma levels
acutely owing to exocytosis from Weibel Palade bodies.30
Increase of vWf following an acute moderate or maximal
exercise in healthy individuals has been demonstrated in
various studies,31­35 while in patient population data are
less consistent.36­39 It has been shown that acute intense
exercise enhances shear-induced vWf binding to glycopro-
tein platelet 1b (GP1b) receptors, as well as platelet activa-
tion,32,33 while acute moderate exercise suppressed these
events.34 Moreover, results from experimental studies in
cultured endothelial cells suggest that NO, whose bioavail-
ability increases during exercise training, is a possible
inhibitor of endothelial vWF secretion.40­42 Further studies
are needed in order to clarify whether exercise-related vWf
release in hypertensive patients merely reflects the capacity
of a healthy endothelium to respond to stress stimuli or
whether it is another facet of a prothrombotic state that
could be reversed by regular exercise training.
The sTM pathway was not activated during exercise,
either before or after the treatment period. Scarce data exist
on exercise-mediated changes in sTM levels. However, it
seems that exercise intensity levels and mechanical factors
may be involved in exercise-induced increases in sTM
328 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)
levels. It has been shown that one hour of maximal speed
running, but not swimming or cycling, significantly
increased sTM levels in male athletes.35,43
P-Selectin is localized in the membranes of platelet a-gran-
ules and in Weibel Palade bodies of endothelial cells and
mediates adhesion among leukocytes, platelets and endothe-
lium. Raised levels of its soluble form imply platelet activa-
tion.44 Available evidence suggest that short-term strenuous,
but not moderate, exercise induces transient platelet aggrega-
tion, adhesiveness and platelet secretory activity.32­34,45,46
However, in our study, moderate-intensity exercise in hyper-
tensive patients, either un-treated or on antihypertensive treat-
ment, did not manage to increase sPsel secretion.
Study limitations
One of the major limitations of this study is the relatively
small number of patients. Additionally, since HCTZ was part
of antihypertensive therapy in two-thirds of the study group,
our results may be influenced by HCTZ co-administration.
We should also state that endothelial fibrinolytic potential
was only indirectly measured, as t-PA and PAI-1 were not
evaluated in this study. However, the fact that fibrinolytic
activity is our main interest in this study, may compensate for
the indirect estimation of endothelial fibrinolytic potential by
PAP levels. Finally, our study included middle-aged, non-
diabetic subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
Therefore our findings may not be applicable to elderly
hypertensive patients with more severe hypertension or with
other co-morbidities.
In conclusion, in newly diagnosed, never-treated hyper-
tensive patients, a small increase in thrombin generation
and fibrin formation is evidenced as a response to an acute
bout of submaximal exercise. Long-term treatment with
ramipril seems to have a favourable impact on exercise-
induced haemostatic response. The activation of the hae-
mostatic system is attenuated while the endothelial
fibrinolytic potential is unaffected, rapidly available after
stimulus and preserved for at least one year after the initial
diagnosis of hypertensive disease and treatment initiation.
Increased fibrinolytic activity and endothelial activation
are the dominant features of the submaximal exercise-
induced haemostatic response in treated hypertensive
patients, but their clinical relevance has not yet been clari-
fied. It may be of interest to investigate the changes in hae-
mostatic response to exercise after a longer period of
training, as well as antihypertensive treatment.
