Introduction
This article undertakes a critical review of Malawi's experi-
ence with decentralized natural resources management as a
new orthodoxy strategy to achieving sustainable governance
of natural resources and institution of local democratic gov-
ernance (Adhikari, 2001; Ribot & Larson, 2005). It is moti-
vated by the fact that since 1980s, devolution of responsibility
and control over natural resources from central government
to user groups has become a widespread policy in many
developing countries, including Malawi (Meinzen-Dick,
Raju, & Gulati, 2000; Shah, van Koppen, Merrey, de Lange,
& Samad, 2002; Zuka, 2013).According to Ribot and Larson
(2005), at least 60 countries now claim to be decentralizing
natural resource governance for economic, social, and politi-
cal reasons. Founded on the rationality of citizen participa-
tion and democracy, devolution policies have not only
challenged the morality of centralized systems of resource
governance as theorized by Hardin (1968) but also ques-
tioned its very efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability.
Democracy literature, in particular, presents decentralization
as a tool to achieving the trinity goals of good governance,
development, and poverty reduction. The drive for decentral-
ization is also strengthened by disappointing record of cen-
tralized development planning and justified on the basis that
political governance cannot be separated from economic
governance (Bradhan, 2002; Lee, 2002). In general, devolu-
tion policies contest the state's incentives and capability to
manage local natural resources efficiently, sustainably, and
equitably (Agrawal, 2001; Meinzen-Dick et al., 2000). Inter
alia, empirical evidence revealed that state management of
natural resources has been characterized by limited respon-
siveness to the needs of local communities, increased social
and economic inequality among local communities, destruc-
tion of indigenous natural resource management knowledge,
and lack of downward accountability in resource use (Lee,
2002). Thus, participatory school of thought particularly
advocates reducing the size of government by decentralizing
management of common pool resources to local communi-
ties (Meinzen-Dick et al., 2000; Restrepo, Vermillion, &
Munoz, 2007).
Current policy shifts toward decentralized democratic
natural resource governance in developing countries are,
however, implemented against a long legacy of autocratic
rule from both state and traditional actors (Mamdani, 1996).
According to Mamdani (1996), since independence, man-
agement of natural resources was grabbed by the state and
traditional authorities in what he calls "bifurcated" approach
(see also Blaikie, 2006). Thus, institutional engineering to

Contesting Institutional Engineering
for Decentralized Natural Resource
Governance in Malawi
Sane Pashane Zuka1
Abstract
In line with 1993/1994 political change from autocratic to democratic rule in Malawi, centralized natural resources management
has been replaced by decentralized approaches. Decentralized natural resource governance, however, requires transfer of
responsibility and control over resources to locally elected actors. Using Domasi and Njala irrigation schemes, this study
explores the processes and outcomes of institutional engineering that was considered prerequisite for the establishment of
local governance in Malawi. The study findings reveal that decentralization is predominantly a political activity; hence, the
transition to decentralization cannot be a matter of just passing democratic legislation. Consequently, mere institution of
democratic structures does not automatically lead to achievement of democratic governance as was theorized.

emancipate local communities from the autocratic tenden-
cies of the state as well as undemocratic traditional actors has
been the primary task in the process of establishing commu-
nity-based natural resources management (CBNRM; Blaikie,
2006; Meinzen-Dick et al., 2000; Ntsebeza, 2005). However,
while theoretical claims predict a successful decentralized
natural resources management, empirical evidences from
both local and international CBNRM projects have high-
lighted mixed outcomes. While some are more optimistic
(Agrawal, 2001; Katz, 2002; Ostrom, 2000), others strongly
argue that its outcomes remain disappointing (Blaikie, 2006).
To what extent then do the theoretical claims about the suc-
cess of decentralized natural resources hold in practice? In
others words, has institutional engineering failed to institute
democratic natural resource governance?
Employing the lens of state­society relations, especially
formal­informal institutional interaction model, this study
responds to these questions by examining the challenges
associated with the process of crafting institutional frame-
work and governance structures for decentralized natural
resource governance. Using Domasi and Njala Irrigation
schemes as case studies, the study's crucial questions to be
addressed are as follows: What were the guiding principles
in crafting rules to guide resource use in the two irrigation
schemes? To what extent has the current attempts at demo-
cratic natural resource governance managed to emancipate
local communities from the control of the state and tradi-
tional actors? and What institutional forces explain the con-
dition of decentralized resource governance at the two sites?
In general, therefore, the study intends to explore the ade-
quacy of the formulated democratic institutions in achieving
the objectives of good natural resource governance as mea-
sured by the following variables:
·
· Access and equity: fair distribution and allocation of
resources--irrigation plots and water resources.
·
· Transparency and accountability: the imperative to
make elected leaders answerable for their public
behavior as well as responsive to the entity from
which they derive their authority. It includes the distri-
bution of power and status among local farmers as
evidenced by participation in decision making and in
elections, observance of resource users' rights, and
respect for resource users' democratic views.
·
· Predictability and rule of law: the existence of laws,
regulations, and policies to regulate society and their
fair and consistent application to resource use.
·
· Conflict resolution: air handling and resolving of con-
flicts and disputes over resources among resource
users and other surrounding local and national entities
and actors.
There is a growing literature on decentralized natural
resource governance internationally and locally (see Blaikie,
2006; Ferguson & Mulwafu, 2004; Zuka, 2013). However,
most of these studies have concentrated on the historical evo-
lution and outcomes of CBNRM and not the theoretical anal-
ysis guiding the evolution. In particular, the theoretical
dilemma and outcomes of the interaction between, first, state
and society, and formal and informal institutions after policy
shift have not been adequately explored. This gap makes this
study unique.
Conceptualizing Decentralization
Decentralization is a complex process with numerous and at
times confusing definitions (Adamolekun, 1991; Smoke,
2003). Broadly defined, decentralization is the transfer of
political, administrative, and legal authority, or responsibil-
ity for planning, decision making, resource allocation, and
administering public functions from the central government
to its field, district, and regional administrative units; semi-
autonomous and parastatal organizations or even nongovern-
mental organizations (NGOs) or voluntary associations of
people; and private entities (see Adamolekun, 1991; Smoke,
2003). Generally, there are four forms of decentralization
classified based on their objectives, namely, political, admin-
istrative, spatial, and market (Cohen & Peterson, 1996;
Smoke, 2003). Political decentralization, which is largely the
focus of this article, is concerned with transfer of decision-
making power to lower level of government units or to citi-
zens or their elected representatives. A good example of
political decentralization is devolution, which refers to trans-
fer of governance responsibility for specified functions to
subnational levels outside the direct control of the central
government (Adamolekun, 1991). Administrative decentral-
ization, divided into deconcentration and delegation, is the
hierarchical and functional distribution of powers and func-
tions between central government and noncentral govern-
ment. Deconcentration is the transfer of administrative
responsibility for specified functions to lower levels within
the central government bureaucracy (Tambulasi & Kayuni,
2007). In other words, it is the redistribution of government
administrative responsibility within central government min-
istries or agency and involves sharing central government
with offices outside the national capital. In a deconcentra-
tion, local staffs do not possess any authority to make deci-
sion on their own, but are under the technical supervision and
control of the central government. Delegation is the transfer
of government decision making and responsibilities to orga-
nizations and institutions, which enjoy varying degrees of
autonomy vis-à-vis central government ministries such as
parastatal or public corporations (Adamolekun, 1991; Cohen
& Peterson, 1996). Spatial decentralization entails efforts at
reducing excessive urban concentration in a few large cities
by promoting regional growth poles that have potential to
become centers of manufacturing and agricultural marketing
(Cohen & Peterson, 1996). Market decentralization focuses
on shifting the responsibility of providing public goods from
the state to private firms, community groups, cooperatives,
Zuka 3
and NGOs. It is broadly perceived as the creation of condi-
tions that allow goods and services to be produced and pro-
vided by market mechanisms sensitive to the preferences of
individuals. This form of decentralization has become preva-
lent with global establishment of liberalization and privatiza-
tion policies (Adamolekun, 1991).
Merits and Demerits of Decentralization:
Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives
Decentralization is, inter alia, justified based on its per-
ceived administrative, political, and economic benefits.
Administrative objectives are mainly concerned with the best
approach to organizing development activities to achieve
administrative convenience and efficiency. The former cen-
ters on making appropriate decision, whereas the latter is
about best resource allocation. The argument is that local
governments are better placed to achieve administrative con-
venience and efficiency than central government because
they are closer to local communities; thus, they can be more
sensitive in the identification of development priority needs.
From an economic perspective, local governments are
regarded to be in a better position to raise local revenue to
implement local projects as local communities will be moti-
vated to fund and monitor their own development cause
(Adamolekun, 1991; Smoke, 2003). The major political
objective of decentralization is the achievement of good and
democratic governance. Good governance signifies creation
of proper law and order, elimination of unnecessary govern-
ment interference, and establishment of corrupt free public
administration as a means of achieving socioeconomic prog-
ress (Grindle, 2004; Sharma, 2007). Democratic governance,
on the contrary, refers to the recognition of political, civil
rights, and citizen participation as basic values and develop-
ment end in themselves (Abdellatif, 2003; Elahi &
Danapoulos, 2004; Waheduzzaman, 2010). Suffice to men-
tion that, depending on their aims, different actors vary in
their orientations to these two concepts, preferring to use
either good governance or democratic governance.
The economic objective of decentralization centers
around three things, namely, economic efficiency, resource
mobilization, and service and product quality. The under-
standing is that economic efficiency is increased as citizens
become committed to development plans they have been
involved in identification. Resource mobilization, on the
contrary, is improved as people become motivated and will-
ing to contribute to local development programs. Finally,
quality of service and product increases as a result of compe-
tition and choice among local government units. The assump-
tion is that citizens would choose where to locate themselves
to take advantage of the quality and cost differentials
(Adamolekun, 1991; Smoke, 2003). It should, however, be
pointed out that the administrative, political, and economic
objectives of decentralization can hardly be fully achieved in
isolation. It is also strongly argued that implementing devo-
lution on its own strengthens top-down political dominance.
This recognition, therefore, calls into question the kind of
decentralization that can be implemented to achieve decen-
tralized natural resource governance.
Theoretical arguments for decentralization notwithstand-
ing, increased literature has shown that decentralization is
not a panacea to all challenges of economic development.
First, decentralization has inherent theoretical flaws in
accounting for its benefits, especially when applied to devel-
oping countries. Decentralization also has the potential of
promoting a sense of locality or regional belonging resulting
in heightened tribal and neopatrimonial tendencies
(Adamolekun, 1991; Smoke, 2003). In Malawi, this outcome
is faulted on its potential to cement already hostile ethnic and
regional groupings prevalent in the country; and continue to
provide a platform for tribal neopatrimonial tendencies.
Second, conditions within developing countries do not allow
full enjoyment of the benefits provided by decentralization.
For instance, high poverty levels in most countries limit pref-
erence differentiation, making the question of administrative
efficiency irrelevant. Equally important, the economic objec-
tive of quality service provision is defeated by the fact that
costs in developing countries are not related to competing
local governments, and citizens do not really have choice of
jurisdiction (Adamolekun, 1991; Smoke, 2003). In addition
to these two theoretical and conditional blocks, decentraliza-
tion suffers from design and implementation problems such
as budget deficits, fiscal irresponsibility, and local elite cap-
ture of the development agenda (Smoke, 2003). The crucial
question for this study is the extent to institutional engineer-
ing for decentralized resource governance has provided
answers to escape from these shortfalls.
Objectives of Decentralized Natural Resource
Governance
Decentralized natural resource governance has generally
four main objectives, namely, as a means to achieving
decentralization and local empowerment, as a means to
reducing government expenditure on resource management,
as a means to instituting sustainable resource use, and as a
means to reducing rampart poverty among local communi-
ties (Blaikie, 2006; Lee, 2002). Decentralized natural
resource governance as a means to achieving decentraliza-
tion and local empowerment is mainly supported by interna-
tional organizations and financial institutions that perceive
participation as a sure way to local empowerment. To this
end, processes of decentralizing natural resource gover-
nance have involved radical institutional reform in line with
the principles of democracy and decentralization. Political
decentralization involving establishment of institutions of
elected representatives is seen as a precondition for achiev-
ing local democratic governance (Ribot, 2004). Democracy
4 SAGE Open
literature, in particular, presents decentralization as a good
tool to achieving the trinity of good governance, develop-
ment, and poverty reduction. This view is reinforced by the
unsettled dichotomous views regarding the role of tradi-
tional and formal institutions in promoting local democracy.
Some scholars consider traditional institutions as antitheti-
cal to the development of democracy (Mamdani, 1996),
whereas others argue that traditional institutions can suc-
cessfully coexist with democratic forms of government.
There is also increased consensus among scholars that the
main impetus toward decentralization came from the fiscal
crisis of the state (Blaikie, 2006). Global economic crisis
especially in the early 1980s resulted in governments failing
to meet the costs of monitoring resource use and maintain-
ing resource facilities.
Decentralized natural resource governance as a means to
instituting sustainable utilization of local resources rose from
a growing realization that state management of natural
resources has been unsuccessful (Blaikie, 2006; Zuka, 2013).
It is generally designed to achieve resource sustainability
through social and economic incentives to local users who
have for long time been blamed for resource depletion and
destruction. Rather than being new, decentralized resource
governance is a modern attempt to revive the traditional
institutionalized mechanisms for managing and conserving
the natural environment (Kellert, Mehta, Ebbin, &
Lichtenfeld, 2000). The new approach is uphold by the evi-
dence that local people have the capacity to manage their
common pool resources efficiently, sustainably, and equita-
bly (Katz, 2002; Ostrom, 2000). It is enforced by the theo-
retical shifts in the game theories and democratic governance,
though practice is largely driven by the latter (Agrawal,
2001; Blaikie, 2006).
Last, there are widespread claims, especially among
development practitioners, that the main objective of
decentralized natural resource governance is poverty
reduction of the local people. This objective has gained
ground with the present understanding that poverty does
not only relate to lack of physical assets but also social
and political capacity (Lee, 2002). In other words, the
approach improves the local people's well-being physi-
cally, socially, and politically through improving their
access to resources, social interaction, and good local
governance, respectively. Thus, the drive for decentraliza-
tion is justified on the basis that political governance can-
not be separated from economic governance (Bradhan,
2002; Ribot, 2004). There is, however, a growing skepti-
cism about the real objectives of decentralized natural
resource governance. A number of scholars argue that
decentralized natural resource governance is a ploy to
pacify local communities into accepting the broader aim
of protecting local resources from which they would con-
tinue to be excluded (Blaikie, 2006; Ferguson & Mulwafu,
2007; Musumali, Larsen, & Kaltenborn, 2007).
Theoretical Context
Case Study Background Information
Historically, Malawi inherited and continued with strong
state intervention into natural resources management as
backed by the colonial legacy that doubted the ability of
local communities to efficiently manage their resources
(Ferguson & Mulwafu, 2004; see also Fairhead & Leach,
1995). Thus, most natural resources, including forests, wild
life, and water resources, were brought under direct state
control. In the case of irrigation water management, all for-
mal public irrigation schemes were strictly put under state
management. However, a plethora of factors, including
financial constraints, rendered state management of public
irrigation schemes inefficient and ineffective (Blaikie, 2006;
Veldwisch, Bolding, &Wester, 2007; Zuka, 2013). Thus, in
line with global political moves toward decentralization and
public participation in resource management, the
Government of Malawi (GoM) promulgated policy legisla-
tion for community management of irrigation of public irri-
gation schemes. The National Irrigation Policy and
Development Strategy (GoM, 2000) and Irrigation Act
(GoM, 2001), in particular, reflect this goal by "promoting
full ownership of public irrigation schemes by the beneficia-
ries through their legally constituted local organizations that
will oversee all matters related to operation and mainte-
nance of these schemes" (GoM, 2000, p. 7). Likewise, the
Irrigation Act (2001) vests legal authority in a group of
small-scale farmers to own, use, and maintain the schemes.
The formulation of management structure in the irrigation
sector was aimed at decentralizing and restructuring water
resource governance to cut off dictates of the state and its
agencies, especially local chiefs. The course taken was
based on the understanding that in Malawi, and many other
countries in Africa, traditional authorities have been histori-
cally undemocratic, unaccountable, and autocratic agents of
the state (see Ferguson & Mulwafu, 2004; Mamdani, 1996;
Ntsebeza, 2005). Thus, local chiefs were barred from active
involvement in the management of irrigation scheme.
Instead, the schemes are managed by individuals elected
among the community members. This view was premised
on the idea that institutional arrangement that is led by
elected leaders would lead to institution of democratic
governance.
Thus, the most debatable aspect of institutional engineer-
ing for decentralized natural resource governance in Malawi
is whether the exclusion of the state and traditional leaders for
elected leaders have resulted in the establishment of demo-
cratic natural resource governance. In Malawi, local chiefs
have been the state's trusted agent and have been actively
involved in natural resources management (see Blaikie, 2006;
Ferguson & Mulwafu, 2004). During one-party autocratic
rule, in particular, local chiefs were actively involved in the
management of public irrigation schemes. Thus, this study
Zuka 5
also addresses the unsettled debate of whether traditional
institutions are antithetical to development of democracy
(Mamdani, 1996) or support democracy (United Nations
Economic Commission forAfrica [UNECA], 2007). It should
be pointed that the context for decentralized natural resources
management in Malawi reveals a gamut of local and external
actors, namely, elected leaders, traditional leaders, local com-
munities, and the state. Thus, the new institutional arrange-
ment presents a potential conflict between the state and
traditional leaders, on one hand, and new elected Water User
Association (WUA) leaders, on the other.
State­Society Relations and Formal­Informal
Institution Interaction Model
It is against the backdrop that regime change in natural
resources management changes the state­society relations
that this study adopts the theory of state­society relations
and formal­informal interaction model. State­society rela-
tions is defined as
interactions between state institutions and societal groups to
negotiate how public authority is exercised and how it can be
influenced by people. They are focused on issues such as defining
the mutual rights and obligations of state and society, negotiating
how public resources should be allocated and establishing
different modes of representation and accountability. (Department
for International Development [DFID], 2010, p. 15)
Broadly, there are two main assumptions within state­soci-
ety relations. The first assumption views state and society as
dichotomous and mutually exclusive, whereas the second
assumption perceives the relations as an aggregation of the
inherently unproblematic spheres (Seller, 2010). According
to Seller (2010), state is an "institutionalized collective
power superordinate to other organizations that is sovereign
vis a vis other states, autonomous or distinct from the rest of
society, and identified socioculturally with a national collec-
tivity" (p. 4). Society, on the contrary, is defined as a condi-
tion of living in association or an organized community
(Mitchneck, 2011). The relevancy of this framework to this
study is that institutional engineering restructures arrange-
ments under which these relations operate, thus potentially
bringing tension and negotiations between the two actors.
The two major assumptions guiding state­society rela-
tions are explored further within the formal­informal institu-
tional interaction model. According to Helmke and Levitsky
(2004), formal­informal interaction model explains the
nature and outcomes of interaction between formal and
informal institutions. Institutions are rules of the game or
humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction in
society (Knowles, 2006). Formal­informal interaction model
focuses on the nature of relationships between formal and
informal institutions and their outcomes. In the case of this
study, the relationships are between elected WUA leaders, on
one hand, and the traditional and religious leaders, on the
other hand.
The formal­informal institution interaction model reso-
nates very well with institutional context created in institut-
ing decentralized natural resource governance in the
irrigation sector in Malawi. From the perspective of develop-
ment practitioners, existence of democratic management
structure project a positive-sum game with regard to achiev-
ing local democratic governance (GoM, 2000, 2001). This
view is, however, theoretically simplistic. Although institu-
tional theory can help understand the outcomes of decentral-
ized natural resource governance, it is limited in a historical
context where neither formal nor informal institutions exists
in isolation (Mamdani, 1996). Again, there is a strong belief
that many rules of the game that structure and guide people's
life are informal institutions that are created, communicated,
and enforced outside officially sanctioned channels (Helmke
& Levitsky, 2004; Knowles, 2006). Thus, formal­informal
interaction model is critical to explaining interaction between
the formal and informal institutions and also state­society
actors. The application of this model is empirically supported
by Meinzen-Dick et al. (2000), who noted that collective
action for natural resource management does not necessarily
require a formal organization.
Informal institutions are defined as socially shared rules,
usually unwritten, that are created, communicated, and
enforced outside officially sanctioned channels, whereas
informal institutions are rules and procedures that are cre-
ated, communicated, and enforced through channels widely
accepted as official. In the case of natural resource gover-
nance, this mainly relates to state recognized constitutions,
laws, regulations, and organization rules (Helmke &
Levitsky, 2004; Knowles, 2006). Generally, formal­informal
interaction model bridges the dichotomous functional­dys-
functional view about informal institutions (see Ntsebeza,
2005). The model proposes four typologies of informal insti-
tutions based on convergence and divergence of institutional
outcomes and effectiveness of formal institutions, namely,
complementary, accommodating, substitutive, and compet-
ing. Complementary informal institutions combine effective
formal rules and convergent outcomes and fill the formal
institutional gap. Accommodating informal institutions com-
bine effective formal institutions and divergent outcomes by
creating incentives to alter the outcomes of formal rules.
Substitutive informal institutions combine ineffective formal
institutions and compatible outcomes. Competing informal
institutions combine ineffective formal rules and divergent
outcomes, producing competing informal institutions such as
clientelism, patrimonial, clan politics, and corruption (Merry,
1988). This model is relevant in the explaining outcomes of
natural resource governance in areas experiencing power and
responsibility transfer from government to communities. In
Malawi, devolution of responsibility from government to
local farmers has been associated with establishment of for-
mal rules and regulations that are formally recognized by the
6 SAGE Open
state (Ferguson & Mulwafu, 2004). However, informal
actors are having a lot of influence at a local level (Zuka,
2013). Therefore, as theorized in the Helmke and Levitsky,
the success of the community management of irrigation
schemes depends on the complex interaction between formal
and informal institutions within the broader state­society
relations.
Method
This study was conducted in two smallholder irrigation
schemes of Domasi and Njala in Southern Malawi. Domasi
scheme is 500 ha while Njala scheme is 45 ha. Both irriga-
tion schemes grow rice during rainy and dry seasons. The
two areas were considered appropriate for this study because
of two reasons. First, both of them were under state manage-
ment and have devolved management responsibility to farm-
ers following the promulgation of the 2001 Irrigation Act.
Thus, they present good examples of natural resources under
elected local actors. Second, their institutional arrangement
fit into the analytical design for assessing decentralized natu-
ral resource governance as they have both formally formu-
lated local democratic constitutions. There are 1,560 and 240
irrigation farmers at Domasi and Njala irrigation schemes,
respectively.
This study adopted both quantitative and qualitative
approaches to investigate the processes and outcomes of
institutional engineering for decentralized natural resource
governance in Malawi. Quantitative data were used to
explain quantitative trends such as number of plots owned by
farmers. The qualitative approach was employed in collect-
ing data relating to examining the processes of crafting insti-
tutional framework for decentralized natural resource
governance; and assessing performance challenges associ-
ated with this framework. Qualitative approach is also ideal
in examining the complex institutional interaction between
state and society; and between formal and informal institu-
tions. In this study, formal institutions refer to a set of rules
and regulations guiding decision about resource use, alloca-
tion, and control as outlined in the WUA constitution.
Informal institutions, on the contrary, refer to resource gov-
ernance rules, regulations, and practices outside the WUA
constitution. Most of these informal institutions are deeply
rooted in local tradition (see Kambewa, 2005). Thus, WUA
leaders were grouped as formal actors, whereas traditional
and religious leaders grouped as informal actors.
The primary data were collected through key informant
interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), and household
survey. Key informant interviews were held with purposively
selected respondents from WUA leaders, local chiefs, faith
leaders (Sheikhs and Christian Pastors), and government offi-
cials. A total of eight FGDs were conducted with irrigation
farmers at both Domasi and Njala irrigation schemes. Key
informant interviews and FGDs were specifically designed to
assess the interaction between irrigation farmers, traditional
leaders, WUA executive members, and government officials.
The discussions were also designed to assess institutional per-
formance in terms of regulating access to resource and its
efficient use. The study surveyed and interviewed a total of
106 and 50 households at Domasi and Njala, respectively.
These households were selected using simple random sam-
pling, and semistructured questionnaires were used to collect
data. The household survey was aimed at assessing farmers'
mode and equality of access to irrigation plots and water
resource. Furthermore, the study employed participant and
field observation in which a number of WUA meetings were
attended to understand the nature of interaction between
WUA leaders, local chiefs, and farmers.
Empirical Findings
Institutional Framework for Irrigation Scheme
Management: Crash of Interest
Both Domasi and Njala Irrigation schemes are managed by
WUA comprising different committees, namely, the
Executive, Discipline, Health, Water, Finance, Auditing,
Marketing, and Environment. According to the constitutions
of the two irrigation schemes, WUA leaders are elected at a
general meeting every 3 years and that every legitimate
member of the association is allowed to stand for any post
except for the posts of chairperson, secretary, and treasurer,
which are reserved for people who know how to read and
write. However, the findings of this study revealed that the
process of electing leaders has been marred by a lot of irregu-
larities largely emanating from the unconstitutional agree-
ments between local chiefs and the elected WUA leaders.
First, elections are not regularly conducted as the last one
was held in 1999 and at a time of this study, farmers doubted
the probability of holding elections soon. This status quo is
uphold by the support from traditional chiefs and religious
leaders who argue that elections are not needed as they do
not have problems with the current leadership. Second, the
process of scrutinizing candidates for the top WUA positions
is less democratic. Instead, unconstitutional relations
between WUA executive members and local chiefs have cre-
ated a parallel committee for vetoing out individuals thought
to be a threat to their local relationship. Generally, local
chiefs and WUA executive take advantage of the ambiguous
constitutional requirements for individuals willing to run for
WUA elected positions, namely, good behavior; able to read
and write for the positions of president, secretary, and trea-
surer; and trustworthy and a committed local farmer. The
first step in electing leaders involves individual's declaration
of interest to stand for election. The names of interested indi-
viduals, together with a list of farmers supporting their intent,
are then forwarded to outgoing WUA executive who scruti-
nizes their names with the help of local chiefs to see whether
they qualify. After this exercise, outgoing WUA executive
releases the names of those who are going to compete for the
Zuka 7
top positions. All other positions are also supposed to be
elected during the general meeting. This procedure seems to
be democratic on face value.
However, consultations with farmers revealed that local
chiefs and influential people have a lot of influence on the
choice of leaders. For instance, consultations revealed that
some of the candidates are rejected by traditional and reli-
gious leaders on the premise that they do not have the inter-
ests of the local people at heart. The study revealed that
failure to get endorsement from the local and religious lead-
ers is enough reason for individuals to lose elections as local
farmers fear to be associated with persons not approved by
their local chiefs. In particular, farmers fear being labeled
acting against the local chiefs and those in authority. For
instance, farmers revealed that during the elections held in
1999, individuals who contested on position of president
were just dictated to irrigation farmers by the local chiefs. In
this case, those people who contest and get elected for top
positions are generally individuals favored by the local chiefs
and, therefore, elites within this social system (see also
Ntsebeza, 2004). This situation is ironically passively
accepted by the state. According to the National Irrigation
Act, the state through District Councils is responsible for
holding elections. However, the District Council is not moni-
toring the operations of the two schemes arguing there is no
need to intervene if there are no problems. This situation
underscores the need for clearly highlighting the role of the
state in enforcing institutional adherence in the process of
achieving decentralized resource governance (see Edigheji,
2007). The findings from this study, therefore, demonstrate
that while existence of democratic structures have the poten-
tial to stimulate democratic practice, state­society relations
and formal­informal interaction play a great deal in deter-
mining the ultimate outcomes.
Myths and Realities Surrounding Equitable Access
to Natural Resources
The blurred positive-sum interaction between formal­infor-
mal institutions at the two sites is made clearer when resource
distribution (irrigation plots and irrigation water) is consid-
ered. In theory, irrigation plot and irrigation water are sup-
posed to be equally shared a priori adoption of community
management. However, unclear constitutional stipulation on
important issues such as number of plots each farmer is
legally allowed to hold has resulted in high perceived cases
of neopatrimonialism. For instance, while 85% of irrigation
farmers at Domasi hold less than four plots of irrigation land
(each plot is 0.25 ha), there are about 15% of the farmers
who hold more than five to eight plots and 2.8% of the farm-
ers hold more than eight plots. Most of the people holding
more than eight plots at Domasi are leaders in WUA execu-
tive, and local chiefs and their relations. Consultations with
farmers also indicated that head irrigation plots, which
receive a lot of irrigation water, are usually allocated to WUA
executive leaders, local chiefs, and their relations, while
local farmers are allocated tail irrigation plots. The local
farmers argued that "there is favoritism in plot allocation.
Plots closer to water are usually given to individuals related
to WUA executive members and local chiefs."
It is worth pointing that regime change in irrigation man-
agement has not changed the pattern of plot ownership
(Ferguson & Mulwafu, 2007).
This study found that while irrigation plot access dispari-
ties have a long history in the one-party rule, they are cur-
rently perpetuated by social and political power relations. In
particular, plot and water allocation is highly influenced by
social and power relations that exist between WUA execu-
tive members and local chiefs. Farmers reported that rela-
tionship with local chiefs and WUA executive highly
increases individual's chances of acquiring a plot under "the
pretext of respect for our community leaders." The social
relation refers to the individual farmer's relationship with the
chiefs while the political relates to farmers' relationship with
individuals in the WUA executive. With regard to irrigation
management, the influence of local chiefs emanates from
inherent authority of controlling community social life and
social standing in the societies. It should also be pointed out
that there is weak boundary between social and political
leaders referred to herein above. This is so as there is either
strong blood relation between influential WUA executive
members and the local chiefs or the local chiefs themselves
are WUA executive members. At Njala, for instance, the vice
president of WUA is the group village head, whereas at
Domasi, the president of WUA is a brother to one of the most
influential chiefs in the area. It is, therefore, unlikely that
inequalities in irrigation plots ownership at Domasi and
Njala can be addressed by merely putting in place demo-
cratic structures. In the case of Domasi and Njala, compro-
mise between competing formal (WUA executive) and
informal (local chiefs and religious leaders) institutions is
reproducing undemocratic tendencies within the democratic
structures resulting in clientelism and patrimonialism (see
also Mamdani, 1996; Merry, 1988; Ntsebeza, 2005).
Equally important, decentralized irrigation scheme
arrangements have not resulted in efficient management of
the water resource. This is so as water is a mobile resource,
and entitlement is effective only when it is captured within
the users' resource system. In the case of Domasi and Njala,
farming activities upstream diverts a lot of water resulting in
less water reaching the two schemes. This is despite both
WUAs paying for water use withdrawal rights. This scenario
underscores the role of the state in regulating resource use
among resource users spread over a vast geographical area
and with different organizational arrangement (see Seller,
2010). According to the consultations conducted, institu-
tional gap between Domasi and Njala irrigation schemes, on
one hand, and water users upstream, on the other hand,
makes it difficult for water users to negotiate water use and
address silting up of the high stream. Findings from this
8 SAGE Open
study demonstrate that the major problem facing water use
regulation between the two schemes and farmers upstream
originates from the fact that institutional engineering was
limited to geographical area covering the scheme. This
approach ignored the fact that management of mobile
resources requires institutional framework that addresses the
resource system. Thus, decentralized resource governance
requires state­society synergy, which would allow both the
state and society to mutually benefit from each other by
reducing the cost of enforcing rules (Edigheji, 2007).
Decentralized democratic natural resource governance is
heralded as a means for poverty reduction. However, the sce-
nario at Domasi and Njala paints a doubtful picture on, first,
the extent to which decentralized natural governance can
achieve the goal of poverty reduction and, second, the extent
to which democratic institutional structure can be relied upon
in addressing resource inequalities. This is so as the absence
of the state has weakened enforcement of law, and illegal ties
between elected actors and traditional leaders have weakened
the checks and balances within the system. In the present sce-
nario, ordinary farmers cannot have no room to hold elected
leaders accountable. The challenge is that the traditional lead-
ers have long established social and cultural authority over
the affairs of the people in the area. Thus, to establish their
authority, local democratic institutions need not only the sup-
port of local informal institutions but also policy support from
the state. The current dilemma is that relations between infor-
mal institutions and formal democratic institutions quench off
public democratic consciousness cultivated through the cre-
ation of democratic institutions. For instance, interviewed
farmers in both areas indicated that they have lost trust in both
traditional leaders and elected WUA executive.
Deceptive Mechanisms for Transparency and
Accountability
Empowerment of local communities is one of the major
objectives of decentralized natural resource governance.
This involves instituting democratic resource governance
characterized by resource users' participation in decision
making, observance of resource users' constitutional rights,
and transparent and accountable management system.
Measured against these variables, there is a lack of demo-
cratic resource governance at Domasi and Njala. In terms of
resource users' participation in resource governance, 68%
and 96% of the farmers interviewed during household survey
indicated that they did not take part in the formulation of
rules governing resource use. Instead, they argued that the
rules were formulated by the WUA executive, and members
were just informed about the rules. In terms of transparency
and accountability, farmers lamented that WUA executive is
not presenting regular financial and audit reports of WUA
finance as provided for by their constitutions. In fact, at both
sites, WUA executive could not produce even a single finan-
cial audit report.
The trend of natural resource use governance at Domasi
and Njala reveals that the process of institutional engineering
was captured by a few powerful local elites. Ironically, insti-
tutional engineering at both sites was externally driven by
the state and international agencies to enforce democratic
practice. In general, establishment of formal institutions was
perceived to be prerequisite for successful decentralized
resource governance. Thus, the focus of regime change was
on formulating written constitutions for the two schemes.
However, as earlier indicated, most farmers were only
informed of the crafted constitutions. Lack of adequate farm-
ers' participation in the formulation of the constitution did
not only result into most farmers being ignorant of the con-
stitutional provisions but also sowed seeds of resentment
against the constitution. These findings reveal that mere cre-
ation of democratic arrangements was the main theoretical
flaw that was made at inception. In particular, rolling back
the state and local informal actors was considered a proper
mechanism to avoid their involvement.
However, findings of this study reveal that WUA execu-
tive and local chiefs have created power and benefit sharing
relationships that are not provided for in the constitutions.
The influence of the local chiefs on the management of irriga-
tion schemes is also enhanced by the fact that, unlike WUA
leadership, traditional authorities form part of the district
development framework as they are members of the district
development planning system. To this end, they are able to
negotiate matters relating to natural resource management
with the state in their favor. For instance, the state has still
maintained the role of local chiefs in customary land manage-
ment. Decentralized natural resource governance, therefore,
requires a holistic approach where all institutions interacting
with formally created governance institutions need to be not
only democratic but inclusive (see Manor, 2011). This institu-
tional arrangement has the potential to allow informal institu-
tions to evolve into a democracy as public consciousness for
democracy will not be suffocated by rent-seeking tenden-
cies. For instance, Shackleton, Campbell, Wollenberg, and
Edmunds (2002) found that exclusion of traditional leaders
from conservation committees in Namibia was counterpro-
ductive, resulting in conflict and delays until the chiefs were
incorporated into committees (see also Bergstrand, 2003). In
the case of this study, while decentralized resource gover-
nance can perceived to be stable at face value, it is character-
ized by a lot of reciprocity and exchange of favors that go
against the principles of a democracy. This is as leaders
(including local chiefs) have become accountable to govern-
ment and not local people (see also Manor, 2011). A good
example of these favors is a case in which a good market at
Domasi was informally but effectively restricted by WUA
executive to WUA executive members and local chiefs.
Equally important, local chiefs reported attending WUA
executive trainings and conferences not meant for them. It is
unlikely that these tendencies can be corrected without out-
side actors (preferably state) monitoring.

Compromised Mechanism for Conflict Resolution
The other rationale for devolving management of natural
resources comes from the idea that decentralized natural
resource governance reduces conflicts as resource users
collectively monitor resource use and compliance to rules.
Decentralization also makes resolution of conflicts easier
as users employ local values and norms of cooperation. Yet,
FGDs at Domasi and Njala reveal that the two sites experi-
ence a number of conflicts, including farmers' failure to
turn up for collective work at the scheme, illegal water
diversions in the scheme, and farmers' failure to clean
canals. All these conflicts point to the failure of collective
action, monitoring, and persuasion. This article argues that
these outcomes are as a result of failure to institute collec-
tive action and conflict resolution. This is so as institutional
engineering was implicitly guided by the view that putting
in place democratic arrangements and rolling back the
influence of the central government and its agents were all
that were needed to establish decentralized natural resource
governance (see Zungu, 1996). This was a misplaced prem-
ise as it undermined not only the influence of informal
institutions on formal institutions but also the need to
involve the state in enforcing democratic rules. In the case
of this study, WUA formal institutions were created parallel
to existing informal management structures controlled by
local chiefs. This arrangement created potential conflict
between local chiefs and WUA executive, making it diffi-
cult for the latter to resolve conflicts. This is confirmed by
the responses of local chiefs who indicated that they are not
happy with this arrangement. Instead, local chiefs argue
that it is unfair to leave them out of irrigation management
as they have a long history in natural resource management
(see also Fairhead & Leach, 1995). One clear example of
their role is that while WUA executive leaders have the
mandate to discipline farmers, they cannot do so without
informing and getting the consent from local chiefs. Some
offenders are also not disciplined because they are con-
nected to influential local chiefs. Revelations from Domasi
and Njala point to the idea that decentralized natural
resource governance loses a lot by neglecting traditional
structures and customary law and enforcement of laws from
the state. Mawaya (2009) argued that formal recognition of
local bylaws and rules can be useful in enforcing compli-
ance. This cannot, however, be achieved without formally
recognizing local chiefs.
Conclusions and Recommendations
This article has demonstrated that the question of instituting
decentralized democratic natural resource governance in
areas with a history of strong state management is a complex
one. This is largely so as institutional performance of the
decentralized structures depends not only on the negotiated
competing interests between the local elected and traditional
leaders but also on the policy implementation support from
the central government. Evidence from Domasi and Njala
irrigation schemes demonstrates that the promise of estab-
lishing decentralized democratic natural resource gover-
nance through democratic arrangements is not automatic.
Thus, this study underlines the need for understanding the
dynamic interaction between state and society actors (for-
mal­informal) before formulating or designing institutional
arrangements for establishing democratic natural resource
governance. In particular, understanding state­society syn-
ergy and the convergent and divergent outcomes resulting
from the influence of traditional actors on elected actors is
important in designing institutional arrangements for demo-
cratic governance.
The shift to decentralized natural resource governance is
ripe and essential taking into account the shortfalls in cen-
tralized natural resources management in Malawi, in particu-
lar, and in Africa, in general. There are currently high
theoretical expectations that, unlike the failed state's fences-
and-fines approach, decentralized natural resource manage-
ment presents the best alternative to managing these
resources. However, outcomes of decentralized irrigation
scheme management at Domasi and Njala reveal that the
positive contribution of democratic institutional structure,
while hard to refute, is challenged by a number of factors.
First, contrary to the dominant view of rolling back the state,
findings from Domasi and Njala demonstrate that there is a
need to adopt state­society synergy that is built on trust and
reciprocity. This approach is necessary if the state has to
enforce local actors' compliance to natural resources demo-
cratic policy stipulations such as holding elections for office
bearers. Second, findings from this study suggest that the
transition from centralized to decentralized natural resource
governance requires institutional engineering that can allow
democratization of local institutions (both formal and infor-
mal). To this end, the future and success of decentralized
natural resource governance depends on the extent to which
informal institutions will be allowed to evolve together with
formal institutions rather than being left out (see also
UNECA, 2007). This article, therefore, concludes that decen-
tralization is predominantly a political activity; hence, the
transition to decentralized natural resource governance can-
not be a matter of just passing democratic legislation. Equally
important, the mere institution of formal democratic struc-
tures does not automatically lead to achievement of demo-
cratic governance as was theorized.
