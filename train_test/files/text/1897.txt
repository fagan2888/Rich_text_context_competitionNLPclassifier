ABSTRACT. Objectives. To describe the sociodemo-
graphic differences among Mexican American children
(first, second, and third generation), non-Hispanic black
children, and non-Hispanic white children; to compare
the health status and health care needs of Mexican Amer-
ican children (first, second, and third generation) with
those of non-Hispanic black children and non-Hispanic
white children; and to determine whether first-genera-
tion Mexican American children have poorer health care
access and utilization than do non-Hispanic white chil-
dren, after controlling for health insurance status and
socioeconomic status.
Methods. The Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey was used to create a sample of 4372
Mexican American children (divided into 3 generational
groups), 4138 non-Hispanic black children, and 4594 non-
Hispanic white children, 2 months to 16 years of age. We
compared parent/caregiver reports of health status and
needs (perceived health of the child and reported ill-
nesses), health care access (usual source of health care
and specific provider), and health care utilization (con-
tact with a physician within the past year, use of pre-
scription medications, physician visit because of earache/
infection, and hearing and vision screenings) for
different subgroups within the sample.
Results. More than two thirds of first-generation
Mexican American children were poor and uninsured
and had parents with low educational attainment. More
than one fourth of first-generation children were per-
ceived as having poor or fair health, despite experiencing
similar or better rates of illnesses, compared with other
children. Almost one half of first-generation Mexican
American children had not seen a doctor in the past year,
compared with one fourth or less for other groups.
Health care needs among first-generation Mexican Amer-
ican children were lower, on the basis of reported ill-
nesses, but perceived health status was worse than for all
other groups. After controlling for health insurance cov-
erage and socioeconomic status, first-generation Mexican
American children and non-Hispanic black children
were less likely than non-Hispanic white children to
have a usual source of care, to have a specific provider, or
to have seen or talked with a physician in the past year.
Conclusions. Of the 3 groups of children, Mexican
American children had the least health care access and
utilization, even after controlling for socioeconomic sta-
tus and health insurance status. Our findings showed
that Mexican American children had much lower levels
of access and utilization than previously reported for
Hispanic children on the whole. As a subgroup, first-
generation Mexican American children fared substan-
tially worse than second- or third-generation children.
The discrepancy between poor perceived health status
and lower rates of reported illnesses in the first-genera-
tion group leads to questions regarding generalized ap-
plication of the "epidemiologic paradox." Given the
overall growth of the Hispanic population in the United
States and the relative growth of individual immigrant
subgroups, the identification of subgroups in need is
essential for the development of effective research and
policy. Furthermore, taking generational status into ac-
count is likely to be revealing with respect to disparities
in access to and utilization of pediatric services. Pediat-

Children living in the United States who are
Latino, including Mexicans, Puerto Ricans,
Cubans, and South Americans, are continu-
ally recognized as an underserved and high-risk
population, compared with non-Latino white chil-
dren. However, identification and discussion of
health disparities that characterize this heteroge-
neous group of children are difficult because the
Latino child health data are infrequently analyzed
according to pertinent subgroups.1 Furthermore,
studies rarely incorporate information about the
length of time immigrant families have been in the
United States, which can be associated with social
and economic risk factors that also affect health.2,3
The limited availability of subgroup- and generation-
specific data has inhibited our ability to identify the
highest-risk groups of Latino children and to de-
scribe and understand the factors that contribute to
their increased risk.
Although the growth in the Latino population in
the United States can be attributed to all subgroups,
Mexican-born immigrants constitute the largest and
fastest growing group of immigrants.4 Several stud-
ies have addressed access to and utilization of health
care services by Latino adults and children in the

United States, but few have addressed these issues
specifically for Mexican American children. Those
analyses revealed that Mexican ethnicity was an in-
dependent risk factor for being uninsured and that
Mexican American children had fewer physician vis-
its in 1 year, compared with other Latino subgroups.
However, data for immigrant or first-generation
Mexican American children are lacking.5­10
The Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES III),11 which was con-
ducted from 1988 to 1994 by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, offers the opportunity to examine
differences in health care needs, access, and utiliza-
tion for Mexican American, non-Hispanic black,
and non-Hispanic white children. Moreover, the
NHANES III is one of the few datasets that over-
sampled Mexican American children and provides
information on generational status (immigrant/first
generation, second generation, or third generation).
Although "Latino" is more widely accepted as a
descriptor for this population, we use the NHANES
descriptor "Hispanic" in this article, to maintain clar-
ity regarding the variables being discussed.
In this study, we had 3 goals, (1) to describe the
sociodemographic differences among Mexican
American children (first, second, and third genera-
tion), non-Hispanic black children, and non-Hispanic
white children; (2) to compare health status and
health care needs of Mexican American children
(first, second, and third generation) with those of
non-Hispanic black children and non-Hispanic white
children; and (3) to examine whether first-generation
Mexican American children have poorer health care
access and utilization than do non-Hispanic white
children, after controlling for health insurance status
and socioeconomic status. We hypothesized that
first-generation Mexican American children had
worse health status and greater health care needs, as
well as poorer health care access and utilization, than
did non-Hispanic white children.
METHODS
Study Sample
NHANES III constitutes a cross-sectional representative sample
of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population 2 months of
age living in households. The survey was conducted at 89 loca-
tions in two 3-year phases. The survey used stratified, multistage,
probability sampling. Weights indicating the probability of being
sampled were assigned to each respondent. Mexican Americans,
non-Hispanic blacks, children 5 years of age, and adults 60
years of age were oversampled, to provide more reliable estimates
for these groups. Household interviews with a responsible adult,
usually the head of household, provided information about family
characteristics and about each sample person, including identifi-
cation of race/ethnicity and generational status. All household
interview procedures, including interviews with English- and
Spanish-speaking respondents, were pretested, and revisions and
adjustments were made as necessary to ensure the success of the
main study.
All children 2 months to 16 years of age with interview infor-
mation were included. Our analysis sample was composed of
13 114 children, including 519 first-generation Mexican Ameri-
cans, 2257 second-generation Mexican Americans, 1606 third-gen-
eration Mexican Americans, 4138 non-Hispanic blacks, and 4594
non-Hispanic whites. Among Mexican American children, the
first-generation group included children born in Mexico with at
least 1 parent born in Mexico or another non-US country. The
second-generation group included children born in the United
States with at least 1 parent born in Mexico or another non-US
country. The third-generation group included children born in the
United States with both parents also born in the United States.
Dependent Variables
Data Source
All variables for the children were drawn from items on the
family questionnaire and household questionnaire included in
NHANES III; answers to these items were reported by the parent
or caregiver.
Health Status and Health Care Needs
Health status and health care need were assessed with 5 items.
These items addressed current perceived health of the child (di-
chotomized as poor/fair or good/very good/excellent); illnesses
during the past 12 months, including cold or flu (yes/no) and
pneumonia (yes/no); and earache/ear infection at any time in the
past (yes/no; if yes, the number of past earaches/infections was
coded as 1, 2, or 3).
Health Care Access
Health care access was assessed with 2 items, ie, usual source of
care (yes/no) and usual specific provider (yes/no). Information
on usual specific provider was available only for children who had
a usual source of care.
Health Care Utilization
Health care utilization was assessed with 4 items. The primary
item was time since last spoke to or visited a physician, catego-
rized as 1 year, 1 year or 2 years, 2 years or 5 years, or 5
years or never. Secondary items included use of prescription
medication in the past month, seen by a physician during ear-
ache/infection (if answered yes to having had an earache/infec-
tion), and time since last hearing and vision screens; these items
were dichotomous. Hearing and vision screens were included as
indicators of the use of preventive care. Children 4 to 5 years of
ages were categorized regarding whether they had ever under-
gone hearing and vision screening. Children 6 to 11 years of age
and 12 to 16 years of age were categorized regarding whether they
had undergone hearing and vision screening within the past 2
years.
Independent Variables
The primary independent variable was reported race/ethnicity
and generational status, defined as first-generation Mexican
American, second-generation Mexican American, third-genera-
tion Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, or non-Hispanic
white. Other independent variables included 6 sociodemographic
variables that are known to affect health care access and utiliza-
tion. The poverty income ratio was defined as the ratio of reported
household income to the poverty threshold in the calendar year in
which the participants were interviewed and was categorized as
1.0, 1.01 to 1.30, 1.31 to 1.85, or 1.85. The gender/marital status
of the head of household was dichotomized as single female or
otherwise. Head of household educational level was categorized
as 9 years, 9 to 12 years, or 12 years. Residence location was
dichotomized as urban (county population of 1 million) or rural
(county population of 1 million). The primary language spoken
in the home was categorized as Spanish, English, or bilingual. The
type of health insurance was categorized as private, public (Med-
icaid or Champus), or uninsured.
Statistical Analyses
The NHANES III data were weighted to account for the un-
equal probabilities of selection resulting from the survey cluster
design, oversampling of certain groups, and item nonresponse.
Prevalence estimates and stepwise logistic regression analyses
were performed with sample weights with SUDAAN, version 8.0
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC), a soft-
ware program for analysis of data from complex sample sur-
veys.12 The 5 groups of children were compared with respect to
sociodemographic variables and the health status, health care
need, access, and utilization variables with 2 tests.

e324 GENERATIONAL STATUS IN ACCESS AND UTILIZATION
To determine whether first-generation Mexican American chil-
dren were at increased risk for poor health care access and utili-
zation independent of socioeconomic status and health insurance
status, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses for
2 health care access items (usual source of care and usual specific
provider) and 1 health care utilization item (visit to a physician in
the past year). Independent variables included race/ethnicity and
generational status, age, gender, single female head of household,
head of household educational level, urban residence location,
and health insurance status. Household poverty index was with-
held from the models to avoid colinearity with other indicators of
socioeconomic status.
Stepwise logistic regression analyses began with no variables in
the model. The variable that contributed the most to the regres-
sion, as determined by the Wald statistic, and was significant at
the .15 level was added. After each new variable was added, any
variable that no longer met the criteria for significance was re-
moved. The stepwise process ended when none of the unselected
variables met the entry criteria.13
RESULTS
Group Differences
Sociodemographic Variables
As seen in Table 1, all 3 generations of Mexican
American children were more likely to live in pov-
erty than were non-Hispanic white children. The
first-generation Mexican American children were
most severely affected, with three fourths living in
households with incomes below the poverty level,
compared with one half of non-Hispanic black chil-
dren and one sixth of non-Hispanic white children.
Among Mexican American children, however, many
of the heads of households were employed. First-
and second-generation Mexican American heads of
households had similar levels of employment, and
both were higher than the level for non-Hispanic
black households. First-generation Mexican Ameri-
can children were the least likely to be in households
headed by a single female adult, but this value dou-
bled for the second- and third-generation groups and
the value was highest for non-Hispanic blacks, with
1 in 2 households being headed by a single female
adult.
Mexican American households had lower educa-
tional levels, compared with both non-Hispanic
blacks and whites, and first-generation Mexican
Americans had the lowest levels, with three fourths
reporting less than a ninth grade education. First-
generation Mexican American children were more
likely to reside in urban areas, and the percentages
were lower for second- and third-generation chil-
dren. First-generation Mexican American children
were more likely to live in households where Span-
ish was spoken as the primary language. Third-gen-
eration Mexican American children were more likely
to live in households where English was spoken as
the primary language.
Two thirds of the first-generation Mexican Amer-
ican children in our sample were uninsured. This
number was lower for second- and third-generation
children, but the third-generation children were still
twice as likely to be uninsured as non-Hispanic
white children. All 3 generations of Mexican Amer-
ican children were more likely to be covered by
public insurance than were non-Hispanic white chil-
dren. Disproportionately fewer insured first- and
second-generation Mexican American children were
covered by private health insurance, compared with
other groups.
Health Status and Health Care Needs
As seen in Table 1, greater percentages of first- and
second-generation Mexican American children were
perceived to be in fair or poor health, compared with
all other groups. The percentage of third-generation
Mexican American children perceived to be in fair or
poor health was comparable to that of non-Hispanic
black children. The percentage of first-generation
Mexican American children with reported cold or flu
in the past 12 months was lower than values for all
other groups except non-Hispanic blacks. The per-
centage of first-generation Mexican American chil-
dren with reported pneumonia in the past 12 months
was lower than values for all other groups. The
percentage of first-generation Mexican children re-
ported to ever have had an earache/infection was
also lower than values for all other groups.
Health Care Access
As seen in Table 2, first-generation Mexican Amer-
icans were the least likely to have a usual source of
care (slightly more than one half of the group). Sec-
ond- and third-generation Mexican American chil-
dren had much better access, with levels similar to
those of non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white
children. Similarly, of those reporting a usual source
of care, first-generation Mexican American children
were least likely to have a usual specific provider.
The percentages were higher for the second- and
third-generation groups, but the percentage of third-
generation children with a usual specific provider
was lower than that for non-Hispanic white children.
Health Care Utilization
As seen in Table 2, only one half of first-generation
Mexican American children had seen or talked to a
physician within the past year, compared with three
fourths of children in all other groups. Three fourths
of all first-generation Mexican American children
had not seen a physician within the past 2 years, and
one tenth had not seen a physician in 5 years.
Similarly, in almost every age cohort, first-generation
Mexican Americans were the least likely to have
used prescription medications in the past month, to
have had an ear infection and been seen by a doctor,
and to have undergone routine hearing and vision
screening.

Insurance
Health Care Access
In the stepwise logistic regression models shown
in Table 3, both first-generation Mexican American
children and non-Hispanic black children were less
likely to have a usual source of care than were non-
Hispanic white children, after controlling for several
sociodemographic variables. Younger children and
children without health insurance were also less
likely to have a usual source of care. Among those

who had a usual source of care, both first- and sec-
ond-generation Mexican American children and
non-Hispanic black children were less likely to have
a usual specific provider than were non-Hispanic
white children. Only third-generation Mexican
American children did not differ significantly from
non-Hispanic white children.
Health Care Utilization
In the logistic regression model in Table 3, and
similar to the results for health care access, first-
generation Mexican American and non-Hispanic
black children were less likely to have seen a physi-
cian in the past year than were non-Hispanic white
children, after controlling for sociodemographic vari-
ables. Younger children, children without health in-
surance, children who resided in rural areas, and
children in less-educated households were less likely
to have seen or talked with a physician within the
past year. Boys were less likely to have seen or talked
with a physician within the past year.
DISCUSSION
Although previous studies with NHANES III data
showed differences between Mexican American chil-
dren and non-Hispanic white children in many dif-
ferent areas, categorizing Mexican American chil-
dren according to generational status revealed more
marked disparities in the areas of access and utiliza-
tion. Hispanics are the largest group of minority
children in the United States, and Mexican Ameri-
cans are the largest subgroup of Hispanic immi-
grants; therefore, understanding the risk factors re-
lated to generational status is vital for clinicians,
health care institutions, and policy makers.
Our analysis showed that first-generation Mexican
American families had a greater risk burden with
respect to poverty level, educational attainment, and
language. The prevalence of these risk factors among
first-generation Mexican American children was sub-
stantial. Two thirds were living in poverty, three
fourths of the heads of household had less than ninth
grade educations, and less than one tenth used En-
glish in the household. The prevalences of poverty
and low educational level were much greater than
those reported for the greater foreign-born popula-
tion in the United States (16.1% and 21.9%, respec-
tively).14 Despite a head of household employment
rate equal to that for second-generation Mexican
Americans and higher than that for non-Hispanic
blacks, first-generation Mexican American children
were at greatest risk of being uninsured. In contrast
to other risk factors, first-generation families had the
lowest rate of single female adult-headed households
among all groups.
Immigrant children are commonly excluded from
federal health insurance programs, and Hispanic
children are consistently found to have the highest
rates of being uninsured. Most recently, the Census
Bureau reported that 24.1% of Hispanic children
were uninsured, compared with 13.9% of non-His-
panic black children, 11.7% of Asian/Pacific Islander
children, and 7.4% of non-Hispanic white children.15

panic heading eliminates country of origin as a dif-
ferentiating risk factor for being uninsured. Mexican
American children, who vary in their residential sta-
tus, are typically grouped with Puerto Rican chil-
dren, who are all US citizens, and with Cuban Amer-
icans, who may be US citizens or have refugee status.
Furthermore, the lack of data according to genera-
tional status decreases these differences, with under-
estimation of the risk of being uninsured.
In our study, first-generation Mexican American
children had the highest rate of being uninsured, ie,
64.2%, which was significantly higher than the per-
centage reported for Hispanics as a whole. Signifi-
cant differences persisted for the second- and third-
generation groups. In fact, each generational group
of Mexican American children was more likely to be
uninsured than either non-Hispanic white children
or black children. It is also interesting to note that,
among first-generation Mexican American children,
there were almost equal proportions of children with
private and public health insurance. This is not sur-
prising, because 70% of the heads of household were
employed. We suspect that a significantly greater
proportion of first-generation children could be in-
sured if their parents worked for employers who
provided health insurance. Even when insurance is
offered, however, many employed Hispanics in poor
and low-income households decline coverage be-
cause of lack of affordability.16
Previous reports that immigrant children as a
whole are less likely to have health insurance, less
likely to have a usual source of care, and less likely to
have had a doctor's visit in the past year were limited
in that they did not differentiate Hispanic subgroups
or generations.3,17 Our results confirmed that first-
generation Mexican American children had much
worse health care access than previously described
for Hispanic children as a whole. Previous studies
showed that 82% to 89% of Hispanic children had a
usual source of care.8,18 With regard to immigrant
children, one report indicated that 51% of all foreign-
born children (including Latino, white, black, and
Asian children) in working-poor families were unin-
sured and that 65% had a usual source of care. Our
results are consistent with these findings but suggest
that first-generation Mexican American children may
also fare worse than immigrant children considered
as a whole. Even when first-generation Mexican
American children were insured, they had the lowest
likelihood of having a regular source of care or a
specific provider.
First-generation Mexican American children also
demonstrated the lowest levels of utilization of
health care services, as assessed by visits to a physi-
cian, use of prescription medications, and screening
for hearing and vision problems. Poor health care
access is a known predictor of poor health care uti-
lization; however, the data also suggest that the first-
generation group might have had decreased needs.
For example, fewer reported earaches/infections in
the first-generation group and lower levels of treat-
ment for ear infections were consistent with fewer
visits to a physician for earache/infection. First-gen-
eration Mexican American children also had lower
rates of reported cold or flu, pneumonia, and ear
infections, which were consistent with lower rates of
prescription medication use.
Better health outcomes in recent immigrant popu-
lations form the basis of what has been described as
the "epidemiologic paradox." Previous studies of
perinatal outcomes showed that, despite the pres-
ence of demographic and socioeconomic risk factors,
foreign-born Mexican American women have low
birth weight infant birth rates and infant mortality
rates similar to those of white women.19 It has not
been confirmed that any advantage at birth persists
into early childhood, and study results are conflict-
ing. Previous studies suggested that Mexican Amer-
ican mothers report low rates of asthma, coordina-
tion problems, psychologic and behavioral problems,
speech problems, and mental retardation among
their children, suggesting that immigrant children
may fare better with regard to specific illnesses.20
However, a more recent study testing this hypothesis
into early childhood showed that generational status
alone accounted for lower developmental scores
among Mexican American children.21
Our findings showing lower rates of specific ill-
nesses among first-generation Mexican American
children seem to support the epidemiologic paradox,
suggesting that first-generation Mexican American
children had decreased health care needs with re-
spect to the conditions reported. This might have
translated into decreased utilization of health ser-
vices for this group. Furthermore, our findings sup-
port the theory that Mexican American children be-
come less healthy as they become more acculturated.
Subsequent generations reported higher prevalences
of the 3 illnesses tested, adding to evidence in the
literature that Hispanic immigrant children have
health outcomes and indicators that worsen with
greater acculturation and each successive genera-
tion.1
In light of what might be better outcomes for first-
generation Mexican American children, we are faced
with reconciling the fact that the same group had the
highest percentage of children reported to be in fair
or poor health. This finding is line with previous
studies,2 and there are 3 possible explanations for the
discrepancy. First, poor access to care could have
biased the group toward lower reporting of need.
(NHANES III was based on parent or guardian re-
ports and not clinician-diagnosed illness or clinic-
based utilization figures.) Second, a language bias
could have existed for the monolingual Spanish-
speakers. Although the NHANES questionnaires
were forward- and reverse-translated and adminis-
tered by bilingual interviewers, colloquial differ-
ences could have affected how the questions were
interpreted. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
recent immigrants may perceive health differently,
leading to different reporting patterns. Whether per-
ception of poor health is an indicator of undetected
disease burden or a difference in the cultural view of
illness is unknown and requires additional investi-
gation.
Indeed, culture, cultural perspective, and/or cul-
tural differences may account for a portion of the
e328 GENERATIONAL STATUS IN ACCESS AND UTILIZATION
difference attributed to generational status in this
study. One of the most studied measures of accul-
turation, namely, language, reflected the first-gener-
ation Mexican American households in this study,
with 93% being primarily Spanish-speaking. Al-
though the definitions of acculturation varied, past
studies that used language preference as a measure
of acculturation showed increased use of preventive
services and decreased perceived barriers to care for
Hispanics who spoke English.22 Our findings are
consistent with this line of thought, in that a substan-
tially higher number of first-generation Mexican
American households reported Spanish as the pri-
mary language spoken and also had lower levels of
health care access and utilization, compared with the
other groups. Because of colinearity of language and
generational status, we did not include language in
the multivariate analysis.
The language and culture of the medical office
may have disproportionate effects on utilization of
health care for first-generation immigrants. Hispanic
parents identify language problems, long waits at the
physician's office, lack of health insurance, difficulty
paying medical bills, and difficulty arranging trans-
portation as the greatest barriers to care. However,
many (10%) may not bring their children in for care
if the medical staff does not understand Hispanic
culture.23 This is an important realization that points
to systemic factors, as opposed to individual patient
factors, as causes of racial/ethnic disparities in
health care. The cultural shortcomings of clinical
staff, including lack of Spanish language proficiency,
lack of knowledge of Hispanic culture, and lack of
Hispanic staff members, cannot be underestimated.
Additional research is required to identify the spe-
cific barriers to health care access and utilization for
specific population subgroups, the benefits of a cul-
turally competent and language-friendly clinical en-
vironment, and the costs of creating and maintaining
such an environment.
Our study has certain limitations. One limitation is
that the NHANES data were collected 10 years ago
and are cross-sectional, which may limit the applica-
bility to today's population. However, it is the largest
available collection of data on Mexican American
children and one of the only datasets that allows
analysis according to generation. Although the num-
ber of Mexican American immigrant children in the
United States is significantly larger than a decade
ago, the differences in language and culture are un-
changed and the percentage of minority physicians is
unchanged. The only change in national legislation
has been in the form of tax incentives to employers
who provide health insurance for their employees.
Although the State Children's Health Insurance Pro-
gram has made an impact in enrolling minority pop-
ulations, the gains are likely to be lost as states op-
erate under budget deficits and legislatures cut
statewide programs designed to reach underserved
populations. Recently, several states extended public
insurance to nonresidents through initiatives such as
California's Healthy Kids. These programs are also
expected to suffer. NHANES IV, which is in progress
through 2004, will allow us to replicate our analysis
and to evaluate trends. A second limitation is that all
data on health care access and utilization and health
status were recorded from household interviews and
were not verified through primary health care
sources, which introduces potential bias. A third lim-
itation is that, in our analyses, we made no multivar-
iate adjustment for primary language spoken at
home, which has been shown to affect health care
outcomes. This adjustment might have had an effect
for a small subset of first-generation Mexican Amer-
ican households (3.1%) that spoke primarily English.
Finally, the race/ethnicity groupings specified in our
analysis used the categories provided in the
NHANES III dataset, ie, non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Mexican American. These cate-
gories excluded data on children coded as "other."
The sample size for this group coded as other was
too small for analytical use, and the category, which
included other Hispanics, Asians, and Native Amer-
icans, could not be labeled accurately. Overall, our
analysis is strengthened by the use of a large, nation-
ally representative dataset with oversampled minor-
ity groups and by the unique differentiation of Mex-
ican American children according to generational
status.
Most studies in pediatric health care fail to differ-
entiate between immigrant and nonimmigrant chil-
dren, despite the fact that 1 in 5 children in the
United States is an immigrant or lives in an immi-
grant family. Similarly, most studies of Hispanic chil-
dren, including studies of immigrants, fail to differ-
entiate the experience of individual ethnic groups
according to country of origin. This lack of data
leaves us with an inability to distinguish differences
in health care needs, access, utilization, and costs
between US- and foreign-born children, creating a
significant problem in terms of health care delivery
and development of public policy. More impor-
tantly, this shortcoming leaves immigrant children in
the United States at a disadvantage with regard to
health care.
Our study showed that Mexican American immi-
grant children, the largest group of immigrant chil-
dren in the United States, were not obtaining ade-
quate access to health care, despite the gainful
employment of their parents. Furthermore, the
group lacked continuity of care and was most likely
to miss preventive care services such as hearing and
vision screening. Although some of our findings sup-
ported the epidemiologic paradox, findings on pa-
rental perception of the health status of the first-
generation Mexican American children did not.
Understanding such differences between immigrant
and nonimmigrant children in the United States is
essential for improving access to and utilization of
pediatric services, especially given the overall
growth of the Hispanic population in the United
States and the relative growth of immigrant Hispanic
subgroups.
