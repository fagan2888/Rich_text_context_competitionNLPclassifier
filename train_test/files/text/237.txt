Objective: The objective of this study was to assess whether using
a condom at adolescent sexual debut is associated with an increased
likelihood of subsequent condom use.
Study Design: A nationally representative sample was used, includ-
ing 4024 sexually active adolescents (12­18 years) from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Logistic regression was used
to model the association of condom use at sexual debut on condom use
at most recent sex (mean interval, 23 months).
Results: Condom use at adolescent sexual debut was associated
with a twofold increased likelihood of condom use during most recent
sex (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.91­2.73).
Conclusions: Among adolescents, early condom use is associated
with an increased likelihood of subsequent condom use.
OVER 60% OF HIGH SCHOOL seniors in the United States have
had sexual intercourse and one third of all high school students
report sexual intercourse within the last 3 months.1 Using a con-
dom is one of the best methods for preventing the transmission of
many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including chlamydia,
gonorrhea, herpes simplex infection (HSV), and human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV).2­5 However, less than 60% of sexually
active high school students report using condoms during last
intercourse.1
Adolescents have the highest rate of STDs compared with all
other age groups: 25% of the 15 million new cases of STDs
diagnosed annually occur in teenagers.6 At least 1 in 3 sexually
active young people in the United States contract an STD by 24
years of age.6 Adolescents are at highest risk for infection because
they are more likely to be single, have multiple sex partners,
engage in high-risk behavior, and have higher rates of failure with
contraceptive methods.6,7 Adolescent females are physiologically
at higher risk for infection than older women because cervical
ectopy is most common in young women and contributes to
susceptibility of disease acquistion.8
Many safe-sex programs have been implemented that attempt to
reduce the occurrence of unprotected sexual intercourse and its
associated morbidities among teenagers. Some of these programs
have successfully increased self-reported condom use and other
forms of contraception among sexually active adolescents.9­15
Nevertheless, it is not clear whether these programs are imple-
mented early enough to instill the idea of regular condom use in
the minds of adolescents before the onset of sexual activity.16,17
This is particularly important because many young people are
sexually active for months before seeking medical care for repro-
ductive health, with as few as 40% of young women seeking health
care for contraception within 12 months after sexual debut.18
Against this background, several studies of condom use in
teenagers have found that adolescents reporting condom use dur-
ing their most recent sexual experience frequently report having
also used a condom at sexual debut.19­22 The primary goal of this
study is to assess whether the observed association between con-
dom use at sexual debut and subsequent condom use is spurious,
or if some adolescents get into the habit of using a condom from
the onset of sexual activity. Acknowledging the potential for
multiple and changing influences on condom use behavior over
time, we explore the association in a nationally representative
random sample of adolescents by adjusting for potentially con-
founding factors thought to influence condom use.
Our study is guided by a conceptual model of condom use that
incorporates multiple independent factors previously shown to
influence teenage condom use, including both stable traits and
behaviors more proximate to sexual activity (Fig. 1). In addition to
these factors, our model includes a direct effect of condom use at
sexual debut on subsequent condom use. We theorize that when a
teenager uses a condom at their sexual debut, the foundation for a
habit of condom use is established. The logic is that for adolescents
whose initial experience of sexual intercourse includes using a
condom, condoms become a routine part of sex; we expect, there-
fore, that these adolescents will be more likely to regularly use
condoms in their subsequent sexual encounters. By analogy, we
consider the use of automobile seatbelts and bicycle helmets; we
know that children trained to use these protective measures from
day 1 are more likely to continue to use them over time, because
for these children, helmets and seatbelts are an integral part of the
experience of riding in a car or on a bicycle.23,24 In contrast, adults
asked to adopt these protective measures after they are already
accustomed to riding without a seatbelt or helmet are slow to

change their behavior, and often fail to do so unless formal
sanctions are in place.25,26 Based on this theory of habit formation,
we hypothesize that although some of the observed association
between condom use at sexual debut and subsequent condom use
reflects selection effects, a strong direct effect will persist in
models that include appropriate confounding factors.
Materials and Methods
Data
We used data from wave 1 of the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is a stratified
nationally representative sample of adolescents attending high
school in the United States. Between September 1994 and April
1995, more than 90,000 students in grades 7 to 12 who attended 1
of 143 sampled schools completed a self-administered, in-school
questionnaire. These respondents were then stratified by grade and
gender and sampled to generate a core sample of approximately
12,000 adolescents for the in-home phase of the study; in addition,
Add Health oversampled various minority groups. A total of
20,745 adolescents completed the in-home questionnaires between
April and December 1995. Weighting of the full sample ensures a
nationally representative sample of 7th to 12th graders in the
United States.
Topics covered by the in-home interview included health status,
nutrition, peer networks, decision-making processes, family com-
position and dynamics, educational aspirations and expectations,
employment experience, romantic partnerships, sexual partner-
ships, substance use, and criminal activities. Interviewers used
laptop computers to record answers for the in-home question-
naires, with audio-CASI (audio-computer-assisted self-interview)
used for sensitive topics to ensure confidentiality and to minimize
parental and interviewer influence. All study participants provided
informed consent. Details of the sample design and methodology
are available at www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth/design.
Sample
Our primary analysis sample was restricted to the 4024 adoles-
cents 12 to 18 years old who reported having sexual intercourse,
defined as vaginal intercourse, at least twice and with a minimum
of 30 days separating the date of first intercourse from that of most
recent intercourse. We required this interval of at least 1 month
between encounters to avoid scenarios in which the first and last
intercourse occurred proximately (ie, during the same date). We
also constructed a subsample of respondents (n  698) for whom
we were able to match data describing their first and most recent
sexual partner.
Analysis Strategy
We began by estimating the direct effect of self-reported con-
dom use at first sex on self-reported condom use at most recent sex
in our primary sample. Then we reestimated this effect, controlling
for a broad set of potentially confounding factors. We followed a
similar strategy for our partnership sample, including characteris-
tics of the partnerships. All models were estimated using logistic
regression and corrected for Add Health's sample design by using
STATA's survey routine.
Confounding Factors
Our adjusted models include potential confounders previously
reported to influence the likelihood of condom use among adoles-
cents. We distinguish between relevant personal and demographic
characteristics that are stable over time and proximate behaviors
associated with particular sexual experiences. Stable factors are
included to distinguish those adolescents who are predisposed to
use condoms from those who are less likely to use condoms, net of
other factors. Because the proximate factors are time-varying and
dependent on the individual's experience, they could be present (or
absent) at sexual debut and absent (or present) at most recent sex.
Among stable traits, we considered gender, race,22,27­30 intelli-
gence, and socioeconomic status. Proximate factors include
age,29,31­35 risk-taking behaviors,27,34,36­38 depressive symp-

Results
Sample Descriptives
Slightly more than half of the adolescents in our primary sample
were female (53%) and the average age was 16.5 years (range,
12­18 years). Adolescents self-identified as white (65%), black
(22%), Hispanic (9%), Asian (2%), Native American (1%), or
other (1%). The population had a mean family socioeconomic
status score of 5.6 (range, 0­10) and a mean intelligence score of
101.6 (range, 13­146) as measured by the standardized Add
Health Picture Vocabulary Test. The majority (86%) reported
having received some type of sexual education (information on
pregnancy or AIDS) in school. Additional descriptive data are
reported in Table 1.
As shown in Table 1, the partnership subsample sample differs
from the main study sample in several important ways. In general,
we were only able to match partnership data for respondents who
had fewer sex partners and had been sexually active for a relatively
short period of time. Thus, the subsample is more likely to be
female, white, older at sexual debut and at most recent sex, and
more likely to report using a condom at sexual debut. They also
report a shorter time interval between first and most recent sex,
more often report using oral contraceptives at most recent sex, and
more often report feeling at risk for pregnancy and increased
personal motivation to use birth control. The subsample is less
likely to report a history of STD, risk-taking behavior, being drunk
or high at most recent sex, negative feelings, and perceived chance
of acquiring AIDS.
Multivariate Logistic Regression Model of Main Sample
Table 2 reports odds ratios (OR) from 2 models that regress
condom use at most recent sex on selected independent vari-
ables. Model 1 reports the direct unadjusted effect of using a
condom at sexual debut on the probability of using a condom at
most recent sex; consistent with other studies, we find that using
a condom at sexual debut was associated with a substantially
increased odds of using a condom at most recent sex (OR, 2.60;
95% confidence interval [CI], 2.16­3.11). Model 2 estimates

the adjusted effect; in this model, the odds ratio associated with
using a condom at sexual debut was only slightly reduced (OR,
2.28; 95% CI, 1.91­2.73). The adjusted model also shows that
being female, white, and drunk or high at most recent sex all
decrease the likelihood of using a condom at most recent sex,
whereas concern about unplanned pregnancy, high self-efficacy
regarding birth control negotiation, and high personal motiva-
tion to use birth control all increase the likelihood of using a
condom at most recent intercourse (Table 2).
Multivariate Logistic Regression Model of
Partnership Subsample
For the subsample of adolescents for whom we identified part-
ners, the adjusted model included the variables used in our anal-
yses of the main sample, as well as measures of the age difference
between partners at sexual debut and at most recent intercourse,
duration of relationships before sexual debut and most recent
intercourse, and whether the encounter was with the same partner
at sexual debut and most recent sex (see Table 1 for descriptives).
Table 3 reports the results of models estimated on our partnership
subsample. The findings from these analyses are similar to those
from the main sample. The raw odds ratio for condom use at first
sex and most recent sex in the bivariate model was 2.25 (95% CI,
1.46­3.46), and this remained relatively unchanged after adjusting
for confounders, including the partnership characteristics (OR,
2.18; 95% CI, 1.33­3.56). When controlling for condom use at
sexual debut and other potentially influential factors, none of the
partnership variables had a significant effect on the probability of
using a condom at most recent sex.
Discussion
This study examined the association between condom use at
sexual debut and subsequent condom use. We found that condom
use at sexual debut increased the likelihood of condom use at most
recent sex, and that this effect was largely independent of the
influence of stable demographic and personal characteristics and
proximate attitudinal, behavioral, and relationship factors. This
finding is consistent with the idea that early condom use could help
establish a pattern of condom use that carries forward to subse-
quent sexual activity.
As previously reported in the literature, we also find that having
high self-efficacy in terms of birth control negotiation with a
partner, personal motivation to use birth control, and concern
about unplanned pregnancy all increase a teenager's ability to plan
for and execute safe sexual practices.29,35,38,40­42
Our finding that being drunk or high at most recent sex de-
creases the likelihood of condom use is consistent with some other
studies showing that being under the influence of inhibition-low-
ering substances such as alcohol or other illicit drugs affects
judgment, decision-making, and planning and for the inexperi-
enced adolescent likely has a negative impact on condom use.37,38

CONDOM USE
Whites have been found to use condoms less often than
blacks,22,27­30 which could reflect lower perceived risk, decreased
parental communication about sexuality, or decreased education
about and promotion of safe-sex practices. Adolescent females
frequently report lower rates of condom use compared with their
male counterparts.27­30 This could reflect who their partners are,
because teenage females often have partners many years older and
these partners might not be included in adolescent study samples.
Contrary to previous reports in the literature, we find little evi-
dence that partnership characteristics influence the mean level of
condom use at most recent sex, although this could be the result of
complex within-partnership dynamics not well captured in our
data.
This study has several limitations. First, the data concerning
sexual activity, partnership characteristics, and condom use are
provided by self-report and could include measurement error re-
sulting from social desirability effects or concern about confiden-
tiality from interviewer, parents, or peers. Second, our data on
condom use are collected retrospectively and could contain recall
error. Third, the subsample for which we have data on partnerships
is a selective sample that differs in several respects from the main
study sample. Finally, our model could be misspecified. Data
limitations prevent us from precisely linking the timing of attitudes
and behaviors to the first or most recent sexual encounter; more
significantly, other unmeasured confounders could be associated
with condom use generally, which could further reduce the mag-
nitude of the direct effect. For example, we do not have data on
condom availability, which could influence use patterns, and our
information on family influence on condom use is limited to
maternal approval of birth control as reported by the adolescent for
which we found little influence on condom use in our study
population despite previous reports in the literature to the
opposite.20
However, our study has several advantages over previous stud-
ies of condom use among adolescents.19­22 We use a large and
nationally representative sample of adolescents; the data were
collected by A-CASI, which some studies have shown to elicit
more data about sensitive topics (eg, sexual behaviors) when

compared with data elicited through face-to-face interviews or
self-administered questionnaires45­47; and we use precise measure-
ment of condom use during particular sexual encounters rather
than vague measures of use (eg, in the past 3 months, past 6
months, or more than 50% lifetime condom use).20­22 Most sig-
nificantly, we directly test the association of condom use at sexual
debut with condom use at most recent sex by controlling for a
multitude of potentially influential factors, allowing more accurate
estimation of the magnitude of this effect.
This study contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of
condom use among adolescents and has several important impli-
cations for public health. Our robust finding that using a condom
at sexual debut doubles the odds of condom use at most recent sex,
controlling for other factors, highlights the importance of early and
comprehensive sexual education before the onset of sexual debut
to develop safe sexual habits among all adolescents. There could
indeed be a narrow window of opportunity, before sexual debut,
during which it is crucial to provide adolescents with the knowl-
edge and motivation to protect themselves and their partners.
Specifically, these programs should provide adolescents with skills
that will encourage them to use condoms from their very first
sexual experience, because this could increase the likelihood that
condom use becomes expected and routine for them over the
long-term. At the societal level, educating adolescents before they
become sexually active could have long-term benefits for prevent-
ing the significant morbidity and mortality associated with un-
planned teen pregnancy and STD/HIV infection, reducing the
associated social burden and economic costs.
New interventions should then be directed toward adolescents
who are not yet sexually active and have not yet established their
own patterns of sexual behavior. Exposing sexually inactive ado-
lescents to abstinence-only messages could be particularly coun-
terproductive for the subsequent development of healthy sexual
practices. Because STDs and unplanned pregnancy are hyperen-
demic among U.S. teenagers, perhaps condom use promotion
campaigns can borrow strategies from efforts to promote general
hygiene in children (eg, daily teeth brushing) and injury prevention
(eg, automobile seatbelt and bicycle helmet use).
Further research is needed to explore the lasting influence of
condom use at sexual debut on subsequent use. We need improved
conceptualization and measurement of factors that predispose
some adolescents to use condoms to better assess possible selec-
tion effects. We also need to know more about the dynamics of
adolescent sexual partnerships and the pattern of condom use
within different relationship types. Most importantly, we need to
understand how to encourage adolescents who have not yet be-
come condom users to adopt this important practice. We recom-
mend a comprehensive cost-effective sexual education interven-
tion that is appealing to adolescents, nonthreatening to society, and
yet oriented toward developing skills that will ensure the devel-
opment of long-lasting healthy habits in our teenagers.
