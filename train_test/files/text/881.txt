Cross Pressures on Middle-Aged Adults:
A Broader View

A MID-LIFE generation wedged between obligations to
·**· young children and elderly parents would seem to be an
obvious consequence of improved survivorship at the older
ages. Despite the intuitive appeal of this argument, both the
nature and prevalence of competing generational claims in
mid-life remain open questions several decades after the
notion first surfaced (Uhlenberg, 1993). Elsewhere in this
issue, Rosenthal, Martin-Matthews, and Matthews (1996)
use Canadian survey data to contribute new estimates of how
many middle-aged adults balance potential filial duties with
competing social roles.
How common are three-generation families in which the
dependencies of the youngest and oldest kin vie for the
resources of the middle generation? At the most basic level
this is a question of population structure, a fundamental
concern of demographers. In the aggregate, the relative
support burden on middle-aged persons (defined as broadly
as 15-64 years of age or as narrowly as ages 45-49) is
crudely measured by various dependency ratios. Estimates
are regularly published for the total dependency ratio (the
sum of "youth" and "elderly" support ratios) and, even
recently, a "sandwich generation" ratio (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1996). Because such calculations do not represent
actual family linkages, these ratios represent per capita
burden under the assumption that all middle-aged persons in
a population contribute equal effort to support young and
old, even those without children or living parents.
More realistic estimates of the generational structure of
families can be derived from simulation models. Multi-state
life table models, for example, allow demographers to esti-
mate the number of person-years a cohort survives with both
old parents and children given a regime of nuptuality,
fertility, and mortality risks. Watkins, Menken, and Bon-
gaarts (1987) use such a macro-simulation model to show
that the demographic conditions which prevailed in 1980
tipped the generational "seesaw" in favor of living longer
with parents aged 65 and over than with children under age
18. On average, only five years were lived having both an
older parent and a minor child, only slightly more than the
overlap years under the 1900 schedule of rates. Micro-
simulation models, such as SOCSIM described by Himmel,
Wachter, and McDaniel (1981) and Wolf's KINSIM (1988,
1994), generate even more refined representations of family
trees in historical and projected time.
Until recently demographic methods were required to
estimate the simple prevalence of three-generation families
within the population. But with the advent of the 1986-87
National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), and
its 1992-94 follow-up, data identifying kin both within and
outside the respondent's household are available to describe
the generational structure of mid-life families. Because fam-
ily information is reported for spouses/partners if married,
these data more fully describe the cross-pressures potentially
buffeting mid-life families.
Figure 1 displays the distribution of family structures by
age for a mid-life reference population using data from
NSFH 2. At ages 50-54, for example, about 5 percent have
parents or in-laws but no children and about one in five have
children but no parents or parents-in-law. By far, the most
common family structure at ages 50--54 is the family con-
taining at least three generations. Nearly 74 percent in this
age group have one or more living parents (or in-laws) and
one or more children (or stepchildren). The prevalence of
four-generation families (parents, children, grandchildren,
and the mid-life reference generation) is shown with a dotted
line to indicate that this type of family is a special case of
families with three or more generations. The prevalence of
the four-generation family crests at ages 50-54, about 10
years after the peak in the prevalence of families with at least
three generations.
Unlike the Canadian data of Rosenthal, Martin-Matthews,
and Matthews (1996), the estimates shown in Figure 1 sum-
marize potential obligations to parents and in-laws and chil-
dren and grandchildren. Several important features of con-
temporary family structure are obvious in these data. First,
membership in a three-generation family containing older
parents and children is modal for middle-aged adults up to age
60. Four-generation families also are fairly common for those
in their forties and fifties. Second, with a mean age of child-
bearing hovering around 26 years since 1960, very little of
the generational overlap occurs at a point when both the
elderly parents and offspring of middle-aged adults are likely
to need care. Rather, the timing of parent care is more likely
to coincide with the launching of young adult children.

adults aged 30 to 79. Family structure includes own biological parents and,

data from the 1992-94 National Survey of Families and Households.
Third, at a point in the life cycle of middle-aged adult
children when elderly parents or in-laws are at greatest risk
for frailty (typically after age 75), the generation in the
middle is more likely to be juggling care commitments to
grandchildren than to their own very young children.
Structural data alone neither prove nor dispel the image of
middle-aged adults caught in a web of generational obliga-
tions. Within the constraints of a given family structure,
actual helping behaviors must be examined. But because the
issue of mid-life family demands originally emerged in the
literature on parental caregiving, often only actual hands-on
assistance is considered in analyses of competing obligations
to kin at various ages. While future research needs to
integrate care involvement with grandchildren and in-laws,
far more important may be models which account for all
possible intergenerational exchanges. Locating kin obliga-
tions in such a matrix has important analytic advantages. The
currencies of intergenerational exchanges include not only
time (or services), but also money and space (co-residence).
Contingent on service availability, financial transfers can
substitute for labor-intensive care either for young children
or for frail parents. Financial assistance can take many
forms, including irregular but substantial transfers to help
with medical bills, the down payment on a first home,
college tuition, or living expenses during spells of unem-
ployment or times of marital transition (after widowhood of
a parent or divorce of a child). On occasion, payments may
by-pass the older parent or offspring and go directly to the
provider of services.
Rosenthal, Martin-Matthews, and Matthews (1996) and
other researchers report a very low incidence of financial
transfers to older parents. Indeed, elderly parents appear far
more likely to give financial help to children and grandchil-
dren than to receive it (Soldo and Hill, 1993). But the low
prevalence of financial help for parents and reverse flows
may mask competing family pressures on both the short- and
long-term resources of middle-aged adults in extended fami-
lies. Financial responsibility for college tuition may encour-
age work or sustain the commitment to work longer than
would otherwise be the case. Alternatively, providing labor-
intensive care for dependent parents or grandchildren may
discourage work, especially for women. Under either sce-
nario, intergenerational transfers have distinct implications
for pension eligibility, saving, asset accumulation, and ulti-
mately post-retirement incomes (Soldo and Hill, 1995).
These broader aspects of competing generational claims on
the resources of the middle-aged are often overlooked in
models which fail to recognize that care obligations --
whether to children, grandchildren, or parents -- are endog-
enous with labor supply decisions (i.e., care and work
decisions are jointly determined).
Locating parent care obligations in a broader array of
intergenerational exchanges also calls attention to potential
helper substitutions within the extended family. Most
middle-aged children with elderly parents have one or more
siblings with whom to share filial responsibilities (Wolf,
1994). Parents and most, if not all, children are likely to be
involved in deciding how to assemble a care network.
Analyzing the transfer behaviors and constraints of only one
mid-life child in a family underestimates the flow of re-
sources to an older parent and the sheer volume of competing
demands on adult children. Neither can such analyses pro-
vide insights into the division of labor within a family or the
distribution of burden across mid-life adults linked by blood
or marriage.
Extensive data are required to fully account for competing
claims on the financial and time resources of middle-aged
adults and the correlation of their transfer behaviors with
work. The new Health and Retirement Study (HRS), de-
scribed by Juster and Suzman (1995), provides many of the
needed data elements for a large representative sample of
persons aged 51-61 in 1992. At a point when four-genera-
tional obligations peak, detailed family roster data are avail-
able on children, parents, and siblings for both spouses/
partners in the case of couples. More importantly, each
mention of an intergenerational transfer is linked to the spe-
cific relative who receives or provides the transfer. It is
possible, for example, to describe a parent care system in
terms of the hours and dollars contributed by each child, in the
context of each one's own competing family constraints and
work behaviors (Soldo and Hill, 1995). Because family ros-
ters and transfers are updated at each biennial interview, dy-
namic models of generational competition also are possible.
The image of middle-aged adults balancing parent care
duties with child care duties is clearly an inappropriate
rendering of mid-life. A fuller account of cross pressures at
mid-life requires data and analyses which recognize alterna-
tive transfer currencies, siblings as potential substitute help-
ers, and obligations to both own kin and kin by marriage.
Because there is a natural life-cycle rhythm to giving and
receiving transfers, panel data are needed to evaluate how
reciprocities (either bequests from parents or assistance later
in life from own children) offset the sheer volume of claims
on mid-life resources.
