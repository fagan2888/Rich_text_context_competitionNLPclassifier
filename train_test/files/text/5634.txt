As an economy transforms from an agricultural economy to an industrial
economy, a decline in participation of female labour force is observed.
This is attributed to the shift from family-based production to large-scale
production in industrial units. The womenfolk being mostly illiterate or with low
levels of education face shortage of work in the home turf and have inhibitions
in working as manual labour in the non-agricultural sector. But with an increase
in family income and improvement in the education level of females, more and
more females start entering the labour force, especially into non-manual or service-
oriented jobs. That is why the participation of females in the labour force in
comparison with the economic growth is supposed to be U-shaped (Goldin, 1994).
This article examines how the experience has been in India especially among rural
females who account for the major share of the rural population.
For developing countries, average patterns of women's labour force participation
are more mixed, ranging from as low as 21 per cent in the Middle East and North
African region to as high as 71 per cent in the East Asian and Pacific region in 2010.
The gender gaps in labour force participation are also highest in the Middle East
and North African and South Asian regions, where men's participation rates exceed
women's rates by over 50 percentage points.1 The labour force participation rate
(LFPR) in India is around 40 per cent, but gender-wise, for females it is only 22.5
per cent.2 The gap in male­female labour force participation is such that the LFPR
for rural females of the age group over 15 years is only 35.8 per cent, while for rural
males it is more than double at 81.3 per cent.3 This is quite baffling in a country with
a huge demographic dividend of the working population. Studies undertaken to
analyse this trend of low and declining female LFPR (FLFPR) has attributed it to
education and income effect (Rangarajan, Kaul, & Seema, 2011; Vinoj, 2013). In a
culturally diverse country like India, socio-cultural aspects also have a say in the
economic participation of the women. India's policies on liberalization, privatiza-
tion and globalization initiated in the early nineties and more than two decades
of reform-induced economic growth have driven the economy to a double-digit
growth. This article examines how the participation of the female labour force has

fared, during this period of positive growth, espe-
cially in rural areas, wherein almost 70 per cent of the
female population lives (Census 2011).4 The trend anal-
ysis in the paper covers five quinquennial National
Sample Survey (NSS) Rounds on the Employment and
Unemployment Survey (EUS) (1993­1994, 1999­2000,
2004­2005, 2009­2010 and 2011­2012).
RURAL FEMALE LABOUR FORCE
PARTICIPATION IN INDIA
The pursuit of neoliberal economic policies5 has led to a
discussion of both defeminization and feminization of
labour force in the economic literature. But, according
to the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO)
EUS, the rural female LFPR (RFLFPR) has been almost
half of the rural male LFPR, while in the urban areas, the
FLFPR is even less than half of the male LFPR (Table 1).
While the FLFPR marginally revived in urban areas
in 2011­2012, in the rural areas, the declining trend
continues except for the year 2004­2005.

With nearly 80 per cent (NSSO 2011­2012, 68th round)
of the female labour force being concentrated in rural
areas, the focus of this paper is on addressing the
issue from the rural angle. Table 2 captures the age
cohort-wise distribution of rural female labour force
across the Rounds. It emerges that there has been a
steady decline in the LFPR from 1993­1994 to 2011­
2012 in the age group of 5­9 years and 10­14 years
indicating that the rural females of this age group are
in the education space. Similarly, in the 15­19 and
20­24 age-cohort, a decline in the LFPR is seen in
2009­2010 and 2011­2012.

The LFPR reaches its prime in the age group of 30­49
years, but even among this group, except for 2004­2005,
when there was a rise in labour force participation, the
FLFPR is seen declining. To understand why women
who were earlier in the labour force were leaving, the
activity status of rural females outside the labour force
was looked into (Table 3).

consumption increased from 56 per cent in 1993­1994 to
60 per cent in 2011­2012, while for urban females, it has
been around 64 per cent during this period. The women
who spent their time in domestic duties belonged to all
age groups. The proportion of rural females aged 15­29
years who spent their time in domestic duties increased
from 54.8 per cent in 2004­2005 to 57.5 per cent in 2011­
2012, while the proportion for the 30­44 year age group
increased from 52.5 to 65.8 per cent during this period.6
In other words, in the economically active age group
(15­64 years), 151.9 million and 81.8 million females
were outside the labour force in the rural and urban
areas, respectively, in 2011­2012.7 It appears that rural
women who move out of the labour force get into full-
time domestic duties and/or do activities for their own
consumption. Table 4 highlights the probable reasons
for moving out of the labour force. It is evident that
most of the women spend more than 80 per cent of
their time in domestic duties as purportedly there is no
other person to carry out these duties. The proportion
of rural women engaged in domestic duties and prefer-
ring to stay in the household has declined from 70 per
cent in 1993­1994 to 66 per cent in 2011­2012. In other
terms, the proportion of females who expressed their
willingness to work has increased from 30 per cent to 34
per cent, and the majority of them wanted to work on a
regular part-time basis so as to attend to their domestic
duties also. This implies that there has been a change
in the sentiment among rural women to be engaged in
economically productive activities.
As may be seen from Table 5, the rural females have
given preference for women-centric work which
can be discharged from the household or within
the periphery of the household in the nature of self-
employed. Although a majority of rural females have
asked for venture capital, a decline in trend for this
assistance and an increase in demand for training
may be noticed across the rounds. The preference for
women-centric jobs also implies that rural females
prefer activities which can easily blend with their
domestic duties. To further understand the work
preferences, the workforce distribution of rural
females was looked into.

258 DECLINE IN RURAL FEMALE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION IN INDIA: A RELOOK INTO THE CAUSES
Rural Female Workforce Distribution
More than 70 per cent of the rural female workforce
(Table 6) is engaged in agriculture, and the proportion
of workforce engaged in agriculture in principal
and subsidiary capacity is around 75 per cent across
different NSSO rounds. In 2004­2005, when there was
a spurt in RFLFPR, the proportion of rural females
engaged in agriculture in principal or subsidiary
capacity was found to be lower than that in 1999­
2000. But the proportion of females engaged in the
non-farm sector saw a rise in 2004­2005. The declining
trend in the share of employment in agriculture both
in principal and subsidiary capacity is evident from
2009­2010 onwards.
Rural females engaged in manufacturing as a prin-
cipal activity declined from 12.7 per cent in 1993­1994
to 9.4 per cent in 2011­2012, while the proportion of
rural females engaged in manufacturing as a subsid-
iary activity decreased from 32 per cent in 1993­1994
to 7.1 per cent in 2009­2010 and marginally increased
to 10.2 per cent in 2011­2012. This implies that there
was the loss of jobs for women who were engaged
in manufacturing. This may be due to the decrease
in demand for the products from traditional indus-
tries which led to the loss of jobs for women. In the
non-manufacturing sector that consists of the construc-
tion sector apart from public utilities, there has been a
decline in the share of rural females since 1993­1994,
which sees a reversal from 2009­2010 onwards. In the
services sector, the share of rural females in the prin-
cipal status has steadily increased from 1993­1994 to
2011­2012, while as a subsidiary activity, there has
been a fluctuation in their participation. Thus, in the
past two decades, while the services sector has shown
a rise in jobs for the rural females, agriculture shows
a declining trend and in the industry sector a reversal
is noticed only in the last two rounds. But only if the
decline in agriculture jobs is commensurate with the
increase in jobs in the non-farm sector, can the situa-
tion of loss of jobs be arrested.
Distribution of Rural Female Workforce by
Employment Status
Agriculture is the main sector that employs the rural
female workforce. The employment status of the work-
force engaged in agriculture over the rounds may be
seen in Table 7.
In the agriculture sector, among rural females who
reported themselves as self-employed, there was an
increase in the proportion of the own account worker
category both in the principal status and subsidiary
status. But what is disturbing is that a large proportion
of rural females in agriculture are working as unpaid
helpers both in principal and subsidiary capacity. The
sudden spurt in the labour force and workforce in
2004­2005 also witnessed an increase in the propor-
tion of rural females engaged in agriculture working
as helpers and a decline in those working as casual
labour. This may be attributed to distress employ-
ment as agriculture and allied activities grew at a rate
of 0.89 per cent during the period from 2002­2003
to 2004­2005 (Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007­2012,
Vol. III).

Note. Self-employed has been split into three sub-categories, namely own account worker, employer and helper who are
mainly family members and unpaid. The category, casual labour in public works, was removed as it was insignificant.
The distribution of the workforce by employment
and activity status in the manufacturing sector may
be seen in Table 8. The rural female working as an
employer under the self-employed category was
almost non-existent in all the rounds. However, those
working as the own account worker in the principal and
subsidiary capacity saw an increase. Those reported
working as unpaid, though considerable, shows a
declining trend. This raises the doubt as to whether
family members who were earlier working as helpers
started reporting as own account workers. While rural
females working in the regular wage/salaried category
in principal capacity saw an increase, those working in
subsidiary capacity were almost insignificant.
Rural females working as casual labour in principal
capacity show a decline, while in the subsidiary
capacity there are wide fluctuations. Thus, out
of the small proportion of workforce engaged in
manufacturing, the increase in the share of the
regular employed is a positive sign of decent jobs
being created.
In the non-manufacturing sector, a majority of the rural
females are found working as casual labour in other
types of work (Table 9).
But in the last two rounds, there is a decline in rural
females working in principal capacity as casual labour
in other types of work and an increase in the proportion
of females working in subsidiary capacity as a casual
worker in public works. Can this be interpreted as a
shift by the rural females with the loss of jobs in manu-
facturing and agriculture to the non-manufacturing
sector especially construction and working in subsid-
iary capacity?

In the services sector, a good trend of rural females
engaged as regular wage/salaried class in principal
capacity is seen steadily increasing (Table 10).At the same
time a decline in rural females engaged as own account
workers, helpers and casual labour can also be observed.
The ILO Research Paper No. 10 (Kapsos, Silberman,
& Bourmpoula, 2014) attributes the decline in female
labour force participation to the rising number of
females in the age group of 15­24 attending educational
institutions, an increase in household income levels,
and the measurement issue in capturing female work
in NSSO surveys. The next section explores the effect of
these factors on female labour force participation.
Education Effect
With the introduction of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan8
and the Right to Education Act, 2009, there has been an
improvement in the basic education level up to 14 years
of age. But for better employability, the enhancement of
skills after 14 years is a prerequisite. A look at the mean
years of education after 14 years shows an increasing
trend since 1993­1994, though still low at around two
years for rural females and three-plus years for urban
females in the last two NSSO rounds (Table 11).

Among the rural females in the 15­24 age group, who
reported their current status under Code 91,9 that is,
attending educational institutions, reveal that only 8 per
cent of the females in this age-cohort were in Code 91 in
1993­1994, 15 per cent in 2004­2005 and 2009­2010, and
20 per cent in 2011­2012. In other words, in 2011­2012, 80
per cent of the women in the 15­24 age bracket were not
attending educational institutions and their LFPR was
23 per cent implying that 57 per cent of the women were
engaged in domestic duties. Furthermore, the mean age
of marriage in rural India being 20.8 years (Statistical
Report, 2012), for the majority of rural females in the
prime age, entry into the labour force may perhaps be
hindered by social factors such as marriage and domestic
duties. Hence, the argument that fall in the rural LFPR of
the females in the 15­24 bracket is due to an increase in
their attending education institutions (education effect)
is not fully substantiated by available data. However,
with schemes like the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha
Abhiyan (RMSA) focusing on improving accessibility,
quality and outreach of secondary education with special
focus on more female teachers in schools, separate toilet
blocks for girls, incentives to girls students, and hostel
facilities, etc., an increase in the mean years of education
of rural females would be evident in the years to come.
Another factor that can facilitate entry of female youth
is the declining fertility rate. The total fertility rate (TFR)
in rural India has declined from 3.7 in 1993­1994 to 2.6
in 2011­2012.10 But even with the decline in the TFR,
the rural females are seen withdrawing from the labour
force and engaging in domestic duties. Therefore, the
natural question that arises is: Could the withdrawal
from labour force be due to the absence of distress
employment (income effect)? (Rangarajan et al., 2011).
Income Effect
To assess the impact of income effect on withdrawal
of females from the labour force, the household
MPCE (monthly per capita employment) data from
the EUS for the period from 2004­2005 to 2011­2012
was examined. The household level MPCE data
was used to form decile classes. These decile classes
divided the households into 10 classes such that the
lowest class represented the lowest 10 per cent in the
spectrum of income distribution and the top or the
highest decile class represented the top 10 per cent of
the households in terms of their expenditure. Using
MPCE for the study of the income distribution may
not be a good proxy for income in higher classes as
then the savings and expenditure on certain other
luxurious activities/items like tourism and jewellery,
to name a few, are not accounted for. However, in the
lower classes of income where the expenditure on
food, housing, clothing, education and medicine form
a high percentage of the total MPCE, the approxima-
tion works quite well.

It is observed from Figure 1 that there has been a decline
in the rural FLFPR among all the MPCE decile classes11
in 2011­2012 as compared to 2004­2005. The decline in
FLFPR is 9.2 per cent on average in the first three decile
classes, 8.8 per cent in the middle three decile classes
and 6.6 per cent in the upper four decile classes.
The magnitude of improvement in the average per
capita consumption expenditure in rural areas varies
between 9 per cent and 15 per cent up to the 6th decile
class, whereas for the rest 4 deciles, it varies between
15 per cent and 23 per cent (Table 12). The decline in
female labour force participation in the lower decile
classes may be attributed to income effect because the
females might have withdrawn from distress employ-
ment, but the same argument does not support the
withdrawal of females belonging to the middle and
higher decile classes (Figure 1).
The decile class-wise distribution of workforce into
different employment status reveals that as compared
to 2004­2005, in 2011­2012, there has been an increase in

in the lower and middle decile classes, while a decline

working as an unpaid helper. The data also suggests an
increase in regular salaried/wage employed across all
decile classes and a significant increase in casual workers
in public works. The proportion of females in casual
works other than public works declined significantly,
especially in lower decile classes, whereas it increased
in higher decile classes (Table 13).

This clearly indicates a shift to casual work in the
public works category which can be attributed to
the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). But the average person-
days generated per household under MGNREGA has
been hovering between 45 and 50, which suggests that,
although preferred, the work opportunity generated by
MGNREGA is not sufficient. Also, another key impor-
tant implication is the fall in the unpaid helper cate-
gory. The movement or shift in the employment status
across decile classes clearly indicates that women have
preference for a decent kind of work. Also, as alter-
natives to remunerative employment are provided
by programmes like MGNREGA, they do not prefer
working as unpaid workers. This motivation towards
remunerative employment is well supported if we take
a look at trends in wage rates.
Although MPCE is a proxy for per household income,
wage data as available in NSSO covers only two sets of
employment, namely, casual and regular job, leaving
out the self-employed where nearly 50 per cent of the
female workforce is engaged. However, an attempt
to analyse the wage data of workers in regular and
casual employment (Table 14) shows that in terms of
2004­2005 prices, the regular female workers have
witnessed more increase in their wages/salaries. In
rural areas, the female wages/salaries for regular
type of work increased by 30 per cent in 2011­2012
over 2004­2005 as compared to only 23 per cent
for males.

In the case of casual workers involved in works other
than public works, the wages for female workers
appreciated by 63 per cent as against 50 per cent
for the male counterparts in 2011­2012. For those
involved in public works other than MNREGA,
women workers experienced better hike in their
compensation/wages.
These results are in contradiction with the argument
that it was the increase in income of the head of the
household which caused women especially in rural
areas to withdraw from labour force. The labour
market outcomes in monetary terms were much better
for females than for males. Drawing from the labour
supply theory in economics, since the wage outcomes
are higher for females, this must increase the opportu-
nity cost of the leisure or the tendency to stay out of
labour force by the choice per se. This should, in turn,
be a motivating factor for them to come out and work.
But it is also important to take cognizance of the sectoral
wage changes.
It can be observed from Table 15 that rural females
experienced a rise in wages in mining, manufacturing,
construction, trade, hotels and restaurant, and
transport. The services sector experienced a less
proportionate increase in wages of females as
compared to that of males. The manufacturing sector
which employed 10 per cent of the female workforce
in rural areas in 2011 and registered an increase of 1.44
per cent in jobs between 2004­2005 and 2011­2012
saw a sharp increase in wages of female workers as
compared to their male counterparts. Construction is
another sector where there is a significant rise in wages
for women with a 5.14 per cent increase in jobs created
for females. There is a steep fall in the proportion of jobs
in agriculture and allied activities for females between
these two NSSO rounds. Although manufacturing,

264 DECLINE IN RURAL FEMALE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION IN INDIA: A RELOOK INTO THE CAUSES
construction, trade, hotels and restaurants can be
economically fruitful sectors for female workforce, the
share of female workforce in regular employment in
these sectors was only 5.6 per cent as compared to 10
per cent for males in 2011­2012. Thus, the women who
lost jobs in agriculture did not find place in other sectors
of the economy. Looking at the educational profile of
the rural female labour force (Figure 2), clearly, it is
the low educational attainment of rural females that
acts as a barrier to their smooth inter-sectoral labour
mobility. Nearly 69 per cent of the rural females are
either illiterate or have educational attainment only up
to the primary level.

Thus, more than the income effect, it is the lack of
sufficient opportunities commensurate with the skill
levels of the women in rural areas that has caused the
withdrawal of females from the labour market.
Gender Gap
Table 16 shows the male­female gap in the LFPR across
Indian states during the period from 1993­1994 to
2011­2012 highlighting their minimum, maximum and
median rates.
Table 16: LFPR (in %) (1993­1994 to 2011­2012)

Rural Male 53 55 56
Rural Female 24 30 33
Source: Authors' calculations from NSSO rounds: 1993­
1994 and 2011­2012.
It is evident that the gender gap between male and
female labour force participation is 25 percentage
points in rural India (median value of 55­30). Across
rural India, it can be seen that during the period from
2004­2005 to 2011­2012, except Himachal Pradesh, all
other major states experienced an increase in the gender
gap between male and female labour force participa-
tion (Table 17). It ranges from 2 percentage points in
Himachal Pradesh to 43 percentage points in Bihar.
The maximum increase in the gender gap between
2004­2005 and 2011­2012 was observed in the states of
Karnataka, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab,
Jharkhand and Odisha. If the states are arranged in
ascending order of the gender gap in the LFPR in rural
India, all the states which show a sharp increase in the
gender gap in 2011­2012 figured in the middle range
in 2004­2005 with the gender gap widening between
11 (Odisha) and 16 (Karnataka) percentage points in
2011­2012.

So, the question is what happened to these states in
the middle range of the gender gap spectrum that
forced women to withdraw from the labour force? To
answer this, Table 18 analyses the state-wise change in
sectoral workforce composition in rural India between
2004­2005 and 2011­2012.
It is observed that agriculture, which was the primary
work area of women, has seen a decline across these
states. However, the women workers who have been
displaced from agriculture did not find place in
non-farm sectors. The jobs created were mostly in the
construction and utilities sector where women have a
very small share in employment. Even in the service
sector, jobs created were in transportation, storage,
communications, trade, hotels and restaurants which
also did not benefit those who had to leave agricul-
ture. With rural females mostly employed as the own
account worker, unpaid helper or casual worker, the
switch over to unskilled work in other sectors was
limited considering their educational profile. Hence,
the women in rural areas can be said to have experi-
enced more of a discouraged worker effect that further
pushed them out of the labour market.
Measuring the Female Labour Force Participation
It has been pointed out that there are measurement
issues with the NSSO surveys which have been the
reason for a significant underestimation of the female
work (Kapsos et al., 2014).Alarge number of literature is
available on data underestimation. Women are involved
in subsistence and extended SNA activities12 which are
often uncounted or undercounted. The flexible time
arrangements and indulgence in unpaid family work
may result in reporting or probing errors. The NSSO
schedule does capture subsidiary activities and also tries
to collect details on extended SNA activities. The use of
time use surveys (TUS) has been advocated in various
studies, but carrying it out is difficult and cumbersome
taking into consideration the sample size of regular
employment­unemployment survey (Hirway, 2000).
Also, getting the responses from the people of the
activities with small time slots is difficult.
TO SUM UP
Among all the arguments, income effect, education effect
and the problem of underestimation, what is left unno-
ticed is the structural transformation of the economy and
its resultant impact on the female labour market in the
whole process. With an increase in income levels of the
households, a woman no longer prefers working as an
unpaid worker or a helper or as a casual worker unless
the work is remunerative (as in MGNREGA). However,
such opportunities are limited in rural India and as a
result women are not finding jobs matching their pref-
erence (regular part-time jobs close to their households).
Furthermore, with low skill levels, jobs in the non-farm
sector are also limited. These factors perhaps have led to
the withdrawal of women from the labour force.
POLICY STRATEGIES
The decline observed in rural female labour force
participation is due to a complex mix of several forces
working simultaneously. While the focus is on educa-
tion and income effect, our findings reveal that the lack
of sufficient non-farm jobs in rural areas has forced
women to stay out of the labour market. The wage
conditions prevalent in the rural labour market show

266 DECLINE IN RURAL FEMALE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION IN INDIA: A RELOOK INTO THE CAUSES
that female workers have experienced a better hike in
wages/salaries; it implies that the gender gap in terms
of wages/salaries has started declining. But the oppor-
tunities available in rural India which are compatible
with their education levels are dying out. Dedicated
efforts in skilling, re-skilling and improving their
educational outcomes through infrastructure develop-
ment, female teacher availability, incentives along with
creating an adequate number of favourable job oppor-
tunities are necessary to harness their potential.
Considering the constraints experienced by the rural
females to enter the labour force (Tables 4 and 5),
policy initiatives are required to make them econom-
ically active. The initiatives should focus on microfi-
nance-supported self-help group-centred activities,
which will make them economically active along
with handling domestic duties. Also, this will help
to address the need for working finance assistance as
expressed by the females willing to accept work. If
such policy initiatives materialize and the 34 per cent
women in activity codes 92 and 93, who are willing to
work, enter the labour force, the rural female participa-
tion rate would increase from the current 25.3 per cent
to 39 per cent.
Furthermore, rural manufacturing should create jobs
that can be undertaken by women in their household
or as a community. Such focused steps can increase the
participation of rural females back into the labour force.
For females in the 15­24 age group who are about
to enter the labour force, vocational and basic skills
training need to be provided so that they can enter
the labour market overcoming social inhibitions and
restrictions. Lack of adequate infrastructure in terms
of roads and connectivity can also be deterring women
from undertaking work in the nearby areas. Thus,
improving connectivity between the villages and the
satellite towns and small cities will also enhance female
labour force participation.
India has already started realizing its demographic divi-
dend and female population which account for nearly
50 per cent of the population is an asset to be utilized
carefully if we have to reap this window of opportu-
nity. Declining fertility rate and child dependency ratio
are factors which can facilitate female workers to come
out. In short, a bubbling rural economy is the need of
the hour to create jobs and absorb the bulging econom-
ically active female population.
