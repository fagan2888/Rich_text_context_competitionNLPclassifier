Introduction
Banking and Financial Institutions (BFIs) show the growth of
development of a country. Banking sector in India has made
strides in using digital technology. Due to fast development in
the Internet technology in higher income group economies,
under developed and developing countries will be automati-
cally marginalized thereby creating digital divide. And, it will
affect automatically more to a person with disability.
The size of the financially excluded population in the world
is enormous: Around 3 billion people in the world have less
access and opportunity for formal financial services. Websites
arethefaceofinstitutions,whichhaveaglobalreach.According
to Gerry McGovern (2006), "website reflects true face of an
organization as never before" (December 5, 2013). Website
creates a direct link between the organization and the customer.
BFIs in India offer people help in investments, loans to increase
their business, income, and worth. Persons with Disabilities
(PWDs) are also consumers of products and programs of finan-
cial institutions. Many PWDs access banks through websites.
They are used by BFIs in India, as an Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) medium. They use their
websites for financial transactions, services, and dissemination
of information. According to Gerry McGovern (2006), "a
website is increasingly the place where customers get that vital
first impression" (December 5, 2013). Accessibility of these
websites to PWDs will be the test of their global reach. All the
BFIs in India offer people help in investments, loans to increase
their business, income, and worth guided and monitored by
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations.
The History of Indian Banking and
Finance Institutions
The Indian Central government had a strong control over the
banking system in India. State Bank of India was the first
nationalized bank which was former Imperial Bank of India.

Digital Inclusion for Access to
Information: A Study on Banking and
Financial Institutions in India
P. J. Mathew Martin1,2,3 and Manukonda Rabindranath4
Abstract
Banking and Financial Institutions (BFIs) show the growth of development of a country. Digital literacy and its development in a
country depend on its use by the citizens of a country. In India, they have recently made strides in using digital technology due to
fast development in the Internet technology. The recent "World Report on Disability" by World Health Organization (WHO) puts
the disabled populations in the world at 15%. There are 26.81 million Indians who suffer from some form of disability. This research
study critically probes the two determinants of the digital divide: (a) the accessibility of websites of banks and (b) the accessibility
of financial and banking information on their websites. United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
(UNCRPD) guidelines has been ratified by Government of India in 2007. The websites of 103 BFIs in India were used for the study.
The research study work started on December 3, 2013; it being the World Day of the Disabled. The study aimed for evaluating the
websites in terms of media tool for communication, information, services, accessibility, design, and interactive participatory features
for persons with disabilities. The study showed that 26% of the websites under study and 5% International BFIs in India offered
information in vernacular medium, while only seven websites of the BFIs in India passed markup validation test.

In the beginning days after Independence banking system
was operated by the private banking system.
The Indian government thought that they should have a
strong influence over the strong banking sector. As a result,
there is a decline in productivity and a rise in nonperforming
assets. After that the government thought of appointing
ombudsmen to look into the problem of the organizations.
The RBI and Regulations
RBI Act, 1934, gave the provision to establish RBI on April
1, 1935, to take precautionary measures and keep a tab on the
banking and finance sectors. It is an autonomous body to
take decisions and for day-to-day governance. RBI will print
new currency notes of different denominations depending
about the requirements and keep some reserve finances of
the banking sectors as security deposits for the customers in
case of some eventualities or huge loss for a particular bank.
"Digital inclusion tends to be solely associated with tech-
nical accessibility issues" (Steyaert, 2005, pp. 67-68).
The Internet facilitates the creation of websites.According
to Karandikar (2011), "in India the internet is arguably the
most convergent medium of communication today" (pp.
32-37). Websites are a convergent medium enabling the
financial institutions in India to interact and communicate
with the prospective consumers and the public. Hence, acces-
sible websites have great significance in reaching out finan-
cial programs, products, and information about financial
institutions of higher standing in economics.
The National Policy on Universal Electronic
Accessibility
The objective of the policy is to provide PWDs equal access to
electronic and information and communication technology and
services.This policy expands on the United Nations Convention
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) which
India has ratified. The Union Cabinet on October 3, 2013
approved the national policy on universal electronic accessibil-
ity that recognizes the need to eliminate discrimination on the
basis of disabilities as well as to facilitate equal access to elec-
tronics and ICTs. The policy will facilitate equal and unhindered
access to electronics and ICT products and services by differ-
ently abled persons (both physically and mentally challenged)
and to facilitate local language support for the same. This shall
be achieved through universal access to electronics and ICT
products and services to synchronize with barrier-free environ-
ment and preferably usable without adaptation. Differently
abled persons all over the country will benefit from this policy
(Press Information Bureau, Government of India, 2013).
The following strategies are envisaged for the implemen-
tation of the policy:
1. Creating awareness on design and accessibility of
universal electronics.
2. Capacity building and infrastructure development.
3. Setting up of model electronics and ICT centers for
providing training and demonstration to special edu-
cators of/and physically as well as mentally chal-
lenged persons.
4. Conducting research and development, use of inno-
vation, ideas, technology, and so on, whether indige-
nous or outsourced from abroad.
5. Developing programs and schemes with greater
emphasis for differently abled persons.
6. Developing procurement guidelines for electronics
and ICTs for accessibility and assistive needs.
The Growth of ICT in India
There is an exponential growth in Information Technology (IT)
in India. Personal computer (PC) penetration in India is 18 per
1,000aspertheannualreportoftheManufacturer'sAssociation
of Information Technology (MAIT), published in July 2006.
India had, as on September 2008, 45.3 million active
Internet users. This is according to the I-Cube (Internet in
India) study released and conducted annually by Indian
Market Research Bureau (IMRB) International and Internet
and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).
This emphasizes the need for such cost-effective technol-
ogy with global reach. Thus, it validates the use of websites
to bridge the gap and reaching out to PWDs.
Uses and Gratification Theory (UGT)
The current study draws its theoretical base from the UGT of
Elihu Katz (1959), which encourages audience-centered
approach in mass communication (pp. 1-6). This theory
helps us to understand why and how persons using ICT gain
in terms of information and education. As a positivistic the-
ory of communication, unlike other media effect theories,
UGT is based on sociopsychological need of the audience.
PWDs being part of the society uses ICT to satiate their
needs, which includes financial and banking needs.
PWDs
In this research study, PWDs are those, as per the PWD
(Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full
Participation) Act, 1995, who are affected with blindness,
low vision, leprosy-cured, hearing impairment, loco motor
disability, mental retardation, and mental illness. According
to this act, in India, "PWD" means a person suffering from
not less than 40% of any disability as certified by a medical
authority (Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs
[Legislative Department], 1996).
Accessibility Rights of PWDs
In India, there are 26.81 million Indians who suffer from
some form of disability. The estimated population with bank-
ing or financial transaction needs in India, among the
Mathew Martin and Rabindranath 3
disabled, is 18,809,846 persons (i.e., 87% of the disabled
population in the age group of 19 and above). It is a large
number of the population who cannot be denied their rights
to banking and financial inclusion. Quite often, nonaccessi-
bility of the websites of these banking and BFIs in India
become one of the reasons for this financial inclusion by
BFIs (Table 1).
Article 9.2 (g) and (h) of UNCRPD especially lays down
that states should facilitate access for PWDs to new informa-
tion and communication technologies, especially the Internet.
In fact, their report on "making mobile phones and services
accessible to persons with disabilities" published by the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in coopera-
tion with global initiative for inclusive ICTs (ITU & G3ict,
n.d.), Nirmita Narasimhan and Axel Leblois (2012) state that
the Article 9 makes provisions for promoting assistive tech-
nologies and information in alternative formats (2013,
December 21). In addition, Article 9.2 (f) states that signato-
ries must promote forms of help and support to PWDs to
ensure their access to information (Narasimhan & Leblois,
2013, December 21). In Article 9.2 (g), the convention out-
lines the mandate to ensure access to "new information and
communications technologies and systems including the
Internet" (Narasimhan & Leblois, 2013, December 21).
The ITC Act, 2000, of India was entirely silent on the sub-
ject of web accessibility. Since then efforts were made by
various advocacy groups to increase accessibility of ICT. This
resulted in the union cabinet of India passing the national
policy on universal electronic accessibility. They are provided
in the "guidelines for Indian Government websites, an inte-
gral part of central secretariat manual of office procedure"
(Verma, Joshi, & Kalra, 2009, p. 4) prepared by National
Informatics Center (NIC) and adopted by Department of
Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG).
Common man and PWDs communicate through websites
of BFIs with minimum expenditure. BFIs in India cannot
ignore the large consumer base with the Internet penetration
increasing at the rate of about 16% every year.
Making Website for PWDs
If the parameters of a website's communication capabilities are
met by BFIs in India, like W3C compliance under markup lan-
guage, then we may consider a website as "good website for
disability communication." There are various parameters to
test a website's communication capabilities. For this research,
the parameters used to study the websites of BFIs in India are
accessibility, design, and interactive and participatory features.
Considering equal opportunities provided under the PWD Act,
1995, this research also looks into the equalization and normal-
ization theories with respect to the Internet.1
Objectives
The main objective of the short research study was to assess
and demonstrate the qualities of websites designed by BFIs
in India, in terms of information dissemination, accessibility,
design, and interactive and participatory features. The study
also aimed for measuring these features in all the websites
selected for the study, using online validation methods
already available on the Internet.
Research Questions
Does the BFI website have information dissemination
features?
1. Does the BFI website follow the guidelines of
UNCRPD with reference to accessibility, access to
information?
2. Are the BFIs websites designed to meet the require-
ments of students with disabilities, such as availabil-
ity of screen reader, font size increase, color change,
alternate texts, and Indian Sign Language?
3. Do the websites of BFIs in India conform to the
accessible design features such as "F" pattern (Does
the website have the shape of letter "F" in their design
and layout) for fast viewing of a website?
4. Are the websites of BFIs in India more interactive or
participatory in nature for PWDs?
Method
This study aimed at requirements and qualities of a website
designed by BFIs in India in terms of design, formal and
accessible features, necessary precautions were taken to
select the websites available on the list of BFIs as per RBI
report 2013 published by the Department of Economic and
Policy Research (DEPR), RBI in the year 2012-13, to assess
and measure accessibility features. The specific day
December 3, 2013, being "World Disability Day" was
selected for studying the accessibility features of these web-
sites, considering the maximum significance of the day in a
year for PWDs in India.
In total, 103 websites of various BFIs in India were care-
fully studied. These BFIs were RBI accredited as per the list
displayed in the website of RBI. Screenshots of the websites
were also used as part of the sample. In this study, the
researcher has tested 103 websites of BFIs in India for W3C
compliance and assessed them. The assessment was based on
the several parameters like interactivity, accessibility, and
information inputs.
Same was done using the inventory of the websites and
the structural analysis for tabulation of the data. As the

websites followed no single standard, there was a need to
standardize the website area. The screenshots of every home
page of the 103 websites of BFIs in India were captured and
printed.
Content analysis of the website in terms of accessibility
was done online, using the web-based validator tools for
accessibility. The Universal Resource Locator (URL) of the
website of the BFIs in India to be tested was typed in the
address slot and tested for its validation online. The results of
the test were considered as data for analysis. The online free
test tools provided by W3C were used for accessibility in this
study. This includes validator tools for "markup validation,"
"cascading style sheets validator," "mobile validator," "link
check validator," and "unicorn validator."
Sampling
The present research is a survey with purposive sampling.
The list of all BFIs was obtained from the annual report on
the profile of banks published by the DEPR, RBI in the year
2012-13. Hence, only websites of BFIs operating in India as
per the above report are selected as sample for the study.
Initially, each selected website was browsed in search of
various aspects of the website in terms of design, formal,
functional, and accessible features. Later, they were classi-
fied into three groups: (a) those features that belonged to pri-
vate sector banks (PSBs), (b) public sector banks, and (3)
foreign banks (FBs) so that each accessible feature of the
website collected would fall into these three groups, and a
comparative study was done.
Limitations
1. Only 103 websites of BFIs in India were studied.
This included 43 websites belonging to FBs, 40 web-
sites belonging to PSBs, and 20 belonging to PSBs.
2. The websites of financial institutions which are
undertakings of Government of India, including that
of RBI, have been included in the PSBs.
3. Websites selected for the study included those BFIs
which were obtained from annual report on the pro-
file of banks published by the DEPR, RBI in the year
2012-13.
4. The websites have been downloaded, assessed, and
analyzed only on December 3, 2013 (World Disabled
Day). No updates were studied.
5. The accessibility of electronic documents linked with
webpage is not included.
6. Websites in English language are selected for the
study.
Analysis and Discussion
To achieve the objectives of the research of BFIs operating in
India, data collected using the online research tools provided
were gathered and the same were analyzed using SPSS.
During the study, it was observed that all the websites of BFIs
in India could be opened using the URL provided in the list of
banks published by the DEPR, RBI in the year 2012-13.
However, the URL of one BFI, namely, "Shipping Credit
Investment Company of India" (SCIC) showed that it was a
dormant website and could not be further assessed. Some of
the websites had basic features of accessibility such as screen
reader, font size or color change, alternative text for the visuals
for the blind, and use of captions for the video or Sign
Language for the Deaf (capital "D" to indicate culturally deaf).
In Figure 1 and Table 2, it may be observed that maximum
number of websites of BFIs of India (43) belonged to FB
category (42%). However, there were only 20 BFIs belong-
ing to PSBs, whose websites were also part of the study.
Websites of BFIs and the W3C
Validation Results
To test hypothesis and answer the research questions related
to W3C guidelines followed by BFIs in India, the data gath-
ered using the online research tools provided by W3C were
analyzed using SPSS. During the study, analysis in terms of
the link of the website design of the BFIs with other search
engines and websites, markup language, Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) validation, and accessibility tests were done.
The result of the same is depicted in Table 3.
Table 3 shows that majority of the websites (69.9%) of the
BFIs in India had website link errors, thus causing problems
in the links to search engines and other website links for the
users. In fact, only a few (6.7%) of the BFIs in India had

websites without markup errors, resulting in making the
websites extremely difficult to maintain, apply style or lay-
out, consistently across platforms.
The BFI websites were tested in terms of CSS. It was
found that majority (74.75%) of the websites had errors mak-
ing browsing of web pages through all the Internet and mobile
phone platforms difficult to the customers, thus decreasing
the use. The result of the professional website accessibility
test using "A Checker" showed that only 14.5% of Indian
BFIs websites passed the test, thus proving that most of the
websites of BFIs are inaccessible to PWDs. However, eight
BFIs belonging to public sector had passed the test ensuring
the financial inclusion through their website.
Accessibility Features as Depicted in
the Websites of BFIs in India
To test hypothesis and answer the research questions related
to accessibility of the websites of BFIs in India, data col-
lected using the online research tools provided were gathered
and the same were analyzed using SPSS. During the study, as
per the objective to demonstrate the design of the websites,
an analysis in terms of the website design with "F" pattern,
mobile phone compatibility, vernacular language choice,
online savings bank account opening facility, mobile and the
Internet banking facility, disability-specific graphics and
alternative text for image, W3C compliance was done. The
result of the same is depicted in Table 4.
The researcher has concentrated on the "F"-shaped read-
ing pattern while studying design (Nielsen, 2006). For this,
the researcher has captured a screenshot of the home page of
every website and overlaid "F" shape on top of it, just below
the masthead of the website. However, the reading patterns
of the PWDs are also being considered. Eye-tracking visual-
ization shows that user of a website gaze at "F"-shaped pat-
tern: two horizontal stripes followed by a vertical stripe, "F"
for fast. That is how users read the website content. Their
eyes move at amazing speeds in a few seconds across the
website's word, in a pattern that is very different from what
one learned in school. However, website reading pattern of
PWDs is a matter for research. This research study has not
made an attempt in this direction. In Table 4, it may be
observed that majority of the websites (66%) of the BFIs in
India had "F" pattern, enabling easy reading for the users.
However, only few (17%) of the BFIs in India had mobile
phone compatibility, resulting in losing out a huge popula-
tion unable to use the mobile phone in viewing the banking
website and its facilities. Even though majority (60%) of the
BFIs operating in India belonged to the public and private
sector, vernacular language facility was offered by only 28%
of the BFIs. Thus, losing out on rural banking customers,
who might understand only the vernacular language. The
disability-specific graphics or alternative text to images in
the website was offered only by 9.7% of the BFIs in India,
thus limiting the use of the website by visually challenged
customers. Among the 103 websites of BFIs in India, only 11
website had full compliance as per the norms of W3C.
Interactive and Participative Features
Depicted in the Website of BFIs in
India
If website is the face of an organization in the new medium,
its global reachability can be only assessed based on its
accessibility. W3C compliance remains the qualification for
any website that can be easily accessible by banking custom-
ers. During the research study, as per the objective, the
researchers made exclusive study of the interactive and par-
ticipative features of the websites of BFIs in India.
In Table 5, it is found that online insurance facility was
provided only by few (20%) BFIs in India. This is another
area for further research. Web accessibility for a BFI in India
means those customers with disabilities can perceive, under-
stand, navigate, and interact with the websites. Majority
(71%) of the BFIs in India provided social media links to
their websites increasing their reach and presence.
One of the good features of a website is to provide forms for
visitors to contact, complaint, or to give feedback. Provision of
list of ATMs (automated teller machines) and branches, online
complaint redresses system, and search engine in the websites
of BFIs makes it an interactive and participatory platform. This
means PWDs could access the website and need not waste their
time and energy travelling in search of the nearest BFIs for
their financial needs solutions and transactions.

The website components have a relationship with the other.
It may be at various points of usage or production. It begins at
the developer level during production and then finally ends at
the user level. During the process there are various compo-
nents that take care of the continuous relationship between
developers. It includes authoring tools, evaluation tools, con-
tent, browsers, media players, and assisting technologies.
This relationship can be explained through Figure 2
(Mathew Martin, 2009, p. 55).
Hence, it is imperative that each component is taken care to
keep the relationship while designing the website. Developer
should always keep in mind the end user of the website while
designing the same. In the case of websites developed by BFIs
in India, accessibility should be one of the main components
which needs to be taken care to ensure financial inclusion for
all. To enable accessibility, assistive technologies come to the
rescue of the developer and the user of the website. In fact,
according to Jane Seale (2010) digital inclusion is broadly
understood as "a phenomenon whereby PWDs are able to
access and meaningfully participate in the same financial,
employment, social and citizenship activities as others."
Conclusion
Even though there is a lot yet to be done by BFIs in India in
increasing web accessibility, some laudable efforts have
been made to use this new medium with global and local
reach for financial inclusion. A good website of BFIs in
India, to promote financial inclusion for PWDs, would
include all possible features of accessibility, participation,
information, and networking. These BFIs cannot afford to
ignore the large population of the Internet users among
PWDs. The website of Bank of India (BOI; http://www.
bankofindia.co.in), one of largest public sector banks, ranks
highest in terms of several accessible features available fol-
lowed by the website of https://www.sc.com/.
The most surprising finding from the quantitative part of
the study is that majority of the content in the website of
these organizations was about information regarding the
financial instruments aspects, instead of services for custom-
ers of BFIs. The front page of most of websites of BFIs in
India is organizational centric. The most glaring aspect in
this study is the lack of vernacular/local language version of
the websites of BFIs in India. In this study, it is demonstrated
that very few of the websites have the links to new interac-
tive and social communication tools like social media links,
guest books, and Really Simple Syndicate (RSS) feeds.
Majority of them (63.1%) do not even have feedback or com-
plaint form details (Table 5). Some websites of the BFIs in
India are not convergent in nature. It needs mentioning that
the BFIs should have a continuous interactive website with
accessibility, participation, information, and networking
instead of the more common "brochure" or information sites.
However, it is encouraging to note that on "World
Disability Day," that is, December 3, 2013, some of the web-
sites of BFIs in India had accessible features. The details of
the analysis and results are given in Annexure 1. The acces-
sible features decreased the digital divide between the PWDs
and the BFIs offering banking and financial services in India.
