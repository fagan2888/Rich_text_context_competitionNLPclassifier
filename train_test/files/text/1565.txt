Low-level Population Exposure to Inorganic Arsenic in the
United States and Diabetes Mellitus
A Reanalysis
Craig Steinmaus,a,b Yan Yuan,b Jane Liaw,b and Allan H. Smithb
Background: Although studies have reported associations between
high concentrations of ingested inorganic arsenic and diabetes mel-
litus, there is no evidence of this association at low exposures.
However, a well-publicized study (JAMA. 2008;300:814­822) re-
cently produced an extraordinary finding of a more than 3-fold
increase in diabetes at low concentrations of urinary arsenic. This
potentially affects 40 million adults in the United States.
Methods: We used the same cross-sectional data on urinary arsenic
and type 2 diabetes mellitus in 795 adults from the 2003­2004
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to assess this
evidence.
Results: As in the earlier study, we found an odds ratio (OR) near 1.0
for diabetes, comparing the 80th versus 20th percentiles of urinary total
arsenic (OR  0.88 95% confidence interval  0.39­1.97). This OR
increased to above 3.0 when urinary arsenobetaine was added to the
logistic risk model. However, this high OR was a statistical artifact
because arsenobetaine, which is ingested from fish and is essentially
nontoxic, is a part of measured total urinary arsenic. These 2 variables
are highly correlated (correlation  0.80). Because arsenobetaine is a
part of total arsenic, it should first be subtracted from total arsenic rather
than being added to the statistical model. Doing so yields an OR of 1.15
(0.53­2.50).
Conclusion: These findings show no evidence of increased risk of
diabetes with arsenic exposure in this dataset. This underscores the
importance of valid statistical techniques and careful consideration
of scientific plausibility when investigating low-concentration
chemical exposures.

Arsenic is found in the environment in 2 general forms:
inorganic and organic. Inorganic arsenic causes cancers
of the lung, bladder, and skin, as well as skin lesions,
cardiovascular diseases, and reproductive effects.1 Tens of
millions of people worldwide are exposed to inorganic ar-
senic, mostly from naturally contaminated drinking water.2 In
the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has
estimated that 25% of all public water systems have arsenic
concentrations between 5 and 10 g/L, with most of the
remaining systems having lower concentrations.3 Inorganic
arsenic in the environment exists in 2 different valence states:
arsenous acid and arsenic acid. The metabolic pathway of
ingested arsenous acid and arsenic acid in humans is meth-
ylation, first to monomethylarsonic acid and then to dimethy-
larsonic acid,4 although the ability of people to do this varies
widely.5 Inorganic arsenic and its metabolites are excreted in
the urine, and the sum of their urinary concentrations is
commonly used to assess inorganic arsenic exposure.1
Exposure to organic arsenic comes primarily through
the consumption of seafood, and these forms are rapidly
excreted and believed to be nontoxic.6,7 The most common
form of organic arsenic found in seafood and in human
urine is arsenobetaine, although other organic arsenic com-
pounds (including arsenocholine and other arsenosugars)
are also present.
Several studies in populations exposed to high concentra-
tions of inorganic arsenic in drinking water (mostly above 500
g/L) have reported associations between these exposures and type
2 diabetes mellitus (eTable; http://links.lww.com/EDE/A333).8
Currently, there is no clear evidence that this association also
occurs at lower concentrations such as those commonly found
in the United States. Recently, a published study reported an
odds ratio (OR) for type 2 diabetes mellitus of 3.58 (95%
confidence interval CI  1.18 ­10.8) for United States
subjects at the 80th percentile of urinary total arsenic con-
centrations compared with those at the 20th percentile.9
Importantly, this study involved subjects from the 2003­2004
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), which is designed to provide a nationally repre-
sentative sample of all noninstitutionalized people in the
United States. This finding, if true, would be extraordinary
because it would suggest that over 40 million adults in this

country (those in the highest 20% of exposure) have a more
than 3-fold increased risk of this highly prevalent and serious
disease due to arsenic exposure. This finding was reported by
major news outlets, including CNN, US News and World
Report, and USA Today.10­12 However, if this result is not
correct, then scientific attention, research resources, and public
health concern could be inappropriately diverted from other,
more important issues.
Analyses of the health effects of inorganic arsenic using
data from NHANES 2003­2004 are complicated by the fact
that most subjects have very low urinary levels of inorganic
arsenic. Another complicating factor is the presence of uri-
nary arsenobetaine and other nontoxic organic forms of
arsenic. In the aforementioned analysis of the NHANES
2003­2004 data,9 these issues were addressed by removing
people with recent seafood consumption, and by calculating
ORs for type 2 diabetes mellitus and total urinary arsenic
(organic  inorganic forms) using logistic regression models
that included arsenobetaine and mercury (another indicator of
seafood consumption). This method could lead to an impor-
tant error: arsenobetaine is a part of total arsenic and these 2
variables are highly correlated. Entering 2 highly correlated
variables into the same regression model can cause unstable
results and lead to incorrect conclusions.13­15 To avoid this
problem, we obtained an estimate of inorganic arsenic expo-
sure by subtracting arsenobetaine from total arsenic. This
method directly removes any effects that may be caused by
the most common form of organic arsenic. It also prevents
aberrant findings that may result from entering both total
arsenic and one of its major components (arsenobetaine) into
the same logistic regression model.
METHODS
Study Population
The data for this study were obtained from NHANES
2003­2004, which is a national survey conducted by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and involving
10,122 people who were selected using a multistage proba-
bility sampling design.16 In NHANES 2003­2004, urinary
levels of total arsenic and various forms of inorganic and
organic arsenic were analyzed in a representative one-third
subsample (n  2673) of subjects aged 6 years and older. The
NHANES 2003­2004 study was approved by the National
Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board.
Exclusion Criteria
For our study, the following exclusion criteria were
applied. First, since our focus was on type 2 diabetes mellitus
(which more commonly affects adults) we excluded 1062
subjects under the age of 20. Second, we excluded 584
subjects who did not fast for 8­24 hours before blood
collection, 38 women who were pregnant, and 34 subjects
missing arsenic speciation data. Third, we excluded 24 sub-
jects without serum glucose measurements and without a
self-reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fourth, we
excluded 133 subjects who reported seafood consumption in
their first-day dietary survey, to reduce the contribution of
organic arsenic in fish to total urine arsenic concentrations.
Three subjects who had urinary arsenobetaine levels greater
than total arsenic levels were excluded as this would have
caused negative values for our estimates of inorganic arsenic.
Finally, in the adjusted logistic regression analysis, 12 addi-
tional people were excluded because of missing data on
covariates. These are the same exclusion criteria as in the
previous analysis9 except that we did not remove the 4
subjects with missing data on glycated hemoglobin (because
we did not analyze this variable), but we removed 3 addi-
tional people with seafood consumption due to slight differ-
ences in how seafood was defined.
Laboratory Analysis
The methods used to collect and perform all laboratory
analyses are detailed elsewhere.17 Briefly, spot urine samples
were collected from all subjects, and shipped on dry ice and
stored frozen at 70°C.18 Total urine arsenic concentrations
were measured at the National Center for Environmental Health,
using inductively coupled-plasma dynamic reaction cell-mass
spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS) on a PerkinElmer ELAN DRC
Plus or ELAN DRC II ICP-MS (PerkinElmer SCIEX, Concord,
ON, Canada). The concentrations of speciated arsenic were
determined using high-performance liquid chromatography to
separate the species and ICP-DRC-MS for detection. The inter-
assay coefficient of variation for bench quality control sam-
ples run throughout the study was 9.2% for total arsenic for
lots with a mean total arsenic of 8.15 g/L. The interassay
coefficients of variation for bench quality control samples
with a mean arsenobetaine of 4.87 g/L and samples with a
mean dimethylarsonic acid of 6.66 g/L were 10.1% and
6.5%, respectively.19,20 Detection limits in g/L were 0.6 for
total arsenic, 1.2 for arsenous acid, 1.0 for arsenic acid, 0.4
for arsenobetaine, 0.6 for arsenocholine, 1.7 for dimethylar-
sonic acid, and 0.9 for monomethylarsonic acid. Urinary
creatinine concentrations were measured using a Jaffe
´ rate
reaction and a CX3 analyzer (Beckman Instruments Inc,
Brea, CA). Serum cotinine was measured using an isotope-
dilution-high-performance liquid chromatography or at-
mospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spec-
trometric method, and serum glucose was measured using
a Beckman Synchron LX20 (Beckman Coulter Inc, Fuller-
ton, CA).
Other Data
NHANES questionnaire data included self-reported in-
formation on sociodemographic variables and on medical and
smoking history. Diet information was collected using a
24-hour dietary recall, and seafood was defined as any food
item containing fish or shellfish. We defined people with type

2 diabetes mellitus as those who reported they had been told
by a health care professional that they had diabetes or who
reported taking insulin or diabetic pills. Subjects who had a
fasting serum glucose greater than 125 mg/dL were also
defined as having type 2 diabetes mellitus.21 This was the
same definition used in the earlier report.9
Statistical Analysis
Because many subjects had levels of arsenous acid,
arsenic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid below detection
limits, the concentration of inorganic arsenic and its metab-
olites was estimated by subtracting the concentration of the
measured forms of organic arsenic (arsenobetaine and arseno-
choline) from the concentration of total arsenic. Earlier stud-
ies have shown that arsenobetaine makes up the majority of
organic arsenic in most common seafood (the primary source
of human exposure) and the majority of organic arsenic
commonly found in human urine.6,7,22
Initially, analyses were conducted of the relationship
between diabetes mellitus and individual variables, including
total arsenic, arsenobetaine, dimethylarsonic acid, estimated
inorganic arsenic, and other factors that might be related to
diabetes or arsenic exposure. Similar analyses were done to
assess the association between these variables and other
factors that may be related to diabetes or arsenic exposure.
Using logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs)
and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for type 2 diabetes
mellitus and total arsenic, arsenobetaine, dimethylarsonic
acid, and estimated inorganic arsenic. Variables were not
logarithm transformed because logistic regression does not
require that the independent variables be normally distrib-
uted, and logarithmic values may distort dose-response rela-
tionships. As is standard in NHANES, the concentrations of
total arsenic and arsenobetaine below the detection limit were
assigned a value of the detection limit divided by the square
root of two. Assigning these a value of zero had little impact
on our results. Only 13 people had detectable levels of
arsenocholine, and so levels below detection were assigned a
value of zero. We calculated unadjusted ORs and also ORs
adjusted for potential confounding variables. These variables
included age (years), sex, race (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican-American, other), education (high
school, finished high school, high school), body mass index
(BMI; kg/m2), serum cotinine (ng/mL), urine albumin (g/
mL), blood mercury (g/L), urinary creatinine (mg/dl), and
the use of blood pressure medications (current use self-
reported as yes or no). We chose these variables because they
have been associated with the risks of diabetes or other
arsenic-related diseases, or with urinary concentrations of
glucose or arsenic in other studies.1,23 Age, BMI, blood
mercury, urinary creatinine, urinary albumin, and serum co-
tinine were entered as continuous variables. Entering these as
categorical variables had little impact on results. Blood mer-
cury and urine albumin had little effect and were removed
from the final analyses. In the past, dividing urinary arsenic
concentration by urinary creatinine concentration was a com-
mon way of adjusting for urine dilution.24 However, this can
have undesirable consequences, especially if creatinine is
related to the outcome of interest. Because patients with
diabetes have lower creatinine levels than nondiabetics,24 we
did not use this adjustment. We initially entered creatinine as
a continuous variable in the logistic regression models but did
not include it in the final results since it had little effect on our
findings. This is consistent with several previous studies
showing that creatinine adjustment does not improve arsenic
exposure estimates25­27 (creatinine-adjusted results are avail-
able at: http://asrg.berkeley.edu/research.html).
Odds ratios for the associations between type 2 diabetes
mellitus and total arsenic, arsenobetaine, dimethylarsonic acid,
and estimated inorganic arsenic were calculated for each tertile
or quintile using the lowest tertile or quintile as the reference.
The previous analysis of these data9 calculated odds ratios using
model-predicted odds at specific urinary arsenic levels. For
example, the odds ratio for the 80th versus 20th percentiles
was calculated as the odds predicted for a urine arsenic level
at the 80th percentile cut-off point divided by the odds
predicted for an arsenic level at the 20th percentile cut-off
point. We chose to base our comparison on actual arsenic
exposure categories (eg, we compare the odds in all subjects
above the 80th percentile to the odds in all subjects below the
20th percentile) because this allows presentation of easily
interpreted 2  2 table data and the development of odds
ratios based on actual data rather than model predictions.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS ver-
sion 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), and were done with
and without incorporating the NHANES sampling weights.
These weights are used to produce unbiased national esti-
mates, and reflect the unequal probabilities of selection,
nonresponse adjustments, and adjustments to independent
population controls.28 These weights had little effect on our
results. The results we present here are calculated without
weights, because our goal was not to produce nationally
representative estimates of population characteristics but
rather to assess a possible causal association.
RESULTS
Of the 2673 people with urine arsenic data in NHANES
2003­2004, 795 people met our inclusion criteria. Of these, a
total of 98 met our criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus: 77 had
a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes and 21 were categorized
as having diabetes based on their fasting serum glucose
measurement. Of the 795 subjects, the percentage with levels
below detection were: arsenous acid, 96%; arsenic acid, 93%;
dimethylarsonic acid, 15%; monomethylarsonic acid, 65%;
arsenobetaine, 33%; and arsenocholine, 98%.
Table 1 shows the number of people with and without
type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the means of the forms of

arsenic by age, sex, race, education, BMI, use of blood
pressure medication, and serum cotinine. The prevalence of
diabetes mellitus was associated with current use of blood
pressure medication (crude OR  4.6 95% CI  3.0­7.2)
and BMI (crude OR for BMI 30 vs. 25, 3.5 1.9­6.4).
The odds ratios for type 2 diabetes mellitus comparing
people above the upper 80th percentile of each arsenic form
with subjects below the 20th percentile, and comparing peo-
ple in the upper and middle tertiles with those in the lower
tertiles, are shown in Table 2. For total arsenic, the adjusted
odds ratio for type 2 diabetes mellitus for those above the
80th percentile compared with those below the 20th percen-
tile was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.39 ­1.97). Entering the logarithm of
urinary arsenobetaine and creatinine into this model with total
arsenic, as done by Navas-Acien et al,9 produced an odds
ratio for diabetes above 3.0 (Table 3). However, this large
increase is due to arsenobetaine being part of total urinary
arsenic, which results in collinearity from a strong correlation
between total arsenic and arsenobetaine. The Spearman and
Pearson correlation coefficients between urinary levels of
total arsenic and arsenobetaine were 0.71 and 0.96, respec-
tively. The Figure provides a plot of these variables, illus-
trating the strong correlation between them. After adjusting
for urinary creatinine, the Pearson correlation coefficient was
0.80 between total arsenic and arsenobetaine (both log-trans-
formed) and 0.49 between inorganic arsenic and arsenobe-
taine (both log-transformed). The corresponding R2 values
were 0.64 and 0.24, respectively.
For our estimate of inorganic arsenic, the adjusted odds
ratio for type 2 diabetes mellitus for those above the 80th

percentile compared with those below the 20th percentile was
1.15 (0.53­2.50) (Table 2). No clear trend was seen in the
analysis involving tertiles. For dimethylarsonic acid (the most
common form of inorganic arsenic) the type 2 diabetes mellitus
odds ratio comparing subjects above the 80th percentile with
those below the 20th percentile was 1.05 (0.45­2.44).
The differences between our results and those of the
previous analysis of these data are shown in Table 3. When
we repeated the analyses using the same methods used by
Navas-Acien et al,9 we obtained results similar to theirs. For
example, the diabetes odds ratio comparing the model-pre-
dicted odds at the 80th and 20th percentiles of total arsenic
adjusted for the logarithms of arsenobetaine, blood mercury,
and urine creatinine was 3.58 (1.18­10.83) in their analysis
and 3.57 (1.28­9.95) in ours. The corresponding odds ratios
without arsenobetaine and mercury were 1.05 (0.57­1.94) in
their analysis and 1.06 (0.61­1.86) in ours. The minor differ-
ences are probably due to differences in the statistical programs
(R vs. SAS) and the fact that we did not exactly replicate the
number of people they removed due to recent seafood consump-
tion (we removed 133 and they removed 130).
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest no identifiable association between
type 2 diabetes mellitus and urinary inorganic arsenic in the
general United States population using NHANES data. We
computed an odds ratio for diabetes mellitus of 1.15 (0.53­
2.50) for subjects with estimated urinary inorganic arsenic
levels above the 80th percentile compared with those with
levels below the 20th percentile, and similar odds ratios near

1.0 in our analysis of estimated inorganic arsenic tertiles.
These findings are not unexpected, given the very low arsenic
levels seen in the large majority of the NHANES subjects.
The clearest evidence linking inorganic arsenic in
drinking water to diabetes risks in previous studies comes
from investigations in which many people were exposed to
arsenic concentrations above 500 g/L. These levels are
about 10­30 times higher than those found in the top 20th
percentile of the 2003­2004 NHANES subjects.29­35 (A
supplemental table reviewing this previous research is avail-
able at: http://asrg.berkeley.edu/.) The relatively modest rel-
ative risks seen in these high exposure studies suggest that if
arsenic did increase the risk of diabetes mellitus at common
United States exposure levels (ie, water concentrations less
than 10 g/L), this effect would be undetectable in epidemi-
ologic studies. Identifying associations where relative risks
are expected to be low requires very large studies for ade-
quate statistical power. It also requires very accurate data on
exposure and potential confounders, which are more likely to
have important effects on study results and conclusions when
relative risks are low than when they are high.36 Because of
these issues, identifying an association between arsenic and
diabetes mellitus in a general low-exposure population is
likely not possible, even if the association were real.
One potential problem in using NHANES 2003­2004
data to investigate the health effects of arsenic is that only a
single spot urine sample was collected from each subject.
Urinary arsenic levels can vary over time within an individual
if that person consumes water from different sources with
different arsenic concentrations. This is especially important
in diseases such as diabetes, which may take years to develop.
The use of a single urine sample would lead to misclassifi-
cation of arsenic exposure in some subjects. Similar bias
could also occur from inaccuracies in diagnosing diabetes,
including errors in self-reported diagnoses or day-to-day
variability in serum glucose. Because information about dia-
betes and arsenic exposure were collected similarly in all
individuals, the resulting bias from these factors is most
likely nondifferential and thus toward the null. The use of
cross-sectional data also raises questions about the temporal
relationship between diabetes and urinary arsenic, although
we are not aware of any data suggesting that diabetes causes
a change in arsenic excretion. In contrast, past studies linking
high levels of arsenic and diabetes, in which arsenic exposure
was estimated mostly by using drinking water concentrations
rather than urine, provide a fairly substantial body of evi-
dence for the temporal relationship of high levels of arsenic
ingestion resulting in an increased prevalence of diabetes.
Inaccuracies may have also been introduced by the fact
that many subjects had levels of inorganic arsenic metabolites
below detection. It is possible that our method of subtracting
arsenobetaine and arsenocholine from total arsenic to esti-
mate inorganic arsenic did not remove all forms of organic
arsenic in some individuals. However, most evidence sug-
gests that the remaining amount of organic arsenic is likely to
be small. Some types of seafood contain arsenosugars that are
distinct from arsenobetaine and arsenocholine, and some of
these are metabolized to dimethylarsonic acid in humans, but
these types of seafood (mussels, clams, seaweed, algae) are
likely eaten only rarely and only by a relatively small per-
centage of the general NHANES population. Thus, the effect
of these on our results is likely to be small. Most evidence
suggests that arsenobetaine accounts for most of the organic
arsenic in food.7,22,37­40 These data also show that arsenobe-
taine is excreted mostly unchanged in human urine and is the
most common organic form of arsenic in background samples
of human urine.
We assessed the possibility that our estimate of inor-
ganic arsenic was inaccurate due to the presence of unac-
counted-for forms of organic arsenic, by calculating the
percentage of total arsenic that was present as arsenous acid,
arsenic acid, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsonic acid,
trimethylarsine oxide, arsenobetaine, and arsenocholine. Ini-
tially, in subjects who had levels of these metabolites below
detection, we assigned values that were at the level of
detection divided by the square root of 2. When this was
done, the sum of the individual inorganic and organic metab-
olites was on average greater than 100% of the concentration
of total arsenic. If measurements below detection are set at
zero, this percentage averaged 75% (52% inorganic forms
and 23% organic forms).
The finding that arsenobetaine adjustment causes a
large change in the diabetes OR for total arsenic is consistent
with the R2 values for these variables. The R2 values we
calculated show that arsenobetaine accounts for 64% of the
variance in total arsenic but only 24% of the variance in our
estimate of inorganic arsenic. The correlation between our
estimate of inorganic arsenic and arsenobetaine is probably

due to some dimethylarsonic acid and some other arsenosug-
ars that are present in the same seafoods that contain arseno-
betaine. When we entered total arsenic and arsenobetaine into
the same model used in the previous analysis of these data,
we obtained a diabetes odds ratio of 3.57 comparing the 80th
to 20th percentiles of total arsenic--virtually the same as the
OR of 3.58 obtained by Navas-Acien et al (our Table 3).
However, the strong correlation between total arsenic and
arsenobetaine, and our findings of odds ratios near 1.0 when
arsenobetaine was subtracted from total arsenic, show that
this high odds ratio is an artifact resulting from incorporating
both total urinary arsenic and arsenobetaine (which is part of
total urinary arsenic) into the same mathematical model. A
correct analysis of the data shows there is no evidence of
increased diabetes prevalence with increasing urinary inor-
ganic arsenic in this dataset.
In summary, our analysis did not produce evidence that
the low levels of arsenic exposure commonly found in the
United States are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
This result is consistent with previous studies on arsenic and
diabetes, which show mostly modest increases in relative risk
at exposure levels that are much higher than found in our
study. The greater than 3-fold increase in risk seen in the
previous analysis of the NHANES dataset resulted from

inappropriately entering arsenobetaine into the same logistic
risk model with total urinary arsenic (which includes arseno-
betaine). Our findings and those of Navas-Acien et al illus-
trate the difficulties encountered when investigating low ex-
posure levels commonly seen in large population surveys
such as NHANES. This paper underscores the importance of
careful statistical analyses and a thorough consideration of
scientific plausibility and bias when planning or conducting
investigations of very low chemical exposures. Accurately
evaluating type 2 diabetes mellitus at exposure levels in the
general United States population would likely have to involve
unusually large and prohibitively expensive studies. Given
this, and given that the evidence linking arsenic exposures
above 200 g/L to diabetes mellitus is fairly strong, the next
logical step for investigating diabetes-arsenic relationships
epidemiologically would be to focus on moderate exposure
levels (eg, about 50­200 g/L in drinking water). Studies of
arsenic below the current drinking water standard of 10 g/L
(experienced by most of the United States population) would
be warranted if clearly increased risks could first be demon-
strated in populations exposed to water containing arsenic
concentrations of 50­200 g/L.
