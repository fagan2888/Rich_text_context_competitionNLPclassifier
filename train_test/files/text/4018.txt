Although virtually all aspire to consummate romantic love,
the path toward achieving the ideal love relationship is lit-
tered with relationships that are incomplete approximations.
Many of these are discarded, whereas some relationships are
maintained in spite of their imperfections. The prototype of
consummate romantic love is that it will be reciprocal, ful-
filling, and enduring (e.g., Aron & Aron, 1986, 1996) and
trusting, caring, and, intimate (Fehr, 2006). Unrequited love
(UL) occurs when differences in the aspirations or the expe-
riences of love result in a yearning for more complete love by
one of the individuals in the relationship. The experience of
UL may be an ephemeral mood state, a developmental stage
in a relationship, idiosyncratic to the combination of two
individuals, or the result of a stable attribute (e.g., anxious/
ambivalent attachment; Aron, Aron, & Allen, 1998). UL has
been found to be more prevalent among individuals who
reported an anxious/ambivalent attachment style (Aron et al.,
1998) and who were low on defensiveness (K. K. Dion &
Dion, 1975). This research is focused on evaluating the ques-
tion of whether or not UL is a type of romantic love and the
ways in which UL aligns with the attributes of romantic love.
Types of UL
Baumeister, Wotman, and Stillwell (1993) described several
ways in which UL can develop (e.g., growing out of friend-
ship, loving from afar) and Aron and Aron (1991) described
three types of UL (secret, jilted, hanger on). We conceptual-
ized UL as occurring in different kinds of relationships that
are assumed to be located on a continuum of interdepen-
dence (e.g., Kelley et al., 1983; Kelley et al., 2003; see also
Baumeister et al., 1993). Interdependence encompasses
influence, behavioral control, and the frequency, diversity,
and length of interaction (Berscheid, Snyder, & Omoto,
2004). Berscheid and Ammazzalorso (2001) posited that
increasing interdependency creates stronger, more numer-
ous, and more consequential expectations that, when vio-
lated, produce stronger emotional reactions. An extreme
example of a relationship with low interdependence is an
imaginary lover. A love relationship that is equal in
exchanges encompasses high levels of interdependence
(e.g., Kelley et al., 1983; Kelley et al., 2003). This contin-
uum of presumed interdependence organizes the following
types of UL relationships.
Crush on Someone Who Is Unavailable
Someone can have a crush on a love object who exists, but
who is seldom proximal (e.g., a rock star, a movie star). The
person has little or no chance of forming an equal, reciprocal
relationship because the love object is unavailable. There are
often large disparities between the two persons in their desir-
ability and the desirability of their alternatives, decreasing

The Prevalence and Nature
of Unrequited Love
Robert G. Bringle1,2, Terri Winnick2,3 and Robert J. Rydell4
Abstract
Unrequited love (UL) is unreciprocated love that causes yearning for more complete love. Five types of UL are delineated
and conceptualized on a continuum from lower to greater levels of interdependence: crush on someone unavailable, crush
on someone nearby, pursuing a love object, longing for a past lover, and an unequal love relationship. Study 1a found all types
of UL relationships to be less emotionally intense than equal love and 4 times more frequent than equal love during a 2-year
period. Study 1b found little evidence for limerent qualities of UL. Study 2 found all types of UL to be less intense than equal
love on passion, sacrifice, dependency, commitment, and practical love, but more intense than equal love on turmoil. These
results suggest that UL is not a good simulation of true romantic love, but an inferior approximation of that ideal.

the prospect of a reciprocal, romantic relationship (Berscheid
& Reis, 1998). Furthermore, relationships that might form
are superficial, asymmetrical, and incomplete (e.g., talking at
an autograph session, a one-night sexual relationship). Thus,
the love object is more accessible to, more important to, and
exercises more behavioral control over the enamored than
vice versa. However, there is interdependence. As Ferris
(2001) documented, fans collect information about their par-
amours, experience emotions when good and bad events
occur in the paramour's life, alter their behavior to be near
the paramour (e.g., go to concerts) (Spitzberg & Cupach,
2007). Furthermore, the star's behavior can be influenced by
fans (e.g., changing behavior to appeal to them).
Crush on Someone Nearby Without Initiating a
Romantic Relationship
Some potential romantic partners may be physically nearby.
Awareness may be unilateral or mutual (Levinger & Snoek,
1972). Because of the person's proximity, interdependence
can be greater than that for the previous type. The presence
of the love object may influence the enamored person's
behavior (e.g., attempts at contact are made). There can be
interaction, which may be perfunctory and contain no disclo-
sure of romantic interests, or the relationship may develop
into a friendship without clear revelation of romantic inter-
ests (Baumeister & Wotman, 1992).
Pursuing the Love Object
At some point, the enamored may decide to initiate a
romantic relationship, either through somewhat passive
routes (increasing contact, ambiguous statements), or more
active communication of romantic interests (asking for a
date). The intentions may or may not be accurately per-
ceived by the love object (Baumeister & Wotman, 1992),
resulting in varying degrees of emotions and differences in
expectations for the future of the romantic relationship
(Arriaga, 2001).
The attraction can be rather sudden (which Shaver,
Morgan, & Wu, 1996, describe as a love surge) and the "love
struck" person assumes the task of communicating romantic
intentions, eliciting reciprocation, and initiating a romantic
relationship (Baumeister & Wotman, 1992). Alternatively,
unilateral romantic inclinations can develop within the con-
text of a friendship. In either case, the fate of the relationship
likely depends on many factors (e.g., clear communication,
availability of the prospective partner). Barelds and Barelds-
Dijkstra (2007) found that partners who "fell in love at first
sight" had more dissimilar personalities than those who fell in
love more gradually. In addition, differences in desirable
qualities may result in the person "falling upward" (i.e.,
attempting to initiate a relationship with someone of greater
overall desirability) to be thwarted by the more desirable per-
son (Baumeister & Wotman, 1992). Thus, one consequence
of expressed romantic interests may be that they are either
initially or regularly rejected. However, the UL relationship
may blend into the courtship process in which the couple pur-
sues a romantic relationship (Cate & Lloyd, 1992).
Longing for a Past Lover
Dissolution of a relationship is often not mutual (Davis, Ace,
& Andra, 2002; Hill, Rubin, & Peplau, 1976). In contrast to
those who leave a dating partner, those who are committed to
a deteriorating relationship continue to invest in the relation-
ship, find the relationship satisfying, devalue alternative
relationships, stalk, and profess commitment after the rela-
tionship dissolves (Meloy & Fisher, 2005; Rusbult, 1983).
Because there once was a relationship, there was a rather
high level of interdependence, including familiarity with and
knowledge of the love object. Thus, individuals who are left
by a lover can harbor lingering feelings of attraction for their
past lover, longing for the resumption of the relationship
(Baumeister & Wotman, 1992; Sprecher, Felmlee, Metts,
Fehr, & Vanni, 1998; Wegner & Gold, 1995). "Frustration
attraction" may have a biological basis that explains why
rejection produces more passion (Fisher, 2004), and attempts
to reestablish the relationship can intensify into stalking
(Davis et al., 2002).
Unequal Love Relationship
Once a romantic relationship has been initiated, there may be
differences in the intensity of love, in the nature of the love
experienced by the two individuals, or differences in the
expectations about the pace of relationship development.
Quantitative asymmetry refers to differences in the intensity
of the love experienced or differences in the various dimen-
sions of intensity, such as onset latency, duration, action
readiness, and overall intensity (Arriaga, 2001; Frijda,
Ortony, Sonnemans, & Clore, 1992).
Qualitative asymmetry occurs when two individuals
obtain different types of outcomes from a relationship. Love
can involve numerous distinct qualities, such as passion, inti-
macy, and commitment (Sternberg, 1986); attachment, care-
giving, and sexuality (Shaver & Hazan, 1988; Shaver &
Mikulincer, 2006; Shaver, Morgan, & Wu, 1996); passionate
and companionate love (Berscheid & Walster, 1978); caring
and needing (Kelley et al., 1983); and mixes of eros, ludus,
and storge (C. Hendrick & Hendrick, 2006; Lee, 1973, 1988).
An imbalance can occur in any of these qualitative aspects of
love. For example, a lover can be dissatisfied because high
passion and low commitment are experienced and desired
from the partner, but the partner experiences and seeks low
passion and high commitment (Regan, 1998).
Bringle et al. 3
Study 1a
Baumeister et al. (1993) reported the prevalence of three
types of quantitatively differentiated UL experiences: a casual
attraction; a moderate attraction; and a powerful, intense, and
serious attraction. During a 5-year span, college respondents
reported 1.07 "powerful," 1.86 "moderate," and 3.66 "casual"
instances of UL. Their definition of UL was, "you have been
attracted to another person, but that other person did not feel
an equal attraction to you" (Baumeister et al., 1993, p. 386).
This description could encompass all five types of UL rela-
tionships described earlier, with the possible exception of a
crush on an unavailable love object. Hill, Blakemore, and
Drumm (1997) studied mostly young adults (M age = 23
years) and found that the frequency of UL was significantly
higher for males (3.06) than the frequency of mutual love in
males (2.26), and higher than UL for females (1.62, which
was significantly lower than mutual love for females: 2.50).
Study 1a sought descriptive information about the preva-
lence of ULby measuring the frequency and intensity of the five
types of UL relationships and equal, reciprocated love. Because
UL is an "easy" kind of love (low investment, low interdepen-
dence; Baumeister et al., 1993), UL was expected to be more
frequent than equal love. Because equal love is emotionally ful-
filling love (Aron & Aron, 1986), and because Berscheid and
Ammazzalorso (2001) predicted more intense emotional
responses for more interdependent relationships, the general
intensity of the emotional experience for equal love was hypoth-
esized to be greater than that for UL and to be greater for types
of UL with presumed higher interdependency.
Method
Participants. Respondents were 153 high school students (60
males, 93 females) and 165 university students (54 males,
111 females), aged 14 to 63 years (M = 21.1, SD = 9.42).
University students were given extra credit in a psychology
course for their participation.
Questionnaire.The questionnaire presented descriptions of
six different types of love relationships:
1. A huge "crush" on someone you do not know person-
ally, nor ever really expect to know, like a movie star,
rock star, or athlete.
2. A huge crush on someone you know, but for one rea-
son or another you have not let that person know of
your feelings for him or her.
3. A relationship in which you are (were) actually pur-
suing the person you are (were) in love with, but so
far have been unsuccessful in winning that person's
love in return.
4. A love relationship that has ended for whatever rea-
son, but one in which you still long for that partner
although there is no prospect of reuniting.
5. A love relationship in which you are (were) currently
involved romantically, but one in which you feel that
you love the partner more, were more committed to,
and put more effort into the relationship than did your
partner.
6. A love relationship involving an equal love--rela-
tionships in which you are (or were) in love with
someone who loves (or loved) you just as much in
return.
Respondent were asked to consider instances of love in
the last 2 years. A period of 2 years was selected because
high school students were included in the sample and a lon-
ger time frame might have included years during which they
had little interest in romantic relationships. Respondents
were asked to indicate all instances of each type of love rela-
tionship by writing the initials of the love object. For each
relationship listed, they were asked to indicate the age at
which the relationship began, the length of time that the
relationship lasted, whether it was a current relationship,
and the intensity of the feelings that they had for the love
object on a scale ranging from 1 (no feelings) to 7 (extremely
intense feelings).
Results
Two indices of frequency were examined: whether the
respondent reported any occurrence of a type of relationship
and the number of instances of each type of relationship (see
Table 1). Equal romantic love was experienced by 70% of
the sample during the past 2 years; respondents reported pur-
suing a relationship with someone for whom they had roman-
tic thoughts or feelings less frequently than they had those
feelings; and instances of all types of UL were over 4 times
more prevalent than equal love.
Due to the statistical interdependence of different types of
love (i.e., one participant could report on several different
types of love relationships or more than one instance of the
same type of love relationship), it was not possible to con-
duct statistical analyses that assume either independent or
dependent observations. Therefore, a comparison of types of
relationships on intensity was conducted by computing a z
score for the mean intensity score for each UL group by
using the mean (M = 6.362) and standard deviation (.064) of
the equal love group (see Table 2). This method of analysis
provides a way to compare each type of UL with equal love
(e.g., the absolute value of the average z scores is an indica-
tor of the magnitude of difference), avoids the problems of
missing data and unequal occurrences of different types of
love relationships, and makes the results more readily inter-
pretable (J. Cohen & Cohen, 1975). Respondents reported
significantly lower intensity for each type of UL relationship
(z > 1.96), and the average intensity across all types of UL
was significantly lower than equal love.
4 SAGE Open
A similar analysis was conducted for duration. On the
questionnaire, respondents indicated if a relationship were
current and these relationships were excluded from this anal-
ysis of duration because they had not been terminated.
Approximately one third of the respondents reported an
ongoing equal love relationship (.33), whereas the average
number of ongoing UL relationships per respondent was
lower (star = .16, nearby = .20, pursue = .06, unequal = .12,
long for = .04). However, the cumulative frequency of all
ongoing UL relationships (.59) was greater than equal love.
For those relationships that had ended, loving someone
nearby and pursuing someone were of shorter duration than
equal love (Table 2). A terminated relationship may have
started before the 2-year period; therefore, the relationship
duration could exceed 24 months. The other types of UL
relationships, and UL in general, were not markedly different
in duration from equal love.
Discussion
Study 1a assessed the prevalence and intensity of five differ-
ent types of UL and equal love occurring during a 2-year
period. Baumeister et al. (1993) found that 1.32 instances of
three intensities of UL per year were reported and Hill et al.
(1997) found 0.47 instances of UL per year were reported for
the 16- to 20-year age group. The current research found a
greater number of instances (1.91 reported instances of all
types of UL per year) than both of these studies. The higher
number in the current research may have resulted from the
multiple, specific prompts given to respondents for the dif-
ferent types of UL relationships. Nonetheless, the conclusion
from all three studies is that UL is common among young
adults.
In addition, UL was over 4 times more frequent than
equal love, which is very different from Hill et al.'s (1997)
study, in which the frequencies of UL and mutual love
were similar for the 16- to 20-year age group. Hill et al.
(1997) also reported the highest frequency of UL for the
16- to 20-year age group. One explanation for the higher
frequency in the current research is that equal love is more
enduring than UL. This is the case in general and, specifi-
cally, for two types of UL (nearby lover and pursued lover).
Duration was analyzed only for those relationships that
had terminated, which may disproportionately exclude
equal love relationships. However, the frequency of all
ongoing UL relationships exceeded ongoing equal love
relationships. The higher frequency of UL relationships,
then, is partially accounted for by their shorter duration,
but is not attributable to differential inclusion in the analy-
ses of duration.

Another factor that contributes to the higher frequency of
UL is that multiple instances were reported. Only 1 partici-
pant out of 104 reported two simultaneous, ongoing equal
love relationships. But equal love does not preclude the
experience of UL. Just more than 25% (n = 29) of those cur-
rently in equal love relationships also reported that they were
experiencing some form of UL. In addition, 33 participants
reported multiple ongoing UL relationships. Thus, UL rela-
tionships were more prevalent than equal love relationships
because they coexisted with other types of love relationships
during the sampled time frame.
As hypothesized, forms of UL that are presumed to be less
interdependent were more common. Consistent with
Berscheid and Ammazzalorso's (2001) theory, the pattern of
z scores supports the ordering of types of UL relationships
from highly interdependent to less interdependent because
those that are presumed to be more interdependent yielded
more intense emotions and were closer approximations to
equal love. In addition, UL, in terms of general emotional
responses, was less intense than equal love. This is consistent
with psychological theories of love that posit an emotionally
rich prototype of consummate love (e.g., Aron & Aron,
1986). However, this finding is inconsistent with conjectures
that emphasize how fantasy can feed UL (Berscheid &
Walster, 1978; Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996; Tennov,
1979), and how reality constraints can reduce the emotions
experienced in an actual relationship (Murray et al., 1996;
Tesser & Paulus, 1976).
Study 1b
Researchers typically define love in terms of the essential
characteristics of consummate romantic love (e.g., Aron &
Aron, 1986; Berscheid & Meyers, 1996; Fehr, 2006; Rubin,
1973; Shaver et al., 1996), not necessarily including those
qualities that may be typical of actual romantic relationships
that fall short of the ideal, prototype (Fehr, 1988), or para-
digm (Davis & Todd, 1982). Fehr's (1994) research illus-
trates the variety of attributes that can be associated with as
many as 15 types of love, not all of which are measured
adequately in romantic love scales.
Furthermore, there may be an important conceptual dis-
tinction between theories and descriptions of "love" and
theories and descriptions of "falling in love" (Aron, Dutton,
Aron, & Iverson, 1989; Berscheid & Meyers, 1996; Lamm &
Wiesmann, 1997), with the latter being more germane to
experiences of UL. For example, Aron et al. (1989) found
that accounts of falling in love failed to reflect some of the
qualities (arousal, perceived similarity) that are central to
typical conceptualizations of love.
Tennov's (1979) discussion of limerence identifies sev-
eral qualities that are not well captured in extant measures
of love and that are posited to be components of UL (see
also Baumeister et al., 1993; Baumeister & Wotman, 1992).
For example, her characterization of limerence details an
obsessive quality of intrusive thoughts about the love object.
However, there are divergent views in the literature concern-
ing how obsessiveness might be related to UL versus equal
love and how it might be related to the five types of UL in
this research. For example, Brehm (1992) speculated that
obsessiveness will be more likely when a person has little
real information about the love object. Thus, UL relation-
ships should possess greater obsessiveness than equal love
relationships and less interdependent types of UL should
show greater obsessiveness than more interdependent types.
However, Tesser and Paulus (1976) found positive associa-
tions between thoughts about the love object, contact with
the love object (dating), and reports of love. This would lead
to the expectation of greater obsessiveness in more interde-
pendent types of love relationships.
A second characteristic of limerence is idealizing or glori-
fying the love object. As Money (1980) noted, "the person
projects onto the partner an idealized and highly idiosyn-
cratic image that diverges from the image of that partner as
perceived by other people" (p. 65). Gaining information
about the love object that conflicts with idealized expecta-
tions should produce decreased idealization of the love
object (Murray et al., 1996; Tesser & Paulus, 1976).Although
Tesser and Paulus found little evidence that these reality con-
straints reduced love, this line of reasoning predicts that UL
relationships would exhibit greater idealization than equal
love relationships, and less interdependent types of UL rela-
tionships would exhibit more idealization than more interde-
pendent ones.
One quality about which the lover can idealize is the per-
ceived similarity between the self and the love object. In
interpersonal attraction research (e.g., Byrne, 1971), similar-
ity is a relatively powerful determinant of attraction.
Montoya, Horton, and Kirchner (2008) found in a meta-
analysis of research that perceived similarity was a signifi-
cant correlate of attraction across a wide range of relationship
types (e.g., limited interactions, short-term relationships,
existing relationships) and a better predictor of attraction
than actual similarity. Distortions of perceived similarity
could be easiest when there is scant information about the
love object. In the absence of accurate information conveyed
through firsthand experience and prolonged interactions, the
person loving from afar should be able to imagine that the
love object constitutes a perfect match. Therefore, UL (vs.
equal love) could be fueled by the perception of exaggerated
similarity and less interdependent types of UL relationships
would be most susceptible to this effect. The perceived
knowledge of the love object was predicted to show similar
results.
Baumeister et al. (1993) found that about half of their
enamored respondents reported diminished self-esteem and
feelings of inferiority as a result of their plight. Fiske and
Peterson (1991) found a positive association between depres-
sion and UL. Furthermore, Smith and Hokland (1988) found
that greater depression and anxiety, and lower self-confidence
6 SAGE Open
and well-being were more characteristic of UL relationships
than equal love relationships (see also Murray, Holmes,
Griffin, Bellavia, & Rose, 2001). Therefore, feelings of infe-
riority were expected to be greater for UL than equal love, but
the more interdependent types were expected to engender
greater feelings of inferiority (vs. the less interdependent
types) due to the greater sense of rejection and lack of fulfill-
ment inherent in them.
Method
Participants.Respondents were 239 high school students
(104 males, 135 females) and 165 university students (54
males, 111 females), aged 13 to 63 years (M = 20.2, SD =
6.36). University students were given extra credit in a psy-
chology course for their participation.1
Questionnaire.
Some items for the questionnaire were
selected from existing scales to represent the following
domains: commitment, idealization of the love object,
obsessive thoughts for the love object, ambivalent feelings
for the love object (e.g., inferiority, rejection), perceived
similarity of the love object, and presumed knowledge of
the love object.2
Procedures. Questionnaires provided a description of one of
the six types of love relationships (the five types of UL and
equal love) and were randomly distributed to respondents.
Respondents were asked whether they were currently experi-
encing that type of love relationship. If yes, they completed
the questionnaire referring to that relationship. If not, they
were asked whether they had experienced that type of love
relationship within the past 2 years. If yes, they were
instructed to choose the most intense example of that type of
relationship that had occurred in the past 2 years and com-
plete the questionnaire referring to that relationship. If not,
they were instructed to contact the researcher, who gave
them another questionnaire with a different type of love rela-
tionship. This procedure was continued until the respondent
could complete a questionnaire.
Results
The following frequencies were obtained for the types of
love relationships: crush on a star (n = 36, 8.9%), nearby (n
= 83, 20.5%), pursuing (n = 39, 9.6%), longing for someone
from a past relationship (n = 56, 13.8%), unequal love (n =
85, 21%), and equal love (n = 105, 25.9%).
Factor analysis. Numerous principal components factor anal-
yses were conducted on all items measuring qualities that
may be distinct to UL relationships. Factor analyses were
conducted using all respondents, only respondents in longing
for a past lover or in equal and unequal love relationships,
and only those in equal and unequal love relationships. In
addition, each of these principal components factor analyses
was conducted imposing various constraints on the number
of factors extracted. Finally, principal components factor
analyses were conducted with both orthogonal (varimax) and
oblique (oblimin) rotations. The factor structure was rela-
tively stable across these different analyses.3 Four items
loaded on several different factors in different analyses or
they formed idiosyncratic factors; these items were elimi-
nated from additional analyses.
The first factor, Fulfillment ( = .91), was composed of 13
items measuring relationship satisfaction (e.g., For me,
______ is the perfect romantic partner; I believe a relation-
ship with ______ is capable of satisfying me overall, for-
ever). The second factor, Ambivalence ( = .83), contained
eight items related to both the positive and negative qualities
of love (e.g., Sometimes I feel my life would be much better
if I didn't love ______; but other times ______ makes me
happy; concerning my relationship with ______, I some-
times feel that I can't live with ______ and I can't live with-
out ______). The third factor, Obsession ( = .86), contained
six items intended to measure preoccupation with the love
object (e.g., I find it hard to concentrate on my work because
I can't get ______ off my mind; I find myself thinking about
______ all the time). The fourth factor, Homogamy ( = .85),
contained seven items intended to measure perceived simi-
larity between the love object and the respondent (e.g.,
______ and I are very much alike in many ways; I believe
that ______ and I could talk about the same things for hours
on end). The fifth factor, Knowledge ( = .88), contained
three items intended to measure perceived knowledge of the
love object (e.g., I am aware of ______'s shortcomings and
faults; I am aware of what kind of person ______ is for I
know all about his/her past). The final factor, Inferiority ( =
.67), contained four items intended to measure feelings of
inferiority and rejection (e.g., I am afraid ______ will reject
me in the future; sometimes my relationship with ______
makes me feel inferior).
Table 3 shows the correlations between factors. The scales
measuring Fulfillment, Obsession, Homogamy, and
Knowledge were moderately intercorrelated (average r =
.46). Inferiority and Ambivalence were correlated, but rela-
tively independent of the other scales.
Analyses. To provide comparisons with equal love, z scores
were computed for each scale using the mean and standard
deviation of the equal love group on that scale. A two-way
MANOVA (Type of relationship × Gender) based on all stan-
dardized scale scores revealed a significant multivariate

For the Type of relationship main effect, Table 4 reports
the results of the analyses on the significant univariate main
effects (all variables except Obsession). The planned contrast
Bringle et al. 7
of equal love to all types of UL showed a significant differ-
ence for all measures except Obsession. UL relationships, as
a group, demonstrated lower Fulfillment, Homogamy, and
Knowledge, but greater Ambivalence and Inferiority. The lin-
ear and quadratic trends were calculated across the types of
UL relationships. There were dominant linear trends for
Fulfillment, Ambivalence, and Knowledge. In addition, there
was a significant quadratic trend for Inferiority. Furthermore,
Duncan's multiple range tests indicated that, forAmbivalence,
crush on a star, loving someone nearby, and equal love were
associated with significantly less Ambivalence than the
remaining relationships.
Table 5 reports the means for the two significant univari-
ate interactions. In general, male and females responses for
Fulfillment were the same except that Duncan multiple range
tests revealed that males scored significantly lower than
females on Fulfillment when pursuing, and males scored sig-
nificantly lower on Fulfillment than females when in equal
love relationships. For Inferiority, females scored signifi-
cantly higher than males when pursuing.
Discussion
Study 1b was designed to detect the presence of several
qualities (perceived similarity, perceived knowledge, and
obsessiveness) that theorists (e.g., Aron et al., 1998; Noller,
1996; Tennov, 1979) have identified as being distinctive of
UL. Some of the items measuring these qualities were
revised so that they would apply to the UL relationships.
These revisions, if anything, would have allowed respon-
dents more latitude to endorse the item when considering
UL relationships.
The results failed to demonstrate that the presence of per-
ceived homogamy and perceived knowledge were distinctive
of any type of UL, relative to equal love. Contrary to the
predictions associated with limerence (Tennov, 1979),
knowledge and obsessiveness were positively, not negatively

correlated and both were positively correlated with fulfill-
ment. In addition, level of obsessiveness was similar in UL
relationships and equal love relationships. Thus, the findings
for perceived similarity, perceived knowledge, and obses-
siveness were not consistent with the presumption that limer-
ence is a dominant characteristic of UL, even when a test of
this hypothesis was biased toward confirmation. The results
concerning inferiority conceptually replicated those showing
that UL relationships were associated with more negative
outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety, poorer well-being) than
equal love relationships (Smith & Hokland, 1988).
Study 2
The experience of love has been described in theories as sub-
suming a variety of attributes. Love involves passion, inti-
macy, and commitment (Sternberg, 1986); attachment,
caregiving, and sexuality (Shaver et al., 1996; Shaver &
Hazan, 1988; Shaver & Mikulincer, 2006); passionate and
companionate (Berscheid & Walster, 1978); caring and need-
ing (Kelley et al., 1983); eros, ludus, and storge (Lee, 1973,
1988); and self-enhancement (Aron & Aron, 1986, 1996).
The prototype of UL occurs when the imbalance is such that
it generates longing, obsession (Tennov, 1979), and "empti-
ness, anxiety or despair" (Hatfield, 1988, p. 193), qualities
not typically associated with romantic love. As most roman-
tic relationships fall short of the ideal (e.g., Sprecher et al.,
1998), actual romantic love, including UL, may incorporate
these and other negative emotions, even though Baumeister
et al. (1993) found that would-be lovers reported more posi-
tive than negative emotions.
The most dominant dimension in C. Hendrick and
Hendrick's (1989) analysis of romantic love was passion
(Grote & Frieze, 1994). The literature, however, provides
contradictory bases for predicting whether UL contains
greater, equal, or less passion than equal love. Sternberg's
(1986) theory differentiates equal, consummate love (pas-
sion, commitment, and intimacy) from infatuation (passion
without commitment and intimacy), suggesting that passion
should be high for both types of love.
In contrast, Aron and Aron's (1986, 1996) self-expansion
theory of love suggests that relationship development toward
consummate love should show growth of all positive out-
comes, such as interdependence, friendship, commitment,
and passion. This perspective leads to the expectation that
passion increases as the level of interdependence in this type
of love relationship increases. Alternatively, limerence
(Tennov, 1979) suggests that UL would have a higher level
of passion than commensurate love.
While Study 1a measured the intensity of emotional reac-
tions in general and Study 1b measured limerent qualities of
love, Study 2 was designed to differentiate the components
of consummate and UL, determine how UL might differ
from equal love on these dimensions, and determine how
these emotions (e.g., passion, intimacy, commitment) varied
for different types of UL relationships. In addition, Study 2
directly tested the assumption that types of UL can be orga-
nized by levels of presumed interdependence. Specifically,
the level of commitment (a dimension of love and interde-
pendence; Rusbult, 1983; Sternberg, 1986) was expected to
be lower for less interdependent types of UL (i.e., crush on
someone who is unavailable, crush on someone nearby with-
out initiating a romantic relationship) and highest for unequal
love. In addition, all types of UL were expected to show
lower levels of commitment than equal love.
Finally, discriminate validity of these dimensions was
sought by comparing both types of love relationships with a
nonlove relationship (friendship). Davis and Todd (1982)
demonstrated that love and friendships have unique character-
istics (see also Grote & Frieze, 1994); love was found to have
stronger passion, fascination, and sexual desire. However,
both relationships provide important social support.
Method
Participants. Respondents were 44 high school students (23
males, 21 females) and 405 university students (135 males,
270 females), aged 16 to 48 years (M = 22.5, SD = 6.3). Uni-
versity students were given extra credit in a psychology
course for their participation.
Questionnaire. C. Hendrick and Hendrick (1989) provided a
synthesis of the various approaches to measuring love and
identify the underlying dimensions inherent in these mea-
sures. Their factor structure for scale scores served as a pre-
liminary basis for sampling items from existing scales. Items
for the questionnaire were selected from existing scales to
represent the following four factors identified in C. Hendrick
and Hendrick's (1989) study: (a) passionate love, intimacy,
and commitment; (b) absence of conflict; (c) anxiety, depen-
dency, and jealousy; and (d) friendship. To represent the self-
enhancement theory (Aron & Aron, 1986, 1996), some items
were also identified and sampled.4
The questionnaire also contained Rusbult's (1983) mea-
sure of commitment. Four-item subscales measuring satis-
faction,alternatives,andinvestmentswereused.Commitment
was computed as the following linear combination of rela-
tionship satisfaction (RSAT), investments (INV), and alter-
natives (ALT): COMM = RSAT + INV - ALT.
Procedures. Respondents were presented with descriptions of
the types of love relationships from less interdependent to
highly interdependent. The next-to-last choice described an
equal love relationship and the last choice gave the following
description of a friendship: You are in a relationship in which
your feelings for the person you have in mind could best be
described as a genuine, caring friendship. Respondents were
instructed to choose the first description that described a cur-
rent relationship and complete the questionnaire referring to
that relationship. The descriptions were ordered by
Bringle et al. 9
interdependence to obtain sufficient numbers of persons
choosing the less interdependent types of love relationships,
assuming that everyone would have a current friendship.
Results
In spite of the instructions that respondents were to choose
the first type of relationship that described a current relation-
ship, crush on a star had a low frequency of being chosen (n =
5, 1%). The other types produced more proportionate selec-
tions: nearby (n = 61, 12%), pursuing (n = 36, 7.1%), longing
for someone from a past relationship (n = 77, 15.2%),
unequal love (n = 68, 13.4%), equal love (n = 174, 34.3%),
and friendship (n = 86, 16.9%).
Factor analyses. Numerous principal components factor anal-
yses were conducted on all items except Rusbult's scales.
Rusbult's measure was retained separately because it consti-
tuted a more direct examination of the hypothesis that the
five types of UL were ordered according to the level of inter-
dependence. Factor analyses were conducted using all
respondents. However, the entire sample included some per-
sons who completed the questionnaire while referring to a
friendship. Having respondents complete the "love" scale
while referring to a friendship is useful for purposes of com-
parison across types of relationships, but is not entirely
appropriate for examining the factor structure of a love scale.
Therefore, the principal components factor analyses were
also conducted excluding respondents in the friendship con-
dition. In addition, respondents in C. Hendrick and Hen-
drick's research were undergraduates who were asked to
refer to their current dating partner or their last dating part-
ner. Because our sample also included respondents who were
referring to other types of love relationships, the factor anal-
yses were also conducted for only those respondents who
completed the questionnaire for unequal and equal love rela-
tionships. In addition, each of these principal components
factor analyses was conducted imposing various constraints
on the number of factors extracted. Finally, principal compo-
nents factor analyses were conducted with both orthogonal
(varimax) and oblique (oblimin) rotations.
There were some differences in the factor structure across
analyses. On some analyses, the first factor split into two fac-
tors; however, the correlation between these two subscales
was very high (r > .75). Five items loaded on several differ-
ent factors, depending on the subsample selected and the
rotation procedure employed; these 5 items were eliminated
from additional analyses. The remaining 50 items demon-
strated remarkable consistency in factor structure across
analyses.
The factors identified from the analysis of items partially
corroborated C. Hendrick and Hendrick's factor structure
when they analyzed scale scores. There was a dominant fac-
tor (based on all love relationships and varimax rotation, per-
centage variance = 33.7) that was labeled Passion ( = .97)
and corresponded to C. Hendrick and Hendrick's first factor
(e.g., I melt when I look deeply into ______'s eyes; I would
rather be with ______ than anyone else). The second factor
consisted of eight items and was labeled Sacrifice ( = .90,
for example, If I were going through a difficult time, I would
put away my own concerns to help ______ out; I would do
almost anything for ______). This factor does not correspond
to any of C. Hendrick and Hendrick's factors (Agape loaded
on their first factor). The third factor extracted contained
seven items dealing with turmoil and tension ( = .83, for
example, Sometimes I feel that loving ______ have changed
me for the worse; There is tension in my relationships with
______). The fourth factor was composed of five items creat-
ing an index of Dependency ( = .83, for example, It would
be hard for me to get along without ______ in my life; I
believe that ______ is almost completely responsible for my
feelings of sadness and happiness). Another factor, Practical,
was composed of three items ( = .50, for example, I con-
sider a relationship with ______ would reflect favorably on
my career; I believe an important factor in choosing a partner
is whether or not he/she would be a good parent). Although
the reliability was low, because the score was based on only
three items, it was included in subsequent analyses.
Rusbult's 12-item measure of commitment (4 items each
for satisfaction, alternatives, and investments) had a coeffi-
cient alpha of .87.
Table 6 reports the correlations between the factor scores,
computed with unit weighting. In general, the scores were
moderately correlated with each other, with the exception of
Turmoil. The average of the absolute values of the correla-
tions of other variables and Turmoil was .12, whereas the
average of the absolute values of the correlations of the other
variables with each other was .55.

Analyses. To provide a comparison with equal love, z scores
were created for each scale extracted by the factor analysis
using the mean and standard deviation of the equal love
group. Because of the small size of the group describing a
crush on a star, this group was deleted from all inferential
analyses.
The MANOVA based on all scales found a significant
multivariate main effect for Type of relationship, F(30, 1726)
= 21.91, p < .01, Wilks's lambda = .28. Three planned com-
parisons were computed for each significant univariate type
of relationship main effect. First, the average of all types of
love relationships was compared with friendship. Second,
equal love was compared with friendship. Third, the average
of all types of UL relationships was compared with equal
love. In all cases, except Turmoil and Sacrifice (see Table 7),
each contrast was significant. The lack of significance for the
first contrast on Sacrifice indicates that love, in general, and
friendships both involve similar amounts of sacrifice,
although the types of love differed. The lack of significance
for the second contrast on Turmoil indicates that the level of
Turmoil was similar in friendships and equal love relation-
ships, but it was significantly lower than that in UL
relationships.
To evaluate the rationale for ordering types of UL on a
continuum of interdependence, the linear trend was calcu-
lated for the types of UL relationships (equal love was not
included in these analyses; when it was included, the linear
trends were more pronounced). The linear trend was signifi-
cant for each of the dependent variables except Practical (see
Table 4).
Discussion
The primary purpose of Study 2 was to identify similarities
and differences between types of love relationships and
friendships on dimensions of love. UL was found to be quite
distinct from equal love in terms of the intensity of each
component of love. On each of the positive dimensions (pas-
sion, sacrifice, dependency, commitment, and practical love),
UL relationships as a group reported less intense feelings and
beliefs, which corroborates and expands on the findings of
Study 1a. In addition, the most interdependent type of UL
(unequal love) showed significantly more passion, sacrifice,
dependency, and commitment than did the least interdepen-
dent type (loving someone who is nearby), again supporting
the conceptual ordering of UL relationships on the presumed
dimension of interdependency.
If infatuation is a characteristic of the less interdependent
forms of UL (e.g., S. S. Hendrick & Hendrick, 1992), then
passion should have been high for all types of UL (Sternberg,
1986). However, a significant linear component was found
across the four types of UL, such that persons in the more
interdependent types reported higher levels of passion.
Unbridled passion, then, is not uniformly experienced in all
forms of UL (Regan, 1998). Nor is there evidence that actual
relationships supply "reality constraints" that reduce passion
(Murray et al., 1996; Tesser & Paulus, 1976). This finding is
also consistent with earlier results that failed to support pre-
dictions about limerence (Study 1b).
However, the experience of love is not limited to just pos-
itive feelings. Interestingly, the most significant deviation
from the pattern of correlated factors was for Turmoil, which
suggests that such negative feelings can coexist with various
levels of positive feelings (cf. Berscheid & Walster, 1978).
Furthermore, these negative feelings (turmoil) were more
evident in UL than in either equal love or friendships.
However, turmoil was more evident in more interdependent
than in less interdependent types of UL. Thus, the less inter-
dependent forms of UL provide not only low positive emo-
tional payoffs (e.g., passion) but also fewer emotional costs

(e.g., turmoil) than attempting to start a relationship and
doing so with difficulty.
The propositions that greater interdependence (with its
higher levels of frequency, diversity, interaction, influence,
and behavioral control) exists in the more interdependent
types of UL relationships and leads to greater levels of pas-
sion, dependency, practical love, and commitment were sup-
ported. However, to the extent that the types are viewed as a
progression toward equal romantic love, there were increas-
ing costs (turmoil) as a love relationship became more inter-
dependent (Regan, 1998).
The results also provide evidence of discriminate validity
for these dimensions of love. In comparison with equal love,
individuals who completed the questionnaire for a friendship
scored significantly lower on all dimensions except Turmoil
(Davis & Todd, 1982). In addition, all types of love (equal
and unrequited) were rated significantly higher than friend-
ship on all dimensions except Sacrifice.
General Discussion
With few exceptions (e.g., Aron & Aron, 1991; Aron et al.,
1998; Baumeister et al., 1993; K. K. Dion & Dion, 1975; Hill
et al., 1997), empirical research on romantic love has neither
differentiated UL nor studied it as a separate construct.
Kelley (1983/2002) has noted that there can be no single
theory of love, and different kinds of love warrant different
theories. Sternberg and Weis's (2006) compendium of
research on love does not have UL in the index and authors
generally fail to differentiate UL as a type of love (with the
exception of cursory mention of infatuation, lust, and incom-
plete love). However, Berscheid (2010) contended that con-
fusion around the conceptualization of love and clear
differentiation of love is necessary for enhancing the quality
of research on love. The current research demonstrates the
high prevalence of UL, relative to equal love, and the distinc-
tive nature of UL (e.g., emotional and behavioral manifesta-
tion). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the causes
and consequences of UL warrant separate theoretical and
empirical treatment (Berscheid, 2006, 2010).
Previous attempts to describe and understand the nature
of UL have found placing analyses of love within a com-
parative context useful. Baumeister et al. (1993) chose to
compare the experiences of the enamored with the experi-
ences of the person being pursued. Hill et al. (1997) com-
pared frequencies of UL with mutual love. Aron and Aron
(1991) differentiated three types of UL (secret, jilted, and
hanger on) and compared them within the context of self-
expansion theory, and Aron et al. (1998) analyzed how
strengths of three motives were related to the intensity of UL
for persons with different adult romantic attachment styles.
The current research expanded on these research strategies
by differentiating five types of UL that are assumed to be
conceptually organized in terms of interdependence, and
then measured their prevalence, emotional experiences in
general, emotional experiences common to romantic love,
and experiences assumed to be unique to UL. Several find-
ings support the conceptualization of different types of UL
based on levels of presumed interdependence. Study 1a
showed that the more interdependent types of UL relation-
ships elicited reports of greater intensity and were longer in
duration (Berscheid & Ammazzalorso, 2001). In Study 1b,
less interdependent types of UL were less fulfilling than
more interdependent types of UL and persons involved in
UL love relationships with less interdependence were less
knowledgeable about the partner than those in more interde-
pendent love relationships. Study 2 provided additional sup-
port for the distinction by demonstrating that more
interdependent UL relationships were characterized by more
commitment, dependency, passion, and sacrifice.
This research expanded on Baumeister et al.'s (1993)
research by comparing the reported experiences of those in
different types of UL relationships with the reported experi-
ences of persons in equal love (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2) and
friendship relationships (Study 2). This research expanded
on Hill et al.'s (1997) study by comparing five different types
of UL and equal love on not just frequencies but also intensi-
ties of various emotions (e.g., passion) and beliefs (e.g.,
commitment). These different research strategies begin a
process of triangulation from which a greater understanding
of the nature of UL can proceed.
For example, Baumeister et al. (1993) found that the
enamored reported more positive feelings than did the reject-
ers. Lemieux and Hale (1999) found passion and intimacy to
be stronger than commitment in young dating adults. The
current research found that the enamored in all five types of
UL relationships reported less intense positive feelings than
did those in equal love relationships (Hill et al., 1997, did not
report results on intensity). These results are inconsistent
with the assumption that UL is a euphoric type of love in
which the enamored reaps some of the benefits of being in
love (the feelings of excitement, passion, lust, identification,
distortions of presumed similarity) unencumbered by the
costs and hassles of a real romantic relationship (cf.
Baumeister et al., 1993; Murray et al., 1996; Tesser & Paulus,
1976). These results are also inconsistent with the assump-
tion that the distortion, imagination, and fantasies of UL pro-
vide exaggerated benefits (and very high costs such as
suffering) that approximate or exceed those reported in con-
summate love relationships (Murray et al., 1996; Tennov,
1979). If these states do exist in UL, then the retrospective
accounts suggest that they are more ephemeral than or not as
salient as equal love relationships. Real love may not be a
state of unqualified bliss; however, this research shows that
UL is inferior to equal love on positive qualities and is not a
good approximation of it.
Baumeister et al. (1993) also found that the enamored
reported less intense negative feelings than did rejecters in
UL. The current research found that the enamored in UL
relationships generally experienced more intense negative
12 SAGE Open
feelings than did those in equal love relationships. Thus,
these results are inconsistent with speculation that UL avoids
certain costs that are embedded in equal love relationships
(e.g., Baumeister & Wotman, 1992). However, these results
are consistent with the portrayals that those in UL relation-
ships suffer from turmoil, suffering, ambivalence, misery,
and pain (Smith & Hokland, 1988).
UL, then, is not a fulfilling emotional state, circumstance,
or relationship that provides the benefits of love at low costs
to the enamored. At best, it provides small rewards at some
costs. Furthermore, as the type becomes more interdepen-
dent and rewards increase, so do the costs until equal love
occurs or the relationship is terminated (Arriaga, 2001;
Regan, 1998). This picture of UL highlights its paradoxical
nature. From the point of view of exchange theory, relation-
ships with this status (low fulfillment, moderate costs) should
be infrequent, unstable, and ephemeral. Indeed, UL relation-
ships were found to be of somewhat shorter duration. Yet,
UL relationships persisted and occurred with a much higher
cumulative frequency than consummate love. Why? There
are at least three ways to understand why UL is so prevalent
and is tolerated by many persons: (a) imperfect practice, (b)
errors in the education of attention (Gibson, 1966), and (c)
incentive.
The research started with the question, "Is UL a type of
love?" In many ways, UL did not measure up to consummate
love. However, this research demonstrates that UL does pro-
vide some of the experiences of love that are not realized in
friendships. Aron et al. (1998) found that the intensity of UL
was related to the desire to be in love. Thus, one of the
motives for pursuing romantic relationships and allowing UL
relationships to persist is that they provide the person with
"practice at being in love." The one characteristic on which
UL was indistinguishable from equal love was obsessive-
ness. UL does provide the enamored with the opportunity to
think about a relationship with the love object and what the
person would, for example, do and what they would talk
about. The costs for this cognitive practice and preparation
are comparatively high, particularly when one acts on these
emotions (Baumeister et al., 1993); but emotional returns
from an UL relationship may be better than no romantic rela-
tionship (Aron et al., 1998).
The matching hypothesis predicts that phenotypically
similar persons are more likely to bond (Berscheid & Reis,
1998). This pattern of positive assortative mating is found to
generalize to various types of relationships (friendships, dat-
ing, marriages), is found for a wide range of characteristics
(e.g., physical, demographic, social-psychological), and is
consistent with numerous theoretical perspectives (e.g.,
Buss, 1994; Price & Vandenberg, 1980). Social psycholo-
gists have frequently assumed that the matching hypothesis
is caused by a preference for similarity because similarity is
rewarding (e.g., Berscheid & Reis, 1998). Thus, individuals
seek out similar others because they prefer similar others.
The matching hypothesis rests on the presumption that
individuals develop a means for accurately evaluating the
desirability of self and others and selecting another who
matches (e.g., Berscheid & Reis, 1998). Thus, the evaluation
of attributes and matching on those attributes are probably
acquired skills, and errors would be made in learning these
skills (Barelds & Barelds-Dijkstra, 2007; Epstude & Forster,
2011). Some instances of UL may then be evidence of those
errors. If so, then UL may occur before persons develop a
good sense of self-knowledge, self-appraisal, and the "edu-
cation of attention" (Gibson, 1966) that is necessary to eval-
uate others (Neff & Karney, 2006).5
Lykken and Tellegen (1993) presented provocative data to
support the position that similarity does no more than elimi-
nate 50% of the pool of potential mates. Within the remain-
ing 50% "mate-worthy" group, bonding is, according to
them, unpredictable, adventitious, and dependent on idiosyn-
cratic factors that foster reciprocation. This suggests that
lust, infatuation, and crushes (Shaver et al., 1996) are gener-
alized responses that can be easily evoked by a sizable por-
tion of potential romantic partners. Consistent with this, the
type of UL with the highest prevalence was having romantic
feelings for someone nearby (Hill et al., 1997). This is con-
sistent with Lykken and Tellegen's contention that adoles-
cence may be a critical period predisposed toward infatuation,
which produces a wide array of internal responses (sexual
fantasies, behavioral intentions) and external responses
(glances, conversations, propositions, proposals). Lust, then,
can be viewed as a fundamental drive with unique biological
components (Fisher, 2006).
As previously mentioned, the results describe UL as a
relationship providing low rewards at relatively high costs.
Thus, the frequency and persistence of UL may be better
understood in terms of its long-term promise for outcomes
rather than in terms of immediate payoffs (e.g.,Aron &Aron,
1996). As the song warns, "you're nobody 'til somebody
loves you," that message represents a powerful motivator if
persons believe that they are fundamentally deficient without
love and that they can only become whole through love.
Thus, the plight of enamored persons, particularly in the
more interdependent types of UL, is partially understood not
in terms of the immediate net payoffs (e.g., positive and neg-
ative feelings, personal and interpersonal fulfillment) in their
relationships but in terms of the incentive value of potential
payoffs as love increases in a relationship (Sprecher, 1999).
Indeed, Aron et al. (1998) demonstrated that the perceived
desirability or value of the potential romantic relationship,
the perceived probability of having a romantic relationship,
and desirability of the state or benefits to the self of the
potential relationship were each independently important for
understanding the motivation to enter and maintain a UL
relationship. For the enamored, pursuing the relationship is a
high-stakes gamble in which the potential for high payoffs
justifies the use of unscrupulous tactics along with the risks
of failure, embarrassment, and lowered self-esteem
(Baumeister et al., 1993).

Notes
1. The same participants from Study 1a with 100 additional high
school students (who did not complete the measures from
Study 1a) completed several other measures of romantic rela-
tionships at a separate time. Because of the addition of new
participants and the change in focus of the research questions
examined in these later questionnaires, these results are pre-
sented as part of a related study.
2. The following items were utilized in the questionnaire and
subsequent factor analyses: Hatfield and Sprecher's (1986)
Passionate Love Scale (12, 15, 21R), Sternberg's Triangular
Theory of Love Scale (5R, 7 11R, 12R, 45R), Rusbult's
(1983) Commitment Scale, Davis and Latty-Mann's (1987)
Relationship Rating Scale (18R, 19R, 20R, 33R, 54R, 55R),
Aron, Dutton, Aron, and Allen's (1989) measure of love as
self-enhancement (1R, 5R), and C. Hendrick and Hendrick's
(1986) Love Attitudes Scale (7R, 17R, 19R, 23R, 28R, 29R,
47). The "R" behind an item number indicates that the item
was revised. This also applies to Study 2. Items were revised
so that they were in the same format and so that they could
reasonably apply to all types of love relationships as well as
equal love relationships. For example, Sternberg's item 45 was
changed from "I fantasize about my partner" to "I frequently
fantasize about taking part in romantic activities with _____."
In addition, 13 original items were included in the question-
naire to provide additional measures of each domain. All sur-
vey items are available from the first author.
3. To conserve space, the items that loaded on each factor, in this
study or in Study 2, are not presented but can be obtained from
the first author.
4. The following items were sampled and submitted to fac-
tor analyses: Hatfield and Sprecher's (1986) Passionate
Love Scale (2R, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 23R,
25R, 26R, 28, 30), Hatfield, Brinton, and Cornelius's (1989)
Juvenile Love Scale (12), Davis and Latty-Mann's (1987)
Relationship Rating Scale (3R, 19R, 33R, 49R, 50R, 53R,
54R), Rubin's (1970) Love Scale (4, 6, 8, 13R), Sternberg's
Triangular Theory of Love Scale (as cited in C. Hendrick &
Hendrick, 1989; 45R), Aron et al.'s (1989) measure of love
as self-enhancement (5R, 23, I-R, Q-R), and C. Hendrick and
Hendrick's (1986) Love Attitudes Scale (7R, 11R, 12R, 19R,
23R, 24R, 28, 29R, 30R, 34R, 42R, 43R, 47R). As in Study
1a, items were revised so that they could reasonably apply to
all types of unrequited love relationships as well as equal love
relationships. Four original items were included to measure
dependency, anxiety, and jealousy. All survey items are avail-
able from the first author.
5. An alternative explanation for the failure of age-dependent
effects to appear more prominently is that the matching
hypothesis is either incorrect or of limited importance in the
mate selection criteria (see Price & Vandenberg, 1980) or the
criteria for appraising the desirability of the self and others
changes with age.
