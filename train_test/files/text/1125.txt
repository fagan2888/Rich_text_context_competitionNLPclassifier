index gain, fast food, and physical activity: effects of shared
environments over time. Obesity. 2006;14:701­709.
Objective: The magnitude of environmental vs. genetic ef-
fects on BMI, diet, and physical activity (PA) is widely
debated. We followed a sibling cohort (where individuals
shared households in childhood and adolescence) to young
adulthood (when some continued sharing households and
others lived apart) to examine the role of discordant envi-
ronments in adult twins' divergent trends in BMI and health
behaviors and to quantify the variation in BMI and behavior
among all siblings that is attributable to environmental and
additive genetic effects.
Research Methods and Procedures: In the National Lon-
gitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, siblings sharing
households for 10 years as adolescents (mean age 
16.5  1.7 years; N  5524) were followed into adulthood
(mean  22.4  1.8 years; N  4368), self-reporting PA,
sedentary behavior, and dietary characteristics. Adult BMI
and adolescent z scores were derived from measured height
and weight.
Results: Compared with those living together, twins living
apart exhibited greater discordance in change in BMI, PA,
and fast food intake from adolescence to adulthood. Ado-
lescent household environments accounted for 8% to 10%
of variation in adolescent fast food intake and sedentary
behaviors and 50% of variation in adolescent overweight.
Adolescent household effects on PA were substantially
greater in young adulthood (accounting for 50% of varia-
tion) vs. adolescence. Young adult fast food intake was
significantly affected by young adult household environ-
ment, accounting for 12% of variation.
Discussion: These findings highlight important environ-
mental influences on BMI, PA, and fast food intake during
the transition to adulthood. Household and physical envi-
ronments play an important role in establishing long-term
behavior patterns.

Introduction
The transition from childhood to adulthood is a critical
stage, marked by striking physical activity (PA)1 declines
(1) and weight gain (2). Household and neighborhood en-
vironments have substantial effects on body weight (e.g.,
3,4), related health behaviors [e.g., PA (5,6), and fast food
intake (7)] and are important modifiable risk factors for
obesity prevention/reduction strategies.
Quantifying genetic and environmental influences on
health outcomes is challenging. Genetic factors affect phys-
iological processes related to PA (8) and weight (9,10), but
epidemiological studies of environment effects typically do
not account for genetic predisposition. The extent to which
genes contribute to body size, exercise, and/or food prefer-
ences is widely debated. For example, an estimated 50% to
90% of variability in adiposity is attributable to genetics
(11). Population-wide genetic differences may substantially
limit the ability to detect environmental effects on health
(particularly modest effects) using cohort studies of non-
related individuals.

Many study designs that are used to address genetic
variation, including studies of twins separated at birth and
reared apart (e.g., 12), do not allow separation of effects of
different environment exposures (e.g., separation of child-
hood influences from later environmental effects). Family/
household environments during childhood may influence
long-term health behaviors and may confound or bias esti-
mates of environment-health associations. These method-
ological concerns continue to fuel the widespread debate
over the true magnitude of environmental effects on obesity
and related health behaviors.
Pedigree studies provide a unique opportunity to address
genetic variation in a population and the influence of un-
measured or poorly measured confounding encountered in
observational cohort studies. The transition from adoles-
cence to adulthood, when a substantial number of individ-
uals relocate to new environments, allows assessment of
relative contributions of environmental and genetic influ-
ences in shared vs. non-shared environments. Following
individuals who are genetically similar and share childhood
household and neighborhood environments, we can evalu-
ate variation in health behaviors and subsequent behavior
changes as individuals move into different environments.
By concurrently assessing individuals with varying degrees
of genetic relatedness (in shared households as children and
adolescents), we can account for multiple shared environ-
mental and genetic sources of variation, providing the op-
portunity to better tease apart causal effects on health using
methods not possible with traditional cohort studies.
Our analyses use sibling data from the National Longi-
tudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). As ado-
lescents, participants shared household and neighborhood
environments plus various other unmeasured genetic and
familial factors. As young adults, some continued to share
households, whereas others moved to new environments.
Therefore, this design provides a natural experiment that
can be used to supplement findings from cohort studies
quantifying environmental effects on health trends during
this critical stage of life. The specific aims of this paper
were to examine the correlations of various health measures
in monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins
continuing to live together as young adults, vs. those who
live apart, and to quantify additive genetic and household
effects on BMI and related health behaviors in a large
sample of siblings and non-siblings sharing family and
household environments.
Research Methods and Procedures
Add Health
Add Health is a nationally representative, longitudinal
survey of youths, grades 7 to 12. Survey procedures de-
scribed elsewhere (13) were approved by the Institutional
Review Board, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Wave I (1994 to 1995) included 20,745 adolescents and
their parents. Wave II (1996, n  14,438) included Wave I
adolescents who had not graduated from high school, in-
cluding drop-outs. Wave III (2001 to 2002, n  15,197)
included all located Wave I respondents, now 18 to 27 years
old (regardless of Wave II participation).
Family Subsample
Add Health oversampled subgroups, including a respon-
dent subsample matched with related and non-related ado-
lescents sharing a Wave I household. Up to five adolescents
per household were surveyed (mean, 2.1  0.4 individuals/
household), including twins, full siblings, one-half siblings,
cousins, and non-related adolescents (Figure 1). Cousins
were not assessed by degree of relatedness. The sample
included 5524 Wave I respondents living in 2639 house-
holds. We limited our sample to 4782 adolescents (in 2302
households) living together for 10 years at Wave I, thus
sharing household/physical environments during childhood
and adolescence. In Wave III, 4588 participants were sur-
veyed as young adults; 913 individuals (in 449 households)
continued living with another survey respondent. We then
excluded participants who were severely disabled (n 
100), pregnant (Wave II, n  75; III, n  94), or missing
primary exposure variables (BMI, Wave II, n  450; III,
n  613; PA, Wave II, n  437; III, n  532; sedentary
behaviors, Wave II, n  436; III, n  567; fast food, Wave
II: n  440; III, n  515).
Non-twin sibships were classified by self-report. Twin
zygosity was determined by matching 12 molecular ge-
netic markers at Waves I or III (n  808) (14) or by full
agreement of self-report measures, including confusabil-
ity of appearance (n  683) (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/
projects/addhealth/). Zygosity was not determined for 83

participants who were excluded. Buccal cells were collected
for DNA analysis by rubbing cheeks/gums with a sterile
cytology brush. DNA extraction, conducted at the Univer-
sity of Arizona using established methods (15­17), yielded,
on average, 58  1 g DNA/sample. DNA was stored at
4 °C and transported for genotyping to the Institute of
Behavioral Genetics, University of Colorado (Boulder,
CO). Questionable results were repeated to limit potential
genotyping errors.
BMI
BMI (kilograms per meter squared) was calculated from
measured height and weight, assessed at Waves II and III
using standardized procedures. Self-reported height and
weight were substituted for those refusing measurement
and/or weighing more than the scale capacity (Wave II, n 
54; III, n  155) (1). Wave II BMI z scores were based on
National Center for Health Statistics/Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention reference data (18). Adolescent
overweight was defined as BMI  95th percentile (19)
[individuals aged 20 years (n  14) were considered 20
years of age]. In adulthood (Wave III), obesity was classi-
fied as BMI  30 (20).
Daily Activities
Daily PA (e.g., housework, hobbies, active play, sports,
exercise) was assessed using standard 7-day recall question-
naire methods relevant for epidemiological research (21).
Described in detail elsewhere (5,22), questions were similar
to those used and validated in other large-scale studies
(21,23,24) and allowed calculation of activity frequency
(bouts per week) by metabolic equivalent level. Moderate-
vigorous (MV) PA was 5 to 8 metabolic equivalents (25).
Adolescents reported sedentary behaviors (hours per week
watching TV/videos and/or playing video/computer games).
Wave III included questions appropriate for young adults
(e.g., walking for exercise, weight-lifting). As in previous
Add Health literature (2), a scaled MVPA sum was used,
corresponding to the number of activities reported in Waves
I and II to account for potential reporting bias and artificial
increase in reported activities due to inclusion of additional
questionnaire items. MVPA frequency was summed to de-
termine whether participants met national PA recommenda-
tions (5 bouts/wk) (26).
Dietary habits (e.g., times/wk eating at a fast food res-
taurant) were measured using a 7-day recall instrument.
Changes in activity and diet were assessed as the difference
between values reported at Waves II and III.
Analyses
Aim 1. Twin pair correlations were used to assess whether
discordant environments were associated with differential
changes in BMI and health behaviors. Twin correlations
were determined by Pearson correlation coefficients, strat-
ified by zygosity (STATA version 8.2, 2004; STATA Cor-
poration, College Station, TX). In Aim 1, only MZ and
same-sex DZ twins were assessed. Cross-sectional (Waves
II and III) and longitudinal (Waves II to III) analyses were
conducted. Analyses were stratified by household residence
in adulthood (living together/apart in Wave III).
The expectation was that traits determined predominantly
by genetic vs. environmental factors would yield MZ pair
correlations two times that of DZ pair correlations; how-
ever, for traits more environmentally determined, twin cor-
relations would be higher among those in shared (vs. non-
shared) households, regardless of zygosity.
The difference between correlation coefficients in pairs
living together vs. apart, was tested using Fisher's z score
transformation, computing a z score for each coefficient. z
Score differences were divided by the standard error of
difference between the correlations (Equation 1).

To determine statistical significance of the difference in
correlations, the resulting z value was compared with a
value of 1.96 (i.e.,   0.05) (27).
Aim 2. Using a variance component approach, SOLAR
software (28) was used to estimate the proportion of ob-
served variation in a given health outcome attributable to
additive genetic effects, household/physical environment,
and other unidentified sources (i.e., residual effects). Heri-
tability is the ratio of additive genetic variance (2
g
) to total
phenotypic variance (2

) (Equation 2).

Individual phenotype (y) was modeled as a linear function
accounting for genetic (g), household (c), and environmen-
tal (e) effects and potentially important covariates (age, sex)

matrix of kinship coefficients (); for environmental vari-
ance it is an identity matrix (I) (diagonal elements are ones,
remaining elements are zero), and for household variance it
is a household matrix (C), which permits unique environ-
ments for each household. Household environment effects
were estimated using shared or non-shared residence to
approximate the household.
We employed a bivariate variance component approach
to assess the joint effect of genes, households, and environ-
ment on the covariation of BMI and related behaviors. In
multivariate models, phenotype covariance was decom-
posed into genetic, household, and environmental compo-
nents (Equation 5),

Given the expected mean and covariance matrix, a mul-
tivariate normal density function was used to estimate the
likelihood of household members' phenotypes. Likelihoods
were summed for all individuals. For variables with kurtotic
distributions, we employed the multivariate Student's t dis-
tribution because simulation studies have shown that it
recovers the correct Type I error, even in cases of strong
kurtosis (29).
Results
Mean age was 16.5  1.7 years in Wave II and 22.4 
1.8 years in Wave III. At baseline, 50.3% of the sample was
female. Prevalence of overweight/obesity increased from
adolescence to adulthood; MVPA and breakfast frequency
declined (Table 1). There was little change in sedentary
behavior and fast food intake.
Aim 1: Twin Correlations
Wave II Cross-Sectional Findings. Compared with Wave
II same-sex DZ twins, twin pair correlations were greater
among MZ twins for BMI z score (MZ and DZ, 0.74 and
0.44, respectively), total weekly MVPA (0.56 and 0.41),
weekly fast food intake (0.52 and 0.39), and weekly break-
fast consumption (0.43 and 0.33). Correlations for total
weekly hours of sedentary behavior followed opposite
trends (0.32 and 0.40).
Waves II to III Longitudinal Findings. Table 2 shows
correlations in health measures by residence (living together
or apart). Twins living apart had greater discordant longi-
tudinal changes in BMI, MVPA, sedentary behavior (DZ
twins only), fast food consumption, and breakfast consump-
tion (MZ twins only). However, differences in correlations
were statistically significant only for BMI gain (MZ twins)
and MVPA change (DZ twins). Conversely, MZ twins
living apart were significantly more highly correlated in
sedentary behavior change.
Wave III Cross-Sectional Findings. MZ twins living apart
had significantly less similarity in BMI at Wave III than MZ
twins living together (Table 3). DZ twins living apart were
less similar in fast food intake at Wave III than DZ twins
living together. MZ twins living apart were more highly
correlated in sedentary behavior compared with those living
together, and DZ twins living apart were more similar in
achieving 5 bouts MVPA per week.

households influenced BMI and related health behaviors in

adolescence and young adulthood (Table 4). The proportion
of variance attributable to genes ranged from 0.30 to 0.40 on
adolescent health measures, with the exception of 5
weekly bouts MVPA (0.59), and was significant for all
measures. Household effects were significant for all but
MVPA, ranging from 0.08 to 0.12 for dietary and sedentary
behaviors and 0.51 for overweight (95th percentile BMI).
Approximately one-half of the variation in diet and seden-
tary behavior was not accounted for.
The magnitude of total genetic and adolescent household
effects on young adult obesity (BMI  30 kg/m2) was
similar to that observed in adolescence, 0.83 (Table 4).
Adolescent household effects on MVPA, however, were
substantially greater in young adulthood (0.50). Household
effects on diet and sedentary behavior ranged from 0.03 to
0.06, and genetic effects ranged from 0.24 to 0.28. Residual
variation in adult estimates was similar in magnitude to that
during adolescence.
We observed few significant joint influences of genes,
households, or residual effects on BMI and other character-
istics (not shown). The additive genetic correlations be-
tween traits were statistically significant (p  0.05) for
Wave II BMI z score and television viewing (0.10), Wave II
BMI z score and fast food intake (0.24), and Wave II BMI
z score and breakfast consumption (0.20). Additive ge-
netic correlations between traits were also significant for
Wave III BMI and breakfast consumption (0.19). In ad-
dition, correlation of residual effects was significant for
Wave III BMI and television viewing (0.21) and Wave III
BMI and total sedentary behavior hours (0.19).

Differential Effects of Environment. Adolescent house-
hold effects were more influential in determining extreme
BMI levels (Figure 2). The proportion of variance attribut-
able to household effects in adolescence was substantially
greater in at-risk-for-overweight (85th percentile) and over-
weight (95th percentile) than in the full BMI z score range.
Young Adult Household Effects. We expected environ-
mental effects in young adulthood to represent the truest
effect of household and physical environments, indepen-
dently of other confounding characteristics of the family,
parental attributes, and childhood up-bringing. Our results,
however, indicated that shared young adult households ac-
counted for little variation in adult BMI and health behav-
iors, although genetic effects were still prominent. Notably,
a significant Wave III household effect was detected for fast
food consumption (0.12  0.02), accounting for 12% of
variation. Variance attributable to additive genetic effects
was significant for BMI  30 (0.85  0.03), 5 bouts
MVPA per week (0.69  0.07), sedentary behavior (0.69 
0.07 h/wk), fast food (times/wk, 0.24  0.05), and breakfast
(0.35  0.04 d/wk).

Impact of Shared Environments on BMI, Nelson et al.

non-shared household environments over time provide an
important opportunity to isolate the effects of these new and
different environmental exposures from the effects of fa-
milial, household, and physical environments during child-
hood and adolescence that persist into young adulthood.
Among MZ and same-sex DZ twin pairs, correlations of
behavior patterns of twins living apart were different from
those of twins who continued sharing household environ-
ments. We hypothesized that such differences reflect the
influence of external characteristics on behavior (e.g., phys-
ical environment and resource accessibility) (30,31). For
example, compared with twins living together, MZ twins
living apart had greater discordance in BMI gain and young
adult BMI, and DZ twins had greater longitudinal change in
MVPA and young adult fast food intake. In contrast to our
hypothesis, however, MZ twins living apart were more
highly correlated in longitudinal and young adult sedentary
behavior, and DZ twins were more highly correlated in
likelihood of achieving 5 bouts of MVPA per week. We
could not determine the extent to which twins' non-shared
household environments differed in adulthood. Future work
should investigate how specific differences in non-shared
environments affect these inconsistencies in divergent
health patterns.
Overall, our findings highlight important genetic and
environmental influences on obesity and related health be-
haviors. Genetic influences are robust during the adolescent
and young adult periods. These results indicate that additive
genetic effects account for approximately one-third to one-
half of variation in overweight/obesity during this time, as
well as 12% to 60% of variation in obesity-related behav-
iors.
The influence of childhood environment is also impor-
tant, persisting into young adulthood, even after households
are no longer shared. Our results show that the household/
physical environment during childhood/adolescence ac-
counted for 10% of variation in adolescent fast food
intake and sedentary behaviors and 50% of adolescent
overweight. Interestingly, household effects on MVPA were
substantially greater in young adulthood (accounting for
50% of variation) compared with adolescence (when
household effects accounted for 10% of variation). Our
results underscore the importance of household and physical
environments as determinants of behavior, leaving a lasting
impression on youth that may affect future decision-making
and the adoption of healthy behaviors in new environments
later in life.
Moreover, our findings indicate that environmental ef-
fects may vary, becoming more influential in determining
phenotypic extremes (as evidenced by the increasing house-
hold component accounting for variation in BMI-for-age z
scores, risk for overweight, and overweight, respectively).
These findings suggest that in conducting genome-wide
linkage studies to identify obesity-related quantitative trait
loci, the practice of specifically targeting pedigrees with
phenotypic extremes in childhood (32) may not be helpful
because the effects of environmental influences seem to be
larger in individuals with phenotypic extremes during ado-
lescence.
Although our findings show a substantial influence of
young adult household environments on frequency of fast
food intake (accounting for 12% of variation), other sig-
nificant effects of households were not detected. At this
stage of the life course, however, individuals may have been
exposed to their new environments for relatively short du-
rations. The environments of young adults may have not
been stable for a long enough time period to substantially
influence these behaviors. Therefore, detecting environmen-
tal effects on some behaviors may be possible only later in
adulthood. Future research is needed to assess individuals in
mid-adulthood, where environmental effects may be more
pronounced.
Interpretation of our findings requires additional caveats.
Firstly, our diet measures are broad indicators of dietary
patterning and do not provide quantification of energy bal-
ance, which is likely under both genetic and environmental
control. Furthermore, our findings show a noteworthy im-
pact of unmeasured/unknown (residual) effects on outcomes
of interest, especially behaviors that are difficult to measure
with precision (e.g., activity and dietary characteristics, in
comparison with BMI). In particular, between Waves II and
III, genetic and household effects generally decreased,
whereas residual effects increased. These residual effects
may represent several different factors including differential
responses of individuals to similar exposures (e.g., house-
hold/neighborhood environmental exposures) and/or mea-
surement error. More importantly, residual variation may
jointly affect numerous weight-related phenotypes, as illus-
trated by our bivariate analyses, and, thus, may be important
to explore.
In addition, our estimates of genetic effects may be mar-
ginally inflated. For example, twins may share additional
household, parental, or other influences that other siblings
living in the same household do not share, thus violating any
equal-environment assumptions (11). In our analyses, these
effects would be included as additive genetic effects. Our
study design is limited by not sampling related individuals
living in different adolescent households, thus reducing our
ability to precisely distinguish genetic and adolescent
household effects and potentially influencing effect estimate
stability. Thus, we suggest that future work build on twin
and extended pedigree models to include detailed measures
characterizing specific attributes of shared and non-shared
environments (among related and unrelated individuals) to
better understand determinants of health behavior, tease
apart residual effects, and describe factors that may vary
between siblings in a family.

Despite these caveats, our findings provide important
insight into obesity etiology and, to our knowledge, are the
first to use these methods in a large longitudinal sibling
sample to quantify environmental and genetic influences on
BMI and health behavior during this critical life stage.
Although a strong genetic component of resting energy
expenditure has been previously established by twin and
family studies (e.g., 33), the importance of heritability in PA
and sedentary behavior has been less studied. Familial re-
semblance in physical performance, exercise response, and
long-term exercise frequency has been demonstrated in
adults (34­37) and, to a more limited extent, in children
(38,39), although the literature has not been entirely con-
sistent in documenting these similarities (40). In adoles-
cence, we estimated that the variance accounted for by
additive genetic effects of PA was 60% and of adolescent
weight status, fast food intake, and sedentary behavior was
30% to 35%. Genetic effects on these factors were similar
(although somewhat lower) in young adulthood, except for
genetic effect on BMI (estimated to be 50%).
The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a critical
life course stage, reflecting a phenomenal jump in obesity
risk (1). These results illustrate important environmental
influences on weight gain, PA, and dietary characteristics
during the transition to adulthood, particularly highlighting
the substantial role that household and physical environ-
ments play in establishing healthful behavior patterns that
can persist even after young adults have established new
households that are independent of their parents and family.
These findings underscore the increasing need for obesity
prevention strategies aimed at the household environment in
childhood and adolescence.
