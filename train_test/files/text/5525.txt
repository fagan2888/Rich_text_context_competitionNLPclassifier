Narrative theory has the potential to provide an explanation
for criminality over the extended careers of what Moffitt
(1993) called "life-course" offenders, where onset begins in
early adolescence and continues into late adulthood. As life-
course offenders are by definition repeat offenders (Halliday,
2001), many also go through periods of "versatility" before
"specialising" in particular offense types (Farrington, Synder,
& Finnegan, 1988; Klein, 1984). Versatility in this context
means different offense types, such as dishonesty, vandal-
ism, and violence, and can be clustered around certain age
groups (Soothill, Francis, & Fligelstone, 2002). Complexity
arises because these different offense types are typically
studied independently and also underpinned by different
models such as "trait-driven" or "dispositions" toward
aggression and impulsivity, or rational choice making mod-
els. Collectively, the field represents a number of disparate
areas of inquiry.
A theoretical framework that assists in linking these dis-
parate areas may have potential for developing an increased
understanding of life-course offenders and aid in the devel-
opment of detection, prevention, and desistance work. Life-
course offenders are viewed as being responsible for the
largest portion of recorded offenses (Halliday, 2001; Tarling,
1993). Moreover, Canter (1994) and Cornish (1994b)
observed that criminals' accounts of crime commission take
a narrative form; so, taken together, there is utility in explor-
ing narrative theory for this genre of offender.
Narratives are about bringing order and coherence to a
protagonist's life so that both sense and meaning can be
made of it (McAdams, 1996). Working with notions of
coherence and meaning can shed light on what guides life-
course offenders to make decisions about the type of offenses
that they engage with and how they manage their way out of
the offending cycle.
Maruna (2001) applied narrative scripts to explore both
desistance and persistence in offending. Although
Maruna'sfindings are yet to be "replicated" (Presser, 2009),
lack important definitions to key terms such as "script" and
the epistemological orientation of the approach (Hockey,
2014), as well as its limitations in terms of why desistance
occurs (Healy, 2012), the principal findings were that desist-
ers found new "redemption" scripts. These new scripts
enabled desistance through a remodeling of the "self" while

Narrative Theory Applied to the
Autobiographies of Three Life-Course
Offenders
David Hockey1,2
Abstract
The written autobiographical accounts of three life-course offenders, which were published following extended life-course
offending, were analyzed using a theory-led thematic analysis. The protagonists were each responsible for a broad range of
acquisitive and violent crimes, although different offense types are often studied as separate entities. The utility of narrative
theory was explored as a life-course theory by contrasting its framework with these disparate areas of inquiry, along the
developmental trajectory of the protagonist's account. Findings showed that onset began with trait-driven and versatile
offending, which progressed toward specialization, incorporating modus operandi and rational choice making. Specialization
was underpinned by themes of violence and control. The concluding themes dealt with the process of desistance, which
was facilitated by a series of cognitive shifts, allowing these offenders to retain a core element of the "self." Results further
showed that narrative-identity played an influential role in the development of specialization and eventual desistance, but less
so with onset. Narrative theory has the potential to aid understanding of the criminal life-course trajectory, which in turn
can assist in both detection and rehabilitation processes.

retaining some coherence to the past. This allowed these ex-
offenders to make sense of that past and move forward with
new ways of being, including core ideas and believes from
the old "self." More recently, Youngs and Canter (2012b)
argued that narrative theory when considered at the point of
offending may also have the potential to link identity, emo-
tion, and cognitive processing. They devised categories that
drew on narrative theory to explain narrative themes, which
influence the offender at the point of the offense. This
approach builds on what Presser (2009) saw as stories being
situated in the antecedents of crime.
However, Ward (2012), and Ward and Marshall (2007)
see stories as metaphors rather than individuals creating fic-
tional personas which they set out to become. Narratives
contain identities, a plot, actors, and a context. This also
links the past with future events, together with an individu-
al's goals and intentions. Two models of narrative theory
briefly reviewed here suggest that the framework has poten-
tial and utility for criminogenic applications.
The M. M. Gergen and Gergen (1984) model consists of
the following features. A "goal state" or "valued end" must
be established to succeed as a narrative. Narratives are struc-
tured in such a way as to generate a connectedness and
coherence which creates a sense of movement or direction
through time. Events must be selected in such a way as the
goal state is rendered more or less probable. As one moves
from one event to another, one approaches or moves from the
desired goal state, hence a sense of directionality. There are
three forms to this: (a) progress toward the goal is enhanced,
which the protagonist is developing or building; (b) in the
regressive narrative, things get worse over time; and (c) in
the stability narrative, the protagonist has incidents and
images linked in such a way that things remain the same. The
theoretical framework is concerned with meanings assigned
to movements, rather than the reporting of specific concrete
facts or the accuracy of the relationship between facts. The
arrangement of facts is only important in relation to the goal
state. The meanings within autobiographies are not exclu-
sively private but are limited at the outset to a vocabulary of
action that possesses currency within the culture.
In contrast, the McAdams (1996) model, while consisting
of some overlapping features (e.g., less about facts and more
about meanings), differs in that it composes an heroic narra-
tive of the self that illustrates essential truths about the self.
The heroic myth exists inside the mind and is embedded in
the complicated series of accounts. It is the central story from
the various episodes told. The model consists of a narrative
mode (concerned with human wants, needs, and goals) as
opposed to a paradigmatic mode (scientific thinking).Agood
autobiography puts a life into story form complete with set-
ting, characters, recurring themes, images, and the self-con-
scious reconstruction of human time through narrative.
Initially, elementary children think in concrete terms where
they learn about rules and principles. During late adoles-
cence, they become narrators and self-conscious myth
makers, before that there is no life-story, no identity. There
are four types of mythic forms: Comedy and Romance
(Optimistic tone); Tragedy and Irony (Pessimistic tone).
Characters now consist of motivation, which older children
begin to comprehend. These motives exist within personality
which derives from the internal dispositions. Theories of
motivation, which are held to help organize behaviors, con-
sist of two phases: first strivings: power, autonomy, indepen-
dence, status, experiences, rich with emotional excitement;
second strivings: love, intimacy, interdependence, accep-
tance, interpersonal experiences subsumed with the experi-
ences of the emotion joy. At this point, children begin to see
human behavior as purposeful and organized. Modality
evolves into agency and communion, which organize a great
many human wants (e.g., needs, desires, and goals). Agency
represents a striving to separate from others and breaks down
into two subsections. People high in power motivation tend
toward a preference for experiences of feeling strong and
dominating the environment and are likely to take risks.
People high in achievement motivation tend toward a prefer-
ence for experiences of competence. Communion represents
a desire to lose individuality and merge with others. This in
turn breaks down into the two subsections of intimacy and
love. Those with overlapping desires for intimacy and love
are able to relate to others in warm, close, and supporting
ways. High levels of intimacy motivation are revealed in the
ways they speak with friends and in social groups.
Although not every aspect of the two theories are appli-
cable to the criminogenic environment, there remains a suf-
ficient framework that can be applied. Although in taking-up
Presser's (2009) call to further explore the potential of narra-
tive criminology, the study here does not advance a particular
approach. It does not follow Presser's "constitutive"
approach, which epistemologically privileges language as a
linguistic devise for minimizing agency and sociologically
derived notions of the self, from those made available cultur-
ally. However, it does draw from McAdams (2012), in that
this study is in the context of exploration of psychological
theory.
The utilization of autobiographies within research is typi-
cally derived from in-depth interviews, which are subject to
impression management devices and issues with accuracy
(Snook, Dhami, & Kavanagh, 2011), hence the unease that
some criminologists have in accepting their validity (Presser,
2009). However, where the purpose is to explore the con-
struction of the narrative, the concern for precise detail and
impression management is negated because the narrative is
about how a protagonist makes sense of their life and how
they cast themselves (Presser, 2009). The events that a pro-
tagonist draws from to create their story are the construction
of the narrative. Within that, the narrative-identity is the pro-
tagonist's attempt to produce their image around their behav-
ior. Furthermore, a protagonist's account can be compared
with other sources, such as official data, criminal records,
and empirical literature. If the account conforms to these
Hockey 3
sources, it is more likely to derive from actual experiences.
In an exploratory approach such as this, starting with
accounts that are grounded in this way links a protagonist's
narrative construction to what is already known about life-
course offenders, independent of the narrative framework.
One way in which to consider whether narrative theory
has utility for understanding life-course offenders is to
explore the written autobiographies of ex-offenders and map
these disparate areas of inquiry onto the accounts, while con-
trasting the results with the narrative framework.
As one purpose of narrative theory is to identify how the
protagonist renders the events into a story, including making
sense of disruptions (Murray, 2003), the written autobiogra-
phy provides a rich source of descriptive data relating to
what the protagonist sees as important to their story, includ-
ing its presentation. The accounts used here contain post-
event rationalizations and reflections upon offending
activities, some of which may not always be encapsulated by
interview methods.
Method
Participants/Materials
The written autobiographies of three United Kingdom, male
ex-offenders were analyzed (Boyle, 1995; Foreman, 2008;
Smith, 2004). These protagonists were chosen because they
were a good fit to Moffitt's (1993) life-course offenders;
Halliday's (2001) repeat offenders, and Farrington et al.'s
(1988) and Klein's (1984) versatile offenders. Jimmy Boyle
was a gangland enforcer in Glasgow during the 1960s. He
was eventually given a life sentence for murder, during
which time, and in his 30s, wrote his autobiography. Freddie
Foreman also became a gangland enforcer in London during
the Krays era and beyond. He received a number of long
prison sentences, though not a life sentence. His autobiogra-
phy was written during his late 70s, some years after his
release. Noel "Razor" Smith, also from London, eventually
received a life sentence resulting from repeated armed rob-
bery convictions and prior sentences from the 1970s through
to the late 1990s. Smith wrote his autobiography during his
early 40s while serving his life sentence. All three offenders
originated from underprivileged backgrounds, were fre-
quently in trouble at school, began offending during their
early teenage years, served a number of prison sentences
throughout their criminal lives, and eventually desisted dur-
ing the mid or later stages of life.
Procedure/Analysis
A three-stage exploration of the data was conducted. First, all
offense-related material was collated. This included pre and
post rationalizations, descriptions, and reflections. The data
were grouped and coded according to the following broad
themes: trait-driven, rational choice, versatility/specialization,
Modus Operandi (MO), and desistance. These were later
refined by the analysis (see results below). As the purpose of
the study was to compare the trajectory of life-course offend-
ers in the context of these competing theoretical orientations
and a general narrative framework, the theory-led approach
(Hayes, 2000) was utilized. This is incidentally compatible
with both realist and relativist epistemologies (Braun &
Clarke, 2006) as well as several methods of analysis (Willig,
2003). This approach seeks to identify existing theories that
explain the data rather than identifying only data that support
a priori theory or devising new theories from the data.
Arguably, alternative theories may have been compatible with
narrative theory or with some of the data groupings, but that
would have defeated the purpose of the study, which was to
explore the capacity of the narrative framework to handle the
complexities of competing theories linked to versatility and
specialization.
This approach had two purposes: first, it offered a mea-
sure of validity to the autobiographies by comparing the
accounts with what is known about the offending patterns of
some long-term offenders, while alerting us to how some
offenders actually transverse a number of theoretically con-
flicting areas of study. Second, it facilitated organizing the
groupings into temporal stages to discern the relationship
between narrative theory and the temporal stages of the crim-
inal life course. In practice, these two stages were integrated.
The third stage of the analysis explored the meaning of the
narrative for the protagonist(s). Here, existing theory was not
used to guide the analysis. Meaning was explored through
the emplotment and depending on the epistemological
approach taken, meaning can be attributed through privileg-
ing language as in Presser's (2009) "constitutive," post-pos-
itivist position or within a realist epistemology (May, 1996)
as taken here. Nested within Presser's (2009) constitutive
approach, Youngs and Canter (2012a, 2012b), and Canter
and Youngs (2012) stress the importance of the "here and
now" of offense decisions. This in turn results in an appeal to
a culturally available narrative-identity, played out by the
offender at the point of offending. A realist epistemology
does not reject the notion that offenders make "here and
now" decisions. Rather, it emphasizes enduring dispositions
and constructs such as cognition. The purpose of a realist
approach is to explain, while a post-positivist is typically to
describe. The McAdams approach, which emphasizes inter-
nal constructs, falls within the realist epistemology, while
culturally available resources may become the vehicle which
a protagonist subsequently adopts or aspires toward.
Within realism, language is not privileged in its own right,
rather extracts are treated as items of data (Hockey, 2014).
Results
These first five themes deriving from the first two stages of
the analysis relate to different chronological and spatial peri-
ods in the trajectories of these life-course offenders. The
4 SAGE Open
third stage yielded the narrative-identity, emplotment, and
the resulting story.
Theme 1: Trait-Driven Behaviors
This theme is about cyclical behaviors that dominate the
lives of those individuals who neither understand these
drives nor are able to control them, despite the deeply
destructive consequences that arise from them and was par-
ticularly relevant during the early adolescent period.
Research has shown that many young offenders have
traits that hinder normal development and socialization
(Crick & Dodge, 1994, 1996) which are stable across the life
course (Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington, & Milne, 2002). These
traits typically manifest as "aggression" (Huesmann, 1994;
Huesmann & Eron, 1989; Huesmann, Lefkowitz, Eron, &
Walder, 1984) or impulsivity (Ross & Fabiano, 1985).
Huesmann et al. (1984) administered a variety of proce-
dures (e.g., Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
Scales [MMPIS] and peer nominated aggression score) to
870 participants from a semi-rural New York state county,
whose modal age was 8 years at the time these initial mea-
sures were taken. They also interviewed 75% of the parents.
At age 19 years, 211 boys from the original cohort were re-
interviewed, of which, 198 males were again re-interviewed
at aged 30 years, along with 165 spouses. Furthermore, data
on 542 of the original cohort (some of whom had been re-
interviewed) was obtained from the New York state criminal
justice system. Results revealed that where high levels of
aggression were shown in 8 year olds, aggression remained
stable at 19 and 30 years of age, including acts of criminality
(e.g., r = .30, p < .001, n = 190, MMPIS; and r = .29, p < .001,
n = 193, self-report). Impulsivity is viewed as an absence of
information processing between impulse and action (Ross &
Fabiano, 1985), exhibiting a lack of self-control (Gottfredson
& Hirschi, 1990) resulting from social skills deficits
(Freedman, Rosenthal, Donahoe, Schlundt, & McFall, 1978).
Boyle aged 13 years experienced his first period of cus-
tody, "The thought of returning to the remand home was
worrying me very much as the few hours I'd spent there had
been enough and I only wanted to go home and I'd never get
in trouble again" (p. 39).
Although he may have meant it at the time, it did not stop
him from reoffending and soon found himself experiencing
the same anxiety:
I was overjoyed when I was out and sincerely meant it when I
told my Ma that I would never get in trouble again. I told her this
again and again, and with my whole heart and soul this was what
I meant. Why when feeling like this did I return time and time
again? I never wanted to get into trouble and this feeling was
passionately strong. (p. 48)
Smith wrote, "At the age of fourteen I was a criminal in
the making. I had very little fear of anything, I was willing to
take on dangerous gambles on little more than a whim, and I
hated the Police" (p. 44).
Foreman reflecting on his late teenage years of violence
wrote about his lack of forethought and loss of self-control:
Although young men at the time we never considered the
implications, if someone died as a result of a fight you could
very easily find yourself facing a murder charge. In spite of that,
you continued to risk life and liberty by doing battle with others.
And "I went over the top on a number of occasions and I
would put that down to the madness of youth," and "As
young men we had no fear. Nobody wanted to lose their free-
dom or their life, but there was literally nothing that could
frighten us" (p. 12).
The responses to prevailing events were spontaneous, and
although they may have regretted the consequences later, it
did not prevent repeat behaviors. In other words, they were
repeatedly impulsive and aggressive, they could not control
their urges (Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990). Traits can domi-
nate the adolescence of an individual, particularly if there are
insufficient interventions during childhood. For Huesmann
and Eron (1989), it is the innate factors that produce the cog-
nitive structures that predispose the child to habitual aggres-
sion. These internal dispositions (McAdams, 1996) are the
innate aspects of an individual's character and are observable
in 2- to 3-year-olds. For example, studies on twins have
shown that antisocial behavior maybe more deeply rooted in
the genes than prosocial traits (Krueger, Hicks, & McGue,
2001). Here, 170 pairs of monozygotic and 106 pairs of dizy-
gotic twins completed a 198-item multidimensional person-
ality questionnaire and an antisocial self-report questionnaire.
Individual differences for negative emotionality and a lack of
constraint were highly correlated with antisocial behavior for
those in non-shared environments. Of the different models
tested (i.e., genetic variance with shared environment [AC],
and genetic variance with non-shared environment [AE]), it
was found that antisocial behavior was linked to AE, 2 =
1.79, p < .05. What appears to influence onset in life-course
offenders (Moffitt et al., 2002) are a number of dysfunctional
traits that have been observed to endure across the life course
(Huesmann & Guerra, 1997), particularly in the absence of
intervention or self-rehabilitation. The presence of these
traits may explain the difference between children within the
same families or social backgrounds, experiencing similar
social risk factors who offend while others do not (see
Farrington, 1996, for a review of multilevel risk factors).
Smith reflecting on his adolescence wrote, "though I was
slowly learning to suppress my own natural instincts, I was
not yet fully mature" (p. 193), while Foreman wrote,
"Looking back I have learned to understand some of the
forces that dictated my actions" (p. 12). They were often con-
fused by the cyclical process, suggesting that they lacked the
capacity to be able to appreciate or control these drives.
Furthermore, during their adult-offending years, they each
Hockey 5
made references to committing random offenses impulsively
and out of desperation, despite long periods of offending as
self-proclaimed professionals.
An alternative view is Presser's (2009) "Constitutive"
approach in that cultural identities influence a protagonists
narrative-identity and role. However, given that onset was in
early adolescence and prior to identity formation (McAdams,
1996), the question for the Constitutive approach here would
be "how can they choose a cultural influence." That is not to
deny an interaction with cultural influences, but with early
teenage offending being pre narrative-identity and the
weight of evidence relating to internal dispositions, it
appears more logical that dispositions, not cultural influ-
ences, predominantly drive early offending. As later stages
in the analysis below suggest, cultural influences may play
an increasing role.
Theme 2: Opportunity and Versatility
This theme is concerned with how individuals seek-out or
take up new opportunities as they are presented.At this stage,
there is no commitment to a specific set of criminal offenses
but there is an underlying consistency to the process of
criminality.
Two strands of the research field, "opportunity," under-
pinned by Cornish and Clarke's (1986) Rational Choice the-
ory, in conjunction with Cohen and Felson's (1979) Routine
Activities theory (RAT), and "versatility" (Farrington et al.,
1988; Klein, 1984), appear to converge during this period of
offending. Rational Choice theory is concerned with the
principle of "least effort" and the calculation of minimizing
the risk of failure against possible gains. This operates in
conjunction with RAT, in that offenders seek-out the neces-
sary role of "opportunities" (Clarke, 2010) within the envi-
ronment typically habituated.
At 12 years old, Boyle would steal from shops on the way
home from school, "We found it exciting and soon we were
deliberately stealing, going into shops on the way home to
take whatever we could" (p. 27). Reflecting on a new oppor-
tunity, Boyle aged 13 years recalls the time when chewing-
gum machines were being installed to shop fronts all over the
district, "These machines made a fortune as everyone was
using them, but their accessibility was very tempting to us
who roamed the street" (p. 35). Boyle was eventually caught
and given another period of custody. By the time he was
released, the chewing-gum machine opportunity had gone.
However, Boyle was soon stealing coal to sell, "Eventually
we gave-up trying to get the coal legitimately and decided to
steal it" (p. 44).
As a teenager, Smith was still finding his way in the crim-
inal world and had not settled on a particular offense type in
which to earn money, "we would drive around looking for
things to nick and bring back to sell" (p. 243). Although he
continued to do random car-related offenses, when an oppor-
tunity came along to cash stolen giro checks, he took
advantage of it, "The Giro firm were always looking for a
new face to take the checks into the post offices, and I did a
bit of that for a while" (p. 255).
At aged 18 years, Foreman joined a gang of girl shoplift-
ers, "I teamed up with a load of girls known as the Forty
Thieves" (p. 41). After that was over, Foreman continued to
take up any viable opportunity that came along, "George and
I were always open to fresh opportunities, like the one that
presented itself at George's own workplace" (p. 67).
These examples reveal that throughout their adolescence,
each of them moved from one money making scheme to
another as new opportunities became available, while previ-
ous schemes ceased to exist or remain viable (Crawford &
Evans, 2012).
Adolescent versatility appears to be influenced by the
opportunities that are available at a given moment.An instru-
mental element of versatility then is opportunity. Opportunity,
in part, derives from an offender's environmental constraints
(RAT). Suggestively, an impoverished calculation of risks
versus benefits, albeit impulsively assessed, informs the
decision making of offending.
This period of versatility, while not exclusively related to
the adolescent years is certainly dominant during this stage
and appears to precede specialization. A pre-requisite to
offense specialization is the evolvement of "offence scripts"
(Cornish, 1994a).
Theme 3: Habit, Routine, and Offense Scripts
This theme is characterized by the procedural knowledge of
repeated sequences and refining the procedures through
experience. Offenders develop a system or set of procedures
which facilitate the smooth running of a criminal activity.
Through direct experience or vicarious means (Bandura,
1989), they learn how to build techniques into the routines,
which increase their prospects of committing offenses
(Cornish & Clarke, 1987).
Script theory (Schank & Abelson, 1977) is considered to
be a mode of processing information at a basic level. The
main characteristics of the theory are that there is a routine
which develops from rehearsal or habit. The routine is
designed to achieve a concrete goal such as eating in a res-
taurant. As the script holder becomes more familiar with the
routine, less cognitive processing is required and so it
becomes more automated. The notion of scripts is further
elaborated by Cornish (1994b) who viewed them as a par-
ticular form of schemata. Schemata's are mental constructs
that organize information about something (e.g., a restau-
rant). Scripts are the "dynamic" form of the schemata because
they move the script holder (e.g., a customer) through the
scenario. A number of studies regarding the cognitive pro-
cessing of criminal behavior across a range of different
offense types have compared the basic principles of the the-
ory with the processing styles of habitual offenders (Cornish,
1994a, 1994b; Cornish & Clarke, 1987; Hammond & Brown,
6 SAGE Open
2005; Hockey & Honey, 2013; Huesmann, 1994; Huesmann
& Eron, 1989; Michael, Hull, & Zahm, 2001; Nee & Taylor,
2000; Tunnell, 1992; Ward & Hudson, 2000; Wright &
Decker, 1994). Furthermore, script-style processing directs
attention toward behaviors consistent with it (Ceci, Fitneva,
Aydin, & Chernyak, 2011), hence the cyclical process. In the
context of offenders' routine lifestyles (Brantingham &
Brantingham, 1984; Cohen & Felson, 1979; Wiles &
Costello, 2000), habit appears to develop in two ways: first,
the utilization of the routine "into" a typical activity and, sec-
ond, the mode of processing as a minimalist function, per-
haps as a heuristic device (e.g., Cornish & Clarke's, 1986,
principal of least effort) at a more general level.
At age 13 years, Boyle was learning about methods for
committing burglary, "One of these methods was known as
`grafting' which was finding a shop with an empty house
next to it or above it and making a hole in the roof or through
the floor and going in that way" (p. 52). During these bur-
glaries, Boyle had acquired a series of techniques designed
to enable the burglary and reduce the risk of immediate
apprehension.
Smith had developed into a bank robber during his late
20s and had acquired a smooth, efficient routine for commit-
ting the offense. His gang targeted banks at the time when
security was at its most vulnerable and the potential gains
were at their highest, "For us the hard work was in finding
out which day the reserve was expected and this was mainly
done by picking a good-sized bank and putting it under
observation for a while" (p. 11).
At age 24 years, Forman had developed into a prolific
burglar of commercial premises and had a series of tech-
niques built into his routine designed to reduce the risk of
getting caught, "We would return to the store and walk
around inside the shop, trying to set off hidden alarms" (p.
74). They would then hide for a while to see if the police
turned up before going back inside the building and carry on
with the burglary.
Nee and Meenaghan (2006) found that experienced bur-
glars displayed the characteristics of expertise as they talked
their way through the decision making of a hypothetical bur-
glary scenario. Topalli (2005) also found that the decision
making of violent offenders equated to specialization when
compared with non-offenders. This "here and now" crime
scene efficiency is often confused with intelligence, which
has an unclear role in its contribution to crime (Blackburn,
2001) and is an over inflated perception of the rational choice
making process. For example, Cornish and Clarke's (1987)
cost benefits analysis results from the rehearsal of simplified
routines, which focus on immediate or short-term goals. An
overlooked but central component is that these offense scripts
are "here and now" (Ross & Ross, 1995) goal-tied problem
solving mechanisms, similar to Piaget's (1962) concrete oper-
ational thinking stage. Just as the child develops more elabo-
rate detail in the games being played through daily experience,
the habitual offender develops more elaborate detail to the
crime scene behavior through similarly limited processing. It
is this observed temporal development that creates the illu-
sion between the here and now thinking of the trait-driven
behaviors and the perceived efficacy or agency underpinning
the misunderstood rational choice model, hence Cornish and
Clarke emphasis a "bounded rationality." The realization of
what one has done to one's own life as well as to others does
not occur until later (see the desistance and emplotment
themes below). Moreover, Hockey and Honey (2013), and
Hockey (2016) found that a group of apprehended offender
primarily focused on how to commit a burglary, while the
non-apprehended offender group primarily focused on how to
avoid detection. The processing capacity of the apprehended
offenders at the crime scene remained within the parameters
of concrete processing (Ross & Ross, 1995; also see
Farrington, 1996, who noted that habitual offenders tended to
do less well on abstract tasks than non-offenders, while per-
forming well on concrete tasks). Indeed, Canter and Youngs
(2010) described offenders as "limited" people, while Morgan
(2002) provided a breakdown of the dysfunctional character-
istics of the prison population. This suggests that agency is
bounded and is more about how to commit an offense or
"how to construct a narrative-identity" (Ward & Marshall,
2007) than the offender having the abstract capacity to see
beyond the "here and now" of offending.
Theme 4: Specialization, MO, and Narration
This theme is characterized by choice making in terms of
offense type and how it is committed. In this context, offense
type refers to the "specialization" of an offender to focus on
particular crimes deriving from early versatility. However,
research has indicated that specialization is more about crim-
inogenic themes (e.g., Donald & Wilson, 2000; Soothill,
Francis & Fligelstone, 2002; Yokota & Canter, 2004) rather
than Klein's (1984) specific offense types (Youngs, 2004).
Another strand to this line of investigation has been pursued
through studying the MO, which is effectively the offender's
idiosyncratic style embedded within the general sequence for
committing a crime.
There has been long-standing support for the notion that
offenders have an MO, which provides the basis of how the
given offender commits crimes (e.g., Alison & Eyre, 2009;
Homant & Kennedy, 2006). Canter and Youngs (2010)
described the MO as a pattern of behavior that is rather more
specific than the general style of an offense. An MO is
thought to derive from a schema that an offender holds about
the way in which a given crime type unfolds (Jackson &
Bekerian, 1997). Therefore, a particular offender's MO will
hold idiosyncratic detail which is embedded within the gen-
eral offense script.
However, within the context of a narrative framework,
what is of interest is whether there is an interaction between
offense type or specialization, MO, and narrative-identity.
This includes the manifestation of a narrative-role, which is
Hockey 7
not limited to cognition as in the offense-script framework.
As Youngs and Canter (2012b), and Canter and Youngs
(2012) argued, narration begins to combine emotion, iden-
tity, and cognition in the decision making of the criminal act.
In this respect, if an offender holds a narrative identify, deci-
sions may derive from the offender's perception of which
behaviors are appropriate or desirable to adopt in a crimino-
genic situation, hence a narrative-role. Presser's (2009)
notion of "narrative influencing lines of action" may become
salient at a given moment resulting in a behavior selection
(e.g., Ward's, 2012, "narrative product"). Narrative-identity
broadly equates to an offender's self-concept or self-identity
(Canter & Youngs, 2010) but with a dynamic output within a
social context (K. J. Gergen & Gergen, 1988).
Youngs and Canter (2012b) developed a four-category
typology of the central themes that they found to be important
in offenders' immediate criminal actions. Building on themes
(i.e., Professional, Hero, Victim, and Revenger) derived from
the Canter, Kaouri, and Ioannou (2003) study, Youngs and
Canter (2012a) administered their "Narrative Roles
Questionnaire" to 71 offenders with an age range from 21 to
61 years old and a mean of 34.5, incarcerated for a mixture of
offense types. The results showed separate self-awareness on
the identity-focused items. For example, while some offend-
ers saw themselves as being weak (e.g., I was helpless; Victim
theme), others saw themselves as being strong (e.g., I was like
a professional; Professional theme). Within these categories,
the "professional," as with Merton's (1957) innovator, appears
to be the closest fit to the protagonists here.The "Professional"
category denotes the offender as someone who is doing a job.
They are qualified and specialized. They see themselves as
highly skilled, intelligent, and competent.
Furthermore, their choice of offense type was related to
their perceived capabilities, which included comfort with
"confrontation" over what Walsh (1986) described as "people
avoiders" (i.e., typically burglars are people avoiders, while
shoplifters, robbers, and pick-pockets are people acceptors).
Similar groupings have been further developed (Youngs,
2004), and accordingly, the protagonists here would addition-
ally fall into the "expressive" category where the offender
uses violence as the style of interaction to exert control.
Boyle's principal criminal activities involved an element
of providing security to protect his moneylending and alco-
hol selling black-market business, as well being a gangland
fighter. "We were now the top mob so with a little luck we
would expand and develop things and make plenty of
money," and "We were going from strength to strength and
the financial side was blooming. Moneylending was a lucra-
tive business" (p. 140).
As a bank robber, "Smith" would have needed to be pre-
pared to take people on in a direct confrontation. The central
component to his offending relied upon the threat of or if
necessary the actual engagement with violence to obtain
money, "Both me and Andy were doers, up-front men who
enjoyed being in the thick of it" (p. 440).
Foreman's post-adolescent criminal days also relied on a
physical presence,
Whenever we did a bank or vault job, I never did the burning
open that was left to Ron and big Georg and Mick. Me and Alf
used to cop for anyone who came back to check us out. We'd
wrap them up and make sure it was safe to carry on. (p. 89)
Within the narrative framework, the narrative-identities
and corresponding narrative-roles of Boyle, Smith, and
Foreman were that of "hard men," "tough guys" who would
use violence as a means to achieve their goals. They each had
far more confidence than doubt in their abilities to take on
opposition during times of physical conflict, and this was
reflected in the type of crimes that they committed (i.e.,
acquisitive crimes but underpinned with violence).
The propensity toward a genre of offense types or "spe-
cialisation" derives from certain characteristics (Donald &
Wilson, 2000) including an offender's perceived skill set or
personality traits. Within the narrative framework, this
appears to influence narrative-identity formulation and
offense types, which together with the offender's related
event-schema, influences the subsequent "narrative-role"
(Youngs & Canter, 2012a). The narrative-role in repeat
offenders is presumably expressed through the offense script
(Cornish, 1994a, 1994b), which is the general sequence to
committing the offense, embedded within that is necessarily
the offender's MO.
Theme 5: Desistance
This theme is characterized by the somber tone of reflection
on a past life that failed to live up to early expectations and
hopes. It is a recognition that something has gone terribly
wrong and cannot be put right.
According to Maruna (2001), desisters hold a redemption
script which casts them as victims of society, where they were
involved in crime to achieve power in an otherwise bleak situ-
ation. Within his model, deviance becomes a trap, but when
the chance to desist occurs, desisters can accomplish what
they were always meant to do and they can give something
back to society. This suggests that there comes a point when,
if an offender is given the right opportunity at the right time,
they will rework their scripts to facilitate desistance. Within
the redemption script, a series of internal shifts take place to
enable this, but these shifts occur as a result of favorable
changes in the holders' external environment. The past is
made sense of and rendered as not being completely pointless
by retaining perceived culturally valued elements of the old
self, which support the growth of a new man. This is particu-
larly so if they can find roles or occupations that provide the
same sense of empowerment and potency that they were
seeking through criminality (Maruna, 2001).
Boyle used hatred of the guards as motivation to him to
keep going:
8 SAGE Open
The only way to pass time was to do exercise and reading, and
thinking thoughts of hatred. My former life was far in the
distance and I would try not to think of my family as it hurt too
much. (p. 179)
He began to develop a mission in which to expose the
brutality of the guards where he languished, "For the next
week we concentrated on getting the story out to the press.
We had this obsessive belief that getting it into the papers
would be the panacea although earlier experience had shown
us differently" (p. 216). This was a mission about survival
more than about reform. He hated the system and the people
who worked in it. For him, they were bullies and cowards
who took advantage of their superior positions.
Eventually an opportunity for desistance was presented.
He was initially highly suspicious and reluctant to accept it.
He was sent to the newly established Barlinie special unit,
designed for a small number of prisoners. Rehabilitation was
far more humane than he had previously experienced. It took
time for adjustment to this, but eventually he recognized how
a shift in emphasis could keep his mission alive while also
improving his own quality of life, "I could see that bit more
clearly now, realising that the unit could have the potential to
show that change was needed and could be made within the
system" (p. 243).
Smith also used hatred as a means of survival:
The more they prodded, poked and ordered me around, the more
I grew to hate the bastards. I could feel my hate roiling and
rumbling within me, like thick molten lava seeking the smallest
crack to erupt out of, but I clamped down on it, set my face on
neutral and used hate as the fuel that drove me. (p. 57)
He found he was able to control it enough to call upon when
needed to either fight the system or motivate himself to keep
going during periods of despair. As time went on he discov-
ered a new way of channeling this hatred, "By now I was
more into fighting the system with the written word than
throwing digs at screws" (p. 409). This eventually changed
again as his mission began to develop into a more construc-
tive tool.
The prison governor visited Smith soon after his reception
and offered him a deal, "I could stay in Highdown and not go
back to Dartmoor on condition that I would cause no trouble
for his staff and I would agree to start up an in-house maga-
zine" (p. 422).
This series of cognitive shifts in their missions did not
occur without these opportunities. This was not simply a re-
storying of their lives, but change occurred through a deeper
and more fulfilling purpose (Ward, 2012). A simplified illus-
trative model might look something like this: (a) hating the
system and using violence to fight it, (b) motivated by hating
the system but fight it through legitimate means, and (c) not
hating the system, but still fighting against its perceived
injustices with legitimate means. Boyle and Smith had both
experienced many moments in custody where they realized
that their lives up to that point had been for nothing and were
simply squandered with little future ahead of them. Although
similar to Maruna (2001), where "new scripts" could be con-
structed with the narrators' retaining some elements of the
"old self," new ways to move forward were quite different
here. The protagonists'attributed their offending to their own
character inadequacies and their retention of old character
elements was to enable a continuation of their fight against
the system, which was in contrast to Maurna's (2001) desist-
ers who made sense of the past and used it to emerge as better
people. This point becomes important when considering the
"emplotment."
Theme 6: Emplotment
This third step of the analysis is more about meanings
(McAdams, 1996) than patterns of events, while also draw-
ing from different theories to help make sense of those narra-
tives (Murray, 2003).
Using dominant discourses (Willott & Griffin, 1999) that
effectively sustain and reproduce the social status quo, the
protagonists describe themselves as "good" criminals,
"chaps," and "professionals," while today's criminals are
seen as people without honor or code.
Boyle wrote,
The "Criminal Code" isn't a thing that has been written up by
top gangsters. It is an unwritten code of ethics. There are done
things and things that are not done. It isn't the done thing to
"grass" or inform on anyone. It isn't the done thing to "bump" or
cheat someone from a robbery that you have all taken part in.
There are lots of these unwritten rules that could fill another
book but these are just two examples that exist between guys in
crime and on the whole they abide by them. (p. 99)
Smith wrote,
I had always had this strange notion that armed robbery was an
honourable profession. I didn't go around coshing pensioners
for their bingo money, or burgling people's homes or raping
women and children; I was the cream of the criminal classes, a
"blagger," one of the heavy mob, a modern-day highwayman. I
didn't steal from poor people's pockets, I robbed the rich, the
banking and insurance institutions. People who could afford it.
The only "victims" of my crimes were the faceless money-
shufflers who had to tally up what was nicked. I was almost a
Robin Hood figure, for fuck's sake! Or was I? (p. 7)
Foreman wrote, "I never robbed poor people or broke into
homes. We robbed only business and factories and did jump-
ups with lorries. We considered that respectable and honest
thieving" (p. 82).
They describe themselves as superior criminals to others.
Offenders often talk about other offenders in a downward
social comparison (Maruna, 2001). These statements are
Hockey 9
examples of how they see themselves while reflecting back.
These references to "code of ethics," "honourable," and
"respectable" denote highly valued virtues in society,
Presser's (2009) "cultural context" and the appeal to these
underpin the reconstruction of their past lives while neutral-
izing or minimalizing the effects of their role in offending.
This suggests a naïve attempt to make sense of their past so
as to position themselves as having been in control of their
lives when that is not certain (i.e., particularly the trait-driven
phase), prior to the development of McAdams's (1996) nar-
rative-identity phase. In many ways, this is at the core of the
emplotment because it is not only about justifying the life-
style but also trying to make sense of it after desistance and
while retaining the self-concept through the self-narrative
and positioning it within socially valued conventions.
Without these rationalizations about their pasts, it is very dif-
ficult to not feel that their entire lives were wasted up to that
point.
The emphasis of some stories over others facilitates this
coherence (McAdams, 1996), and cultivates an identity of
being one person over time and across circumstances. These
self-defining memories are essential to ones sense of self
(McLean, 2005). It is the concordance from discordance
(Ricoeur, 1994), or the winning out over a lifetime of disrup-
tions (Murray, 2003) in the form of cyclical prison sentences
and the preceding behavioral traits that they could not make
sense of at the time. Furthermore, techniques of neutraliza-
tion are seen by Presser (2009) as a forerunner to narrative
criminology; this rationalization part of the emplotment cor-
responds to the basic principles that support Sykes and
Matza's (1957) assertions. However, how these neutraliza-
tion techniques are implemented in the emplotment when
considering Hamlin's (1988) point--that it is unclear which
came first, the delinquent act or the belief justifying it--sug-
gests an iterative process in which narrative construction
evolves with criminal development. Ward and Marshall
(2007) described narrative-identity as a dynamic and some-
what fluid process. Hence, the protagonists later render an
account that makes sense in a way that did not during its
unfolding. In doing so, they can only draw on those cultur-
ally available discourses (Presser, 2009) and so submitting to
the socially dominant ideologies, retrospectively see them-
selves as having been fully informed agents who were in
complete control of their lives.
The need to reconcile the past results from a shift in
aspects of the belief system, while retaining continuity and
conveying a message about who the narrator really is, but is
constructed without appreciating the earlier trait-driven
behaviors and lack of a developed agency. As Maruna (2001)
acknowledged, there may not be a language or discourse
available to describe these changes.
For example, Foreman wrote, "Throughout my life, I have
always felt revolted by liberty-takers and bullies. In the eyes
of the law and society I am seen as a villain, but I have always
strived to be quiet, polite and well mannered" (p. 160). Here
Foreman makes sense of his past without appreciating the
traits that underpinned the early offending by seeing himself
as having at least some justification for his lifestyle when
referring to people who act in an inappropriate way. He then
seeks retrospective clarity and continuity by describing him-
self with the socially valued attributes by always being
"quiet" and "polite," when the evidence suggests that he
unwittingly held a distorted and mixed belief system.
Another important feature both of the narrative and the
resulting "emplotment" is "reputation," which appears to
have played an important role in the identity formation of the
protagonists here. This is a subplot of the emplotment in that
behaviors and rationales relating to the reputation are consis-
tent with the rationales of the emplotment (e.g., formidable
but fair). Reputation also appears to be related to the offense
type(s) in which Boyle, Smith, and Foreman specialized
(Farrington et al., 1988; Klein, 1984), as well as its influence
on the MO or the way in which the offenses were carried out.
After slashing another guy in a gang fight at age 14 years,
Boyle recalls,
Within days I was a force to be reckoned with and some kids
were saying that I was as "mad as a brush." There was a sort of
hero worship about all of this and I was placed on a higher
pedestal by all my own gang, but like reputations in other
fields you've got to deliver the goods otherwise you're in
trouble. (pp. 57-58)
As time went on, violence also began to enter his thieving.
By the time he had reached the age of 18 years, he had
already spent a number of periods in custody and on one such
occasion recalls, "I only knew that I wanted to be out and big
in crime" (p. 107).
Similarly, Smith reflects, "I craved the recognition of
being a `face' in, and out of, prison, and I loved the respect I
got from others in my world" (p. 7). He did things to main-
tain his reputation, "So that other criminals could say, There
goes Razor Smith, he's a diamond geezer. One of our own"
(p. 478).
Foreman reflects on his time during his mid teenage years,
"I was quite well known and already had a bit of a reputation
as a street fighter" (p. 38) and later in adulthood, "There was
no limit to what you would do. People knew that, so you held
that bit of fear and respect and it was true of the situation at
the time" (p. 84).
For Stevens (2012), an individual's identity derives from
the capacity to keep the narrative going and reflects a recon-
ceptualization of identity formulation that is not trait driven
with a fixed core throughout life, but a reiterative activity.
However, this view is too narrow as it ignores the develop-
mental phase of the narrative-identity and how that may con-
tribute to its construction and maintenance, as well as the
body of evidence that does support the notion of early trait-
driven behaviors. Whatever the conceptualization of identity,
reputation becomes important and this is borne out by the
10 SAGE Open
comments of the protagonists' here as well as other offend-
ers. For example, Courtney (2008), who was another violent
criminal during the Krays era and an associate of theirs as
well as Foreman's, alludes to this notion of honor among
some criminals. He claimed to be inspired by how he saw the
Krays and the presence that they exuded. Similarly, James
(2003) wrote that to survive in the prison system, it was
essential to at least appear like you could look after yourself
in a fight. Maguire and Bennett (1982) noted that the offend-
ers in their study were keen to be associated with those
offenders with big reputations.
Discussion
Central to narrative theory is narrative-identity and accord-
ing to McAdams (1996) narrative-identity begins to develop
in later-adolescence. It is predisposed to create identity along
certain thematic lines, including biological, cognitive, and
socially related processes. This identity formulation appears
to emerge around the time that specialization in offending
begins to take shape (Farrington et al., 1988; Klein, 1984),
which is sometime after the onset of offending for Moffitt's
(1993) life-course offenders. Indeed, Presser (2009) regarded
this as unchartered territory.
In the absence of narrative-identity formulation (McAdams,
1996), early onset appears to derive from a different source
and this surely needs to be addressed before narrative theory
can be fully realized in the offending context. For example, it
may be that traits drive early offending behavior leading to
repetition, resulting in routines and habit formation, of which
constitutes the offense script (Cornish, 1994b). Direct rewards
such as material gains and further opportunities, including
reputation, presumably also feed and reinforce the cycle.
Within the McAdams approach, as late adolescence draws
near, agency begins to play an increasing role but may initially
be limited to refining offense decisions (i.e., offense type and
MO). The offender is drawn toward maximizing material ben-
efits by offending in ways that are not only familiar and com-
fortable, but which maintain and enhance reputation.
Theoretically, this would account for the simultaneous emer-
gence of offense specialization and narrative-identity, which
in turn is built around the self-concept (i.e., who one believes
oneself to be, not necessarily who one is; Ward, 2012; also see
Fiske & Taylor, 1991, for a detailed discussion). In this respect,
choice making begins to play a greater role than before, but its
rationality is bounded (Cornish & Clarke, 1987) within the
parameters of these life enduring traits and social settings,
while agency capable of controlling the self (Ward, 2012)
remains under-developed in these chaotic and "high-volume"
offenders (Halliday, 2001). At the height of their bounded
choice-based offending, the protagonists here could well be
described within Youngs (2004) "Expressive" category,
Youngs and Canter's (2012a) "Professional" category, and
Merton's (1957) "Innovator" category. During this period,
there appears to be a convergence with McAdams's (1996)
second modality of agency, which characterises high power
motivation, strength, domination and risk taking.
The eventual cognitive shifts noted in the desistance
theme above and to some extent Maruna's (2001) general
findings facilitate a different channeling of the offender's
traits from before and are which expressed through a change
in the social context. It appears more likely that a fully devel-
oped agency, or "higher-order" cognitions (Brehm, Kassin,
& Fein, 1999), needed to be able to take control of the "self,"
does not emerge until much later in those offenders who are
habitual due to their antisocial traits (e.g., Boyle, Smith, and
Foreman desisted much later in adult life). Furthermore,
although traits may fail to predict behavior in a single situa-
tion it is behavioral aggregation that enables trait claims
(Matthews & Deary, 1998). In addition, in contrast to
Moffitt's (1993) life-course offenders, Moffitt's adolescent-
limited offenders presumably do not develop narrative-iden-
tities based on criminality, but for other reasons, desist from
offending around this time. The timing of this narrative-iden-
tity formulation is entirely consistent with the age crime-
curve for adolescent desisters and those that continue
offending. Maruna's (2001) claim, that desistance is a prob-
lem to trait theorists, is difficult to support not only in respect
of these wider considerations, but in light of the protagonists
here, who found ways to reform while managing their traits.
Philosophically, Ricoeur (1994) conceived of two distinct
and polarized but overlapping values, which are identity as
"selfhood" and identity as "sameness" or as oneness and
together form the narrative-identity. Selfhood is the cogni-
tive part, the choice making of the identity which may be
based on a set of beliefs about the self (e.g., self-identity).
Sameness is the component that retains a continuous element
across time (Ricoeur, 1994). In the offender context, this can
be understood as trait characteristics which form part of the
"actual-self" or it can be understood as the part of the "per-
ceived-self" that is always seeking to justify one's actions
within cultural values. For Ricoeur, identity takes up position
in the space between these two values of selfhood and same-
ness, and oscillates between them. For Ricoeur, it is ana-
logues to aging, where one's appearance changes over time,
but an identifiable element of the previous remains. In rela-
tion to narrative criminology, it is the slow development and
emergence of agency over time, which ultimately wins out
over the earlier trait-driven behaviors, hence the eventual
desistence. The emplotment is the protagonist's reflective
sense making of the what, why, and how, which has come
after the cognitive shifts have occurred. It is the necessary
drawing on sameness to create a coherence to make sense of
the past and prevent a complete collapse into worthlessness
by creating or maintaining a value to it. A narrative-identity
reframing (Yardley, Wilson, Kemp, & Brookes, 2013)
derives from this process. The story that comes from this is
the tragedy (Murray, 2003) of the missed opportunities and
the realization of "the person one was always meant to be"
(Stevens, 2012).
Hockey 11
Limitations
The main potential limitations of this research are the use of
the written autobiography and the sample size in terms of
whether these accounts are representative of life-course
offenders generally. In addition, they maybe self-written or
produced by a ghost writer working in collaboration with the
protagonist who communicates what is important to them,
although this is ultimately the essence of a narrative. Written
autobiographies provide an offender with an opportunity to
reflect over a longer period of time and consolidate under-
standing with memories in a way that interviews may not.
For example, where Maruna (2001) found that his desisters
attributed their inability to control their offending to outside
forces (e.g., selfishness as being the product of the environ-
ment), Boyle, Smith, and Foreman saw their inability as
deriving from internal strivings, which took many years to
understand and manage. Perhaps these discrepancies result
from the differences between protagonists being able to pro-
duce their own account in their own time, compared with the
dynamics of an interview setting which produces a particular
rendering at the point of narration, "deriving from the imme-
diate social contextual demands" (Prebble, Addis, & Tippett,
2013). Although there is no claim here that these protago-
nists are representative of the offending population, it is
interesting to note that the accounts were similar in many
ways beyond simply being life-course offenders as alluded to
by their developmental pattern. Clearly, more autobiogra-
phies should be analyzed to explore these issues further.
Future Implications
One issue with using narrative theory as a general theory of
life-course offending is that according to McAdams (1996),
the principle model utilized by Maruna, 2001, "narrative-
identity," does not appear to emerge until after the early onset
associated with life-course offenders. However, children do
develop the cognitive skills for telling stories long before
mid-adolescence (Habermas & Bluck, 2000), although with
limited purpose (McAdams, 1996), and so, more work needs
to be done on this unresolved issue (i.e., does early adoles-
cent offending begin in the absence of a narrative-identity or
does narrative-identity emerge first and play a key role in
influencing early offending). If trait-driven behaviors are
responsible for early onset, two things are plausible: that
Presser's (2009) "Constitutive" culturally available narra-
tive-identities, as postulated by Maruna (2001), Canter and
Youngs (2010), and Youngs and Canter (2012a, 2012b), iter-
atively form the sense-making component to the life-course
offender's "offending" (e.g., offense type and identity) retro-
spective to early onset, or when giving their accounts their
participants draw from "culturally" dominant discourses as
the only available means for them to make sense of it.
Furthermore, while aggression could alternately be
explained through theories of masculinity, impulsivity still
remains less well explained by alternatives to dispositions.
Moreover, the characteristics of impulsivity and aggression
appear to continue to play an intermittent role throughout adult
offending, particularly during desperate times as the analysis
above alludes to (also see Maruna, 2001). The assertions of
Youngs and Canter's (2012a, 2012b), and Canter and Youngs
(2012), "that agency plays a central role in a given offence-
narrative or theme," is not without some merit as offense deci-
sions are made. Nevertheless, further work is needed to
determine the characteristics of this "agency" and how it oper-
ates (i.e., prior to or during narrative-identity formulation). For
example, do offenders freely choose a life of crime or choose
a criminal narrative-identity from a particularly limited pool of
perceived narrative options following onset.
In Healy's (2013, 2014) desistance work, all human
beings have the potential to act agentically, which is capable
of being activated based on the capacity to imagine a new
self that is meaningful and credible. Persistence is not the
result of psychological deficits but the absence of this imaged
identity and so lack incentive to exercise agency. Healy's
research was derived from adult offenders and this refash-
ioned hark back to traditional free-will choice making tends
to become more salient in the later stages of the criminal life
course and appears to have minimum impact on early onset
for life-course offenders, based on the results here.
B. Smith and Sparkes (2009) found that pre-rehabilitation
athletes with life-changing spinal cord injuries (SCI) per-
ceived of a few, but common (among SCI's) ways of future
identities and narratives. For B. Smith (2013), the narrative
habitus is an inner library of narratives that the individual
holds. In their rehabilitation work, they seek to introduce the
SCI athlete with alternative narratives that can successfully
bid for a location within the organization of the narrative
habitus. These ideas have implications for work around
agency in terms of free-will or bounded rationality in the
context of offending.
Finally, theoretical constructs such as "self-concept,"
"traits," and particular versions of "narrative-identity" are
entirely compatible within a micro-level "realist" framework
as they derive from notions of internal mechanisms that can be
studied through standardized approaches (see May, 1996). It is
in the post-positivist approach as outlined by Presser's (2009)
macro-level "constitutive" approach that such concepts are not
epistemologically compatible, as there is no commitment to
the notion of an accessible reality. As narrative theory devel-
ops within the forensic setting, it may be helpful for research-
ers to make explicit their epistemological orientation. As
observed by Ward (2012), this will avoid confusion across the
different ideologies underpinning the various approaches to
narrative theory that Presser (2009) described.
Conclusion
Based on the limited results of this exploration, narrative
theory when applied to life-course offenders does have
12 SAGE Open
utility, but more work is needed as an explanation for early
onset. Thus far, it may be better understood as a theory that
maintains offending and develops it in specific ways. In
this study, its earliest emergence (in terms of narrative-
identity) began with specialization, which is more about
themes underpinning offense types than very specific acts.
However, earlier trait-driven behaviors which are more ver-
satile due to the randomness of opportunities and in the
absence of an offender identity to guide decisions appear to
provide the context and background in which specialization
emerges. This specialization appears to be linked to narra-
tive-identity (i.e., the protagonist's perceived role in a cho-
sen offense type) as well as the emplotment (i.e., the
meanings the protagonist attaches to their role). Trait-
driven behaviors and rational choice models are typically
treated as disparate areas of inquiry, but it is possible to
conceive how one gives way to the other in the same
offender.
