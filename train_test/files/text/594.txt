Abstract
The National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council Twin Registry (NAS-NRC
Twin Registry) is a comprehensive registry of White male twin pairs born in the USA be-
tween 1917 and 1927, both of the twins having served in the military. The purpose was
medical research and ultimately improved clinical care. The cohort was assembled in the
early 1960s with identification of approximately 16 000 twin pairs, review of service re-
cords, a brief mailed questionnaire assessing zygosity, and a health survey largely com-
parable to questionnaires used at that time with Scandinavian twin registries.
Subsequent large-scale data collection occurred in 1974, 1985 and 1998, repeating the
health survey and including information on education, employment history and earn-
ings. Self-reported data have been supplemented with mortality, disability and medical
data through record linkage. Potential collaborators should access the study web-
site [http://www.iom.edu/Activities/Veterans/TwinsStudy.aspx] or e-mail the Medical
Follow-up Agency at [Twins@nas.edu]. Questionnaire data are being prepared for future
archiving with the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA) at the

Michigan, MI.
Why was the cohort set up?
The NAS-NRC Twin Registry was established in the late
1950s within the Medical Follow-up Agency (MFUA), pri-
marily to shed light on the determinants of veterans' health
and to elucidate the role of genetic and environmental influ-
ences on disease aetiology using a twin design.1­4 The mis-
sion of MFUA was to use medical records from World War
II to advance medical research and improve clinical care.
The then director of the National Institutes of Health
described the studies within MFUA as offering a unique op-
portunity ``to follow a whole generation of men and trace
their life history''.5 Original funding was primarily from the
Veterans Administration. The National Research Council
appointed an advisory committee called the Committee on
Veterans Medical Problems (now the Board on the Health
of Select Populations) and subsequently a subcommittee on
twins (now the Committee on Twins Studies). MFUA is cur-
rently within the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the
National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC.
Who is in the cohort?
The registry was launched in 1958­59 through matching
birth certificates for White male multiple births (from all
states except Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,
Maine, Missouri, Utah, Vermont and the city of New
Orleans, thus representing 93% of population of the USA
at the time). Whereas all multiple births were identified, it
was decided that the registry would include only White
men (who made up nearly 90% of the WWII-era service
members) to create a more homogeneous cohort.3
Veterans Administration (VA) records were used to find
twin pairs born 1917 through 1927 where both members
served in the Armed Forces.1,2,4,6 These efforts led to iden-
tifying 15 924 twin pairs, or 31848 individuals.
Starting in 1965, the men were mailed a brief question-
naire (Q1) requesting their enrolment in the study and
including questions to determine zygosity. Of those who
were living, 69.8% responded; 7.9% were deceased.6
Questionnaire 2 (Q2), constituting the baseline assessment,
was mailed after the man replied to Q1. Q2 was an epi-
demiological questionnaire largely identical to a survey
mailed to the Swedish Twin Registry in 1967.7,8 Of those
who had previously answered Q1, 72.6% responded to
Q2; 1.2% were newly deceased.6
Military records were reviewed in 1970 at the National
Personnel Records Center in St Louis, MO, with the ab-
stracted information archived on microfiche in the MFUA
office in Washington, DC. Essentially, 99% of the twin
pairs have birth certificates and information extracted
from their service records, including induction data. If ser-
vice record data are used to compare men selected for the
cohort who did not participate at baseline with those with
baseline data: there is no difference on age at which they
entered the service; those who participated at baseline
served on average 100 days longer; and officers were more
likely to participate than enlisted men. Those who
Key Messages
· The NAS-NRC Twin Registry permits use of classical methods that compare the similarity of monozygotic (MZ) twin
pairs and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, and co-twin control methods that compare twins having a disease (or exposure)
with their healthy (or non-exposed) co-twins.
· Findings show that interplay between genes and environments over time is associated with healthy ageing as well as
with liability to diseases and conditions including cardiovascular diseases, dementing illnesses and age-related macu-
lar degeneration.
· Heritability was greater for manic-depressive psychosis than for schizophrenia and for Alzheimer disease than for
Parkinson disease.
· Key environmental exposures included smoking, which is associated with greater risk of cancer, cardiovascular dis-
ease, poor cognition and eye disease.
· The NAS-NRC Twin Registry is a unique research resource, representing the generation of American men who served
in World War II.

participated had 0.4 more years of education at the time of
enlistment and were taller by 7.5 mm.
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 15 924
pairs in the registry and provides descriptive statistics for
the men who participated at each wave.
How often have they been followed up?
The entire registry has been followed up by mailed ques-
tionnaire (Q) three times--Q3, Q7, Q8--with a fourth
mailing comprising the NEO Five Factor Personality
Inventory. The other Qs were either administrative mail-
ings or were part of ancillary data collection.
The Q3 questionnaire, focused on schooling and earn-
ings,6,9 was sent in 1974 to pairs where both were alive,
had valid addresses and had not requested to be removed
from the registry (N ¼ 12 640 individuals). In all, 72.8%
responded; 0.2% were newly deceased.6 Responses to Q3
were only coded for pairs where both members responded.
The most thorough analysis of representativeness of the
sample and of the pairs who responded was carried out at
Q3.6 These investigators reported that little evidence of
bias was detected. Q3-responding twins were quite com-
parable to the entire twin panel: there was slightly better
survival starting at age 47 compared with the general US
White male population; among responding pairs, rates of
receiving disability benefits were similar to those among all
World War II veterans; a higher percentage had completed
16 or more years of school compared with all US White
male veterans; and twin respondents were more likely to
fall into the highest earnings category than were all White
male veterans or all US White males.

eWe refer to the Qs by their original numbering by MFUA. Q1 (not shown here) was a request to enrol in the study. Q2 constituted the baseline data collection.
Q3 was a follow-up focusing on education and work. Q4 (not shown here) was a request for permission to link to medical records. Q5 was part of the ancillary
NHLBI study. Q6 has been lost to history. Q7 and Q8 were follow-up surveys replicating many of the questions asked at Q2.

In 1985, the second epidemiological questionnaire
(Q7), similar to the first epidemiological questionnaire
(Q2), was mailed to all individuals in the registry. In 1998,
the third epidemiological questionnaire (Q8) was mailed to
all surviving pairs and to `singleton' twins (i.e. whose co-
twin was not available, due to death or lack of a valid ad-
dress) who had previously completed both Q2 and Q7.
A 69% response rate was reported for Q8.10 In 2005, the
NEO Five Factor Personality Inventory11 was mailed to
surviving twins. It measures the personality dimensions
of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience,
Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Questionnaires
were returned by 1670 men.
Mortality updates use the Veterans Affairs' Beneficiary
Index and Records Locator System database, the National
Death Index and LexisNexis. LexisNexis is a corporation
providing an electronic database for legal information and
public records. Dates of death are currently available
through 2012, and updating cause of death is in progress.
Ancillary data collection, described below, occurred be-
tween these waves to target informative subsets of the twin
pairs. These ancillary data are not currently available at
MFUA.
In 1969­72, funded by the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute (NHLBI), a sample of 514 twin pairs from the
registry living near: Indianapolis; Framingham, MA; or San
Francisco, Davis or Los Angeles, CA; were selected for clin-
ical examination. This subset of twins is known as the
NHLBI Twin Study.12,13 Five longitudinal assessments of this
subset took place between 1981 and 2003, including lipid
panels, structural MRI during the last three waves and blood
samples from 711 men in the third wave for genotyping.
The Duke Twins Study of Memory and Aging was a study
of dementia entailing four waves of telephone cognitive
screening with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status
(TICS).14 The sample comprised all twin pairs from the ori-
ginal registry in which both members were thought to be alive
and residing in the USA in 1989.15 Individuals who screened
positive for dementia (N¼ 550 over the four waves) and their
co-twins were given a complete clinical workup, including a
neuropsychological battery and collection of blood or buccal
samples. The second telephone interview of all individual
twins believed to be alive in 1992 included screening not only
for dementia, but also for Parkinson disease, cardiovascular
disease eye disease and cancer. Based on that screening, par-
ticipants were identified for further ancillary studies of
Parkinson disease16 and age-related macular degeneration.17
What has been measured?
Table 2 summarizes the data that have been collected.
Copies of the epidemiological questionnaires may be found
on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Studies of U.S. Veteran
Twins website. The main longitudinal data are the repeated
epidemiological surveys encompassing height, weight, car-
diovascular symptoms, problems breathing, other health
conditions, smoking, alcohol use and other health behav-
iours. There are up to 145 diagnoses reflecting diseases and
hospitalizations from 1936 through 1985 coded using the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) based on VA
admissions records. Also available at one or more times of
measurement are: education; employment history; occupa-
tions of father, mother, spouse and twin brother; whether
the respondent grew up in an urban or rural area; and con-
tact with his twin brother. From service records, branch,
rank and dates of entry and separation were obtained.
There are standardized ability test scores including Army
General Classification Test (AGCT) / Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT) scores for 2438 men and
General Classification Test (GCT) scores for 2386 men.
Classification of zygosity, crucially important in twin
studies, initially relied on responses to two questions: (i)
`As children were you and your twin as alike as two peas in
a pod or of only ordinary family resemblance?'; and ii) `In
childhood, did parents, brothers and sisters or teachers
have trouble in telling you apart?'2,7 At baseline, responses
of both members of a pair were used to classify zygosity
and certainty of the classification. When compared with
blood typing results for 741 twin pairs, agreement was
95%.2 More recently, DNA genotyping has become avail-
able from various ancillary studies. Accuracy of question-
naire classification of zygosity when validated by DNA
markers was 96.8%.18 The zygosity reported in Table 1
uses DNA if available, and the baseline zygosity classifica-
tion based on questionnaire responses, blood typing and
physical similarity2 if DNA was not available. To facilitate
use of all of the data in biometric modelling, the question-
naire classification of zygosity has been recast as the twin
pairs' probability of being monozygotic, rather than as
MZ, DZ and unknown categories, based on a logistic re-
gression model that used available DNA19 as the gold
standard.18
What has been found?
The project bibliography currently includes 367 publica-
tions addressing cardiovascular risk factors, schizophrenia,
air pollution, eye disease, socioeconomic indicators, alco-
hol use, smoking, obesity and cognitive functioning. A list
of publications can be found at the IOM website.
Early publications included methods papers and publi-
cations concerning psychopathology that took advantage
of linkages with medical records from the armed
forces and the VA. For example, in one early analysis of
822 International Journal of Epidemiology, 2015, Vol. 44, No. 3
schizophrenia in the twin panel, the authors found no dif-
ference in incidence of schizophrenia among MZ as com-
pared with DZ twins, although onset in the MZ pairs
occurred at a younger age. The age-corrected pairwise
concordance rate was 15.5% for MZ and 4.4% for DZ
twins.20 In MZ pairs, schizo-affective psychosis had double
the pairwise concordance rate compared with schizophre-
nia, whereas pairwise concordance was similar for schizo-
affective psychosis and manic depressive psychosis.21
Work in this area contributed to formulating the diathesis-
stress theory that the occurrence of schizophrenia reflects
the interaction of genetic vulnerability with environmental
influences (including prenatal environment).22,23
The epidemiological questionnaires have been used in
multiple studies that have helped to establish the import-
ance of smoking in the population's health. A 24-year
mortality follow-up for smoking-discordant twin pairs
identified in Q2 found more than twice the rate of death
among the twins who smoked compared with their non-
smoking co-twins.24 For lung cancer, the relative risk was
5.0 in MZ and 11.0 in DZ smoking-discordant pairs.
Within the NHLBI subsample, several analyses explored
the interaction of measured genes with smoking; for ex-
ample, whereas smoking was associated with poorer cogni-
tive function, this harmful effect was weaker among APOE
epsilon4 carriers than among noncarriers.25 Smoking was

macular degeneration, whereas diet (vitamin D, betaine,
methionine) was protective.26
As the twins have grown older, studies of conditions
related to ageing have emerged. The Q8 questionnaire was
used to derive a trait of `wellness' among the respondents,
who were on average nearly 75 years old.10 Wellness en-
tailed the absence of any of the major chronic diseases
(heart attack, coronary surgery, stroke, diabetes, prostate
cancer). Heritability estimates for wellness were over 50%.
Data from the Duke Twins Study have shown lower
dementia risk associated with greater cognitive activity in
midlife27 and with occupations that require use of
data, academic skills or extensive vocational training.28
Exposure to solvents, especially trichloroethylene, ascer-
tained from task-based occupational histories, raises
Parkinson disease risk.29 In the NHLBI sub-study, glucose
load measured over 30 years previously was associated
with risk of death from coronary heart disease, controlling
for other vascular risk factors.30 These studies demonstrate
the value of the data in connecting exposures over the life
cycle to later life morbidity and mortality, while control-
ling for genetic and environmental factors shared between
co-twins.
What are the main strengths and
weaknesses?
The NAS-NRC Twin Registry is a unique longitudinal
sample, representative of their cohort, the so-called
`Greatest Generation'.31 Nonetheless, it must be kept in
mind that the sample was selected to include only White
male pairs in which both members survived and passed a
physical examination to enter military. The longitudinal
twin design is a strength. Being a twin registry, investiga-
tors can study the interplay of environmental with genetic
influences on health and socioeconomic conditions. The
wealth of data collected from these men over 40 years,
including self-assessments as well as record linkage, pro-
vides the basis for better understanding the contributions
of a lifetime of influences to longevity and health in
old age.
The main weakness stems from the lack of infrastruc-
ture funding to MFUA for maintaining the registry.
Therefore, neither health utilization records nor cause of
death have been comprehensively updated for over two
decades, although updating of death records is currently in
process. Further, the impact of the men's military experi-
ences has not been fully explored, and a fire in 1973 des-
troyed original service records for a substantial proportion
of the members of the registry, making further data gather-
ing and verification of data problematic. Biological
samples, including genotyping, were only collected from
men who participated in ancillary projects in which they
were evaluated in person--these represent <5% of the co-
hort. Finally, all of the data from the ancillary projects
have not been integrated into the registry, although this
too is in process.
