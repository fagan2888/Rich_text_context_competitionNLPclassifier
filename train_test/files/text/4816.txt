Introduction
Geographically, Nigeria is a country located in the Western
African region, bordering the Gulf of Guinea, between Benin
and Cameroon. It is made of three major ethnic tribes, the
Hausas (occupying the north), the Yoruba (occupying the
west), and the Ibos (occupying the east). It has a total area of
approximately 923,768 sq. km as well as 4,047 km in land
boundaries (Udogu, 2001). Culturally, Nigeria is the most
populated country in Africa; its population has risen above
160 million. The population is extremely diverse with well
over 250 ethnic groups, some numbering fewer than 20,000
people. Most of its population is concentrated in the southern
part of the country, as well as in the area of dense settlement
around Kano in the north. Between the two areas is a sparsely
populated middle belt (Olaniyan, 1984).
Historically, the Republic of Nigeria came under colonial
rule of the British (United Kingdom) during the second half
of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century,
making English its common language. The British depen-
dencies of Northern and Southern Nigeria were merged into
a single territory in 1914, commonly known as the amalga-
mation of northern and southern Nigeria. On October 1,
1960, Nigeria gained its independence from the British rule.
Today, Nigeria is a democratic nation with freedom of reli-
gion. While 50% of the population is associated with Islamic
worship, Christianity and African Traditional practice com-
prise 40% and 10%, respectively (Olaniyan, 1984).
Culturally, Nigeria is a multitribal system in which every
tribe wants to excel or suppress the other, so they are not on
the same level playgrounds. Every person in politics is
regionalized and people are capitalizing on that. Once lead-
ership is zoned in the country, one cannot expect to get the
best, but Nigerians are trying to live with what they presently
have. There are more than 300 different tribal groups in
Nigeria, all of which belong to the political definition
"Nigerian" but are distinct from one another in terms of cul-
tural practices. Added to this are economic disparities among
the various groups, as well as potential for conflict on reli-
gious grounds, especially between the long-established
Muslim population and the rapidly growing Christian
sector.
Since its independence in 1960, civil war, military coup
d'état, and consequent military governments have created a
Nigerian political environment that is not always seen as

Understanding the Impact of Leadership
in Nigeria: Its Reality, Challenges, and
Perspectives
Nichodemus O. Ejimabo1
Abstract
This critical ethnographic study focused on identifying the leadership practices of past and present leaders involved in the
operation of the Nigerian government, with emphasis on the Eastern Region. The author was committed and determined
to discovering a pattern of meaning through its natural setting, was equally interested in the process rather than outcomes,
in context rather than specific variables, and in discovery rather than confirmation in order to gain in-depth knowledge and
understanding of the issues and problems associated with the leadership situation in the country. For clarity, the investigator
used Northouse leadership approach to understand the leadership in the current Nigerian leadership situation. Twelve
past and present leaders in the government operations of the Eastern Region of Nigeria participated in the study, and the
leadership assessment instrument survey questionnaire was used to support the study. While the study showed a great need
for change in leadership, the results of the study revealed that most of the leaders and policy makers in the Eastern Region
of the country lack effective leadership skills for the positions they hold. The study also suggested some recommendations
for improving the current leadership situation in Nigeria.

stable. These circumstances have constantly destabilized and
jeopardized Nigeria's democracy as well as the political
states that border Nigeria. There has been a constant and
utter lack of rule of law on the part of the government and the
governed. The most urgent issues in Nigeria today are the
lack of management of the public trust, corruption, govern-
ment instability, and the maintenance of decaying simple
amenities and infrastructures in the nation. The issue of the
upsurge of corruption is endemic and troubling. Transparency
International consistently rates the levels of corruption in
Nigeria among the highest in the world. Pervasive corruption
appears to permeate many levels of the Nigerian society (Eti,
Ogaji, & Probert, 2006).
Hargreaves (2002) in discussing about the ways of
improving basic health care in Nigeria claimed that Nigeria,
once heralded as the beacon of Africa, has fallen somewhat
short of this potential. Years of plutocratic repressive dicta-
tors and military rule, coupled with widespread corruption,
have resulted in large-scale neglect and deterioration of pub-
lic services. According to Kew (2006),
the giant was brought to its knees by 20 years of brutal and
corrupt military rule, which left a legacy of executive dominance
and a political corruption in the hands of Nigeria's so-called
"godfathers"--powerful political bosses sitting atop vast
patronage networks who view the government primarily through
the lens of their own personal enrichment. (p. 73)
According to Eicher and Liedholm (1970), the pressing
problems of everyday survival remain the highest immediate
priority. Since the oil boom of the 1970s, the nation's
economy has been in crisis despite continued expansion in
oil production. Inefficiency in governance has further dete-
riorated the Nigerian economy. Political instability and lack
of proper accountability in the country have severely impeded
the ability of successive governments to implement eco-
nomic policies for the common good of the people, thus cre-
ating a lack of basic amenities for the people in the country.
For Kirk-Greene and Rimmer (1981), the solution for
addressing Nigeria's problems and consolidating democratic
governance in the federal republic lies in having a govern-
ment or leadership that works on the principles of good gov-
ernance and is, most importantly, accountable to the Nigerian
people. Good governance in Nigeria is essential to its stabil-
ity and growth and that of the economies of West African
countries in the Subregion. While corruption and abuse of
power long have been features of Nigeria's economic and
political landscapes, they do not have to remain in the coun-
try's future. Studies designed to examine the positive chal-
lenges of good leadership as an ongoing leadership process
(Northouse, 2004) may have application to Nigeria's future.
In addition, more scientific studies as well as understanding
from the experience of past and present Eastern Nigerian
leaders will help highlight more specifically the problems of
Nigeria's leadership. Figure 1 shows some of the major prob-
lems that are associated with the current situation in the
country.
These identified problems are affecting the common peo-
ple as well as increasing the wave of corruptions and misman-
agement in most regions of the country. The current leadership
situation in Nigeria is associated with chaos and conflicts.

This study continues to explore the current challenges
among elected leaders in Nigeria. The people of Nigeria, like
most people in other developing countries in Africa have
been disadvantaged and neglected by their elected leaders,
lawmakers, and politicians. Many Nigerian leaders are faced
with the dilemma of meeting the needs of its poor millions,
who have to eke out their living from primary productive
activities and maintain the integrity of natural resource and
the environment. These leaders have misrepresented and
ignored the voice of the people, the common good, peace,
and stability of the country, and have equally hindered most
people from economic growth and opportunities due to their
race, lack of skill, greed, and power. They sometimes create
obstacles to future growth and vision of the country. Lipset
and Lenz (2000) stated that cultures that stress economic
successes as an important goal but, nevertheless, strongly
restrict access to opportunities will have higher levels of
corruption.
In assessing the leadership situation in Nigeria, Adejimi
(2005) indicated that in Nigeria, most of the policy makers as
well as those involved in decision making are engaged in
bribery, egoism, power, and trade liberalization. They are
distracted to an extent that they forget the nation's policies
aimed at improving the lives of people in the society.
Although people in a normal society are expected to be hon-
est, law-abiding and hardworking, instead, in the Eastern
Region of Nigeria, the lukewarm and unethical attitude of
some of their leaders (and those who are supposed to main-
tain and enforce law and order) are leading the people to
engage in corrupt behaviors.
While some studies have provided insight into the con-
straints and obstacles that many Nigerians, especially people
in the Eastern Region of Nigeria, experience in the hands of
bad leaders, there is a need for more studies regarding effec-
tive leadership and accountability to enable improvements
and leadership capabilities on their leaders and policy mak-
ers.Agreat number of leaders and policy makers are occupied
with mismanagement and poor leadership skills in their
administration of the country. They neglect and ignore poli-
cies that are aimed at improving the standard of living among
the people of the region. This research, guided by the leader-
ship approach of Northouse, centered specifically on a
selected group of 12 past and current leaders of the Eastern
Region of Nigeria in an attempt to understand their leadership
practices, experiences, and involvements in the operation of
the Nigerian government. This study was meant to enable the
present leaders and policy makers to better understand the
process of leadership as it affects the people of the country
with regard to its perspectives, challenges, and realities.
Support of Literature
The study was aimed at understanding the perception and
views of some past and current government leaders toward
people in leadership as well as how decision-making process
operates in the Eastern Region of Nigeria, in their response
to the challenges of leadership and mismanagement in their
nation. In this regard, it is of vital importance to understand
some of the main factors, especially religion, history, tribal,
ethnicity, power, colonialism, as well as political, get-rich-
syndrome, fraud, and corruption elements that have contin-
ued to undermine good leadership in the Nigerian situation.
These factors and others have contributed greatly to the
instability, poverty, and suffering among the people of the
nation.
The review of related literatures in this study reveals a
great concern for enhancing the understanding of the current
impact of leadership in Nigeria and the challenges the peo-
ple are experiencing due to poor governance and manage-
ment in the entire country. The literature review consists of
five main sections, namely (a) cultural and historical con-
text, (b) understanding decision-making process, (c) social
reform, (d) ethical standards, and (e) the Northouse leader-
ship process. The literature review enabled the author to
identify a resemblance, what has been done and what needs
to be investigated with regard to the topic. For instance,
some recent studies have suggested that Nigeria is a corrupt
and a mismanaged country that needs attention as well as an
effective leader. The country needs people who are edu-
cated, sincere, and honest in administration and leadership
styles (Adejimi, 2005).
Regardless of where corruption occurs, the individual or
group involved, and what causes it or the form it takes, the
facts and outcomes still remain that, in Nigeria, corruption
has contributed immensely to greed, mistrust, insecurity, and
injustice, as well as to the poverty and the misery of a large
segment of the nation's population. In the views of Lipset
and Lenz (2000), poverty and income inequalities are tied to
corruption. According to Walter (1990), Nigeria is the giant
of Africa and many of its outstanding leaders have been kept
in prison or in exile for the sake of criminal act and embez-
zlement of public funds, as well as lack of accountability and
good leadership. Corruption is responsible in a large measure
for broken promises, the dashed hopes and shallow dreams
that have characterized the lives of most Nigerians in the past
few decades, he noted, adding that Nigeria was unlikely to
meet the Millennium Development Goals (Walter, 1990).
Mismanagement, government irregularities, and corrup-
tion in Nigeria and other developing countries are among the
major problems of national growth and development. These
problems and their practices occur in nearly every level of
bureaucracy, ministries, departments, and polity, as well as in
the upper and lower administrations and agencies in the
nation. In the mind of McMullan (1970), a public official is
corrupt if he accepts money or money equivalent for doing
something that he is under duty to do anywhere, that he is
under duty not to do, or to exercise a legitimate discretion for
improper reasons (McMullan, 1970). Corruption and ineffi-
ciency in public services are linked to weak governance and
leadership. The political and economic environment of a
4 SAGE Open
country determines, to a large extent, the standard and qual-
ity of its public services and administrations. There is virtual
agreement among observers that corruption and political and
economic instability have been responsible for derailing
Nigeria's growth and development and primarily explain the
suffering and poverty in the country. Leaders and decision
makers in Nigeria should understand that a leader is one who
can lead a group of people to accomplish common goals in
the right direction, with cost efficiency, within the time
frame, and achieve the desired outcomes (Nahavandi, 2004).
Cultural and Historical Context
The understanding of the culture of the people of any group is
an authentic way of knowing them. In the views of Frake
(1977), culture is not simply a cognitive map that people
acquire, in whole or in part, more or less accurately, and then
learn to read. People are not just map-readers; they are map-
makers. People are cast out continually into imperfectly
charted seas of everyday life. Mapping them out is a constant
process resulting not in an individual cognitive map, but in a
whole chart case of rough, improvised, continually revised
sketch maps. Culture does not provide a cognitive map, but
rather a set of principles for map making and navigation.
Different cultures are like different schools of navigation
designed to cope with different terrains and seas (Frake, 1977).
In every collectivistic cultural perspective, leaders have a
moral responsibility to take care of their followers and help
them develop their personal cares, to be a consultant for fol-
lowers' personal problems (Bass, 1995). The Nigerian sys-
tem is regimented and the people are following a system that
is slightly different from our cultural way of doing things, the
westernized system is slightly interfering with their own sys-
tem, but they are trying to cope with what it has produced.
Nigeria is a multitribal system where every tribe wants to
excel or suppress the other, and so they are not really on the
same level playgrounds. Every person in politics is regional-
ized and people are capitalizing on that. Once the govern-
ment officials start zoning leadership they will not expect to
get the best, but in Nigerian situation most people are trying
to live with what they presently have.
The beliefs and cultural values can affect and influence
the practice of leadership in any country or region. Leaders
must understand their own values and ensure, through their
consistent behavior, that they reflect their value and share
their vision with their followers (Pielstick, 1998). Morgan
(1997) described culture as an active living phenomenon,
through which people jointly create and recreate the world in
which they live. It is the hope of the researcher that in this
study, strong, effective workable leadership techniques will
be uncovered to help the Nigerian leaders and policy makers
to a new level of understanding and a standard management
of the country.
Culture comprised the assumptions, values, norms, peo-
ple, and their behavior. Each aspect of a cultural element can
be seen as a very important environmental condition affect-
ing the system and subsystem in any society. In the views of
Edgar Schein (1993), culture is a pattern of a shared basic
assumptions that the group learned as it solved its problems
of external adaptation and internal integration, that has
worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to
be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive,
think, and feel in relation to those problems. Nigerian leaders
should be able to understand the diversity of tribes, tradition,
customs, and languages of the different people in Nigeria to
enhance a better and comprehensive leadership style and
effectiveness in governance of the people. The people's cul-
ture is very important and what they think ought to be done
in their society (Hofstede, 2001).
Cultural values and beliefs affect the practice of leader-
ship development, which relates to the values, beliefs, hopes,
and fears of human existences. In Nigeria, culture is a phe-
nomenon that surrounds the people as well as the nation's
heritage. Both culture and leadership are intertwined. Many
people believe in their customs and traditions as a guide to
their way of life. Culture is the sharing of values and beliefs
of a society established through the interaction of human
thinking, feeling, and action. In highly collective societies,
such as Japan, the Philippines, Ghana, Guatemala, Nigeria or
Ecuador, where the social bond among members is very
strong, and people look out for one another, a strong patri-
arch at the top of the social hierarchy tends to emerge as an
effective leader. Such a leader is not only accepted by the
followers but is also expected to protect their interests.
People who have different cultural norms and values require
different leadership styles. Thus, there are no good or bad
value orientations (Hoppe, 1998).
In discussing the current leadership situation of Nigeria,
Fagbadebo (2007) stated that the Nigerian State is a victim of
high-level corruption, bad governance, political instability,
and a cyclical legitimacy crisis. The country's authoritarian
leadership faced a legitimacy crisis, political intrigues, in an
ethnically differentiated polity, where ethnic competition for
resources drove much of the pervasive corruption, and prof-
ligacy. While the political gladiators constantly manipulated
the people and the political processes to advance their own
selfish agenda, the society remained pauperized, and the
people wallowed in abject poverty. This invariably led to
weak legitimacy, as the citizens lacked faith in their political
leaders and by extension, the political system.
Goodling (2003) in discussing Nigeria's crisis of corrup-
tion maintained that Transparency International consistently
rates the levels of corruption in Nigeria among the highest in
the world and pervasive corruption appears to permeate
many levels of the Nigerian society. Nigeria was positioned
at the bottom of Transparency International's most corrupt
nations in 2007, ranking 148 out of the 180 world nations.
Both the outgoing and current administrations expressed
commitment to stamp out official corruption in the country.
According to Ake (1995), decades of efforts have yielded
Ejimabo 5
largely stagnation, regression or worse. The tragic conse-
quences of this are increasingly clear: a rising tide of poverty,
decaying public utilities and infrastructures, social tensions
and political turmoil, and now, premonition of inevitable
drive into conflict and violence.
Despite being the eighth largest oil producers in the world,
Nigeria has the world's third largest poverty level (Goodling,
2003). If these problems are not adequately addressed and
challenged, the whole nation will remain in chaos. Without
adjusting the attitude of the people and without changing our
"enormous moral deficit" our "moral and social disorder"
will not be mended (Etzioni, 1994, p. 9). In his opinion,
Adeseyoju (2006) maintained that corruption is far more
dangerous than drug trafficking or other crimes because
when it goes unpunished, the public loses confidence in the
legal system and those who enforce the law.
Culture, the accumulated shared learning from shared his-
tory, focuses attention on the human side of the nation's life
and thereby makes clear the importance of creating an appro-
priate system of shared meaning to help people work together
toward desired goals and outcomes. Culture requires the
people, especially the leaders, to acknowledge the impact of
their behavior on their environment (Schein, 1993). The
understanding of the people's culture and history can enable
any competent leader in any nation, institution or organiza-
tion to exhibit courage: the courage to embrace complexity,
to stop reducing racial relations as ineffective, and to increase
the possibility of building bridges, managing conflict, and
finding common ground in the nation.
In a nation or culture that stresses participation and auton-
omy, the function of top leadership is not to control but to
support, encourage, and make available hands-on coaching
and consultation to help citizens and employees avoid unnec-
essary frustration and waste of efforts, to increase task-rele-
vant knowledge and skills, and to formulate uniquely
appropriate performance strategies that result in process
improvements (Tsang, 2002).
Situating the Northouse Leadership Process
Most definitions and descriptions of leadership by different
people imply that there should be a good understanding
between leaders and their followers to achieve their desired
goals and objectives. Leadership is all about getting people
to work together to make things happen that might not other-
wise occur or prevent that which ordinarily would take place.
Northouse (2004) defined leadership as a process consisting
of transactions between the leader and the followers: a pro-
cess whereby an individual influences a group of individuals
to achieve a common goal. The paradigm of Northouse sug-
gests that leadership is a process that is ongoing and dynamic
in understanding leaders and followers as it affects the situa-
tion in Nigerian structure. Leadership involves influence; it
occurs in a group context and involves some form of goal
attainment.
The author used the Northouse leadership approach to
guide the study. The Northouse approach to leadership
clearly explained the nature of leadership as well as what is
expected of an effective leader. The paradigm of Northouse,
which states that leadership is a process whereby an indi-
vidual influences a group of individuals to achieve a com-
mon goal (Northouse, 2004) clearly focused on the leadership
style needed in Nigeria. It conceptualizes and identifies the
five basic elements common to the phenomenon of leader-
ship. These five components include the following elements
and themes that form the core "consensus" components of
how leadership is currently conceptualized in the views of
Northouse: (a) leadership is a process, (b) leadership emerges
out of a reciprocal relationship of influence, (c) leadership
occurs in a community or group context, (d) leadership
involves goal attainment around shared visions, purposes,
and values, (e) leadership is intentional about making real or
concrete change.
The aforementioned components of leadership as
explained in the Northouse paradigm suggest that leadership
is a process that is ongoing and dynamic in understanding
leaders and followers in an organization or institution. When
applied to Nigeria, this conceptualization rightly suits the
situation. Northouse (2004) claimed that
Although leaders and followers are closely linked, it is the leader
who often initiates the relationship, creates the communication
linkages, and carries the burden for maintaining the relationship.
(p. 3)
The leadership style in Nigeria is not working effectively
and could be addressed through the guidelines of the
Northouse concept of leadership. Leaders and followers are
involved in effective leadership processes. Leaders need fol-
lowers and followers need leaders to accomplish desired
goals and outcomes (Burns, 1978).
Understanding Decision-Making Process
A good understanding and the establishment of sound deci-
sions and policies are very important for leadership reform.
Thus, growth dynamics cannot simply be measured in eco-
nomic terms. Positive criteria for growth and reform in
Nigerian leadership must include governance, efficiency,
accountability, and democracy of institutions, as well as
involvement of the people. Most of the issues in the country
can be linked to poor decisions and bad policies from the
leaders, and policy makers. Decision makers must first
decide on their values and set goals to insure a fruitful deci-
sion-making process. Their decisions fashion the environ-
ment in which the people of the nation live. Therefore,
before taking any course of action, leaders must discover or
create a set of alternative courses of action and gather infor-
mation about each. Having gathered the information with
which to make a decision, they must apply information for
6 SAGE Open
each course of action to predict the outcomes of each pos-
sible alternative and make a decision for implementation
(Deutsch & Coleman, 2000).
For Kirk-Greene and Rimmer (1981), the solution for
addressing problems and consolidating democratic gover-
nance in the federal republic of Nigeria lies in having gov-
ernment or leadership that works on the principles of good
governance and, especially, is accountable to the Nigerian
people. Many Nigerians who are highly achievement ori-
ented have been relatively reduced to low access economic
opportunities in the current leadership situation in the coun-
try. Good governance in Nigeria is thus essential to its stabil-
ity and growth and that of the economies of West African
countries in the Subregion. The apparent lack of confidence
in the bureaucratic and political processes is a reflection of
the poor governance that has characterized the system for
decades.
In today's society, organizational leadership, decision
making, growth, effective management, and organizational
success are based on the quality of the decisions policy mak-
ers or leaders make. In any country where legal systems fail
to protect the rights of groups and individuals, the risk of vio-
lence and conflict are bound to increase. For Nigerians, effec-
tive leadership and good governance must be for the Nigerian
leaders and decision makers the direct result of knowing their
criteria for success, the scope of their choices and the inherent
risk of each alternative (Nelson & Quick, 2003).
There is a great need for the development and establish-
ment of proper decision, rule of law and leadership styles
among the country's leaders and decision makers that will
include a review of the existing policies, strategies and stan-
dards to ensure that managers and government officials will
continue to achieve efficient and effective management roles
in the country. According to Kotter (1990), leaders must
know how to lead as well as manage. Otherwise, without
leading as well as managing effectively, today's organiza-
tions face the threat of extinction. While leadership involves
change, inspiration, motivation, and influence, management
and effective leadership must focus on the process of setting
and achieving the goals of the nation through the functions of
management, with reference to strategic planning, organiz-
ing, directing, and controlling.
Nigerian leaders and decision makers should be influ-
enced by collaborators while working together to achieve the
common goal of the nation. Nahavandi (2004) claimed that a
leader is anyone who influences individuals or groups within
an organization, helps them in the establishment of goals,
and guides them toward achievement of those goals, thereby
enabling them to be effective.
Social Reforms
Nigerian leaders need clear and comprehensive social reform
to break the cycle of inefficiency in leadership. For a suc-
cessful reform to take place in Nigeria accountability and
transparency have to be guaranteed and the people have to be
involved in issues that affect their lives and immediate envi-
ronment. It was obvious to the author, that one of the major
reasons for the current leadership deficiency in the Eastern
Region of Nigeria and in the whole country in general is that
many Nigerians have not had the simple opportunity to live
and operate in an environment that is under the rule of law. In
the views of Edward De Bono (1990), law and order are the
basic part of the fabric of society, and the society needs to
give priority to this aspect of life because poor quality here
downgrades everything else in the systemic network of the
place.
Northouse (2004) suggested that sociability refers to lead-
ers' inclination to seek out pleasant social relationships.
Leaders who show sociability are friendly, outgoing, courte-
ous, tactful, and diplomatic. They are sensitive to others'
needs and show concern for their well-being. Social leaders
have good interpersonal skills and create cooperative rela-
tionships with their followers. According to Fagbadebo
(2007), transparency and accountability in governance will
increase the sense of national community as well as the level
of system affect.
Ake (1995) has rightly suggested that "democratization of
considerable depth" would be necessary to halt the impedi-
ments created by the problems of poor governance. To ensure
more and better government responsiveness, civil society
actors who have all the capacity to compel their leaders to be
accountable to them should brace up for the challenge.
Deliberate and conscious efforts, borne out of patriotism, are
needed to ensure the emergence of a virile civil society. An
informed civil society is of vital importance to balance the
powers of the Nigerian State. For successful reform to occur
in Nigerian leadership, leaders and decision makers must
possess problem-solving skills. According to Mumford,
Zaccaro, and Harding (2000), problem-solving skills refer to
a leader's creative ability to solve new and unusual, ill-
defined organizational problems. Nigeria needs problem-
solving skills of leaders to help fight fraud and corruption in
the country.
To truly clean up the bad leadership and corruption,
Nigeria needs sound ethical leadership that is rooted in
respect, service, justice, honesty, and community. Leaders
who place fairness at the center of decision making, includ-
ing the challenging task of being fair to individuals as well as
to the common interest of the community they serve
(Northouse, 2004). The country needs people who are edu-
cated, and sincere and honest both in administration and
leadership styles. In the Nigerian leadership situation, self-
less and charismatic leaders are needed to amend the wrong
(Adejimi, 2005).
Ethical Standard Challenges
Ethics codes provide guidelines for the professional conduct
and behavior for managers and employees (Pugh, 1991).
Ejimabo 7
Leaders and policy makers need to make positive laws and
rules as well as implement them to the letter. Laws are not
respecters of persons. Adherence to ethical standards both in
leadership and decision making must be a foundation of the
country's policies. According to Lewis (1991), ethics codes
fulfill the following three purposes: (a) encourage high stan-
dards of behavior, (b) increase public confidence, and
(c) assist in decision making.
A true leader must be virtuous and a person to be trusted
by the governed. This study was concerned with helping
the leaders to exercise leadership in a respectful and self-
less manner for the common good of the people in the
region. Macintyre (1981) affirmed that virtue is an acquired
human quality, the possession and exercise of which
enables us to achieve those goods which are internal to
practices, and the lack of which prevents us from achiev-
ing any such goods. Virtuous leaders either in government
or business are persons of honesty, integrity, and trust
(Dike, 2001; Frankena, 1963; Liebig, 1990). According to
Bowman, ethics is action, the way we practice our values;
it is a guidance system to be used in making decisions. The
issue of ethics in the public sector as well as in the private
life encompasses a broad range of concerns, including a
stress on obedience to authorities, on the necessity of logic
in moral reasoning and on the necessity of putting moral
judgment into practice (Bowman, 1991). Ethics codes are
a tool for clarifying acceptable behavior and provide guid-
ance to managers when dealing with ethical dilemmas
(Lewis, 1991).
Leadership can change followers' attitudes, beliefs, and
behaviors to improve performance (Northouse 2004). They
should encourage their followers to see with a new perspec-
tive and stimulate them to face challenges and solve prob-
lems (Bass & Avolio, 1994). Leaders should help arouse
their followers'uniqueness and potential innovation perspec-
tive for more effective problem solving without direct inter-
vention from their leader (Bass & Avolio, 1990). It is of great
value and importance that leaders have good moral conduct
and ethical responsibility to enable them to attend to the
demands, concerns, needs, and problems of the citizens in
the country. In the views of Burns (1978), discussions of
leadership sometimes are viewed as elitist because of the
implied power and importance often ascribed to leaders in
the leader­followers relationship. Leaders are not above fol-
lowers or better than followers. Leaders and followers must
be understood in relation to each other and collectively
(Burns, 1978).
Research Questions
The purpose of this qualitative critical ethnographic research
study was to understand the perception of selected leaders
and their experiences in regional and national leadership
positions in the Eastern Region of Nigeria. The research
questions were as follows:
Research Question 1: How do selected participants see
their role as government leaders in Eastern Nigeria?
Research Question 2: How does the decision-making pro-
cess operate for leaders in Eastern Nigeria?
Research Question 3: What recommendation do these
participants have for improving political practices in
Eastern Nigeria?
The answers to these and other related questions that have
emerged in the course of the study may provide current
Nigerian leadership and policy makers with information that,
if applied, could enable the people of the country to live hap-
pily and enjoy the common good.
Method
The author used the qualitative critical ethnographic para-
digm to understand the perception of selected leaders and
their experiences in regional and national leadership posi-
tions in the Eastern Region of Nigeria. This methodology
was based on the experiences of the researcher and the
selected participants which focused on identifying the lead-
ership practices of the past and present leaders involved in
the operation of the Nigerian government. The author used
critical ethnographic design to gain in-depth knowledge and
authentic understanding of the issues and problems associ-
ated with the current impact of leadership in Nigeria, with
regard to its reality, challenges, and perspectives. With this in
mind, the critical ethnographic design was used as the most
effective means of carrying out comprehensive, systematic,
and authentic research on the Nigerian leadership situation.
Based on the researcher's judgment and the purpose of the
research (Babbie, 1995; Greig & Taylor, 1999; Schwandt,
1997) and in looking for those who "have had experiences
relating to the phenomenon to be researched" (Kruger, 1988,
p. 150), the key participants were limited to 12 past and cur-
rent leaders who served in the eastern part of Nigeria between
1960 and the present. The participants were selected from
different cities and towns of the eastern part of the country,
and they all have political leadership and administrative
experience in the government operation of the country for a
minimum of 12 years (2 participants had more than 30 years
of experience). The participants consisted of three women
and nine men, with an average age of 45. They also had a
first degree as the minimum education level, although 3 of
the participants hold an honorary PhD. The informed consent
agreement form and the purpose of the research study were
explained to the participants at the beginning of each
interview.
This study was based on a mixed-method, duplicating the
self-designed survey questionnaire developed from the
research questions and discussions from the focus group
interviews. The quantitative survey data were collected as a
response to the questionnaire and used to support the qualita-
tive data in the study. The researcher conducted both
8 SAGE Open
individual and semistructured interviews with the selected
participants forming three groups of four individuals. All
selected individuals and each group participated in three
separate interviews to avoid responses being filtered only in
the single ideas of a particular interviewee. Here, the
researcher chose the researcher role as an active listener and
collaborator "to tell the story from the participants' view
rather than as `expert' who passes judgment on the partici-
pants" (Creswell, 1998, p. 18). All interview sessions were
tape recorded with participant's permission and used as a
check to the field notes of the researcher. This method is
much encouraged in conducting critical ethnographic
research. Because ethnographic analytical procedures vary
by researchers' schools of thought, quantitative as well as
qualitative procedures and instruments may be incorporated,
if appropriate (Bernard, 2002).
Basically, data analysis employed a concurrent nested
model (Creswell, 2003). Having said that, the qualitative
data analysis, which is primarily inductive and recursive pro-
cess, were analyzed and organized into categories to identify
themes or patterns as these facilitated a deeper knowledge
and understanding of the leadership situation in Nigeria. The
questionnaire and final survey revisions were made to sup-
port and improve the content and process of the data collec-
tions, both incorporated qualitative and quantitative items.
Thus, the quantitative data were systematically organized,
analyzed, and given a basic descriptive statistical treatment
in the study. A follow-up research was conducted by imple-
menting focused interviews of the selected past and present
of the Nigerian leaders to corroborate the data from the final
survey and identify additional variables. The author allowed
the selected participants to serve as a check to the study to
ensure immediate validation as to the accuracy and credibil-
ity of the narratives in the data. The constant communication
between the researcher and the selected participants added to
the confidence and validity of the interview transcripts.
Findings
The findings are based on the purpose, objectives, and
research questions of this study as well as examined in mul-
tiple levels (Creswell, 2003) that include three major sources:
(a) open-ended questions posed through interviews, (b)
demographics and observation, and (c) the survey
questionnaire.
Interview Questions
1.Relationshiptoregion'sinfrastructureandManagement:
 a. What is your job?
 b. 
How does your work allow you to interact with the
region's infrastructure?
 c. 
How long did you work in the government
operations?
2. Understanding of leadership process in the Eastern
Nigeria?
 a. 
Can you explain your understanding of leadership
and administration in the government operations?
 b. 
What are the changes when you worked in the past
and now?
3. Perception of leadership process and effectiveness:
 a. 
Can you explain how you see the leadership being
managed today?
 b. Is this different from that when you were young?
 c. What are the opportunities and challenges?
4. What do you think can be done differently to ensure the
trust is preserved?
5. What would you do differently if you had sole control
of the public trust?
Based on the research questions, the interview questions
were developed thematically. The interview questions helped
to provide the structure for data gathering and also served as
a means for recording information that was used in this study.
Demographics
The participants were selected from different cities and
towns of the eastern part of the country, and they all had
political leadership and administrative experience in the gov-
ernment operation of the country for a minimum of 12 years
(two participants had more than 30 years of experience). The
participants consisted of three women and nine men with an
average age of 45. They also had a first degree as the mini-
mum education level, although three of the participants hold
an honorary PhD (Table 1).
Survey: The Leaders Attribute Inventory (LAI)
Survey data
Thirteen Nigerian leaders completed the Leadership as a
Process: Leader Attribute Inventory (LAL; one more than
participated in the survey). All of the participants completed
the attribution items and 12 completed all of the demographic
questions. A general description of the participants shows
that they were primarily male (77%), the mean age was 52.75
years old, the mean years of education was 23.75, and the
mean years of work was 22.67. Further breakdowns of the
demographic information could jeopardize the identities of
the participants. Because there were few participants asked
to complete the survey only descriptions of attribution item
results were needed to support the qualitative findings. The
results for the LAI items are listed in Table 2.
Table 2 shows the minimum score, maximum score, and
means for LAL attribution items (means in bold are the larg-
est scores, means in italics are the lowest scores). Overall,
the survey completers seemed to have a good opinion of
themselves based on the survey results. Only one of the

attribution items mean scores was below 4.00 on a 5-point
scale--Item 15, "I make appropriate decisions about the
length of time it will take to accomplish goals," which had a
mean score of 3.69 (SD = 1.03). The five lowest scored items
seem to relate to each other thematically. The other four
items are "I demonstrate patience when the group cannot
reach mutually acceptable decisions" (M = 4.00, SD = 1.02);
"I am able to appropriately assign tasks and workloads" (M =
4.08, SD = 0.96); "I am able to control my frustration and
stress" (M = 4.15, SD = 1.04); and "I am able to explain
things to the group and to individuals in a clear way" (M =
4.15, SD = 1.09). These items together suggest that there are
many things outside of the leaders' sphere of influence and
suggest a lack of structure and accountability within
government.
However, the attribution items with the five highest scores
suggest that the leaders themselves take their roles seriously
and have a desire to move toward real results. These items
are "I make sure that I understand what we are doing and
why we are doing it" (M = 4.85, SD = 0.96); "I appreciate the
group's confidence in me and take my leadership position
seriously" (M = 4.85, SD = 1.09); "I take my assigned posi-
tion in the organization seriously" (M = 4.83, SD = 0.90); "I
help the group understand the need to come together as a
group" (M = 4.77, SD = 1.26); and "I maintain a confident
professional image" (M = 4.77, SD = 0.94). Due to the small
number of survey completers, no inferential statistical tests
were conducted.
The findings in this study are in line with the Fagbadebo
(2007) perspective that the Nigerian State is a victim of high-
level corruption, bad governance, political instability and a
cyclical legitimacy crisis. Consequently, national develop-
ment is retarded, and the political environment uncertain.
The country's authoritarian leadership faced a legitimacy
crisis, political intrigues, in an ethnically differentiated pol-
ity, where ethnic competition for resources drove much of
the pervasive corruption and profligacy.
Discussion
In the views of the participants in this study, Nigeria would have
been a very wonderful place, but the only problem is those
politicians and retired government officials, those corrupt
politicians, and some people who encourage and influence
corruption and lawlessness in the country, if they can be swept
out of offices or positions, if they can face the law, do what the
law says, not just bribing themselves out of the way and trouble
in everything, especially crimes, things would be better and well
for the common people of the country (Participant A, December
4, 2009).
The stories and experiences of the focus group were the
tools and elements used to discover a pattern of meaning and
achieve result. The roles of the participants could be seen in
most of what the participants shared with the researcher. For
instance, one of the Participants stated that
If somebody commits a crime, goes back in there, goes through
the back door, and give some money and they let him go. If they
can get all those corrupt leaders out of the away, then our country
will be a very wonderful place. (Participant L, January 18, 2010)
Most of the participants agreed that the nation's natural
resources are being wasted and sold and packed in private
pockets. Thus, there are no good roads; the schools are not
there; the hospitals are not equipped, and the transport sys-
tem is neither functioning nor available in most of the cities.
If the money and wealth of the country were spent appropri-
ately, the masses would have had at least good schools, good
roads, good drinking water, electricity, and health facilities in
place. The fact is that these are seriously lacking.
All the participants were very happy to be part of the
study. For them, it seemed that through the study the answers
to their prayers and requests would be accomplished. They
were energetic, motivated, and eager to discover a result. In
sharing their knowledge, stories, and experiences as leaders
and policy makers in the government operations in the
Eastern Region, they also expressed their concerns, sugges-
tions, and recommendations for the current leadership situa-
tion in Nigeria. As Participant C (December 7, 2009) in
telling his stories said,
My role as a leader is to discover the ends and objectives of that
particular group so that we work towards achieving them; and to
do that, I will identify the group proper, the constituents of that
group, what they expect to achieve, as I listen to them, and then
as much as possible, pulling them together, making them
understand individual participation, individual responsibilities;
as much as possible, making sure that the group work as a team,
the group work as a peaceful group, because under a confused
situation, you can never achieve any good you want to achieve.
The situation in Nigeria during the period of this study
was very different from what the country used to be. Most
people were living in poverty, fear, and chaos which moti-
vated, and encouraged armed robbery, killings, and kidnap-
ping to make quick money. Many people preferred to stay
indoors and at home rather than going elsewhere for the fear
of being kidnapped. Movement from one city to the other
was very difficult due to the bad roads and lack of security on
most of the Nigerian roads. While the armed robbers stole
from the travelers, the police extorted money from the com-
mercial drivers, thereby making things difficult for citizens,
and commerce. Yet the participants were determined to be
involved with the study to find a solution to the current situ-
ation. Many of the participants were out and ready to stand
and defend the rights and integrity of the country. Most of
them were angry about the way things are going in the coun-
try's leadership and administration, the suffering and poor
provision of amenities for the people in the society.
As stated earlier, the participants in this study strongly
maintained that Nigeria could have been a very wonderful
place associated with a situation that is favorable to better
Ejimabo 11
living conditions and that encourages growth and develop-
ment, but that condition is unattainable under the present
leadership conditions. Some of the ex-politicians, retired and
former government officials, pose as stumbling blocks to
effective leadership and administration in the country. These
former leaders have refused to exit the public offices and to
relinquish their positions to the new leaders. They used the
past existing leadership protocols of the government system
to either influence or subdue the efforts of the young and
newly elected leaders. They encouraged new leaders to fol-
low their corrupt and fraudulent parts in the administration of
government duties for fear of being probed or punished for
their misconduct in the running of the government opera-
tions by their successors.
These leaders through their conduct encourage and influ-
ence corruption and lawlessness in the country. These kinds
of leaders need to be swept out of offices or positions and
brought to face the law, obey the law, and not allowed to
bribe themselves out of the crimes they committed during
their tenure of office. As a participant emphasized,
If somebody commits a crime, goes back in there, goes through
the back door, and give some money and they let him go. If they
can get all those corrupt leaders out of the way, then Nigeria as
a country will be a very wonderful place to live. (Participant L,
January 18, 2010)
All the participants agreed that the national resources
bestowed on them by nature are being wasted and sold and
packed in private pockets.
There are no good roads; the schools are not there, the hospitals
are not equipped, and the transport system is not working and
available in most of the cities. If the leaders should spent the
country's wealth or money as appropriate, many Nigerians
would not be complaining (Participant E, January 19, 2010).
In Nigeria, the decision-making process somehow is
believed to belong only to a special interest group of people.
The process of decision making is in the hands of powerful
and influential leaders and politicians, who control and
manipulate the justice system in the country to suit their spe-
cial and individual interests. As one of the participants
postulated,
We talk of democracy, government of the people, by the people,
for the people, that is in principle as far as leadership in Nigeria
is concerned. But if leaders are to lead exactly according to that
principle of democracy, things would be different in Nigeria.
But in this country, leaders make laws for other people to follow
and not for them to follow. (Participant D, January 15, 2010)
In the present Nigerian situation, the interest of the peo-
ple and the image of the country are neglected. The law-
makers and some leaders and policy makers with money
and power do not appear to have the interest of the common
people at heart. Laws are made for the common people and
not for the leaders. The decision-making process under the
current situation was not based on the analysis of the needs
of the people. Instead, it is based on political advantage and
exists to favor the rich and the special interests of those in
authority in the entire country. This poor leadership condi-
tion and other negative practices in the country have led
many people to participate in different crimes and illegal
activities. Many of the Nigerian citizens are fed up and
unhappy with the chaotic situation of administration and
leadership in the country. The laws and those who make
them are not transparent and honest in doing what they
were elected to do for the interest of the common good and
the welfare of the country. According to Participant K
(January 20, 2010),
Rules and decisions relating to the country laws are based on the
leaders, for what they can get, it is not actually from what the
people's needs are, even though they can present that to the
people, but they have a hidden agenda for personal issue in
making decisions which they present as decision of the people or
for the country. The promotion of rule of law doesn't hold very
much because the people that have the money, they believe that
they can buy their way through. Unlike the system they have in
the United States where nobody is above the law. But I think that
that can be accomplished in Nigeria when the right leaders come
into power that respect the rule of law and apply that rule of law
to themselves as well.
The laws and rules in the present Nigerian situation are
made to represent special interests and the power that mat-
ters. Most of the time, the laws are enforced only on the
weaker ones and implemented for the common people in the
society. The only application to top politicians and govern-
ment officials is when the image of the high-ranking and
powerful leaders is at stake in the eyes of the public. The law
under the present condition is not comprehensive, and it is
not working well enough to serve the interest of the country
due to lack of implementation and enforcement. Most people
are sometimes afraid of the system of government, because
of insecurity, chaos, and lack of rule of law. As the partici-
pants affirmed, there are rules and a constitution that are only
on paper and for decoration (Figure 2).
Conclusion
The overall conclusion that emerged from the research can
be summarized in the views of Sally Hargreaves (2002) who
claimed that Nigeria, once heralded as the beacon of Africa,
has fallen somewhat short of this potential. Years of pluto-
cratic repressive dictators and military rule, coupled with
widespread corruption, have resulted in large-scale neglect
and deterioration of public services. The upsurge of corrup-
tion in Nigeria is endemic and troubling. Transparency
International consistently rates the levels of corruption in
Nigeria among the highest in the world. Pervasive corruption
appears to permeate many levels of the Nigerian society (Eti
et al., 2006).
12 SAGE Open
All the participants agreed that the national resources
endowed to them by nature are being wasted or misappropri-
ated to private pockets. Good roads and schools are missing;
the hospitals are not equipped; the transport system is not
working or available in most of the cities. If Nigerians spent
their wealth as appropriate, they would not be complaining.
The masses would at least have good schools, good roads,
good drinking water, electricity, and health facilities, but the
reality is that these are seriously lacking. A nation that has oil
is still begging money to handle health issues and having
problems acquiring technology. There is need for awareness
in the governance and leadership of the country, so that the
people and the society can embrace procedures in accor-
dance with the dictates of the rule of law.
Recommendations for
Elected Leaders and Policy Makers
1. Maintain the rule of law as top priority of any elected
leader in Nigeria from the federal to the local govern-
ment level.
2. Establish collective effort in decision making in
which every part is duly represented and mutually
beneficial decisions are made. Any leader that
emerges to lead Nigeria must be totally de-tribalized.
All decisions must be made bearing one Nigeria in
mind and be completely unbiased, filled with objec-
tivity and free of sentiments. Nigeria is made up of
different tribes, cultures and religions; no one tribe or
religion should be marginalized.
3. Divide the nation into three different sovereign
regions, namely, the Hausa, Igbo, andYoruba regions.
Nigerians need leadership that harmonizes and main-
tains the geopolitical systems.
4. Develop a decision-making process that starts from
the community, involves the people, and represents
the interest of the general public.
5. Encourage the understanding of the people's culture
and history in the country.
6. Nigerian leaders should be able to understand the
diversity tribes, tradition, customs, and languages of
the different people in Nigeria to enhance a better and
comprehensive leadership style and effectiveness in
governance of the people.
