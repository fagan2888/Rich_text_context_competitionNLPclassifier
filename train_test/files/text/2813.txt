Abstract
We test the hypothesis that prehistoric Native American land use influenced the Euro-Amer-
ican settlement process in a South Carolina Piedmont landscape. Long term ecological
studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and trajectories in complex,
coupled social and ecological systems. Native American land use likely altered the ecologi-
cal and evolutionary feedback and trajectories of many North American landscapes. Yet,
considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of land use legacies of prehistoric
Native Americans. At the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European col-
onists settled a mostly "wild" landscape or an already "humanized" landscape. We use sta-
tistical event analysis to model the effects of prehistoric Native American settlement on the
rate of Colonial land grants (1749­1775). Our results reveal how abandoned Native Ameri-
can settlements were among the first areas claimed and homesteaded by Euro-Americans.
We suggest that prehistoric land use legacies served as key focal nodes in the Colonial era
settlement process. As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped
structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted
from Euro-American settlement.
Introduction
The process of Euro-American settlement of the South Carolina Piedmont, and elsewhere,
established historically and spatially contingent land-use patterns that continue to influence
the trajectories of social-ecological landscapes [1­4]. Ecological legacies from post-settlement
land-use in Eastern North America are documented at the plot [1­4] and regional levels [5­7].
Settlers did not randomly scatter across the landscape, but rather, conditioned their choices to
a set of criteria that reflected the demands of contemporary cultural, economic and agricultural
systems. The land these settlers encountered was not pristine untouched wilderness, but a
landscape that was shaped and modified by Native American populations for thousands of
years [8]. In this paper, we argue that the settlement patterns and persistent legacies of the
Euro-Americans were themselves conditioned by the land use legacies of the Native Americans
that preceded them. To explain the significance of this patterning, we draw on the concept of
ecological inheritance from niche construction theory [9].

Long term ecological studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and tra-
jectories in complex, coupled social and ecological systems [7, 10­13]. In Europe, where inten-
sive agricultural land use has been practiced for millennia, the ubiquity of land use legacies is
well established [14­17]. On a much smaller scale, ecologically significant land use legacies
have been detected in South America [18­20] and in Mexico and Central America [21, 22].
Native American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajecto-
ries of many North American landscapes [8, 23­27]. Paleoecological and coincident archaeo-
logical data from some locations support this argument [28­31].
However, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of the land use legacies
of prehistoric Native Americans. Some scholars argue that the ecological legacy effects of past
Native American land use were significant and nearly ubiquitous [26, 32]. Others maintain
that the effects were highly localized and therefore insignificant at broader scales [33­36]. At
the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly
"wild" landscape or an already "humanized" landscape. Progress in eastern North America has
focused on resolving issues of pattern and scale of prehistoric and historical Native American
land use. This work suggests that localized patches of anthropogenic disturbance were embed-
ded in a broader, heterogeneous landscape matrix [37, 38]. As a consequence, the vast majority
of the prehistoric North American landscape was dominated by natural rather than anthropo-
genic forces. Even so, at any scale, empirical analyses of material legacies of past Native Ameri-
can land use in contemporary socioecological systems remains relatively limited [6, 39­41].
Here, we test the hypothesis that cumulative, environmental legacies of Native American
land use influenced the location and timing of Euro-American settlement events for individual
parcels of land in the landscape surrounding the confluences of the Broad, Enoree, and Tyger
Rivers of South Carolina. We use an event-history analysis [42, 43] to statistically model spatial
and temporal associations between archaeological evidence of prehistoric Native American
land use and Colonial Euro-American settlement processes in the Southern Piedmont Physio-
graphic Region of eastern North America. Historical narratives suggest that Native American
agricultural legacies (successional old fields, floodplain canebrakes, semi-cultivated nut and
fruit bearing trees) were important in the Euro-American settlement process [44, 45]. Given
widespread acknowledgement of localized effects of prehistoric land use surrounding settle-
ments [34, 38], we take archaeological evidence of Native American occupation as a proxy for
the potential occurrence of prehistoric land use legacies. Such assumptions about land use
(and their legacies) are also consistent with archaeological theory in central place foraging and
settlement ecology which posits that land use intensity declines as the distance from residence
and work sites increase [46­48]. Thus, legacies in soils and vegetation type and cover were
most likely located in the immediate proximity of the residential and food processing sites evi-
denced by archaeological material.
Our results demonstrate the degree to which prehistoric archaeological sites served as key
focal nodes in the Colonial era settlement process, thus tying emergent Euro-American land
use and ownership patterns to land use legacies of prehistoric Native American farmers. We
argue that our findings support the idea that for the South Carolina Piedmont, localized pre-
historic land use in the immediate area surrounding prehistoric archaeological sites engen-
dered long term ecological legacies that served as settlement opportunities for colonial Euro-
Americans. These initial anchor points then structured subsequent settlement patterns from
which contemporary regional-scale land use legacies derive. Thus, past cultural occupations
can present subtle but persistent ecological opportunities and constraints in socioecological
systems that influence the settlement ecology of successive occupations.

Study area
Our project area is located at the on-going NSF funded research at the Calhoun Critical Zone
Observatory (CZO), a collaborative, broadly interdisciplinary research group focused on the
long term effects of historical land use on hydrology, geomorphology, biology, and biogeo-
chemistry of the South Carolina Piedmont. Our project area, within the Enoree District of the
Sumter National Forest, encompasses a 1256 km2 landscape incorporating portions of the
Tyger, Enoree, and Broad River watersheds (Fig 1). The climate is classified as humid, subtrop-
ical with approximately 1250 mm of precipitation annually, hot summers and mild winters,
with temperatures ranging approximately -5 to 40°C [10]. The vegetation cover is dominated
by mesic second growth hardwoods in bottomlands, and secondary pine and mixed oak-pine
forests on side slopes and uplands, nearly of which is reforestation of former agricultural
lands. Soils are characterized by acidic, highly weathered Ultisols on the upland interfluves
and more fertile soils occurring on alluvial bottomlands [10]. Uplands are highly eroded and
the bottomlands are aggraded with a meter or more of sedimentation, as a result of linked pro-
cesses triggered by 19th and early 20th century plantation agriculture.
Native American settlement and niche construction. Southeastern prehistoric archaeol-
ogy is divided into four periods: Paleoindian ca. 14,000­10,000 BP (Before 1950), Archaic ca.
10,000­2,700 BP, Woodland ca. 2,700­1,000 BP, and Mississippian ca. 1,000­300 BP [49, 50].
The earliest evidence of human occupation and use of the project area begins with distinctive

lithic material attributed to Paleoindian phase, at least 10,000 BP [50]. Early populations fol-
lowed a land-extensive hunter-gatherer mode of subsistence. Any environmental legacies from
this period, real or potential, are not well understood, though the depletion of Pleistocene
mega-fauna through overhunting has been hypothesized [51­53].
The Archaic period is marked by a diversification in lithic technologies, including preva-
lence of grind stones, the presence of hearths and storage pits, signs of demographic growth,
and, late in the period, the development of pyro-ceramic technologies, and the exploitation of
cultigens [49]. By the late Archaic (ca. 5000­3400 BP), foraging groups began to cultivate
domesticates in upland and riverine settings [54]. On the Southern Piedmont, agricultural
land use probably began later, either during or after the middle Woodland period [50]. Groups
were farming bottomland floodplains by the late Woodland and this activity intensified with
the cultivation of Zea mays (maize) during the Mississippian period [50].
For many years the transition from hunter-gatherer to intensive agricultural production
systems was understood as a culmination of reactive, one-way adaptations to changing
resource and demographic conditions [55]. Niche construction theory, argues instead that
intensification and the increasing diversity of subsistence resources resulted from proactive
adaptation in places already productive [24, 56]. The theory posits that positive feedbacks
between land use and environment can increase the reliability of targeted plant and animal
resources. Through the management and manipulation of plants, animals, and land forms,
this type of ecological engineering confers increasing returns over time as the outcomes of past
activities accumulate to form new, and more desirable environmental conditions. Niche con-
struction is the reciprocal reinforcement of ecological engineering through social and cultural
changes that respond to the modified environment, including the emergence of livelihood-
centered value systems, localized traditional ecological knowledge, and specialized cognitive
understanding of resource distribution across time and space, all of which confer adaptive
advantages [57, 58]. Thus human niche construction proposes that human evolution is subject
to genetic, cultural, and ecological inheritance [9].
Smith [54, 59­61] laid out a detailed, empirical account for the role of niche construction in
the co-evolution of Native American society and plant and landscape domestication in parts of
the Eastern Woodlands of North American. His argument suggests that the development of
agricultural societies relied on a long term dynamic process by which Native American land
use "domesticated" the landscape thereby making it more conducive to agricultural land use
and its complimentary settlement arrangements [24, 59]. The process of domestication
involved the localized restructuring of plant communities in ways that removed undesirably
vegetation, transplanted or spread the seeds of economically desirable plants, and conserved
and cultivated nut- and fruit-bearing tree species [24]. As a result of these multi-generational
efforts, Native American settlements became specific focal points for the concentration of eco-
nomically valuable plant species, were strategically located in reference to managed game and
fish habitats, and were structurally "engineered" to accommodate agricultural endeavors. The
attractiveness of this ecological inheritance ensured that many settlements were occupied over
multiple generations.
Native American abandonment and Euro-American settlement history. The exact
period of Native American abandonment of domestic sites in the project area is unknown.
Larger, intensively used bottomland settlements may have been abandoned as early as 500 BP.
Three radiocarbon dates place occupation of major Mississippian sites in the project area
between 1018­1634 calibrated CE (Oxcal 99.7% CI, dates from Green and Bates [62]). Desoto's
entrada (ca. 1539­1543 CE) bypassed the project area, looping around it on the southeast and
north, so early historical evidence for its occupation remains elusive [63]. By the 17th and early

18th century, Cherokee most certainly used the area for hunting and gathering forays, but
perennial occupation of the area remains unknown.
During the late 17th and early 18th century, Euro-American traders, slave raiders, hunters,
and itinerant cattle herders penetrated the interior of the South Carolina "backcountry". The
vicissitudes of the colonial economy and intermittent conflicts with the Cherokee and other
Native American groups rendered their presence ephemeral. Although African-Americans
certainly played an important role in South Carolina during both the Colonial and Ante-Bel-
lum periods, for a variety of reasons, their presence in the backcountry was insignificant until
the 1790s [64].
Early settlement in South Carolina focused on the coast and settlement in the Piedmont
backcountry did not begin in earnest until the 1730s following a survey and map by George
Hunter [65]. Soon afterward, townships were laid out that served as support bases for the set-
tlement of the backcountry [65, 66]. Settlement was slowed due to numerous conflicts with
Native Americans. Eventually, a 1747 treaty with the Cherokee and a garrisoned fort at the
confluence of the Broad and Congaree Rivers opened up the Broad, Enoree, and Tyger River
watersheds for settlement [66, 67].
Formalized legal agrarian settlement in British controlled portions of North America
involved the institution of the "headright grant", a process that transferred title of a specific
parcel of land (the "land grant") from the state to the individual [68]. During the colonial
period in South Carolina (1663­1775), headrights were granted by the King of Great Britain.
The first land grants for the watersheds included in this analysis were recorded in 1749. Grants
ceased during the American War of Independence (1775­1783), but in 1784 the new State of
South Carolina began to issue grants under the authority of the Governor. To receive a land
grant, the settler obtained a warrant from the governor for a certain number of acres at a price
of one half penny sterling silver per acre. Following this, the surveyor general measured and
platted a tract of unclaimed land using the metes and bounds system [68, 69]. In contrast to
the grid systems employed in the 19th century settlement of the western United States, the ear-
lier metes and bounds surveys fixed boundaries of tracts of various sizes and shapes based on
compass bearings and the "Gunter chain" (1 chain = 20.1 meters) measure of distance. Early
tracts, surrounded by vacant land, were located based on their relative proximity to named riv-
ers and creeks. Later, where grants had already been made, their shape and location was indi-
cated based on the cardinal direction by which they were "bounded" by neighboring lands
(e.g. . . . bounded on the Northeast by Smith, on the Southwest by Johnson, etc.).
The land grant record shows an initial trickle of settlers from South Carolina and abroad.
Settlement began to intensify with an influx of Scotch-Irish refugees from Pennsylvania and
Virginia following the 1755 defeat of General Braddock at the hands of the French and Native
forces [70]. Conflicts with Native Americans continued into the 1760s but by the mid-1770s
the settlement "frontier" had moved west [71, 72]. However, land grants continued to be issued
in the study area through 1851, filling in unclaimed land and reallocating tracts lacking clean
chains of title.
Material and methods
To test whether prehistoric Native American land use affected spatiotemporal patterns of
Euro-American settlement we choose a Cox proportional hazard model (Cox model) [73].
Cox models have been successfully employed in similar types of event analyses [74, 75] and
perform well with continuous and categorical (binary "dummy") variables [43]. Event analysis
examines the cumulative timing of a change in qualitative state. We represent settlement
"events" as the date of first Euro-American claim to a specific parcel of land, evidenced by

maps and legal descriptions for surveyed land grants. The analysis accounts for time such that
rates of claims to land (by year), can be assessed with reference to fixed-time covariates repre-
senting the physical characteristics of the parcel of land being claimed.
Analysis relied on three main sources of data: (1) historical land grant survey maps with
associated grant dates, (2) archaeological survey and site locations with relative dates of occu-
pation; and (3) a 10m2 digital elevation model (DEM) from the USGS. We used a GIS geodata-
base to organize and sample these data for our statistical analysis of the timing of settlement
events. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata 11.2.
Land grant and settlement geodatabase
The GIS land grant geodatabase was primarily derived the United States Forest Service (USFS)
land purchase records for the Sumter National Forest created in the 1930s. The National Forest
land purchase was well documented and consists of survey maps and legal descriptions stretch-
ing back to the original land grants. We cross-checked the USFS data with a local heritage atlas
of land grant plats and other historical points of interest created by the Union County Histori-
cal Society in the 1970s [76]. For each tract of land purchased during the 1930s and 1940s, the
USFS made a thorough effort to trace property ownership and legal bounding from its initial
granting to the time of public purchase. The resulting dossiers for each tract of land included
maps with surveyed property boundaries overlaid on the original survey plats associated with
the land grants. The maps were produced for the Forest Service by professional surveyors and
were accompanied by documentation for the chain of ownership beginning with the land
grant text itself. Where USFS records did not provide data (approximately 13% of the study
area), we used the Union County Historical Society Atlas.
Where grants overlapped (e.g. a grant in 1765 incorporated into a 1784 grant), we digitized
first record. In other words, where the area of a land grant was previously deeded, the surface
area of the grant is only represented in the map where portion of the tract was not previously
claimed. Our completed dataset includes 1,160 land grants each with year of survey, acreage
granted, and the name of the grantee (Fig 2). Grants were distributed between 1749 through
1851. We divide this range into two settlement periods, which demonstrate distinct character-
istic. The first ranges from 1749 to the onset of the war in 1775, and the second begins with the
end of the war in 1784 through 1851, when the last grant was assigned (Fig 3).
We anticipated that the location of each land grant could influence the timing of successive
neighboring settlement. To explore the spatial pattern and timing of settlement parcels with
reference to their neighbors, we calculated the average number of years between a grant and its
neighboring grants. When plotted by year of grant, the average number of years between a
grant and its neighbors decreases for the initial settlement period. When granting resumed in
1784, the trend shows the inverse: increasing difference in years between a grant and its neigh-
bors. These trends show statistically significant and correlatively robust linear associations (Fig
4). This patterning may indicate that the first division of the land sensu [77] was characterized
by dispersed settlement. If settlers showed a preference for dispersion over clustering, we
would expect to see higher average difference in years for earlier settlement and lower differ-
ence in years for later settlement. To account for these preferences in our event history model,
we added a parameter of the average difference in years between a grant and its neighbors.
Settlement forts. Fortifications against attacks by French and Native Americans were cru-
cial all along the 18th century Anglo -dominated settlement frontier [72]. In the South Carolina
"backcountry", inland of the Piedmont-Coastal Plain fall-line, domestic defense took the shape
of settler "forts", private homesteads fortified with stockades or palisades, abatis (a row of trees
with sharpened tops), and Garrison blockhouses with gun portals and cantilevered overhangs

[65, 78]. Indeed, settlers along the Enoree, Tyger, and Broad Rivers relied heavily on settler
forts during the years 1760­61, the height of the Anglo-Cherokee War (part of the global con-
flict known as the Seven Years' War) [66]. Further, in the years following these conflicts, law-
lessness and chaos persisted in the South Carolina backcountry [67]. This history suggests
the real possibility that concerns for safety and security influenced the settlement pattern and
process. Consequently, we included travel cost-distance to settler forts as a covariate in our
Fig 2. Land grant dataset and distribution within the project area.

statistical model of settlement events. We used a combination of historical narratives, land
grants, and archaeological site records to locate 11 forts dating from at least 1760­61 (the
Anglo-Cherokee War period) (Table 1.). We then conducted a cost-distance analysis using the
slope-weighted least-cost pathway between a land grant center point and the nearest settler
fort (Fig 5).
Physiographic covariates. Physiographic factors such as topography and distribution of
landforms exert important controls on land use and land use change [79­81]. We tested a total
of 12 different physiographic factors. Quantitative and qualitative physiographic variables
were derived from a USGS 10m digital elevation model (DEM) using the standard ArcGIS
Spatial Analyst toolbox, the Geomorphology and Gradient Metrics toolbox, and Topography
Tools (Table 2). Although the elevation range in our project area is relatively narrow (28­242
masl) we nevertheless included it since elevations are lowest toward the southeastern portion
of the landscape and highest in the northwestern portion. Thus, we hypothesized that the effect
of elevation on settlement would be indicative of the rate of settlement dispersal throughout
the area. We included percent slope since we hypothesized that the flattest areas would be the
most desirable and therefore settled first. We were interested in slope-aspect since settlers

could choose south and east-facing slopes for agricultural purposes or north and west facing
slopes for shelter from extreme weather such as hurricanes.
We also tested topographic and distance indices. The topographically derived solar radia-
tion index and topographic wetness index capture factors important for agriculture: potential
availability of sunlight and soil moisture. For example, Jones and Ellis [82] found that in com-
parison to other locations, long term prehistoric settlements in North Carolina had higher
solar radiation values and well-drained soils. The site exposure index accounts for the possible
preference for shelter from weather or visibility relating to site defensibility. The "distance to
river" variable, calculated as the distance to the highest order drainages, permits analysis of the
relative importance of the rivers to settlement. In addition to provisioning water, energy, and

biological resources, river corridors connected the settlers to the coastal plain via water trans-
port. Further, river crossings were strategic nodes along the important trade routes traversing
the regions. Lastly, we included three binary variables representing the dominant landforms
on the landscape: wide floodplain bottomlands, narrow valleys, and upland ridgetops, to assess
whether settlers had preferences for particular landforms. The topographic position index
(TPI) discriminates landforms based on the topography of a sample area's neighborhood. We
reclassified and simplified the TPI into three binary variables representing presence and
absence of each landform.
Archaeological sites and pedestrian survey data. Archaeological survey, site locations
(ArcGIS shapefile polygons) and reports for the area were downloaded from the South Carolina
Site Files website (http://www.scarchsite.org). We relied on field assessments for determination
of archaeological phase. For the analysis, we sorted the sites into four relatively dated, mutually
exclusive categories (Table 3): (1) Long term prehistoric agricultural phase sites (ArchLong-
Term) represented by sites with a Mississippian phase and a Woodland Component; (2) Late
prehistoric agricultural sites (ArchMiss) represented by sites with a Mississippian phase compo-
nent only; (3) Non-Mississippian prehistoric site (ArchNoMiss) represented by relative dated
prehistoric sites with no Mississippian component; (4) Prehistoric sites of undetermined phase
(s) (ArchUnknown) represented by lithic scatters with no temporally diagnostic artifacts.
According to surface survey and systematic shovel testing, artifact densities at most sites were rel-
atively low and relative dating was often based on 1 or 2 ceramics or projectile point styles. Con-
sequently, our typology is based on presence of diagnostic artifacts rather than their density.
Sampling. Individual archaeological sites in Sumter National Forest average about 4,800
m2 (standard deviation of 11,700 m2). Land grants, on the other hand, average 970,000 m2
(standard deviation of 866,000 km2). To reconcile differences in scalar resolution of our data
and to adjust for any spatial biases resulting from spatial pattern and scalar-mismatch, we cre-
ated an arbitrary grid of 100 x 100 m (1 ha) sample units represented in the geodatabase by a
topology of polygons.
We limited our sample to units with a known land grant date that intersected areas system-
atically surveyed for archaeological artifacts and features (survey areas and recorded archaeo-
logical sites) (Fig 6). Other spatial studies of settlement have employed random sampling to
control for the potential autocorrelation of archaeological sites with environmental attributes
[82, 84]. However, since the presence or absence of archaeological evidence remains uncertain
for areas that have not been systematically surveyed, we were concerned that random sampling

could introduce errors. To eliminate this potentially confounding source of uncertainty, we
sampled all systematically surveyed areas within the boundaries of our land grant coverage.
Additionally, a large percentage of our sample area has undergone systematic subsurface
archaeological shovel testing, thus improving our confidence in the accuracy of presence of
archaeological material, its spatial boundaries, and the cultural period determination based on
established chronological typologies of artifacts [50]. We extracted the physiographic and set-
tler fort cost-distance covariates by calculating their mean value for each 100m2 sample unit.
We created binary dummy variables for each of the four pre-historic land use categories to

represent their presence (1) or absence (0) within the unit. Based on this sampling criteria,
about 28% of our sample units show presence of archaeological material while the remainder
is surveyed area lacking observed archaeological evidence.
Cox proportional hazards model
In the Cox model, each sample unit is a uniquely identified case with records for each year of
its "survival" up through its "failure" event [42, 43, 73]. Thus, time is represented on an annual
resolution with the year of the first grant in our study area (1749) is represent as time 1 (t1
)
while the year of the last grant (1775) is represented as time 27 (t27
). We use the year of the
land grant (ti
) as the time of Euro-settlement event. As our 100 m2 sample units are claimed by
the settlement event, they "fail" and exit the analysis.
The Cox proportional hazards model is expressed as:
Log h
i
ðtÞ ¼ a ðtÞ þ b

x
i1
þ Á Á Á þ b

Where a (t) is the survival time, and 1
through k
are the coefficients for x1

covariates.
In our results, we report the proportional effects of each covariate on the rate of event occur-
rence as a hazard ratio. The Hazard ratio can be interpreted as the percent change in event rate

(e.g. 0.95­1.25), this indicates the possibilities of negative, positive, or no effects.
Although we were only interested in the initial settlement period or first division of the
land (1749 to 1775), we nevertheless modeled grants the period from 1784 to 1851 so that we
could compare any differences in settlement preferences. To do this, we grouped the samples
into two periods: period 1 samples with grants issued during the colonial era spanning from
1749 to 1775 and period 2 samples with grants issued from 1784 to 1851. We modeled each
period separately and report the respective results below. We ran multiple iterations of the
model and variously culled predictor covariates that were insignificant. The data used in the
model is available in the supporting information files (S1 Table).

(Table 4.). Sample units with long term or recurrent prehistoric agricultural period occupa-
tions showed the strongest statistically significant effect with a 243% increase in rate of Euro-
American settlement in comparison to units without such sites. Settlement showed similar
increased rates for wide flood plains at 214% and areas within 100 m of the widest floodplains
(29%). Units with Mississippian sites lacking a recorded Woodland component showed a 69%
increased settlement rate. Finally, non-Mississippian sites showed a 50% increase and non-
diagnostic lithic scatters showed a 28% increase in settlement rate. A one unit increase in TWI
provided a 11% increase in settlement rate, showing the influence of wetter, bottomland soils.
The average difference in years between neighboring grants was also slightly positive with a
3% increased rate.
Site exposure was a negative influence with a 10% decrease in settlement rate. Elevation
showed a slight negative effect with 0.8% decreased settlement rate. The influence of the cost-
distance to settler forts was also negative, indicating a preference to locate closer to these forts,
however, the hazard ratio value was negligible at less than 0.001. Similarly, the hazard ratios
for distance to rivers and for solar radiation were also negligible.
Period 2: 1784­1851
The greatest significant and positive influence on land grant location and timing for period 2
was the 100 m proximity to wide floodplains (hazard ratio of 1.465). Wide floodplains

themselves were dropped out of the model as they were not significant. Following this, the
non-Mississippian sites and non-diagnostic lithic scatters showed relatively weak positive
influences with a 15% and 10% increased rate respectively. Land grants were negatively influ-
enced by site exposure (5% decrease in settlement rate). In contrast to period 1, the average
number of years between a grant and its neighbors had a negative effect (6% decrease in rate
for every 1 year increase). Thus, period 2 grants were more clustered in space and time than
the proceeding period. Elevation also continued to exert a weak, but negative influence on set-
tlement rate (1% decrease). Distance to rivers and cost-distance to settler forts were both posi-
tive, but negligible in hazard ratio value.
Discussion
The Settlement process
Our analysis demonstrates that the earliest Euro-American settlers had a clear preference for
sites with a long Native American occupation history located on wide floodplains. Research
suggests that late prehistoric agricultural people in Eastern North America were attracted to
ecologically productive areas [82, 84]. A parsimonious explanation for the observed relation-
ships between prehistoric Native American and Euro-American settlement is that for each
phase of settlement, people selected the most productive areas from the ecological template.
However, as our analysis shows, Euro-American settlers were not uniformly attracted to Mis-
sissippian period sites, they were more attracted to the sites with the longest and most intensive
histories of use. Critically, these qualities are more significant than the environmental covari-
ates hypothesized as important. As other studies have highlighted, Mississippian communities
did not select their settlement locations based on environmental factors alone [84]. Indeed,
whereas settlers showed a preference for proximity to wide flood plains in both periods exam-
ined, by the second period, prehistoric Native American agriculture sites were unimportant or
were already claimed.
Settlers clearly valued agriculturally productive fields and grazing commons over proximity
to neighbors or defensive fortifications. Despite the dangers apparent on the South Carolina
Piedmont frontier, settlers followed a dispersed pattern. If the Piedmont had been predomi-
nantly "wild", settlers would have been smart to aggregate around particular toeholds as they
domesticated the landscape. Instead, they were able to spread out, giving priority to sites previ-
ously occupied by Native Americans.
As settlement density increased, settlement inevitably clustered and differences in years
between neighboring land grants declined. These results thus confirm earlier observations that
the frontier had moved farther west by 1775, likely leaving only land of the lowest agricultural
value as common property. After 1784, land grants were constrained by the previous wave of
settlement, with colonists selecting the lower value lands passed over in the first division. As
has been shown for other areas in Eastern North America, later grants were "infilling" the
landscape, as land owners began claiming the lower value, odd shaped parcels left behind by
their predecessors [4]. Indeed, the land grant period 2 (post 1784) covariates show consider-
ably diminished strength and significance in comparison to those of period 1. Rather than a
second wave of settlement, the post-Revolutionary War second division grants probably repre-
sented efforts by existing residents to claim commons adjacent to previously improved lands.
Numerous legacies of Native American land use were observed historically in the South-
eastern Piedmont, some of which are still in evidence today. These include extensive trail net-
works, previously cleared agricultural fields ("Indian old fields") [66], fruit and nut tree
occurrence [40, 41, 85], and fish weirs [71]. We hypothesized that these behaviors resulted in
an unevenly distributed set of ecological conditions that were later conducive to the Euro-

American modes of production at the time. If our hypothesis is true, settler preferences for
these sites resulted in spatial patterns partly pre-determined by past Native American land use
decisions. We therefore argue that Native American land use legacies laid the foundation for a
landscape architecture that funneled settlers to key locations that became the focal nodes for
the dispersed settlement strategy followed during the Colonial era (period 1). These initial set-
tlement patterns then operated as historically contingent spatial constraints on the land grants
that followed the Revolutionary War (period 2). Based on historical observations discussed
below, we speculate that expediency and enhanced productivity were the two most important
reasons Euro-Americans gravitated to areas characterized by Native American legacies.
Expediency and "Indian old fields"
If optimal use of land involves maximizing productivity while balancing the ability to defend
yields, land use decisions that eschew optimality and security in the face of labor costs or time
constraints can be considered "expedient". Agricultural settlement often requires expediency
over optimality since time and labor are both limited during the construction the agricultural
niche. Yet, as noted above, Euro-American settlement era landscapes of Eastern North Ameri-
can were hardly pristine. These landscapes had seen a form of agricultural niche construction
before: historical maps and place names suggest that "Indian old fields" (abandoned cultigen
fields) were fairly common landscape features [86­88]. Indeed, old fields are often mentioned
in historical narratives as attracting early Euro-American settlement since these were easiest to
clear and plant [44, 66, 89, 90].
Even though our study area may have been agriculturally abandoned by Native Americans
perhaps as much as a century prior to the arrival of Euro-American settlers [50], the Cherokee,
Catawbas, Euro-American hunters, trappers, and cattle herders continued to maintain an
anthropogenic influence on the landscape [66, 67, 71, 91]. Mississippian trails and old fields
likely provided a relatively low maintenance landscape infrastructure for the itinerant hunters
and trappers. The seventeenth and eighteenth century deerskin trade between Native- and
Euro-Americans had wide ranging social and environmental significance [44]. By 1750, the
lower Cherokee villages were at least 100 km to the west of the project area, however Cherokee
hunters exploited considerable geographical area beyond the immediate confines of their vil-
lage territories [92]. They transported the deerskins to Charleston, likely traversing the Sumter
National Forest area. Many Native American groups have been documented using fire to drive
game [25, 93] and paleoecological evidence for increased fire activity in the early to mid-1700s
has been attributed to the Southeastern deerskin trade [94]. Intentional and casual use of fire
for hunting and to clear trails and campsites could have easily maintained patches and corri-
dors of open landscape [95]. Historical geographer Prunty [96] (p165) hypothesized that
"maintenance of open woodlands, via recurrent fires, and of old clearings `inherited' from the
Indians, was vital," to the ephemeral cattle herding economy that preceded the agrarian settle-
ment frontier. This fire maintenance hypothesis is also consistent with historical period
descriptions of the settlement period landscape which characterized the Piedmont as extensive
woodland savannah and prairie ridges divided by vast brakes of cane [91].
Productivity and the canebrake
Cane (Arundinaria gigantea (Walter) Muhl.), a species of native bamboo, typically grows in
extremely dense, monodominant stands called canebrakes that were a common feature of the
settlement era bottomlands [45, 90, 91]. Canebrakes tend to grow on alluvial terraces as they
tolerate moderate flooding. They are an early successional species, maintained by regular (~10
year) cycles of fire, and die out under conditions of fire exclusion or overgrazing [45, 97].

Historical narratives frequently noted the importance of canebrakes to the settlement process
[66, 71, 91]. The livestock-dominant subsistence strategies of Euro-American settlers benefit-
ted from A. giganteana because it is a highly productive forage crop and retains its nutritional
value during the winter season when native grasses are dormant [90]. Settlers apparently
judged the fertility of a site by the height of its cane (up to 12-14m tall) [91]. Indeed, A. gigan-
teana does attain its greatest height in the most fertile soils [97].
A. giganteana was also extremely important to Native Americans, frequently appearing in
regional ethnobotanical records of the Late Woodland period [98]. Canebrakes were likely
propagated and managed as an integral component of late prehistoric Native American agro-
ecology [45, 99]. The economic utility of A. giganteana makes it a good candidate for fallowing
nutrient exhausted fields and for occupying less productive field edges and corners. Not only
did A. giganteana provide material for basket-making and the construction of shelters, it likely
played an important soil-amending role in the shifting agricultural systems employed by late
Woodland and Mississppian peoples [90]. Periodic flooding in bottomlands deposits soil sedi-
ment that helped maintain the fertility in the prehistoric shifting agricultural system [87, 97].
Since A. giganteana grows in dense thickets, these can slow floodwaters, thus capturing more
sediment than a typical stand of bottomland hardwood trees. When an old field was again
needed for agriculture the cane could be harvested for use. If cane stems and slash were then
burned, the residual charcoal and potash would provide additional nutrients to the soils. Over
the centuries, cycles of maize cultivation and cane-fallowing might have improved rather than
degraded the bottomland soils. Indeed, Ethridge [90] posits that invasive A. giganteana may
have been a more important factor than nutrient exhaustion in prompting Native American
riverine farmers to abandon and rotate fields. Occasionally clearing canebreaks for new fields
would have been less labor intensive than hoeing and picking annually worsening A. gigan-
teana invasions.
Numerous historical sources mention canebrakes growing in Native American old fields
[45, 90, 99]. It seems likely that the vast and fertile canebrakes encountered by Euro-American
settlers were, at least in part, the product of centuries of a Native American agroecology that
served to use and maintain the productivity of fields and soils. Thus, Euro-American settlers
were attracted to these long occupied bottomland "nodes", in part, because of their improved
productivity and ease of conversion over similar sites with no Native American occupation
history.
Native American legacies and persistence in landscape architecture
Based on our results, we hypothesize that the ecological legacies of Native Americans served as
attractants and focal points of Euro-American settlement, and that these localized legacies
helped to structure landscape-scale patterns of land use and boundaries that persist to the pres-
ent. Using spatial overlay methods, we estimate that at least 15% of the contemporary bound-
ary of the Sumter National Forest is composed of legacy property lines dating from the land
grant surveys. Overlying the original property boundaries of tracts assembled into the National
Forest starting in the 1930s, coincident boundaries between properties and land grants are
even more prevalent. This is significant, because different land uses between pre-National For-
est property owners often followed arbitrary property boundaries rather than natural land-
scape features [100]. Thus, a percentage of the contemporary distribution of land cover, e.g.
between forest stand type and ages, can be attributed to original land grant boundaries. This
effectively means that the hypothesized Euro-American settlement preferences for legacies of
prehistoric Native American niche construction could have had a subtle but persistent effect
on the structure of our contemporary landscape.

Conclusions
We empirically demonstrate tangible historical links between millennial prehistoric Native
American land use and the Euro-American settlement process for the Sumter National Forest
in the South Carolina Piedmont. Although we cannot assert that Native American land use leg-
acies directly caused the settlement location choices of Euro-Americans, the earliest Euro-
Americans to settle the South Carolina Piedmont exhibited a preference for long term and late
prehistoric Native American occupation sites above environmental characteristics including
topographic position, slope, aspect, soil moisture, and solar radiation. Settlers were attracted to
wide floodplains dominated by canebrakes (A. giganteana) that were most likely a legacy of
Native American land use practices. We hypothesize that Euro-Americans were attracted to
prehistoric Native American sites because they included land that was easier for travel, expedi-
ent to clear and plant, and because they were more productive. We attribute these qualities to
localized ecological engineering activities of prehistoric Native Americans. Native Americans
did not simply settle the most resource-rich environments, they altered them to suit agricul-
tural land use; a process that took them multiple generations. Euro-Americans relying on
maize and cattle took advantage of these previously engineered environments and were able to
more quickly establish their agrarian economy.
Other examples highlighting the coevolution of landscape and society focus on places with
demographic, if not cultural, continuity [14, 101]. Here, we suggest that the ecological legacies
of Native Americans were significant and were generalized enough to confer an advantage to a
demographically and culturally unrelated population of Euro-American settlers. If our inter-
pretation is correct, this finding identifies a process whereby localized environmental modifi-
cations of prehistoric Native American populations indirectly contributed to large scale,
contemporary landscape- and regional-level ecological inheritances. Significantly, it also dis-
pels the notion of a wilderness frontier and suggests that the "humanized" portions of the land-
scape may have been crucial to settlement.
Over the last several decades, ecologists have begun to realize the importance of both histor-
ical contingency and past land use for understanding current and future ecological conditions
[10, 102, 103]. At a minimum, our results point to continuity between millennia of Native
American land use and the trajectory of the contemporary Piedmont landscapes. Because
Native American land use may have created an underlying architecture that guided Euro-
American settlement, prehistoric niche construction activities likely continue to influence
household to regional level land use patterns as well as landscape-level resource management
and conservation efforts such as Sumter National Forest. This research on the long term socio-
ecological dynamics of the Calhoun CZO is a first effort to shed light on long term anthropo-
genic factors underlying the soil and hydrological degradation that followed closely on the
heels of Euro-American settlement. Refining the spatial and temporal scope and resolution of
land use history is important for explaining the spatiotemporal heterogeneity inherent in criti-
cal zone processes.
