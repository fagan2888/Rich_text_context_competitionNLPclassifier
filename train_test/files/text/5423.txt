Introduction
The development of an athlete is likened to an art where
coaches are involved in complex orchestration of planning,
executing training, and competition (Nash, Sproule, &
Horton, 2011). Many models have been developed to help
countries, sport clubs, and coaches prepare athletes to reach
their full potential. Bruner, Erickson, Wilson, and Côté
(2010) suggested that athlete development models were cre-
ated with the mind-set of "continuity and developmental
change across athlete developmental stages." Côté, Bruner,
Erickson, Strachan, and Fraser-Thomas (2010) postulated
that the key role of coaches at particular points in athletes'
development is to consider their global developmental
pathway.
Long-Term Athlete Development (LTAD)
In Canada, Balyi and Way (1995) developed the LTAD
model to help enhance performance by internationally com-
petitive Canadian athletes in some sports and slow the declin-
ing rate of physical activity by Canadians (Ifedi, 2005). Since
2005, Sport Canada has promoted the LTAD model to
address this decline and help in the development of elite ath-
letes. Indeed, in its 2007 to 2012 Canadian Sport Policy,
Sport Canada mentioned LTAD as ". . . one of the potentially
most significant advances in Canadian sport since the adop-
tion of Canadian Sport Policy in 2002 . . ." (Canadian
Heritage, 2007, p. 3).
The backbone of LTAD is built on the physiological prin-
ciples of growth, development, and skill acquisition (Bompa,
1995; Ford etal., 2011; Stafford, 2005). Other models of ath-
lete development, such as Côté's Developmental Model of
Sport Participation, share similar principles, like avoidance
of early specialization (Côté, Lidor, & Hackfort, 2009), but
place strong emphasis on psychosocial maturation. For more
information about the 10 factors of LTAD, the reader is
invited to consult the Canadian Sport for Life website (http://
canadiansportforlife.ca/learn-about-canadian-sport-life/ten-
key-factors). LTAD includes seven stages of development:
(a) Active Start (0-6 years old), (b) FUNdamental (6-9 years
old), (c) Learn to Train (8-12 years old), (d) Train to Train
(11-16 years old), (e) Train to Compete (15-23 years old), (f)

Coaches' Adoption and Implementation
of Sport Canada's Long-Term Athlete
Development Model
Charlotte Beaudoin1, Bettina Callary2, and François Trudeau3
Abstract
This work explores the adoption and implementation of Sport Canada's long-term athlete development (LTAD) model by
coaches and tries to understand the barriers to and enablers of these processes. LTAD adoption was studied in 14 coaches
(5 female, 9 male) in seven sports while implementation was assessed among 10 different coaches (2 female, 8 male) from
nine sports. Semistructured interviews ascertained coaches' perceptions of and experiences with the LTAD model in their
coaching practice. Coaches adhered to the global vision and general principles of LTAD. However, several barriers to LTAD
adoption and implementation were identified. A mismatch between the model's long-term and the short-term visions of
results in sport was perceived as deterrent to LTAD adoption and implementation. Coaches involved in early development
sports mentioned a lack of compatibility of LTAD with the demands of their sport. Coaches also perceived complexity in
LTAD athlete's developmental stage determination and the identification of "windows of opportunity" or critical periods.
These barriers should be addressed to complete diffusion of LTAD among Canadian coaches.

The LTAD model was introduced as generic and sport-
specific versions to coaches through coaching education pro-
grams in various countries. In Canada, national sport
organizations, sport clubs, and sport associations developed
sport-specific LTAD models and resources to help already-
certified and new coaches understand the concept. The
National Coaching Certification Program (NCCP) is
Canada's largest contributor to coaches' knowledge of the
model (Banack, Bloom, & Falcao, 2012; Canadian Sport
Centres, 2006). Canada's LTAD model is touted as the path-
way for coaches to develop athletes and increase participa-
tion in physical activity (Canadian Sport for Life, 2011).
Research on LTAD
Despite the intent of Sport Canada and sport organizations in
other countries to use LTAD for athlete development,
research on LTAD appears to be found mainly in nonrefereed
reports (Balyi & Way, 1995) and some research on early ver-
sions of Balyi and Way's LTAD model (Ford etal., 2011).
However, peer-reviewed research on the LTAD model is
scarce (Banack etal., 2012; Black & Holt, 2009; Ford etal.,
2011; Frankish, Beaudoin, & Callary, 2012; Lang & Light,
2010).
Black and Holt (2009), who investigated the perceptions
of coaches and parents on the implementation of a LTAD-
based alpine ski program, found that the model helped
coaches to update their knowledge, use consistent language,
and plan training sessions. However, coaches did not have
many other positive comments about the model, and parents
had little knowledge of it. Banack etal. (2012) evaluated
whether the Canadian NCCP entry-level course (Introduction
to Community Coaching) was teaching cross-country
coaches the basic principles of LTAD. All participants per-
ceived that they were able to identify and integrate key com-
ponents of the model into their coaching practices focused on
young athletes having fun as opposed to worrying about
competition results or talent development. This was consis-
tent with LTAD recommendations for the 6-year-old and
younger age group.
Frankish etal. (2012) investigated how coaches in three
Canadian cross-country ski (xc-ski) clubs perceived attri-
butes of the LTAD model in their decisions to adopt it accord-
ing to Rogers's (2003) theoretical framework. Their results
identified two major trends. First, coaches readily adopted
certain aspects of the model (i.e., late specialization with
youth participating in multiple sports, lifelong involvement
in sport, and following developmental stages set out in the
LTAD model). Second, the characteristics of their club influ-
enced coaches' perceptions and thus their adoption of the
model. LTAD was adapted in the United Kingdom from the
same core model as Canadian LTAD.
Lang and Light (2010) found that swimming coaches in the
United Kingdom had concerns about (a) the negative impact
of overemphasis in the LTAD model on training volume at the
expense of precise techniques, and (b) competition rules in
their sport that appeared to contradict elements of their LTAD.
Furthermore, Lang and Light noted that increasing specializa-
tion in swimming at a younger age was incompatible with the
principles and developmental stage of the LTAD model.
Given the ambitious task of implementing LTAD in
Canadian sport, there is a need to understand the challenge of
LTAD's adoption and implementation by coaches and how
they perceive LTAD within their sport context. LTAD's
adoption and successful implementation depend on coaches
involved in their specific coaching environments. Coaches
are those who apply LTAD principles on the ground.
According to Rogers's (2003) theory, they are agents of
change in relation to the proposed innovation that is LTAD.
It is, therefore, important to understand how they perceive
LTAD and what motivates them to adopt or reject it.
The purpose of this article was to explore how coaches
adopted and implemented Sport Canada's LTAD model and
to understand the barriers and enablers they see in these pro-
cesses. This research could link adoption/implementation of
talent development in general, and the LTAD model in par-
ticular, from the perspective of sport coaches. LTAD has
beenadoptedbyvariouscountries(e.g.,theUnitedKingdom),
and the present study has the potential to be generalized to
other sport systems. However, we must warn readers that
ours is not a study of LTAD efficacy.
Theoretical Framework
Rogers's (2003) Diffusion of Innovations served as a theoreti-
cal framework. Originally designed to understand the diffu-
sion of technological innovations, this theory became useful
in helping to fathom the adoption of social innovations within
a social context. A social innovation can be defined as a new
idea (product, service, or model) developed to fulfill social
needs and supported by the public sector, community groups,
and volunteer organizations from any sector or field (Bacon,
Faizullah, Mulgan, & Woodcraft, 2008). In some instances, it
has been employed in health education and exercise program
evaluation (Westhoff & Hopman-Rock, 2002), sport manage-
ment (Newell & Swan, 1995), and sport equipment use
(Schreier, Oberhauser, & Prügl, 2007) to explain and under-
stand the process of innovation adoption in specific domains.
This theory provides an effective framework for studying
LTAD as a social change, as it can be considered a social
innovation that affects the way sport is delivered. The indi-
viduals responsible for adopting and implementing LTAD are
coaches, and social innovation is the LTAD model.
The diffusion of innovation process (Figure 1) depicts how
individuals move from their initial knowledge of an innovation
toward its adoption and implementation in their practice
(Rogers, 2003). Prior to and during innovation adoption,
Beaudoin et al. 3
individuals are persuaded to adopt its positive attributes when
they are interested and actively seek information or details
about it (Rogers, 2003). The five attributes that influence an
individual to adopt or reject an innovation are (a) the relative
advantage that it has over other innovations; (b) compatibility
of the innovation with the individual's own values, past experi-
ences, or needs; (c) complexity of the innovation, meaning the
degree to which it is perceived as easy or difficult to under-
stand; (d) trialability of the innovation, meaning the ability of
individuals to experiment with the innovation; and (e) observ-
ability of the innovation, meaning an individuals' ability to
observe the effects of the innovation.
Regarding the implementation stage, Rogers (2003)
determined that it occurs "when an individual (or other deci-
sion-making unit) puts an innovation to use" (p. 179). Rogers
explained that implementation involves behavior change
related to the innovation. During the implementation stage,
the innovation can be reinvented, meaning "the degree to
which an innovation is changed or modified by a user in the
process of its adoption and implementation" (Rogers, 2003,
p. 180). Rogers noted that a great deal of reinvention occurred
for many innovations, and sometimes only parts of it were
adopted or implemented.
Method
Case Study
We took a case study approach. As discussed by Yin (2003),
"the case study is used in many situations to contribute to our
knowledge of individual, group, organizational, social, polit-
ical, and related phenomena" (p. 1). Our case study is appro-
priate because its purpose is to gain deeper understanding of
a complex phenomenon: how coaches adopt and implement
Sport Canada's LTAD model. We investigated this phenom-
enon in its real-life context, as experienced by coaches. Each
coach provided valuable information individually and col-
lectively, providing insight into the phenomenon studied.
Sampling and Recruiting of Participants
The University of Ottawa and Université du Québec à Trois-
Rivières ethics boards approved the project. An information
letter was sent by email to 40 national and provincial sport
organizations to invite their coaches to fill out a short online
questionnaire. The sport organizations either posted the letter
on their website or included it in their newsletter. The ques-
tionnaire was designed to verify, on a Likert-type scale, how
much coaches knew about LTAD, by asking, "How much do
you know about Sport Canada's LTAD model?"At the end of
the questionnaire, an open-ended question invited coaches to
take part in an individual interview and to give us their tele-
phone number and email address if they agreed to participate
further.
Study Participants
Two groups of coaches participated in the study: One group
was composed of coaches who decided to adopt LTAD (par-

tially or totally) and the other group was in the implementa-
tion stage (i.e., fourth stage of the decision process).
Adoption study. For studying adoption, 112 coaches from the
province of Quebec (francophones and anglophones)
responded to the survey and, of them, 52 (46%) agreed to
participate in personal interviews. We engaged a selection
strategy (purposeful sampling) to recruit participants who
decided to adopt LTAD with different levels of knowledge,
(a) being very familiar with it, (b) had limited knowledge of
it, or (c) knew very little about it. A total of 31 coaches were
contacted by email or telephone, and 14 (numbered from 1 to
14) agreed to participate in an individual interview.
Implementation study.Of the 86 English-speaking coaches
from Canada who accepted to answer the questionnaire, 36
volunteered to participate in individual interviews (41.8%).
Purposeful sampling (Creswell, 2013) was adopted as a strat-
egy for participant selection for the interview based on three
criteria in their questionnaire responses: (a) coaches were
actively coaching, (b) those with certification from the
NCCP, and (c) they were knowledgeable about the LTAD
model. Twenty-four of the 36 coaches who volunteered for
the interview qualified by meeting the abovementioned crite-
ria. Ten coaches were randomly chosen and completed the
interview component on implementation (numbered from 15
to 24). They were contacted by email or telephone, depend-
ing on the information they had given in the survey, and were
invited to participate in the interview process.
Instruments
The qualitative part of the study took a narrative approach to
develop an interview guide (Elliott, 2005). Conducted by
telephone, the interviews lasted between 45 to 75 min, and
were digitally recorded. The researchers developed an inter-
view guide based on Rogers's theoretical framework, includ-
ing questions regarding whether and how the coaches had
either adopted or implemented the LTAD model. The inter-
view guide also included questions about their perceptions of
the barriers they had encountered. During the interview, par-
ticipants were encouraged to recount their experiences in
learning about and implementing the LTAD model. Elliott
(2005) explained that narrative interviews helped partici-
pants to organize a "sequence of events into a whole so that
each event can be understood through its relation to that
whole" (p. 3).
Adoption study. The interview guide included three sections:
(a) coach history, in which questions were asked, such as,
"Tell me about yourself as an athlete and as a coach," "What
is your background in sport?" and "How did you get started?"
(b) LTAD model characteristics, as presented in Rogers's
theoretical framework, in which questions included, "What
are the advantages or disadvantages of the LTAD model?"
"How is the model compatible or incompatible with your
values, past experiences as a coach, and the needs of your
sport and athletes?" and (c) perceived barriers or enablers
during LTAD adoption in which the question was, "Did you
experience any barriers in adopting the LTAD model? If so,
please explain." Probing questions were asked to flesh out
initial answers.
Implementation study. The interview guide for the implemen-
tation study was similar to the one used by the adoption
study. Sections 1 and 2 were the same as for the adoption
study. Section 3 was oriented with questions on implementa-
tion such as, "Did you experience any barriers in implement-
ing the LTAD model? If so, please explain"--to gain insights
into perceived barriers of LTAD adoption.
Data Analysis
Each interview was transcribed verbatim and uploaded into
the QSR NVivo 9 Qualitative software program. As sug-
gested by Yin (2003), interview content was analyzed. First,
a deductive approach (Patton, 2002), focusing broadly on
Rogers's theoretical framework, transformed the transcribed
interviews into "meaning units" with the following codes:
(a) coaches' attributes, including subcodes for their athletic
experience, coaching certification, the sport(s) they coached
in, their duties as coaches, the level of athletes they coached,
and the years of experience they had as coaches; (b) Rogers's
innovation-decision process, including subcodes for the
stages: knowledge, persuasion, decision, adoption, imple-
mentation, and confirmation (Figure 1); and (c) barriers to
adoption and implementation of the LTAD model. The coded
statements were reviewed independently by a second
research team member. The researchers took an inductive
approach to further examine the data coded under the imple-
mentation stage for undiscovered patterns. Finally, meaning
units within the code "Barriers to LTAD model adoption or
implementation" were subcoded to examine barriers that
pertained directly to LTAD model implementation. These
were divided according to two main patterns in LTAD model
adoption or implementation, as described above.
Adoption study.Seven coded statements presenting differ-
ences were appraised, discussed, and reviewed indepen-
dently by a second research team member. Agreement was
reached by consensus, enabling validation of statement inter-
pretation for each category (Yardley, 2008). A total of 194
statements were analyzed, 27 for relative advantage, 39 for
compatibility, 25 for complexity, 20 for trialability, 13 for
observability, 27 for communication channels, and, finally,
43 for barriers to adoption.
Implementation study. Owing to the large number of coded
meaning units within Rogers's innovation-decision
process (119) and particularly within the subcode for the
Beaudoin et al. 5
implementation stage (43 meaning units), it became
apparent that the majority of coaches were in the process
of implementing LTAD. To understand how coaches came
to implement the model, meaning units within the persua-
sion stage code (33) were further examined, and all the
data, in a second round of analysis, were further coded
according to Rogers's five attributes of innovation--relative
advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and
observability--generating 113 additional meaning units.
Inductively, it became clear that there were two main pat-
terns in LTAD model implementation: (a) coaches consid-
ered information on LTAD in specific stages according to the
level of athletes they coached, and (b) they viewed the LTAD
model as a global vision, philosophy, or planning tool for the
development of athletes across stages.
Results
Adoption Study
Participants' characteristics. A total of 14 coaches (5 female, 9
male) from various regions of Quebec participated in the
LTAD adoption study (Table 1). These coaches all partici-
pated as athletes in sport competitions at various levels in the
past except for Coach 6. Most had experience as coaches in
competitive environments, except for one who was involved
only at the community level (Coach 5). Thus, all these
coaches were engaged from development Stage 3 (Learning
to Train) and subsequent stages. Coach 5 was involved at
Stages 1 (Active start) and 2 (FUNdamentals).
Among coaches who participated in the LTAD adoption
study, eight were very familiar with the model, three consid-
ered themselves as being moderately knowledgeable, and
three others knew very little about LTAD. It should be noted
that coaches who knew very little about LTAD were mainly
involved in sports with early development, such as gymnas-
tics and figure skating, but were in the process of adopting it
(Table 1). The third coach in this situation was Coach 5, who
worked in baseball at the community level. All coaches had
heard about the model through their provincial and/or
national federations.
Perceptions of Innovation's Five Attributes
The majority of coaches had favorable perceptions of
LTAD. As discussed by Rogers (2003), positive perception,
in most cases, increased the likelihood of adoption of the
proposed innovation (LTAD), while negative perception
more likely led coaches to reject it. The following section
presents interview results on the five key predictors of
innovation adoption: relative advantage, compatibility,
complexity, trialability, and observability.
Relative advantage.The relative advantage is the degree to
which an innovation is perceived as being better than the
idea it supersedes. The relative benefits of LTAD perceived
by coaches were many and varied (27 statements). However,
the positive central element that emerged from the percep-
tions of all coaches (except the two coaches in gymnastics
and figure skating) was a long-term vision of athletes, the
need to respect and follow their human development, and
support the development of their full potential:
In fact, long-term development brings more athletes to their
full potential with a common provincial and national vision.

These coaches also emphasized that the model provides a
framework, a tool with which they could work and get the
feeling of going in the right direction:
I think it is important to have structure because it gives us good
foundations. We have a model to follow and if we respect it, we
know exactly what the goal is, what it is going to give us,
technically, tactically, physically. (Coach 14)
Compatibility. Compatibility, for its part, is how LTAD can be
consistent with the values, past experiences, and needs of
coaches. All coaches acknowledged that several components
of LTAD were compatible with their values and practice (39
statements). At first, 12 of the 14 coaches recognized that
LTAD presented components of training they already applied:
We used this concept since a long time. (Coach 1)
These elements have always been part of my practice. (Coach 9)
Another coach refers to xc-skiing, a late development
sport for which the sport's governing body had already
adopted the LTAD model at the time of the interview:
Given that we are a "late development" sport, we indirectly
followed this model without necessarily knowing it. Thus, the
model came as a confirmation for me. (Coach 11)
In a second step, all coaches (except for the two in gym-
nastics and figure skating) saw that various LTAD compo-
nents matched their values. They (a) practiced various
sports and avoided early specialization, (b) developed basic
skills and took pleasure in playing these sports, (c) respected
the rhythm of natural growth in children and young ath-
letes, and (d) had a healthy lifestyle and exercised over a
lifetime.
Finally, some coaches stressed that LTAD was a new tool
that met the needs of coaches who had little experience.
LTAD is a wonderful tool for new coaches coming in, those who
are volunteers and do not have much training. Many told me:
"Wow! Finally, we have the tools we can apply." (Coach 11)
Complexity. Rogers (2003) referred to the notion of complex-
ity by the degree of difficulty in understanding and deploy-
ing the proposed innovation (25 statements). If LTAD seems
relatively easy to understand at first, to use and integrate it in
coaching practice are perceived very differently, particularly
in the early stages of development, as expressed by one
coach:
Yes, you can share in the vision, but they are significant changes
not obvious in practice. The biggest change is much more with
coaches involved with young athletes and yet it is those
(coaches) who are the least equipped. (Coach 9)
In addition, some coaches emphasized that LTAD had not
addressed their difficulty in planning their athletes' training
and had not helped to ascertain the development stage of
young athletes:
Planning: That's the challenge. Anyone can understand LTAD,
but they will say, "How can I do that?" It gets tricky when
observing movement and estimating maturity, to establish what
kind of activity can be suitable and to work with young people
in different developmental stages. (Coach 9)
It is these remarks that drive most coaches to discuss the
great need for additional training to ascertain the develop-
mental stages of their athletes, without which it may be very
difficult to integrate LTAD in practice.
Trialability. Trialability is an important feature in the decision
to adopt or reject innovation because, here, it is possible to
see if coaches are able to explore certain components of the
proposed innovation (Rogers, 2003). Thus, if coaches could
experience some components of the model and get satisfac-
tion from it, they will be more likely to adopt it. The majority
of coaches (8/10) had already experienced some parts of
LTAD, which brought various adjustments to their practice at
the time of the interview (20 statements). This was the case
with one female soccer coach:
I think that as a coach I did not respect the stages. I realize that
it is important to make adaptations according to age group.
Although I personally like to make my training sessions
competitive, I believe that with 6-7-year-old kids, it may not
necessarily be good to bring competition to training sessions.
So, after reviewing the model, I adapted my training sessions.
(Coach 14)
However, the reality of certain sports in a competitive sys-
tem can create multiple barriers. This is the case with triathlon
coaching but more specifically its swimming component:
In swimming, it is not possible because the short-term results are
extremely important when hiring coaches, ensuring the
continuity of their career and providing feedback from club
administrators or parents. The way this is actually done makes it
very difficult to apply LTAD because of the expectation of short-
term results. (Coach 7)
Observability.As defined by Rogers (2003), observability is
the last feature to target if the results of innovation are visible
to others in the community where it is released. In this
respect, although the majority of coaches believed that the
benefits of LTAD would be observed only in 10 or 15 years,
they still expressed strong conviction of a positive impact:
I see that young people have the desire to continue playing
sports. When I say "playing sport," I am sure that some young
athletes at any given time will say that they have discovered
Beaudoin et al. 7
another sport. In the long run, it will help our young people who
want to pursue sports. (Coach 1)
Another coach spoke of benefits on the physical side that
he saw in some athletes:
When you take the time to do things differently, there are always
long-term benefits in the end. For example, for agility in
basketball, I see great improvements in athletes who are less
coordinated, particularly due to growth spurts. (Coach 13)
Another outcome perceived by a xc-ski coach was perfor-
mance upgrade in their discipline:
I think that our sport has become better in the last five or six
years. It will perhaps take another 10 years to see the benefits of
this model. Their development is probably achieved by keeping
them longer in the sport. (Coach 11)
Adoption Process by Coaches
Analyzing coaches' perceptions of LTAD characteristics as
an innovation theory can help to identifying enablers and
barriers that influence coaches' decisions to adopt or imple-
ment LTAD (Rogers, 2003). Table 2 provides a synthesis of
coaches' decision process described in the previous section.
First, knowledge of the model and the role of coaches'
training are essential for a critical look at proposed innova-
tions and their adoption (Table 2). Two coaches (in gymnas-
tics and figure skating) knew very little about LTAD from the
start and were at the beginning of adoption (Table 3). Thus,
knowing LTAD's benefits and compatibility could have per-
suaded them that it could be positive for them and their
athletes.
Many factors influenced the adoption process in coaches
(Table 2). Coaches in track and field (Coaches 1 and 3) and
xc-ski (Coaches 6 and 11) seem to have adopted LTAD for
the following reasons: (a) long-term vision for athletes
already present in their sport, (b) validation of what they
were doing right, and (c) the organizational structure of their
sport. For the adoption process, being able to try some of
LTAD's components and living positive experiences have
enabled the majority of coaches (two in track and field, two
in xc-skiing, three in soccer, two in baseball, and one in bas-
ketball) to perceive positive impacts of the LTAD model.
Although they were in agreement with the principles and
long-term approach with LTAD, in practice, many barriers
hindered its full adoption. Also, two triathlon coaches
(Coaches 4 and 7) encountered several barriers linked to the
culture and organizational structure of their sport, which led
us to believe that LTAD adoption was very difficult for them.

Finally, LTAD's perceived complexity inhibited its imple-
mentation in the daily practice of these coaches (Table 2).
Therefore, barriers perceived by coaches may counterbal-
ance their decisions and hinder the possibility of full LTAD
implementation in their practice.
Implementation Study
Ten coaches (2 female, 8 male) were interviewed to gain an
understanding of their decision and process to adopt or reject
the LTAD model (Table 1). Four of the 10 coaches interviewed
were coaching in more than one sport. Finally, 8 coaches noted
that they knew the LTAD model either very well or quite well.
Two of them said they were somewhat knowledgeable.
Persuasion.Coaches were persuaded (33 meaning units) to
adopt the LTAD model according to attributes described in Rog-
ers's framework. All 10 coaches interviewed described how
they were persuaded to take up the LTAD model because of its
compatibility (37 meaning units) with their values, its relative
advantage (28 meaning units) over other models, its trialability
(13 meaning units), and its observability (14 meaning units).
Coaches involved in our study were persuaded to use the
LTAD model because they all believed that it was compatible
with their personal values. The following quotes show how
coaches found the model to be compatible with their own
coaching values and approach. Coach 7 stated that "The LTAD
makes a lot of intuitive sense when you understand the ratio-
nale behind it," while Coach 17 pointed out that "I became
aware of LTAD early in my soccer coaching career. It resonated
with me and made a lot of sense." For these reasons, coaches
said they were easily persuaded to implement the model.
The following quotes indicate how coaches found the
LTAD model to be relatively advantageous (28 meaning
units) compared with previous approaches in coaching:
I think LTAD gives us some structure, especially at the lower
levels. The pathway is now clearer for everybody. (Coach 24)
Coach 22 asserted how division of athletes' development
into defined stages helped them to speak a common language
with other stakeholders:
The best part for me starting out (with LTAD) was actually
categorizing athletes, not just by age, but by "Learning to Train,"
"Training to Compete," and that kind of thing . . . Once
everybody speaks the same language, then it's easier to turn it
around and make it work.
These advantages helped persuade coaches to implement
the model. Coaches also noted that the model influenced club

structure (14 meaning units). This, in turn, persuaded them to
implement LTAD because they could see the layout of the
model and how it fit with the level they were coaching:
The ski club presented to parents' meetings in the fall and
aligned the programs with appropriate LTAD nomenclature . . .
"Training to Train," "Learning to Train," etc. I think just
designating groups by these names brings focus and has some
impact . . . getting some people to think about LTAD. (Coach 15)
Finally, the coaches noted that they could try out the
model (13 meaning units), which led to their LTAD adher-
ence. Some of the persuasion needed to adopt a new innova-
tion includes its trialability. As one coach explained, the
coaches at his club were able to learn about LTAD, begin to
understand, and then implement its principles.
It's not like the club changed everything it did overnight and set
up a system that was completely LTAD-based. Slowly, as people
have come to know more about it, the way things have been
done has changed a bit in accordance with that. (Coach 21)
One coach simply stated that LTAD was already being
implemented by the other coaches in his club, and so when
he started coaching, it was a natural inclusion into his
approach.
LTAD was part of the training. I was first introduced to it through
my ski club three years ago. When I started coaching, it (LTAD)
was already in the club atmosphere. (Coach 18)
As the coaches were already persuaded to adopt the LTAD
model, they started to implement it in various ways while
coaching their athletes.
Implementation of the LTAD model by coaches.Two patterns
appeared to dominate the coaches' ways of implementing
LTAD (43 meaning units). First, all 10 coaches interviewed
seemed to acquire information from specific stages (includ-
ing relevant principles) of the LTAD model, which, although
allowing them to use the model in a way that aided their own
coaching approaches, also led to a host of barriers that they
perceived with its implementation (40 meaning units). Sec-
ond, 7 of these 10 coaches understood the LTAD model as a
global vision of how athletes should develop in sport and
they implemented it as a planning tool. With this approach,
there appeared to be fewer barriers to LTAD model imple-
mentation (15 meaning units). However, such an approach
can only be taken when coaches have sufficient understand-
ing of the whole model.
Implementation according to the development stages.All 10
coaches interviewed seemed more specifically interested in
stages of development in the LTAD model that pertained to
the level of athletes they coached, and they were also inter-
ested in specific principles in these stages.
One coach discussed how he learned from the model, spe-
cifically with athletes in the fundamental stage of develop-
ment (6- to 8-year-old females, 6- to 9-year-old males), to play
games with children and to develop their physical literacy, as
the LTAD model endorses within this stage of development:
Now I use the idea that LTAD makes it fun for kids, and finding
what is fun gains their interest, and helps them learn fundamental
skills and game intelligence. (Coach 17)
This coach determined that athletes became more engaged
once he implemented his game approach according to the
LTAD model in the FUNdamental stage (6-year-old and
younger).
Another coach, of boys in the "Learn to Train" stage (8- to
11-year-old females, 9- to 12-year-old males) focused on
LTAD's trainability factor to understand when and how to
train his athletes' skills and physical abilities.
With our 10-year-old boys' soccer team last year, we didn't
spend time specifically trying to develop their aerobic system
because teaching them that is a waste of time. We spent time
focusing on the things that they were more receptive to learn and
focus on. You need to have a long-term mentality, and it's a
long-term program. Winning isn't and shouldn't be the focus in
the short-term. (Coach 21)
A coach in the "Train to Train" stage explained how he
used the factor of developmental age to determine when to
begin strength training with his athletes based on their growth
and maturation.
Our strength training begins at under 14 year old (U14), but it leans
moretowardsresistanceexercises,withweightedballs,coordination
movements and simple plyometric exercises. With females, we're
able to incorporate resistance work earlier than with boys because
of maturation, as the LTAD model explains. (Coach 16)
On the contrary, a gymnastics coach ascertained that the
number of hours prescribed by the LTAD model as part of the
10-year rule factor was difficult to follow for her more com-
petitive young athletes. She chose when to implement this
factor and when not to do so.
Provincial gymnastics coaches were all in a bit of a panic with
LTAD because we're an early immersion sport. LTAD
recommend eight weekly hours for the nine-year-olds, but we do
12 to 18 hours . . . So when parents ask if their child can train
more hours, if he or she is able to handle more, I say "do it." But
if they're unable to handle more training, I quote the LTAD and
say, "According to this document, and all the work that's gone
into it, we support the fact that athletes should be involved in
other things." (Coach 23)
What is interesting is that this coach specifically picked
up on one factor within the model and chose when to use it or
not.

Barriers to Adoption and Implementation
Barriers to adoption. Barriers to adoption are presented along
the decision process. In our study, four main barriers to adop-
tion stood out with the majority of coaches: (a) lack of LTAD
knowledge and training; (b) shortage of competent coaches,
including parents; (c) inadequate sports culture and organi-
zational structures; and (d) emphasis placed on results, that is
to say, the performance of athletes or sports teams.
The majority of coaches underlined how lack of LTAD
knowledge and training slowed adoption of the new model.
A figure skating coach mentioned that not knowing enough
about the model hindered its exploitation:
For me, not knowing the model enough is a real barrier. I miss a lot
of information, especially how to adapt it to my discipline . . . I
think if I had all this information, I would apply LTAD. (Coach 12)
More than half of coaches underlined that preparing
coaches was important as it could contribute to LTAD adop-
tion and implementation.
We need to make coaching education mandatory for all coaches
starting in that role and everything should commence from the
beginning with the model. Do not forget that for children who
start at 7-8 years, the parents who coach them usually know
nothing about the sport--as they do it out of kindness . . . .
(Coach 10)
Some coaches feel that a paradox exists in the current
sports culture. The model represents a long-term approach to
meet the growth and development of young athletes, whereas
organizational sport structures encourage them to engage early
in competition and often leads to their overspecialization.
I gave a presentation on the long-term development of athletes
at the soccer federation and they laughed at me. They said: "We
cannot do that!" I replied that there should not be elite-class
competitive soccer before the age of 12 years for girls and 14
years for boys . . . and they told me that it would never change!
(Coach 7)
Some coaches underscored that the emphasis on results, in
terms of performance of young athletes or teams, is a big bar-
rier to LTAD adoption and implementation. So how is it possi-
ble to reconcile an approach based on the long-term
development of young athletes with the attraction of short-term
results? This is how a triathlon coach explained the situation:
Look at the structure of swimming here. Even if coaches are
fairly high level and are aware of the need for youth development,
the major issue is that recognition comes with performance, it
becomes a vicious circle. What counts are our short-term results.
(Coach 4)
Such situations inevitably lead coaches to run aground in
insufficient financial resources, and they are dependent on
the performance of their athletes. As explained by the same
triathlon coach,
People always focus on financial issues, searching for sponsors.
This is only short-term and far removed from concerns about the
quality of interventions in our youth and their long-term
development . . . . (Coach 4)
In addition, as pointed out by this coach, such a sport cul-
ture often pushes coaches and athletes to look for shortcuts,
recipes, or interventions to attain high-level but short-term
performance:
Basically, when we coach, it is normal to want to win a season,
and it is very easy to focus on that rather than think about youth
development. So we sometimes skip the teaching of certain
skills to focus more on specific things that will help to win.
(Coach 13)
Barriers to implementation.Coaches noted that there were
specific barriers as a result of implementing LTAD. The bar-
riers included lack of information on some stages of develop-
ment in the LTAD model (11 meaning units), a lack of
understanding of the other stages of development within the
model (14 meaning units), and, perhaps most notably,
coaches had trouble assessing the developmental stage of
their athletes and following recommendations within the
LTAD model (15 meaning units).
One coach noted that there were no technical and tactical
drills that gave coaches the tools to implement the LTAD mod-
el's recommendations. Acknowledging that LTAD is a model
that addresses the many stages of athlete development, two
coaches noted that they only really understood the LTAD
model within the age category that they coached. Therefore, a
barrier for them in implementing the LTAD model was that
they did not understand the model fully. Coach 24 said,
I've gone over it (LTAD). I'm not going to say I fully understand
it. The youngest I've ever taught is 16- and 17-year-old athletes.
I've never taught anybody under that. So for me to use the LTAD
with younger stages would be a barrier to me.
Another coach explained that the determination of devel-
opmental age, measuring the growth and development of
individual athletes to develop skills at proper times, is hard to
implement in team sports where chronological age serves to
place athletes on teams.
Sometimes stages are hard to differentiate--you tend to treat all
12-year-olds the same. I'm not sure how you don't when it's a
team sport . . . you've got all kinds of 12-year-olds, some who
are small and others who look like men--especially around
puberty. (Coach 19)
Indeed, six coaches found it hard to implement LTAD
model directions explicitly for certain stages of develop-
ment. As Coach 15 explained,
Beaudoin et al. 11
The whole concept around puberty in terms of athletes'
development and monitoring their growth, to look for peak
height velocity and all those fancy terms . . . I don't see 97% of
coaches out there involved in measuring their athletes' height
differences on a monthly basis. I'm not sure many coaches out
there have the time or motivation to do so.
The same coach determined that the LTAD model could
be perceived as a barrier to athlete development if coaches
fixated on specific recommendations. Instead, he suggested
that LTAD was best considered as a guideline:
Some people accept precise details of LTAD as gospel . . . if
Johnny didn't complete 359 hours of aerobic conditioning by
the age of 13 years and 3 months, he's out of luck, and he's never
going to make it as a skier. (Coach 15)
Implementation as a Global Vision for Athlete
Development Over Time
Seven coaches considered the LTAD model to be a guide or
a plan with a global vision for athlete development. These
seven coaches noted that LTAD was a vision for coaching
individuals across their life span. This was useful as it pro-
vided a framework for the coaches' lesson plans:
I used it (LTAD) as baseline, kind of like a course curriculum. I
developed an outline and then wrote down my objectives.
(Coach 20)
Here's the rough outline . . . there's a certain skill set or physical
ability that this age group player should have. (Coach 19)
Coaches also cited the LTAD model when explaining
their plan to athletes and parents. It enabled them to have a
tool with which to explain their coaching approach.
What I like to explain to the parents and athletes are the keys
stages. Following the LTAD, I'm developing all core skills for
movement and sport in younger children. At 12 to 14 years, we
can introduce competition or preparation for events. (Coach 18)
More specifically, one coach talked about how explaining
the LTAD model to parents helped them relax in regard to
their child's sport development.
I spend time speaking to parents about goals, expectations, and
processes (according to LTAD), and I find them much more
relaxed when they understand that kids develop at different rates
. . . . (Coach 17)
Barriers to implementation as a global vision.Seven coaches
discussed barriers that prevented them from fully imple-
menting LTAD (15 meaning units). These included lack of
support and evidence-based research of the LTAD model, its
complexity, and the difficulty in ensuring that all individuals
working with athletes (coaches, parents, and support staff)
adhered to LTAD recommendations.
In general, coaches felt that there was no support to help
them learn about the LTAD model. Some coaches noted that
the coach education courses where they learned the LTAD
model were too time-consuming and that they could not take
the many courses required to fully understand the model.
Others who had received their certification from the old
NCCP system (Levels 1-5) noted that they were not required
to recertify and so they never had the opportunity to learn the
LTAD model. Still others noted that even after learning about
the LTAD model, they were unsure whether it would really
improve athlete development over the course of their entire
athletic careers. As one coach said,
If you take a group of nine-year-olds and you do lots of speed
training with them, and you take another group of nine-year-olds
and you don't do any speed training, then when they are 19 years
old, is one group significantly better off than the other group as
a result of what they did? I don't believe that sort of research has
been done so . . . are we really sure that the LTAD is right?
(Coach 15)
To this coach, the lack of evidence-based research regard-
ing the model was a barrier because it led him to question
whether or not to implement it.
Probably the greatest barrier to implementing LTAD as a
global vision for developing athletes is its sheer complexity.
One coach called the LTAD model "a bit daunting" (Coach
21). This coach noted that understanding how athletes
develop over the course of their childhood and adolescence
is a huge undertaking.
If you gave me a piece of paper and asked me to draw the graph,
to getall windows (of trainability) in the right places, I couldn't
do it. I read those documents a bunch of times but I would still
fail the exam, so to speak. (Coach 21)
Indeed, not only is complexity a barrier for coaches, but
coaches must also properly describe the model to parents to
get them on board. The coaches noted that parents play an
important role in ensuring that coaches implement the LTAD
model and that athletes are following their advice:
The LTAD is a bit of an overhaul of information because your
athletes don't necessarily get the information directly. You
would have to go through the parents. (Coach 20)
Coaches felt that it was difficult to properly implement
the LTAD model without educating parents about the de-
emphasis on winning and competition at younger ages. An
ice hockey coach explained,
Each year is an education process for parents, learning training
to game ratios, rest and taking a long-term approach. I find that
it's always a challenge. (Coach 17)
12 SAGE Open
A barrier to implementing the LTAD model as a global
vision was getting everybody committed to the LTAD model.
In other words, if everyone working with athletes throughout
their development was not on board with the model, then
athletes would not have the continuity needed to ensure suc-
cess. One coach suggested that head coaches organize their
coaching staff to understand and implement the LTAD model
to ensure athletic success:
If you leave LTAD implementation up to individuals, you're
going to get a fair bit of variability and that doesn't lend itself
well to the kids who might move from coach to coach and not
get consistency. (Coach 21)
Taking a long-term global view of the LTAD model, coaches,
parents, support staff, and athletes have to be aware of and
understand it--to have the same vision for implementation.
Discussion
The purpose of this article was to explore how Canadian
coaches adopted or implemented Sport Canada's LTAD
model and to understand the barriers they perceived in adopt-
ing and implementing it. Rogers's (2003) theoretical frame-
work served to understand the decision-making process of
coaches and to analyze their perception of the model's char-
acteristics influencing their decision to adopt or reject this
social innovation or the process of implementation once it
was adopted.
The Five Attributes of Innovation and LTAD
Adoption and Implementation
The five attributes of an innovation, as stated in Rogers's
(2003) theoretical model (relative advantage, compatibility,
complexity, trialability, and observability), provide a concep-
tual framework for understanding what may have limited or
helped LTAD adoption and implementation by coaches.
Knowledge of the model. Knowledge is the first determinant
of innovation adoption. More than half of participants in the
adoption part of the study reported very good knowledge of
LTAD, and all coaches had already acquired some LTAD
facts before it was introduced by Sport Canada. Communica-
tion channels for information on LTAD are available to
coaches through sports (national or provincial) federations.
Information is transmitted in several ways, but in most cases
during coaching seminars. This could be due to the fact that
coaches who responded to the invitation to participate in the
study were experienced, and most of them had a relatively
high level of training before LTAD's arrival. Therefore, they
did not attend recent coaching seminars for new certification
(Table 3). However, coaches with lower level LTAD knowl-
edge also had lower level coaching certification. Indeed, the
three coaches who reported having little knowledge of LTAD
were at Levels 1 (n = 2) or 2 (n = 1), and their experience as
coaches was, respectively, 6, 11, and 12 years. However,
they recognized that the model's merits resided in the devel-
opment of knowledge cohesiveness as a whole. Many
coaches observed that sport in Canada was still driven by
many parent volunteers who had little or no knowledge of
their sport. It is one of the tenets of LTAD that better coaches
of younger athletes would help to develop all the basic skills
proposed in LTAD (Balyi, Way, & Higgs, 2013). Therefore,
it is a challenge to better prepare coaches, even those involved
with younger athletes.
Coaches at the level of implementing LTAD and who per-
ceived that they had better knowledge of the LTAD model
exploited it not only for information pertaining to their ath-
letes'stages of development but also as an overarching vision
of athlete development, so that they deemed the model to be
a guide for athlete development in general.
Coaches in early development sports may be less familiar
with LTAD, as two of them, who knew very little about the
model, were from this type of sport (gymnastics and figure
skating). However, it remains to be confirmed in a larger
study sample with objective measures of LTAD knowledge
as the present study measured the perception of knowledge
of LTAD. Gymnastics Canada and Skate Canada produced
an LTAD guide for coaches and parents in 2008 and 2010,
respectively. Our gymnastics coach (Coach 2), who lived in
a remote area, testified about the challenges of having access
to continued education in coaching. However, such was not
the case with our figure skating coach (Coach 12). The
model, in its original form (Balyi & Way, 1995), was much
less compatible with the type of performance progression
observed in early development sports, whereas in our days,
the revised version of LTAD and the new structure of the
NCCP, adding the community sport coach approach, offer
more opportunities to integrate LTAD in most sports organi-
zations. This subject warrants further investigation.
Relative advantages of LTAD. LTAD was the first athlete devel-
opment model officially adopted in Canadian sport as part of
a policy. Thus, LTAD itself does not replace an existing
model. This may partially explain the positive perception of
LTAD by coaches. The relative advantages perceived by
coaches can be divided into two categories, those favoring
athlete development and those associated with coaches'
duties. The majority of coaches emphasized the importance
of designing training plans respecting the developmental
stages of athletes as persons and not just performers. The
benefits related to athletic performance have not been
emphasized probably because there is currently no evidence
showing that this model is more effective than others in pro-
ducing better athletes and more of them. Coaches at the level
of implementation also perceived relative advantages from
LTAD. The main advantage was the "creation of a common
language with other stakeholders," particularly parents. For
coaches, it is a tool to help their interaction with parents.
Beaudoin et al. 13
Trialability and observability were also identified as positive
features of LTAD but were much less often mentioned than
compatibility and relative advantages (Table 2). Indeed, it is
evident that to really study impacts of LTAD, a cohort of
athletes would need to be longitudinally followed during
their careers as only parts of the LTAD model are evidence
based.
Depending on their duties, many coaches mentioned help-
fulness of the model in guiding new coaches and facilitating
communication with parents. This is consistent with the find-
ings of Black and Holt (2009)--that the relative advantage of
"speaking the same language" (vision and common tongue)
has helped alpine ski coaches in Alberta, Canada. However,
their work also indicated that a common language facilitated
by LTAD was not associated with a total "buy in" of the
model by coaches (Black & Holt, 2009).
Compatibility. At first glance, we see that LTAD is compatible
with the values of the coaches interviewed. Others suggest
that the model validated their own approach and that of some
parents.Again, this point was cited by Black and Holt (2009).
Many themes emerged that indicated positive influences on
LTAD implementation (Figure 1). Coaches considered that
LTAD was compatible with their values, which may not be
surprising. As mentioned by Collins and Bailey (2013), is it
because LTAD incorporates ". . . much face-valid and simple
advice, guidance that is so fundamental and sound that it is
almost irrefutable . . . ?" (p. 186) Or is it attributable to previ-
ous knowledge of some LTAD components (e.g., avoidance
of early specialization and prevention of dropping-out) that
were already presented in curricula of university physical
education or kinesiology programs or other forums? How-
ever, a problem has been raised about LTAD compatibility
with the organizational structure of sport that generally grati-
fies short-term success, rejecting athletes and coaches who
do not achieve this kind of goal. It is a major digression in
LTAD implementation that will have to be addressed to cre-
ate compatibility between LTAD, the actors in the system,
and the sport system itself. Moreover, several examples show
that short-term success, defined mainly by wins and endorsed
by the sport system, hamper the development of athletes and
ultimately the ability to retain young people who would oth-
erwise have reached their full potential later. One example is
the phenomenon of "relative age effect" in which younger
individuals in a category are less likely to progress to higher
or competitive categories and are possibly more inclined to
leave the sport (Musch & Grondin, 2001). Another example
is the overspecialization of athletes, which is considered det-
rimental to the development of a repertoire of general motor
skills (Fransen etal., 2012). In today's sports culture, the
emphasis on results brings a whole lot of profit, instant satis-
faction for athletes and their parents, coach recognition,
increased coaching salaries, sponsors, government grants,
and so forth. The effect of these factors may be obvious at
higher levels of competition. However, even in younger
categories, they may exert negative influences and heighten
the risk of early specialization and its consequences (Malina,
2010).
Complexity.While understanding LTAD principles, coaches
emphasized difficulties in taking action, especially when it
came to (a) determining athletes' stages of development and
(b) planning short- and long-term training according to
stages. At the stage of implementation, two patterns emerged
in LTAD implementation. First, some coaches took informa-
tion from the model that pertained directly to the stage of
development in which their athletes fit. These coaches found
that barriers existed in implementing the LTAD model,
including a dearth of information on particular stage, a lack
of understanding stages different from their own athletes,
and trouble identifying the developmental stage of their ath-
letes, to follow LTAD model recommendations. Other criti-
cisms particularly matched with this study included a lack of
guidelines for LTAD implementation. Some coaches wanted
specific technical and tactical drills or exercises that would
help with implementation in their sport, while others found
that the lack of specific guidelines allowed coaches to con-
sider the model more as a guide without adhering too strictly
to its recommendations. This reinforces the need for coach-
ing education, citing concrete examples of these two identi-
fied difficulties to be overcome once LTAD principles are
well understood. Continuing education on more practical
aspects of training is warranted.
Trialability. For some coaches, it was clear that an approach,
such as LTAD, with long-term outputs, makes its full imple-
mentation illusory at the moment. However, the majority of
coaches interviewed were able to engage some LTAD prin-
ciples. Although they experienced certain beneficial effects,
they indicated that it was often difficult to explain their rele-
vance to others. Gratification of short-term success, as
expressed by a swimming coach, was a limiting factor of
trialability. There is a perceived risk to try LTAD with ath-
letes. By following the LTAD approach, not aiming at short-
term success, and not knowing if success will come later,
coaches as well as parents may fear that their athletes may
never be successful. Therefore, each sport may suggest inter-
mediate goals (competencies, skills, etc.) to coaches and ath-
letes that may help them to follow progression based on
developmental stages and not uniquely on results (medals,
ranks, etc.).
Observability. Some coaches have already begun to perceive
the positive effects of LTAD, including persistence not only
in sport and physical activity among young people but also in
the acquisition of motor skills. In the latter case, it is difficult
to see what effect this will have on performance. However, a
xc-ski coach has already begun to witness a new generation
of athletes. It is noteworthy that Cross-Country Canada was
one of the first sport federations to adopt LTAD.
14 SAGE Open
The Role of Social Systems
Social innovations like LTAD are not only dependent on the
attributes of the innovation. The surrounding social system
with its values also influences that capacity of individuals
to adopt and implement the social innovation. All inter-
viewed coaches expressed their views on the sporting cul-
ture in Canada and how its organizational structure limited
LTAD adoption and implementation, as proposed by Sport
Canada. Triathlon coaches involved in swimming and those
in soccer and baseball specifically mentioned how the com-
petitive system in place worked against LTAD. Thus, the
main barrier may be the persistence of a system that empha-
sizes results in competitions at stages where some other
aspects of athletic development would be preferred. In
addition, the outcomes of these competitions are short term,
providing financial and other rewards or support for ath-
letes, which go directly against the principles of LTAD and
discourage its implementation in daily practice for these
coaches. When coaches have to choose between training
orientation (e.g., specialization) that will provide immedi-
ate results and another approach that may take time to pro-
duce results, sport system demands will pull coaching
toward short-term goals. However, the majority of coaches
surveyed adhere to LTAD principles but are in a paradoxi-
cal situation where they cannot afford to reduce short-term
performance because they are immediately accountable. In
fact, as suggested by Côté and Gilbert (2009), the notion of
coaching success is questioned by LTAD. There is a need to
better define what is successful-effective coaching, depend-
ing on athlete levels.
Coaching education also seems to be a factor identified
by coaches as having an influence on whether or not LTAD
will be adopted. Indeed, five coaches, perceiving their
knowledge of LTAD as being less than optimal, had NCCP
Level 1 or 2 certification. However, this observation should
be confirmed in a larger sample. In coaching education on
LTAD, it is clear that different communication channels are
targeted: (a) NCCP training when coaches want to reach
higher levels; (b) attending meetings, workshops, and semi-
nars; (c) sending documentation; or (d) visiting websites
(Table 3). These testimonials suggest that coaching educa-
tion programs should not rely on a single communication
channel. Finally, the clear need for coaching education is to
target LTAD observability by coaches by giving concrete
examples of implementation experienced by them during
NCCP training seminars.
In terms of practical recommendations, sports funding
should be consistent with the sport development model cho-
sen in a given country. Specifically, in Canada, prioritizing
long-term and integrated athletic development and not
merely focusing on short-term results should be targeted to
follow the plan proposed by LTAD. Each sport federation
could develop a set of process goals that could help coaches
follow the progress of their athletes.
Barriers faced by coaches may be addressed through rein-
vention. Many of the barriers faced by coaches created
obstacles to overcome LTAD implementation but did not
bring about its discontinuance. Therefore, an alternative
implementation occurred where coaches implemented only
selected stages of the model (i.e., reinvention). In parallel,
they engaged in ongoing learning to develop better under-
standing of the model and to teach it to others (parents, ath-
letes, assistant coaches).
Rogers (2003) noted that reinvention is a strong indicator
of actual change.All 10 coaches interviewed declared having
implemented LTAD with adaptations, according to the exam-
ples that they provided in interviews. For the coaches in this
study, reinvention of the model within a specific stage of
development gave coaches the opportunity to implement it
despite insufficient information, support, or understanding,
all while keeping the model less complex in their minds. In
studies by Black and Holt (2009) and Frankish etal. (2012),
some coaches similarly used the model for certain stages or
factors only. However, Rogers noted that, in many cases,
reinvention could be judged as good or bad. Indeed, partial
implementation, or not viewing the model as a global vision
of athlete development, could limit coaches from ensuring
that all sports persons were working toward a common goal
for their athletes and safeguarding consistency for athletes'
development no matter what stage they were in.
Rogers (2003) explained that ". . . some reasons for re-
invention lie in the innovation itself, while others involve the
individual or organisation adopting the new idea" (p. 186).
Banack etal. (2012) discussed how the sport context (i.e.,
recreational) could have an impact on the way coaches per-
ceive and adopt the LTAD model in their coaching practices.
Frankish etal. (2012) also determined that coaches in clubs
with different goals and structures perceived the model in
different ways. For example, coaches from competitive clubs
adopted the model more easily than coaches from clubs with
a recreational "Learn to Ski" environment. In addition,
Frankish etal. suggested that a coach's role within the club
could lead to a different path of adoption. Therefore, build-
ing from their research, it was found that coaches perceived
the model and employed it in two main ways: (a) coaches'
perception and knowledge of the model, with barriers to
implementation coming from LTAD itself; and (b) the orga-
nization's inability to properly support the model.
Black and Holt (2009) found inconsistencies in the way
that the LTAD model was implemented in one sport-specific
situation and highlighted the difficulty in evaluating LTAD
implementation. In fact, reinvention of the LTAD model to
the specific needs of different sports is described in both
Frankish's etal. (2012) study on the late-specializing sport
of xc-ski and Lang and Light's (2010) study on the early-
specializing sport of swimming.
While acknowledging that the LTAD model could provide
a common vocabulary for coaches and emphasize the impor-
tance of teaching fundamental skills, Martindale, Collins,
Beaudoin et al. 15
and Daubney (2005) raised concerns regarding its scientific
merit in a study of the LTAD implementation in the United
Kingdom. Similarly, a few coaches in our study expressed
these concerns as potential barriers that created doubts about
the model's rigor. It may explain why some coaches rein-
vented LTAD according to their beliefs, prior knowledge,
and barriers. In fact, reinvention may also be seen crudely as
cherry-picking of concepts from LTAD that they already
know. Indeed, of the few references on LTAD, the majority
underlined that many key LTAD concepts (e.g., perils of
early sport specialization) were already known to some prac-
titioners (Dowling, 2014; Ford etal., 2011). However, other
concepts, like "critical developmental phases," remain non-
evidence based (Ford etal., 2011).
Study Limitations
Interview duration enabled researchers to gain deeper under-
standing of coaches' use of the LTAD model (a total of 287
meaning units analyzed). The views in this article were those of
individual coaches. Rather, the focus was on exploring how
coaches adopted and implemented the model that was presented
to them by Sport Canada. Our study did not address the different
sport contexts of coaches (community, competition, and instruc-
tion) that could influence LTAD model adoption and implemen-
tation. The observations of coaches in their work environment
could have further strengthened the interview data.
Future Research Paths
Further research is warranted to develop a global understand-
ing of how the model is adopted, implemented, and con-
firmed or abandoned over time. The results of our study and
those of others have shown how different sports, sport orga-
nizational structure, training of coaches, and the role of par-
ents are key factors influencing LTAD model adoption and
implementation. Of course, adoption and implementation
processes need to be assessed in other countries where LTAD
is in place. Cultural differences in coaches dealing with
LTAD or other models of performance/participation may
exist and will have to be addressed (Collins etal., 2012).
Conclusion
According to Canadian Sport Policy, the LTAD model is
actually the "paradigm" of Canadian sport (Canadian
Heritage, 2007). So far, 54 Canadian sport governing bodies
have adopted a LTAD framework (Canadian Sport for Life,
2011). Our research identified factors that influence coaches'
adoption and implementation of LTAD or some of its compo-
nents. LTAD, compatible with most coaches' values respect-
ing human development stages, is potentially helpful for
adoption and implementation. The creation of a common
language with other stakeholders is also a point that favors
LTAD adoption and implementation.
Barriers hindering LTAD implementation included (a)
lack of organizational support regarding implementation of
the model, (b) shortage of evidence-based research on the
model, and (c) complexity of the model when viewed in its
entirety, and the difficulty in getting all sports persons
involved in implementing the LTAD model's recommenda-
tions (Figure 1). A sport system gratifying short-term success
is not compatible with the long-term approach of LTAD.
Also, the compatibility of LTAD with sports demanding
early performance development, such as gymnastics, is a
challenge to stakeholders involved in these sports.
Those who implemented LTAD did not necessarily do it
integrally. Many coaches undertook reinvention, or imple-
mented only selected aspects of the model, and consider
LTAD as a set of guidelines without adhering too strictly to
them. This may be ascribed to the fact that parts of LTAD are
evidence based, but the whole approach must be empirically
verified by longitudinal studies.
The model's perceived complexity also stands as an
obstacle for some coaches, particularly with regard to com-
prehension of the transition between development stages,
methods to estimate athletes' stages, and identification of
"windows of opportunity" or critical periods. Therefore, pro-
fessional development regarding LTAD in its entirety (not
just for those stages in which the coaches work), with empha-
sis on philosophical underpinnings of the model and includ-
ing practical ways that coaches can teach others (parents,
other coaches, athletes), must be offered to coaches.
