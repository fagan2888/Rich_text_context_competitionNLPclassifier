Abstract
The production of health policy-relevant research is necessary, but not sufficient, to promote its utilization in policy. Our
objective was to understand the perspectives of United States' state-level policy makers and health researchers on the barriers
and facilitators to the translation of health evidence into the policy process, with a particular focus on issues related to relationship
building. We conducted interviews with 215 US health services and health policy researchers and 40 state-level staffers and
legislators. Researchers and policy makers faced the same major barrier to research translation: lack of dedicated time to do so.
Some policy makers questioned the credibility of research, and researchers questioned policy makers' authentic desire to use
evidence in decision making. For some study participants, a mutual mistrust of the other group challenges stronger relationship
formation. Interventions are needed to help both groups understand a broader role that research plays in policy making and to
increase personal contact, and ultimately trusted relationships, across various actors in the policy process.

Original Research
Introduction
The year 2017 has ushered in a political climate in the United
States where questions about the relevance of scientific
research within a highly politicized policy environment loom
large. Commentators have suggested that research is in dan-
ger of being relegated as less important to the policy-making
process,1 which is particularly concerning after several years
of apparent progress in promoting the translation of evidence
into policy making. The Obama administration was known
for using scientific research in unprecedented ways, such as
in its cross-agency Social and Behavioral Sciences Team to
leverage the insights of behavioral economics to make gov-
ernmental programs work better to solve problems.2 At the
same time, experts and commentators have argued that prog-
ress has been too slow. A 2012 US National Academies of
Science report called for more social science research on the
conditions under which research is used or not in public pol-
icy.3 New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, sparking
debate among the US academic community in a February
2014 column, argued that academics should inject themselves
more seriously into public discourse and policy making.4
Given the current political climate, it is critical to reconsider
a key question: What are the conditions in which research evi-
dence is, or is not, used in health policy-making settings?
Abodyofempiricalresearchinthefieldofknowledgetransfer
and exchange over the last 3 decades seeks to answer this ques-
tion.5 This research relies on surveys and interviews with govern-
ment officials, agency staff, advocates, research institutions, and/
or researchers to investigate the barriers and facilitators to evi-
dence use in policy making.6-12 One synthesis of this research, for
instance, finds that the most prominent barriers include negative
attitudes and mistrust, misaligned incentives, ineffective

communication approaches, and different time horizons between
decision makers and researchers.7 A consistent conclusion in this
general area of research--even a truism, at this point--is that
there are vast differences in the values, worldviews, and profes-
sional routines between policy makers and researchers; these
cultural and relational dissimilarities serve as a roadblock to
effective bidirectional communication.3,13
In the first study to synthesize the fledgling empirical
research on use of data into an organized framework,
Caplan14 described the "two-communities theory" of knowl-
edge translation. He argued that the differing perspectives,
values, and ideologies of researchers compared with govern-
ment officials make their worlds isolated from and mistrust-
ful of the other, which explains low incorporation of research
in policy. Other empirical research supports the notion that
the 2 groups do not sufficiently understand one another, and
that this contributes to communication challenges.15
The major conclusion, then, supported by a wealth of evi-
dence in the field of knowledge transfer, is that building per-
sonal relationships is the most important way to bridge the
"gap" between the 2 communities and ultimately to more
effectively translate research to its end users.8 Studies fre-
quently show, for instance, that personal contact between
researchers and policy makers facilitates greater evidence
use in policy making.15 A recent systematic review found
that increased contact, collaboration, and relationships facili-
tate evidence use in over two-thirds of all studies consid-
ered.16 As a result of this evidence, recommendations for
more effective translation strategies often include facilitating
opportunities for more in-person networking, communica-
tion, and ultimately relationship building--particularly
before a specific decision making need arises--between
researchers and decision makers.7,9,17-19
While there has been much work, as outlined above, on
the barriers researchers face in communicating their research
evidence (ie, lack of training, capacity, time, etc) and the bar-
riers policy makers' face in using it (ie, constituents'
demands, credibility concerns, lack of time, other political
influences), relatively few studies have analyzed relational
factors of both groups simultaneously (although see
Bogenschneider and Corbett's12 work for a notable excep-
tion). Yet examining the attitudes and perspectives of both
researchers and policy makers together is essential for mak-
ing recommendations of how relationships between the two
can be better supported. In addition, since some of the exist-
ing empirical research on evidence in health policy making is
older than the past decade,11,18 drawing conclusions from the
existing body of literature for the current context of health
services and policy research needs may be inappropriate.
The time is ripe for a comprehensive look at researchers'and
policy makers' mutual perceptions, in order to understand
whether and how conditions related to knowledge transfer
have changed in recent years and to identify new recommen-
dations for a political context characterized by uncertainty
over the value of evidence.
Our objective in this study was thus to examine US health
services researchers' and health-related policy makers' per-
ceptions of the role of research evidence in the policy-mak-
ing process and, particularly, their attitudes about each other.
The ultimate aim of this work was to identify recommenda-
tions for future interventions to improve knowledge transla-
tion. These findings and recommendations are important to a
variety of stakeholders, including research funders (such as
the National Institutes of Health and foundations that have
made evidence-based policy a priority, including the W.T.
GrantFoundationandtheLauraandJohnArnoldFoundation),
state governments and legislators (particularly legislative
research functions), universities and university-based centers
that fund and promote research, and intermediary organiza-
tions, such as professional societies for researchers (such as
AcademyHealth) and independent research clearinghouses
(such as blogs like The Incidental Economist).
New Contribution
This qualitative study provided an in-depth assessment of the
commonalities and differences between applied health pol-
icy researchers and policy makers in 2013, focusing particu-
larly on their perspectives toward each other. The results
illuminate sources of potential friction between researchers
and policy makers and identify recommendations for
improved processes of research translation that incorporate
broader perspectives on how scientific evidence can be used
across the policy-making process, not just at the point of
policy decisions.
Data and Methods
Study Participants
In the summer of 2013, we collected data from researchers
and policy makers at the AcademyHealth's Annual Research
Meeting (ARM) and the National Conference of State
Legislatures annual meeting, respectively. AcademyHealth
is the largest gathering of US health policy and health ser-
vices researchers (more details on recruitment and methodol-
ogy are available elsewhere20). The AcademyHealth sample
included 215 health services and health policy researchers
recruited from a random sample of 325 preregistrants for the
2013 AcademyHealth's Annual Research Meeting in
Baltimore, Maryland, in June (66% response). We limited
our sample to researchers whose primary affiliation was an
academic institution. We sent each of the 325 registrants an
invitation to be interviewed at the meeting along with a $2
incentive. We sent a follow-up e-mail to schedule interviews
with responders, and we contacted nonresponders 2 addi-
tional times by e-mail. Interviews were conducted by trained
research assistants in a designated meeting area. Twenty-
eight participants were unable to complete the interview dur-
ing the meeting and were interviewed by telephone.
Gollust et al 3
The second sample included legislators and legislative
staff attending the National Conference of State Legislatures'
annual Legislative Summit in August 2013 in Atlanta, GA.
The Summit is the largest national gathering of state-level
legislators. Our sample was limited to legislators and legisla-
tive staff from the United States who focused on health and/
or human services issues. Inclusion in the study was based on
confirmation of role as legislator or legislative staff by inter-
view, and a total of 43 policy makers participated. Because
these were intercept interviews solicited as they attended
conference sessions (ie, no formal sampling frame), we
report no response rate.
Consent was obtained prior to all interviews. Participants
were entered in raffles for a $200 retail gift card. The study
was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional
Review Board.
Interview Instruments
The 2 instruments were designed to identify researchers' and
policy makers' professional activities related to the dissemi-
nation of and use of research in the policy-making process.
For the researcher sample, researchers first answered a struc-
tured (quantitative) survey instrument (with results previ-
ously reported20). Then they were asked several open-ended
interview questions concerning activities they engaged in
related to the dissemination of their own research. The inter-
view instruments for policy makers were solely qualitative.
Policy makers were asked to describe specific activities they
engaged in related to finding and using research evidence in
the policy-making process, with probes related to their use of
social media. The open-ended question that is the focus of
this analysis for the researcher sample was, "What is the big-
gest challenge as a researcher to influencing policy?" The
open-ended question that is the focus of the analysis for the
policy maker sample was, "What do you see as the biggest
challenge to using research evidence in health policy?"
Analysis
All interviews were transcribed and de-identified. First, all
members of the author team discussed a small set (N = 5) of
transcripts from both groups. Through this inductive process,
we identified the main emergent themes, mentions of chal-
lenges and barriers to translation, best practices for finding
and/or communicating research (how it is accessed, how it is
communicated, and by whom), characteristics of the policy-
making process, and differences between researchers and
policy makers. While many themes were identified in both
researchers' and policy makers' transcripts, others were
unique to one group (such as "credibility of science," which
emerged only in the policy maker sample). These themes
comprised the initial codes in our codebook; additional
themes were identified and added to the coding scheme as
needed in a pilot coding process led by 3 of the authors.
Before coding all transcripts, a subset of transcripts were
double-coded to ensure interrater reliability. Disagreement
was reconciled and agreement exceeded 90%. Next, 2
authors coded all transcripts using the final codebook in
NVivo 10.0. After all codes were entered, the study team cre-
ated analysis memos for all codes, describing the major
themes under each code, key outliers, and a comprehensive
list of illustrative quotes. Through a comparative method, the
team analyzed all the researcher and policy-maker memos
for consistency and disagreement. We also examined differ-
ences in themes for researchers by their academic rank
(assistant, associate, full professors) and for policy makers
by whether they were elected legislators or staff. Differences
in these characteristics did not stand out as important and so
we report the findings at the level of the group as a whole.
For the purposes of the present analysis which seeks to illu-
minate the role of relationships in research translation, we
focused our results on the barriers and facilitators of research
translation and attitudes relevant to relationships between
researchers and policy makers.
Results
Table 1 describes the characteristics of the 215 researcher
participants and 43 policy maker (32 legislators, 11 staff)
participants. There were more female than male researchers,
while the policy maker sample was nearly three-fourths
male. The largest group (44%) of researchers were within the
first 10 years of degree; similarly, the largest group (32%) of
policy makers had been in their position for 6 to 10 years.
The policy maker sample was well represented across parti-
san groups, with somewhat more Democrats (47%) than
Republicans (33%), with the remainder nonpartisan (for
staff) or unknown.
The analysis generated 4 broad findings related to policy
makers' and researchers' perceptions of one another and of
use of evidence in policy making (see summary in Table 2).
First, despite coming from different professional back-
grounds, both groups faced consistent barriers to communi-
cating and using research effectively, barriers that impede
efforts to build relationships across groups. Second, the 2
groups had varying perspectives on the value of research in
policy making, with a high degree of cynicism on the role of
evidence in policy making expressed by both groups. Third,
for some study participants, negative perspectives about the
use of research in policy making corresponded with a
strongly expressed mistrust toward the other group. Fourth,
both groups described a mismatch between the needs of pol-
icy makers and the approaches taken by researchers.
Consistent Barriers
Researchers and policy makers were consistent in their
acknowledgment of the main barriers that prevent research
from being communicated to, and used by, policy makers.
4 INQUIRY
Specifically, researchers most commonly identified compet-
ing demands on their time that limited their ability to com-
municate science to policy makers. Many researchers noted
that the current expectations of the tenure and promotion
process are not compatible with taking the time to engage
with policy makers. As one respondent said,
if you want to do research there's time constraints, so if you're
working on dissemination then you're not doing research, and if
you want to do research, which is why you're in the business
probably, it's a time cost, and there's no promotional incentive
within the university promotions structure to do that.
For their part, policy makers also most frequently identi-
fied being very busy as a reason they do not access research
information more routinely, saying, for instance, "As citizen
legislators, a time constraint is our biggest problem." Many
felt overwhelmed by the amount of information that they
were expected to process, receiving reports and other infor-
mation daily. Like researchers, they faced hard constraints in
their ability to absorb research into the policy work that they
do. Several policy makers, in addition to commenting on the
deluge of information they receive, also mentioned difficulty
finding the "right" information for their needs.
Another consistent barrier cited by both groups was that
researchers do not understand the policy process sufficiently.
Researchers acknowledged that the linear model they may
have been taught whereby research gets created in academia
(detached from the policy context) and then the results subse-
quently communicated to the policy setting to be used at the
point of decision making is wrong and potentially misleading.
A few researchers explicitly stated that some of their peers
erroneously presume that policy makers are "rational decision
makers working in a very logical stepwise fashion." This mis-
understanding of the policy process contributes to researchers'
feelings of frustration about or alienation by the policy pro-
cess, and also leads them to misjudge their likelihood of influ-
ence. As one stated, "A lot of researchers, especially early
career researchers, think that all they have to do is tell the truth
and powers will listen and that just doesn't happen."
Policy makers also expressed frustration with researchers'
seemingly naive perceptions of the policy process, which,
they argued, leads to ineffective communication approaches.
As one policy maker indicated,

I've seen a lot of academics come in prepared to teach. No, no.
This is not a teachable moment, okay? You've got to explain, got
to develop credibility, but much more quickly than that. And
then you've got to hit the ground with things that legislators can
really figure out and understand.
Policy makers also mentioned that researchers commonly
use strategies that belie their lack of understanding of policy-
making processes, such as not using constituents as messen-
gers of research and sending too lengthy reports.
Attitudes About the Value and Credibility of
Research in Policy Making
More than half of policy makers stated explicitly that they
believed research has value in their policy work. They think
research has value because it "can cross party lines" and that
they have a responsibility to approach tough problems using
the most effective mechanisms. In contrast, a single outlier
(an elected official) explicitly questioned whether research is
valuable, commenting that policy makers may just want to
please academics by saying that research has value. He
reacted against the notion that research should have an ele-
vated influence in policy making over other factors, com-
menting that this was antidemocratic: "Who elected those
institutions of higher education to do the research? Who
elected them to tell us what to do?"
Policy makers considered research evidence to be a com-
ponent of politics, not removed from it. They did not per-
ceive research evidence as neutral, but considered it
potentially politicized just as any information in the political
process might be. As one stated, "Most of the information
that comes to legislators is not pure science data. It's typi-
cally biased, and so you have to take the time to figure out
who is publishing the article and what their agenda might
be." Another indicated that data were used for political per-
suasion: "Both sides have statistics."
Most policy makers expressed concern about potential
bias among researchers, sponsors, and funders; 25 elected
officials and 9 staffers raised the point that science is not
always credible. This concern mostly stemmed from unease
about funding and interest groups; for instance, citing an
experience with research about indoor tanning, a policy
maker stated, "You have to be a critical reader and think
about who's really driving this. Are you gonna trust that the
people who are just studying this etiology of this increase in
melanoma don't have anything against tanning booths?"
Others mentioned that research is necessarily a mix of higher
and lower quality work, with demands on researchers to be
prolific. In assessing research credibility, policy makers
mentioned details as specific as study sample size and gener-
alizability issues as well as more general concerns about
researchers' interpretation and advocacy for a particular per-
spective. As one policy maker stated, "The numbers can say
what you want them to say." Concern over the credibility of
science contributed to hesitancy about the misuse of research
in decision making, as a policy maker voiced:
I see the biggest challenge is [policy makers] not knowing how
to read and judge research. They don't know: if someone comes

up with something that's very politicized, but someone can say
anything, right, it's a free country. But [policy makers] don't
ask, is it in a peer reviewed journal? Has the result been
replicated? Can you tell me where to find that?
Researchers perceived that policy makers may not seri-
ously care about research, but unlike the policy makers--
who frequently discussed the politicization of science and
evidence--researchers infrequently identified concerns
about bias in research. In contrast, they often characterized
the nonresearch-related factors that go into policy as
"biased." As one described,
I think there are a lot of biases, that people approach policy
making from the perspective of what seems most accessible,
what seems most important to you, based on what your
constituents are telling you, based on what's in the media, and it
can be very biased.
Researchers were cynical about policy makers' authenticity
in their consideration of research in their decisions, relative
to political considerations like lobbyists' and constituents'
influence; several noted this concern has only gotten worse
in recent years with heightened politicization of health pol-
icy issues as well as more politically polarized legislatures.
As one said,
I would say it's, the political process is . . . it feels like a
completely separate world and it's very much out of our control.
So the best we can do as researchers is do the best science
possible and though we have very little control over how it will
be used.
Some researchers acknowledged that this cynicism about the
political process could drive researchers away from wanting
to even engage in research translation, because "it might
seem like a waste of time to get too closely involved." Few
researchers shared the dominant view among policy makers
that research should be carefully critiqued. An outlier, one
researcher made the point (as did the policy makers) that
research can be "good, bad, and ugly" and that researchers
sometimes push out research that aligns with a particular per-
spective; this researcher suggested that policy makers not
"jump to every little thing that researchers find."
Mutual Mistrust
Some policy makers' and researchers' cautious attitudes
about research use in policy making went beyond a "healthy
cynicism" of research influence in policy making (such as
scrutinizing research funding or sources, and being aware of
the nonevidentiary yet important influences in the political
process). In fact, a strong and vocal mistrust emerged from
some policy makers in their perceptions of academic
research; a strength of mistrust that was matched in some
researchers' perceptions of policy makers.
Some policy makers believed that research is manipulated
to be persuasive:
I would also say that it is a challenge where people are trying to
persuade other people, you get into cases where some people are
presenting information that is out of context or not properly
supported by a well-designed research, and it's more zealotry
than factual conclusions.
Policy makers' distrust of research was based in concerns
regarding the academic setting. A small number of policy
makers made statements that academic institutions care more
about seeking publicity or funding than promoting the com-
mon good. One participant noted,
I think sometimes universities will, you know, affiliate
themselves with--or allow the relationship to continue because
there's publicity involved for the institution. Although it may
not--the underlying level of credibility of the work that's
actually being done may not be all that good.
Two mentioned a concern about "liberal bias" of universities.
Some policy makers negatively noted the influence of
funding on research. As one policy maker said, "You will see
articles published, and at the end, even though it doesn't say
it in the article . . . you're left going, all they're looking for is
additional funding for whatever project they're looking for."
One researcher also described this perspective, acknowledg-
ing that academic institutions and the researchers within
them often face incentives to generate fundable research, not
actionable research:
If you're in an academic setting, I think the idea that for
tenure, the hurdles that are put up for tenure, they may not be
that interested in research that has to do with policy change,
they may be more interested in research that brings in big
dollars.
On the contrary, some researchers believed that policy
makers were more strongly influenced by money than scien-
tific evidence. One researcher said, "Well, you know unfor-
tunately a lot of policy makers don't base policy on truth and
reason. They base it on ideology and the interests of the pow-
erful people who pay for their campaigns." A few others sug-
gested that politicians are not open to hearing about a
particular research finding because they have predisposing
policy ideas they want to pursue, which leads to a censoring
of evidence (as one said: "If you're finding something not in
line with what they want, they will not even put it out there.")
Expressing a high degree of mistrust, one researcher said:
"Policy makers really don't care about what the researcher
says. They just care about who's paying their bill." A large
group of researchers, however, acknowledged that policy
makers may not use research as a result of the policy makers'
busy schedule and time constraints, rather than a willful non-
use of research.
Gollust et al 7
Finally, one policy maker--albeit an outlier in how vocal
he was in his distrust of researchers--believed that research-
ers are arrogant and "belittle" policy makers for not having
sufficient knowledge: "You're saying I can't get in the weeds
in the nuances--because [researchers are] so smart that the
legislators just don't understand?" A single researcher's
comments actually supported this belief, saying, "We're on
an intellectual plane that is so different from what plane the
policy makers are on."
Mismatch Between Needs of Policy Makers and
Actions of Researchers
When solutions to facilitate more research translation were
offered in the interviews, researchers and policy makers both
described some best practices in communicating research
and in finding or using research. Both groups talked about
the importance of keeping research findings brief, action-
able, and to transmit them using credible messengers. Policy
makers frequently noted that the best way to find "good sci-
ence" is to get it from credible people and organizations. As
one participant said,
You know, no one's just gonna read someone I've never heard
of. Now if you get to be known enough, like if maybe some
professional at a university where I live that I know are very
knowledgeable . . . there's a credibility there . . . I've seen the
track of where they're going and I agree with the thinking.
Or as another confirmed, "So if someone I know and
respect in [home state] can explain or bring me a piece of
research and put into the vernacular, it's going to be better
because I can ask questions about it." Many relied on indi-
viduals they already knew well to provide information
when needed. One elected official said, "Actually, my own
physician wanted to--there was a piece of legislation that
he was very interested in, and so he came to the legislature
and testified."
Policy makers noted that credibility can come not just
from the individual researcher but also the institution or
organization that can help communicate the research,
including local universities, hospitals within their district,
and intermediary organizations like the National Conference
of State Legislators, Pew, and Council of State Governments.
Many policy makers noted that they find the most trustwor-
thy sources of research from their internal contacts--their
own staff, committees, and legislative research branches.
After pursuing these internal channels, legislators and staff-
ers noted that local researchers are the best sources of
research, especially via in-person meetings (noted by half of
the 24 policy makers who mentioned a specific preferred
communication channel). As one policy maker noted, "I
think, at least in our legislature, reaching out and making it
that individual contact is probably the best but most
time-consuming."
While not a majority, some researchers also recognized
that forming relationships with policy makers could be effec-
tive and some were indeed interested in building relation-
ships and using alternative forms of communication,
including face-to-face meetings. Sometimes, though,
researchers did not know the best way to connect with policy
makers. Some noted that traditional scholarly channels were
not effective, saying, "I don't think those high impact factor
journals are making the impact they used to make because
people are going so many other places. And I don't think the
policy makers are necessarily going to those journals."
However, few felt prepared to disseminate effectively using
alternative mechanisms. One spoke to a lack of dissemina-
tion training: "Writing policy briefs is something that we
don't get a lot of training in and we don't have a lot of atten-
tion towards." With regard to forging relationships on a per-
sonal level with policy makers, researchers noted 3 major
challenges. The first was that they are not necessarily work-
ing in a single field, so the people with whom they would
need to cultivate relationships would frequently change (ie,
across a topic area like Medicaid or long-term care); they
also reinforced the lack of time they have to cultivate rela-
tionships; and they noted that the "interesting questions" that
policy makers might pose may not have funding attached to
them, so researchers cannot add this to their workload when
they have other pressing research grants and obligations. So
while most researchers understood the need to modify their
typical formats and channels of communication to meet pol-
icy makers where they are, the researchers on a whole did not
demonstrate much interest in doing so given their profes-
sional constraints and, as mentioned at the outset, extreme
time pressures.
Social Media as a Possible Bridge Between
Worlds?
Policy makers and researchers alike viewed social media
with ambivalence. Policy makers, supporting their perspec-
tive that face-to-face is best, indicated that social media
would be unlikely to overcome the need for trusted relation-
ships. As one said, "I would rather speak with a person one-
on-one than through Twitter." On the contrary, there were a
few positive outliers in the policy maker sample who noted
using Twitter as a method for identifying topics of interest
related to research:
I read linked articles off of Twitter. So if something grabs my
attention that this just published about X, Y, Z topic, I'll go read
it. I read off of that more than I do out of my newspapers or
anything else.
Researchers, too (as noted in more detail elsewhere),20 were
ambivalent that social media like Twitter could be an effec-
tive mode for communicating research results, and were con-
cerned that it might not actually reach policy makers, that it
8 INQUIRY
could force researchers to "dumb down" their message, and
that it could lead to reputational consequences if messages
are not carefully constructed (ideally by others who take this
communication function on as a designated responsibility).
Discussion
These findings do not paint a particularly sanguine picture of
the potential connections between research and policy mak-
ing that would, as knowledge transfer research suggests, lead
to more effective translation. The notion that researchers and
policy makers reside in "two communities"14--first articu-
lated in 1979--seems alive and well almost 35 years later, as
expressed in strikingly explicit terms among both research-
ers and policy makers in 2013. This suggests little change
since some of the earliest studies on knowledge transfer first
identified mistrust as a major barrier to effective research
translation. Innvaer and colleagues described "perceived
political naivety of scientists and scientific naivety of
policymakers"15(p241) as a barrier identified in 8 of 24 empiri-
cal papers. It was surprising to observe such overt mistrust
expressed on both sides particularly among a group of rela-
tively applied health researchers and health-informed policy
makers. Given that these results from 2013 suggest strong
degrees of underlying mistrust, as the broader context of
politics shifts toward heightened scrutiny of science, one
could anticipate even more vocal mistrust in 2017. Social
psychological research suggests that predisposing negative
beliefs can lead to the amplification of differences and
enhanced polarization in perspectives.21
Both policy makers and researchers held strong negative
perceptions and misunderstandings of the other, attitudes
that would challenge the formation of stronger relationships.
Most important, they differed in how they thought about the
very concept of "research." Policy makers think of research
as routinely "biased," used to support one perspective, and a
part of the political persuasion process. This perception
likely follows from how they mostly interact with research:
through the testimony process as presented by lobbyists and
interest groups on one side or the other of a legislative debate.
A negative perception of academic institutions as biased also
contributed to negative perspectives on scientific credibility.
Researchers, not surprisingly, viewed research as objective,
and privileged research normatively as an important influ-
ence in policy making; they expressed disillusionment when
research was not used in policy decisions given the host of
other influences on policy making --from financial influ-
ences to constituent demands to political agendas and
coalitions.
Both of these perceptions--of research as biased or of
political decisions as overly influenced by nonevidentiary
factors--rely on an incomplete and inaccurate perspective
on the role of research in policy making. Both groups per-
ceived research as being most relevant at the point of a deci-
sion about some policy matter, an "instrumental use" of
evidence, to apply Carol Weiss's classic 1979 typology.22
Rarely did study participants discuss how research might be
used in setting the agenda for what is important, in framing
the importance of policy problems, or in providing context
for understanding issues, all more common uses of research
in policy making.6 For both groups in our study, their "top of
the head" conception of what it means to use research in
policy meant decision making during legislative debate. This
overemphasis on the instrumental application of data or evi-
dence into decision making is hardly new; Nathan Caplan
critiqued this view as "an image of reality too narrow to pro-
vide a suitable foundation on which to premise decisions
involving the more important policy issues."14 Similarly, UK
scholar Katherine Smith suggests that the ideas or concepts
that emerge from public health have indeed shaped policy in
numerous ways, but a narrow conception of research evi-
dence would suggest otherwise.23 Because both researchers
and policy makers in our study still hewed to an instrumental
conception of research use in policy making (and then were
either disappointed in its nonuse or alienated by its seem-
ingly politicized use), broader exposure to the many ways in
which research might have a role in policy making is needed,
as described below.
While the dominant finding of this study concerns the
high mutual mistrust expressed by researchers and policy
makers, the two groups also faced similar constraints and
barriers that could be used to forge more common ground
between researchers and policy makers and also inform the
creation and implementation of interventions. This study
makes clear, for instance, that any intervention to communi-
cate research would need to account for the fact that both
groups are vastly overcommitted in the time resources they
have available. Thus, efforts to convene the groups together
need to carefully account for scheduling issues in order to be
successful and also recognize that their often-contradictory
perceptions and beliefs would need to be carefully navigated
by those convening the groups (see, eg, Kerr et al19).
Recommendations and Future Directions
The similarity between findings in this study and the level of
mistrust demonstrated in research on this topic 20 or more
years ago15,16 suggests gaps in knowledge translation are
unlikely to improve organically. Indeed, while "build rela-
tionships" has been the dominant recommendation in the lit-
erature, our study suggests that this conclusion may be
simplistic and insufficient. Active investment and interven-
tions are needed to infuse evidence into multiple points in the
policy process across a wider range of actors. Below, we
focus our recommendations on those in the research and
intermediary communities.
First, others have recommended that researchers need
training in dissemination and in policy making,24 and indeed
our work supports this. But specifically, training opportuni-
ties must describe the spectrum of ways that research can
Gollust et al 9
influence policy making: from prioritizing the importance
of various health problems, to identifying what issues can/
should be framed as policy problems where government has
a role to play, supporting a particular type of policy approach,
and evaluating the effects of policies after they are imple-
mented (including their effects on behavioral outcomes, cost
outcomes, and on more abstract outcomes such as citizens'
attitudes and beliefs). In addition, researchers need more
training in policy making so they can appreciate the nonlin-
earities of the policy process and understand what politics
is, rather than something to be wary of. This is consistent
with the US National Academies report, which urged for
training among policy analysts and evaluators to incorporate
social science findings on the conditions under which
research is and is not used in policy making, rather than a
more traditional education which privileges the value of sci-
entific evidence over other decision-making modalities.3 A
deeper understanding of politics and policy making can illu-
minate more potential points of engagement and intersec-
tion, so researchers move beyond an inaccurate (and
self-defeating) linear model that proposes research produc-
tion on one end and decision making on the other, as implied
by a problem framed as "two communities."25 In fact, there
are numerous other points of interaction and intermediaries,
from media to advocates to interest groups, all of whom can
establish relationships with researchers and with policy
makers and interact at various points throughout the nonlin-
ear policy process.23
Second, research institutions should take on more active
roles in translation and reducing barriers for researchers.26
Universities and their dedicated policy-related centers can
be engaged in more active outreach, relationship building
with policy makers (and those trusted by policy makers,
such as important advocates), learning who the appropriate
committee staff are in state or local policy bodies, and
other opportunities to forge personal relationships.19 These
investments are laborious, and as our findings make clear,
individual researchers rarely can invest the type of time
and energy needed. At one of our institutions, a health pol-
icy institute (Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics)
has developed a robust translation and dissemination pro-
gram that relies on joint efforts of staff and faculty. Staff
prepare briefs summarizing individual research publica-
tions and synthesize research related to policy areas--
sometimes even engaging faculty outside of the institution.
Twitter is used to build social media dissemination net-
works. A blog serves as a vehicle to deliver expert com-
mentary. Conferences and forums focused on specific
topics (eg, health insurance exchanges) help build personal
relationships with policy makers. In addition, policy insti-
tutes can play another important role. In our prior
research20we found that researchers value having third par-
ties promote their research to avoid perceptions of "self-
promotion"-- a concern that we found to be common
among academic researchers. All of these efforts require
substantial resources and the traditional model of grant-
based funding for research is often not aligned with these
efforts. To effectively serve the needs of the public, univer-
sities and funders will need to identify strategies to fund
these efforts--possibly through more dedicated funding
written into individual grants, philanthropy, or other mech-
anisms through institutional budgets.
Third, research institutions should evaluate whether ten-
ure and promotion standards sufficiently prioritize and rec-
ognize public communication and policy impact. New
measures of research visibility and impact such as Altmetric
scores are being used more frequently by journals. However,
we are not aware of many academic institutions using mea-
sures of public visibility when evaluating faculty for tenure.
The American Sociological Association recently recom-
mended that public impact be explicitly included as tenure
criteria, to be measured by, for instance, soliciting letters
from entities outside of academia to provide testimony as to
the policy impact of scholars'work.27 If evaluation standards
change, faculty would have more direct incentive to engage
policy makers and these activities would become normative
in the research community.
Fourth, individual researchers who are especially com-
mitted to having impact (and who have institutional support,
as described above) should adopt research approaches that
connect policy makers, researchers, and intermediaries.
Commentators have suggested various research approaches
that apply knowledge transfer models directly into their
design, such as models of exchange or "strategic science,"
but with maintaining scientific rigor and integrity.28,29 As an
example, the new US-based Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation program Interdisciplinary Research Leaders
connects researchers and community leaders from the begin-
ning with the goal of producing research that, by design, will
have greater impact. Funders that care about their return on
research investment should be encouraged to issue similar
calls for proposals that prioritize action and dissemination
and thus help to transform researchers' traditional designs
from investigator-initiated to research designs that have early
and substantial policy maker and practitioner input.
Fifth, more research is needed to identify effective pro-
cesses for promoting stronger linkages between researchers
and policy makers and to evaluate both translation mecha-
nisms and relationships. The knowledge exchange field
should move beyond describing the problem (such as in the
current study) to implementing and evaluating solutions.
Such interventions, and their evaluations, should be devel-
oped in partnerships among researchers, intermediaries, and
policy maker end users. As a simple intervention, researchers
can experiment with different approaches to presenting
research on a particular topic.30 More complicated, multi-
phase interventions based on behavioral change theory might
be designed and tested with both researcher communities and
policy maker communities (government agencies, elected
officials, or staff) to determine how best to shift behaviors of
10 INQUIRY
all actors involved toward greater communication and incor-
poration of research. A notable example of this is the ongoing
Supporting Policy In health with Research: an Intervention
Trial (SPIRIT).31 This study is a randomized trial involving 6
health policy agencies in Australia, and employs multiple
interventions (audit feedback, training, supportive assistance,
information exchange with researchers) with the goal of
increasing agency capacity to use research evidence in their
programs and ultimately more seeking out and use of scien-
tific evidence.31 Of course, other evaluation designs beyond
randomized trials are also needed to assess the output of vary-
ing research-policy partnerships. Moreover, preliminary
descriptive research such as developing and testing outcome
measures like metrics of research use or research impact on
policy making will also help push the knowledge transfer
field forward.
Sixth, technologies such as social media have some
appealing qualities: a low-resource-intensive, and poten-
tially quick fix for communicating research evidence and
connecting--albeit via virtual networks--with policy
makers.20,32 However, our study revealed ambivalence on
both sides about the value (in 2013) of social media. State
policy makers voiced their preference for face-to-face com-
munication, and while some users of social networking
sites may indeed interact in relationship-building ways, it
remains an empirical question whether and how virtual
social networks can substitute for "real" interactions in the
policy process as well as whether researchers and their
institutions are meaningfully connected with the appropri-
ate end users of evidence. In addition, while tweeting and
posting may seem to be efficient in terms of time (they are
short communications, after all), crafting the right message
at the right time and curating the research information takes
strategic attention.
While this research has illuminated some concerns, our
findings should not be interpreted to signify that change is
required for all researchers or all policy makers; nor are
researchers or policy makers the only appropriate targets for
change. Some researchers conducting more basic health ser-
vices research do not have interest in or capacity to translate
their work themselves and may not need to change their
approach, just as policy makers do not necessarily need to
change their behaviors or relationships to make better policy.
This study confirms the importance of other intermediaries
or knowledge brokers as the focus for intervention,33 espe-
cially those who are already trusted by policy makers.
Moving high-quality research syntheses into the hands of
advocates, lobbyists, journalists, or other similar knowledge
brokers might be a more scientifically valid and politically
successful approach than trying to make the individual
researcher the messenger of discrete study findings. As men-
tioned above, future research in knowledge transfer in health
policy should consider more sophisticated models of the
policy process and multiple "communities" of study (see, eg,
critiques in Smith23).
Limitations
Our research had several limitations. First, policy maker
study participants were recruited using a convenience sam-
ple of legislators and legislative staff attending the National
Conference of State Legislatures'annual Legislative Summit,
and researcher participants were recruited from a random
sample of university health services and health policy
researchers attending the AcademyHealth's Annual Research
Meetings. Researchers and policy makers attending these
meetings may not be representative of researchers and policy
makers overall. Researchers attending the meeting have an
applied focus which would lead them to have more, not less,
interest in translation to policy settings. Similarly, policy
makers in the study were all attending the Summit and thus
have at least some interest in using evidence to inform policy
making; as state-level policy makers, they are unlikely to
reflect the views of policy makers at the local or federal
level. In contrast, the researcher participants were drawn at
random from a sampling frame, and so we are relatively con-
fident that the researcher sample is representative of this
population. That said, health services research is only one
type of research relevant to health policy decision making. It
will be important to assess the behaviors and attitudes of
researchers in nonhealth fields that have health policy rele-
vance (eg, education, transportation, housing) as well.
Second, we relied on self-report to measure attitudes as
well as information translation and information-seeking
behaviors. This method could be susceptible to recall or
social desirability bias. However, both groups discussed their
distrust and hesitancy openly; if their responses were socially
biased, we would have anticipated them to present warmer
attitudes toward researchers (for policy makers) and more
enthusiasm about evidence translation and policy impact (for
researchers). Other methodologies--such as examining
institutional guidelines for tenure and promotion, or examin-
ing hearing testimony for documentation of research evi-
dence--together could triangulate the barriers and facilitators
that both groups face.
Conclusions
Our study provides a sobering view on the potential for
researchers and policy makers to form relationships. Given
the constraints and incentives both sides face, overcoming
the distance between researchers and policy makers is
extremely challenging, and simple approaches will not be
sufficient. Multilevel approaches that expand the role and
capacity of intermediaries might include the active support
of research institutions, the development, implementation,
and evaluation of strategic interventions, as well as more rec-
ognition and use of the range of policy actors from advocates
to journalists. Relationship building across this greater set of
actors is key to overcoming the persistent divides that have
long plagued the research and policy communities.
