Introduction
The effect of a criminal history and race on employment
opportunities is well documented by Pager (2003), Pager and
Quillian (2005), and Pager, Bonikowski, and Western (2009).
The literature describes the effect discrimination has on
employment opportunities and future earnings of minorities
and ex-offenders (Holzer, 2011; O'Neill & O'Neill, 2011;
Pager et al., 2009; Riach & Rich, 2010; Sites & Parks, 2011).
Some investigations into employment discrimination involved
the use of statistical analysis of comparisons of wages between
minorities and White employees (Bendick, Jackson, &
Reinoso, 1994; Daniel, 1997; McGinnity & Lunn, 2011;
Schwieren, 2012; Stepanikova, 2012. Tomaskovic-Devey &
Skaggs, 1999, Veenman, 2010).
Pager (2003) and Pager and Quillian (2005) used field
experiments with matched pairs of testers to examine the
natural environment for the gathering of data and informa-
tion regarding employment discrimination. Pager found a
significant effect of race in the findings in Milwaukee and
New York. Only 14% of Blacks received callbacks compared
with 34% of White noncriminals (p < .01).
Veenman (2010) encouraged the use of triangulation of
research methods when examining employment discrimina-
tion. Veenman argued that one method is not superior to the
other. Furthermore, one compensates for the weakness of the
other and vice versa. Veenman argued each methodology
during triangulation could produce different information
regarding employment discrimination. Guion, Diehl, and
McDonald (2011) described triangulation as the use of mul-
tiple sources, or locations, or researchers in the analysis pro-
cess. In the present research, the researcher (the researcher,
unpublished) used a field experiment with testers, a tele-
phone survey, and the diary entries of the testers to examine
employment discrimination for entry-level positions in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The following research examined
the role of gatekeepers in the application process for entry-
level positions in the labor market of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
An added feature of the present research is the testers were
required to maintain a diary of their interactions with the
gatekeepers during the application process.
Literature Review
The dramatic role of the gatekeepers has been examined at
different levels of organizations. Mitchell (2003) defined a
gatekeeper as anyone who stands between you and the person
who might want to hire you. Mitchell suggested gatekeepers
can be receptionists, HR recruiters, and resume screeners.

Gatekeepers: The Milwaukee Field
Experiment in the Employment
Application Process
Lenard Wells1
Abstract
Criminal history and race have been prominent figures in the research of discrimination in the labor market. Initially there
was a heavy reliance on statistical analysis of employment data as an indicator of bias in employment. The use of field
experiments that use audits conducted by testers applying for entry-level positions has become an important resource in the
examination of discrimination in the labor force. The testers are matched on all characteristics, but race. In the present study,
evidence of discrimination relied heavily on a comparison of callbacks for entry-level positions of Black male and White male
testers based on their race and criminal history. Testers were required to participate in debriefings and maintain a diary of
all of their interactions during the application process. Three themes emerged from the diaries and debriefings of the testers:
(a) the application process was influenced by a "gatekeeper," (b) racism was evident, and (c) an emotional effect was noted
on both testers.

Columbaro and Monaghan (2009) conducted a literature
review regarding the effect of the gatekeeper perceptions of
online degrees and employment. They suggested that employ-
ers' gatekeepers preferred someone with a degree from a tra-
ditional learning environment. Therefore, the employers'
gatekeepers negative perception of online degrees was a bar-
rier to hiring.
According to Hammersley and Atkinson (1995), the gate-
keeper plays a prominent role in the communication process
of organizations. It was suggested that the degree of author-
ity possessed by the gatekeeper is not necessarily an accurate
reflection of their influence on the decision-making process.
Morrill, Buller, Buller, and Larkey (1999) suggested that
the individual gatekeepers in an organization can be elusive.
Morrill et al. argued that it is frequently a challenge to iden-
tify them. Ruth-McSwain (2011) examined the influence of
public relations practitioners as gatekeepers to the news in
organizations. One of the findings included that the gate-
keeper influenced the decision-making process of their orga-
nizations. Ruth-McSwain argued that the gatekeeper had a
role in their organization's communication with the news
media and other external sources. Furthermore, the use and
influence of the gatekeeper authority in filtering communica-
tion was evident at multiple levels of an organization.
The growing concern regarding gatekeepers in the appli-
cation process resulted in the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) to implement new federal guidelines
regarding the use of a criminal history in the early stages of
the employment process (Berrien, 2012). The new guidelines
were implemented to show disapproval of criminal histories
being abused as a barrier to employment. EEOC added spe-
cific reference to the "Timing" of the use of criminal history
in the application process. EEOC suggested that the questions
regarding criminal history should be eliminated from the
application form. Furthermore, the questions regarding crimi-
nal history should be reserved until the interview process.
Other decision makers came to similar conclusions
regarding the potential abuse of criminal history records in
denying employment. Some cities, counties, and states
enacted laws to discourage the use of criminal history checks
on applications (Oberstein & Gilbreth, 2010). Oberstein and
Gilbreth (2010) reported on the measures taken by the state
of Massachusetts to ban criminal history inquiries on job
application forms. The ban does not prohibit criminal history
inquiries later in the application process.
Background of the Study
The researcher (unpublished) used a field experiment to
examine the effect of a criminal history and race on employ-
ment in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin labor market. The field
experiments used two testers (one Black male and one White
male) to audit 30 employers who were randomly divided into
two categories: Criminal Record (CR) and No Criminal
Record (NCR) job sites. The two testers were matched in all
characteristics except race. Each tester was required to main-
tain a diary of the application process experience.
Data were collected on the number of callbacks and inter-
views received by each tester. A telephone survey was con-
ducted to allow the employers of the audit to express their
willingness to hire disadvantaged workers. Similar to the
field experiments of Pager (2003) and Pager and Quillian
(2005), a dramatic disparity exists between the callbacks of
the Black male tester and the White male tester (the
researcher, unpublished). The Black male tester received no
callbacks when applying at CR job sites. The White male
tester received 40% of his callbacks from the CR job sites.
Moreover, the Black male received 27% of his callbacks
from NCR job sites compared with the White male's 47%.
According to the researcher (unpublished), the telephone
survey of the same employers indicated a willingness to hire
both ex-offenders regardless of their race, yet the audit
revealed the opposite.
The diary entries of the testers were subjected to com-
parative analysis (the researcher, unpublished). Three themes
emerged from the diary entries and debriefings: (a) the appli-
cation process was influenced in the favor of the White male
applicant by the "gatekeepers," (b) racism was evident, and
(c) an emotional effect was noted on both testers.
Research Rationale--Diary
The purpose of the present report is to examine the emerging
themes from the testers' diaries and debriefings. During the
field experiment, each tester maintained a diary of his inter-
actions with the employers. The testers recorded their inter-
actions with the employer or representative immediately
after leaving the premises. They recorded the day, date, time,
and location in their diary. They also recorded their conver-
sations with the employer or representative at each site, as
well as a physical description of each. Furthermore, they
recorded the approximate age, build, hair color, and other
characteristics to assist in identifying the individuals.
Constant comparative analysis was used to obtain data
relevant to the testers' interaction with the employers. Each
tester diary entry described the overall interaction with com-
ments made by the employer or representative. The diary
entries were read four times and the top three prominent
similarities or emergent themes were recorded.
Categories were determined from the diaries' compara-
tive analysis. This was done in part, to review the diary
entries for clarity and correctness. Incidents were developed
from making observations of differential treatment recorded
by the testers for the job site that was visited. This was
recorded for that particular site and the tester. After the com-
pletion of all 30 job sites, it was determined through the com-
parisons if any similarities or patterns existed among the
incidents.
Data produced by constant comparative analysis were
interpreted through descriptive statistics. This systematic
Wells 3
method of constant comparative analysis was used to eval-
uate the content of the diary entries to determine what
themes or theories emerged (Creswell, 1998; Hatch, 2002).
Specifically, a comparison was made of the interactions of
the Black and White testers who applied at the same job
site using the same criteria with the employer or represen-
tative. The only significant difference between the two tes-
ters was race. The two testers did not know each other,
never knowingly met each other, and the job sites were
randomly selected.
Research Rationale--Debriefings
Testers were required to call the researcher after auditing
each job site. This allowed the researcher the opportunity
to debrief the tester after the completion of each job site
audit by telephone. A second debriefing occurred at the
end of the workday for the testers. This was a daily indi-
vidual debriefing of each tester. The debriefing consisted
of reviewing the diary entries of the testers. During the
review, the testers were instructed to describe their experi-
ences at each job site. This was done as the researcher
reviewed each of the diary entries of the testers, requested
clarification if needed, and checked the observations
entered in the diaries for accuracy and completeness. The
information obtained during the debriefings was subjected
to the same comparative analysis rigor as the diary entries
(Creswell, 1998; Hatch, 2002).
Description of Testers and Sites
Testers were employed from the local colleges and universi-
ties in the Milwaukee area. Two testers (one White male and
one Black male) were selected. The testers were selected and
matched based on their age and race. They were counseled
by a professional employment specialist regarding their
dress, physical appearance, and communication skills that
are appropriate for seeking employment. Also, for the pur-
pose of this study, they were assigned similar characteristics
of education and work experience for application purposes.
Testers were required to have their own means of transporta-
tion. Also, they were required to apply only at those places
assigned to them by the researcher. Furthermore, they were
not allowed to accept any employment from any of the
audited employers during this research.
The 30 employers were selected from the city of
Milwaukee, randomly from the Sunday classified section of
the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper and JobNet. The
testers were randomly assigned to apply for entry-level posi-
tions at the assigned employer.
The testers were trained to record their interactions with
the employer and others during the application process. The
testers recorded their interactions with the employer or rep-
resentative immediately after leaving the premises. They
made their diary entries prior to going to subsequent job
sites. They recorded the day, date, time, and location in their
diary. They also recorded conversations with the employer or
representative at each site, as well as a physical description
of each. Furthermore, they recorded the race, gender, the
approximate age, build, hair color, dress, and other charac-
teristics to assist in identifying the individuals. These proce-
dures were part of the training that was conducted by a
former member of law enforcement who had experience in
covert operations.
The present study design allowed both testers the oppor-
tunity to visit the same employer under the same circum-
stances of having a CR or NCR. Therefore, the impact of
personal contact by CR and race were examined as to their
interactions with each employer's representative.
Summary of Findings: Emergent
Themes
The present study found that 73% of the employers studied
inquired of the criminal history through the application. The
majority of the employers (57%) who asked information
regarding a criminal history in the application offered a dis-
claimer. A disclaimer is described as informing the applicant
that a CR does not necessarily bar them from being hired.
The debriefings and diary entries indicated that the per-
sonal contact had a positive impact on the White male tester.
The White male tester reported enjoyable experiences during
the application process at the CR and NCR job sites. The
White male tester debriefings and diary entries indicated the
application process was a positive emotional experience.
The debriefings and the diary entries revealed a dramatic
difference between the two testers. The Black tester indi-
cated that he was frustrated and dissatisfied with the applica-
tion process. The application process had a negative
emotional effect on the Black tester. Also, the comparison
revealed that the negative effect experienced by the Black
tester was across the CR and NCR job sites. Moreover, no
experiences reflecting such negativity were reported by the
White tester.
The gatekeepers in the application process were barriers
for the Black male tester participation in the process. He
was not only denied applications by the gatekeepers, he was
discouraged from participating in the process. For example,
he was asked direct questions regarding his willingness to
participate in a drug screening, he reported being treated
rude, and he was not offered assistance in completing the
application.
The use of constant comparative analysis of the diary
entries resulted in three themes. These themes relate to
(a) the power and authority of the gatekeepers in the employ-
ment application process, (b) racism, and (c) the emotional
effect of the application process. All three of the themes
emerged after careful examination of the diary entries.
4 SAGE Open
Gatekeepers
One theme that emerged from the diaries of the testers is the
role of the employee having initial contact with the appli-
cants. The employee was named the gatekeeper. It was
observed during this research that the gatekeepers' primary
responsibility in the hiring process was to dispense and
retrieve applications. The analysis of the diary entries
revealed how these responsibilities were taken to various
levels of liberty with some gatekeepers on several occasions.
It was observed in the diary entries that the gatekeepers
decided who received applications and who did not. The tes-
ters' diary entries supported that the gatekeepers were deny-
ing applications more often to the Black male tester as
compared with the White male tester. At one location, the
Black male tester was denied an application and the White
male tester was given one immediately within minutes of
the Black tester being denied.
I went to the office and was greeted by a White female, white
shirt, 35- to 40-years old, blond-colored hair, and she was heavy
build. I told her I was there to apply for the "call taker" position.
She told me they were out of applications and turned away. I
didn't believe her so I stood for a split second, surprised, and
then I started to walk away. I saw a White guy heading to the
window so I was looking back to see was she going to give him
an application. I could see her looking at me until I got to the
door. She had to lean to look around the White guy who was now
at her window. I believe she gave him an application but I
couldn't be sure. (Wednesday, Black Male Tester, NCR,
Customer Service Representative)
When I first entered the building I went through the right
entrance, walked to the counter, told the receptionist there,
African American female, petite black hair, mid-to-late 20s that
I was there to apply for the "call taker" position, she informed
me that I'd have to exit, go through the other entrance, and fill
out an application in the other office (with the plate-glass
window).
I exited and reentered the correct office, approached the plate-
glass window, informed the new receptionist, White female,
blond hair heavy-set, white shirt, early 30s that I was there to
apply for the call taker position. She told me that I was free to fill
out an application (located at a small table to the right) and if I
wanted to return it tomorrow, it had to be in before 2:00 p.m.
(Wednesday, White Male Tester, NCR, Customer Service
Representative)
There were other examples of how the gatekeepers used
their authority. The gatekeepers offered support to the White
male applicant in verifying that the information was com-
plete and accurate. The White male tester commented on one
job site, where the gatekeeper reviewed applications for the
appropriate signature and indicated that was one of the first
few things the manager checked. This was the job site where
the same gatekeeper prescreened the Black male tester
regarding his work behavior, and asked if he was amenable
to being fingerprinted, taking a drug test, and allowing a
background check before being given an application.
When I first entered the business I approached the reception
counter and the clerk, White male, brown hair (short), red
company uniform shirt with "Pete" written on front, asked how
he could help. I told him that I was there to apply for the driver's
position and he handed over a lengthy application. He pointed
out that they needed information about job history up to
10 years. He then told me that I could grab a seat in the lounge
at the picnic table to fill out the application.1
When I finished I returned to the counter. Pete reviewed the
application to make sure that all of the signatures were there
(which he mentioned was the first thing that the manager looked
at). He asked to photocopy my license and told me that the
manager would be in later today. He would review my
application and would be giving me a call later this week. I
thanked him, we shook hands, and I exited. (Monday, White
Male Tester, CR, Driver)
I was greeted by four White males. All were in their early to late
40s. I talked to the shortest of the four men, who had short
brown hair and a beard and mustache. They all had on the
company uniforms with first names sewn above the pocket. I
talked to the one with "Pete" sewn onto his shirt. I told him I was
there to apply for the driver's position. He asked me if I would
mind working long hours. I told him no. He asked if I would
mind being fingerprinted, because by federal law they would
have to do it. I told him no. Then he asked me if I needed a few
days to take a drug test. I said no, I'm not worried about that. He
said we also do background checks. I said O.K. After the
questioning, he said I'll go get you an application to fill out. I
completed the application and returned it to the same person. He
accepted the application and I left. (Friday, Black Male Tester,
CR, Driver)
There were other examples in the diaries describing the
roles of the gatekeepers. Another diary entry of the Black
male tester discussed being asked about previous experience
in international shipping and the possibility of having a CR.
Again, these were questions that were asked prior to giving
him an application that were not asked of the White male
tester.
At another job site, the gatekeeper asked the White male
tester if he had an appointment. When he informed her that
he did not, she told him to have a seat and found someone to
interview him, thereby receiving an interview. The gate-
keeper also pointed out to him the areas on the application
that must be completed that included a skill list and math
quiz. In interacting with the same gatekeeper, as described in
the diary, the Black male did not receive the special instruc-
tion or specific directions in terms of which section to
complete.
In a similar experience at a different job site, the White
male tester recorded his experience with a human resource
Wells 5
manager who informed him that she wanted to interview him
after he completed the application. The human resources
manager indicated that she was alerted to him by the recep-
tionist (gatekeeper). There were similar diary entries where
the gatekeeper was offering assistance to the White male tes-
ter in the form of reviewing his application and referring him
to interviews and no such support was given to the Black
male tester.
When I first entered the building I approached the receptionist,
White female, dark brown curly hair glasses, brown shirt, and
early 40s and I told her that I wanted to apply for the driver's
position. She showed me an introduction letter, which states that
the applicants must show two forms of ID, high school diploma,
and three personal character reference letters. I explained that I
only had the ID and social security cards with me but I could get
everything else. The receptionist gave me the application and
invited me to grab a seat and fill it out.
While I was filling out the application, the HR manager came
out (White female, blond hair, tan suit) and said that she was told
by the receptionist that I was completing an application and she
wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions about getting my
diploma and letter of reference. I told her I could get both. She
then invited me to stay after my application was filled out for a
prescreening interview.
When I finished the application I gave it to the receptionist
who looked it over carefully, copied my SS card and driver's
license, and then told me to have a seat and wait for the HR
manager. After a few moments she directed me to the HR
manager who invited me into her office. She began asking
questions about my employment history, driving history, etc.
She explained what the job entailed and described the 2-week
training. She described the criminal background check as
important and said that "if there's anything on your record
you should write it down because it won't matter unless it
relates seriously to the job. But, if something came up that
wasn't written down then it will be considered falsification of
application and I would get fired." She then stated that she
didn't foresee that being a problem in my case. We discussed
some other general points of the job. She handed me her
business card in case I had questions later. She thanked me
for coming in. We shook hands, and I thanked her for the
interview. I also made sure to thank the receptionist on my
way out, and then exited the building. (Monday, White Male
Tester, NCR, Driver)
Upon entering I was greeted by a receptionist, White female in
her late 30s, brown shoulder length hair with glasses. I told her I
was there to apply for the driver position and she handed me a
very long application with several inserts. She asked did I have
a driver's license, social security card, diploma, and three letters
of reference letters. She said you will need that before an
interview. I told her it would not be a problem to have this
information for her. Upon completion of the application the
receptionist looked it over and said I will give this to the
manager. (Tuesday, Black Male Tester, NCR, Driver)
Diary Entries: Racism
Another theme throughout the diary entries involved captur-
ing the "real-life" experiences of the testers. In the research
by Pager (2003), Pager and Quillian (2005), and Yinger
(1986) discussed how audit studies provide "real-life" data.
Such data, rich in detail and story cannot be captured using
surveys (Yinger, 1986). For instance, the diary entry from the
Black male tester, who was prescreened in the presence of
the gatekeeper coworker, revealed on-the-spot details and
reactions that could never be captured in such rich narrative
after the experience. The same situation also illustrated how
the gatekeeper verified the accuracy of information for the
White tester, but not for the Black tester. If the two testers
had not been sent to the same location under the same condi-
tions, these facts may never have been disclosed. This sup-
ported the theme that the disparity in treatment is based on
the race of the tester.
There are several examples that supported this theme of
disparities in the application process on the part of the gate-
keepers that are based on race. They included asking ques-
tions that are not in the application, not reviewing all
applications for accuracy, and being denied an application
when the process was still open. The diary entries were cru-
cial in capturing how the gatekeepers exercised their appar-
ent authority over the initial interview process. There is
evidence that the gatekeepers discriminately selected who
could access the attention of their superiors and who could
not. In this case, the White male tester gained access, while
the Black male tester did not.
One example involved the description of an event where
the Black male tester sensed the gatekeeper did not tell the
truth regarding her assertion that they were not accepting any
applications. He described his attempt to see if she was going
to give an application to a White male who was walking up
to the gatekeeper as he was leaving, who proved to be the
other unknown tester. He could see her watching his every
move until he left the building. He reported not being able to
see her hand the White male an application, but it was veri-
fied in the diary and debriefing of the White male tester that
he did receive an application.
When I first entered, I approached the host, White male, Black
short hair, black shirt, late 20s and told him that I was there to
apply for the busser position. He got an application from under
the counter and handed it to me. I took a seat in one of the booths
to fill it out.
When I finished the application, I looked around for the host to
turn it in, but he was nowhere to be found. I was going to just
leave it on the table or wait a moment until he returned but then
a manager approached. I asked if I could turn in the application
with him. He informed me that he was looking for me because
"Paul" said I was applying for the busser position. He invited me
to take a seat at one of the tables for an impromptu interview.
He asked what type of hours I was looking for, if I was still
6 SAGE Open
attending school and how much, and whether I was presently
employed. My criminal history (CR job site) never came up in
the interview. When he ran out of questions, he introduced
himself as "Tom" (White male, balding brown hair, black shirt,
and late 40s). He told me that he would pass the application on
to "Karen" but he told me she was out of town for the week
because her brother was getting married. He said that she'd
probably get in touch with me next week for a second interview.
I thanked him, we shook hands, and I exited the restaurant.
(Wednesday, White Male Tester, CR, Busser)2
I was greeted by a young White male in his 20s with dark hair. I
told him I was applying for the bus boy position that was
advertised. He went to the dining area and returned with an
application. He told me if he wasn't around when I was done, I
should leave the application on the bar. I completed the
application and I was about to leave it on the bar when I saw the
White male. I took him the application. I asked him will there be
interviews? The White male looks down at the application and
said he just give them out and pass them on. He mumbled
something under his breath and walked away. (Friday, Black
Male Tester, CR, Busser)
The White male tester also described an interview where
the Human Resource Manager asked him where he went to
grade school. He reported although she had been told about
his CR "she did not flinch." Similarly, he shared an incident
where an owner hired him on the spot before he took a drug
test. This experience mirrored another position where he was
told he could start training before he took a drug test or com-
pleted his background check.
When I arrived I had to be buzzed into the warehouse after
ringing the door bell and announcing myself. The owner of the
company, White male, White hair with a bit of gray, black shirt,
mid-to-late 50s, extremely nice guy, led me to the table with
applications sitting in a box on top. Before grabbing me the
application he asked me a few questions, such as, "Have you
ever driven before?" (yes). Where have you been working?"
"Different jobs." "Why stop?" (Better opportunities somewhere
else), etc. He told me that the regular guy in charge of hiring was
on vacation, so I should just fill out the application and then talk
to him [the owner].
Before I could even finish the first page of the application the
owner sat down in front of me at the table and told me that since
he would be leaving soon that he'd take a look at what I had so
far. I offered him my resume as well since I hadn't even gotten
close to the employment history section. He looked it over,
asked me about my experiences in college. He told me a story
about his times there in the 60s and how he was entering the
Union (still under construction when he heard that Kennedy had
been shot; 1963). He asked some pointed questions and basically
told me that it was a foolish move ("take it from the owner of a
company; this ain't the way to do it"), and told me about his
partner whose kids are bankers and engineers because their dad
didn't want them in this business. He asked if lifting would be a
problem, whether I could pass a drug test, etc. He then told me
that he'd give me a job, but under one condition" that after a
year of delivery I would return to school (or else he'd fire me so
that I could return to school). I agreed and we shook hands.
The owner then told me to finish up the application and he'd get
the paperwork started. When I'd finished the application, the
foreman, White male short light brown hair heavy-set, green
shirt, mid-to-late 40s, came over to the table with paperwork for
the drug test. He collected my application, got on the phone with
the drug testing center. He then filled out some paperwork, I
signed where I needed to, and he gave me directions to the
testing center. The owner came back over and told me to report
to work tomorrow at 5:30 a.m. and that I'd be going out to
Madison with him. We talked for moment longer (mostly about
the job and common sense), he told me that he wasn't just hiring
me to be a fill-in, that he was getting ready to fire one driver and
that another had been on workman's comp for 3 months, and
that I'd have a fairly permanent position. I thanked him again for
the opportunity, we shook hands again, and I left the building.
(Thursday, White Male Tester, NCR, Delivery Driver)
I was buzzed in and greeted by a White female in her 30s with
brown hair. I told her I was there to put in an application for the
driver position. She asked me did I have a CDL. I told her that
the ad said no CDL was needed. She directed me to a table
where the applications were in a box. I completed the application
and returned it to her. She informed me that the hiring manager
was on vacation and he would be reviewing application when he
returned. (Thursday, Black Male Tester, NCR, Delivery Driver)
There were numerous examples of events captured during
the audit that promoted using the diary method of data col-
lection and analysis. The "real-life experiences" of the tes-
ters provided rich understandings of events that are not
recorded by the employer or his or her agent.
Emotional Effects
It was clear from the diary entries of both testers that the
application process had an emotional impact that is distinc-
tively different. The debriefing sessions that followed each
experience disclosed these feelings over time. The White
male tester related more positive personal contacts during
the application process. He used phrases that expressed his
pleasure in his duties like "I got to work." He frequently
ended his diary entries with how he thanked the person
before exiting the building. In one of his diary entries he
wrote, "I also made sure to thank the receptionist on my way
out . . . " The White male testers related the experience with
the owner of a company who hired him on the spot. He
referred to him as a "fatherly advisor."
The personal reactions by the testers were critical to
understanding the feeling beneath the written word. In one
entry the Black male tester accused the gatekeeper at one
location of being untruthful. He described the experience of
another gatekeeper checking his background and looking up
at him every 2 min. One gatekeeper was described as being
rude, arrogant, and flippant, because he told him that his job
Wells 7
was merely to accept the applications and pass them on, and
then he walked away.
Words describing the personal contacts were extremely
insightful. In our debriefing, the Black male became encour-
aged when an employee representative indicated that he was
the most qualified applicant he had seen in 2 years. His con-
fidence seemed to improve after being approached at another
location where he described a positive interaction with an
African American gatekeeper who described specifics about
the process, and the experience, "we hit it off."
The application process also had a dramatic negative
emotional effect on the Black male tester. He described situ-
ations in his debriefs but with more compelling terms. For
example, during the debriefing of the job site where he was
prescreened by "Pete," he explained that the questioning was
accusatory. Also, he explained that the experience was more
than the questions and that it is something you had to experi-
ence. His emotional reactions became more apparent as the
process continued. He questioned how people could do this
every day. He became disturbed regarding the incident where
he believed a gatekeeper did not tell the truth about being out
of applications and turned him away. During the debriefing,
he became insistent that the receptionist (gatekeeper) delib-
erately lied.
The Black male tester voiced frustration when he felt
rejection from someone of his race. He revealed how an
African American woman in charge of hiring reacted when
she reviewed that he had marked on his application that he
had a CR. He provided the scripted explanation of his drug
arrest. He became distraught as he described how she rose
from her chair as a signal that it was time for him to leave.
I was greeted by a young Black male in his mid 20s, with short
black hair. I told him I wanted to apply for a driver position. He
told me to wait and he would get the manager. He returned with
a medium to heavy built African American woman with black
hair. I told her I wanted to apply for the driver position. She gave
me an application from a drawer and told me to bring it to her
office when I was done. I completed the application and went to
her office. She invited me in and told me to have a seat. She
looked at the application and the first thing she asked about was
the arrest. I told her about the arrest and how the Judge sent me
to the House of Corrections. Her attitude changed and she said
someone would call me for an interview. As she said this, she
stood up indicating I should leave. (Monday, Black Male Tester,
CR, Driver)
The above experience of the Black male was not the same
for the White male tester. The White male tester visited the
same location the following Wednesday:
When I first entered the building I approached the reception
window and requested an application from the receptionist,
African American male, short black hair (shaved almost bald
and late 20s, heavy-set). He asked to see my driver's license and
gave me the application once I handed the license over. I took
the application to the table and began working. He came out of
the office about halfway through the application and returned
my DL.
When I finished the application, I was told to take it and the
photocopy of my DL back to the processing office. I met with
the Human Resource/Hiring person (African American female,
heavy-set, black hair, late 30s, white shirt) who gave me an
on-the-spot interview. She inquired about my driving experience,
whether I'd accept a job at the Waukesha office if the Milwaukee
jobs were all full, what my availability was. She even gave me a
little quiz about Milwaukee street locations and the location of
certain places (Zoo, Museum, etc.), which I passed with flying
colors.
There was never any mention of a criminal record in the
interview but it was in the application. She finished by giving
me a set of handouts to study in preparation for a CDL class
meant to train me for getting a permit. She then told me that she
would give me a call by Friday to let me know if I cleared the
background, but she told me that I could start the class tomorrow
at 9:00 a.m. It was my choice whether to wait for clearance. I
thanked her, we chatted for another moment and then I exited
the building. (Wednesday, White Male Tester, CR, Driver)
Based on these "real-life" experiences, the two testers
demonstrated very different emotional responses to the
application process. The White male tester appeared more
upbeat and required less reassurance; he enjoyed the experi-
ence. The Black male tester needed notably more encourage-
ment particularly as the process continued and frustration
and discouragement escalated.
Summary
The diary entries richly reflect the significance of the per-
sonal contact by the employer or representative as more
favorable to the White over the Black tester. Note that each
one of the locations resulting in a diary entry is frequented by
both testers. The diary entries supported the evidence that
race and criminal history impacted the employment decision
to call back an applicant in the present study.
Interestingly, the diary entries of the testers revealed how
some employers and their representatives responded to the
applicants. The diary method facilitated insight into the com-
pelling nature of these writings. Each tester wrote of his
unique experiences when interacting with employers and
each representative as accurately as they could capture.
These findings were supported by the specific entries into
the diaries of the testers. This data reflected that the employ-
ers and their representatives favored the White male tester
who received more interviews from personal contact. For
instance, it became apparent that the gatekeepers were favor-
ing the White tester. The Black tester was denied applica-
tions, whereas data supported that the White tester received
an application from the same person. There was also evi-
8 SAGE Open
dence in behavior notations to support that this was inten-
tional on the part of the employee.
The intentional disparity in treatment between the White
tester and the Black tester support the theme of racism.
Throughout the debriefings and diary entries, there are
examples of the gatekeepers favoring the White tester over
the Black tester. The Black male tester was denied applica-
tions, treated indifferently, and not provided assistance that
was extended to the White tester. It was also evidence from
the debriefings and diary entries that this had a negative
emotional effect on the Black tester. The White male tester
expressed a positive outlook on the application process.
There were events during the audit that could not be cap-
tured using merely survey methods. For example, in some
cases the Black male tester was denied applications, was
subjected to preapplication screening, and was told posi-
tions were filled. Yet, at one job site the Black male tester
was praised by an African American manager as being one
of the most qualified applicants he had seen in 2 years but
still did not get a callback. In another case, an African
American employer offered to make sure the application of
the Black male tester got to the manager. He also told him
how to follow-up on the process. The Black male tester
received a callback from the employer.
Similar experiences occurred with the White male tester.
The White male tester reported that at a CR job site, the man-
ager asked him about a school she thought his brother may
have attended with her. He wrote in his diary that during the
interview he told her of his scripted response about his CR.
He wrote, "She didn't even flinch."
The White male tester also wrote about being hired by one
employer before he completed the application by promising
to have a drug screening. He described the employer as a
"fatherly advisor." He also described an experience with a
human resource manager who interviewed him writing that
she encouraged him to disclose all of his criminal history on
the application. Another experience of the White male tester
occurred at a CR job site. There is no question on the applica-
tion regarding a criminal history, so he told the manager of
his scripted story during the interview. The White male tester
wrote there was no follow-up regarding his criminal history.
Conclusion
The constant comparative analysis of the diary entries
revealed three dominant themes. These themes include
(a) the power and authority of the gatekeepers, (b) racism,
and (c) the emotional effects of the application process.
Several visits indicated that the gatekeepers were denying
applications to the Black male tester. In contrast, they were
offering assistance to the White tester that resulted in him
obtaining interviews and assistance with the completion of
the application. Furthermore, the Black male tester was
asked prescreening questions by the gatekeepers that were
not asked of the White male tester. At one job site, the Black
male tester reported feeling intimidated by the questions
asked by the gatekeeper, because they were asked in the pres-
ence of employees.
The emerging theme of capturing acts of disparate treat-
ment or racism observed during the "real-life" experiences of
the testers demonstrated the richness of information obtained
through audit and diary entries. The behavior of the gate-
keeper was captured in the diaries as events resulting from
the interaction with the testers. The "real-life" experience
involved the gatekeepers exercising authority in the process
that cannot be verified as legitimate.
The action of the gatekeepers had an emotional effect on
the testers. The White male tester was treated positively by
the gatekeepers so his behavior was positive and upbeat. The
Black male tester became frustrated at the repeat rejection
and behavior from the gatekeepers. He required more coun-
seling and coaching as the process progressed.
Several instances were reported where the gatekeepers
influenced who obtained an application and an interview. It
appears that individuals in these entry-level positions have
acquired a significant amount of power and authority. They
have either elevated themselves or have been elevated by
others in the organization. Moreover, it was not even appar-
ent if their superiors were aware of the liberties taken. The
details captured in the diaries and debriefing sessions
revealed that the gatekeepers appeared to make decisions
based on their perceptions of the individuals who walked
through their doors
The behaviors of the gatekeepers are examples of how the
Black male tester was discouraged and prevented from par-
ticipating in the process. These are also examples of activi-
ties and behaviors that cannot be captured by a survey.
Moreover, it is difficult to design and implement an effective
survey to capture the same information observed in the pres-
ent study. It is unlikely that a gatekeeper will admit in a sur-
vey that they denied applications to Black applicants. It is
also unlikely that a gatekeeper shall admit to aiding some
applicants based on their race to obtain an interview. There
were many similar incidents in the diaries that do not lend
themselves to a survey but are better suited for real-world
controlled experiments.
It is important to recognize that the behavior of the gate-
keeper can persist because there appeared to be no visible
mechanism or process in place to monitor their activity. In
short, they do because they can. One could argue that the
employers allow this behavior to occur at the hands of an
entry-level low-paying and likely expendable person,
because they comply with the will of the employer. This also
allows the employer an opportunity to avoid taken positive
action toward increasing diversity of the workplace.
