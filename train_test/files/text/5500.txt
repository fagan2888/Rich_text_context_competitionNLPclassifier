Abstract
Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorder affecting millions of people in the United States. Although a
positive family history is one of the most important risk factors for ET, the genetic causes of ET remain unknown. In this
study, whole exome sequencing and subsequent approaches were performed in a family with an autosomal dominant form of
early-onset ET. Functional analyses including mutagenesis, cell culture, gene expression, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, and
apoptosis assays were also performed. A disease-segregating mutation (p.Gly171Ala), absent in normal population, was
identified in the SORT1 gene. The p.Gly171Ala mutation was shown not only to impair the expression of its encoding protein
sortilin but also the mRNA levels of its binding partner p75 neurotrophin receptor that is known to be implicated in brain
injury, neuronal apoptosis, and neurotransmission.

Introduction
Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common
neurological disorders among adults whose incidence
increases with age. Albeit its core motor symptom is
an 8- to 12-Hz kinetic tremor of the arms, some
patients with ET also develop other motor and non-
motor manifestations, including parkinsonism, myoclo-
nus, dystonia, cerebellar dysfunction, sensory
abnormalities, sleep disorders, and cognitive and psy-
chiatric features (Louis, 2010). Despite many magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) studies have supported the
hypothesis that the abnormalities of the cerebellotha-
lamo-cortical motor pathway and the fronto-parietal
circuit are involved in the functional pathological
changes of ET (Bagepally et al., 2012), there is still
a controversy as to whether there is an underlying
neurodegenerative process of the cerebellum in ET
(Buijink et al., 2013; Symanski et al., 2014).
Consequently, there is growing evidence that ET may

not be a single disease but rather a family of diseases
(Benito-Leon, 2014).
Although familial aggregation has been long reported
in ET, with 50% to 70% of patients having a familial
form of ET, and a positive family history being one of
the most important risk factor for ET (Louis et al., 2001),
the genetic basis of ET remain elusive. This is partly due
to misdiagnosis is a common feature in ET, with 37% to
50% of ET patients reported to be misdiagnosed (Schrag
et al., 2000). Genetic variants within LINGO1 (MIM
#609791), DRD3 (MIM #126451), and HS1-BP3 (MIM
#609359) genes have been reported to have susceptibility
for developing ET; however, these associations have not
been consistently replicated (Zimprich, 2011;
Kuhlenbaumer et al., 2014). Through genome-wide asso-
ciation and whole exome sequencing (WES) analyses,
SLC1A2 (MIM #600300) and FUS (MIM #137070)
genes have been reported to respectively carry suscepti-
bility or causative alleles for ET (Merner et al., 2012;
Thier et al., 2012). While the disease-associated mutation
identified in the FUS gene was only present in 54% of
individuals classified as ``possible'' ET, it fully segregated
with disease in individuals with definite and probable ET
(Merner et al., 2012). More recently, a disease-
segregating mutation (p.G399S) in the HTRA2 gene has
been reported in a large kindred featuring both ET and
Parkinson's disease (Unal Gulsuner et al., 2014). Taken
together, these clinical barriers associated with ET make
traditional gene discovery approaches not succeed in the
identification of the causal gene defect. Therefore, in an
attempt to identify a causative gene for ET, we performed
WES and subsequent functional analyses in a family fea-
turing an autosomal dominant form of early-onset ET.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
A Spanish ET family consisting of an affected father, an
unaffected paternal aunt, a healthy mother as well as one
affected and two unaffected siblings was clinically exam-
ined and subject to WES approaches (Figure 1(a)).
Subjects were recruited from a descriptive study of famil-
iar and sporadic ET cases and controls carried out in the
Movement Disorders Unit at the Donostia University
Hospital (San Sebastian, Spain). Genomic DNA samples
from all family members in addition to samples from
another 28 familial and 62 sporadic ET cases (n ¼ 90)
were available for study. A cohort composed of 188 con-
trol chromosomes of Spanish individuals without family
history of any movement disorders was also available.
The age at sample collection of the control cohort
ranged from 60 to 93 years with an average of 69.1
years. The local ethics committee at the Donostia
University Hospital approved this study and informed
consent was obtained from all participants. DNA sam-
ples from all participating members were isolated from
whole blood using standard procedures. All methods
were carried out in accordance with the approved
guidelines.
Clinical Examination
All participants in this study underwent a series of struc-
tured questionnaires and a comprehensive neurological
and neuropsychological assessment undertaken at the
Movement Disorders Unit by three experienced move-
ment disorder specialist (JFM-M, JRM, and AB). The
following standardized protocol was used: (a) demo-
graphic variables; (b) personal and family history and gen-
eral medical health (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score
[range: 0­42], total number of prescription medications);
(c) neurological assessment: a subjective motor complains
questionnaire, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence
scale, a motor examination including UPDRS part III and
a general examination in order to detect dystonia, myo-
clonus, ataxia, and polyneuropathy as well as a specific
tremor exploration that includes one test for postural
tremor and five for kinetic tremor; (d) the use of medica-
tion (yes vs. no); (e) additional variables of interest (e.g.,
age of symptom onset); (f) the SCOPA-AUT assessment
of autonomic dysfunction (Visser et al., 2004); and (g) the
Pittsburgh sleep quality index (Buysse et al., 1989). The
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) that assesses
different cognitive domains (http://www.mocatest.org/)
was used to determine possible cognitive dysfunction
and DSM-IV criteria were used for diagnosis of depres-
sion and anxiety disorders (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994). In addition to the standard clinical
exploration described above, evaluation of ET was carried
out by recording the drawing of an ``Archimedes spiral''
(Elble et al., 1990) and using the Fahn­Tolosa­Marin
tremor rating scale (TRS; Fahn et al 2003). Surface elec-
tromyography (EMG) was recorded from wrist extensor
and flexor muscles using surface electrodes placed over the
muscle bellies 3 cm apart. The filters were set with a band-
pass of 10 Hz to 1 kHz. A triaxial accelerometer was
placed over the first dorsal interossei muscle of the
hand. In an effort to minimize diagnostic pitfalls, clinical
criteria were comprehensively reviewed by the Consensus
Statement of the Movement Disorder Society on Tremor
(Deuschl et al., 1998) and the Washington Heights­
Inwood Genetic Study of Essential Tremor criteria
(Louis et al., 1997; Benito-Leon and Louis, 2006). Each
patient received a diagnosis of ET from a movement dis-
orders neurologist after the first evaluation which subse-
quently was confirmed by consensus with the rest of the
team based on the review of the clinical data and electro-
physiological records from the second evaluation using
the formerly described diagnostic criteria. Criteria for
2 ASN Neuro
definitive ET included abnormal bilateral postural or kin-
etic tremor of the hands in the absence of other neuro-
logical symptoms.
WES Approaches
Four DNA samples from two affected (Cases 1 and 3)
and two unaffected cases (Cases 2 and 4) were subject to
WES analyses (Figure 1(a)). The SureSelect Human All
exon 50 Mb exon-capture kit was used for library enrich-
ment (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and
captured libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq2000
according to the manufacturer's instructions for paired-
end 100-bp reads (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA), using a
single flow cell lane per sample. Sequencing data were put
through a computational pipeline for WES data process-
ing and analysis following the general workflow adopted
by the 1000 genomes project (DePristo et al., 2011) and as
described elsewhere (Marti-Masso et al., 2013). Each
exome's statistics were conducted in PICARD (http://
picard.sourceforge.net/).
Filtering of Common Genetic Variation
Any potential mutation observed as common variation
(frequency > 5%) in the latest dbSNP137 build, 1000
Genomes Project Phase 1, other public databases, such
as the Exome Variant Server of the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project
(http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; Exome Variant
Server, 2015), or exomes generated in house (Marti-
Masso et al., 2013) was removed from further analyses.
Only genetic variants mapping to coding and splice site
regions were considered causative.

Prediction of Mutation Pathogenicity
The pathogenicity of each novel disease-segregating
mutation was predicted by four computational methods:
MutPred (http://mutpred.mutdb.org/), SNPs&Go
(http://snps-and-go.biocomp.unibo.it/snps-and-go/),
Mutation taster (http://www.mutationtaster.org/), and
SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/). The NCBI HomoloGene
database was used to examine the conservation of novel
SNVs identified in different species (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/homologene). The professional Human Gene
Mutation Database (https://portal.biobase-international.
com/hgmd/pro/start.php) and the NCBI ClinVar database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) were used to deter-
mine if novel single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were
already known to be associated with disease-related
phenotypes.
Gene Screening Analyses
Genomic primers for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
amplifications of the entire coding region and intron­
exon boundaries of SORT1, LAPTM5 exon 5, and
GRIN2D exon 13 were designed using a primer design
public website (http://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/ExonPrimer.html;
primer sequences available upon request). All purified
PCR products were sequenced in both forward and
reverse directions by Sanger sequencing using Applied
Biosystems BigDye terminator v3.1 sequencing chemistry
as per the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed as
described elsewhere (Marti-Masso et al., 2013).
Mutagenesis and Cell-Culture Assays
Human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 were cultured in
Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
The SORT1 p.Gly171Ala (p.G171A) mutation was intro-
duced into the human pCMV6-XL5-SORT1 wild-type
plasmid (Origene, Rockville, MD) by site-directed muta-
genesis (QuikChangeII, Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA). All generated constructs were verified in
both directions by Sanger sequencing and using the
human sequence GRCh37.p13 as a reference.
HEK293 cells were grown in 96-well and 12-well tissue
culture plates. After reaching confluency ($80%), cells
were transiently transfected using FuGene 6
Transfection Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) with
0.1 mg of either pCMV6-XL5-SORT1 wild-type or
mutant human plasmids. After 24 hr, culture media was
replaced and cells were treated independently with 10 ng/
ml or 30 ng/ml of two different pro-neurotrophics factors:
pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) and pro-brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF), or with a com-
bination of both of them (Novoprotein, Summit, NJ).
Cells were then incubated at 37C for 72 hr except for
apoptosis assays in which a 16 h incubation was used.
Conditioned media was collected and cells were harvested.
Gene Expression Analyses
RNA extraction from HEK293 cells was performed using
the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as
per manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA was tran-
scribed into cDNA with SuperScript II reverse transcript-
ase (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Gene
expression was carried out by qPCR using an Eco Real-
Time PCR System (Illumina, San Diego, CA),
SYBRGreen PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA), and the following oligonucleotide
sequences: SORT1-F 50-GGGGACACATGGAGCA
TGG-30 and SORT1-R 50-GGAATAGACAATGCCTC
GATCAT-30 for SORT1 expression, B2MF1-F 50-GGC
CGAGATGTCTCGCTCCG-30 and B2MR1 50-TTGGA
GTACGCTGGATAGCCTCC-30 for B2M, and p75-F 50-
CCTACGGCTACTACCAGGATG-30 and p75-R 50-
CACACGGTGTTCTGCTTGT-30 for p75NTR. Samples
were run in triplicates, analyzed using the standard curve
method, and normalized to B2M housekeeping gene using
the 2ÀÁÁCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).
Immunoblot Analyses
Lysates from cells were prepared in radioactive immuno-
precipitation assay buffer and treated with protease inhibi-
tor cocktail. Equal amounts of proteins were added to
Laemmli's buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), heated for
5 min at 95C, and loaded into a 15-wells 4% to 12%
Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were
then transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in
Phosphate Buffered Saline with Tween-20 (PBST), and
incubated with primary antibody anti-SORT1 (1 mg/ml;
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA; ab16640) and secondary anti-
body anti-Rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
(1:5,000; Abcam; ab6721). Anti-GAPDH antibody
(1:5000, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) was used as loading
control. Protein expression was detected by using
Lumminata Forte (Millipore, Billerica, MA), gel images
were obtained using a G:BOX Chemi image analyzer
(Syngene, Frederick, MD), and densitometric analyses
were performed through the ImageJ software
(imagej.nih.gov).
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
Human progranulin (hPGRN) in conditioned medium
from wild-type and mutant HEK-293 cells was detected
using the DuoSet ELISA Development System kit (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the
4 ASN Neuro
manufacturer's protocol. The hPGRN from five human
samples (Cases 2­6; Figure 1(a)) was measured using the
hPGRN ELISA kit from Adipogen (San Diego, CA).
Absorbance values were measured using a M5 multi-
modal plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA)
at wavelengths of 450 nm and 560 nm.
Apoptosis Assay by Flow Cytometry Analysis
Quantitative analysis of apoptotic cell death was done
using the Alexa FluorÕ 488 Annexin V/Dead Cell
Apoptosis Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). HEK293 cells were treated
with 30 ng/ml of proneurotrophins (proNTs) for 16 hr;
cells were then harvested, stained with Alexa FluorÕ
488-Annexin V and PI in annexin-binding buffer, and
analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD LSR II flow cyt-
ometer and the BD FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience,
San Jose, CA). Cells stained with only Annexin V were
considered as being in early apoptosis, while cells stained
with both Annexin V and PI were considered to be in late
apoptosis or necrotic stage. HEK293 cells treated with
2 mM of hydrogen peroxide were used as positive control
for apoptosis. Data analysis was performed using the
FlowJo software version 9.3.2 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad
Prism software version 6.00 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).
Data on graphs are presented as mean Æ SEM. Statistical
differences between wild-type and mutant were calculated
by using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric U test. For
SORT1 mRNA expression using different proNT con-
centrations, statistical significance was determined using
a linear regression model. Values of p .0001 were con-
sidered highly significant (****).
Results
Phenotypic Examination of a Spanish Family With ET
The reported ET family, who consisted of two ``defini-
tive'' affected individuals as well as four unaffected mem-
bers (Figure 1(a)), featured postural tremor of both hands
with slow progression since childhood. Psychiatric fea-
tures, such as depression and anxiety, were found in
one unaffected member. Detailed clinical descriptions of
all family members examined are described below.
Case 1. This is an affected male who was first seen in 2006
with postural and action tremor of both hands and without
voice, head, or rest tremors. He reported to have tremor with
slow progression since childhood. No other signs of motor
impairment suggestive of parkinsonism, myoclonus,
dystonia, ataxia, and polyneuropathy were identified, and
he did not show any sign of autonomic involvement, sleep
disorder (insomnia, drowsiness, REM sleep behavior disor-
der (RBD)), anxiety, or depression. He did not take any
medication for tremor, but his tremor improved with alcohol
intake. He reported hypercholesterolemia and had a myocar-
dial infarction in 2000 and an atherothrombotic left pontine
infarction in 2001. In 2008, he died of head injury with a left
subdural hematoma and intracranial fronto-temporal hemor-
rhage at 73 years of age. He scored 36 in the TRS scale and
had a MoCA value of 27/30 (normal value > 25). His draw-
ing of right hand spiral is shown in Figure 2(a).
Case 2. This is the wife of case 1 who did not show any sign
of tremor or other neurological symptoms.
Case 3. This is a 48-year-old woman who suffers from tremor
of both hands since childhood. During examination, she
showed symmetric postural tremor involving hands without
resting or action tremors and without affecting head, voice,
and trunk. Her gait was normal and no clinical signs of par-
kinsonism, myoclonus, dystonia, ataxia, and polyneuropathy
were found. She did not present any sign of autonomic
involvement, sleep disorder (insomnia, drowsiness, RBD),
anxiety, or depression. She scored 11 in the TRS scale and
showed normal cognitive status with a MoCA value of 30/30
and a normal brain MRI. EMG recorded a postural tremor of
9.5 Hz of frequency and 46 mV of amplitude. Her total chol-
esterol was 244 mg/dl and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol levels were slightly elevated (176 mg/dl). Her
drawing of right hand spiral is shown in Figure 2(b).
Case 4. This is a 46-year-old woman who reported having
mild tremor of both hands during her childhood when she
was a regular tobacco smoker, but it greatly improved after
smoking withdrawal. On a recent examination, she showed no
tremor and a normal cognitive status (MoCA ¼ 30/30). Her
brain MRI, total cholesterol, and LDL levels were normal.
Case 5. This is a 43-year-old man who apparently has not
reported tremor or an EMG-recorded tremor. His brain MRI
was normal and showed a MoCA value of 30/30. He has
high levels of total cholesterol and LDL and is under treat-
ment with atorvastatine 20 mg/day.
Case 6. This is 67-year-old woman who has had anxiety and
depression symptoms for 15 years and is being treated with
20 mg/day of paroxetine. On examination, she showed no
tremor and her cognitive assessments (MoCA ¼ 30/30) and
LDL levels were normal.
None of the unaffected cases (Cases 4, 5, 6) showed
any sign of motor involvement suggestive of parkinson-
ism, myoclonus, dystonia, ataxia, and polyneuropathy,
nor nonmotor symptoms such as autonomic involvement,
sleep disorders, anxiety, or depression.

WES and Subsequent Analyses
WES approaches performed in four family members cap-
tured between 91.33% (Case 1) and 88.30% (Case 2) of
the target exome at 20-fold coverage or higher.
Approximately 1,000 novel, coding SNVs, including
only missense and nonsense genetic variants, were iden-
tified in each family member sequenced: 1062 SNVs were
identified for Case 3, 1,024 for Case 1, 1,006 for Case 2,
and 884 for Case 4. After adequate filtering and by keep-
ing SNVs only shared by both affected individuals, we
were left with six SNVs as potential disease-associated
mutations. Two of these were not validated through
Sanger sequencing and the other four were also present
in the youngest family member (Case 5), who is appar-
ently unaffected at his 43 years of age. Because the
existence of a variable age at onset is common in families
with tremor, every unaffected individual younger than 50
years should still be considered at risk (Merner et al.,
2012). All four novel SNVs were then tested in 188 eth-
nicity-matched normal chromosomes, but only one was
found present in the control population. A DNA sample
from an additional unaffected member (Case 6) was then
acquired and tested for these three novel SNVs; she was
found to be a noncarrier for any of them. By using four
different computational programs, only two SNVs were
predicted to be deleterious by all programs. Although
one of this (p.Gly171Ala) was reported with very low
frequency (5.769E-05) in the Exome Aggregation
Consortium (ExAC) that contains exome data for a var-
iety of rare diseases including rare neuromuscular dis-
eases (ExAC, 2015), none of them were reported in the

European population. These two SNVs were also highly
conserved across different species while the other one
reported in European population (ExAC data) and situ-
ated in the GRIN2D gene, which encodes a class of iono-
tropic glutamate receptor and has been associated with
schizophrenia susceptibility in the Japanese population
(Makino et al., 2005), was not. The two pathogenic-pre-
dicted, highly conserved SNVs were located within
LAPTM5 and SORT1 genes (Table 1; Figure 1(b) and
(c)). The LAPTM5 gene encodes for a lysosomal-asso-
ciated multispanning membrane protein that is known to
be associated with spontaneous regression of neuroblast-
omas, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and lung cancer
(Finis et al., 2006; Cortese et al., 2008; Inoue et al.,
2009). The SORT1 gene encodes for sortilin, a member
of a family of cellular vacuolar protein sorting 10
domain receptors that is expressed in neurons of the cen-
tral nervous system, including cortical, hippocampal,
and cerebellar neurons, and peripheral nervous system.
SORT1 is known to regulate both neuronal viability and
function through its regulation of both protein transport
and signal transduction (Willnow et al., 2008) and is
known to bind proNTs to control neuronal survival
and cessation (Nykjaer and Willnow, 2012). Sortilin,
which has multifunctional roles in intracellular traffick-
ing of polipeptide from the golgy apparatus to secretory
and endocytic pathways (Nielsen et al., 2001; Chen et al.,
2005), has already been implicated in Alzheimer's disease
(AD) and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration. In AD,
sortilin has been shown to represent a major endocytic
pathway for the clearance of apoE/Ab complexes (Carlo
et al., 2013) and to control APP processing to Ab
(Gustafsen et al., 2013), while in fronto-temporal lobar
degeneration it has been shown to regulate extracellular
levels of progranulin (PGRN; Hu et al., 2010). Sortilin
has also been postulated as a risk factor for hyperchol-
esterolemia and myocardial infarction (Musunuru et al.,
2010). Interestingly, all of our SORT1 mutation carriers
were shown later to carry elevated levels of LDL chol-
esterol, suggesting a possible role of cholesterol homeo-
stasis in the pathogenesis of tremor.
The entire coding region of SORT1 was then examined
in 61 Spanish ET cases (13 familial and 48 sporadic), but
no pathogenic mutation was identified. Likewise, the
exon 4 containing the SORT1 mutation (p.Gly171Ala)
was tested in additional 90 ET cases (28 familial ET
and 62 sporadic), but no additional mutation carrier
was identified.
Functional Assays
The SORT1 p.G171A mutation downregulates its mRNA and
protein expression levels. To further test the pathogenecity
of the SORT1 p.G171A mutation, HEK293 cells were trans-
fected with either wild-type or mutant (p.G171A) plasmids
and quantitative PCR (qPCR) on cDNA extracted from wild-
type and mutant cells was carried out. Sortilin mRNA levels
cells were found nearly three-fold lower in p.G171A muta-
tion carriers than in noncarriers (p < .0001; Figure 3(a)), and
a similar decrease of two-fold between wild-type and mutant
cells was observed at the protein level (p < .05; Figure 3(b)).
Because sortilin binds to the prodomains of both proNGF
and proBDNF to regulate sorting of mature NGF and BDNF
to appropriate endocytic and secretory pathways (Chen et al.,
2005), transfected cells were also treated with proNGF,
proBDNF, and with a combination of proNGF/proBNDF.
Sortilin downregulation was consistent in both treated and
untreated cells, suggesting that the treatment with proNTs
has no effect on its mutant-related differential expression
(Figure 3(a)­(c)).
The p75NTR mRNA expression is increased in SORT1 p.G171A
mutant cells. Given the role of sortilin in proNGF- and
proBDNF-induced neuronal apoptosis via its interaction
with p75NTR (Nykjaer et al., 2004; Teng et al., 2005) and
the effects of the SORT1 p.G171A mutation on mRNA and
protein expression levels, we sought to determine whether
this mutation may also alter the p75NTR mRNA levels and
the levels of apoptosis. The expression of p75NTR in untrans-
fected cells was first tested by direct qPCR: HEK293 cells
expressed p75NTR, and then examined in both wild-type and
mutant SORT1 transfected cells: p75NTR mRNA levels were
significantly increased in mutant cells when compared with
their wild-type counterparts (Figure 4(a); p < .05, p < .01).
This increase was more significant in cells treated with
proBDNF and proNGF/proBDNF (p < .01). Although a
slightly increase in apoptotic levels was found in p.G171A
mutant cells treated with proNGF and proNGF/proBDNF
together, these differences were not statistically significant
(Figure 4(b)).
PGRN levels are not altered in SORT1 mutant cells or human
mutation carriers. An exciting area of research is the role of
sortilin function in the metabolism of PGRN beacuse sor-
tilin has been shown to regulate extracellular levels of
PGRN in vivo (Hu et al., 2010) and in vitro (Lee et al.,
2013). Thus, to determine whether the SORT1 p.G171A
mutation, which downregulates SORT1 mRNA and protein
levels and upregulates p75NTR mRNA levels, may also be
associated with increased PGRN levels in culture and
human serum samples, PGRN levels were measured by
ELISA. No differences in PGRN levels between wild-
type and mutant cells (Figure 5(a)) and SORT1 p.G171A
mutation carriers versus noncarriers (p ¼ .65; Figure 5(b))
were found.
Discussion
Despite significant efforts made to identify the genetic
basis of ET, the results are limited with linkage,

genome wide association, and candidate gene studies fail-
ing to detect reliable risk and causative alleles for ET.
Here, we examined a family presenting with a mild
form of ET characterized by slow progression and bene-
ficial response to alcohol consumption. A disease-segre-
gating mutation resulting in p.Gly171Ala was identified
in the SORT1 gene through WES analyses. Because the
expression of sortilin is altered in aging of the nervous
system and under pathological conditions (Jansen et al.,
2007), we first investigated whether the SORT1 p.G171A
mutation may also alter sortilin expression levels. A
highly significant reduction of mRNA and sortilin
expression levels was observed in mutant cells when com-
pared with their wild-type counterparts (Figure 3(a) and
(b)), suggesting that the SORT1 p.G171A mutation iden-
tified in our ET patients is implicated in sortilin dysregu-
lation. Since the expression of p75NTR, which binds to
sortilin to mediate neuronal cell death (Nykjaer et al.,
2004) and modulates cholinergic transmission (Yang
et al., 2002), was also found significantly elevated in
mutant cells when compared with wild-type (Figure
4(a)), one may commend that under pathological condi-
tions dysregulation of sortilin may upregulate p75NTR
expression levels. Considering that p75NTR is not only
upregulated in pathological conditions (Nykjaer et al.,
2005) but also in impaired GABAergic transmission
(Riffault et al., 2014), the sortilin deficiency caused by
the p.G171A mutation might also be responsible for
defects in neurotransmission, resulting in both the devel-
opment of tremor and high p75NTR expression.
Given the role of sortilin as a principal neuronal bind-
ing site for PGRN and that a dramatic consequence of
such binding is the rapid endocytosis of PGRN by sortilin
(Hu et al., 2010), extracellular PGRN levels were also
examined. Although PGRN levels were not disrupted in
mutant cells versus wild-type (Figure 5(a)) or in mutation
carriers versus noncarriers (Figure 5(b)), it has previously
been reported that SORT1 mutants known to disrupt
endocytosis do not have altered PGRN levels (Nielsen
et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2010), thus leaving the possibility

that our SORT1 mutation could still affect sortilin-
mediated endocytosis, sorting, and trafficking, regardless
of its effect on PGRN levels.
Lastly, noncoding SORT1 variation has recently been
associated with high cholesterol levels and heart diseases
(Musunuru et al., 2010). There are mounting evidence
that aberrations in cholesterol homeostasis can lead to
severe neurological diseases and impairments in synaptic
plasticity (Lane-Donovan et al., 2014); along these lines,
high levels of serum total cholesterol have been associated
with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease in Finnish
population (Hu et al., 2008). The importance of choles-
terol homeostasis for brain function was first highlighted
by Niemann-Pick type C disease, in which pathogenic
mutations result in impaired cholesterol trafficking and
progressive neurodegeneration (Carstea et al., 1997;
Naureckiene et al., 2000). The association of a specific
apolipoprotein E allele ("4) with the risk for both spor-
adic and familial AD also raised the possibility that dys-
function in the lipid transport system may cause defects
in the brain lipid homeostasis of AD patients (Poirier
et al., 2014). Nowadays, it is known that lipoprotein
receptors, which participate in synapse development,
cargo trafficking, and signal transduction, are key players
in AD pathogenesis and neurodegeneration; indeed, the
association between impaired lipid metabolism and brain
diseases including but not limited to AD, PD and
Huntington's disease is well reported and documented
(Lane-Donovan et al., 2014).
In conclusion, we here identified a disease-segregating
SORT1 mutation in a small family with early-onset ET

mutation is supported by its absence in neurologically
normal population, its prediction as pathogenic by differ-
ent computational programs, its high conservation across
other orthologs (Figure 1(b)), its location in a relevant
functional domain (Figure 1(c)), and its effects on both
sortilin downregulation (Figure 3(a)­(c)) and p75NTR
upregulation (Figure 4(a)). While further research is still
required, given the role of sortilin downregulation and
p75NTR upregulation in central nervous system impair-
ment and neurodegeneration (Harrington et al., 2004;
Jansen et al., 2007; Willnow et al., 2008) and taking into
account that changes in the expression level of p75NTR are
correlated with functional changes in the GABAergic
inhibitory neurotransmission (Blaesse et al., 2009), we
hypothesize that the sortilin deficiency caused by the
SORT1 p.G171A mutation may lead to defects in neuro-
transmission, giving rise to the development of tremor.
