Abstract: Where the non-human animal research investigating reproduction-induced
cognitive reorganization has focused on neural plasticity and adaptive advantage in
response to the demands associated with pregnancy and parenting, human studies have
primarily concentrated on pregnancy-induced memory decline. The current review updates
Henry and Rendell's 2007 meta-analysis, and examines cognitive reorganization as the
result of reproductive experience from an adaptationist perspective. Investigations of
pregnancy-induced cognitive change in human females may benefit by focusing on areas,
such as social cognition, where a cognitive advantage would serve a protective function,
and by extending the study duration beyond pregnancy into the postpartum period.

Introduction
Cognitive re-organization during pregnancy and the postpartum period is complex;
researchers studying both human and non-human females have faced challenges in
describing the pattern of cognitive changes associated with these distinct reproductive
periods. The human literature examining cognitive change in pregnancy is especially
equivocal. Despite a relatively narrow focus on pregnancy-induced memory decline, and
consistent subjective reports of pregnancy-induced memory impairment, researchers have
had a hard time describing actual memory impairment in pregnant women using objective
measures. While some studies have reported a pregnancy-induced memory decline on some
measures (Brindle, Brown, Brown, Griffith, and Turner, 1991; Keenan, Yaldoo, Stress,
Fuerst, and Ginsberg, 1998; Sharp, 1993), other studies have found no difference between
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period

pregnant and non-pregnant women (Crawley, Dennison, and Carter, 2003; Casey, 2000).
Further confusing the picture is still other research that shows specific pregnancy-related
advantages in certain memory tasks (Anderson and Rutherford, 2010; Christensen, Posyer,
Pollit, and Cubis, 1999).
In 2007, Henry and Rendell published a meta-analysis of 14 studies, each of which
included pregnant or postpartum women and a control group. Their review suggested that
the contradictory results with respect to memory decline in pregnant women may have been
caused by the use of different methodologies, the testing of distinct memory processes, and
the small sample sizes often employed in examining cognitive change in pregnant women.
Other researchers have argued that the assumed pregnancy-related decline in memory
performance has been exaggerated, and that subjective reports of a pregnancy-induced
impairment result from cultural expectations of a cognitive deficit in pregnancy (Crawley,
Grant, and Hinshaw, 2008), as well as the expectations of medical caregivers (Jackson,
Schmierer, and Schneider, 1996).
Henry and Rendell (2007) interpreted the results of their large-scale analysis to show
three main findings. First, pregnant women show a real, although subtle, cognitive deficit.
Second, memory tasks that require more effortful processing are more likely to show a
pregnancy-induced impairment. Third, postpartum and pregnant women show similar
patterns of cognitive decline. The current review has two main aims. First, we will examine
the conclusions drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) in light of recent human studies and a
revised meta-analysis, and contrast the conclusions that may be drawn from the current
state of the human literature with what is known about pregnancy and postpartum cognition
in the non-human domain. Next, we examine a small but growing literature that suggests
that there are pregnancy-induced protective mechanisms designed to safeguard the mother
and her fetus. These mechanisms involve physiological responses to nutritional agents,
endogenous responses to mitigate stress reactivity in the pregnant and postpartum female,
and enhanced social cognition, including facilitated processing of faces and emotions. To
date, research on the effects of human pregnancy on cognition have emphasized cognitive
costs or deficits. We consider the possibility that apparent deficits in cognition in
pregnancy and the postpartum period reflect a trade-off whereby cognitive tasks that are
ecologically relevant to their current reproductive phase are facilitated. Moreover, as the
demands of pregnancy transitions into the demands of infant care in the postpartum period,
there is evidence from the non-human animal literature that enhanced cognition during
these periods results in a perpetual cognitive advantage in areas that would promote
maternal or fetal fitness.
A review highlighting recent evidence and suggesting new avenues of future research
is warranted at this time for several reasons. The different conclusions that have been
drawn from the human and non-human literature suggest that researchers investigating
pregnancy-induced cognition in women may benefit from adopting a new perspective: that
of evolutionary psychology. Decades of research exploring memory decline in pregnancy,
without the emergence of a clear picture, suggest that the absence of a functional approach
has made it difficult to formulate testable hypotheses that offer insight into human maternal
cognition. Researchers may be better served by exploring avenues that serve an adaptive
function or offer a survival advantage, rather than assuming cognitive decline as the result
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period

of pregnancy. Much like turning an adaptive lens on the problem of "morning sickness" has
led to its re-conceptualization from pathology to an adaptation designed to protect the
mother and the fetus (Fessler, 2002; Flaxman and Sherman, 2000; Flaxman and Sherman,
2008; Profet, 1992), we suggest that turning an adaptationist perspective on the question of
pregnancy-induced cognitive change may also yield surprising results.
The main aim of this revised meta-analysis was to examine whether Henry and
Rendell's (2007) conclusions are still accurate given that a number of studies have recently
investigated cognitive changes in pregnancy, many of which have tested the conclusions
drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) explicitly (Cuttler, Graf, Pawluski, and Galea, 2011;
Onyper, Searleman, Thacher, Maine, and Johnson, 2010; Rendell and Henry, 2008).
Materials and Methods
Sample of Studies
In order to revise the meta-analysis that was performed by Henry and Rendell (2007)
we followed several of their inclusion criteria, including 1) the studies were written in
English, 2) had to include a sample of pregnant and/or postpartum women and a control
group, and 3) included participants who were in good health and without complicated
pregnancies.
We broadened the inclusion criteria regarding the cognitive measures used in the
studies. While Henry and Rendell (2007) examined pregnancy and memory, we also
investigated general cognition and processing speed. The sample of memory measures used
in the current meta-analysis is also updated. In contrast to the 2007 meta-analysis, we
included prospective memory, which is characterized as the memory for future intentions
(e.g., remembering a previously scheduled doctor's appointment) and is in contrast to
retrospective memory (the memory for past events). We categorized prospective memory
by laboratory and naturalistic prospective memory tasks. For working memory, we did not
limit our analysis to studies that reported backwards digit span; several distinct measures of
working memory have been used to evaluate working memory including backwards digit
span, O-SPAN, and the verbal and non-verbal working memory tasks from the Stanford-
Binet, 5th edition (SB5) (Roid, 2003). In order to discriminate between free recall and
delayed recall tasks we used the same criteria as Henry and Rendell (2007), with the
exception that delayed free recall tasks were those occurring after a delay of 10 minutes,
rather than 15 minutes, and we were, again, more liberal in allowing distinct measures of
recall to be employed. For processing speed we included studies that used digit symbol-
coding, the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), the letter digit substitution test (LDST),
and the speed of comprehension task of the SCOLP (Baddeley, Emslie, and Nimmo-Smith,
1992).
Following Henry and Rendell (2007), we excluded studies that only reported on
subjective measures of cognitive functioning during pregnancy in order to facilitate
comparisons between objective and subjective measures. We also excluded studies that
failed to present adequate statistics for computing an effect size. In the current analysis, we
included 13 of the 14 studies originally included in Henry and Rendell's (2007) meta-
analysis. The exception was McDowell and Moriarty (2000), which was excluded due to
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period

implicit long-term memory being excluded (they did not measure any cognitive tasks that
were included in the current meta-analysis). An additional eight studies were included in
the current revised analysis, bringing the total number of studies used to 21. Appendix A
lists studies that were excluded from the current meta-analysis and the reason for their
exclusion.
Statistical Analysis
Like Henry and Rendell (2007), we prefer to use r as a pooled effect size estimator as
it is commonly used, not only as a correlation coefficient, but also as a standardized
measure reflecting the strength of the relationship between two variables, along with a
random effects model for the same reasons that are listed in their article. In order to
perform the meta-analysis, we used the random-effects method recommended by Hedges
and Vevea (1998), as it has been shown to better control the Type I error rate compared to a
second popular method when the sample size used in the meta-analysis is small (Field,
2001). To make comparisons between this revised meta-analysis and the original meta-
analysis easier, we used the same reporting format that was used by Henry and Rendell
(2007) in the appendices and tables.
Results
Demographic Characteristics
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the participants in each study. The
total sample included in this meta-analysis is 22 studies, consisting of 2,041 participants.
One thousand and ninety-nine women comprised the control group (mean age = 29.59
years, SD = 2.76), 800 women comprised the pregnant group (mean age = 29.62 years, SD
= 1.75), and 342 women comprised the postpartum group (mean age = 29.77 years, SD =
2.02). Table 1 also portrays education and parity statistics (the percentage of women who
have previously given birth at least once) when reported, and notes if the study reported a
significant difference between the pregnant and control participants on any of the
demographic variables. Seven of 21 studies reported a significant difference on at least one
demographic variable of interest (age, education, marital status, household income, parity,
and emotional well-being).

Appendix B portrays the study-level effects for each of the cognitive measures of interest.
When a study reported more than one effect for a given cognitive measure, the mean effect
size for that study was employed in the meta-analysis.
Meta-Analysis
Table 2 portrays the mean effects (M), along with the upper (upper R) and lower
(lower R) 95% confidence intervals, the Fisher transformed variance (tau), the standard
error of the mean (SE), the number of studies used in the analysis (K), the total sample size
(N), and the homogeneity statistic (Q). A negative sign indicates when pregnant or
postpartum women performed worse than control participants.
Working memory. We found a small, albeit significant negative impact of pregnancy
on working memory tasks (mean r = -.07), and a slightly larger trend towards impaired
working memory in the postpartum period (mean r = -.10).
Recall. We found a small negative effect of pregnancy on free recall tasks (mean r = -
.14), and a negligible impact of reproductive status on free recall performance during the
postpartum period (mean r = -.06). Delayed free recall showed a moderate negative effect
of pregnancy (mean r = -.20) and a small impairment when caring for an infant during the
postpartum period (mean r = -.10).
Recognition. We found a significant and positive effect of pregnancy on recognition
memory tasks, and the mean effect size was significant in our analysis (mean r = .14).
Unfortunately, to date no studies have investigated recognition in the postpartum period.
Prospective memory. To date, no studies have investigated prospective memory in the
postpartum period, therefore our analysis is limited to pregnancy. We found a negligible
negative effect of pregnancy for laboratory prospective memory tasks (mean r = -.09), and
a significant small to medium effect of pregnancy for naturalistic prospective memory tasks
(mean r = -.25).
Processing speed. Six studies contributed to our investigation of the impact of
processing speed on pregnancy. Here we found a significant moderate negative effect of
pregnancy (mean r = -.33). Three studies contributed to the investigation of processing
speed during the postpartum period, and here we found a small, non-significant negative
effect of reproductive status (-.07).
General cognition. For general cognitive functioning we found a significant and
small negative effect of pregnancy (mean r = -.13), and a small negative effect during the
postpartum period (-.16).
Subjective memory. Eleven studies contributed to evaluating subjective memory
performance in pregnant women. Here we found a significant and moderate negative effect
of pregnancy (mean r = -.33). No additional studies have examined subjective memory in
the postpartum period, so the mean effect size reported in Table 2 (mean r = -.16) is
identical to the effect size reported by Henry and Rendell (2007).

Publication Bias. As was the case with the 2007 meta-analysis, the results for all
variables which included five or more studies in the current analysis showed no evidence of
publication bias; there is no evidence to suspect that "the file drawer problem" (whereby
there is a bias in the literature towards results that are significant while non-significant
results sit collecting dust in file drawers), is occurring with these data.
Discussion: Revised Meta-Analysis
Is There a Small and Subtle Memory Deficit Associated with Pregnancy?
The first conclusion drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) is that pregnant women
show a subtle memory deficit on some, but not all, memory tasks. The results of our
analysis support their conclusion; both free recall and delayed free recall (DFR), as well as
working memory and naturalistic prospective memory tasks, show a significant negative
effect of pregnancy. Laboratory prospective memory tasks showed a negative effect of
pregnancy that failed to reach significance. In contrast, recognition memory showed a
small, and significant, pregnancy-induced advantage. Taken together, this newly revised
meta-analysis suggests that there is a pregnancy-induced deficit on some, but not all,
memory tasks, with the impact ranging from small to moderate.
Are Pregnancy-Induced Memory Deficits Restricted to Tasks that Require Effortful
Processing?
The second conclusion drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) is that tasks requiring
relatively effortful processing or relating to executive functioning are the most likely to
show a pregnancy-induced disadvantage. Evidence for this conclusion came from
observing that pregnant women seem to have more difficulty with memory tasks such as
free recall and delayed free recall (DFR), and showed more difficulty on tasks of working
memory, which includes an executive processing component, in contrast to memory tasks
that require a storage component only.
We were more liberal in our inclusion of memory tasks that tap working memory,
specifically including memory tasks that place higher demands on executive processes
(such as verbal working memory, SB5). If the conclusion drawn by Henry and Rendell
(2007) is correct, then we should observe increased pregnancy-induced impairment on the
working memory task in the revised meta-analysis; this is not what our results revealed.
The broader inclusion criteria and the inclusion of more studies resulted in a smaller effect
size for working memory (-.07 compared to -.16). Moreover, the pregnancy-induced deficit
that is associated with working memory is less than the pregnancy-induced deficit we
found in general cognitive processing (-.13), which suggests that working memory tasks are
not especially likely to show a pregnancy-induced deficit, but may instead be related to a
subtle and overall cognitive impairment related to pregnancy.
Henry and Rendell (2007) argued that prospective memory tasks would be a strong
test of the claim that memory processes requiring an executive component are more likely
to be impaired during pregnancy. In this meta-analysis we were able to include prospective
memory tasks, both those occurring in the laboratory and those occurring in a natural
setting (i.e., outside the laboratory). Here we found a significant, medium, pregnancy-
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(4). 2012. -668-
induced impairment in tasks of naturalistic prospective memory, and a small, non-
significant effect of laboratory prospective memory tasks. Rendell and Henry (2008) and
Cuttler et al. (2011), report that pregnant women performed worse than non-pregnant
controls on prospective memory tasks outside of the laboratory setting; the authors argue
that the more natural settings, which inherently possess more distractions than laboratory
settings, are more sensitive to pregnancy-induced memory impairment.
The results of the current meta-analysis suggest that naturalistic prospective memory
tasks are impaired during pregnancy, and it may be that the cognitive effort involved in
these tasks is underlying the impairment. However, the inclusion of more difficult working
memory tasks along with a decreased pregnancy-induced deficit compared to the 2007
analysis, suggests that alternative explanations may be more fruitful. It may be that the
observed impairment is the result of motivational, as opposed to cognitive, factors. The fact
that pregnant women are not performing as well as non-pregnant women on naturalistic
prospective memory tasks does not necessarily mean that they are failing to remember the
task. Instead, they may remember the task and then, being distracted by commitments that
occur outside the laboratory setting, assign the task such low priority compared to other
pregnancy-related tasks (e.g., preparing a baby room, finishing work or home projects,
attending doctors' appointments, etc.) that low priority tasks are not completed.
Henry and Rendell (2007) also argue that the pattern of memory deficit observed in
pregnant women is similar to the pattern of memory deficits seen in normal aging.
However, our results show that there are important differences between pregnancy-induced
memory deficit and memory deficit seen in normal aging. While aging populations show
relatively poor performance on laboratory naturalistic prospective memory tasks compared
to younger adults, they show increased performance on naturalistic prospective memory
tasks compared to younger adults (Rendell and Thomson, 1999) - the opposite pattern is
observed in pregnant women. Future investigations of how pregnancy influences
naturalistic prospective memory, as well as exploration of delayed intention in the lives of
pregnant women, may help to describe pregnancy-induced cognitive reorganization, and
explain the subjective memory impairment often reported by pregnant women.
In terms of recall, our results support those drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007),
showing that free recall and delayed free recall (DFR) show a small to moderate negative
effect of pregnancy. Free recall tasks place a greater demand on tasks of executive
functioning and so this offers limited evidence to support their conclusions.
Processing speed
Given that several recent studies have recently shown a late pregnancy-induced
deficit in processing speed (Anderson and Rutherford, in prep; Christensen, Leach, and
MacKinnon, 2010; Crawley et al., 2008; Onyper et al., 2010), we decided to include
processing speed as a target variable of interest in the current meta-analysis. We found that
processing speed showed a significant moderate negative effect of pregnancy, and a small
negative effect in the postpartum period. The pregnancy-induced deficit in processing
speed is much larger than any of the pregnancy-induced deficits in memory reported herein.
Processing speed has been correlated with general intelligence (Vernon and Weese,
1993; reviewed in Sheppard, 2008), and a pregnancy-induced deficit in processing speed
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(4). 2012. -669-
should not be underestimated. Digit symbol-coding, a common measure of processing
speed, is not only or perhaps even primarily a test of processing speed, but also involves a
memory component (Joy, Kaplan, and Fein, 2004). Given that the pregnancy-induced
deficit in processing speed is the biggest negative effect that we found, and that it mapped
very closely to the effect size of subjective memory complaints in both pregnancy and the
postpartum period (mean r processing speed in pregnancy = -.39, mean r subjective
memory in pregnancy = -.33; mean r processing speed in the postpartum period = -.20; and
mean r subjective memory in the postpartum period = -.16), and given that processing
speed is thought to require a memory component, it is possible that this deficit is driving
the consistent reports of pregnancy-induced cognitive decline made by pregnant women
themselves.
Consistent Patterns of Cognitive Performance in Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period
The final conclusion drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) is that there are consistent
patterns of cognitive performance found in pregnancy and the postpartum period. In spite
of an increase in studies included in the current meta-analysis, we still lacked sufficient
data with which to accurately evaluate this claim. Given the limited evidence available, it
seems as though cognitive performance in some areas (working memory and free recall) is
similar during pregnancy and the postpartum period, whereas cognitive performance in
other areas (processing speed) shows a distinct pattern dependent on reproductive phase.
Self-reports of memory impairment also suggest that cognitive performance has improved
in the postpartum period. Future studies investigating cognition in the postpartum period
are necessary.
Pregnancy-Induced Cognitive Change in Women: Summary of Recent Findings
The results of our updated meta-analysis support Henry and Rendell's (2007)
conclusion that pregnant women possess a small cognitive deficit in some areas, such as
recall and naturalistic prospective memory tasks. It is unclear at this point that tasks
requiring relatively effortful processing are more likely to be hindered during pregnancy.
Executive functioning comprises a wide range of cognitive functions, and it may be that
certain tasks of executive functioning are impaired as the result of reproductive state while
other tasks are not. Finally, recent studies investigating cognitive change in the postpartum
period suggest that while performance on some cognitive tasks may be similar during
pregnancy and the postpartum period, other cognitive tasks are differentially impacted by
pregnancy and the postpartum period (prospective memory and processing speed); more
research is needed in order to determine how these distinct reproductive phases influence
cognition.
The current literature emphasizes cognitive decline as the result of reproductive state.
Although new evidence suggests that cognition in pregnancy and the postpartum period
may be impacted in a distinct, and perhaps specialized fashion, the evidence further
suggests that pregnancy results in a mild impairment in general cognitive functioning and
in a variety of memory tasks, and in a moderate deficit in processing speed. These
conclusions are curious in light of recent reviews of reproduction-induced cognitive change
in non-human animals. As shown in the rat literature, the neural plasticity associated with
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(4). 2012. -670-
pregnancy and the postpartum period may result in long-lasting advantages in some
cognitive domains (Kinsley and Lambert, 2008).
Cognitive Reorganization as the Result of Reproductive State
The animal literature emphasizes that activities directly and indirectly related to
maternal care are critical to the survival of both offspring and mother. For example, nest
defense and nursing are important maternal activities, whereas hunting and moving
efficiently to and from the nest are not directly involved in parental care but are
nevertheless critical for the safety and survival of the mother and her offspring. A
distinctive feature of the non-human animal literature is the assumption of cognitive
reorganization rather than of memory decline, underlying these two categories of activities.
Neuroendocrine and neuroanatomical changes observed in the maternal brain are
thought to underlie the behavioral and cognitive advantages exhibited by maternal rats, and
are markers of neural plasticity. The neural plasticity reported in non-human females has
also been found in women. For example, Kim et al. (2010) reported that brain volume
showed changes in grey matter in the first few months postpartum, with an increase in areas
known to be important for parenting. Swain (2011) cites fMRI evidence showing that there
is a biological basis to attachment, and argues that neuroimaging work investigating the
parental response to infants suggests neuronal plasticity in humans. Barrett and Fleming
(2011) argue that although the brain mechanisms that underlie women's behavior are more
complex than those of rodents, there may be neuroanatomical similarities in the pathways
that determine the approach/avoidance behaviors of rats towards pups and the push/pull
that women exhibit towards infants. These works suggest that there are parallels between
human and non-human animals in cognitive reorganization as the result of reproductive
experience, at least in the domain of direct parental activities. More research is needed to
ascertain whether there are also parallels in maternal behaviors that are not directly related
to parental care.
MacBeth and Luine (2010) reviewed cognitive reorganization and anxiety in both
human and non-human animals. Focusing on non-human animals they list several ways in
which rats show cognitive enhancement as the result of reproductive state: enhanced spatial
skills, foraging, and predator detection. Increased spatial cognition has been reported in
pregnancy and in the postpartum period (at least after weaning). Kinsley and Lambert
(2006) also report that pregnant and parous rats show enhanced hunting skills compared to
virgin females. Evidence further suggests that the impact of reproductive experience on
some cognitive tasks, such as long-term memory and some tests of foraging skills, may be
long-lasting (Kinsley and Lambert, 2008; MacBeth and Luine, 2010).
In contrast to the human work that has tended to examine cognition during
pregnancy, much of the rodent work has emphasized the postpartum period, or has
compared nulliparous, primiparous, and multiparous females. The rodent work that has
examined cognition during pregnancy has likewise been equivocal, with some studies
reporting a cognitive advantage in some tasks (Paris and Frye, 2008; Bodensteiner, Cain,
Ray, and Hamula, 2006; MacBeth, Gautreaux, and Luine, 2008) and other studies reporting
a cognitive deficit (Galea et al., 2000). Kim, Chung, Kim, and Lee (2012) also reported a
negative impact of pregnancy on long-term memory, although the cognitive deficit was
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period

attenuated by the physical exercise of swimming.
Although more research is needed in order to fully describe cognitive changes during
pregnancy in humans and rodents, the rodent work has tended to focus on cognitive
reorganization as opposed to memory deficit. We suggest that the narrow focus on memory
decline may be eclipsing potential advantages shared by women. Adopting an evolutionary
perspective may yield important new insights. An adaptationist approach accepts that the
costs associated with pregnancy may result in a cognitive deficit in some areas, but also
recognizes that the potential benefits associated with pregnancy may also result in an
advantage in other cognitive domains. A criticism that may be directed at much of the
current research investigating cognition in pregnancy and the postpartum period is that the
tasks employed are often abstracted verbal tasks that are devoid of ecological validity and
relevance to everyday life. Although naturalistic prospective memory tasks occur outside
the laboratory, this does not necessarily suggest that they are ecologically valid. As such,
pregnant women who are vulnerable and physiologically taxed may not be motivated to
perform. If researchers were to employ tasks that tapped a survival function, or were
relevant to pregnancy or infant-care, the observed pregnancy-induced deficit may
disappear, or may even be overturned into a cognitive advantage; evidence for this claim is
the pregnancy-induced advantage observed in recognition memory.
The current meta-analysis suggests that recognition memory is facilitated during
pregnancy. This positive result of pregnancy is curious given that the other memory
measures showed a small to medium negative impact of pregnancy. It may be that there is
something specific about recognition memory that facilitates cognitive functioning in
pregnant women. Two of the five studies that contributed to calculating the mean effect
size for recognition memory took an explicitly evolutionary approach (Anderson and
Rutherford, 2010; Christensen et al., 1999). When the effect sizes for only these studies are
included, the mean effect size increases from .14 to .26, suggesting a moderate cognitive
advantage. This limited evidence suggests that adopting an evolutionary perspective may
help to pinpoint domains where pregnant women show a cognitive advantage.
There is a growing body of research describing pregnancy-induced advantages in
social cognition. Generating hypotheses informed by these studies may help to further our
understanding of maternal cognitive processes (Anderson and Rutherford, 2010; Navarette,
Fessler, and Eng, 2007; Pearson, Lightman, and Evans, 2009). In the next section we show
evidence of a pregnancy-induced cognitive advantage in women.
Protective Mechanisms in Pregnancy
Pregnancy results in physiological and psychological stress. The relationship between
stress and cognitive performance is complex (reviewed in Roozendaal, 2002), with stress
having been shown to negatively impact some aspects of memory functioning while
facilitating other cognitive tasks. For example, chronic stress has been shown to facilitate
spatial learning and memory (Bowman, Zrull, and Luine, 2001). Moreover, recent evidence
suggests that maternal experience may provide a buffer to the negative effect of stress on
learning (Maeng and Shors, 2012). Although the impact of stress on cognitive functioning
during pregnancy and the postpartum period has yet to be fully described, there is evidence
showing that stress can result in negative consequences for the mother and the fetus.

Further evidence suggests that there are protective mechanisms mitigating the stress
response in both rats and women.
Maternal stress during pregnancy has been shown to have an adverse effect on the
fetus and post-natal infant. Stress and anxiety negatively impact birth outcomes (Dole et al.,
2003; Rondo et al., 2003), including increasing birth complications and the likelihood of
premature birth (reviewed in de Weerth and Buitelaar, 2005). Maternal stress during
pregnancy has also been shown to negatively impact postnatal infant development
(Bergman, Sarkar, O'Connor, Modi, and Glover, 2007; Brouwers, van Baar, and Popp,
2001; Davis and Sandman, 2010; Huizink, Robles de Medina, Mulder, Visser, and
Buitelaar, 2003). A dampened stress response would therefore promote maternal and,
especially, fetal health.
Although the impact of stress on cognitive functioning during pregnancy has not yet
been fully described, the non-human animal literature shows evidence to suggest that there
are mechanisms designed to attenuate stress and anxiety in females with reproductive
experience. MacBeth and Luine (2010) describe several lines of evidence showing that
stress reactivity is specifically mitigated during pregnancy and the postpartum period: both
reproductive states result in decreased neural activation in areas of the brain that are known
to underlie stress and anxiety. Specifically, there is a mitigating effect of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis on hormonal stress effects during pregnancy, pup-exposure
postpartum decreases anxiety in new mothers, and even synaptic connectivity in areas
underlying stress seem to be transformed as the result of pregnancy and the postpartum
period.
The attenuated stress response reported in rats has also been found in human females.
de Weerth and Buitelaar (2005) reviewed stress reactivity and concluded that the stress
response is dampened in pregnancy; blood pressure, heart rate, and cortisol reactivity to a
variety of stressors are mitigated during pregnancy. Glynn, Dunkel Schetter, Wadhwa, and
Sandman (2004) found that women in later pregnancy perceived major life events as less
stressful than women in earlier pregnancy. For example, women who experienced a major
earthquake in late pregnancy reported the event as less stressful than women who
experienced the earthquake in early pregnancy (Glynn, Wadhwa, Dunkel Schetter, Chicz-
DeMet, and Sandman, 2001).
Attenuated stress responses and anxiety during pregnancy are not the only protective
mechanisms associated with pregnancy in women. Morning sickness, now known as
Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy (NVP), was long considered an unpleasant symptom
resulting from pregnancy, but is now believed to protect the fetus from teratogens and other
nutritional agents that may cause harm, and is also thought to protect the mother who is
immunosuppressed during early pregnancy (Fessler, 2002; Flaxman and Sherman, 2000;
Flaxman and Sherman, 2008; Profet, 1992).
Mitigated stress reactivity during pregnancy, along with NVP, show that there are
protective physiological mechanisms designed to keep the mother and fetus safe. A
promising line of research suggests that there are also protective mechanisms in response to
social stimuli: pregnant and non-pregnant women process social stimuli in a distinctive
fashion. Furthermore, the way in which pregnant women process social information is
different, depending on the trimester of pregnancy. For example, Navarette et al. (2007)
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(4). 2012. -673-
showed that pregnant women display increased ethnocentrism and in-group bias in the 1st
trimester of pregnancy. They interpreted their results as reflecting a disease-avoidance
mechanism, arguing that during periods of vulnerability (such as pregnancy) a preference
for in-group and decreased tolerance towards out-group members would decrease the
exposure to pathogens and limit the risk of disease. This study was one of the first to show
that pregnant women process social information in a distinctive fashion that may serve a
protective function. A small but growing body of research examining the effect of
reproductive status on face and emotion processing suggests that certain aspects of social
cognition are enhanced in pregnant females.
Social Cognition in Pregnancy: Face and Emotion Processing
Both menstrual cycle studies and pregnancy studies suggest that reproductive status
influences face and emotion processing. Pearson and Lewis (2005) reported that fear
recognition varies with the menstrual cycle. They found that women are best able to
recognize fear during the pre-ovulatory phase when estrogen levels are high. They
emphasize the importance of fear recognition in social competence. Conway et al. (2007)
reported that when progesterone levels are relatively high (as in pregnancy) women rate
other peoples' fear and disgust as more intense than when progesterone levels are relatively
low. Derntl, Kryspin-Exner, Ferbach, Moser, and Habel, (2008) reported that progesterone
is correlated with accuracy in emotion identification in naturally cycling women; when
progesterone levels are high women show a response bias in identifying negative emotions
as anger or disgust. Like Conway et al. (2007), they interpreted the observed response bias
as a protective mechanism to socially threatening stimuli during pregnancy. Evidently,
there are specialized face processing mechanisms designed to identify physical threat (fear)
and disease threat (disgust), and the way in which women process threat depends on their
menstrual cycle phase.
Studies investigating the processing of social information in pregnant participants
have found similar results to studies investigating the way that naturally cycling women
process social information. Pearson, Lightman, and Evans (2009) reported that pregnant
women show facilitated encoding of emotions denoting threat (anger, fear, disgust) and
sadness, and suggest that there may be a cognitive bias towards threatening stimuli in late
pregnancy. They also argue that vigilance towards emotional cues will result in a survival
advantage. Because anxious individuals have also been found to show enhanced encoding
of emotional expressions, they tested whether relatively high anxiety is a possible
mechanism for enhanced encoding of emotional stimuli during pregnancy. They found no
support for this hypothesis, which should be expected given the mitigated stress reactivity
and anxiety shown to be associated with pregnancy. Pearson et al. (2009) speculate that the
attenuated stress and anxiety response associated with pregnancy allows pregnant women
to benefit from facilitated emotion encoding without the cost associated with increased
anxiety. Anderson and Rutherford (2010) also examined whether pregnant women may
show facilitated processing of social stimuli. They found that pregnant women showed
increased recognition of novel faces, and that this effect was especially pronounced for
same-race male faces. Like Pearson et al. (2009), they argue that facilitated processing of
faces serves a protective function, and that because male conspecifics posed a significant
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period

threat throughout the ancestral past, cognitive mechanisms designed to keep the vulnerable
mother and fetus safe may be expected.
As suggested by the research examining social cognition during the menstrual cycle
and the pregnancy literature, reproductive status and reproductive experience alters the way
women encode threatening social information. Like rats, who show enhanced spatial
learning, foraging, and predator detection abilities while pregnant; human females may also
possess cognitive processes that are species-typical and present an advantage during
pregnancy.
One mechanism thought to underlie enhanced social cognition is increased vigilance
(Anderson and Rutherford, 2010; Pearson et al., 2009). Interestingly, there is limited
evidence that this increased vigilance may aid pregnant women even in evolutionarily
novel situations. Using a simulated driving task, Crawley et al. (2008) investigated whether
driving ability shows a pregnancy-induced deficit. Instead, they found that pregnant women
navigate with increased vigilance, which serves a protective function. Approximately 20%
of the pregnant women in the study reported driving more carefully since becoming
pregnant. In contrast, in comparison to a year ago, over 50% of the non-pregnant women
reported driving more quickly, more frequently, and more impatiently, and none of the non-
pregnant women reported increased caution. Driving performance (number of collisions)
also seems to be affected by pregnancy. Eight of 17 non-pregnant women were involved in
a virtual collision on at least one trial, but only 1 of 13 pregnant women was involved in a
virtual collision. Although Crawley et al. (2008) suggest that the results of this study
should be interpreted cautiously due to small sample size and a lack of controls on previous
experience and driving competence, these results seem to suggest that pregnant women
adopt a more vigilant driving style than their non-pregnant counterparts.
General Discussion
Evidence from studies investigating the impact of reproductive experience on non-
human and human animals suggests that females possess species-typical protective
mechanisms during pregnancy. Just like rats, women also exhibit an attenuated stress
response in late pregnancy. Whereas rats show protective mechanisms designed to facilitate
efficient foraging, hunting, and nest protection, women show protective mechanisms
designed to facilitate some aspects of social cognition. Enhanced social cognition in human
pregnancy may serve multiple roles including efficiently identifying physical threats of
violence from conspecifics, affectively identifying sources of disease, and establishing
alliances. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that increased vigilance may serve to
protect pregnant women and their fetuses even in domains that are evolutionarily novel
such as driving a car.
The results of the current meta-analysis suggest that pregnancy does result in a small,
but significant impairment in some memory measures, including recall and naturalistic
prospective memory. The finding that pregnancy results in a genuine cognitive impairment
is supported by decades of women consistently reporting pregnancy-induced deficits.
However, motivational factors have not been awarded much attention, and it is possible
that pregnant women are lacking the motivation necessary to perform well on cognitive
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period

tasks. Future research could investigate alternatives to actual cognitive impairment in order
to explain the observed performance deficits. Alternatively, as described above, pregnancy
and the early postpartum period result in decreased stress reactivity. A certain degree of
stress is required for optimal performance, and pregnant women have shown attenuated
physiological stress responses to cognitive testing (Matthews and Rodin, 1992; Monk et al.,
2001). It may be that decreased stress reactivity, which serves a protective function, also
results in decreased performance on some cognitive measures. However, it is also true that
pregnant women are able to perform equally well as, or better than, non-pregnant women
on some cognitive tasks, and that even tasks that show a pregnancy-induced impairment
may be buffered by protective mechanisms during pregnancy to help avoid threats.
It may also be the case that the observed cognitive deficit serves an adaptive function.
The fertility and parental care hypothesis describes the relatively poor female performance
on some spatial tasks as serving an adaptive function by decreasing distances traveled from
the nest and thereby increasing female reproductive success (Jones, Braithwaite, and Healy,
2003; Sherry and Hampson, 1997). Support for this hypothesis has been found in rats
(Galea et al., 2000) and voles (Sheridan and Tamarin, 1988). Galea et al. (2000) found that
rats in the third trimester of pregnancy, but not in the first and second trimester, performed
worse than non-pregnant rats on a task of spatial working memory. They suggest a similar
advantage for the observed deficit; staying close to the nest in the third trimester of
pregnancy would mitigate the threat of predation, and conserve energy for parturition. As
has been suggested by Darnaudery et al. (2007), who found a cognitive deficit in
postpartum rats on a task of spatial learning, a cognitive deficit in the postpartum period
may facilitate pup-directed behaviors; enhancing pup-directed behaviors may promote
maternal care and bonding.
A genuine impairment as the result of pregnancy does not undermine the cognitive
reorganization view espoused here. Although the costs associated with pregnancy evidently
result in a cognitive disadvantage in some areas, which is somewhat expected given the
myriad of costs associated with pregnancy, there is also evidence that areas that serve a
protective function for the mother and her fetus are buffered and even facilitated as the
result of pregnancy. An emerging body of research suggests that investigating threat-
detection from an evolutionary perspective may yield the most intriguing insights into
maternal cognition. In comparison to human males, human females show an advantage in
processing social stimuli, including emotions, and this advantage is thought to occur as the
result of the female's role of primary caregiver (Hampson, van Anders, and Mullin, 2006).
Evidently, women who are pregnant show an even greater proficiency in processing
potentially harmful social stimuli in comparison to non-pregnant females. Hence, in some
aspects of social cognition (namely, threat detection), the cognitive advantages being
reported in the rat literature are also observed in human females.
Self-reports suggest that memory impairments are more likely to occur in the latter
half of pregnancy. Likewise, objective measures show decreased performance on some
processing speed tasks in the later stages of pregnancy. However, consistent with the
adaptationist approach we advocate, it is possible that there are protective mechanisms
affecting processing speed; limited evidence suggests that pregnancy does not impair the
processing speed of threatening information. Anderson and Rutherford (2009) reported no
Cognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period

difference in reaction time between pregnant and non-pregnant women in a snakes in the
grass pop-out task, and further found that pregnant women were more accurate than non-
pregnant women at detecting threatening stimuli (spiders) amongst nonthreatening stimuli
(flowers and butterflies). Future research could further investigate processing speed during
pregnancy and the postpartum period, determine whether there is a relationship between the
observed deficit in processing speed and self-reports of cognitive impairment during
pregnancy, and investigate the possibility that there are protective mechanisms facilitating
the speed of threat-detection during pregnancy despite the general pregnancy-induced
impairment in processing speed. This limited evidence also suggests that pregnancy may
result in enhanced processing of threatening social stimuli as well as non-social threatening
stimuli.
In order to describe maternal cognition, researchers should explore the positive
aspects of cognitive functioning as they result from reproductive experience, not just the
negative aspects. Future research could examine more precisely when cognitive
reorganization occurs, describe the cognitive profiles in pregnancy and the postpartum
period, investigate whether cognitive advantages directly linked to infant care occur in
women, and explore whether cognitive reorganization resulting from reproductive
experience lasts in perpetuity, as has been found in non-human animals. In fact, given that
humans are unique in the close contact they share with their offspring, as well as their
offspring's offspring, we may expect that future research will show that cognitive
reorganization and its associated advantages in women are more pervasive and dramatic
than those observed in rats.
