Introduction
Patients' satisfaction (defined as measuring the needs and
wants) has been found to be correlated with the subsequent
use of health services, and influences both patient compli-
ance and the continuity of care (Hall, Milburn, & Epstein,
1993; Linn, 1975; MacStravic, 1991; Xiao & Barber, 2008).
Patient satisfaction with health care has been examined
extensively in different contexts (Crow etal., 2002; Xiao &
Barber, 2008). One common target group has been hospital-
ized patients for at least two reasons. First, admission to a
hospital can be a traumatic and frustrating experience for
many individuals. Second, admission to a hospital can be
associated with high costs for the individual (Quintana etal.,
2006). Patient satisfaction and experiences in the hospital
setting are considered a cornerstone in the evaluation of
health care quality (Danielsen etal., 2010) and have assumed
an even greater significance subsequent to the passage of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of
2010 (P.L. 111-148, Section 3001). Under this section of the
law, the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, financial
incentives are associated with hospitals' performance on the
Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and
Systems (HCAHPS) Survey (Elliott etal., 2012). HCAHPS
became a component of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services'(CMS) Reporting Hospital Quality Data forAnnual
Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program. RHQDAPU
instructs that general acute care hospitals that do not report a
specific set of quality indicators may have up to a 2% reduc-
tion in their annual payment update (Goldstein, Elliott,
Lehrman, Hambarsoomian, & Giordano, 2010).
Patients admitted to hospitals are usually old, and, in
many cases, have multiple comorbidities and pain that may
prevent them from experiencing an optimal stay (Quintana
etal., 2006). In most of these studies, a consistent and sig-
nificant association was found between age and patient satis-
faction with older patients (age 65 and older), expressing
higher levels of satisfaction compared with younger patients

Satisfaction: Inpatient Care Experiences

Abstract
This article examines the extent to which older adult patients' perceptions of inpatient dimensions of care experiences are
associated with their overall satisfaction. A secondary objective is to determine if these specific care experiences differed
between elderly female and male patients. Patient satisfaction data from 6,021 older patients (65 years of age and older)
were collected by using the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey through
telephone interviews of older patients who were recently discharged. Multiple linear regression analyses with older patients'
HCAHPS dimensions (Communication With Nurses, Communication With Doctors, Responsiveness of Hospital Staff,
Communication About Medicines, Cleanliness of the Hospital Environment, and Quietness of Hospital Environment) and
gender were conducted while controlling for self-rated health status, age, race, and education. Multiple linear regression
analysis showed that all of the HCAHPS dimensions were significantly associated with overall satisfaction. Older female
patients reported substantially more positive global evaluations than their male counterparts. However, for older male
patients, Communication With Doctors was more influential in their ratings of overall satisfaction than for older female
patients. For older female patients, Communication With Nurses was more influential in their ratings of overall satisfaction
than for older male patients.

2 SAGE Open
(Peck, 2011). Few studies have examined samples exclu-
sively involving older adults regarding their experiences
with care received during their hospital stay. However, mixed
results have emerged. Some meta-analyses on hospital
patient satisfaction have not shown any gender differences
(Sitzia & Wood, 1997), whereas other studies suggest that
gender differences do appear (Foss & Hofoss, 2004).
Age has consistently been found to be associated with
patient satisfaction scores, with higher age correlated with
higher satisfaction scores (Foss & Hofoss, 2004). Among the
older hospitalized population, this gender difference could
be even more pronounced. Compared with younger patients,
older hospital patients have unique needs for the delivery of
their care. This is mainly due to the inherent heterogeneity
found in this subgroup, the complex health status episodes
experiences and the misconceptions regarding health and ill-
ness that are prevalent in the elderly population (Carter,
McKenna, Martin, & Andrescn, 1989; Ekdahl, Andersson, &
Friedrichsen, 2010). Although patient participation in the
medical decision-making process has been associated with
higher patient satisfaction ratings, research shows that older
patients are more likely to assume a passive role in treatment
decisions (Breemhaar, Visser, & Kleijnen, 1990). This may
be due to the fact that older patients find it more difficult to
process complex medical information and are also less likely
to maintain their emotional equilibrium while receiving such
information (Rahmqvist, 2001).
Hospital care involves inputs from a variety of different
sources such as nursing staff, physicians, staff other than
nurses, and "hotel" amenities such as patient's room. These
attributes form the basis for patient-reported quality of care
surveys. It is unclear from the literature on HCAHPS which
attributes are correlated most with patient satisfaction among
hospitalized elderly patients. The primary objective of this
study was to delineate the contribution of each of the six key
independent variables on overall hospital satisfaction among
elderly patients. A secondary objective is to determine if
these specific care experiences differed between female and
male patients.
Method
Design, Data Source, and Setting
This cross-sectional study was conducted between July 1,
2011, and June 30, 2012. The study collected satisfaction
with care data from 70 hospitals that are members of the larg-
est nonprofit health system in the United States. The 70 hos-
pitals are largely located in the Midwest, Southeast, South,
Northwest, and Northeast, and represent a wide range of hos-
pitals in size, services, and geography. Critical access, com-
munity, and tertiary hospitals are represented in the data set.
The health system uses approximately 150,000 associates
and 40,000 affiliated and employed physicians. Their operat-
ing revenue was US$20.5 billion, and the total assets were
US$31.0 billion. They had 21,936 available beds and showed
759,693 discharges in 2014.
Data Collection Instrument
The data were collected by applying the HCAHPS Survey
instrument to record regular patient experience at each of the
hospitals. HCAHPS was developed by the CMS in collabo-
ration with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) to provide a standardized survey instrument for
measuring patients' perspective on hospital experiences
(Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2013). The
HCAHPS Survey was the first national, standardized data-
base on patients' experiences in short-term, acute care hospi-
tals (Kutney-Lee etal., 2009). HCAHPS data are collected
through the CMS-prescribed data collection protocol and
include the following eligibility criteria: one or more over-
night stays in the hospital, a nonpsychiatric principal diagno-
sis, and alive when discharged (Elliott et
al., 2012). The
HCAHPS also includes additional questions measuring
patient perceptions about aspects of their experience thought
to affect overall satisfaction and loyalty to the hospital pro-
vider. The AHRQ had RAND Corporation, Harvard Medical
School, and American Institutes for Research, together with
Westat, carry out a rigorous, scientific process to develop
and validate the HCAHPS instrument, and the results (psy-
chometric properties including validity and reliability, cred-
ibility, usefulness, etc.) have been confirmed and published
elsewhere (Goldstein, Farquhar, Crofton, Darby, & Garfinkel,
2005; O'Malley, Zaslavsky, Elliott, Zaborski, & Cleary,
2005). Data were collected through telephone interviews
conducted on a constant and regular basis for each hospital.
Patients discharged from one of the hospitals were randomly
selected and contacted (generally within a week), and
responded directly to the survey vendor. The survey vendor
compiled the raw data and sent a data set to the health sys-
tem's central office. Response rates vary by individual hospi-
tal, but across all hospitals, the average response rate was
40%. This high response rate was achieved through the mul-
tiwave survey technique. This study analyzed only those
patients who were 65 years of age or older. For further details
on HCAHPS Survey administration, see HCAHPS Quality
Assurance Guidelines V5.0 (Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services, 2010).
HCAHPS Survey Measures
The HCAHPS Survey yields a series of measures of patients'
hospital experience. Moreover, the survey includes stand-
alone items and global measures. For the purpose of this
study, we selected four composite measures of hospital expe-
rience--Communication With Nurses, Communication With
Doctors, Responsiveness of Hospital Staff, and
Communication About Medicines--each comprised of two
or three individual survey questions. We also added two
Chumbler et al. 3
stand-alone report items (Cleanliness of the Hospital
Environment and Quietness of Hospital Environment). (See
http://www.hcahpsonline.org for the entire survey instru-
ment as well as administration protocols) All of these items
have a standard set of response options: never, sometimes,
usually, and always. The arithmetic mean of these items was
used as a composite index for the independent variable.
Additional independent variables included demographic
characteristics such as the patients' race, gender, age, educa-
tional attainment, and self-perceived health. The race vari-
able was classified as African American, Asian American,
American Indian/Alaska Native, and White. Age was classi-
fied as an ordinal variable consisting of five categories: 65 to
69 years, 70 to 74 years, 75 to 79 years, 80 to 84 years, and
90 years or older. Similarly, educational attainment was cat-
egorized as an ordinal variable: completed eighth grade or
less, completed some high school but did not graduate, grad-
uated from high school or earned General Educational
Development (GED), completed some college or earned
2-year degree, graduated from a 4-year college, and com-
pleted more than a 4-year college degree. Self-perceived
health was measured by asking "How would you rate your
overall health?" The response options were excellent, very
good, good, fair, and poor, and a larger value indicates
poorer health.
The dependent variable, which was derived from the
HCAHPS, included a single item asking respondents to rate
their experience with an overall rating of the hospital with
scores ranging from 0 (worst possible hospital) to 10 (best
possible hospital). Similar to previous authors who have
used HCAHPS, this item was linearly rescaled to a possible
range of 0 to 100 for comparability and ease of interpretation
so that the transformed score y = 100 × (x - a) / (b - a),
where original score x was on a scale from a to b (Elliott
etal., 2012).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics for the respondents and single items
and composite indices are presented in Table 1. Hierarchical
linear regression analysis was used to assess the independent
associations between the older patients' gender, the six
HCAHPS dimensions (hospital experience measures), and
overall patient satisfaction while considering potential hospi-
tal-level nested effects. All six HCAHPS hospital experience
dimensions and gender were entered simultaneously with the
control variables (age, race, self-perceived health, and edu-
cation). Another Level 1 regression model consisted of two-
way interaction terms. The interaction effects were analyzed
by creating a product term for each independent variable
(e.g., Communication With Nurses) and being female (with
being male serving as the reference group) while controlling
for the same background variables. The different combining
processes of patients with gender and each hospital experi-
ence scale were assessed with the significance levels of the
coefficients of the product terms. In all analyses, p < .05 was
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS v. 22.
Results
The descriptive statistics for the older patient characteristics
are presented in Table 1. In brief, the majority of the older
patient participants were female (58.7%). Most of the
patients were White (90.3%). The largest proportion of
patients was found in the 65- to 69-year-old group (25.4%),
followed by the 70- to 74-year-old group (23.4%). With ref-
erence to educational attainment, the most common category
included those who earned a high school diploma or the
equivalent (37.4%). Three in 10 of the respondents rated
their health as "fair to poor."
The descriptive results for the single items and composite
indices are shown in Table 2. The reliability (Cronbach's
alpha coefficients) of each of the composite indices is also
shown in Table 2. Note that the numbers of responses vary
because patients did not respond to all items. All survey
items in the HCAHPS's domains show positive patient

indices demonstrated good reliability (with Cronbach's alpha
coefficients ranging from .621 to .772). The dependent
variable of "overall rating of the hospital" has a mean of
90.78 (range 0-100, with 100 representing the best possible
score) and a standard deviation of 15.01.
Multilevel Regression Results
Table 3 summarizes results from the multilevel regression
model. To assess the nested effect of hospitals, intraclass cor-
relation coefficient (ICC) was obtained.
ICC = 2.717552 / (2.1717552 + 222.907942) = 1.2%. The
value of 1.2% indicates that a small portion (1.2%) of the
total variance occurs between hospitals, and thus, most of
variance occurs within hospitals.
Being an older female patient was associated with an 8.1-
point increase in overall satisfaction after adjusting for hos-
pital experiences, age, race, education, and self-rated health
status. All six hospital experience indicators were signifi-
cantly associated with overall satisfaction. For example,
older patients who reported more positive experiences with
communicating with the doctors and with the nurses were
associated with an 8.8-point and an 8.4-point increase,
respectively, in overall satisfaction. Older patients who
reported a more positive experience with the responsiveness
of the hospital staff were associated with a 4.2-point increase
in overall satisfaction. As compared with patients aged 65 to
69 years, older patients aged 75 to 79 years and those aged 80
to 84 years were associated with a 1.2-point and 1.4-point
increase in overall satisfaction.
Table 3 also presents the statistically significant interac-
tion terms from the model. For the older patients, a positive
and statistically significant interaction effect was found for
nursing care and being a female patient. In other words, for
older female patients, relationship with nurses was more
important in their ratings of overall satisfaction, compared
with older male patients. Conversely, a negative and statisti-
cally significant interaction effect was found for physician
care and being a female patient. That is, for older male
patients, relationship with physicians was more important in
their ratings of overall satisfaction than for older female
patients. The two interaction terms (Responsiveness of
Hospital Staff Care × Gender, Communication About
Medicines×Gender,CleanlinessoftheHospitalEnvironment
× Gender, and Quietness of Hospital Environment × Gender)
were not statistically significant.
The last column in Table 3 also shows the level of statisti-
cal significance for gender and inpatient dimensions of care
experiences, and overall satisfaction. The statistically sig-
nificant hospital-specific care experience correlates, in order
of importance, were Communication With Doctors (p <
.0001), Communication With Nurses (p < .0001),
Responsiveness of Hospital Staff (p < .0001), Cleanliness of
the Hospital Environment (p < .0001), Quietness of Hospital
Environment (p < .0001), and Communication About
Medicines (p < .0001). Overall, all of the variables accounted
for 47% of the variance in hospital rating.

Discussion
In this study, we examined reports of patients' perceptions of
their hospital experience, specifically among older (65 years
and older) individuals. More specifically, this is one of the very
few studies that examined the relationship between six key hos-
pital attributes--Communication With Nurses, Communication
WithDoctors,ResponsivenessofHospitalStaff,Communication
About Medicines, Cleanliness of the Hospital Environment, and
Quietness of Hospital Environment--and overall patient
satisfaction in a large, geographically dispersed U.S. sample of
hospitalized elderly patients. Assessing patient satisfaction is
salient because it measures how hospitalized older patients feel
about the care they receive. Hospital experience and overall sat-
isfaction was measured by HCAHPS, the first national, stan-
dardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for
assessing patients' perceptions of their hospital experience in
the United States (Goldstein et
al., 2010). Secondarily, we
investigated if these specific care experiences differed between
elderly female and male patients. Our findings indicate that all
six hospital experience measures were significantly associated
with overall satisfaction. However, all six were not equally
influential. These findings further suggest that a one-size-fits-all
strategy to improve patient overall rating of the hospital would
not work well. The regression model in the present study
explained 47% of the variation in overall patient satisfaction.
This explanatory power is comparable with other studies that
have incorporated patient-reported experiences and sociodemo-
graphic variables as predictors (Bjertnaes, Sjetne, & Iversen,
2012).
Overall, Communication With Doctors was the strongest
correlate of overall satisfaction, with the second most influ-
ential being Communication With Nurses. These findings are
similar to a Norwegian study of 63 hospitals in five health
regions, which found that experiences with nursing services
and experiences with doctor services were the most impor-
tant predictors of patient satisfaction for hospitalized patients
(Bjertnaes etal., 2012). Thus, the communication with pro-
viders (both physicians and nurses) more than the other
domains is more important with overall satisfaction, a find-
ing consistent with other studies (Andersen, Rice, &
Kominski, 2001). Furthermore, older patients have a better
experience with their hospital care when the hospital envi-
ronment is both clean and quiet.
We also found that older female patients reported consid-
erably greater overall satisfaction than their male counter-
parts. This finding is contrary to a previous study with
HCAHPS data, which found that female patients tended to
report worse experiences than men (Elliott etal., 2012). A
plausible reason for the difference in the finding is that our
study specifically examined patients 65 years or older,
whereas Elliott and colleagues (2012) used patients 18 years
or older at time of admission. Moreover, our data were more
recent (collected from the period 2011-2012), whereas Elliott
etal.'s (2012) study used data from the period 2007-2008.
This study found that patients combined their attribute
reactions differently depending on their gender. For older
male patients, Communication With Doctors was more influ-
ential in their ratings of overall satisfaction than for older
female patients. This finding suggests that when a hospital
admits patients who are older men, the hospital needs to con-
sider and maintain optimal communication by physicians.
Conversely, the present study found that for older female
patients, Communication With Nurses was more influential
in their ratings of overall satisfaction than for older male

patients. These findings are in contrast to some studies that
found that women report less positive interactions than men
with nurses but better interactions with physicians (Elliott
etal., 2012). The clear gender differences in our study under-
score the need for a gender-sensitive approach in the encoun-
ters between older male and female patients by physicians
and nurses, respectively (Foss & Hofoss, 2004). The remain-
ing four other HCAHPS patient experience domains and
gender interaction effects were not statistically significant.
Among the other independent variables, age and educa-
tional attainment were found to be statistically significant.
For the age variable, the age groups of 75 to 79 and 80 to 84
years were found to report greater overall satisfaction than the
reference age group of 65 to 69 years. In other words, patients
aged 75 to 84 years were more likely to rate their overall hos-
pital stay as positive compared with patients aged 65 to 69
years. In terms of educational attainment, greater educational
attainment tended to be inversely associated with overall sat-
isfaction. As compared with those with less than an eighth-
grade education, patients in the following groups had lower
satisfaction scores: high school (or equivalent), some college,
a 4-year college education, and more than a 4-year college
education. For instance, respondents with a 4-year college
education, the group with the strongest magnitude, were asso-
ciated with a 2.77-point decrease in overall satisfaction.
Study Limitations
Some important caveats of the present study need to be men-
tioned. First, the cross-sectional design of this study does not
inform us about causation. Future research should use longitu-
dinal designs that would better assess causality in addition to
unmeasured variables. Second, our analysis was limited to a
certain number of hospitals that voluntarily submitted
HCAHPS data during the time frame delineated in the study.
In other words, the hospitals used in the present study may not
be representative of all hospitals in terms of location and bed
size. As reported elsewhere (Lehrman etal., 2010), rural hos-
pitals with fewer than 100 beds and those in the Plains region
were underrepresented among hospitals that voluntarily par-
ticipated in the HCAHPS data reporting. Third, we were
unable to control for the consumers' attitudes toward physi-
cians and nurses before their hospital stay. Future research
should collect data that examine consumers' attitudes before
and after their hospital stay. From a health plan perspective, an
ultimate outcome measure of patient satisfaction is whether or
not enrollees choose to switch plans (Cunningham & Kohn,
2000). Future studies can use the patient satisfaction data as a
predictor of plan switching in older hospitalized adults.
Fourth, the data available precluded us from considering
patient loyalty ("a personal commitment that contributes, or at
least can be expressed in terms of contributions, to the success
and survival of a health care provider, either an individual prac-
titioner or an organization"), an important variable linked to
overall satisfaction (MacStravic, 1991, p. 61). Hospital loyalty,
expressed as intention to return to or recommend the hospital
they used most recently, is typically reported to be quite high.
However, the intention to return to a hospital tends to fade with
time, subject to significant attrition in 3 to 6 months, and such a
decision differs between men and women (Fisk, Brown,
Cannizzaro, & Naftal, 1990). Future research should consider
loyalty and, in particular, differences between men and women.
Finally, our data precluded us from controlling for a series of
patient health status characteristics. With the exception of self-
rated health status, we were unable to control for other health-
related variables of the patients, including number of admissions
in the past year or so and length of stay in the hospital.
Implications
Despite these study limitations, our data have distinct value
and offer some important implications. Our study is one of
the few that described older patient hospital experiences and
satisfaction with care by using a validated HCAHPS instru-
ment among a large U.S.-based private, not-for-profit hospi-
tal system. Findings from our study have implications for
treating geriatric patients. Overall assessments of older
patients in hospitals can be improved by assuring good com-
munication by nurses and doctors, as well as maintaining
responsiveness of staff to older patients' needs and ensuring
clear communication by staff.
It is plausible that findings from this study may be attrib-
uted to multiple factors found in the older adult patient popu-
lation such as previous experiences with inpatient care, a
relatively low level of knowledge regarding medical issues,
and a strong tendency to provide socially acceptable
responses to survey questionnaires. Some studies suggest
that the positive perception of health care quality in older
patients could possibly stem from the fact that health care
providers are in reality more responsive to their needs result-
ing in a more patient-centric experience (Bjertnaes et
al.,
2012). Behavioral research has shown that older patients are
less demanding and more prone to resigning themselves to
their fate. Thus, lower expectations and higher acceptance of
their condition may also influence overall satisfaction with
hospital care among older adults.
