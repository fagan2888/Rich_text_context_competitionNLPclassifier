Validity of Demographic Characteristics on the Death Certificate

Paul D. Sorlie,1 Eugene Rogot,1 and Norman]. ]ohnson2



In a sample of the United States population from the Census Bureau's Current Population Surveys, we compared demo­ graphic characteristics with those recorded on the death certificate for the 43,000 decedents in the sample followed from 1979 to 1985. Overall percentage agreements were: Sex 99.5, Race 99.4, Place of birth 99.4, Hispanic origin 98.7, and

Veteran status 95.2. Relatively fewer American Indians and Asian/Pacific Islanders had death certificates that agreed with the baseline race (73.6% and 82.4%, respectively). The direc­ tion of disagreement suggests that current estimates of mor­ tality rates for American Indians and Asian/Pacific Islanders are underestimated. (Epidemiology 1992;3:181-184)

With all of its imperfections, the death certificate continues to be the key document used in describing the distribution and causes of death by age, sex, race, and other demographic characteristics. To estimate death rates without bias, the demographic character­ istics as well as the causes of death need ro be recorded in a valid and reliable manner.
The   National  Longitudinal  Mortality  Study 1 has
identified those deaths that occurred in 1979-1985 in a large sample of the United States population. Social,

economic, and demographic characteristics of each person in the sample were determined at the beginning of follow-up and compared with the same characteris­ tics as recorded on the death certificate. We favor the baseline classification as being the more accurate mea­ sure because it is obtained directly from the head of household in a standardized survey and is thought to be more valid than the death certificate information recorded by a hospital, funeral director, or coroner in an unstructured and unstandardized manner.

Methods
The National Longitudinal Mortality Study assembled 12 Current Population Surveys from the Bureau  of the Census and matched survey records to the National Death Index for the years 1979 through 1985. The surveys. were designed to obtain information from a

complex probability sample of the United States on many social, economic, and demographic characteris­ tics. Only three surveys collected information required for all analyses (see Table l); however,  since  each  of the 12 samples was collected in a similar manner, inclusion or deletion of a survey  file should  not  bias any results. These surveys were conducted by a per­ sonal interview with the most knowledgeable adult member of the sampled household .
Information collected by the interviewer included:

What is the race of each person in this household? [White; Black; American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; Asian or Pacific Islander]
What is the origin or descent of each person in this house­ hold? [Countries or ethnic designations including all His­ panic origins]
Did ....ever serve on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces? What is the place of birth of each person in this household? [State or country of birth]

We matched records from these surveys to those of  the National Death Index, a computer file of deaths maintained by the National Center for Health Statis­ tics. Thirteen personal identifiers were used to deter­ mine a correct match.2 A match could be correct even though sex, race, or place of birth did not agree with the certificate. For the 7 years of follow-up between 1979 and 1985, we identified 43,520 deaths.
  We calculated overall agreement rates as the number of deaths in which each category at baseline agreed with the corresponding category from the death cer­ tificate, divided by the total number of deaths with known characteristics and expressed as a percentage. Percentage agreement is also presented for specific categories where the denominator is the total number of deaths in that category as defined by the baseline classification.

Results
The agreement between demographic characteristics was evaluated for at least 21,000 deaths (Table 1). The number of missing values at the baseline determination and death certificate is low except for veteran status (20.3% of male death certificates) and Hispanic status (72.8% of death certificates). At the time of the deaths, 1979-1985, Hispanic status was included as an item on the certificate in 21 states. Veteran status was included in all but five states and New York City. The overall Current Population Survey-death certificate agree­ ment between the specific items for a characteristic was high (Table 1).
  In Table 2, White and Black categories show good agreement (99.2 % and 98.2%, respectively), but the classification of American Indian and Asian/Pacific Islanders is much more susceptible  to  error  (73.6% and 82.4%, respectively). The largest discrepancy  is for a baseline determination of American Indian or Asian/ Pacific Islander to be categorized as White on the death certificate. The rates of agreement do  not  appear  to vary much by sex or age group of the decedent (not shown).
  Calculation of death rates by race in the U.S. ordi­ narily uses the racial classification from the death certificate (numerator)  and  the  population  frequency by race as determined  by  the  Census  (denom  inator). In this study, the numerator of the death rate  is analogous to the column totals of Table 2, whereas the row totals represent deaths classified in  a  manner similar to the denominator of the  death  rate. The  ratio of the row to the column  total  gives an  indication  of the bias in the usual calculation of the death rate. The
U.S. death rate for American Indians as commonly calculated should be multiplied by a factor of 1.22 (216/177) and the Asian/Pacific Islander death rate should be multiplied by a factor of 1.12 (272/ 242).

  A detailed comparison of agreement of  Hispanic status is shown in Table 3. For the broad  classification of Hispanic, the death certificate is in agreement 89.7% of the time. For the more specific classes of Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban, the agreement is between 80 and 86%. If the baseline classification is Other His­ panic, then the agreement is much lower, at 47.6%. These agreement rates do not vary  much  by  sex  or race of decedent (not shown).
  Table 4 shows the agreement for place of birth. For those born in the United States, 99.5% of death certificates agree with the baseline; 97.3% of certificates

agree with the  baseline  classification of born  outside of the U.S.


Discussion
The 1960 Census-Death Certificate Matched Records Study provides the most comprehensive comparison of data on the death certificate with data derived from an independent source 3 and provides a benchmark for the National Longitudinal Mortality Study validation of data from the years 1979-1985. Of the many char­ acteristics that were evaluated in the 1960 study, the

results for race and nativity can be compared with the National Longitudinal Mortality Study study.
The agreement rates for race in the 1960 data are
slightly higher than those from the current study. The percentage agreement with the Census-recorded race are as follows (National Longitudinal Mortality Study agreement in parentheses): White 99.8 (99.2); Black 98.2 (98.2); American Indian 79.2 (73.6); Asian 91.5 (8 2.4). There are slight study differences in racial defi­ nition . The 1960 data do not include Aleut or Eskimo in the American Indian classification, nor do they include Pacific Islanders (other than Filipinos) in the Asian group.
  Mortality by nativity currently shows that the for­ eign born have lower death rates than do native born.1 4 The percentage agreement rates in the 1960 study were as follows (National Longitudinal Mortality Study agreement in parenthe ses): native born 98.1 (99.5); foreign born 98.3 (97.3). The 1960 Matched Records Study indicated that the Census classified fewer as foreign born than did the death certificate data. In the current study, the total number of deaths classified as foreign born by the Current Population Survey is only slightly less than the number classified by the death certificate (Table 4).
  Recent reports on mortality among Hispanics have also used a combination of death certificate and base­ line Census information  to  generate  mortality  rates.5 6 In a study in New Mexico,5 Hispanic status was derived from names and other information on the death cer­ tificate. Agreement between baseline and this derived classification was 96.4% as compared to 89.7% in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study  study.  This result suggests that a derived classification  may  be better than the death certificate classification of His­ panic status.
  In U.S. Vital Statistics data, age-adjusted all-cause mortality of American Indians is the same as for  the total U.S. population.7 Misclassification of death cer­ tificate race could bias racial comparisons. Our  Na­ tional Longitudinal Mortality Study data showed an age-adjusted mortality ratio of 1.29 for American In­ dians. A study of Seneca Nation Indians in New York,

not subject to bias from racial misclassification, showed an age-adjusted standardized mortality ratio of 124 for men and 106 for women.8 In a study that matched death certificates to birth certificates, the ratio of American Indian birth:death classification was 1.39.9 The National Longitudinal  Mortality Study sample is a complex multistage design. When weights are applied to the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, the ratio of baseline:death certificate classification of American Indian changes from 1.22 to 1.30. Since the National Longitudinal Mortality Study sample is drawn from the noninstitutionalized population only, inferences to the entire U.S. population cannot strictly be made. Nevertheless, the National Longitudinal Mortality Study data do suggest that the current American In­ dian death rate may be underestimated in the neigh­ borhood of 22- 30% .
