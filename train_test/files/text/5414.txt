Introduction
Sexual crimes by adolescents are a serious problem in the
United States. It has been reported that sexual victimization
is widespread, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 25% for
womenand15%formen(Barbaree,Marshall,&McCormick,
1998; Nelson, 2007). Public awareness and concern about
the problem of sexual violence has increased because of the
escalating incidences of sexual crimes (Brown, 1999;
Sanghara & Wilson, 2006). The attitude of the general public
toward sexual offenders appears to be highly negative
(Carone & LaFleur, 2000; Nelson, 2007; Rash & Winton,
2007; Valliant, Furac, & Antonowicz, 1994). A significant
number of adult sexual offenders began their criminal
offenses during adolescence, and sexual crimes by children
against children are contributing to the rising incidence of
sexual crimes (Lakey, 1994; Van Outsem, 2002; Van Outsem
et al., 2006; Verheij, 2000).
The U.S. juvenile justice system has responded to sexual
crimes by imposing incarceration sanctions, emphasizing
counseling rather than punishment (Nelson, Herlihy, &
Oescher, 2002; Zimring, 2002). Consequently, a significant
number of adolescent sexual offenders have been adjudi-
cated to residential treatment programs. This situation chal-
lenges counselors working in residential treatment programs
to examine their own feelings about sexual abuse and those
who perpetrate this behavior (Nelson et al., 2002; Polson &
McCullom, 1995).
Minimal attention has been paid to counselors' attitudes
toward adolescent sexual offenders working in residential
treatment programs, and the relationship of these attitudes to
counselors'experiences, training, gender, and age.As Nelson
et al. (2002) stated, "it is important for counselors to discover
factors that influence their perception of sexual offenders
because their perceptions may cause them to view sex
offenders as criminals needing punishment instead of clients
needing counseling" (p. 51).
In the recent years, there has been a limited amount of
research into the attitudes of mental health counselors toward
sexual offenders. Clinicians and researchers have noted the
important role maladaptive attitudes and distorted thinking
play in facilitating or justifying sexual offenses (Abel,
Becker, & Cunningham-Rathner, 1984; Marshall & Barbaree,
1990; Murphy & Stalgaitis, 1987; Stermac & Segal, 1989).
These attitudes and cognitive distortions function to avoid

An Examination of Counseling
Professionals/Paraprofessionals Attitudes
Toward Adolescent Sexual Offenders
Edward C. Jones1
Abstract
One hundred thirty-three counseling professionals/paraprofessionals were recruited from adolescent residential treatment
programs located in Michigan. Participants were assessed using the Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offender Scale
(CATSO). Of the participants, 32.3% (n = 43) of the participants were female and 67.7% (n = 90) were male. Years
of experience working directly with adolescent sexual offenders of participants ranged from 0 to 18 years (M = 2.48
years, SD = 3.48). The number of months participants received sexual offender training ranged from 0 to 60 (M = 3.44,
SD = 9.48). No statistical differences in attitudes were found between females and males toward adolescent sexual offenders.
No statistically significant relationship was found between years of experience and the four factors on the CATSO survey
(Social Isolation, Capacity to Change, Severity/Dangerousness, and Deviancy). A significant relationship was found between
experience and the Deviancy factor. No statistically significant relationship was found between months of training and
attitudes. Overall, attitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders were positive.

negative self-evaluation and social disapproval, and facili-
tate the disengagement of the offender's inhibitions regard-
ing sexual offending (Stermac & Segal, 1989; Ward, Hudson,
& Marshall, 1995). Inevitably, professional attitudes toward
sexual offenders, and other deviant populations, affect social
service delivery and, in particular, the nature and the quality
of services provided (Ward, Connolly, McCormack, &
Hudson, 1996; Ward et al., 1995). According to Hogue
(1993), assessment of the professional's general attitude is
necessary to successful therapeutic intervention, as it is
likely to influence the client's response to change. It could
also be argued that professional attitudes toward sexual
offenders significantly affect other services for victims of
abuse and those associated with them, because such attitudes
can become part of the framework of expert knowledge
(Ward et al., 1995; Ward et al., 1996).
Research interest into professional attitudes and beliefs
toward sexual offenders, while developing in recent years,
remains limited. Stermac and Segal's (1989) study into cog-
nitive factors surrounding adult sexual contact with children
generated considerable debate when it compared sex offender
and professional attitudes in this area (Murphy, 1991; Ward
et al., 1996). The study, while largely focusing on sexual
offender cognitions, also suggested that some clinicians
(social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and nurses)
may view adult sexual contact with children to be a partial
benefit to the child (Stermac & Segal, 1989). Murphy (1991)
argued that if this finding is replicated, it raises serious con-
cerns about the adequacy of education in the sexual abuse
area. Hanson, Gizzarelli and Scott (1994) study of profes-
sional reactions to child molesters' behaviors noted the need
for professionals to be aware of offenders' strategies for
externalizing blame and generating sympathy. According to
Ward et al. (1996), the failure to do so may result in inadver-
tent collusion with offenders' cognitive distortions and inef-
fective therapy.
Other studies examining professional attitudes regarding
child sexual abuse have generally considered comparisons
between professional groups within the practice field
(Murphy, 1991; Ward et al., 1996). Saunders (1988) com-
pared attitudes toward child sexual abuse among social
workers and professionals within the judicial system.
Statistically significant differences were found across the
groups. Social workers, the police, and district attorneys
were found to be strong advocates for victims, while public
defenders showed themselves to be strong advocates for
alleged offenders, and judges held more neutral attitudes
than any other group. Saunders concluded that conflict
remains between professionals on the most appropriate way
to deal with sexual abuse cases.
In a similar study, Trute, Adkins, and MacDonald (1992)
found that there were significant differences in the attitudes
of police in comparison to child welfare workers and com-
munity mental health personnel. Police officers did not think
that sexual abuse was as widespread or affected victims as
seriously, and viewed sexual offenders as a more deviant
group than did the child welfare personnel. The police offi-
cers also viewed treatment as more ineffective in curtailing
child sexual abuse than other groups. Interestingly, these dif-
ferences were moderated by the gender of the various profes-
sional groups. Women tended to view sexual abuse as more
pervasive, treatment as more effective, and sexual offenders
as a heterogeneous group coming from all spheres of society
(Trute et al., 1992). These findings raised the question of
whether gender is active in shaping professional belief sys-
tems, or whether the professional role over time shapes per-
ceptions and beliefs of the workers involved (Ward et al.,
1995; Ward et al., 1996).
In a study conducted by Farrenkopf (1992), 24 mental
health counselors between 10 and 30 years of experience
counseling sexual offenders were surveyed following pilot
interviews. Female counselors reported feelings of increased
vulnerability, paranoia, and vigilance regarding male sexu-
ally aggressive behavior compared with male counselors.
Polson and McCullom (1995) conducted a qualitative
study with several counselors who specialized in the treat-
ment of sexual offenders. Counselors interviewed worked
with sexual offenders and victims of sexual abuse. Four gen-
eral themes describing counselor attitudes and behavior
emerged from the interviews: (a) developing a positive view
of perpetrators, (b) managing dysfunctional client behaviors
and beliefs, (c) controlling personal reactivity, and (d) limita-
tions of counseling. In developing a positive view, counsel-
ors described constructing cognitive frames that view sexual
offenders as vulnerable, impaired, or human. It was also
helpful to view the offenders as victims, realize that their
families still loved them, defend their right to treatment, and
view them as individuals with problems (Polson &
McCullom, 1995). Polson and McCullom's study confronted
sexual offenders'victim blaming and prodded them to accept
responsibility for their actions. If the offender did not admit
responsibility, the counselors worked to control their own
verbal or nonverbal expressions of disgust. They also coped
by co-counseling in-group work and tried to be nonjudgmen-
tal, control personal issues, and be appropriate role models.
Carone and LaFleur (2000) studied 236 student counsel-
ors enrolled in one of eight counselor education master's
degree programs. They found that sexually abused student
counselors desired to see physically abused offenders more
than they desired to see a non-abused offender. They con-
cluded that counselors should understand how their own
backgrounds influence their desire to see sexual offenders
and the possible effect on the counseling outcome.
Nelson et al. (2002) conducted a study investigating
counselors' attitudes toward sexual offenders. There were
437 counselors participating in this study who were mem-
bers of the Association for Mental Health Counselors and
the International Association of Addictions and Offenders
Jones 3
Counselors. The participants completed the Attitudes
Toward Sex Offender Scale (ATS; Hogue, 1993) and pro-
vided personal background information. The results from
this study indicated that counselors tended to have positive
attitudes toward sexual offenders and that experience, prep-
aration from training, and victim status were related to these
positive attitudes.
More recently, Ferguson and Ireland (2006) conducted a
comparison study, investigating the attitudes toward sexual
offenders, using 139 participants (49 students and 90 foren-
sic staff). The participants were provided with vignettes
depicting specific sexual offenses and were asked to com-
plete a scale assessing attitudes toward sexual offenders. The
results of the study indicated that forensic staff were more
likely than students to view sexual offenders in positive
terms, viewing them as individuals who could be rehabili-
tated. Participants who reported being victims of sexual
abuse, or that someone close to them had been abused,
viewed sexual offenders less negatively than nonvictims.
Men demonstrated less positive attitudes toward child incest
and child indecent assault offenders than to stranger rapists.
Women held more positive views toward sexual offenders
than men, and this was consistent across offense type.
In a recent study, Balow and Conley (2008) used the
Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offender Scale (CATSO)
to examine the attitudes of 307 professional correction work-
ers. The population sample for this study consisted of parole
and probation officers, prerelease center workers, adminis-
trative staff, client advisors, licensed addiction counselors,
and registered nurses and case managers. The results of the
study yielded a representative portrayal of perceptions across
diverse concepts of relative sex offenders. While the partici-
pants in this study perceived the sex offender population to
be dangerous, they clearly agreed that offenders are amena-
ble to rehabilitation. Participants did not differ in their
responses regarding the severity of a sex crime based on
whether the perpetrator knew the victim and perceived that
emotional control is not substantially different than physical
control. With regard to wearing tracking devices, most
agreed that they should, but opinions on this item were not
particularly strong (Barlow & Conley, 2008). It was likely
that the real world logistics of this affected opinions. One
limitation of this study was the lack of demographic informa-
tion of participants. For example, no differences could be
made regarding the differences in attitudes among male and
females, types of correction professionals, experience, train-
ing, or within different parts of the region in which the study
was conducted (Barlow & Conley, 2008).
The aforementioned studies focused on the attitudes
counseling professionals and students had toward adult sex-
ual offenders. However, no study to date known to the
researcher has specifically examined counseling profession-
als/paraprofessionals' attitudes toward adolescent sexual
offenders.
Literature Review
Attitude of the Public
Levey and Howells (1994) asserted that the formal and infor-
mal sources of information such as schools, family, peers,
and the media have a significant impact on attitudes toward
sexual offenders. Early community notification strategies
commonly included press releases, flyers, and door-to-door
warnings about the presence of sex offenders (Levenson &
Cotter, 2005; Matson & Lieb, 1997). Because states are now
federally mandated to post their sex offender registries online,
however, the Internet appears to have become the primary
source of information about convicted sex offenders (Smith,
Wampler & Reifman, 2005). The goals of sex offender regis-
tration and notification are to increase the public's awareness
of sex offenders and to help people protect themselves and
their children from sex crimes (Proctor, Badzinski, &
Johnson, 2002; Szymanski, 2009; Wright, 2003).
Research on public attitudes suggests that students
(Valliant et al., 1994), police officers (Weekes, Pelletier, &
Beaudette, 1995), and prison officers, not involved in sexual
offender care (Hogue, 1993), hold negative attitudes toward
child sexual offenders. Specifically, they are viewed as dan-
gerous, harmful, violent, tense, bad, unpredictable, mysteri-
ous, unchangeable, aggressive, weak, irrational, afraid,
mentally ill, and morally wrong (Valliant et al., 1994; Weekes
et al., 1995).
A public opinion survey in Washington indicated that
80% of 400 residents surveyed in 1997 were familiar with
community notification policies, commonly known as
Megan's Law, and that 80% of that group believed that the
law was very important (Hindman, 1997; Valliant et al.,
1994). The majority reported that they felt safer knowing
where convicted sex offenders lived and speculated that
community notification might help offenders better manage
their behavior because neighbors were watching them.About
half of the respondents acknowledged the potential for vigi-
lantism and 75% agreed that notification might make it more
difficult for sex offenders to reintegrate into communities
with regard to housing, jobs, and social support (Valliant et
al., 1994). Females were significantly more likely than males
to be frightened or angry about sex offenders moving into the
neighborhood. Age was also a significant factor in the level
of fear reported, with 30- to 40-year-olds expressing more
concerns than those over 50 or under 30 (perhaps because
those in their thirties are more likely to have young children).
Interestingly, however, more than half of the parents reported
no change in their own behaviors with regard to supervision
of their children as a result of community notification
(Valliant et al., 1994).
According to Cochrane and Kennedy (2010), the News of
the World surveyed a random sample of 558 young adults
between the ages of 18 and 24. Respondents were
4 SAGE Open
overwhelmingly (86%) in favor of the public having access
to information about registered sex offenders. More than half
(57%) believed that the public has a right to know about all
convicted child molesters living in the local area, while 29%
believed that the public should be told only about those
judged to pose a risk to children. Only 16% of those sur-
veyed believed that convicted child molesters could live
safely in a community without posing a threat to youngsters.
Despite their support for community notification, only 11%
indicated a belief that children are safer now than they were
5 years ago, and 69% did not believe that enough was being
done to protect potential victims from sex offenders
(Cochrane & Kennedy, 2010).
Parents and concerned neighbors often describe the goal
of community notification as "providing as much informa-
tion as possible to safeguard against any potential threats
posed by sex offenders" (Hindman, 1997, p. 232). However,
some residents have reported that notification actually
increased their anxiety because information about offenders
is not usually accompanied by information about protecting
oneself or one's children from assault (Caputo, 2001;
Zimring, 2002). A telephone survey of 250 residents in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama, who had experienced sex offender
notification, found that females and parents of minor chil-
dren were more likely than males and nonparents to feel that
community notification was important (Caputo, 2001).
Parents and women expressed more fear of crime, in general,
and of sexual assault, specifically (Caputo 2001).
In 2005, after the widely publicized murder of 9-year-old
Jessica Lunsford by a convicted sex offender in Florida, the
state of Florida became the first to pass "Jessica's Law,"
increasing penalties for sex crimes against children and
requiring electronic monitoring for child molesters who are
released from prison. By June 2006, 24 states had passed a
version of "Jessica's Law," often including mandatory mini-
mum sentences, electronic monitoring, and residence restric-
tions prohibiting sex offenders from living near schools,
parks, playgrounds, bus stops, or other places where children
congregate (Caputo, 2001; Martin, Pescosolido, Olafsdottir,
& McLeod, 2007). The San Francisco Chronicle reported
that 73% of voters supported Jessica's Law in California
(Caputo, 2001; Martin et al., 2007).
Though the public and lawmakers are supportive of sex
offender policies, scholars remain skeptical about the poten-
tial of these laws to protect children or prevent sex crimes
(Cochrane & Kennedy, 2010; Freeman-Longo, 1986;
Hindman, 1997). They suggest that community notification
laws are driven by emotional responses to sexual violence
rather than by empirical data and that they provide misguided
reassurance to citizens. The majority (80%) of mental health
professionals surveyed believed that registries would have
no impact on reducing the incidence of child sexual abuse,
and 70% thought community notification would foster a
false sense of security for parents (Malesky & Keim, 2001).
Another oft-cited concern is the potential for notification to
create unintended consequences that interfere with offender
reintegration by limiting opportunities for housing, employ-
ment, and social support (Levenson & Cotter, 2005).
Levenson and Cotter (2005) conducted a study on sex
offenders living in Florida and Kentucky. From one third to
half of the participants reported experiencing some type of
adverse effect from registration laws such as loss of employ-
ment, loss of housing, harassment, threats, or property dam-
age. Some participants reported that family members or
roommates (19%) suffered from some type of physical
assault.
Tewksbury and Lees (2007) surveyed registered sex
offenders living on campus. Their findings showed that only
one third of the offenders knew that their university retained
a sex offender registry that listed their name. Some negative
consequences of the campus registry included difficulties in
student housing, employment, maintaining social relation-
ships, harassment, and feelings of doubt and fear. The vast
majority (79%) of student sex offenders were denied employ-
ment. Half of the offenders were treated rudely by the public
and experienced losing a friend after they learned of their
status as a registered sex offender, and 15.8% lost a signifi-
cant other. Approximately 5.3% of offenders were assaulted
on and off campus. Student offenders (15.3%) reported
receiving harassing mail or phone calls. Just under a half
(47.4%) reported being evicted or being denied campus
housing. Only 26.3% admitted a decline in their academic
performance (Tewksbury & Lees, 2007).
O'Keefe and Reid-Nash (1987) argued that the more a
person pays attention to crime in the media, the more his or
her fear and concern increases, thereby making him or her
more attentive to the issue. A study conducted by Proctor and
colleagues (2002) on media and Megan's Law demonstrated
this phenomenon. Their findings showed a pattern in how the
media portrays Megan's Law and how it affected public per-
ceptions. The results indicated that exposure to all types of
media and the positive attention given to Megan's Law were
strongly connected to the participant's knowledge and accep-
tance of the law. Their results revealed that participants who
pay attention to crime and the media were more likely to
support criminal justice policies, and, in this particular study,
the participants were highly supportive of Megan's Law.
Proctor and Colleagues (2002) similarly found that
Massachusetts's community notification law increased the
level of specific knowledge concerning the issues of Megan's
Law but did not improve the general knowledge of the law.
Findings suggested that news media reinforces the public's
perception of Megan's Law and their positive belief that it
deters victimization. The media coverage also appeared to
sway the public to ignore the shortcomings of the law such as
its inability to reduce sex offenses and loss of support for
developing more effective ways to rehabilitate sex offenders
(Proctor & Colleagues, 2002; Schram & Milloy, 1995).

Attitude of Counselors
In recent years, there has been a limited amount of research
into the attitudes of mental health counselors toward sexual
offenders. Clinicians and researchers have noted the impor-
tant role of maladaptive attitudes and distorted thinking in
facilitating or justifying sexual offenses (Abel et al., 1984;
Marshall & Barbaree, 1990; Murphy & Stalgaitis, 1987;
Stermac & Segal, 1989). These attitudes and cognitive dis-
tortions function to avoid negative self-evaluation and social
disapproval, and facilitate the disengagement of the offend-
er's inhibitions regarding sexual offending (Stermac &
Segal, 1989; Ward et al., 1995). Inevitably, professional atti-
tudes toward sexual offenders, and other deviant popula-
tions, affect social service delivery and, in particular, the
nature and the quality of services provided (Ward et al.,
1995; Ward et al., 1996). According to Hogue (1993), assess-
ment of the professional's general attitude is necessary to
successful therapeutic intervention, as it is likely to influence
the client's response to change. It could also be argued that
professional attitudes toward sexual offenders significantly
affect other services for victims of abuse and those associ-
ated with them, because such attitudes can become part of
the framework of expert knowledge (Ward et al., 1995; Ward
et al., 1996).
The possibility that abuse supportive attitudes may be cul-
turally reinforced is an additional reason for investigating
counselor attitudes toward sexual offenders. Mental health
counselors are also subject to social stereotypes and inap-
propriate cultural messages about sex and violence (Ward
et al., 1995; Ward et al., 1996). Feminist theories view abuse
as a pseudosexual act that is primarily motivated by male
sociopolitical dominance (Burt, 1980; Donat & D'Emilio,
1992). During the 1970s, rape became a major issue for the
feminist movement, at least in part, because this form of vio-
lence toward women was seen as a means of enforcing pre-
cisely the gender roles that women were attempting to change
(Ward et al., 1995; Ward et al., 1996). Not only rape but also
the fear of rape serves as a mechanism of social control
(Brownmiller, 1975; Riger & Gordon, 1981). This view has
had a significant impact not only on etiological theories by
challenging the uncontrollable sex urge notion but also on
the way in which sexual assault has been defined, the way in
which rape victims are perceived and treated, and finally in
identifying aspects of the culture that are rape-supportive
(Ward et al., 1995; Ward et al., 1996). For example, Burt's
(1980) feminist theory of rape described how culturally
derived attitudes might facilitate sexual aggression. Burt
suggested that sex role, stereotypical beliefs, adversarial sex-
ual beliefs, and acceptance of interpersonal violence were
critical factors in mediating the link between culture and
sexual aggression.
Research interest into professional attitudes and beliefs
toward sex offenders, while developing in recent years,
remains limited. Stermac and Segal's (1989) study
into cognitive factors surrounding adult sexual contact with
children generated considerable debate when it compared
sex offender and professional cognitions in this area (Murphy,
1991; Ward et al, 1996). The study, while largely focusing on
sexual offender cognitions, also suggested that some clini-
cians (social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and
nurses) may view adult sexual contact with children to be of
partial benefit to the child. Murphy (1991) argued that if this
finding is replicated, it raises serious concerns about the ade-
quacy of education in the sexual abuse area. Hanson and
Slater (1993) in their study of professional reactions to child
molesters' behaviors pointed to the need for professionals to
be aware of offenders' strategies for externalizing blame and
generating sympathy. According to Ward et al. (1996), the
failure to do so may result in inadvertent collusion with
offenders' cognitive distortions and ineffective therapy.
Other studies examining professional attitudes regarding
child sexual abuse have generally considered comparisons
between professional groups within the practice field
(Murphy, 1991; Ward et al., 1996). Saunders (1988) com-
pared attitudes toward child sexual abuse among social
workers and professionals within the judicial system.
Statistically significant differences were found across the
groups. Social workers, the police, and district attorneys
were found to be strong advocates for victims, while public
defenders showed themselves to be strong advocates for
alleged offenders, and judges held more neutral attitudes
than any other group. Saunders concluded that conflict
remains between professionals on the most appropriate way
to deal with sexual abuse cases.
In a similar study, Trute et al. (1992) found that there were
significant differences in the attitudes of police in compari-
son with child welfare workers and community mental health
personnel. Police officers did not think that sexual abuse was
as widespread or affected victims as seriously, and viewed
sexual offenders as a more deviant group than did the child
welfare personnel. The police officers also viewed treatment
as more ineffective in curtailing child sexual abuse than
other groups. Interestingly, these differences were moderated
by the gender of the various professional groups. Women
tended to view sexual abuse as more pervasive, treatment as
more effective, and sexual offenders as a heterogeneous
group coming from all spheres of society (Trute et al., 1992).
These findings raised the interesting question of whether
gender is active in shaping professional belief systems, or
whether the professional role over time shapes perceptions
and beliefs of the workers involved (Ward et al., 1995; Ward
et al., 1996).
Polson and McCullom (1995) conducted a qualitative
study with several counselors specializing in the treatment of
sexual offenders. All the counselors interviewed worked
with sex offenders and victims of sexual abuse. Four general
themes describing counselor attitudes and behavior emerged
from the interviews: developing a positive view of perpetra-
tors, managing dysfunctional client behaviors and beliefs,
6 SAGE Open
controlling personal reactivity, and limitations of counseling.
In developing a positive view, counselors described con-
structing cognitive frames that view the sex offender as vul-
nerable, impaired, or human. It was also helpful to view the
offenders as victims, realize that their families still loved
them, defend their right to treatment, and view them as indi-
viduals with problems (Polson & McCullom, 1995).
Carone and LaFleur (2000) conducted an experimental
analogue study with 236 counselors-in-training who were
enrolled in one of eight counselor education master's degree
programs located in two Mid-Atlantic States. The student
counselors were asked to respond to demographic questions
and were administered the Counselor Response Form (CRF)
to determine the counselors' judgment of adolescent sexual
offender clients. The counselors were also given one of three
case histories presenting different client personal abuse his-
tories and instructed to respond to the CRF after reading the
case history. For each case history, the sexual offender per-
formed vaginal intercourse with a 10-year-old girl on two
occasions (Carone & LaFleur, 2000).
The results of this study revealed that counseling students
had a greater desire to work with a sexually abused adolescent
sexual offender than with an adolescent sexual offender who
was not abused. The results might be attributed to the idea
that sexually abused offenders have learned offending behav-
iors. The counseling students may have perceived the sexu-
ally abused offender as a victim of abuse that caused him or
her to learn the sexually offending behavior. Non-abused
offenders may be less desirable to work with because a poten-
tial rationale for their behavior cannot be determined. In addi-
tion, non-abused offenders may be perceived by counselors as
victims of medical or biological problems who may be per-
ceived by counseling professionals who could provide more
medically based types of treatment (Carone & LaFleur, 2000).
According to Borgers, Thomas, and Van Loon (1980),
counselor judgments affect the counseling relationship, and
the counselor's desire to work with certain clients is a judg-
ment that cannot be overlooked. As the need for juvenile
offender counselors grows with the increasing rate of reported
sexual offenses (Steen & Monnette, 1989), counselors will
need to explore their judgments about working with offender
clients to make informed decisions about their clients (Carone
& LaFleur, 2000; Nelson, 2007; Sanghara & Wilson, 2006).
Because counseling students desired to see the sexually
or physically abused adolescent sexual offenders more than
they desired to see the non-abused offenders, the develop-
ment of counseling relationships between counselors and
non-abused offenders may be affected (Graham, 1980;
Steen & Monnette, 1989). Graham (1980) found that reports
of counselor desire to see a client affect the counselor's
prognosis of client treatment and the counselor's predicted
length of time the client will need counseling. Consequently,
counselors should consider how the characteristics of non-
abused adolescent sexual offenders affect the counseling
relationship.
Nelson et al. (2002) studied 437 counselors who com-
pleted survey packets containing the Attitudes toward Sex
Offenders Scale (ATS) and personal background questions.
The findings of the study indicated that counselors tend to
have slightly positive attitudes toward sexual offenders and,
in addition, that experience, preparation from training, and
victim status are related to positive attitudes toward sexual
offenders. No relationship was found between counselor atti-
tudes and sex, employment, parental status, or education.
One reason for the positive attitude of counselors, as con-
trasted with the negative attitude that prevails among the
general public, may be related to the professional field.
Counselors typically are screened before entering into coun-
selor education programs. They are then trained throughout
their degree programs to be nonjudgmental, respectful, and
to believe in client change. In counseling education pro-
grams, the majority of beginning counselors have been
exposed to and trained in Rogers's person-centered counsel-
ing approach, which requires unconditional positive regard
for clients. Thus, it would be expected that counselors would
be less judgmental than the general public (Nelson, 2007;
Nelson et al., 2002).
According to Scaletta (1995), another explanation is that
the counseling field is growing and counselors are being
placed in a wide range of professional settings. Therefore,
counselors may be open to providing services to chronic or
difficult clients such as sexual offenders. They may be confi-
dent that sexual offenders will receive medical or punitive
interventions as needed.
Balow and Conley (2008) conducted a study with 307
probation, parole, and community correction workers. The
study participants were administered the CATSO. The find-
ings in this study yielded a representative portrayal of per-
ceptions across diverse concepts relative to sex offenders.
While respondents perceived that the sex offender popula-
tion is dangerous, they clearly agreed that offenders are ame-
nable to rehabilitation. They did not differentiate between the
severities of a sex crime based on whether the perpetrator
knew the victim and perceived that emotional control was
not substantially different than physical control. With regard
to offenders wearing tracking devices, most agreed that they
should, but opinions on this item were not particularly strong.
It is likely that the real world logistics of this affected opin-
ions. They disagree with the idea that offenders should never
get out of prison, indicating a mature acceptance of the fact
that most sex offenders will be released at some point and
will fall under their community-level supervision (Balow &
Conley, 2008).
This study attempted to answer the following research
questions:
Research Question 1: Is there a relationship between
attitudes of counseling professionals/paraprofessionals
toward adolescent sexual offenders and counseling
professionals/paraprofessionals' length of experience?

Research Question 2: Is there a relationship between
attitudes of counseling professionals/paraprofessionals
toward adolescent sexual offenders and counseling
professionals/paraprofessionals' amount of training?
Research Question 3: Is there a difference in attitudes of
counseling professionals/paraprofessionals toward
adolescent sexual offenders and counseling profes-
sionals/paraprofessionals' gender (male, female)?
Method
Participants
The target population for this research was from a selection
of counseling professionals/paraprofessionals employed at
a residential treatment program for adolescents in
Michigan. The only criterion the study participants had to
meet was that they had to be employed in a residential
treatment program for adolescents. The residential treat-
ment program employs 400 counseling professionals/para-
professionals. Of the 400 counseling professionals/
paraprofessionals, 150 employees responded to the recruit-
ment flyer and 133 attended the study. One hundred per-
cent of the participants who participated in the study
completed the self-administered CATSO questionnaire and
demographic form. The response rate of usable question-
naires was 100% (N = 133). A total of 133 participants
were included in the analysis. For this study, 32.3%
(n = 43) of the participants were female and 67.7% (n = 90)
were male. Participants reported their current position to
be treatment leaders (n = 19, 14.3%), followed by thera-
pists (n = 13, 9.8%), youth care workers (n = 58, 43.6%),
shift coordinators (n = 23, 17.3%), behavior management
personnel (security; n = 13, 9.8%), and family workers
(n = 7, 5.3%). The number of years the participants were
employed in their current position ranged from 0 to 18
(M = 4.27, SD = 4.15). Years of experience working directly
with adolescent sexual offenders ranged from 0 to 18 years
(M = 2.48 years, SD = 3.48). The number of months the
participants received sexual offender training ranged from
0 to 60 (M = 3.44, SD = 9.48).
Instruments (Measures)
The 18-item CATSO was used to collect data from the par-
ticipants. The 18 questions measure four subconstructs
including Social Isolation, Capacity to Change, Severity/
Dangerousness, and Deviancy. All questions are scaled using
a 6-point Likert scale. Respondents selected one of six
responses: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = probably
disagree, 4 = probably agree, 5 = agree, and 6 = strongly
agree. Higher scores on the survey reflect more negative
attitudes.
Instrumentation
The CATSO was construct-validated using exploratory and
confirmatory factor analysis with a population of 347 under-
graduate students enrolled in several Introduction to
Psychology classes at a major southern university (Balow &
Conley, 2008; Church, Wakeman, Miller, Clements, & Sun,
2008). Specifically, using exploratory factor analysis, four fac-
tors converged from 18 items with eigenvalues greater than
1.0. These factors include Social Isolation, Capacity to
Change,Severity/Dangerousness,andDeviancy.Confirmatory
factor analysis was used to test it and the 18-item instrument
was superior to the 30-item, original instrument. Results sug-
gest that the 18-item, four construct model was superior,
p < .05. Cronbach's alpha was also used to determine internal
consistency of the constructs. Results from the analysis indi-
catedsufficient reliabilitywheretotal CATSO = .74.Reliability
coefficients greater than .70 suggest internal consistency
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2008).
Data Analysis
The data was analyzed using two statistical techniques, the
Pearson product-moment correlation and analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA). Mean scores were calculated to create vari-
ables to represent the four CATSO factors, Social Isolation,
Capacity to Change, Severity/Dangerousness, and Deviancy.
The mean scores were generated based on the factors and
their corresponding items illustrated in Table 3. Once the val-
ues were generated for the four factor variables, descriptive
statistics were run to determine whether there were differ-
ences in measures of experience, training, and gender. Means
were then generated with experience, training, and gender
representing the independent variables, and the four factor
variables of the CATSO representing the dependent vari-
ables. The Pearson product-moment correlation was used to
determine the extent to which the demographic variables,
length of experience, and amount of training affected the par-
ticipants' attitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders. A
one-way ANOVA test was conducted to determine whether
females and males differed in their attitudes toward adoles-
cent sexual offenders.
Results
A total of 133 participants were included in the analysis. As
shown in Table 1, 32.3% (n = 43) of the participants were
female and 67.7% (n = 90) were male. Participants reported
their current position to be treatment leaders (n = 19, 14.3%),
followed by therapists (n = 13, 9.8%), youth care workers
(n = 58, 43.6%), shift coordinators (n = 23, 17.3%), behavior
management personal (security) (n = 13, 9.8%), and family
workers (n = 7, 5.3%).

Table 2 presents outcome findings related to participants,
years of experience working with adolescent sexual offend-
ers, and months of sexual offender training. The years of
experience working directly with adolescent sexual offend-
ers ranged from 0 to 18 (M = 2.48, SD = 3.48). The number
of months participants received sexual offender training
ranged from zero to 60 (M = 3.44, SD = 9.48).
As shown in Table 3, the attitude scores for participants
on the CATSO ranged from 1 to 6 (M = 2.81, SD = .564). On
the Social Isolation factor, participants obtained a mean
score of 2.93 (SD = .876), with a range of scores between 1
and 4. On the Capacity to Change factor, participants
obtained a mean score of 3.02 (SD = 1.07), with a range of
scores between 1 and 4. On the Severity/Dangerousness fac-
tor, participants obtained a mean score of 3.00 (SD = .557),
with a range of scores between 2 and 3. On the Deviancy
factor, participants obtained a mean score of 2.95 (SD =
.911), with a range of scores between 1 and 5.
Understanding the Relationship Between
Years of Experience and Months of Training
on Counseling Professionals/Paraprofessional
Attitudes Toward Adolescent Sexual Offenders
The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to understand
the strength of the relationship between demographic vari-
ables of participants and their attitudes toward adolescent
sexual offenders. Complete details of the Pearson correlations
for the relationship between years of experience and months
of training and outcome variables can be seen in Table 4.
Years of experience.Results showed no significant correla-
tion between years of experience and the measures of Social
Isolation (r = .019, p = .83), Capacity to Change (r = .103,
p = .24), and Severity/Dangerousness (r = -.145, p = .09). A
significant relationship between years of experience and
Deviancy (r = -.189, p = .03) was found.
Months of training. The results showed no significant correla-
tion between months of training and measures of Social Iso-
lation (r = .062, p = .47), Capacity to Change (r = .103, p =
.23), Severity/Dangerousness (r = .037, p = .66), and Devi-
ancy (r = .005, p = .95).
The Impact of Gender on Attitudes Toward
Adolescent Sexual Offenders
A one-way ANOVA was conducted to understand the differ-
ences between female and male participants'attitudes toward
adolescent sexual offenders. Table 6 details the results.
Results of the study indicate that the scores on the Social
Isolation Scale were slightly different across groups, F(2,
131) = 1.02, p = .31. The results indicate that females' (M =
3.04, SD = .928) scores were slightly different than those of
males (M = 2.88, SD = .850).
Regarding Capacity to Change, results showed a slight
difference across groups, F(2, 131) = .939, p = .33. The

results indicate that scores on the Capacity to Change factor
for females (M = 2.89, SD = 1.19) were slightly different
than those for males (M = 3.08, SD = 1.02).
For the Severity/Dangerousness factor, results showed a
slight difference across groups, F(2, 131) = 3.12, p =. 07. The
results indicate that scores on the Severity/Dangerousness
factor for females (M = 2.87, SD = .518) were slightly differ-
ent than those for males (M = 3.06, SD = .568).
Scores on the Deviancy factor showed no difference
across groups, F(2, 131) = .022, p = .88. Results for females
indicated M = 2.97 and SD = .874, and for males, M = 2.95
and SD = .934.
Discussion
Overall, no significant correlations between the examined
variables were found. The results of the analysis indicated
that there were no statistically significant correlations
between length of experience working with adolescent sex-
ual offenders, months of training, and gender with overall
attitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders. However, a
significant relationship was found between the length of
experience and the Deviancy factor on the CATSO survey.
No significant differences in attitudes between females and
males toward adolescent sexual offenders were found based
on the mean scores.
Effects of Experience, Training, and Gender
Experience.No significant correlation was found between
length of experience working with adolescent sexual offend-
ers and participant attitudes. The findings of this study are
not consistent with previous studies that have found years of
experience working with sexual offenders as a contributory
factor in the development of attitudes (Carone & LaFleur,
2000; Nelson, 2007; Sanghara & Wilson, 2006). Nelson
et al. (2002) found a significant positive relationship between
attitudes toward sex offenders and experience counseling sex
offenders using a sample of professional counselors in a psy-
chiatric setting.
Sanghara and Wilson (2006) found that experienced cor-
rectional professionals compared with inexperienced correc-
tional professionals endorsed fewer stereotypes regarding
sexual offenders. The experienced group obtained signifi-
cantly higher scores on the ATS than the inexperienced
group, indicating that they held more positive attitudes
toward child sexual offenders (Brown, 1999; Hogue, 1993;
Nelson et al., 2002; Valliant et al., 1994; Weekes et al., 1995).
There are no current studies known to the researcher, exam-
ining the relationship between counselors' experiences and
attitudes toward sexual offenders.
Regardless of the counseling professionals'/paraprofes-
sionals' length of experience in this study, their attitudes
toward adolescent sexual offenders were positive as indi-
cated by a mean score of 2.48, with a range of scores
between 1 and 6. Positive attitudes toward sexual offenders
regardless of experience might be attributed to the fact that
participants were asked to provide their opinions about
adolescent rather than adult sexual offenders. Because ado-
lescents are developmentally different than adults regard-
ing their moral, social, and cognitive development (Billick
& Mack, 2005; Calley, 2007, 2009; Feelgood, Cortoni, &
Thompson, 2005; Letourneau & Borduin, 2008; Shi &
Nicol, 2007), adolescent sexual offenders might be viewed
more positively than adult sexual offenders despite the
length of experience in this study.
A positive relationship between experience and the
Deviancy factor on the CATSO was found. Deviancy refers
to atypical sexual behaviors generally defined in moral,
legal, or medical terms, such as rape, incest, pedophilia, pub-
lic masturbation, and so on (Church et al., 2008; Hogue,
2003). Perhaps, the more experience the counseling profes-
sionals/paraprofessionals had working with adolescent sex-
ual offenders the more they witnessed varied sexual
behaviors. It might be safe to conclude that counseling pro-
fessionals/paraprofessionals witness varied sexual behavior
patterns while working with adolescent sexual offenders.
This finding suggests that with experience, participants wit-
ness an array of sexual behaviors that might be defined as
deviant. For instance, Rasmussen, McAnulty, and Mangum
(2001) asserted that sexual offenders often act out sexually
(i.e., masturbate, engage in uninhibited sexual fantasies, etc.)
in an attempt to resist treatment. Sexual offenders also dis-
play sexually deviant behavior when they believe that treat-
ment will cause them to lose something, or their goals are not
consistent with those of their counselors. Sexual deviancy is
a common problem among convicted sexual offenders,
regardless to whether they are receiving inpatient or outpa-
tient treatment. Therefore, it is likely that sexual offenders
will engage in sexual deviant behavior while engaged in the
treatment process (Carich, Newbauer, & Stone, 2001;
Newbauer & Blanks, 2001).
The researcher expected that the length of experience
would have an effect on counseling professionals'/parapro-
fessionals' attitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders.

However, these findings provide no support for the expecta-
tion that the length of experience would have an effect on
counseling professionals'/paraprofessionals' attitudes, nega-
tive or positive. The findings also indicated a strong relation-
ship between experience and the deviancy factor. The
relationship between experience and deviancy should be
examined further to better understand the nature of the rela-
tionship in future studies.
Training.No significant correlation was found between the
amount of training and participant attitudes toward adoles-
cent sexual offenders. The number of months the participants
received sexual offender training ranged from 0 to 60 (M =
3.44). This finding is consistent with previous studies that
have found no significant relationship between training and
attitudes toward sex offenders. Nelson, Herlihy, and Oescher
(2002) examined 437 counselors and found that there was no
significant relationship between attitudes and the extent that
they had received training for counseling sexual offenders.
However, a significant positive relationship was found
between attitudes and preparedness from training. In other
words, counselors felt prepared as a result of receiving train-
ing. As a result, counselors held more positive attitudes
toward sexual offenders when they felt prepared from their
training. Herlihy et al. concluded that the lack of specific
sexual offender training available to counseling profession-
als/paraprofessionals that provide service to this population
may account for this finding. Typically, counselors receive
specialized training through their clinical experience.
Although there was no significant correlation between the
amount of training and counseling professionals'/parapro-
fessionals' attitudes, overall attitudes toward adolescent sex-
ual offenders were positive in this study. Positive attitudes
might have been attributed to other factors, such as familiar-
ity working with the adolescent offenders in general. In other
words, regular contact with adolescent offenders (sexual and
nonsexual) might allow participants to view adolescent sex-
ual offenders no differently (Levy & Howells, 1994). Thus,
basic training to work with adolescent offenders in general
might have contributed to the positive attitudes toward this
group. Frequent contact with adolescent sexual offenders
might have also contributed to why the counseling profes-
sionals'/paraprofessionals' attitudes were positive regardless
of the amount of sex offender training received.
Despite no significant correlations between counseling
professionals'/paraprofessionals'amount of training and atti-
tudes, there is some evidence to suggest that training affects
counselor attitudes toward sexual offenders. Hogue (1993)
found that after training, participants' scores on the (ATS)
increased. After training, there was an increased belief that
they had skills to work with sex offenders, stronger beliefs
that counseling would stop offending acts, and a decrease in
their perceived need for more information. The participants
also experienced a reduced concern about the reactions of
colleagues and an increased feeling of safety in their work.
Hogue's study underscores the need for increased training
for professionals who counsel sex offenders. Given these
results, it might be safe to conclude that training itself may
not influence attitudes, and thus, other variables (i.e., famil-
iarity with adolescent sexual offenders and basic training)
working with adolescent offenders should be considered.
There are no current studies known to the researcher examin-
ing the relationship between familiarity with adolescent sex-
ual offenders and basic training, with counselor attitudes
toward adolescent sexual offenders.
Gender. No relationship was found between gender and atti-
tudes toward adolescent sexual offenders. In addition, a
slight but insignificant difference in attitudes between
females and males were found on the four factors that com-
prise the CATSO. These findings are similar to previous
studies that have examined the relationship between gender
and counselor attitudes toward sex offenders. Nelson et al.
(2002) examined the relationship between gender and atti-
tudes toward sexual offenders and found no significant dif-
ferences in attitudes related to gender. Ferguson and Ireland
(2006) examined the attitudes of forensic staff and students
using the ATS and found a significant relationship between
gender and attitudes. Although no statistical difference in
attitudes between men and women were found, women atti-
tudes were more positive than men. Ferguson and Ireland
suggested that their findings regarding women's attitudes
toward adolescent sexual offenders being more positive than
men were consistent with the findings from Radley (2001).
Radley suggested that such gender differences might be
explained by women's tendency to be more empathic than
males.
For this study, there were no significant differences on
mean scores between females and males on each CATSO
factor. On the Social Isolation factor, males were slightly
more positive. On the Capacity to Change factor, males were
again slightly more positive. On the Severity/Dangerousness
factor, females were slightly more positive than males. On
the Deviancy factor, no significant difference was found
when comparing the means scores for this factor. The differ-
ences between females' and males' attitudes toward adoles-
cent sexual offenders are not statistically significant to make
adequate assumptions. Therefore, future research might
explore the relationship between gender of the adolescent
sexual offender (female/male) and the gender of the counsel-
ing professional/paraprofessional to further assess its role in
the development of attitudes.
Limitations
There are a number of limitations for this study. The study
did not include the kind of probability and stratification strat-
egies that are needed to ensure good external validity. That is
to say, while convenience sampling was an acceptable, cost-
effective method, it limited the sample to those participants
Jones 11
found in the chosen groups (i.e., counseling professionals/
paraprofessionals) employed or trained within an adolescent
treatment facility in or around Michigan. Thus, the study was
predicated on opinions from a restricted geographic area. A
drawback to the use of group administration was the possi-
bility that participants may not have treated the survey as
seriously when filling it out as part of a group than they
might have if they were permitted to fill it out unaccompa-
nied. Another potential drawback to group administration of
the survey instrument concerned the participant's right to
decline participation)--namely, participants may have felt
pressured to participate in the survey because of the observa-
tion that all others were participating despite the researcher's
efforts at emphasizing the understanding that participants
should not feel compelled to participate. As such, conformity
effect may have occurred because participation in the project
became the norm defined by the behavior of fellow partici-
pants. Consequently, the results of this study might have
been affected if participants did not truthfully answer the
questions.
In addition, because of the self-reported nature of the
measure, participants were vulnerable to social desirability
biases, which may have affected the ability on the part of the
researcher to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
Socially desirable feedback can be defined as the tendency
for participants to present a favorable image of themselves,
such as when participants "pretend" to conform to socially
acceptable values and norms, avoid criticism, or gain social
acceptance. Due to the fact that the CATSO included items
that could be deemed socially sensitive, socially desirable
responding is a potential limitation.
Unlike previous studies examining counselors' attitudes
toward sexual offenders, this study used only one survey
instrument to measure counselors' attitudes toward sexual
offenders rather than diverse assessment methods. Previous
studies have used diverse assessment methods to measure
counselors' attitudes toward sexual offenders. Carone and
LaFleur (2000) used case histories of sexual offenders and
then administered a counselor response form to measure
participant responses. Ferguson and Ireland (2006) used
vignettes depicting specific sexual offenses followed by an
attitude survey with staff working in a forensic setting and
students. Carone and LaFleur (2000) used multiple instru-
ments (i.e., opinions about mental illness scale, general
attribution questionnaire, and the level of familiarity ques-
tionnaire) to assess counselor attitudes. This use of diverse
methods to measure attitudes might have improved the
researchers' chance to obtain useful data for a critical analy-
sis and interpretation. The current study was limited to the
CATSO and participant demographic information, limiting
the conclusions that could be drawn, such as the role the
selected demographics (i.e., experience, training, and gen-
der) play in the development of attitudes toward adolescent
sexual offenders.
The correlational nature of this study was limiting--
That is, due to the correlational design of this study being
primarily descriptive in nature, causality could not be deter-
mined. Specifically, it is difficult to say that the various
professional demographic variables cause particular atti-
tudes toward adolescent sexual offenders; it is only allow-
able to say that certain attitudes co-vary with certain
variables. Future research could delve deeper into other
important correlates of other contexts in which these cor-
relations occur. The researcher suggests using a mixed
research approach (qualitative and quantitative) to further
explore counseling professionals'/paraprofessionals' atti-
tudes toward adolescent sexual offenders.
Future Studies
The results of this study suggest several areas for future
exploration. As noted, this study was the first to examine
the attitudes of counseling professionals/paraprofessionals
toward adolescent sexual offenders. Previous studies have
examined counselor attitudes toward adult sexual offend-
ers. Because adolescents are characteristically different
from adult sexual offenders, and given the complexity of
adolescent sexual aggression (Billick & Mack, 2005;
Calley, 2009; Feelgood et al., 2005; Letourneau & Borduin,
2008; Shi & Nicol, 2007), more future studies should focus
on examining counselor attitudes toward adolescent sexual
offenders to better understand counselors' attitudes toward
this population.
Although there was no significant correlations found
between length of experience, amount of training, and gen-
der with counseling professionals'/paraprofessionals' atti-
tudes toward adolescent sexual offenders, this study should
be replicated in other adolescent residential treatment pro-
grams using similar research methods, variables, and instru-
ment. Replication of the current study might produce results
different from it and, thus, provide a different perspective as
well as add to the body of literature regarding counselors'
attitudes and adolescent sexual offenders.
Future studies might also focus on other demographic
variables (i.e., education, amount of contact with adolescent
sexual offenders, familiarity with adolescent sexual offend-
ers, culture, etc.) to identify variables that might influence
counselor attitudes toward adolescent sexual offenders.
Although the aforementioned variables are different from the
variables examined in this study, examining other variables
might increase the chances of identifying the variables that
might affect counselors' attitudes toward adolescent sexual
offenders. Successfully identifying demographic variables
that might influence counselors' attitudes toward sexual
offender might provide implications for rapport building,
specifically with adolescent sexual offenders.
Although adolescent and adult sexual offenders are
viewed differently, there are many similarities to consider in
12 SAGE Open
treating both the populations. For example, one similarity is
that there must be a good rapport between the offender and
counselor for treatment to be effective (Carone & LaFleur,
2000; Ertl & McNamara, 1997; Schneider et al., 2006).
Future studies might compare counselor attitudes toward
adolescent and adult sexual offenders to determine the attitu-
dinal factors that appear to be common for both populations.
This, in turn, would have implications for treatment. In other
words, the results of future studies comparing the attitudes of
counselors toward adolescent and adult sexual offenders
might discover demographic variables significant to treating
adolescent or adult sexual offenders. For instance, demo-
graphic variables that are found significant to engage adoles-
cent sexual offenders in the treatment process might not be
significant variables when treating adult sexual offenders.
Per se, this might have implications for what counseling
demographic variables are more important treating adoles-
cent or adult sexual offenders.
As noted, this study was limited to one instrument, the
CATSO, to measure counseling professionals'/paraprofes-
sionals' attitudes. Future studies should use multiple assess-
ment methods to measure attitudes. Previous studies
examining attitudes of counselors toward sexual offenders
have used multiple assessment methods (i.e., case vignettes,
various assessment scales, etc.). Multiple assessment meth-
ods might produce a more useful and diverse range of data,
thereby allowing more opportunity for an in-depth analysis
and interpretation of findings.
The current study did not compare the attitudes among
and between the types of counseling professionals/parapro-
fessionals (i.e., therapists compared with family workers)
represented in this study. Future studies using a sample of
counseling professionals/paraprofessionals should compare
attitudes using similar demographic variables to identify
differences in attitudes. Identifying differences between
counseling professionals/paraprofessionals might provide a
better understanding of the relationship between certain
demographic variables and attitudes. Comparing counsel-
ing professionals/paraprofessionals attitudes might provide
implications for training and informing policy.
Conclusion
Attention to the attitudes of counselors toward sexual offend-
ers is an important topic in the sexual abuse field, and is an
area that is evolving. It is without question that prejudice
against sexual offenders is a destructive force in society
because it inhibits people from receiving the kind of care
they need (Hogue, 1993; Nelson, 2007; Sanghara & Wilson,
2006). Although Western culture has highlighted the preva-
lence of sexually abusive behaviors, people within the cul-
ture continue to differ in their attitudes toward sexual
offenders.
Despite the counseling professionals'/paraprofessionals'
limited experience and training with adolescent sexual
offenders in this study, their attitudes were positive. In addi-
tion, there were no significant differences in attitudes between
females and males toward adolescent sexual offenders.
Although these results are somewhat encouraging, there is
still a limited understanding as to what variables might have
influenced their attitudes. Therefore, research efforts must
increase to fully understand the variables that might influence
counselor attitudes toward sexual offenders. This, in turn,
would have implications for hiring practices, training for
counselors, and treatment for adolescent sexual offenders.
