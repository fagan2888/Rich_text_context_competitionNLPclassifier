Racial Differences in the Relationship Between
Hepatitis C Infection and Iron Stores

Black race and increased hepatic iron stores predict poor response to interferon treatment for
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We tested the hypothesis that these 2 observations
are linked by investigating whether HCV-infected African-Americans have increased iron
stores relative to uninfected persons. Using data from the third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III), we determined the risk of having increased iron
stores, defined as elevation of both serum ferritin and transferrin-iron saturation (TS), in
HCV-RNA­positive blacks (n  100) and nonblacks (n  126) relative to HCV-RNA­
negative blacks (n  4,002) and nonblacks (n  10,943). HCV-positive blacks were 5.4
times (95% CI, 1.2 to 24) more likely to have increased iron stores than HCV-positive
nonblacks. The proportion of HCV-positive blacks who had increased iron stores was 16.4%
among those with abnormal liver enzymes and 2.8% among those with normal liver en-
zymes, compared with only 0.6% among HCV-negative blacks. After adjustment for age,
alcohol intake, gender, menopausal status, education, body mass index, and poverty index,
HCV-positive blacks with abnormal liver enzymes had an elevated risk of having increased
iron stores (odds ratio, 17.8; 95% CI, 5.1 to 63). In contrast, among persons of other races,
there was a much smaller difference in the proportion of persons with increased iron stores
between HCV-positive persons with (3.4%) or without (1.4%) abnormal liver enzymes and
HCV-negative persons (0.9%). In conclusion, a greater proportion of blacks than persons of
other races respond to HCV infection with an increase in iron stores. This finding may partly
explain the reduced response of HCV-positive African-Americans to antiviral treatment.
(HEPATOLOGY 2003;37:795-801.)
Relative to whites, black patients with hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection are more resistant to an-
tiviral treatment with interferon, pegylated in-
terferon, or combination of interferon and ribavirin.1-6
Interracial differences in viral loads and the prevalence
of HCV genotype 1 infection only partly account for
the observed differences in response to antiviral treat-
ments.
Previous studies have suggested that patients with
chronic HCV commonly have elevated levels of serum
markers of iron stores (ferritin, transferrin-iron saturation
[TS], or iron).7-13 The presence of elevated body iron
stores and, in particular, elevated hepatic iron levels, is one
of the strongest predictors of resistance to interferon treat-
ment for HCV.14-22
We used data from the third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III) to determine
whether there are differences between HCV-infected blacks
and HCV-infected nonblacks with respect to the likelihood
of increased iron stores. We hypothesized that among per-
sonswithHCVinfection,agreaterpercentageofblacks than
nonblacks would have elevated iron stores, because such a
finding would be in agreement with the observed lower re-
sponse of blacks to antiviral treatment. Also, we asked
whether any difference in iron stores between HCV-infected
blacks and other races might be attributed to a response to
the HCV infection itself, rather than an underlying excess of
iron stores in blacks without HCV infection.

Patients and Methods
Survey Design and Collection of Data. NHANES
III was conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics during 1988 to 1994 to assess the health and
nutritional status of the United States population.23 It
included a sample of 33,994 persons of at least 2 months
of age from 89 randomly selected locations throughout
the United States. The NHANES sampling process is
designed such that the participants constitute a represen-
tative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized, United
States population. The survey collected data via house-
hold interviews, standardized physical examinations, and
laboratory investigations.
Study Sample. Of 33,994 NHANES III participants,
we excluded 13,483 persons under 16 years of age because
we assumed that iron status is influenced by different
factors in the pediatric population compared with the
adult population. We also excluded 3,373 persons who
were not tested for serum iron, TS, ferritin, albumin,
bilirubin, platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase, ala-
nine aminotransferase, or hepatitis C viral antibodies. Ad-
ditionally, we excluded 1,039 participants with missing
data regarding alcohol consumption, demographic char-
acteristics, or menstrual history. We wanted to evaluate
whether hepatitis C infection is associated with increased
iron stores even in the absence of advanced cirrhosis, be-
cause advanced cirrhosis secondary to any cause is associ-
ated with iron overload.24-26 No questions were asked in
NHANES III regarding the presence of cirrhosis or
chronic liver disease; therefore, we attempted to identify
participants at risk of having advanced cirrhosis based on
the presence of either a serum albumin less than 3.5 g/dL,
a platelet count less than 100,000/L,27,28 or a total se-
rum bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dL. We identified 928
participants who fulfilled at least 1 of these criteria, in-
cluding only 29 who were HCV-RNA positive. This
number of HCV-RNA­positive participants with evi-
dence of cirrhosis was too small to be analyzed separately;
therefore, all 928 participants with possible evidence of
cirrhosis were excluded, leaving 15,171 participants in
this analysis.
Measurement of Serum Markers of Iron Stores.
Details of the assay methods used in NHANES III for the
evaluation of serum ferritin, iron, and TS have been de-
scribed elsewhere,29,30 and will only be summarized here.
Serum iron and total iron binding capacity were measured
colorimetrically (Alpkem RFA analyzer; Clackamas, OR),
and 1% thiourea was added to complex copper and pre-
vent copper interference.30 Iron saturation was calculated
as the ratio of serum iron to total iron binding capacity.
Serum ferritin was measured with the BioRad Quantim-
mune IRMA kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
Participants who were scheduled for phlebotomy between
8 am and noon (n  7,434, or 49%) were instructed to
fast for 10 to 16 hours, and participants who were sched-
uled for phlebotomy after noon were instructed to fast for
6 hours.
Assessment of HCV Status. A second-generation en-
zyme immunoassay and a supplemental test (EIA 2.0 and
HCV MATRIX, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago,
IL) were used to test for anti-HCV antibodies. Samples
found to be anti-HCV positive were subsequently tested
for HCV-RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction.31,32 Samples found to be negative by reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were extracted a
second time by the same procedure, with an additional
incubation at 50°C for 45 minutes with 25 U of reverse
transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN)
and 10 U of ribonuclease inhibitor (Boehringer Mann-
heim). For this study, only participants with positive
HCV-RNA were considered to be chronically infected
with HCV. All subjects with negative anti-HCV antibody
tests were assumed to be HCV-RNA negative.
Assessment of Potential Confounding Variables.
Race, gender, menopausal status, age, education, poverty
index, body mass index, and alcohol consumption may be
associated with both HCV infection32 and the levels of
serum markers of iron stores.33,34 These variables, which
were obtained in NHANES III by subject interviews and
examinations, were, therefore, selected a priori for inclu-
sion in regression models as potential confounders. Race
was categorized in 3 groups: non-Hispanic black, non-
Hispanic white, and other. There were too few Asians/
Pacific Islanders/American Indians (n  207, of whom
only 4 were HCV positive) to allow separate categoriza-
tion. Age was modeled as a continuous variable. Educa-
tional attainment was classified according to whether or
not a participant had graduated from high school. The
poverty income ratio, a measure of poverty that is inde-
pendent of calendar year, was computed as the ratio of
self-reported family income to the poverty threshold ac-
cording to each calendar year.23 Participants with a pov-
erty income ratio less than 1.0 were considered to be
below the poverty level. Body mass index was computed
as the ratio of the measured weight in kg to the square of
the measured height in meters and was modeled as a con-
tinuous variable. Participants of NHANES III were asked
the average number of days during which alcohol was
consumed and the average number of drinks consumed
on each of those days during the past 12 months. We used
these data to calculate the average number of alcoholic
drinks per day during the preceding year.

Statistical Analysis. The primary outcome of this
study was the presence of increased iron stores, defined as
elevation of both serum TS (45%) and serum ferritin
(300 ng/mL in men or 200 ng/mL in women), which
is a more specific indicator of increased iron stores than
either test alone.35,36 The aims of our analyses were, first,
to investigate whether HCV-infected blacks were more
likely than HCV-infected nonblacks to have increased
iron stores. This was determined by limiting our analysis
to HCV-infected persons and using a multivariate logistic
regression model to compare blacks and nonblacks with
respect to the risk of having elevated iron stores, after
adjusting for the potential confounders described above.
The second aim of our analyses was to investigate
whether there were differences between blacks and other
racial groups in regard to the association between HCV
infection and increased iron stores. We determined this
by using a multivariate logistic regression model that
compared HCV-negative to HCV-positive persons with
respect to the odds of having increased iron stores and
included an interaction term between race and HCV sta-
tus. The HCV-positive persons with and without abnor-
mal levels of serum liver enzymes were analyzed separately
because previous studies suggested that serum markers of
iron stores are higher among those with abnormal liver
enzyme levels.13 Liver enzyme levels were considered ab-
normal if either serum aspartate or alanine aminotrans-
ferases were 40 U/L.
Levels of serum ferritin and TS may be affected not
only by iron stores, but also by the presence of acute
inflammation.37 To exclude the possibility that any ob-
served differences in levels of serum ferritin or TS were
attributable to differences in the prevalence of inflamma-
tory conditions, we performed additional analyses adjust-
ing for the level of C-reactive protein, an acute phase
reactant believed to reflect inflammation levels. C-reac-
tive protein levels were categorized as "undetectable" (de-
fined in NHANES III as a level 0.21 mg/dL), 0.21 to
0.4 mg/dL (corresponding to the seventy-fifth centile),
0.4 to 0.88 mg/dL (corresponding to the ninetieth
centile), and 0.88 mg/dL.
To increase the efficiency of the sampling process,
NHANES III employed a complex, multistage sampling
design whereby potential participants were identified
from 89 locations in the United States. This induces a
correlation structure among the observations, which can-
not be treated as a simple random sample. In addition,
because NHANES III involved oversampling of certain
age and racial groups, sample weights are provided to
reflect this and also to attempt to adjust for nonresponse
bias (because of people refusing to participate) and non-
coverage bias (because of people who do not live in house-
holds and, therefore, could not participate). We used
STATA software version 7.0 (College Station, TX) in our
analyses to account for both the sampling and the weight-
ing processes.
Results
The prevalence of HCV-RNA positivity in this study
was 1.5% (226 of 15,571), including 100 blacks and 126
persons of other races (Table 1). Compared with other
HCV-positive persons, HCV-positive blacks were
younger and leaner but otherwise were similar in regard to
gender distribution, alcohol consumption, educational
attainment, income level, and the prevalence of abnormal
levels of liver enzymes or undetectable levels of C-reactive
protein. Compared with black or nonblack HCV-nega-
tive participants, those who were HCV positive were
younger, leaner, had lower educational attainment and
income, consumed more alcohol, and were more likely to
be male and to have abnormal liver enzyme levels and
undetectable levels of C-reactive protein (Table 1).
The prevalence of elevations in serum ferritin, TS, or
both was higher in HCV-infected blacks than HCV-in-
fected persons of other races (Table 2). HCV-infected
blacks were 5.4 times more likely (95% CI, 1.2 to 24)
than HCV-infected nonblacks to have elevations in both
serum ferritin and TS (Table 2).
HCV infection was associated with much greater ele-
vations in serum markers of iron stores in blacks com-
pared with other racial groups (Fig. 1). The levels of
serum ferritin, TS, and iron, were 121 ng/mL (95% CI,
56 to 186), 7.5% (95% CI, 2.5 to 12.4), and 34.4 g/dL
(95% CI, 19.6 to 49.2), respectively, higher in HCV-
positive blacks with abnormal liver enzyme levels com-
pared with HCV-negative blacks after adjustment for
gender, menopausal status, age, education, poverty index,
body mass index, and alcohol consumption. HCV-posi-
tive blacks with normal liver enzyme levels also had eleva-
tions in serum ferritin, TS, and iron, but the magnitude of
these elevations was approximately half of that observed
in HCV-positive blacks with abnormal liver enzymes.
The proportion of HCV-positive blacks who had elevated
serum ferritin and TS was 16.4% among those with ab-
normal liver enzyme levels and 2.8% among those with
normal liver enzyme levels compared with only 0.6%
among HCV-negative blacks (Table 3 and Fig. 1). Com-
pared with HCV-negative blacks, the odds ratio of having
elevations in both serum ferritin and TS was 17.8 (95%
CI, 5.1 to 63) in blacks with abnormal liver enzyme levels
and 3.3 (95% CI, 0.3 to 36) in blacks whose enzyme levels
were normal after adjustment for age, alcohol intake, gen-
der, menopausal status, education, body mass index, and
poverty index.

In contrast, among nonblack participants, there was no
difference in mean serum TS and iron between HCV-
negative and HCV-positive participants (with or without
abnormal liver enzymes). Mean serum ferritin level was
100 ng/mL (95% CI, 20 to 179) higher in nonblack
HCV-positive participants with abnormal liver enzymes,
but not in those with normal liver enzymes, compared
with HCV-negative participants. Compared with the dif-
ferences that we observed in blacks, among nonblacks
there was a much smaller difference in the proportion of
persons with increased iron stores between HCV-positive
persons with (3.4%) or without (1.4%) abnormal liver
enzymes and HCV-negative persons (0.9%) (Table 3 and
Fig. 1). Additionally adjusting for C-reactive protein lev-
els had negligible effect on the results presented above
(data not shown).
Discussion
Black patients with hepatitis C have lower likelihood of
response to antiviral treatment than white patients even
when differences in HCV genotype distribution and
HCV viral loads between blacks and whites are taken into
consideration.1-6 We investigated whether there are dif-
ferences between HCV-infected blacks and whites in re-
gard to the presence of elevated iron stores, which is a
predictor of poor response to interferon treatment.14-21
Our results suggest that the prevalence of increased
iron stores, as defined by elevations in both serum ferritin
and TS, is higher in HCV-infected blacks (10.7%) than
in HCV-infected whites (2.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.4;
95% CI, 1.2 to 24). Furthermore, this difference can be
explained by our observation that HCV infection is asso-
ciated with much greater increases in iron stores in blacks
compared with nonblacks.
The extent to which these differences in iron stores can
explain the previously described racial differences in re-
sponse to antiviral treatment depends on the extent to
which the association between elevated iron stores and
improved response to interferon treatment is believed to
be causative. Increased body or hepatic iron stores may be
surrogate markers for other factors associated with a low
likelihood of response, such as advanced fibrosis, HCV
genotype 1, high viral load, male gender, and long dura-

tion of HCV infection. On the other hand, the fact that
iron depletion by phlebotomy in patients with HCV re-
duces serum aminotransferase levels38-43 and, in combina-
tion with interferon, may have improved antiviral efficacy
compared with interferon alone39,41,43 suggests that in-
creased iron stores may be the cause of the reduced re-
sponse to interferon.
Although the presence of increased iron stores is a rec-
ognized predictor of poor response to interferon mono-
therapy,15-22 the association between increased iron stores
and response to combination treatment with interferon
and ribavirin or pegylated interferon and ribavirin has not
been investigated adequately. Only one such study is cur-
rently available44 in which 40 patients were treated with
interferon and ribavirin, of whom 18 had sustained viro-
logic response. There was no difference in hepatic iron
concentration between responders and nonresponders;
however, given the small number of subjects involved, it is
difficult to exclude a type 2 error. Of note, in this study,
the mean serum ferritin concentration was higher in non-
responders (244 ng/mL) than in responders (189 ng/mL),
although, again, this difference was not statistically signif-
icant. Therefore, larger, prospective studies are required
to evaluate whether iron stores are associated with re-
sponse to combination treatment, and whether such an
association is modified by race.
Our finding that HCV-positive blacks were 5.4 times
more likely to have increased iron stores than HCV-pos-
itive nonblacks may have implications beyond potentially
explaining racial differences in treatment response rates.
Hepatic iron increases the production of reactive oxygen
species, which may lead to lipid peroxidation, steatosis,
depletion of glutathione stores, and accelerated liver dam-
age.45,46 Furthermore, the presence of increased iron

stores may be a predictor of developing hepatocellular
carcinoma in patients with chronic HCV infection.47
Thus, the presence of increased iron stores may predispose
blacks to worse clinical outcomes related to HCV infec-
tion compared with whites. Indeed, the incidence of hep-
atocellular carcinoma in the United States is 2 to 3 times
greater in blacks than in white persons.48 On the other
hand, retrospective studies have suggested that the rate of
histologic progression in chronic HCV infection is either
similar28 or lower49 in blacks than in whites. However,
these studies are subject to both selection bias and to great
inaccuracies in the calculation of histological progression,
which was based on duration of infection estimated from
the earliest potential exposure to the virus.
We observed that HCV infection was associated with
much greater elevations in serum markers of iron stores in
patients with abnormal liver enzymes compared with pa-
tients with normal liver enzymes. One potential explana-
tion for this finding is that elevated liver enzymes are a
sign of ongoing hepatic necroinflammation, which may
lead to elevations in serum markers of iron stores through
release of iron-loaded ferritin from dying hepatocytes. Al-
ternatively, if hepatitis C infection has effects on gastro-
intestinal iron absorption or iron metabolism, then these
effects may be more pronounced in patients with active
disease as evidenced by elevated liver enzymes.
Our study is limited by the fact that the hepatic iron
concentration, which is a better predictor of response to
interferon than serum markers of iron stores, was not
available because liver biopsies were not performed in this
population-based study. Nonetheless, serum ferritin and
TS levels have been shown to have good correlation to
hepatic iron concentration levels.7,11,50 Future studies will
be required to determine if hepatic iron concentration
also is higher in blacks compared with whites with chronic
HCV infection. Also, future studies should investigate
whether the lower response of blacks than persons of other
races to antiviral treatment is restricted to persons with
evidence of elevated hepatic iron concentration or serum
markers of iron stores.
It is unlikely that the absence of data on hemochroma-
tosis gene (HFE) mutations has given rise to uncontrolled
confounding in our comparison between HCV-positive
and HCV-negative persons, because the prevalence of
HFE mutations is the same in HCV-positive and negative
persons.7 It is also unlikely that the presence of sickle cell
disease accounts for the elevation in iron stores that we
observed in black patients with HCV infection: sickle
cells were present in 4 out of 4,534 participants who had
microscopic examination of a peripheral blood film, in-
cluding 3 blacks, none of whom was HCV-RNA positive.
Finally, it is unlikely that the differences in iron markers
that we observed between HCV-positive blacks and
HCV-positive nonblacks, or between HCV-positive and
HCV-negative persons are related to differences in the
presence of acute inflammation, because adjustment for
C-reactive protein levels did not affect these observations.
In summary, we observed that HCV-infected blacks
are 5 times more likely to have elevated serum markers of
iron stores than HCV-infected nonblacks. This finding is,
in turn, the result of a particularly strong association be-
tween HCV infection and increased iron stores among
blacks. Future studies should investigate whether these
findings can partly explain the relatively low response of
blacks to antiviral treatment.
