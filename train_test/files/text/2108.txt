Abstract
Background: Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, particularly among minorities, and if
improperly managed can lead to medical complications and death. Healthcare providers play vital roles in
communicating standards of care, which include guidance on diabetes self-management. The background of the
client may play a role in the patient-provider communication process. The aim of this study was to determine the
association between medical advice and diabetes self care management behaviors for a nationally representative
sample of adults with diabetes. Moreover, we sought to establish whether or not race/ethnicity was a modifier for
reported medical advice received and diabetes self-management behaviors.
Methods: We analyzed data from 654 adults aged 21 years and over with diagnosed diabetes [130 Mexican-
Americans; 224 Black non-Hispanics; and, 300 White non-Hispanics] and an additional 161 with `undiagnosed
diabetes' [N = 815(171 MA, 281 BNH and 364 WNH)] who participated in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether medical
advice to engage in particular self-management behaviors (reduce fat or calories, increase physical activity or
exercise, and control or lose weight) predicted actually engaging in the particular behavior and whether the
impact of medical advice on engaging in the behavior differed by race/ethnicity. Additional analyses examined
whether these relationships were maintained when other factors potentially related to engaging in diabetes self
management such as participants' diabetes education, sociodemographics and physical characteristics were
controlled. Sample weights were used to account for the complex sample design.
Results: Although medical advice to the patient is considered a standard of care for diabetes, approximately one-
third of the sample reported not receiving dietary, weight management, or physical activity self-management
advice. Participants who reported being given medical advice for each specific diabetes self-management
behaviors were 4-8 times more likely to report performing the corresponding behaviors, independent of race.
These results supported the ecological model with certain caveats.
Conclusions: Providing standard medical advice appears to lead to diabetes self-management behaviors as
reported by adults across the United States. Moreover, it does not appear that race/ethnicity influenced reporting
performance of the standard diabetes self-management behavior. Longitudinal studies evaluating patient-provider
communication, medical advice and diabetes self-management behaviors are needed to clarify our findings.

Background
Diabetes leads to complications such as heart disease and
stroke, high blood pressure, blindness, kidney disease and
nervous system disease; the risk of death for persons with
diabetes is twice that of persons without diabetes [1].
Type 2 diabetes, the most common form (90-95% of all
cases), has increased in the general population [2] and
disproportionately among minorities (particularly African
Americans and Hispanics) [3]. Mexican Americans have
the highest rate of diabetes among Hispanics and are 1.7
times more likely to have diabetes as White non-Hispa-
nics [1] and their age-adjusted diabetes death rate was
1.5 greater than White non-Hispanics [4]. African Ameri-
cans are 2.1 times more likely to be diagnosed with dia-
betes than White non-Hispanics [1] and their age-
adjusted death rate from diabetes was nearly twice that of
White non-Hispanics (45.1 versus 23.3 per 100,000) [4].
Due to the many health consequences of diabetes and
the nature of the disease, diabetes care is vital to quality
of life and survival. Diabetes is a disease that can be man-
aged by the individual with appropriate guidance. Yet
fewer than 60% of all adults age 40 and over with diag-
nosed diabetes have their blood glucose, cholesterol, or
blood pressure within the recommended levels for ade-
quate control [5]. According to the American Diabetes
Association's (ADA) Standards of Medical Care [6] an
operational definition of high quality health care for per-
sons with diabetes would include guidance on risk factor
control for all of the following: 1) dietary intake and
weight management; 2) glycemic and lipid control; and
3) foot and eye care.
The ecological model (Figure 1) was used in this study
as a framework for the concepts applied to DSM out-
comes [7]. Medical advice, diabetes education, and the
patient's race and cultural environment influence their
behaviors and consequently their health outcomes. Dia-
betes care is largely the responsibility of the individual;
however, healthcare professionals can play vital roles in
the patient's skill development through effective patient-
provider communication with respect to collaborative
goal setting and individual assessment [8,9].
Methods
Data collection
All data used for this study were openly, publically avail-
able [10]. Raw data were extracted from datasets from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
2007-2008 (NHANES 2007-2008) [10]. This survey con-
tained data for 10,149 individuals of all ages. Data were
collected between January 2007 and December 2008
using a complex, multistage, probability sample design.
The data from NHANES consist of 2-year representative
samples of the non-institutionalized, civilian U.S.
population. All participants read, understand and sign
informed consent forms based on the approved study
protocol from the National Center for Health Statistics
Research Ethics Review Board [10]. The study was lim-
ited to male and female adults ages  21 years who pro-
vided self-report diagnosis of diabetes or who had
hemoglobin A1c
(A1C)  6.5, underwent an examination
at the Mobile Examination Center (MEC), and belonged
to one of the following race/ethnicity classifications:
Black non-Hispanics (BNH), Mexican American (MA),
and White non-Hispanics (WNH). Of the total sample
size for the 2007-2008 participants, there were 2,064 MA,
1,147 other Hispanics, 2,141 BNH, 3969 WNH and 441
persons classified as "other". From the combined sample,
there were 777 persons (7.7%) of the 9372 valid cases
who responded to the screening question for diabetes
diagnosis. The categories for "other Hispanics" and
"other races" were 10.8% and 2.7%, respectively and did
not have a sufficient sample sizes for comparative ana-
lyses. Approximately 2% (n = 14) of the subjects were
minors (< 18 years). The final sample size of participants
who met the inclusion criteria for the main study ques-
tion was [N = 654 (130 MA, 224 BNH and 300 WNH)].
There were n = 161 classified as `undiagnosed diabetes'.
The final sample size, including individuals with `undiag-
nosed diabetes', was [N = 815(171 MA, 281 BNH and
364 WNH)].
Definitions
Diagnosed diabetes
Several questions were considered for the construction
of the variable `diagnosed diabetes': 1) "The next ques-
tions are about specific medical conditions. Other than
during preganncy, have you ever been told by a doctor
or health professional that you had diabetes or sugar
diabetes?"; 2) "How old were you when a doctor or
other health professional first told you that you had dia-
betes or sugar diabetes?"; and 3) "When was your dia-
betes diagnosed?"
Each question was by self-report and subject to recall-
bias. Since there were missing values for questions 2
and 3, construction of the variable, `diagnosed diabetes'
was based on question 1.
Undiagnosed diabetes
Both fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1C
(A1C) were initially considered for construction of the
`undiagnosed diabetes' variable. The latter was chosen,
since there were approximately twice as many missing
values for FBG as compared to A1C. The inclusion cri-
teria were the same as for `diagnosed diabetes' with the
exception that both conditions were met: 1) `no self-
report of being diagnosed with diabetes'; and, 2) percent
A1C  6.5.

Ecological model
The ecological model suggests that changes in knowledge,
skills and attitudes will change behaviors and consequently
health outcomes. Behaviors that are hypothesized to
impact DSM health outcomes were measured in the
NHANES [10] and in the applied DSM model using the
`current behaviors' (dietary plans, weight management,
and physical activity changes). Patient provider communi-
cation is an assumption of the model and it was not mea-
sured in this study.
Measurements using the ecological model
Independent variables
Medical advice (on diet, weight management and physical
activity and `told by a doctor or health provider in the past
12 months'), fits into the ecological model as an environ-
mental influence which acts on the individual and helps to
promote health behavior change. Influences were measured
in NHANES [10] and in the applied model (Figure 1) using
1) `medical advice' (reduction of fat or calories, control or
loss of weight, increased physical activity or exercise); 2)
`diabetes education' (enhancing skills related to self-care);
and, 3) `race/ethnicity' (culture/health disparities). The
NHANES database [10] measures reported `medical advice'
without making a distinction among the healthcare provi-
der (the response choice for these questions were `told by a
doctor or health provider'). The response for diabetes edu-
cation was `When was the last time you saw a diabetes
nurse educator or dietitian or nutritionist. Do not include
doctors or other health professionals'.

Dependent variables
`Health Outcomes' measured in this study were the
changes in behavior related to diabetes self-management
(reporting reducing fat or calories in the diet, increasing
physical activity or exercise and controlling or losing
weight) (Figure 1). Questions on medical advice were
used for the first time by NHANES [10] and correspond
to recommendations from the Global Guideline for Type
2 Diabetes, lifestyle management standard care [11].
Medical advice questions examined in this study all
were phrased with the standard language `to lower your
risk for certain diseases, during the past 12 months have
you ever been told by a doctor or health professional to'
and the advice added for each question were 1) reduce
the amount of fat or calories in your diet; 2) increase
physical activity or exercise; and, 3) control weight or
lose weight. The health behavior questions were phrased
`To lower your risk for certain diseases, are you now
doing any of the following' and behavior added for each
question were: 1) reducing the amount of fat or calories
in your diet; 2) increasing your physical activity or exer-
cise; and, 3) controlling weight or losing weight. A vari-
able for recent diabetes education was created with two
categories (two years or less and more than 2 years or
never) based on responses from the following `When
was the last time you saw a diabetes nurse educator or
dietitian or nutritionist for your diabetes? Do not
include doctors or other health professionals'.
Logistic regression models were performed with
reporting receipt of medical advice within the past 12
months by race/ethnicity for each outcome of diabetes
self-management behavior. Specifically, the independent
variable for model 1 was binary responses to `told to
reduce fat or calories' and the dependent variable was
`currently reducing fat or calories'. Similarly, model 2
assessed the likelihood of `told to increase physical activ-
ity' with `currently increasing physical activity' and model
3 contained `told to control or reduce weight' as the inde-
pendent variable and `currently controlling or reducing
weight' as the dependent variable. Full models contained
age, gender, education, health insurance, overweight/
obese, and diabetes education.
Additional analysis dependent variable: obesity
A binary variable was constructed using a proxy measure
of obesity, body mass index (BMI). Classification was 
30 for `obese' and < 30 `not obese' with measurements of
weight in kg divided by height in m2 (kg/m2). Values
used for BMI for this study were calculated by direct
measurements taken in the MEC by NHANES. Next,
quartiles of BMI were compared with each medical
advice and behavior by the Chi Square Test.
Study questions
In this study, we assessed the following.
1. Whether the effect of medical advice on the likeli-
hood of performing the corresponding recommenda-
tions differs by race/ethnicity.
2. Whether individuals having `undiagnosed diabetes'
(no self-report of being diagnosed with diabetes and a
percent hemoglobin A1C  6.5) versus `diagnosed dia-
betes' (self-report of being diagnosed by a doctor or
health professional) would differ in the relationship
between given medical advice (yes/no) and its effect on
the corresponding behaviors.
3. Will the effect of reporting being told to control or
loss weight by reporting performing the behavior (con-
trolling or losing weight) be associated with obesity.
Data analysis
Sample weights were constructed and included in the
data sets to account for complex sample design and
achieve unbiased national estimates. The choice of sam-
ple weight was based on the data file with the smallest
sample size as recommended by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) guidelines [12]. Data analysis
was conducted with IBM-SPSS version 18 with a com-
plex sampling add-on. Prior to analysis, continuous vari-
ables were assessed for normality by Q-Q plots and
when needed, transformed. Post-analysis, continuous
variables were tested by residual graphs for skew. Hier-
archical logistic regression models were conducted for
medical advice by race/ethnicity predicting adequate/
inadequate DSM adding variables associated by the lit-
erature as covariates. We examined 3 different types of
medical advice, therefore a Bonferroni correction was
used to ensure an overall error rate of 0.05 and p <
0.017 was considered significant. Models were estimated
with and without covariates. Covariates considered
included age, gender, health insurance, diabetes educa-
tion and education. In addition, obesity was added for
`told to reduce fat or calories' and `told to increase phy-
sical activity; whereas overweight and obesity was
included for `told to control or loss weight'. The final
models retain covariates with p-values of  0.2 for diag-
nosed diabetes. Undiagnosed diabetes models were
adjusted for health insurance, age, gender, and body
mass index categories. The Wald F statistic was used to
determine model significance for complex logistic
regression analysis [13] where the degrees of freedom
are constrained to a constant value (the primary sam-
pling units minus the strata which equal 17 for this
data). Results are only presented for models which sig-
nificantly predicted the outcomes (values available upon
request). Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence limits
are presented for the model without covariates and
adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence limits
are presented for the models with covariates. Where

Results
Population characteristics
The general characteristics of the participants are shown in
Table 1. Over two-thirds of the sample was classified as
obese and 88% were classified as overweight based on their
body mass index (BMI). There were significant differences
among race/ethnicity for age and education. White non-
Hispanics were approximately 4 years older than BNH and
MA. There was not a significant difference in reporting
having health coverage in the past 12 months between
BNH (85.2%) and WNH (93.1%) (p = 0.055). However,
MA were significantly less likely to report having health
coverage (62%). In addition, over 40% of MA responded
they did not know how many times per year they saw their
doctor; whereas approximately half of BNH and WNH
reported they did not recall the number of doctor's visits
over the past year. Of those who reported number of doc-
tor visits, there were no significant differences among
participants by race/ethnicity; however, those reporting
specific frequencies may not be representative of their
group (data not shown). These results indicated there were
significant differences in access to health care in MA as
compared to WNH. Approximately one-third of the com-
bined sample reported not receiving advice to reduce fat/
calories, increase physical activity/exercise or control/lose
weight. Additionally, participants who were overweight or
obese were four times more likely to report receiving
advice to control or reduce their weight than individuals
with a normal body mass index (data not shown).
Medical advice, race/ethnicity, and behavior
The Odds Ratios for receiving medical advice and fol-
lowing medical advice are presented in Table 2 for par-
ticipants with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes.
There was a significantly greater chance of performing
the recommended behaviors if given the advice, inde-
pendent of ethnicity/race. Ethnicity/race did not differ
with respect to receiving advice and following it, neither
as a main effect nor as an interaction.

Diagnosed diabetes
Reporting `told to reduce fat or calories' Being told by
a medical provider to reduce fat or caloric intake was sig-
nificantly associated with an increased likelihood of
reporting having reduced fat or calories in both unad-
justed OR = 8.78 (5.57, 13.8)and in adjusted models AOR
= 6.87 (3.83, 12.3). The final covariates in the model were
age (p = 0.142), gender (p = 0.062), obesity (p = 0.166),
and diabetes education (p = 0.110). The relationship was
not modified by race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was not
significant with (p = 0.148) or without (p = 0.284) covari-
ates. Neither was the interaction, `told by race/ethnicity'
significant for any model (p = 0.344), no covariates; (p =
0.428), with covariates.
Reporting `told to increase physical activity or exer-
cise Respondents who reported that they had been told by
a medical provider (physician or other healthcare provider)
to increase physical activity or exercise were significantly
more likely to report having increased their physical activ-
ity or exercise in both the unadjusted OR = 6.53 (3.73,
11.4) and adjusted models AOR = 6.34 (3.55, 11.5). The
only covariates that remained in the adjusted model was
age (p = 0.011). There was no effect of race/ethnicity on
this relationship. Neither race/ethnicity [unadjusted (p =
0.866); adjusted (p = 0.906)] nor the interaction of `told by
race/ethnicity', were statistically significant [unadjusted
(p = 0.916); adjusted (p = 0.933)].
Reporting `told to control or lose weight' Respondents
who reported having been told to control or lose weight
were approximately four times more likely to report hav-
ing controlled or lost weight than those who did not
report being told, whether examining the unadjusted
[OR = 4.64 (2.32, 9.32)] or adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR =
4.13 (1.98, 8.62)]. Being overweight was the only covari-
ate that remained in the adjusted model. There was no
impact of race/ethnicity on this relationship. Neither the
main effect for race/ethnicity [unadjusted (p = 0.867);
adjusted (p = 0.849)], nor the interaction of `told by race/
ethnicity' were statistically significant [unadjusted (p =
0.610); adjusted (p = 0.688)].
Undiagnosed diabetes versus diagnosed diabetes
Medical advice variables in this study were not specific to
those with a diabetes diagnosis.. Exploratory chi-square
analyses revealed approximately half the participants with
`undiagnosed diabetes' did receive medical advice for
weight [46.9 (33.4, 61.0), SE = 6.6]; physical activity [52.7
(41.3, 63.9), SE = 5.4]; and, fat/calories [44.3 (31.9, 57.4),
SE = 6.1]. The percent of `undiagnosed' receiving the
advice was lower than for diagnosed cases where approxi-
mately two-thirds reported receiving medical advice for
weight [63.3 (57.7, 66.6), SE = 2.1]; physical activity [66.5
(60.0, 72.5), SE = 3.0]; and fat/calories [65.6(61.4, 69.7),
SE = 2.0]. Receiving medical advice for individuals who
were `undiagnosed was higher than for the general popu-
lation (20-27%) (data not shown). Table 2 presents the
OR and AOR for performing the recommended behavior
if given the advice for diagnosed (top of table) and
undiagnosed compared with diagnosed (bottom of table).
Diagnosis status was not related to engaging in any of the
health behaviors for the unadjusted [plose wt

= 0.740] or adjusted [plose wt

interactions of diagnosis status and being told to engage
in the health behavior were also not related to engaging

significant in the unadjusted (p < 0.001) and the
adjusted models (p < 0.001); where the main effect for
having lost weight was not statistically significant [unad-
justed (p = 0.432) and adjusted (p = 0.452)]. The inter-
action of being told and losing weight was associated
with obesity [(p = 0.009) unadjusted; (p = 0.023)
adjusted]. Race was not significant in the models [(p =
0.474) unadjusted; (p = 0.263) adjusted]. The resulting
odds ratios for the four groups showed that for the
group of participants who had not lost weight, the odds
of being obese if told to lose weight relative to not
being told to lose weight were the highest of the sub-
groups [OR = 17.7(7.06, 44.2); AOR = 16.5 (5.95, 45.5)].
For those who actually had lost weight, odds of obesity
for those who had been told were 4.31 (2.83, 6.02),
unadjusted and 4.74(3.09, 7.29), adjusted, relative to
those who had not been told. For the subgroup who
had not been told to lose weight, those who had actually
lost weigh had higher odds of being obese than those
who had not lost weight [OR = 2.70 (1.33, 5.980); AOR
= 2.43 (1.10, 5.36)]. Only for the subgroup who had
been told to lose weight was the act of actually losing
weight associated with lower likelihood of obesity,
though these odds were not significantly different from
1 [OR = 0.66 (0.26,1.68); AOR = 0.70 (0.28,1.77)]. Age,
gender, education and health insurance were tested for
the adjusted model. Education and health insurance
were removed to achieve model fit, leaving age and gen-
der as the covariates in the adjusted model.
BMI, medical advice and behavior
Individuals who received medical advice were more
likely to be in the upper quartiles of the BMI distribu-
tion for each medical advice. Similarly individuals who
reported having performed the behavior were also more
likely to have been in the upper quartiles of the BMI
distribution for reducing fat or calories and losing
weight, but not for increasing physical activity. The
median BMI within the groups who had and had not
received medical advice and engaged in the behavior is
shown in Table 3 to illustrate these results.
Discussion
The ecological model applied to this study was sup-
ported with certain limitations. Our result indicated
that, regardless of race/ethnicity, individuals with dia-
betes who reported being given medical advice to per-
form essential DSM behaviors: reducing fat or calories;
increasing physical activity or exercise; and, controlling
or losing weight, were more likely to report performing
the corresponding behavior than those who were not
told. Weight reduction and management, an important
aspect of DSM, can be achieved by reducing fat or cal-
ories and increasing physical activity. Performing these
skills is central to the recommendations for persons
with type 2 diabetes by the ADA [6].
Despite the recommendation by ADA that all persons
with diabetes be given this medical advice, approxi-
mately one-third of the combined sample reported not
receiving advice to reduce fat/calories, increase physical
activity/exercise or control/lose weight. Participants in
the normal weight category were four times less likely
to report receiving advice to control or reduce their
weight as compared to individuals in the overweight or
obese category. Understanding the context of medical
advice and diabetes care within the ecological model
may be of value for understanding these discrepancies.
Diabetes is a public health problem requiring a multi-
level systems approach for prevention and treatment
[14]. The population-based approach advocated by Glas-
gow et al [14] includes personal, family, health care
team, and community influences that impact the promo-
tion or inhibition of diabetes self-management and life-
style changes. A key factor, interwoven through each
system, is communication. Investigations concerning the
relationship between patient-provider communication
and health behavior were conducted in the late 1960's
[15]. There have been detailed protocols for medical
advice, which included collaborative goal setting, in the
field of nursing since the 1960's. Despite these advances,
process and outcome evaluation of patient-provider
communication remains underdeveloped. The complex
dynamics of interpersonal relationships makes assess-
ment of `culturally sensitive and collaborative,' patient-
provider communication difficult. Moreover, few studies
have investigated whether the message was received in
the manner it was intended for diabetes patients and if
race/ethnicity affected the communication process.
Several studies have indicated health disparities by
race/ethnicity have occurred in participatory provider-
patient relationships [16-19]. There is some evidence
that improvements in diabetes outcomes may not occur
for minority patients, even when physicians are made
aware of racial disparity in diabetes care and outcomes
[20]. A 12-month, randomized controlled trial applying

cultural competency training found no improvements in
diabetes outcomes, despite the physicians' increased
awareness of health disparities [20]. For this study, it
was conceivable that some patients received the stan-
dard, recommended advice but did not process the
information. We are not sure to what degree the com-
munication was received as intended and if there were
variations by race/ethnicity. Consequently, patient-provi-
der communication may have been a confounder in
determining whether receiving medical advice resulted
in the corresponding DSM behaviors. Since patient-pro-
vider communication was not measured but may have
influenced health outcomes, it was considered a precur-
sor for this study's theoretical model.
With respect to our theoretical model's categories of
current behavior leading to health outcomes, several
points need to be clarified. First, medical advice given
was measured by self reporting. The communication
process, together with the patient's health beliefs and
personal characteristics (knowledge, motivation, and
self-efficacy) were factors in determining if the advice
given was understood as it was intended. Second, medi-
cal advice may not be the driving force changing beha-
viors to the corresponding desired health outcomes. It is
not known if the participants were performing these
dietary and physical activity behaviors prior to being
given medical advice. The inclusion of questions regard-
ing the connection of advice with the corresponding
behaviors by subsequent NHANES would be needed to
clarify their associations.
Another difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of
medical advice was the nature of the questions. Medical
advice and health behavior questions asked by NHANES
were broad. The recommendations for lifestyle manage-
ment comprehensive care includes this advice; albeit
with individual advice on diet and physical activity as
well as ongoing counseling and access to a dietitian or
healthcare professional trained in nutrition. The ques-
tions did not specify the clinical profession who gave
the advice (such as physician, nurse, nurse practitioner,
or dietitian) or the quality and frequency of the advice.
Strengths and limitations
There were several limitations of this study. First, cause
and effect could not be established by this study since the
data were comparing groups from a single time point.
Second, there may have been subject bias in some of the
variables. The demographic data and data concerning
medical advice received were self-reported. It may be
that those participants who followed advice were more
likely to remember being given the advice. Third, the
comparisons by race/ethnicity were not of completely
homogenous groups. Within the category "Black, non-
Hispanic" several Caribbean cultures were combined
with African American. Immigrant minorities (Haitian
versus English-speaking, Caribbean Blacks) are likely to
have acculturation and health belief differences from
non-immigrant minorities (African Americans). Within
the "Mexican American" classification differences in
length of time in the United States accounted for varia-
tion of homogeneity. Even though NHANES over-sam-
ples the poor for each racial group, and the variable
education level was chosen as a control, income could
not be completely equalized across groups. Fourth, there
were variations in exposure variables. While the major
exposure variables for medical advice were standard
question, their interpretation may vary by the individual
or across race/ethnicities. For example, the quantity and
quality of the specific dietary and physical activity recom-
mendations were not asked and interpretation may vary
by race/ethnicity. Comparably, diabetes education varied
by frequency (within the past two years) and duration
(contact time with the diabetes educator) and may have
differed in quality. It was possible that the exposure to
diabetes education could have been unequal across race/
ethnicity. Finally, the comparisons of the diagnosed and
undiagnosed (based on A1C) were of relatively low
power and whereas no statistically significant impact was

its degrees of freedom (adjusted for complex design). The adjusted F is a variant of the second-order Rao-Scott adjusted Chi-Square statistic.

found, there were clinically important differences in the
estimated Odds Ratios for these two groups. Further
examination of individuals with undiagnosed probable
diabetes is warranted.
One limitation of this study was the limited data inher-
ent in all secondary analysis research. In particular, data
regarding the patient-provider communication processes
were absent in the NHANES database; hence in this study.
It has been well-documented that the patients' participa-
tion in treatment goals improves health outcomes. Despite
the limitations, a major strength of this study was the use
of a national database (NHANES), which has specialized
in collecting health data by race/ethnicity. Since this was
the first year that NHANES [10] included data concerning
medical advice for DSM; this study was one of the first to
use a national database to assess health disparities of
reported medical recommendations.
Conclusions
This study has demonstrated the association of specific
medical advice and the self-management behaviors for
three nationally represented racial/ethnic groups with dia-
betes. Although the literature indicates race/ethnic differ-
ences in health behavior, these findings suggest diabetes
self-management may be influenced by medical advice,
independent of race/ethnicity. It is recommended that
healthcare providers reinforce specific weight management
advice for patients at every opportunity. Case studies and
longitudinal investigations are needed to determine causal-
ity among quality of patient-provider communication,
standards of care received, and corresponding behaviors.
