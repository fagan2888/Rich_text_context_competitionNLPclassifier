This analysis describes the relationship between age and transitions from four living
arrangements: living alone, living with spouse only, living with a child, and living with a
spouse and child. Data from the National Survey of Families and Households, collected
in 1987-88 and 1992-93, are used to calculate destination-specific hazard rates by
age and then construct multiple-decrement life tables. Living alone or with a spouse are
the most stable living arrangements during the early stages of later life, whereas for
the oldest-old, living with a child is the most stable living arrangement. The young-old
tend to exit living arrangements through changes in coresidence, whereas transitions
among the oldest-old are primarily due to institutionalization and death.

Among America's Older Adults

The Relationship Between Living
Arrangements and Age
During the last 20 years a considerable amount of
research on living arrangements among older adults
has been presented in journals that address aging
issues. A variety of studies in this area use cross-
sectional data to document trends in the distribution
of living arrangements among the older population
and to identify the factors that determine living ar-
rangements (Avery, Speare, & Lawton, 1989; Burr &
Mutchler, 1992; Soldo, Wolf, & Agree, 1990; Worobey
& Angel, 1990a). With the increased availability of
nationally representative longitudinal data sets, re-
search has begun to describe changes in living arrange-
ments over time (Mutchler & Burr, 1991; Speare, Avery,
& Lawton, 1991; Spitze, Logan, & Robinson, 1992;
Worobey & Angel, 1990b).
Studies demonstrate that the relationship between
age and living arrangements at one point in time is
distinct from the relationship between age and living
arrangement transitions that occur over time. For ex-
ample, even though there is a positive relationship be-
tween age and living alone among unmarried women,
the probability of experiencing a transition into living

alone decreases with age (Mutchler, 1992). Despite
this distinction, our understanding of the relationship
between living arrangement transitions and age is not
complete due to data limitations.
Previous studies that used longitudinal data often
employed a restrictive analysis strategy because of data
limitations (e.g., Jackson, Longino, Zimmerman, & Brad-
sher, 1991; Mutchler & Burr, 1991; Speare etal., 1991;
Spitze et al., 1992; Worobey & Ansel 1990b). The
strategy involves coding individuals who are in differ-
ent living arrangements at subsequent interviews as
experiencing an event and then using logistic re-
gression to model the influence of various respondent
characteristics on the likelihood of living arrangement
change. This approach, while providing some insight
into the determinants of living arrangement changes,
has some important limitations.
First, a respondent could have experienced a living
arrangement change between the two interview dates
that is not included in the analysis because the re-
spondent moved back into his or her original state
prior to the end of the observation period. Another
problem is the respondent could have experienced
several transitions during the period but only the dif-
ference between the beginning state and the end-
ing state is modeled. This is problematic because the
changes being modeled are not an accurate represen-
tation of the transition process. Finally, little informa-
tion is gained about the transition process itself from
this methodological approach. We still do not know
how long it tates respondents to experience living
arrangement transitions or how this process varies with
age-
Furthermore, many of these studies focus only on
unmarried women (e.g., Mutchler, 1992; Soldo et al.,
1990; Worobey & Angel, 1990b) for several related
reasons. While the majority of the older population
434 The Gerontologist
lives with a spouse, married couple households are
often excluded because there is little variation in the
baseline living arrangements of this group--the ma-
jority of married individuals live with a spouse. Simi-
larly, men tend to be excluded from living arrange-
ment research because they are more likely to be mar-
ried and living with a spouse due to sex differences in
mortality. In contrast to married individuals and men,
the living arrangements of unmarried women have
greater variability. Older women are more likely than
men to be living alone, with relatives, or in an institu-
tion (Siegel, 1993). In addition, unmarried women, par-
ticularly those living alone, are of concern in terms of
policy because they are at risk of needing more in-
formal and formal assistance. Although focusing on un-
married women is justified, excluding married couples
and men has curbed our understanding of living
arrangement transitions for the entire older adult
population and limited our ability to provide the gen-
eralizations that may inform policy.
This research addresses the methodological and
sample limitations of previous research by examining
living arrangements from a dynamic perspective that
uses event history methods to describe the transition
process among the entire older adult population. The
purpose of this study is to expand upon our current
knowledge concerning living arrangements among
older adults by providing more detailed information
about the living arrangement transition process and
how that process varies over the latter part of the life
course. The goal is to provide a more complete de-
scription of living arrangement changes in later life that
can inform individual and policy decision making.
Using data from the National Survey of Families
and Households (NSFH) this research specifies the
stochastic nature of living arrangements by tracking
individual changes in living arrangements on a month-
to-month basis. The monthly information is used to
create event history files that document the first tran-
sition from a living arrangement by age and to calcu-
late age-specific transition rates. The transition rates
are then used to construct multiple-decrement life
tables for four living arrangement categories: living
alone, living with a spouse, living with a child, and
living with a spouse and child.
The multiple-decrement life tables provide answers
to research questions concerning living arrangement
transitions that, until this point, have not been ad-
dressed. More specifically, this research addresses the
following questions:
1. How likely is it that an older person in a par-
ticular living arrangement will make a transition to
another type of living arrangement?
2. How are living arrangement transitions related
to age and distributed over the latter part of the life
course? Similarly, what is the pace of these transitions?
3. How long can an individual expect to live in a
particular living arrangement before experiencing a liv-
ing arrangement change?
Providing answers to these questions can inform
individual and policy decision making by providing
insight into the stability of particular later life living
arrangements and the predictability of specific living
arrangement transitions. In this study, stability depends
upon the overall likelihood of a living arrangement
transition at a given age. A living arrangement is stable
when the chance of a transition is low and an indi-
vidual can expect to remain in that current living
arrangement for several years before experiencing a
change. Predictability, on the other hand, refers to the
degree to which an individual can expect a specific
type of living arrangement transition, given his or her
current living arrangement and age. If an individual
can expect to experience a specific type of living
arrangement change at a given age (e.g., moving from
living with a spouse to living alone, or from living alone
to an institution), then that transition is predictable.
Know-ing the stability of a living arrangement, as well
as the most likely type of transition to be experienced
at a given age, enables individuals to prepare for the
events that are likely to occur during later life and
assists policy makers, as well as service providers, in
developing and implementing programs that are tai-
lored to meet older adults' needs.
Methods
Data Source and Living Arrangement
Transition Measures
This analysis uses data from the first and second
waves of the National Survey of Families and House-
holds (NSFH). The 1987-1988 NSFH contains a na-
tionally representative sample of 13,017 respondents
aged 19 and older living in U.S. households. The ini-
tial NSFH sample was followed up in 1992-1993. The
present analysis is based upon the 3,339 reinter-
viewed respondents who were age 55 or older dur-
ing the first interview, as well as the respondents who
were age 50 to 54 and turned 55 between the first
and second interviews. While most studies of older
adults' living arrangements use subjects that are age
65 and older, expanding the age range to 55 and
older enables this research to address transition issues
among the pre- and early retirement age population.
It should be noted that there are 630 subjects who
were not reinterviewed and therefore are not included
in this analysis. This attrition is a cause for concern
because of the potential for dependency between the
attrition mechanism and changes in living arrange-
ments. To account for this potential dependency, an
attrition variable was created by first estimating a
logistic regression model predicting attrition (0 = rein-
terviewed respondents, 1 = respondents not reinter-
viewed). Then the coefficients for sex, race, educa-
tion, and self-rated health from this model were used
to create an attrition control variable that is included
in all of the models used in this analysis (Heckman,
1979; Berk, 1983).
A unique feature of the NSFH data is that dates of
changes in marital status, living with children, institu-
tionalization, and death are coded in century months.
The household composition items from the initial
Vol. 38, No. 4, 1998 435
survey are used to determine baseline living arrange-
ments and then the items that measure changes in
marital status and living with children in the follow-up
survey are used to determine monthly changes in liv-
ing arrangements. Together these items are used to
construct an event history file that tracks first transi-
tions out of the following living arrangement cate-
gories: living alone, living with a spouse, living with a
child, and living with a spouse and child. Overall, 1,038
respondents are coded as experiencing a change
in living arrangements at age 55 and older. The num-
ber of respondents experiencing destination-specific
transitions is shown in Table 1. It is the experience
of these respondents that is modeled in the hazard
analysis and multiple-decrement life tables, which are
discussed below.
For the majority (97%) of the participants that ex-
perience a transition to living with a child, it is impos-
sible to determine whether the respondent moved
into a child's household or a child moved into the
respondent's household. This is primarily due to the
way the follow-up data were collected. The only spe-
cific questions about a respondent moving into a
child's household are on the proxy interview. No dis-
tinction is made between a child moving into the
respondent's household and the respondent moving
into a child's household during the respondent rein-
terview. The question wording implies that the child
is moving into the respondent's household, but it is
not possible to verify this information. Similarly, it cannot
be determined whether transitions from living with a
child to living alone involved the child or the respon-
dent moving. Given these data limitations the results
only discuss transitions involving children in terms of
coresidence.
Analysis
The analysis uses a Markov-based approach in which
living arrangement transitions are conceptualized as
a process in which individuals are in one of several
mutually exclusive and exhaustive states at any given
point in time. Over time individuals move between
these four different living arrangement states in addi-
tion to experiencing institutionalization or death. This
movement between states creates a history of living
arrangement transitions (or nontransitions for cases in
which no change in living arrangements occurs). Al-
though individuals potentially can make multiple tran-
sitions, this analysis focuses on the first transition out
of the baseline living arrangement. The analysis fo-
cuses on first transitions because the primary goal
of this article is to explore the relationship between
living arrangement changes and age, as well as to iden-
tify the length of time an individual can expect to live
in a particular living arrangement before experiencing
a transition.
Living arrangement transitions are modeled by
constructing multiple-decrement life tables that are
based upon age-specific hazard rates. These estimated
hazard rates are a function of the baseline hazard
rate, age, and a vector of control variables where
= Bo
+ B^Age B,Xr
(1)
In this equation the constant Bo
represents the baseline
hazard function, B, represents the effect of age, and
B. represents several control variables including gen-
der (female vs male), race (White vs non-White), edu-
cation (some college or more vs high school or less),
functional limitations (scale of 0 to 1 that measures six
tasks including conditions that limit the ability to care
for personal needs, move around the house, perform
day-to-day tasks, climb a flight of stairs, and walk six
blocks), and number of children. These control vari-
ables are included in the hazard model because each
of these factors has been shown to be significantly
related to living arrangements in previous research
(Mutchler & Burr, 1991; Soldo et al., 1990; Worobey
& Angel, 1990b). Although this article does not pre-
sent the coefficients for these control variables, includ-
ing the controls in the hazard models is essential for
model specification; it ensures that the age-specific
hazard rates obtained from the models are not affected
by other individual characteristics that are related to
changes in living arrangements. For this analysis the
age-specific hazard rates are estimated using the Proc
Lifereg procedure in SAS.
Although Equation 1 only allows for age to have a
linear effect, other functional forms of time can be

specified. Models (not shown) were tested that in-
cluded various functional forms of time (i.e., age, age2).
The appropriate functional form for the relationship
between the unobserved hazard rate and time was
determined by comparing the Wald chi-square sta-
tistics across the models. The best fitting models were
used to calculate the age-specific transition rates that
are the basis of the multiple-decrement life tables.
Using the hazard model with the most appropriate
functional form for time, age-specific hazards rates are
obtained by the following formula:
h(x) = EXP{-[B0
. · . + Bi
(Controli
)]}. (2)
These age-specific hazards rates are then applied to
a synthetic life table cohort, which identifies the ex-
pected living arrangement transitions across the latter
part of the life course given current age-specific tran-
sition rates. Multiple-decrement life tables are con-
structed for each of the following baseline living
arrangements: living alone, with spouse, with child, with
spouse and child (see Schoen, 1988, for a discussion
of multiple-decrement life tables). In addition to mod-
eling transitions between these living arrangements,
the life tables also model transitions into an institution
or death.
The results in the following section use graphs and
tables to summarize the detailed information pro-
vided by the multiple-decrement life tables. The dis-
cussion focuses on the life table survivor functions, the
overall transition probabilities, the expected number

of years until a living arrangement transition, the age-
specific transitions rates, and the percent distribution
of decrements at selected ages.
Results
General Patterns in Living
Arrangement Transitions
The life table models subject a hypothetical cohort
of 100,000 people at age 55 to the age-specific living
arrangement transitions rates. Figure 1 is based on the
survivorship function, or l(x) column, in each life table.
This function provides information on the number of
people in the hypothetical cohort who have not ex-
perienced a transition out of the designated living
arrangement by a given age. In other words, these
people have "survived" to a particular age without
experiencing a living arrangement change. Mathe-
matically, the number of people who "survived" to
agex
without a living arrangement change is equal to
the number of people at age*-i minus the number of
people who experience a living arrangement change
while age*-i.
To facilitate the interpretation, Figure 1 graphically
presents the percentage of the synthetic cohort that
has not experienced a living arrangement transition at
each successive age. In other words, it indicates the
percentage of the initial population that continues to
be in that living arrangement at a given age. As the
curve of the lines indicates, there is a steady decline

or with a spouse. The decline in the percentage of
individuals living with a child is more rapid, and indi-
viduals living with a spouse and child experience the
most rapid pace of living arrangement change.
Additional insight into the transition process can be
gained from examining the age-specific transition prob-
abilities for each living arrangement category shown
in Figure 2. These transition probabilities are derived
from the age-specific hazard rates that were used to
construct each life table. Although there are some
differences across the living arrangement categories,
the most striking characteristic of Figure 2 is that the
probability of experiencing a transition is relatively low
for all groups until age 75, when it begins to steadily
increase. Prior to age 65 the probability of making a
transition is slightly higher for those living with a child
or with a spouse and child. At these oldest ages, the
probability of experiencing a transition is highest for
individuals living with a spouse and child, followed by
those living alone, with a spouse, and with a child
respectively.
Table 2 presents additional information concerning
the pace at which living arrangement changes occur
during later life. These values are based on the e(x)
column in each life table, which is derived from the
total number of years spent in a particular living ar-
rangement at and above a given age (i.e., the T{x)
function) and the survivorship function (i.e., /(x)). The
e(x) function provides information on the number of
years, on average, an individual can expect to live in

a particular living arrangement before experiencing
a living arrangement change. For example, at age 55
individuals living alone can expect, on average, twenty
years before a change in living arrangements.
The expected number of years of living alone de-
clines steadily with age. The pattern of expected num-
ber of years before the first living arrangement transi-
tion for individuals living with a spouse is very similar
to the pattern for those living alone, although the ini-
tial expectancy is lower. This similarity between indi-
viduals living alone and living with a spouse is due to
the fact that exits from both living arrangements are
usually driven by mortality and institutionalization.

a child experience a relatively rapid exit from that

living arrangement (as indicated by the previously
discussed survival curves), those individuals who do
not make a living arrangement transition can expect
to live with their child for several more years. In fact,
at age 65 and older individuals living with a child
remain in that living arrangement a longer period
of time, on average, than individuals in other living
arrangements. In contrast, individuals living with a
spouse and child change living arrangements the quick-
est, therefore the expected number of years until a
transition is relatively low.
While Figures 1 and 2, as well as Table 2, summa-
rize the overall transition trends for each living ar-
rangement category, they do not provide any infor-
mation regarding the distribution of specific transition
types within each living arrangement category. The
following analysis will examine transitions from each
living arrangement separately and discuss the similari-
ties across the living arrangement categories.
Destination-Specific Transition Patterns
Within Each Living Arrangement Category
Living Alone.--There are four paths through which
an individual living alone can change living arrange-
ments: by getting married, coresiding with a child,
moving into an institution, or dying. As the curve of
the line in Figure 3 indicates, the destination-specific
transition rates for movements from living alone to liv-
ing with a spouse are concentrated at the younger
ages and decline with age, although the overall rates
are relatively low. The first panel of Table 3, which
presents the percent distribution of transitions, shows
that at age 55 only 6% of the transitions from living
alone are to living with a spouse and that this per-
centage declines steadily with age. Transition rates for
movement to coresidence with a child also decline
with age. At age 55 almost two thirds (65%) of the
transitions from living alone are to living with a child.
After age 80 it is unlikely that an individual will exit
living alone by getting married, although there is a
slight chance that an individual will coreside with a
child. Less than 6% of the transitions at age 85 are
accounted for by coresidential moves. It is only at the
youngest ages (prior to age 65) that individuals living
alone are most likely to start living with a child.
As anticipated, there is a positive relationship be-
tween age and transitions due to institutionalization
and death for individuals living alone. Institutionaliza-
tion and death are the predominate paths through
which individuals exit living alone after age 62. Only
29% of the transitions at age 55 are due to death or
institutionalization, but by age 85 almost all of the tran-
sitions out of living alone are for these reasons.
Living With a Spouse.--Individuals living with a
spouse experience a change in living arrangement
when a child moves into the household (or the couple
moves in with a child), a spouse dies or the marriage
dissolves, or the individual is institutionalized or dies.
It is also possible for a spouse to be institutionalized
but this process cannot be modeled with these data.

aPercentages are based on the destination-specific cf'(x) and overall
d(x) functions in the multiple-decrement life table, which are de-
rived from the transition rates shown in Figures 3 through 6. The
d'(x) represents the number of destination-specific living arrange-
ment transitions that occur in a given age interval. It is the prod-
uct of the number of people surviving to agex
and the probability
that a specific type of living arrangement change will occur be-
tween agex
and agex+1
. The d(x) function, which represents the
total number of transitions that occur during a given age interval,
is equal to the sum of the destination-specific decrements during
a given age interval (i.e., d(x) = I d'(x)). The percentages in this
table were obtained by dividing c/'(x) by d(x) then multiplying by
100.
Figure 4 shows that the destination-specific rates for
movements from living with a spouse to living with a
spouse and child decline steadily with age, but the
rates of exits due to individual death or institutional-
ization increase exponentially with age. The second
panel of Table 3 indicates that at age 55 the predomi-
nant way individuals exit living with a spouse is by
coresiding with a child. Death and institutionalization
become the most common pathways of exiting this
type of living arrangement after age 65.
Living With a Child.--Individuals living with a child
experience a change in living arrangements when the
respondent gets married, the child or the respondent
moves out, or the individual is institutionalized or dies.
In this analysis, transitions to living with a spouse only
or with a spouse and child are not shown because
these transitions are fairly rare events. There were not
enough cases in the sample that experienced these
transitions to support a hazard analysis.
The third panel of Table 3 indicates that over three
fourths of transitions out of this living arrangement
are to living alone while less than one fourth are
to death or institutionalization. Yet the paths through
which one is likely to exit living with a child vary with
age. As shown in Figure 5, individuals living with a
child have a high risk of changing living arrangements
due to the movement of the child (or the respondent)
out of the household. At age 55 the percentage of
transitions attributed to living alone is 98%. By age 75
only 39% of the transitions are to living alone, and by
age 85 this percentage declines to only 22%.
The transition rates for movements from living with
a child to institutionalization or death slowly increase
with age. Exits due to these events account for less
than 2% of the transitions at age 55, but by age 85,
78% of the transitions from living with a child are due
to institutionalization or death.
Living With a Spouse and Child.--Changes in
living arrangements that involve both a spouse and
a child occur when the individual is institutionalized
or dies, the child (or the couple) moves out of the
household, or the marriage is dissolved through a
spouse's death or divorce. As shown in the last panel
of Table 3, the risk of experiencing a change in living
arrangements due to the movement of a child (or the
respondent) out of the household is greatest prior to
age 70. Eighty-two percent of the transitions at age
55 are through the exit of a child (or the respondent)
from the household. After age 70 very few of the
transitions are due to this cause.
Figure 6 presents the destination-specific transition
rates for individuals living with both a spouse and a
child. As the slope of the line indicates, the risk of
exiting due to the movement of a child (or the re-
spondent) from the household increases slightly from
age 55 to 60 then decreases rapidly. In contrast, the
transition rates due to death or institutionalization in-
crease dramatically after age 70. Whereas death or
institutionalization account for 14% of the transitions
at age 55, by age 85 virtually all of the exits are due
to these events.
There is not a significant relationship between age
and transitions from living with a spouse and a child
to living with a child only. Yet, the percentage of transi-
tions to living with a child varies by age because of
the competing risk nature of the living arrangement
process. As the percentage of transitions to living with
a spouse declines with age and the percentage of transi-
tions due to death or institutionalization increases, the
percentage of transitions to living with a child gradu-
ally decreases.

findings of previous research that suggest living arrange-
ments in later life are relatively stable (e.g., Mutchler,
1992; Schwartz, Danzieer, & Smolensky, 1984), this
research demonstrates tnat the degree of stability de-
pends upon the particular living arrangement under
consideration and the age of the individual.
Among all of the living arrangement categories in
this analysis, the most stable living arrangements be-
tween the ages of 55 and 65 are living alone or with
a spouse, yet after age 70 the most stable living
arrangement is with a child. Even though individuals
living with a child tend to experience a relatively rapid
transition out of these living arrangements during the
pre- and early retirement years, individuals who con-
tinue to live with a child into their 70s tend to remain
in this living arrangement longer than those who are
in other living arrangements. On the other hand, de-
spite the relative stability of living alone at younger
ages, after age 70 this living arrangement becomes
fairly unstable due to the high probability of death
and institutionalization. Given that the transition rates
for living alone are relatively low during the young-
old ages and that the majority of transitions out of
this living arrangement are through death or institu-
tionalization, these results support Mutchler's (1992)
assertion that living alone is "a (nearly) absorbing
state." However, even living alone has a varying de-
gree of stability across later life. Thus, the degree of
stability in a particular living arrangement varies with
age.
While at particular ages certain living arrangements
are more stable than others, the results do not dem-
onstrate that living arrangements in later life are static:
transitions occur throughout later life regardless of
the living arrangement category. Although the likeli-
hood of a transition tends to increase with age, transi-
tions do occur during the pre- and early retirement
years. Transitions during these younger ages are par-
ticularly likely for individuals living with a child or with
a spouse and child. Yet even for individuals in the
more "stable" living arrangements for those ages--
living alone or witn a spouse--transitions are not
uncommon. Thus, although particular living arrange-
ments are more stable than others at different points
in later life, none are immutable.
Despite the unique characteristics of each living ar-
rangement category, a comparison of the destination-
specific hazard rates in Figures 3 through 6 indicates
there are predictable transition patterns across the
latter part of the life course. Similar to living arrange-
ment transitions that occur during young adulthood,
there are limited options that are most likely to occur
at particular ages. The following discussion describes
the predictable relationships between each destination-
specific transition and age.
Unlike previous living arrangement research that fo-
cused only on unmarried respondents, this research
was able to identify the relationship between age and
transitions involving a spouse. Transitions involving a
marital union, which are relatively rare, are concen-
trated among the young-old ana decline with age.
Transitions due to marital dissolution were positively
442 The Gerontologist
related to age for individuals living with a spouse and
unrelated to age for individuals living with a spouse
and child. These specific transitions may be relatively
low and stable for two related reasons. First, these transi-
tions are due to two competing events--separation
or divorce and death of a spouse--each of which has
a different relationship with age. Secondly, transitions
due to the institutionalization of a spouse are not cap-
tured by this analysis because of data limitations. As
a result, the marital dissolution transition rates in this
analysis are most likely conservative estimates of the
marital dissolution process among the oldest-old.
Transitions involving coresidence with a child are
negatively related to age. This result was expected for
individuals living with a spouse but not for those liv-
ing alone. This finding provides limited support to pre-
vious research that suggests coresidence is often due
to the needs of the adult child and not the needs
of the aging parent (Aquilino, 1990; Ward, Logan, &
Spitze, 1993). If coresidence is driven by parental
need then the transition rate for moves to living with
a child should increase with age, especially for indi-
viduals living alone.
Overall, these results suggest that transition rates be-
tween living arrangements within the community (i.e.,
alone, with spouse, with child, or with spouse and
child) are relatively low and are concentrated prima-
rily among the relatively young who are living with a
child or a spouse and child. Consistent with the find-
ings of previous research (e.g., Mutchler & Burr, 1991;
Spitze et al., 1992), the results indicate that the risk
of exiting due to death or institutionalization increases
with age regardless of initial living arrangement state.
The highest transition rates, regardless of living ar-
rangement category, are for transitions into an institu-
tion or death. After age 75 the most likely path through
which older individuals exit any community-based liv-
ing arrangement is through these two transitions.
Given that the transition rates are highest after age
75 and transitions after age 75 are overwhelming due
to institutionalization or death, one might conclude
that most transitions in later life will be to an institu-
tion or death. This conclusion, however, does not ac-
knowledge the diversity of experience that is docu-
mented in this analysis. For example, Table 3 indi-
cates that despite the high transition rates into institu-
tionalization or death at older ages, the predominate
pathway through which individuals living with a child
or with a spouse and child exit those living arrange-
ments is via the dissolution of a coresidential living
arrangement. Furthermore, even at the oldest ages there
is still a chance, albeit relatively small, that a commu-
nity-based transition will occur. For instance, at age
75, 39% of the transitions from living with a child are
to living alone. Therefore, generalizations should not
be made concerning the most likely transition type
for all older adults regardless of living arrangement
category. The most likely transition type depends first
upon the age and second upon the living arrange-
ment category under consideration.
These results suggest individual decision making re-
garding living arrangements has to take into account
the conditional nature of later life living arrangements.
Relatively young older adults, in the pre- or early re-
tirement years, who are living alone or with a spouse
can expect that their living arrangements will not
change. If a transition is experienced, it will most likely
be due to coresidence with a child or a change in
marital status. Individuals living with a child or spouse
and child during these early years of later life should
expect their living arrangements to change, primarily
due to the dissolution of coresidence with a chila.
With increased age, living arrangements become more
unstable, so individuals should plan for impending
changes. As previously mentioned, during these later
years individuals living with a child are at the lowest
risk of changing living arrangements, but regardless
of living arrangements all older adults should be pre-
pared for a living arrangement change. Although tran-
sitions involving institutionalization and death are most
likely, it is still possible for transitions within the com-
munity to occur.
Service providers and policy makers should realize
that the needs of the older population depend upon
the stability of particular living arrangements and the
types of changes that are likely to occur. For example,
individuals in more unstable living arrangements, par-
ticularly the oldest-old living alone or with a spouse
and child, will need assistance maintaining their cur-
rent living arrangement and planning for future transi-
tions. Programs that educate older adults about the
advantages and disadvantages of reverse mortgages,
as well as long-term care insurance, can assist these
high-risk groups by providing insight into different
options for financially managing current and future
living arrangements. In addition, given that living with
a child is the most stable living arrangement among
the oldest-old, programs that provide caregiving assis-
tance to older adults, such as respite and day care,
should be particularly important to families who are
living with an older adult. Instead of implementing
general policies for the older population, these find-
ings suggest particular programs will be of use to
certain living arrangement groups.
While this analysis has provided insight into how
first living arrangement transitions are distributed
over the later life course, there is more to be learned
about the transition process. Future research should
focus on transitions involving others, including grand-
children and nonrelatives, as well as transitions out of
institutions. In addition, subsequent transitions should
be examined with increment-decrement life table
methods that model the complexity of transitions into
and out of various living arrangement states. Although
examining subsequent transitions would provide a
more detailed picture of the living arrangement tran-
sition process, it would not change the results re-
ported in this analysis regarding the timing of first
transitions or provide additional information about
the pace of first transitions. It would simply provide a
more complete understanding of the entire transition
process.
As the previous discussion implies, there are sev-
eral dimensions of living arrangements in later life
that are not understood fully. The increasing availabil-
ity of data that include transition information will
Vol. 38, No. 4,1998 443
enable researchers to explore the living arrangement
process in more detail. Explaining the living arrange-
ment transition process will clarify the changing house-
hold context in which older adults live and identify
the factors that prompt changes in household struc-
ture. This information will enable individuals and
service providers to plan more effectively for the con-
tingencies of later life living arrangements.
