Data advisory with regard to NHANES serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D data
Dear Sir:
We are writing to alert readers that a data advisory with regard to
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has recently
been posted on the NHANES website (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes/new_nhanes.htm). This advisory outlines 2 issues that all
users of NHANES serum 25OHD data need to consider.
The purpose of our letter is to discuss the data advisory in relation
to our recently published article that used NHANES serum 25(OH)D
data (1). The first issue outlined in the data advisory is the need to
adjust the serum 25(OH)D data from NHANES III to make valid
comparisons with serum 25(OH)D data collected in NHANES since
2000. The exploration of this issue was one of the major objectives
of our study, and the final conclusions about differences between
NHANES III and NHANES 2000­2004 accounted for the methodo-
logic difference between surveys. The first issue outlined in the data
advisory was fully addressed in our article and therefore does not
affect our results.
The second issue noted in the advisory describes drifts in assay
comparability for the serum 25(OH)D data collected since 2000.
The effect of these drifts on the population data were not fully recog-
nized until after the publication of our article and thus was not
addressed in our analyses. When we became aware of this issue, we
immediately conducted an analysis to address its effect on our pub-
lished results for serum 25(OH)D from NHANES 2000­2004. The
analyses were repeated after the exclusion of the data of concern, and
those results were compared with the results published in the Journal.
The results of these analyses are described in detail in the data ad-
visory. Briefly, the effect of excluding the data of concern on our pub-
lished results was minimal. Exclusion of the data of concern resulted
in means and percentiles for NHANES 2000­2004 that were slightly
lower (by 1­2 nmol/L) and estimates of the prevalence of low serum
25(OH)D values that were slightly higher (by 1­2 units) than those
originallyobtainedwhentheentire2000­2004datasetwasused.Study
conclusions were not affected.
In summary,the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention(CDC)
haspostedadataadvisorywithregardtoserum25(OH)Ddatafromthe
NHANES that identifies one issue, assay variability since 2000, that is
relevanttoourstudy.Ouradditionalanalysesindicateaminimal effect
ofthisissueonourresults.WorkisplannedbytheCDCtoaddressboth
issues raised in the data advisory by using the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference materials (SRM)
for serum 25(OH)D (2). That work will likely take many months to
complete, however, and the CDC did not want to wait before inform-
ing the user community. When the NIST SRM results become avail-
able, we plan to reevaluate our published results, and we will provide
an update at that time, if necessary.

b-Carotene from rice for human nutrition?
Dear Sir:
The article by Tang et al (1) represents a valuable contribution to
the discussion about the potential nutritional effect of b-carotene-
containing rice. With the use of an impressive methodology, the
authors provide some evidence for an uptake of b-carotene from
rice in humans.
Given the enormous effort and elegance in the scientific methods
used the study, however, the study fail to provide significant data
for the evidence of a nutritional benefit from Golden Rice because
