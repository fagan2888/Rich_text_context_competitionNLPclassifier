Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome­associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was introduced to the United
States through air travel. Although the risk of SARS-CoV transmission within aircraft cabins has been addressed by
several studies, the magnitude of the risk remains unclear.
Methods. We attempted to contact all persons with working US telephone numbers aboard seven US-bound flights
carrying SARS patients. Consenting participants responded to a questionnaire, and a serum sample was collected
at least 38 days after the flight and tested for SARS-CoV-associated antibodies. Participants reporting an illness
compatible with SARS, with onset during the 2- to 10-day incubation period, were considered suspect cases; positive
serology was required for confirmed cases.
Results. Among 1,766 passengers and crew, 339 (19%) persons were contacted. Of these, 312 (92%) completed ques-
tionnaires, and blood was collected from 127 (37%). Serology was negative for all 127 participants, including three of
four who met the clinical case criteria for SARS, and the fourth had a mild illness that lasted only 5 days.
Conclusions. Transmission of SARS-associated CoV was not observed, suggesting that the risk of transmission is not
amplified aboard aircraft.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a
new disease caused by a novel SARS coronavirus
(SARS-CoV).1,2 It is characterized by fever and re-
spiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of
breath3 and is fatal in about 10% of cases.4 The virus
is thought to be transmitted from person to person,
primarily through large respiratory droplets.5
ThefirstSARScasesappearedinSouthernChina
in November 2002.6 By July 2003, when the out-
break was considered over, 8,096 probable cases,
including 774 deaths, had been reported from 29
countries.4 In the United States, 72 probable cases
were identified, only 8 of which were laboratory
confirmed as SARS-CoV infections.6
Public concern that the environment in aircraft
cabinscouldenhanceSARS-CoVtransmissionmay
have contributed to decreased air travel during the
outbreak.7 Although several reports have been pub-
lished on possible SARS-CoV transmission aboard
aircraft,8­11 theriskoftransmissionremainsunclear.
To assess the risk of in-flight SARS-CoV transmis-
sion, we conducted an investigation of passengers
and crew aboard US-bound aircraft carrying pas-
sengers with SARS-CoV infection who were ill
within 1 week of the flight.
Methods
The five index patients included in this evaluation
became ill in February or March 2003 after travel-
ing to a SARS-affected region (Table1). Four index
patients were laboratory-confirmed to have SARS-
CoV infection. The fifth patient (Patient B) was the

died of probable SARS before specimens could be

tients (patients A, C, and D) experienced symptoms
during a total of five flights; two of these patients
(patients A and D) were coughing on a total of three
flights. One patient (patient B) became ill 2 days
after the flight.12 The onset date for the final patient
(patient E) is unclear, as mild symptoms appeared 3
days before the flight, resolved 1 day after they
appeared, and then reappeared 1 week after the
flight. For two of the patients (patients B and E),
there was evidence of secondary transmission.12
Each of seven flights carried one index patient.

Hong Kong and Taiwan began experiencing SARS
outbreaks in February and March 2003, respec-
tively.6,13 Flight durations were more than 12 hours
and less than 2 hours for international and domestic
flights, respectively.
All passengers listed on the flight manifests and
crew members who were aboard the selected flights
were eligible to participate in the study. Addition-
ally, participants were required to have working US
telephone numbers and to speak English or a lan-
guage spoken by one of our translators (Mandarin,
Cantonese, Korean, and Spanish). Flight manifests,
which included passenger names and seat assign-
ments, were requested from the airlines. Reserva-
tions records, frequent flyer data, and crew
employment records, all of which included limited
contact information, were also requested from the
airlines. For international flights, customs declara-
tions were obtained from US Customs and Border
Protection, Department of Homeland Security.

staff attempted to locate US telephone numbers for
passengers and crew when this information was not
provided or was incorrect.
This investigation was conducted as part of the
public health response to the SARS outbreak. In-
formed consent was obtained from participants be-
fore epidemiologic and clinical information, and
blood specimens were collected. Staff from either
CDCorstateorlocalhealthdepartmentscontacted
passengers and crew by telephone and asked them
to complete a standardized, interviewer-adminis-
tered questionnaire, inquiring about demograph-
ics, potential SARS-CoV exposures, and SARS-
compatible symptoms experienced within 10 days
of the flight. If participants consented to have blood
drawn for SARS-CoV testing, arrangements were
made for a home visit to occur ³38 days after the
flight (28 days after the maximum 10-day incuba-
tion period).14 Sera were sent to CDC and tested for
SARS-CoV antibodies by enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent
antibody test.2
Our case definition was based on the SARS case
definition established by CDC.14 Participants with
an illness that met the clinical criteria [fever >38°C
plus cough or shortness of breath 2 to 10 days after
the flight (the SARS incubation period)] and who
were laboratory confirmed to have detectable
SARS-CoVantibody³38daysaftertheflightwould
be considered confirmed cases of SARS. If clinical
criteria were met but serologic status was unknown
or inconclusive, the participant would be consid-
ered a suspect case patient. All participants without
detectable SARS-CoV antibodies would be consid-
ered noncases, regardless of symptoms.
Results
Flight manifests demonstrated that a total of 1,766
passengers and crew members were aboard the
seven flights; working US telephone numbers en-
abled us to contact 339 (19%) persons (Table 1). Of
thosecontacted,aninterviewwascompletedfor312
(92%), and blood was drawn from 127 (37%) for se-
rologictesting.Interviewswereconductedamedian
of 75 days after the flight (range 45­214 days), and
bloodwasdrawnamedianof124daysaftertheflight
(range 58­279 days). Among 1,082 passengers
aboard international flights who completed a cus-
toms declaration form, 552 (51%) were not US resi-
dents and were, therefore, not likely to have US
telephone numbers. Of the 208 passengers who
were seated within three rows (to the front and rear)
of the index patient, 39 were interviewed partici-
pants and 12 were serologically tested. Fifteen par-
ticipants were seated within three rows of an index
patient who was coughing during the flight. Four of
the 12 interviewed crew members reported working
in the same section as the ill patient.
Serumsampleswerecollectedfrom127(41%)of
the 312 participants and tested for SARS-CoV anti-
bodies; all the samples were negative (Table 2). One
or more potential SARS symptoms were reported
by 17 participants, 8 (47%) of whom provided sam-
ples for testing and had no detectable SARS-CoV
antibodies. Four of these participants reported a
combination of symptoms that met the clinical cri-
teria for SARS. However, three were tested and had
no detectable SARS-CoV antibodies. The fourth
was an adolescent whose parents did not consent to
having a blood sample drawn. Other than being

seated three rows in front of the index patient on a
domestic flight, she had no known exposures to
SARS patients and had never traveled to any SARS-
affected regions. Her illness was mild and resolved
after 5 days.
To assess the randomness of participant distri-
bution throughout the aircraft cabins, a nearest
neighbor analysis15 was performed. Results did not
demonstrate significant geographic clustering of
participants (p > 0.05) in any of the flights. In addi-
tion, analyses were performed to address concerns
that this investigation had insufficient power to
detect SARS-CoV transmission aboard aircraft.
Using the Poisson distribution, we calculated a
hypothetical attack rate, given our sample size of
127 (the total number of participants with serologic
results), an alpha of 0.05, and a beta of 0.2. We de-
termined that the probability of observing zero
cases was consistent with an attack rate of less than
3%.Ifthetruerateoftransmissionaboardaircraftis
greater than 3%, then there would have been a 95%
probability of finding at least one case of aircraft
exposure-related SARS among the 127 persons
tested for SARS-CoV antibodies.
Discussion
No infection resulting from transmission of SARS-
CoV was documented aboard seven commercial
flights that carried persons with SARS. Among the
312 passengers and crew interviewed and the 127
whose serum samples were tested, 4 met the clinical
case criteria but 3 were found to be negative for
SARS-CoV antibodies and did not meet the SARS
clinical case definition. Because the fourth suspect
case patient did not consent to provide a blood sam-
ple, laboratory evaluation was not possible.
Other investigations that examined the risk of
SARS-CoV transmission aboard aircraft have re-
cently been published.8­11 However, we questioned
whether all reported cases truly represented in-
flight transmission because not all index patients in-
cluded in these studies had laboratory-confirmed
SARS-CoV infection. Moreover, most cases of pre-
sumed secondary transmission occurred among per-
sons who had visited SARS-affected regions within
the incubation period, leaving open the possibility
that transmission could have occurred before board-
ing the flight. For example, Olsen10 and colleagues re-
ported that 22 of 119 passengers and crew were
potentiallyinfectedduringaflightfromHongKongto
Beijing.Althoughtransmissionseemslikelytohaveoc-
curred,theindexpatientwasnotlaboratoryconfirmed
and the flight originated in a SARS-affected area.
Our finding that no confirmed cases of in-flight
transmission were identified aboard any of the seven
aircraft included in the investigation suggests that
the risk of SARS-CoV transmission is not high
aboardaircraft.However,otherexplanationsforthis
finding are possible. For example, the five index pa-
tients, all of whom were well enough to travel, may
not have been infectious during the flight, despite
thepresenceofsymptoms.Onlyoneflightcarriedan
index patient (patient A) who flew approximately 1
weekaftersymptomonsetwhenviralloadsarepeak-
ing and risk of transmission is likely increased.16­18
Even though most of the passengers and crew we
were able to contact were willing to participate, the
major weakness of our investigation was its limited
samplesize.Thelargeproportionofpassengersand
crew living outside the United States restricted the
number of eligible participants. Contact informa-
tion from the airlines was of variable quality and
incomplete since airlines typically purge reserva-
tions data 48 hours after landing.19 Customs decla-
rations, available only for international flights, are
handwritten, difficult to read, and often do not in-
clude adequate contact information. The process

of locating airline passengers for public health
purposes could be significantly improved if data
such as telephone numbers and addresses were
provided from the airlines to public health agencies
rapidly and in an electronic format. Another poten-
tial weakness involves the possibility that SARS
symptoms might have been inaccurately recalled by
participants, especially if interviews took place well
after the flight occurred. However, because SARS
symptoms are generally quite severe, we feel that
inaccurate recall is unlikely to have caused us to miss
a case.
SARS-CoVcouldpotentiallybetransmittedany-
wherepeoplearegathered,includingaircraftcabins.
However, the relevant question is whether the air-
craft cabin environment leads to a higher risk of
transmission. Although our sample size was limited,
our findings suggest that risk of SARS-CoV trans-
mission is not high aboard aircraft, even among pas-
sengers seated near the index patient on long flights.
The probability of transmission is more likely to be
determined by the infectiousness of the index pa-
tient rather than the physical setting (eg, aircraft,
classroom, or hospital). Thus, prevention efforts for
air travel should continue to focus on reducing in-
fectiousparticlesonaircraftbydiscouragingpersons
who are acutely ill from traveling and reminding
passengers to wash their hands frequently and cover
their noses and mouths when coughing or sneezing.
