Developing countries are clearly facing a double burden
of disease. The prevalences of overweight and obesity are
rising among adults simultaneously with high rates of
undernutrition among children1 足7. Consequently, nutri-
tion-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular
disease and diabetes, are emerging as concerns in
developing countries8. These concerns are combined
with the continued need to address undernutrition and
infectious disease. Overweight and obesity are increasing
in Chile among low-income groups and poor commu-
nities9. There is a triple burden of disease in South Africa,
described by Vorster10. These are poverty-related infec-
tious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, violence-related
injuries and an increase in lifestyle-related non-commu-
nicable diseases. The burden of obesity and cardiovas-
cular disease in the more developed regions of Brazil is
also emerging among the poor11. As nutrition-related
chronic diseases become more prevalent, limited
resources will be further strained by the simultaneous
cost of addressing infectious disease and undernutrition,
while treating nutrition-related chronic diseases. Early
prevention is essential in order to prevent the epidemic. As
Reddy8 states in this supplement, prevention is a
necessary, cost-effective means of avoiding the high
social, biological and economic costs of a treatment-based
approach to nutrition-related chronic diseases. Thus, as a
part of this meeting, we considered programmes in
developing countries that have sought to intervene early
to prevent obesity and nutrition-related chronic diseases.
Participants
There are few examples of large-scale interventions that
focus on diet and activity patterns related to nutrition-
related chronic diseases in developing countries. There-
fore, we queried the participants of the meeting for
examples from their countries (Brazil, Chile, China, Cuba,
Egypt, India, Iran, South Africa, South Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, Morocco, Thailand and Tanzania) of large-scale
programmes to prevent obesity to change sedentary
behaviours, or to address diet as related to chronic disease.
This is the focus of this summary paper. Interventions and
programmes related to undernutrition are not included.
Only a few pilot projects that will eventually become
larger-scale interventions and innovative, smaller studies
are included. Since limitations of space preclude a
comprehensive report, we summarise the key results.
Large-scale and monitoring programmes
Assessment of the extent of overweight, obesity and
nutrition-related chronic diseases is critical to addressing
the problem. Therefore, we first consider whether the
countries represented in this meeting have established or
are establishing large-scale programmes and/or monitor-
ing systems. Monitoring systems include diachronic,
nationally representative surveys that assess the preva-
lence of overweight, obesity or nutrition-related chronic
diseases. A large-scale monitoring system is being built in
Brazil. Chile, China, Cuba, Iran, India, South Africa, South
Korea and Thailand have large-scale monitoring systems
in place. There is a large-scale monitoring system in
Morocco specifically for cardiovascular disease. The
remaining countries 足 Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico and
Tanzania 足 either have large-scale cross-sectional surveys
that are not monitoring systems, or monitoring is through
small surveys often related to research.
School programmes
Next we considered large-scale interventions or pro-
grammes oriented towards obesity and nutrition-related
chronic diseases. Eight of the 14 countries represented
have large-scale school-based interventions or pro-
grammes. Brazil has recently included, in the national
school meals programme, the requirement that 70% of the
foods be basic foods or minimally processed foods.
Chile has included more fruits and vegetables in the
national school meals programme and is developing
education programmes on nutrition and physical activity
in schools. There is also a growing `healthy schools'
initiative focused on nutrition, physical activity, smoking
cessation, environment and psychosocial risk factors that
currently include more than 1000 schools. As described by
Zhai et al.12 in this supplement, the Ministry of Education
in China has asked schools to increase time for physical
activity. There have been large-scale nutrition education
programmes in the schools in South Korea and dietitians
are involved in the school meals programme. There is a
multi-centre nutrition education programme in Malaysia.

This is a research-oriented programme, and when
completed, may provide insight into the effectiveness of
such programmes. Pilot interventions in Mexico have been
initiated to address child obesity, the goal of which is to
increase physical activity and to promote knowledge of
nutrition among children. There is a `healthy schools'
initiative in South Africa that includes a focus on obesity
and nutrition-related chronic disease prevention. Finally, a
school-based programme began in Thailand in September
2001. This programme, in regional primary and secondary
schools, focuses on physical activity and a healthy diet.
Workplace programmes
Whereas schools are a convenient means of reaching
children, the workplace is ideal for interventions reaching
adults. It is not surprising to find that five countries have
large-scale interventions or screening programmes at
work sites because adults are the first group to be affected
by nutrition-related chronic diseases. The healthcare
system in Cuba for the prevention of nutrition-related
non-communicable diseases has been extended to the
workplace. Work sites in Chile are used for screening risk
factors for non-communicable diseases. A large-scale
intervention in India at multiple work sites incorporates
exercise, changes in the cafeteria menus and family
nutrition counselling. South Korea also has large-scale
interventions or screening programmes at work sites that
include regular health examinations as well as health and
nutrition education and counselling. The promotion of
physical activity in Thailand in the workplace is among the
strategies of health promotion in the National Plan,
although implementation of this varies by region. On a
smaller scale, there are selected work site programmes in
Tanzania that focus on exercise.
Community-oriented programmes
Although school-based and work site programmes target
large numbers of individuals, seven countries have large-
scale studies focusing at the community level. There is a
large-scale, multi-level, community-wide intervention in
Brazil promoting physical activity through culturally
appropriate means. This programme, known as Agita, is
described in detail in this supplement by Matsudo et al.13.
Within Brazil the programme is being extended to other
communities, and the image and messages are adapted to
make it culturally appropriate. In their paper focusing on
Chile, Albala et al.9 describe the health promotion policy.
This policy focuses on food, nutrition, physical activity and
other risk factors for nutrition-related chronic diseases in
an integrated way at the county and small community
level. There are large-scale community education and
health promotion programmes in China to reduce
hypertension. Large-scale community programmes in
Cuba promote physical activity, diet change and education
for the prevention of nutrition-related chronic diseases.
Health promotion related to nutrition-related chronic
diseases in Mexico is in progress. In South Korea, nutrition
and health services are available through the nation-wide
community health centres. Dietitians have further sup-
ported the nutrition services of 32 test community health
centres. This programme is expected to be expanded
nation-wide. Finally, community programmes in Thailand
focus on physical fitness and healthy eating for the elderly.
With the exception of Thailand, which focuses on the
elderly, these community interventions generally reach
individuals of all ages.
Other programmes
Other large-scale interventions and programmes are good
examples of the types of intervention that can be emulated
elsewhere. There is an annual healthy lifestyle campaign
in Malaysia. Although the specific focus changes each year,
this event has included a focus on lifestyle related to
nutrition-related chronic diseases. Such programmes
increase awareness of non-communicable disease and
related lifestyles, such as physical activity and diet.
National campaigns in Thailand for nutrition-related
chronic disease prevention focus on screening and
management of nutrition-related chronic diseases such
as hypertension and diabetes. All levels of the national
healthcare system in Cuba address non-communicable
diseases, including both prevention and control. A large-
scale initiative related to diabetes prevention in Iran
includes screening, intervention, control and education. In
the north-west province of South Africa, an intervention
among farm dwellers seeks to bring both overweight and
underweight individuals to optimal health. This type of
programme is innovative and unique, and is an example of
the kind of programme needed in communities facing
both kinds of malnutrition. Another intervention in South
Africa is a television soap opera series called Soul City.
This programme targets low-income groups and includes
health messages addressing both undernutrition and
overweight, with a sister radio programme for those
without access to television. Finally, the National Health
Promotion Act of 1995 in South Korea included a call for
diet and activity interventions to address nutrition-related
chronic diseases and obesity prevention. Furthermore,
nutrition specialists in South Korea have encouraged and
promoted the traditional diet, which is low in fat and high
in vegetables14,15. As described by Lee et al.15 in this
supplement, the consumption of local foods and
agricultural products was encouraged to protect local
farming. The government actively conserved the tra-
ditional diet through training housewives to cook the
traditional cuisine14. South Korea provides an example of
a country with a healthy traditional diet that was preserved
through the joint efforts of dietitians and the government.
These programmes show that innovative interventions

are addressing diet-related chronic diseases in many of the
14 countries represented at the Bellagio meeting. The pro-
active policy of South Korea to preserve the healthy
traditional diet may explain why that country has not
experienced the levels of obesity and overweight that
would otherwise have been expected. The example of
Agita in Brazil provides a theoretical framework and
scientific model for interventions related to physical
activity. The South Africa farm-dwellers initiative provides
an example of a programme that addresses both under-
nutrition and overweight simultaneously. However, many
countries have only recently become aware of nutrition-
related chronic diseases as a problem. In these countries,
there is the potential to prevent sedentary behaviours and
dietary patterns related to chronic disease risk before these
behaviours become established. The most promising
programmes are those that address the needs and
concerns of the target communities using culturally
appropriate methods and messages.
