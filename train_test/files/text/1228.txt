OBJECTIVE: The frequently observed U-shaped relationship between body mass index (BMI; kg=m2) and mortality rate may be
due to the opposing effects of fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) components of BMI on mortality rate. The purpose is to test
the hypothesis stated above.
DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective cohort studies. The mortality follow-up of the first and second National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES I and NHANES II).
SUBJECTS: A total of 10 169 male subjects aged 25 ­ 75 who participated in NHANES I and II were selected for analyses. Follow-
up continued until 1992. The mean follow-up time was 14.6 y for NHANES I and 12.9 y for NHANES II. Ninety-eight percent of
the participants were successfully followed representing a total of 3722 deaths.
MEASUREMENTS: Subscapular and triceps skinfolds thickness were used as FM indicators, whereas upper arm circumference
was used as a FFM indicator. The Cox proportional hazards model tested the relationships of BMI, FM and FFM with all-cause
mortality adjusting for age, smoking status, race and education levels.
RESULTS: BMI had a U-shaped relationship with mortality, with a nadir of approximately 27 kg=m2. However, when indicators of
FM and FFM were added to the model, the relationship between BMI and mortality became more nearly monotonic increasing.
Moreover, the relationship between FM indicator and mortality was monotonic increasing and the relationship between FFM
indicator and mortality was monotonic decreasing.
CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that the apparently deleterious effects of marked thinness may be due to
low FFM and that, over the observed range of the data, marked leanness (as opposed to thinness) has beneficial effects.

Introduction
It is well established that obesity is associated with increased
mortality rate.1 However, the cause of the frequently
observed U- or J-shaped relationship between body mass
index (BMI) and mortality rate remains poorly understood.2
It has been contended that the elevated mortality rate
with low BMI is due to confounding by smoking and pre-
existing disease.3 While some studies support this hypoth-
esis,4,5 most studies continue to find a U- or J-shaped curve
between BMI and mortality rate even after attempting to
control for smoking and pre-existing subclinical or occult
disease.1,6 This puzzling finding seems inconsistent with the
clinical observation that weight loss improves (short-term)

health7 and experimental data that laboratory animals sub-
jected to marked caloric restriction live substantially longer
than animals fed ad libitum.8 Allison et al9 proposed an
additional explanation for the elevated mortality seen with
low BMI. Specifically, BMI was noted to be the summation of
fat mass (FM)=meters2 and fat-free mass (FFM)=meters2. To
the extent that FM and FFM have opposite effects on mor-
tality, simulation studies demonstrated that a U- or J-shaped
relationship between BMI and mortality rate could occur.9
With low BMIs, this might be due to elevated mortality due
to insufficient FFM.
Several studies offer limited information about the poten-
tial validity of the hypothesis10 ­ 12 and have generally sup-
ported the expectation that measures of adiposity have a
more nearly monotonic increasing relationship with mortal-
ity rate than do measures of total body mass or BMI. How-
ever, these studies were limited in sample size, body
composition measurements (often relying on poorly vali-
dated measures), and the thoroughness of the statistical
analysis (eg not assessing conditional effects, using inap-
propriate tests etc).
Three additional studies have addressed the relationship
between adiposity per se, BMI and mortality rate.13 ­ 15 Lee
et al16 examined associations of FM, FFM and fitness with all-
cause mortality rate at mean follow-up of 8 y in 21 925 men
in an observational study. Unfortunately, Blair et al13 did not
assess the conditional effects of FM and FFM or of FM and BMI
and therefore did not eliminate the confounding among
these measures that may have existed due to their close
correlation. Kalmijn et al14 examined the independent asso-
ciations of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio and skinfold thickness
with all-cause mortality rate among 3741 elderly Japanese-
American men. Following subjects for a mean of 4.5 y,
investigators found inverse and direct associations of BMI
and waist-to-hip ratio, respectively, with mortality rate.
Whereas increasing BMI was associated with reduced mortal-
ity rate, increasing waist-to-hip ratio was associated with
increased mortality rate. Heitmann et al15 studied 22 y mor-
tality as a function of BMI and body fat among 787 Swedish
men followed from age 60 to 82 with body composition
assessed by total body potassium counting. Results were
consistent with those hypothesized by Allison et al.9 Speci-
fically, there was a U-shaped relationship between BMI and
mortality rate, a monotonic increasing relationship between
adiposity and mortality rate, and a monotonic decreasing
relationship between FFM and mortality rate. This study
strongly supports the hypotheses that the U-shaped relation-
ship between BMI and mortality rate may be due to the fact
that BMI is a composite of FM and FFM. However, its
relatively small sample size and the advanced age (60 ­
82 y) of the subjects suggest the importance of additional
studies in larger samples of the broader population.
To address this, we used data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) I and II,
which consist of representative samples of the US civilian
non-institutionalized population. In each survey, height,
weight, subscapular and triceps skinfolds were measured
and mortality data collected. Collectively, these data sets
yield over 10 000 adult male subjects, making this the largest
study to date to address the differential effects of adiposity
and BMI on mortality rate and the first to do so in a
nationally representative sample. We will report on women
in a separate paper given the substantial sex differences in
adiposity,17 body fat distribution,18 and mortality rate.19
Methods
Study sample
Subjects were from two sources: the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey I (NHANES I), and the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II
(NHANES II). NHANES I and II were multi-purpose cross-
sectional surveys of the civilian non-institutionalized popu-
lation of the US conducted from 1971 to 1980 by the
National Center for Health Statistics using a stratified
multi-stage clustered probability sampling design. Details
about these two surveys are well described elsewhere.20 ­ 23
In the present study we restricted analyses to male subjects
aged 25 ­ 75 y in NHANES I (5820 NHANES I) and those aged
30 ­ 75 y in NHANES II (4349 NHANES II). The vital status
follow-up was conducted and all-cause mortality data were
compiled in 1992 for both NHANES I and II, which consisted
of 2464 and 1258 deaths in NHANES I and II, respectively.
Survival time from baseline to date of death was calculated.
Right-sided censoring was used for the 170 subjects lost to
follow-up.
Measures
The surveys covered many aspects relevant to health, nutri-
tion and living conditions as well as anthropometrics. The
following covariates were selected for analyses in this study:
baseline age, height, weight, triceps and subscapular skin-
folds, arm circumference, smoking status, vital status, race
and education level. Height, weight and anthropometric
measurements using a standardized protocol were performed
in both NHANES I and NHANES II.22,23 The smoking variable
was defined as current, unknown and never smokers. Race
was categorized as white, black and other. Education level
was divided into three categories, ie attaining less than 8 y of
education, 8 ­ 12 y, and more than 12 y. BMI was calculated
as kg=m2. The operational definition of fat mass indicator
(FMI) is the sum of the Z-score of triceps skinfolds thickness
and the Z-score of subscapular skinfolds thickness. Z-score
was defined as a deviation from the sample mean value in
sample standard deviation units. The upper arm circumfer-
ence was used as a fat-free mass indicator (FFMI). Although
the upper arm circumference includes muscle, bone and
adipose tissue, ie it is a composite of FM and FFM, in the
presence of FM indicators in the same model, ie conditional
on FM indicators, upper arm circumference should become

largely representative of fat-free arm tissue. The choice of the
prediction variables depends on the hypotheses to be tested.
Statistical analysis
We used Cox proportional hazards model for the survival
analysis. Statistical comparisons of baseline characteristics of
subjects between NHANES I and II were made by the w2 test
and Student's t-test. All analyses used SAS statistical software
(SAS version 7, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Two-tailed
(a ¼ 0.05) tests of significance were used.
Outcome variable. Time from baseline to all-cause death
and right censoring for 170 subjects with unknown vital
status in NHANES I were used as the endpoint. Subjects
dying early were not excluded for reasons discussed else-
where.24 ­ 26
Prediction variables. BMI, FMI, FFMI, BMI2 and FMI2.
Main covariates. Age, cohort (NHANES I vs II) and
smoking status. These covariates were always included in
modeling.
Sensitivity covariates. Race and education level. These
covariates were added to the main models below to assess
the sensitivity of the results.
In terms of modeling we considered four main models --
models 1, 2, 3 and 4. In model 1, the prediction variables
were BMI and BMI2 to test for the U-shaped relationships
between BMI and all-cause mortality that have been pre-
viously observed. In model 2, the prediction variables were
BMI, BMI2 and FFMI. This model was to test the hypotheses
of decreasing (ie protective) effect of FFMI on all-cause
mortality rate in the presence of BMI and BMI2. Model 3
tested the hypotheses of increasing (ie harmful) effect of FMI
and decreasing (ie protective) effect of FFMI on all-cause
mortality rate conditional on a given BMI. Model 4 tested
the shape of the relationship between FMI and all-cause
mortality by adding FMI2 into model 3. Sensitivity analyses
were followed by adding the `sensitivity covariates' above in
four models.
Results
Descriptive statistics
The baseline characteristics of subjects who participated in
NHANES I and II are shown in Table 1. There was a statisti-
cally significant difference in age between the two cohorts.
Weight, BMI, subscapular and triceps skinfolds were greater
for participants in NHANES II compared to NHANES I;
however there was no statistically significant difference in
height or arm circumference. There were also statistically
significant differences in mean survival time, smoking status,
vital status (including number of all-cause deaths), race and
educational levels between NHANES I and II.
The correlations among BMI, FMI and FFMI are shown in
Table 2. The correlation coefficient was highest between BMI
and FFMI and lowest between FMI and FFMI.
Primary analyses
Table 3 shows the hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality
for each of the four Cox proportional models performed. In
model 1, there was a significant U-shaped relationship
between BMI and all-cause mortality after adjusting for
age, smoking status and cohort, but without adjusting for
FMI and FFMI. The estimated nadir of the BMI curve was
27.3 kg=m2. After adding FFMI into the model (model 2), the
U-shaped relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality

remained significant, but the nadir of BMI was reduced to
19.5 kg=m2 which corresponds to the 4.7th percentile in
NHANES I and II combined. FFMI showed a significantly
negative (ie protective) relationship with all-cause mortality
rate (HR ¼ 0.928, 95% CI 0.911, 0.945, P < 0.0001). Figure 1
illustrates these relationships by plotting the hazard ratios
against an abscissa in Z-score units to standardize across
different the metrics of the independent variables.
In model 3, after adjusting for both FMI and FFMI, the
relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality and the
nadir of BMI were similar to model 2. In addition, there was a
positive relationship between FMI and all-cause mortality
rate (HR ¼ 1.033, 95% CI (1.005, 1.063), P ¼ 0.0213), whereas
the relationship between FFMI and all-cause mortality
remained significantly negative (ie protective; HR ¼ 0.923,
95% CI (0.906, 0.941), P < 0.0001). After adding FMI2 into
model (model 4), the relationships of FMI, FFMI and BMI
with all-cause mortality rate remained similar to the Cox
model 3. Moreover, the relationship between FMI2 and all-
cause mortality rate was not significant (HR ¼ 0.999, 95% CI
(0.993, 1.005), P ¼ 0.7744), which indicated a monotonic
increasing relationship between FMI and all-cause mortality
rate. Current smokers showed a significantly higher rate of
all-cause mortality when compared to non-smokers in all
four models.
Sensitivity analyses
As shown in Table 4, after adding race and education levels
to the models, the relationships of BMI, BMI2, FMI, FMI2,
FFMI, age, smoking status and cohort with all-cause mortal-
ity rate did not change.
When we omitted subjects those with unknown smoking
status, the results were virtually unchanged compared with
those using all subjects (data not shown).
We also evaluated the potential effect of multicollinearity
between BMI, FMI and FFMI on our results. Standard diag-
nostic tests did reveal modest multicollinearity. Although
this might have yielded larger standard errors, the parameter
estimates remain unbiased. Furthermore, given that the key
estimates were generally statistically significant, the multi-
collinearity did not seem to eliminate our ability to draw
reasonably confident conclusions from our results. This was
confirmed with sensitivity analysis where two orthogonal

principal component scores representing `FM' and `FFM'
were added to the Cox models. These models yielded similar
results: all-cause mortality decreased with FFMI and
increased with FMI, suggesting multicollinearity contributed
negligibly to these analyses.
Discussion
In this study, we observed that the relationship between BMI
and all-cause mortality was U-shaped with the nadir of BMI
being approximately 27 kg=m2. However, after adjusting for
FFMI alone or together with FMI, the nadir decreased to 19.5
and 20.5 kg=m2, respectively. Moreover, unlike BMI, FMI
tended to be monotonically increasing with respect to mor-
tality rate, whereas the association between all-cause mor-
tality rate and FFMI was monotonically decreasing. These
results are consistent with other studies,9 which have
hypothesized that the consistently demonstrated U-shaped
relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality may be the
result of the inverse independent effect of FMI and FFMI on
mortality. We have shown in these analyses using crude,
surrogate indicators of FM and FFM that this hypothesis may
be valid. Whether FM and FFM can be more precisely
parceled out of BMI using more accurate and precise mea-
surements of adiposity such as dual-energy X-ray absorptio-
metry (DEXA) or magnetic resonance requires further
investigation. It should be noted that this study did not
measure changes in FM and FFM indicators in relation to
mortality, which addresses a different question. There is
reason to suspect that changes in these respective indicators
may have different associations with mortality. An analysis
of the Tecumseh Community Health Study and Framingham
Heart Study concluded that weight loss is associated with
increased mortality rate and fat loss is associated with
decreased mortality rate.27
The strengths of this present study are several-fold. Pool-
ing these nationally representative samples enhances statis-
tical power, the precision and external validity of the results.
The high-quality standardization of the anthropometric
measurements in these cohorts also minimizes measurement
error and potential biases. Additionally, the simultaneous
use of indicators of FM and FFM in the survival models
allows for the potential assessment of each effect indepen-
dent of the other.
Given the mean differences that exist between the two
cohorts utilized in terms of baseline body mass indicators, it
is reasonable to inquire how this might have affected results.
Significant differences (in means) of variables between the
two cohorts will not affect the estimated effects of the
independent variables when data from the two cohorts are
pooled together, if a term for cohort is included in the model
as we did and there is no interaction between cohort and the
independent variables. Although not reported in detail,
those interactions were tested and found not to be statisti-
cally significant. Therefore, for this particular study, the
significant differences in means do not seem to influence

the results. Therefore, pooling these two nationally repre-
sentative samples seems well justified.
The present study demonstrated a differential association
of BMI and adiposity with all-cause mortality rate. These
results, in conjunction with recent reports,13 ­ 15 should sti-
mulate use of more rigorous body composition measure-
ments in epidemiologic studies. Additionally, and perhaps
most importantly, these studies may have implications for
the development of clinical and public health guidelines
pertaining to the weight and body composition associated
with optimal health.28
The results of this study, however, should be interpreted
taking into account several study limitations. Although the
inclusion of skinfold measurements expands the underlying
role of BMI on all-cause mortality, estimates of FM using
these measurements are not optimal.29 Newer methods such
as DEXA, for example, provide more accurate estimates of
total body fat29,30 and would be preferable. However, these
methods are relatively expensive and may be difficult to use
in large-scale epidemiologic research. Until such studies are
available, the anthropometric measurements may offer safe,
inexpensive and practical proxies of subcutaneous fat.31
This study did not have measurements of regional adip-
osity. Waist circumference, for example, as a measure of
visceral adiposity, has been shown to be more strongly
associated with obesity-related comorbidities and mortality
rate than subcutaneous adiposity.32,33 Additionally, intra-
abdominal FM measured by magnetic resonance or com-
puted tomography imaging techniques may more accurately
measure visceral FM.34
Since this was an observational study, causal pathways
underlying the observed associations cannot be inferred with
confidence. We cannot rule out the possibility, for example,
that underlying wasting disease partially accounted for the
relationship between FFM and mortality rate. We believe our
findings here are provocative and future studies should
replicate these finding using more accurate body composi-
tion measurements. Future studies using NHANES III and IV
data are expected to provide more precise answers to the
research questions posed herein. NHANES III made use of
bioimpedance analysis and, to our knowledge, NHANES IV
will make use of DEXA. Finally, despite the practical chal-
lenges, studies making use of regional adiposity may yield
novel insights into true body composition ­ mortality
relationships.
