Special Issue - Student Diversity
The belief that gifted students can be successful on their own
is nowadays currently considered more a myth rather than an
evidence-based claim (Bain, Bliss, Choate, & Brown, 2007).
Gifted students often require support to reach their potential.
Fortunately, several types of programs for gifted students
have been implemented in different countries, and teachers
have received preparation to address their needs.
However, preparation is not always good enough and
teachers are not equipped to face the needs of gifted students
in different contexts; this preparation is particularly deficient
in contending with the cultural and/or socio-economic differ-
ences gifted students might bring (Kaplan, 2012). Because
each context is different, there is no certainty that any given
approach to teaching will have the desired impact on stu-
dents (Timperley, Wilson, Barrar, & Fung, 2007). In the
words of Darling-Hammond and Snyder (2000), "formulas
for teaching that do not take account of students'experiences
and needs are less and less successful" (p. 523). In the litera-
ture of giftedness, a large body of research exists concerning
the characteristics and competencies of teachers for the
gifted (Hansen & Feldhusen, 1994), and diverse teaching
models also have been created to meet this population's
needs (Maker & Schiever, 2005). However, these models put
an emphasis on the "shoulds" regarding the instruction pro-
vided for gifted students (Hertzog, 1998). The main actors in
this process--students, teachers, and administrators--are
not always consulted about their experiences and what mat-
ters to them in the teaching and learning process. Without the
views of all of the community, including students, the picture
of the educational process is incomplete (Cook-Sather,
2002). Some researchers have found that the school systems
and teachers can benefit greatly by listening to the unique
perspectives of members of the school community,

How Good Is Good Enough? A
Community-Based Assessment of
Teacher Competencies for Gifted
Students

Abstract
One of the major challenges of addressing diversity in the classroom is to meet the needs of gifted students, which are
often invisible in countries such as Chile, in which providing services for highly able students is still considered elitist. The
purpose of this study was to analyze the perceptions of community members about the critical competencies of instructors
who work with gifted students. Six focus groups were conducted with students, instructors, and staff members of an
enrichment program for the gifted. Qualitative analyses were conducted throughout open, axial, and selective coding. Traits
and competencies were grouped into three themes: knowledge, teaching, and socio-emotional characteristics. Differences
were found between the perceptions of students and staff members: Whereas students' emphasis was on socio-affective
characteristics, the staff highlighted the importance of content and pedagogical knowledge. The novelty and contribution of
the study are related on how to recognize and acknowledge the voices of active members of a community for educational
improvement. These community perceptions contributed to depict a profile of an effective teacher for gifted students, and
were used to improve instructors' current performance and to design a more rigorous selection process for future teachers.
The implications of the study also shed light about how to improve teacher preparation programs to meet the needs of this
group of students.

especially students, who can be effective informants of their
educational process (Mitra, 2004).
The purpose of this study was to incorporate the voices
of various members of a learning community, not only as
primary informants of their teaching and learning experi-
ences but also as individuals who have an active role in
this community, whose perceptions matter, and can, there-
fore, exert a direct influence on the educational and admin-
istrative levels and become partners in decision-making
processes. The goal was to complement the existing dia-
logue on teacher competencies for the gifted by consider-
ing the viewpoints of all the participants through enquiry
(Schultz, 2012), to include the voices of gifted individuals
and educators into the gifted education discourse
(Mendaglio, 2003). Thus, the significance of the study was
to incorporate an important piece to the discussion of
teacher competencies: the voices of those community
members who actively participate in programs for the
gifted.
Background
Gifted Students as Learners
Gifted students differ in the type and level of their abilities
(Feldhusen, 1982), and they do not share the same learning
characteristics (Hertzog, 1998). However, compared with
their non-gifted peers, they do present unique learning needs
that cannot be disregarded (Stepanek, 1999), and researchers
have found significant differences between the learning
styles of these two groups of students (Kahyaoglu, 2013).
Gifted students' learning needs. Learning styles and personal-
ity traits of gifted students, taken as a whole, tend to display
certain characteristics that identify these students (Thomson,
2010). Kerry (1983) proposed grouping these needs into
three categories: cognitive (related to several complex cogni-
tive processes), social (relationships), and affective (intrap-
ersonal preferences).
Cognitive. Researchers who conducted longitudinal stud-
ies have found that gifted students have a tendency to estab-
lish complex relationships between ideas; to enjoy theory,
such as abstract concepts; to be more open and flexible; and
to gravitate toward logical analysis and objectivity (Mills,
2003; Oakland, Joyce, Horton, & Glutting, 2000). Dunn,
Dunn, and Price (1989) found certain unique traits among
these students, such as feeling responsible about their own
learning, preferring kinesthetic learning, having a preference
for lack of structure, liking independent learning, and dis-
liking passive listening. Other researchers have found that
gifted students enjoy problem-solving activities (Gadanidis,
Hughes, & Cordy, 2011), questioning given information,
experiments, exploration, creating alternate solutions, and
generating original ideas (Johnsen, 2004).
Social.Gifted students' interactions with their immedi-
ate context are not always easy and straightforward, mainly
because they are not always accepted and feel different from
their peers. Also, due to their asynchronous development
(i.e., discrepancy between cognitive and socio-emotional
development), gifted students can be at risk of social alien-
ation (Silverman, 2002). According to Cross (1997), the
social needs that arise out of the interaction between the
gifted student and his or her environment can include feeling
they are accepted by others, being with other gifted students,
and being acknowledged for their achievements.
Affective. Several affective and personality traits of gifted
students have been investigated over the years; however, they
must be analyzed, not in isolation, but in the context of how
they relate to the students' cognitive characteristics and the
interactions with the social environment. Even though some
researchers have taken polarized stands regarding the mani-
festation and intensity of the socio-emotional needs of gifted
students, there seems to be some agreement about periods,
such as adolescence, that are critical in the socio-emotional
development of gifted students.
Successful Teachers of the Gifted
The critical role of the teacher in nurturing and addressing
gifted students'potential is undeniable, and early studies have
found that teachers do make a difference (Cropley & McLeod,
1986).According to the characteristics of gifted students, sev-
eral researchers have investigated the "ideal" competencies of
the teachers who work with this population to enhance their
learning experiences. For this research, competency will be
understood as a cluster of resources that are mobilized and
reorganized by the individual (knowledge, procedures, and
attitudes) to respond in an appropriate manner to a situation,
in a given context, which means "knowing how to act"
(Jonnaert, 2002; Le Boterf, 2002; Tardif, 2006). These teach-
ers' resources, also known in education as professional com-
petence, have been widely studied in the field of teacher
education. One of the prominent authors in this field is Lee
Shulman, who proposed a paradigm to understand teachers'
professional knowledge (Kleickmann et al., 2013; Shulman,
1986). Several authors have investigated Shulman's catego-
ries and even though there has been no agreement about the
relationship between domains, they can be grouped into four
main groups: subject matter knowledge (also known as con-
tent knowledge or CK), pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical
content knowledge (PCK), and knowledge of the context
(Park & Oliver, 2008). For this study, we particularly focused
on CK and PCK as core constructs that can be identified by
those actively participating in an educational community.
Content knowledge was defined following Shulman's (1986)
conceptualization: "the amount and organization of knowl-
edge per se in the mind of teachers" (p. 9), that is, a complete
and profound understanding of the subject matter. PCK was
Gómez-Arizaga et al. 3
understood as the extensive array of strategies employed by
teachers to promote students' understanding of a subject mat-
ter, also considering contextual limitations that can be present
in the teaching and learning process (Webb, 2013).
A teacher becomes progressively competent when
exposed to pre-service education and professional develop-
ment (Darling-Hammond, Wei, Andree, Richardson, &
Orphanos, 2009). Researchers in the field of giftedness have
found that the quality of teacher preparation is critical,
because it can transform teachers'preconceived ideas of gift-
edness (Kagan, 1992). However, several investigations have
shown that pre-service training in gifted education is insuf-
ficient (Rowley, 2012) and that in-service professional
development opportunities in the field are weak and not nec-
essarily connected to classroom implementation (VanTassel-
Baska, 2006).
Teaching practices.The discussion about teacher compe-
tences has revolved around the concept of teacher effective-
ness (Mills, 2003). Although the teachers of the gifted share
many characteristics with teachers in regular classrooms,
researchers have found that there are critical aspects that dif-
ferentiate both groups in terms of providing opportunities to
enhance students' learning experiences. Hong, Greene, and
Hartzell (2011), for example, in a comparative study of
teachers for the gifted and teachers in regular classrooms,
found significant differences between both groups: Teachers
of the gifted reported more sophisticated epistemological
beliefs regarding knowledge and learning, were more ori-
ented toward learning goals, and paid less attention to perfor-
mance goals than their peers in regular classrooms.
Furthermore, teachers of the gifted had a preference for
structure in the classroom environment and for using materi-
als that fostered student learning. However, teachers in regu-
lar classrooms were focused on the results of standardized
tests.
VanTassel-Baska (2005) found that the ideal profile of a
teacher for the gifted included competencies such as the mas-
tery of disciplinary content knowledge, a positive interaction
with students, and use of diverse teaching strategies. The
best teaching practices included a repertoire that encom-
passed student-centered teaching, use of stimulating ques-
tions, and classroom management, among others.
Teacher characteristics. In identifying effective teaching prac-
tices for gifted students, teacher competencies are not the
only factor to consider. In fact, some authors have stated that
whereas competencies can be learned or acquired throughout
teaching experiences, other characteristics are equally impor-
tant and necessary for an optimal learning process (Feldhu-
sen & Hansen, 1988). Eyre et al. (2002), in a study with
teachers from the United Kingdom, found that teachers'
insights about the needs of gifted children were relevant
when working with this population. These dispositions
included being empathetic with students' needs, having high
expectations, displaying humor, encouraging gifted students
in the same way as students in regular classrooms, ensuring
a safe classroom climate for students, and providing chal-
lenging learning experiences.
Consistent with Eyre et al., Vogl and Preckel (2014) also
found that the social environment in which learning occurs--
the classroom climate--can also be a critical component
influencing gifted students' experiences as learners. In their
study, a positive classroom climate was related to better atti-
tudes toward school and less disruptive behaviors. An ade-
quate climate also had a positive effect on gifted students'
well-being and overall satisfaction with their academic expe-
riences in schools.
Gentry, Steenbergen-Hu, and Choi (2011), in a mixed-
methods study of student-identified exemplary teachers,
found that teachers who had the most valuable competencies
had the following characteristics: had a genuine interest in
students and built strong relationships with them, set high
expectations and had high standards for their students, main-
tained a good classroom climate and had a good time with
their students, and had passion toward their teaching and
their students.
Another set of findings regarding teacher characteristics
is related to the close relationship that exists between teacher
and student characteristics. Mills (2003) found a consider-
able match between the personality types of both students
and teachers, concluding that effective teachers displayed
characteristics such as openness, flexibility, creativity, and
overall preference for intuitive processing.
Community Voice and Engagement in Assessing
Educational Practices
The concept of voice arises from the emerging need to incor-
porate different actors in understanding practices that occur
in educational settings, with the goal of empowering, incor-
porating their opinions and perceptions, and acknowledging
the importance of community voices for democratic partici-
pation in the pedagogical process (Freire, 1968). Even
though students, parents, and teachers are the main actors in
educational contexts, few investigations have taken their
voices into account, especially regarding the experiences of
teaching and learning (Budnick, 2013).
Student voice. The concept of student voice has been investi-
gated related to the forms in which students' opinions and
involvement can produce changes in the school context
(Flutter & Rudduck, 2004). In the field of giftedness, some
researchers have investigated students' views and percep-
tions of teacher quality and effectiveness. However, these
studies have been conducted exclusively for research pur-
poses and not necessarily as part of educational decision-
making processes; this was the ultimate goal of the current
investigation: incorporating student voices to foster a partici-
patory needs assessment (Wang & Burris, 1997).
4 SAGE Open
Vialle and Quigley (2002) found that students had a pref-
erence toward cognitive and socio-emotional characteristics
of teachers, such as enthusiasm, sense of humor, good com-
munication skills, and learning from errors. In other studies,
Vialle and Tischler (2009) indicated that when gifted stu-
dents are forced to make a choice about their teachers' char-
acteristics, there was a tendency to prefer personal­social
characteristics to intellectual ones. Despite these initial pref-
erences, when students answered an open-ended question,
the authors found more balance between socio-affective and
cognitive characteristics, suggesting that there is a more
complex relationship between them given that students
tended to combine both elements in their answers.
Gentry, Rizza, and Owen (2002) conducted a study with
1,250 gifted students about what teachers reported doing in
their classes and what students perceived had occurred in
them. They found discrepancies between both groups, espe-
cially regarding challenges presented by teachers. The
researchers emphasized the need to "hear both sides of the
story," which includes incorporating both teacher and stu-
dent voices to fully understand what happens within the
classroom.
J. Gallagher, Harradine, and Coleman (1997) found that
even if the students encountered some degree of challenge in
their classrooms, repetition and a slow pace were aspects that
did not favor their learning and, therefore, demanded from
their teachers more complexity, practical activities, and the
opportunity to reflect individually. Kanevsky and Keighley
(2003) found that many of the students were bored and their
perceptions of teachers and strategies were similar to the
ones found by Gallagher et al. such as repetition. When
asked about their preferences, choice appears to be a critical
aspect that enhanced the students' learning experiences.
Márquez and Martínez (2011), in a study of gifted students'
characteristics and perceptions of their educational settings,
also found that boredom was constantly mentioned by stu-
dents, who demanded better and innovative teaching prac-
tices in which they could use their time productively.
Conejeros-Solar, Gómez-Arizaga, and Donoso-Osorio
(2013), in a qualitative study on Chilean gifted students' per-
ceptions about teacher characteristics, found that (a) students
were able to conduct detailed assessments of their teachers;
(b) students' perceptions were consistent with what other
researchers have found about teacher effectiveness, such as
practicality, flexibility, and pace; and (c) students also valued
socio-emotional characteristics such as closeness, empathy,
and trust. Olivares et al. (2014) found similar results when
analyzing the perceptions of students who participated in a
Chilean enrichment program: Students had a strong prefer-
ence for interactive lessons and teaching practices that fos-
tered flexibility.
Community voice. From early research in the field, the value
of community-based approaches has been highlighted as rel-
evant to improve teaching and learning practices for gifted
students (Coutant, 1961; Pinellie, 1973; VanTassel-Baska &
Kulieke, 1987).
Matthews and Kitchen (2007) conducted a study to assess
the implementation of gifted programs within three different
schools. They found similarities between teachers and stu-
dents' responses and concluded that both of them were able
to inform about the strengths of the programs (e.g., a chal-
lenging academic environment), the changes that could be
implemented (e.g., using varied teaching methods, more pro-
fessional development for teachers), and the relationship the
programs had with the school community (e.g., a helpful
relationship).
These findings suggest that students and educators can be
a valuable resource for understanding classroom encounters
and student learning, through the analysis of their narrated
experiences. Narratives "can reveal truths of the human
experience" (Riessman, 2008, p. 10) and provide the indi-
viduals with a sense of uniqueness and purpose based on dif-
ferent experiences (Singer, 2004). In the field of gifted
education, in which a tradition of quantitative research exists,
a qualitative approach can provide richness and depth to the
discussion. Prior (2011), in her analysis of student voice in
gifted education, stated "the insider perspective is urgently
needed" (p. 125).
The purpose of this study was to recognize narratives to
produce meaningful knowledge. We investigated how a co-
constructed or community-based approach, in which the
views of students, practitioners, and teachers converge, can
help to outline a profile of characteristics and competencies
for teachers who work in an extracurricular enrichment pro-
gram for gifted students in Chile.
The question that guided the study was the following:
Research Question 1: What were the teacher competen-
cies and characteristics identified as critical by the mem-
bers of the community of an extracurricular enrichment
program for the gifted?
Method
Context
The Chilean educational system. Three types of schools can be
found in the Chilean educational system: public, semi-pri-
vate, and private. Seven of 10 students from public schools
come from the 40% of the population with the lowest socio-
economic status (SES; González, Mizala, & Romaguera,
2002). Chilean schools have a unique national curriculum
dictated by the Ministry of Education. This national curricu-
lum includes a minimum curricular content that needs to be
addressed by each school to assure that every student is pre-
pared to face high school and college demands.
Programs for the gifted.A decree promulgated in 2012
mandated the provision of special education services
Gómez-Arizaga et al. 5
within schools as compulsory. However, it did not include
services for gifted education. The only way the Chilean
Ministry of Education has secured education for the
gifted, since 2007, is through economic support for uni-
versity-based extracurricular enrichment programs that
exist in six of the 15 regions of the country. These pro-
grams serve students mainly from public schools under
the premise that this population has fewer opportunities to
develop their potential.
The BETA Program is part of the university-based pro-
gram network located in the city of Valparaíso, Chile
(Programa BETA, 2012). The program was created 10 years
ago and serves a population of approximately 270 gifted stu-
dents per year from Grades 7 to 12. Students attend the pro-
gram on Fridays and Saturdays. Each semester they have the
opportunity to choose two courses and a workshop. Courses
are focused on a specific topic of a discipline (e.g., The
Physics Behind Toys) and workshops on the mastery of a
specific skill (e.g., rock climbing).
Participants
Eighteen members of the BETA Program participated in this
study. Consent and assent for their participation was obtained
prior to the data collection process. The characteristics of the
participants are summarized in Table 1.
·
· Elementary and secondary BETA students (n = 6).
Regular BETAstudents are identified either in sixth or
ninth grade. The first step is a schoolteacher nomina-
tion; the second step is an evaluation that uses a com-
bination of different scales: the Raven Standard
Progressive Matrices and a Motivation Scale locally
elaborated. A purposeful sample of students was
drawn for the study, in which the criteria were (a) gen-
der representation, (b) active role within the program,
and (c) age representativeness (students from elemen-
tary and secondary levels were selected).
·
· Coordinators (n = 4). All the BETA coordinators par-
ticipated in the study. These are individuals who work
directly with the BETA students on tasks such as orga-
nization, research, or socio-emotional support.
·
· Members of the managerial team (n = 2). The two
members of the BETA administration team were part
of the study.All the BETAstaff were recruited through
an external hiring process, except for the director who
is nominated by the vice president of the university in
which the program is located.
·
· BETA Instructors (n = 6). A purposeful sample of
instructors was recruited to participate in the study
who met the following criteria: (a) had at least 2 years
of teaching experience in the program, (b) had good
teacher evaluations, and (c) were committed to the
program.
Parents were not included in the sample. This decision
was not arbitrary; parents can be good evaluators and their
voice was considered as part of the BETA community.
However, in the context of this study, our goal was to gather
and analyze data from those who worked and/or had direct
experiences with teachers of the BETA Program to recall
specific events or phenomena that helped explain the compe-
tencies that are critical for teaching in a program for the
gifted. This research was framed within a series of activities
organized by the BETA Program to design a community-
based teacher profile grounded in core competencies, with
the goal of recruiting future teachers that would demonstrate
the critical competencies defined by the BETA community.
Instruments and Procedures
Students, coordinators, and members of the management
team participated in separate focus group sessions. Teachers
were divided into three distinct groups: humanities, science,
and workshop instructors. A total of six focus group sessions
were conducted that had a length of approximately 1.5 to 2 hr
each. Participants were contacted and a consent form was
signed prior to the participation in the study.
Semi-structured questions focused on the characteristics
of teachers who currently work or would like to work in the
BETA Program were constructed and expert judgment was
used to validate the questions. The two protocols used had
the following characteristics: (a) questions for the student
focus group were formulated using simpler language, (b)

questions were open in nature, and (c) protocols were flexi-
ble and allowed for emergent topics to arise from partici-
pants. The questions included in both protocols are displayed
in Tables 2 and 3.
Data Analysis
Focus groups were audiotaped and data were later tran-
scribed verbatim. Transcriptions were reviewed and an ini-
tial process of open coding was conducted separately by the
two researchers using the computer-assisted qualitative data
analysis software ATLAS.ti. In this phase, each researcher
also created code and theoretical memos.
A second phase included three joint sessions of inductive
analysis (Creswell, 2007) for axial and selective coding pur-
poses to discuss the relationships among codes and to achieve
densification and saturation of the data (Glaser, 1994). In this
second phase, we focused on theory building by analyzing
patterns, building categories from those patterns, and creating
overarching themes. To ensure trustworthiness, we followed
two criteria: (a) created a thick description of the data and (b)
conducted peer-debriefing sessions during the second phase
of analysis to question and justify the categories and themes.
Results
Data analysis yielded three themes related to teachers' char-
acteristics and competencies identified by the community
members of the BETA Program. However, the connotation
and relevance of each theme was different for the group of
students and the groups of staff members and teachers, which
have been explained in detail in this section. Descriptions
and examples of the themes and subthemes that emerged
from data analyses can be found in Table 4. The three main
themes were the following:
Theme 1: Knowledge, which referred to the type and
quality of the teacher's disciplinary (subject matter)
preparation.
Theme 2: Teaching, which included the transformation of
content into teaching and learning strategies.
Theme 3: Socio-emotional characteristics represented in
student­teacher interactions.
Theme 1: Knowledge
Students did not comment on the topic of teachers' CK or
preparation; they focused on teaching strategies and socio-
emotional characteristics of their BETA instructors. On the
other side, one of the salient topics that emerged from the
BETA staff and teachers was that instructors should have a
profound knowledge of their field and be capable of acknowl-
edging the principles and problems of that field, and the con-
nection with other disciplines, as stated by one staff member:
"It is important that the instructor has a solid knowledge of
the discipline, that he is an expert in the field." Also, for this
group, teachers must know the field from a theoretical, prac-
tical, and/or experimental point of view; however, they also
have to show passion toward the discipline they teach.
You have to like what you teach, I mean, not only being the
expert, you have to like it a lot . . . It's fantastic that you can do
whatever you want and that is important, that the teacher likes
what he is doing. (BETA workshop instructor)
For the members of the management team, disciplinary
knowledge is crucial and relevant; however, the sharing of
this knowledge needs to be rigorous, considering that teach-
ers are working with gifted students who need to be chal-
lenged. The curriculum director, who is in charge of the
continuous process of following up with instructors in BETA,
stated, ". . . rigor when delivering their knowledge, when

Expertise . . . so he has to master the content knowledge, in the particular case of
mathematics, the teacher has to have a good knowledge of the field, it
cannot be a person who only has a Bachelor degree (BETA teacher).
Passion toward
content
And I also think that they have to show the passion related to the discipline
they teach (BETA staff member).
Cognitive

The teacher has to be demanding, he has to pose challenges to the students
(BETA curriculum director).
Interdisciplinary
content

That they have an interdisciplinary view of teaching, that they have an
interest in coupling with other fields (BETA science instructor).
Teaching Theoretical and
practical experience
with teaching and
learning strategies
Being flexible . . . there are teachers here that have learned how to work with gifted kids,
I mean, they have elaborated a work strategy and developed a special
attitude to work with them, because these students are very different from
university students and from the standard school student . . . the ones that
cannot adjust, that cannot learn this strategy, they leave, they don't stay in
the program (BETA coordinator).
Promoting
active student
participation
I think the teacher also needs to consider student participation, recognizing
students' previous knowledge on a topic or their opinions . . . like a
constructivist approach (staff member).
Fostering student
motivation
I took a history class that was very different in the way the teachers teach it
. . . we had to create an imaginary world applying historical facts . . . so I
was really motivated and enthusiastic about this class (secondary female
student).
Teacher
characteristics
Referred to the
psychological
characteristics that
emerge from the
socio-emotional and
pedagogical student­
teacher interactions
Empathy One of the things I consider important for being a teacher in this program is
a commitment that can be related with empathy with the work you have to
do for these students. I think that is important at a program and students
level. Beta students have different characteristics and maybe for some
teachers that could be complicated (BETA workshop teacher).
Passion Maybe in some occasions, students can ask questions that the teachers don't
know how to answer, but if you really have passion for what you do, you
can provide afterwards an adequate answer to the student (BETA socio-
emotional coordinator).
Reflection And they have to be tolerant, because here in the program the teacher is
constantly evaluated, and it is an opportunity where you see what you can
improve to be a better teacher, and you have to accept your errors, and
improve them to become a better teacher (BETA secondary student).
Interaction with
students

developing knowledge. It has to present a cognitive chal-
lenge for students. This is important, relevant."
Teachers also agreed that knowledge is relevant, espe-
cially a profound knowledge of specific content that is rele-
vant to a discipline and in which the instructor has experience
or specialization. However, the instructor needs to be able to
adapt to the students' academic backgrounds and be able to
use interdisciplinary CK, especially when students have not
had the opportunity in their school curriculum to explore cer-
tain concepts:
I think the knowledge the teacher needs to have, has to be
specific, but at the same time he needs to be able to work on
different areas, because some of the students' schools are
oriented to the social sciences. So I need to provide examples
based on my knowledge of social sciences. (BETA science
instructor)
Theme 2: Teaching
Teaching was an important element for both groups (students
and staff members). When addressing this topic, they both
referred to the term didactics, but with different connotations
and meanings: For the staff members and teachers, it was
related to instructional strategies, whereas for the students,
they used it as an adjective when referring to a teacher who
was enthusiastic and engaging. What needs to be taken into
consideration is that while students discussed their ideas,
they were always comparing their BETA instructors with
their teachers in regular classrooms. These comparisons can
8 SAGE Open
be translated into a critique of their current educational sys-
tem, which the BETA students have experienced as rigid, as
stated by a secondary student: "At school it's like the teacher
talks, the student writes, and it's like a machine, a machine
that writes . . ."
Being flexible. When students compared their BETA and reg-
ular school settings, the ideal BETA instructor is different
from their schoolteacher because the latter rigidly structures
his or her classes around the contents of the national curricu-
lum. For the students, this teacher has no room for innova-
tion because he or she is "forced" to cover specific CK. One
of the secondary students told a story about her science
teacher at her school:
She had planned her course, but they rejected it because she has
to follow what the Ministry [of Education] mandates, and she
had to do it differently. Her course had depth and was didactic
[sic], but the government said no, because it has to be the same
as in the other schools.
On the other side of the teaching spectrum, students per-
ceived that the BETA context promoted more flexibility in
their teachers. Therefore, the BETA teacher was perceived as
more enthusiastic, with more freedom to deliver specific CK,
and because it is a different context than the regular class-
room, he or she does not have the curriculum limitations that
hinder students' learning: "at my school I get bored listening
to what I already understand, but BETA is different because
they tell you different things, more in-depth things" (elemen-
tary student).
For the BETA staff, flexibility was considered as impor-
tant as disciplinary knowledge. For the managerial team, it
was particularly critical that the teachers be open to learn
about teaching strategies, because some instructors did not
have a background in education: "it is important that they
have flexibility, a desire to learn, in terms of how they can
teach in their classrooms" (BETA curriculum director).
BETA instructors saw flexibility as being able to
change direction when the development of a session is not
yielding the expected results. One science teacher warns
about "being attentive to the signals" from the students in
the classroom. Other instructors shared their narratives
about how the program and students' characteristics
required them to change their teaching practices in a posi-
tive way: from a traditional teacher-centered approach to
a student-centered one. In BETA, instructors have to be
able to move away from pre-established teaching schemes
to modify and adapt lessons according to students' needs
and preferences, favoring depth over quantity: "I'm not
saying that you are going to modify the entire syllabus,
but a topic that you had planned for one session can turn
into two sessions, into a tremendous cognitive and socio-
affective development for the students" (humanities
course instructor).
Promoting active student participation. For BETA instructors,
passive learning is not an option. Gifted students need to
have teachers who take into consideration students' prior
knowledge and opinions, so they can construct their own
perspectives on a topic and become independent learners:
"I think the teacher also needs to consider student participa-
tion, recognizing students' previous knowledge on a topic
or their opinions . . . like a constructivist approach" (staff
member).
Planning meaningful instructional activities.As stated before,
for students, BETA is a different educational setting from
school, in which there is no pressure to deliver a curriculum
and to administer standardized assessments. In this context,
the activities can be planned more freely by teachers; a valu-
able advantage for students is when instructors are able to
design activities in which they can apply the acquired knowl-
edge to have a long-lasting learning experience:
These new activities are like . . . OK, we learned the content and
now, apply it, and we do so in different ways, because the
knowledge can stay in our heads, not like in school that we study
for a test and it's gone. (Secondary student)
Also, these activities need to be varied to take into account
students' interests, as stated by one female elementary stu-
dent: "our teacher has us work in groups, sometimes we read,
and sometimes we do fun things such as drawing, writing,
we can even create our own test."
BETAinstructors and staff are aware of the fact that gifted
students are capable of solving complex problems. Therefore,
it is important for teachers to design activities in which stu-
dents are faced with different ways and strategies to address
a problem to also foster divergent thinking: "We have to let
students solve problems, and the thinking process has to be
absolutely divergent" (science instructor).
Fostering student motivation.According to students, the way
teachers approach their classes and the strategies they imple-
ment are crucial to ignite their motivation toward learning a
particular topic.
What comes to my mind is innovation, creativity, to promote
student motivation . . . because if the student is faced with
something new, he's going to say yes, he's going to be motivated
and is going to like it. On the other hand, if the teacher does
repetitive things, the student will be bored and tired, but if the
teacher has the ability to create, innovate, the student will be
motivated . . . (Secondary female student)
For the students, as well as for the staff and instructors,
helping students motivate themselves is a reflection of the
teachers' own motivation toward the student and the content
in which they have specialized: "The BETA teacher has to
motivate the student . . . the same motivation that the teacher
Gómez-Arizaga et al. 9
has, double it, and tell the student you are good at this, this is
going to help you a lot in the future" (secondary student).
For the BETA staff, the instructor who is going to teach in
the program needs to have an initial motivation toward gifted
education, and ideally, this motivation is sustained over time.
They explained that historically, BETA instructors who were
not motivated have abandoned the program: "it is a very spe-
cific field, and he or she has to be motivated, interested,
wanting to become a professional who knows about this
field," said the BETA director, reinforcing this idea.
Theme 3: Socio-Emotional Characteristics
Even though the students' discussion included different
teacher competencies, students were particularly focused on
teachers' socio-emotional characteristics. They do not see
the teacher as merely delivering content, but as someone
who can make a difference and have a positive impact in
their lives. Socio-emotional characteristics were discussed
by the BETA teachers and staff but did not have the promi-
nence and the same significance they had for the students of
the program.
Empathy.As conceptualized by students, empathetic teach-
ers not only are capable of relating to the emotions expressed
by their students when facing difficult situations but also
know how to treat students, acknowledging their back-
grounds, their abilities, and their different ways of thinking,
as stated by one male student: "I think that they need to have
empathy, they have to be responsible for the topics they are
going to address, because for example, there are students
with different religious beliefs." Empathy, in the interaction
with the student, is translated into a profound sense of respect
toward the student as an individual: "He has to be tolerant, I
think, respectful of students' ideas even if he doesn't share
them . . ." (elementary student). For the instructors, empathy
also can be translated into respect. One of the workshop
instructors narrated about how, throughout time, he encour-
aged his students to call him by his first name, and how stu-
dents developed a relationship with him based on trust and
acceptance: "the teacher needs to have a certain empathy, to
encourage student development and accept their different
realities."
Closeness.For students, closeness is narrowly related to
empathy and has three important dimensions: cognitive,
affective, and physical. Cognitive closeness gives the oppor-
tunity to debate and discuss ideas that are interesting for both
the student and the teacher: "Here [in BETA] you can have a
debate with your teacher because you know you can reach
closeness . . ." (secondary male student). Affective closeness
had to do with caring for the student beyond what happens
within the classroom, for example, showing interest in their
personal experiences and stories: "Because despite him
being your teacher, you can always talk to him. He is like a
person who is very close to you" (secondary student). Finally,
physical closeness was related to the teacher being physi-
cally available for the student and not "running away" when
the session ends. Students understood this proximity with
their teachers not as friendship, but as a person you can count
on and someone who can also learn from the student: "In
BETA, teachers leave the class to buy something and you can
talk to them . . . in schools they leave and you can't reach
them" (elementary student).
For BETA instructors, closeness was understood as
teachers' positive disposition toward their students: being
available when they approach and developing relationships
that are based on trust. One mathematics teacher stated, "it
means generating trust in the student, not only in her abili-
ties, but also that the student can initiate a conversation with
me, so I can make a contribution . . ." For the BETA staff,
closeness was also important, but they also emphasized
boundaries, because as students are out of the school con-
text, the limits of the teacher­student relationship might be
obscured: "it is important that the teacher can establish
closeness, but there are limits. It is very important for me
that the person has an emotional maturity . . . that has to be
present" (BETA director).
Passion.Students from the program, when referring to
teacher characteristics, return to comparing their teachers in
regular classrooms with the profile of the BETAteacher. This
time, they see the schoolteacher as someone who has lost his
or her enthusiasm toward teaching and is, therefore, monoto-
nous and repetitive; whereas, BETA teachers tend to love
what they do: "Teachers in school teach with a bad attitude,
but in BETA the teacher is here because he likes it, he loves
it, so he teaches us with passion, with enthusiasm" (second-
ary student).
For the BETA staff, passion is translated into a permanent
interest toward the discipline and this characteristic needs to
be evident to students, in a way that they are filled with their
teachers' enthusiasm. For the BETA director, this passion is
displayed by the instructor who is an ongoing learner: "a per-
manent researcher who is always concerned about learning
more about his discipline."
Reflection. This domain, from the instructors and staff mem-
bers' perspectives, was related to teachers' ability to reflect
on his or her own teaching, listen to other peers or colleagues,
and make adaptations if necessary. One humanities instructor
recounted her experience about reflecting on her own teach-
ing practice, as she transitioned from being extremely
teacher-centered to noticing that her students were bored,
which motivated a desire for change: "I am wrong, I need to
change, I can't continue this way . . . and I started to teach
differently, more interactively, and the students woke up and
participated in my class." For the staff members, highly val-
ued teachers were those who were self-critical and willing to
learn from feedback: "The ability to be self-critical and to be
10 SAGE Open
also open to external criticism, from informal feedback to a
more formal evaluation . . . that should be part of the teach-
ers' professional growth."
Students, who again made comparisons with their school-
teachers, considered that teachers are so concerned with the
curriculum that they are afraid of making mistakes.Therefore,
they adhere to the textbook and do not make room for reflec-
tion or innovation. For the students, an ideal characteristic of
BETA instructors is for them to acknowledge their mistakes
and improve their teaching, avoiding stagnation: "if she is
wrong, she has to know why, and then improve afterwards . .
. and not do it again" (elementary student).Also, they consid-
ered the process of teacher evaluation that occurs in BETA as
an opportunity for the teacher to improve:
We do teacher evaluations, and the teacher can see how he can
improve. They have to accept their mistakes . . . the idea is not
that they feel that they messed-up, that they are bad teachers, but
to improve and become a better teacher. (Secondary student)
Interaction with students.This domain involved the genera-
tion of an adequate socio-emotional classroom climate, in
which the instructor shows an interest toward students'needs
and characteristics, as stated by the BETA director: "Another
element that I consider important for a teacher to have is a
genuine interest in contributing to his or her students' devel-
opment." In this climate, the teacher also displays behaviors
of assertive communication, conflict resolution, leadership,
cordiality, and openness.
For all the participant groups, one key aspect was creat-
ing an environment for dialogue within the classroom in
which respect was essential: "To create opportunities for
dialogue within the classroom, to learn to listen to what the
student has to say, to show respect, to generate a climate of
trust and communication" (science instructor). For the stu-
dents, this environment is helpful to their learning, but the
teacher needs to encourage the participation of all students:
"that the teacher helps the student to get out of his capsule
and invites him to participate in the discussion" (secondary
student).
Discussion
The results of this study constitute an attempt to answer the
question about teachers for gifted students posited in the
title: How good is good enough? The participants responded
in different ways, according to their experiences as learners,
instructors, and staff members of an enrichment program for
the gifted. For students, there seems to be a match between
their unique characteristics as gifted individuals and the
expectations they have for their teachers (Mills, 2003), which
includes not only PCK competencies but also a set of socio-
emotional characteristics that are critical for their engage-
ment in the learning process. On the other side, for teachers
and staff members, CK and PCK (Kleickmann et al., 2013;
Shulman, 1986) were predominant in answering the afore-
mentioned question.
These results are consistent with previous research that
has been conducted in Chile on the topic of teacher charac-
teristics (Conejeros-Solar et al., 2013); however, a more inte-
grative and democratic understanding can be depicted when
community voices are incorporated (Freire, 1968). The edu-
cational and interpersonal relationships experienced by the
BETA community provide a firsthand view that can enrich
the analysis of the critical aspects needed for instructors of
gifted students.
The results obtained from students and BETA staff and
teachers are consistent with what authors in the field of
teacher and teaching education have found, such as the
importance of CK and PCK (Shulman, 1986; VanTassel-
Baska, 2005). However, the analyses made by both groups
who participated in the study have different implications
in several realms, related to the role each has in the pro-
gram; therefore, the positioning of the participants in their
discourse (Frosh, Phoenix, & Pattman, 2003) and the lan-
guage they use (i.e., experiential vs. technical) is depen-
dent on the role and experiences that they have had in the
program.
Staff members of the programs and teachers were the ones
who mostly referred to CK as central for current and future
teachers of the program. They perceive the teacher as being
an expert, which translates into having a profound knowl-
edge of the field (Kleickmann et al., 2013) and being deeply
engaged with the content that he or she delivers to gifted
students. This conceptualization, therefore, depicts a teacher
who has developed a certain expertise over time and has
been actively involved in his or her disciplinary field.
Furthermore, one aspect that for participants cannot be sepa-
rated from CK is passion. For students, passion was under-
stood as a teacher who is deeply engaged with the content
and his or her students. As for teachers, passion was related
to being "deeply in-love" with the content he or she has to
deliver (Gentry et al., 2011).
Regarding pedagogical competencies or PCK, the views
of both study groups were different based on their experi-
ences. Students tended to compare BETA instructors with
their schoolteachers, and the overall conclusion is that the
latter have to adhere to a very rigid national curriculum with
no space for innovation, whereas BETA instructors can act
freely because of a learning environment that is open to cre-
ativity and allows teachers to be flexible and innovative with
his or her teaching practices. This is consistent with the find-
ings of Márquez and Martínez (2011), who state that the
teacher "has to do things different from average because his
students are different too" (p. 39). For teachers and staff,
flexibility is situated in the instructor, and they define it as
being capable of creating diverse learning opportunities for
students, being innovative in their teaching methods, and
adapting to students' needs and interests (VanTassel-Baska,
2005).
Gómez-Arizaga et al. 11
Concerning teacher characteristics, both groups consider
cognitive and socio-emotional aspects as essentials.Although
students prioritized socio-affective traits, they did not neglect
cognitive components, which is consistent with the results
found by Vialle and Tischler (2009). One of the salient socio-
affective traits is closeness, a construct defined by students
as a proximity in which teachers challenge and provide them
with opportunities to explore new ideas, listen actively, and
are open and approachable. This is similar to what Gentry,
Steenbergen-Hu, and Choi (2011) found in their study of
exemplary teachers, referring to the importance of the teacher
genuinely "connecting" with their gifted students. We inter-
pret the construct of closeness, especially affective and phys-
ical, as particular of the BETA community where emotional
bonds have been an implicit but critical aspect of the organi-
zation. Also, from a cultural stance, there is the Chilean (and
Latin American) culture that places high value on physical
demonstrations of affection.
For the BETA staff and teachers, a teacher's disposition to
promote a positive and nurturing classroom climate was seen
as critical interpersonal and intrapersonal characteristics
(Eyre, 2003). Even if for both groups socio-affective traits
are defined and manifested by participants in different ways,
they complement each other because for closeness to exist, a
teacher must also be able to create an adequate classroom
environment in which gifted students feel safe (Vogl &
Preckel, 2014). Another relevant aspect mentioned by this
group is the ability of teachers to be self-critical of their own
practices, and learn from feedback, which is consistent with
the findings of Vialle and Quigley (2002). The latter can be
related to another aspect of the organization, in which activi-
ties such as classroom observations and feedback meetings
are peer-collaboration elements that have a major role in the
BETA Program.
Limitations
The study presents limitations such as a small sample size
and a context in which these characteristics do not necessar-
ily extrapolate to other gifted programs worldwide.
Nevertheless, generalization is not the purpose of qualitative
inquiry, "but to understand how people create meaning in
their worlds and make sense of particular situations"
(Remshardt & Flowers, 2007, p. 5). Another limitation is
related to the approach we initially intended for data collec-
tion, which had an open-ended stance based on the collection
and analysis of emergent data from participants. However,
because of time constrictions we had to implement a more
structured approach than the original design, which trans-
lated into more structured questions and narrowed analyses.
Implications for Practice
The richness and depth of the analyses made by community
members offered a new perspective not only to be considered
at a discursive level but also for challenging current views
and making adaptations to the program's foundations, to
achieve a more democratic and holistic approach (Freire,
1968) to teachers' core competencies. Therefore, recruiting
policies and professional development activities in the BETA
program were revised and reformulated, taking into account
these community perspectives. By incorporating partici-
pants' views and perceptions of teacher competencies, a
detailed profile could be outlined and, therefore, may help in
the process of hiring instructors and analyzing the perfor-
mance of those who are already part of the program.
Hereunder, we offer a tentative proposal to address the
hiring process of future teachers of the gifted:
The results provided evidence about the complexities of
selecting a teacher for the gifted, and shed light on how good
this teacher must be, considering the intricate balance
between CK, PCK, and socio-affective characteristics that
are crucial in the teacher­student relationship. In this con-
text, it can be easier to certify an instructor's CK, but inter-
personal and intrapersonal characteristics are much harder to
evaluate; therefore, a selection process must be designed and
conducted, which can include traditional and non-traditional
practices such as the following:
·
· review of the CV;
·
· a personal statement that includes the prospective
teacher's motivation to teach gifted students;
·
· interview with a program instructor who teaches in
the same (or similar) academic field to assess disci-
pline-based competencies;
·
· assessment of cognitive flexibility and socio-emo-
tional variables such as empathy, assertiveness, and
motivation through the use of standardized tests;
·
· implementation of a 20-min activity with students so
they can assess cognitive and non-cognitive charac-
teristics; and
·
· personal interview with the program's staff
If some of these practices are adopted, there can be more
opportunities to find the best teachers and, therefore, to fos-
ter talent development in gifted students. These findings
have implications not only for recruitment but also for
teacher education programs that could contribute to prepar-
ing future teachers of the gifted with an array of skills com-
bining cognitive and pedagogical aspects, socio-affective
dispositions, and reflective practices. The comparison made
by the students in the study--who had the opportunity to
attend a program for the gifted--with their teachers in their
regular schools clearly shows this concern.
For the teachers who are already teaching in the program,
it is relevant to establish more opportunities to reflect about
what it is expected from them as teachers of gifted students
and to provide support in those areas in which they feel they
need to improve. Therefore, the staff needs to design profes-
sional development activities for teachers who can effectively
12 SAGE Open
address weaknesses and establish a community that fosters
the areas of strength.
Implications for Research
Clearly, further investigations need to be conducted on this
topic, especially to explore the phenomenon from the per-
spective of other Chilean programs that work with gifted stu-
dents. Also, cross-cultural research would be convenient to
analyze the profiles of teachers' competencies and character-
istics from different cultural perspectives, to identify unique
and distinctive teacher competencies from a culturally rele-
vant angle.
