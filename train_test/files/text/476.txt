Hypertension (HTN) confers increased cardiovascular disease
(CVD) risks, but decisions regarding initiating therapy and
treatment goal are normally based on a specific blood pres-
sure (BP) cutpoint rather than the individual's actual level of
risk.1­3 Not clear is how treatment and control of HTN may
vary according to level of CVD risk, and ultimately whether
clinical outcomes might be improved by global risk assessment.
It has been estimated that elimination of HTN could prevent
over half of stroke and a third of total CVD mortality.3,4 The
prevalence, treatment, and control of HTN have been widely
reported5,6, but how treatment and control of HTN differs by
level of risk has not been adequately described. In the European
PRATIK study, those with higher vs. lower CVD risk were less
likely to be controlled for HTN as compared to those with
HTN only.7 In addition, Fagard et al. have shown treatment
more likely in higher vs. lower risk subjects with HTN.8,9 More
recently, we showed among US adults with HTN those with vs.
without CVD were more likely to be treated, but less likely to
be controlled for BP.10 Framingham risk scores (FRS)11 have
been widely used to quantitative risk for CVD, but how global
risk varies in persons with HTN has not been described.
The updated FRS for total CVD11 provides an opportunity
to (i) evaluate the distribution of global CVD risk in subjects
with HTN using a strategy that places emphasis on a subject's
age, (ii) compare FRS algorithms with the European Society
of Hypertension (ESH) risk stratification guidelines,12 which
assess risk largely independent of age, and (iii) demonstrate
where gaps may exist on the extent of treatment and control of
HTN among different risk groups.

Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005­2006,13 a complex,
multistage sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US
population, we identified 1,509 subjects (weighted propor-

Global Cardiovascular Risk Associated With
Hypertension and Extent of Treatment and
Control According to Risk Group

Background
Hypertension (HTN) confers increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)
risk; however, the variation in risk and how treatment and control
rates may differ according to extent of risk needs clarification.We
examined CVD risk distribution and treatment and control patterns
according to risk group.
Methods
We estimated 10-year Framingham global risk in 1,509
US persons aged 30 years from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005­2006 with HTN
and the proportion of subjects in low (<10%), intermediate
(10­20%), and high (>20%) risk groups, or with pre-existing CVD,
or who otherwise had high cardiometabolic risk according to
European Society of Hypertension (ESH) criteria (diabetes (DM),
metabolic syndrome (MetS), stage 3 HTN, or 3 additional CVD
risk factors). We also examined HTN treatment and control rates
by risk group.

Conclusions
There is a wide variation in CVD risk in persons with HTN with control
rates still suboptimal in higher risk subjects. Future guidelines should
consider risk stratification combining shorter and longer-term risk
assessment to best identify those who have the greatest CVD risk.

and older out of a total of 3,469 subjects with BP and other
measures to classify global risk. NHANES data are publically
accessible and exempt from review by our institutional review
board.
Definitions.HTNwasdefinedasasystolicBP(SBP)140mmHg
or diastolic BP (DBP) 90mm Hg (or 130mm Hg systolic or
80mm Hg diastolic in persons with diabetes (DM) or chronic
kidney disease (CKD)) or treatment for HTN. BP was meas-
ured by standardized methodology using a mercury sphyg-
momanometer by a single NHANES medical examination
center physician certified by a BP certification program taking
the average of up to four readings (all but the first are aver-
aged) while the subject was sitting. Detailed specimen and data
collection are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual (NHANES 
1999­2000
Laboratory Technologists Manual).13 Treatment was defined
by self-report and from medication containers subjects brought
in providing the name and class of any antihypertensive medi-
cations. Nonpharmacologic treatment, including a low-fat
and low-sodium diet and moderate/vigorous physical activity
in the past 30 days was also recorded in NHANES, but is not
included within the definition of "treatment" to be consistent
with other NHANES publications.5,10
Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was calculated using
the Friedwald equation (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol =
total cholesterol--high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-
C) ­ (1/5) triglycerides) if triglycerides were under 400mg/dl.
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined by the presence of
3 of the following: (i) waist circumference >102cm for men
and >88cm for women, (ii) triglycerides 150mg/dl if fasting,
(iii) high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol <40mg/dl if male or
<50mg/dl if female, (iv) BP 130/85mm Hg or on antihyper-
tensive medications, and (v) fasting glucose level 100mg/
dl and <126mg/dl (while glucose levels above this point are
normally included in the definition of MetS, we are includ-
ing these individuals within the DM group as noted below).14
DM was defined as having a fasting glucose level 126mg/dl
or nonfasting level of 200mg/dl, taking oral hypoglycemic
medication or insulin, or with self-reported DM. CKD was
defined as having a creatinine clearance of <60ml/min (stage
3 or greater) using the MDRD formula: 186 × (serum creati-
nine (mg/dl)­1.154) × (Age­0.203) × 0.742(if female) × 1.210 (if
black).15 Besides CKD, pre-existing CVD included stroke,
heart failure, coronary heart disease, or myocardial infarc-
tion based on whether the participant was told by their doc-
tor they had these conditions. No information on peripheral
arterial disease was available. Control of BP was defined as an
SBP <140mm Hg and DBP <90mm Hg (or <130mm Hg and
<80mm Hg, respectively in persons with DM or CKD).
The 10-year risk of total CVD (including myocardial infarc-
tion, angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, congestive
heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease) was determined
in those without known CVD according to FRS algorithms11
including age, total and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol,
SBP, treatment for HTN, DM, and cigarette smoking. Persons
were classified as <10% (low risk), 10­20% (intermediate risk),
and >20% (high risk); those with pre-existing CVD or CKD
(as defined above) were classified separately.
We also classified persons according to the ESH guidelines12
which defines low risk (<10%) as having no other risk factors
(risk factors defined as the following: Low-density lipoprotein-
cholesterol 130mg/dl, current smoking, or low high-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, or impaired
fasting glucose as defined above) other than grade 1 HTN (SBP
140­159 or DBP 90­99), moderate risk as having one or two
additional risk factors with grade 1 HTN or grade 2 HTN (SBP
160­179mm Hg or DBP 100­109mm Hg) with 0­2 risk fac-
tors, high risk as having 3 risk factors other than HTN, MetS,
or DM along with grade 1 or 2 HTN, or grade 3 HTN with no
other risk factors, and very high risk for those with established
CVD or CKD, or grade 3 HTN with at least one risk factor,
MetS, or DM.
Data analysis. We compared the distribution of risk groups
(<10%, 10­20%, >20%, or pre-existing CVD) and prevalence
of treatment and lifestyle modifications by age (<45, 45­64,
and 65 years), gender, and ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites,
non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics). Among those with HTN
using the 2 test of proportions (and the Fisher's exact test in
tables where cell sizes <5 existed). Among those on treatment,
we also examined across risk groups the proportion on differ-
ent medication classes and on single or multiple medications,
as well as the proportion at overall, SBP and DBP goal. Finally,
we examined correlates of BP control using multiple logistic
regression in a fixed model, including age, gender, ethnic-
ity, CVD comorbidities, other CVD risk factors and number
of medications taken. First order interaction terms with age
and gender were also tested. We additionally examined the
concordance/discordance between FRS and ESH-based risk
classification.
SAS statistical software version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) and SUDAAN software version 9.0.1 were used for anal-
ysis and computation of weighted estimates for projection to
the population of the United States.16,17 The  probability level
set for statistical analyses was 0.05 (two-tailed). All estimates
presented reflect the age, gender, and ethnicity population-
weighted estimates.
Results
Among our sample of 1,509 subjects with HTN, 553 or 31.9%
(weighted proportion) had prevalent CVD, of which 125
(22.6%) had heart failure, 141 (25.5%) coronary heart disease,
147 (26.6%) myocardial infarction, and 142 (25.7%) stroke
(not mutually exclusive). 329 of these 553 subjects (59.5%)
had CKD as defined above. Overall, 28.9% had two of the
above conditions, and 2.0% had three or more of the above
conditions.
Overall, 55% of subjects with HTN were either high FRS
risk (>20%) (23%) or with prior CVD (32%) (total 55%
at high risk). Almost two-thirds of male hypertensives
(61%) are in the high risk/CVD groups vs. 49% of females

(P < 0.001) (Table 1). Hispanics with HTN were less likely
to be at higher risk than other ethnicities (P < 0.05). Also,
<10% of males and 15% of females <45 years old with
HTN were higher risk, but over 95% of males and 75% of
females aged 65+ were at this level. Overall, two-thirds of
subjects (66.8%) were on treatment, ranging from 58% in
those <10% risk to 66% in those with 10­20% and >20%
risk and 75% in those with prior CVD (P < 0.01) (Table 2).
Among those at low risk (<10%), treatment was much lower
among males (32%) than females (73%). Hispanics also had
much lower treatment rates than other ethnic groups, espe-
cially in lower risk persons (28%), but also in intermediate
risk and higher risk persons (40% and 45%, respectively);
among those with CVD, treatment rates were more simi-
lar among ethnic groups, and actually highest among non-
Hispanic blacks (86%). Of interest, among those with DM
or CKD, treatment rates were similar among those with BP
130­139/80­89mm Hg (56.1%) as compared to those with
BP 140­159/90­99mm Hg (62.6%) (P = 0.29). A low-fat or
weight-loss diet and moderate or vigorous physical activity
was less common in higher risk groups (P < 0.001 for physi-
cal activity only); few reported a low-sodium diet (6% or less
across all risk groups) (Table 2). There were no significant
differences between those reporting vs. not reporting phar-
macologic therapy (low fat diet 11.6% vs. 11.2% and mod-
erate/vigorous physical activity 59.5% vs. 55.6%) except a
low-sodium diet was more common in those on treatment
vs. not (4.7% vs. 1.7%, P < 0.01).

Among those on treatment for HTN, those at low risk were
most often at goal (93% of males, 88% of females, and 92% of
Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites, and 80% of non-Hispanic
blacks); however, this dropped substantially in persons at high
risk or with CVD, where less than half of most subgroups were
at goal for BP (Table 3). The poor control in high risk persons
was due principally to SBP not at goal; DBP was at goal 80%
of the time in all subgroups.
Table 4 shows the prevalence of use of specific medications as
well as number of medications according to risk group. Except
for use of angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium-channel
blockers, use of all other medications were significantly greater
across higher vs. lower risk groups (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001).
Also, use of monotherapy did not differ 
substantially by risk
group among those without CVD (49­56%), but using 3
medications expectedly was highest in those with CVD or
CKD (38%).
Multiple logistic regression (Table 5) shows factors associ-
ated with a lesser likelihood of BP control to include age (odds
ratio (OR) = 0.85/10 years, P < 0.05) and DM (OR = 0.40, P <
0.01), whereas the use of multiple medications (OR = 4.3 for
two medications and OR = 3.46 for three or more medications,
vs. monotherapy or untreated) was associated independently
with greater BP control (all listed variables are included in a
single model) (Hosmer­Lemeshow goodness of fit 2 = 22.7,
P = 0.004). Significant first order interactions of age and gender
included: age-number of medications ( = ­0.197, P = 0.024),
gender-race ( = 0.769, P = 0.003), and gender-coronary
heart disease ( = ­1.80, P = 0.001). When replacing risk fac-
tors other than age and gender with our global risk categories,
compared to low risk (<10%) persons, those at intermediate
risk (10­20%) had a significantly lower likelihood of control
of BP (OR = 0.48, P < 0.01), as did those at high (>20%) risk
(OR = 0.11, P < 0.001) and those with prior CVD (OR = 0.12,
P < 0.001).
Table 6 shows among persons defined to be at low risk
according to FRS, only 8% would be defined similarly by
ESH; 53% would actually be classified at moderate risk, and
38% at high risk by ESH. Among those at intermediate risk by
FRS, 44% would be classified similarly by ESH, 6% would be
downgraded to low risk, and 51% would be upgraded to high
or very high risk. Among those classified as high risk by FRS,
58% would be classified similarly by ESH and 34% would be
downgraded to intermediate and 2% to low risk status; how-
ever, 5% would be upgraded to very high risk. Therefore, close
to half of persons not identified by FRS as high risk or with
CVD (39% of low FRS and 51% of intermediate FRS persons)
would be identified in the high or very high risk ESH group.
Overall, while 55% of US persons with HTN qualify as high

Global Cardiovascular Risk in Hypertension
or very high risk (>20% or with CVD) by FRS, the additional
persons identified by ESH as high or very high risk brings this
up to 80% of US persons with HTN (Figure 1); only 20% were
at low or intermediate risk by both FRS and ESH.
Discussion
We show 55% of US persons with HTN were at high 10-year
risk of CVD by FRS criteria or had pre-existing CVD, and an
additional 39% of low and 51% of intermediate FRS groups
were at high risk of CVD by ESH criteria, with 80% overall at
high risk providing a compelling indication for antihyperten-
sive therapy. Also, HTN treatment was only modestly related
to global risk. Finally, treatment rates were lowest among lower
risk men and Hispanics and highest in those with pre-existing
CVD; however, control rates were actually best among lower
risk individuals but worst among higher risk persons. While
the FRS is influenced primarily by age; many younger persons
at a calculated low or intermediate risk actually have cardio
metabolic risk factors (identified by the ESH approach) that
would place them at higher longer-term risk.
Our reported 55% of HTN subjects at high risk based on FRS
(66% by ESH criteria) is compares to an Italian study where
about 60% were at high or very high risk based on European
guidelines.18 However, Volpe et al.19 among >52,000 Italian
patients with HTN found 43% to be a high or very high risk.
Also, among persons with isolated systolic HTN and diastolic
HTN, Fagard et al. showed 39.6% of the former and 68.4% of
the latter to be at high or very high risk.8 With a greater extent
of obesity and related cardiometabolic risk factors among our
HTN subjects, it is not surprising there may be more high risk
individuals in the United States.
Clinical strategies in initiating treatment for HTN
Our treatment rates of 58­66% among lower to higher risk
patients (75% in those with CVD) suggest global risk did not
dramatically influence treatment rates; all included subjects
would have had indications for treatment by US guidelines.
Suboptimal treatment rates may be attributed to many persons
not seeing their doctor recently, not taking medications as
recommended, or being just above the threshold where some
physicians may not want to prescribe medication until patients
have tried an adequate course of lifestyle. However, we found
lifestyle modification efforts not to differ by treatment status
except for a low-sodium diet being actually more common
among treated persons. Moreover, among those with DM or
CKD, treatment rates were similar regardless of BP category
(56% among those 130­139mm Hg SBP or 80­89 DBP vs.
63% in those with stage 1 HTN), suggesting actual BP levels
were not a strong indicator of treatment.
We feel use of shorter-term FRS algorithms to classify risk
undervalues lifetime risk and the ESH guidelines undervalue
shorter-term risk in older adults, and that combining both
strategies may best identify those needing treatment. Of note,
Marma et al.20 have previously shown among US adults free of
CVDaged20­79thatwhile82%areatlowshort-term(10-year)
risk, two-thirds of these individuals are at high lifetime pre-
dicted risk, thus supporting the concept that short-term risk

algorithms may dramatically underestimate long-term or life-
time risks. However, it is possible the use of both risk assess-
ment approaches could still result in overtreatment, thus the
cost-effectiveness using both vs. either risk algorithm still
needs to be demonstrated; those at high risk identified by
combining FRS and ESH risk assessment approaches would
hopefully motivate more aggressive treatment and presumably
improved health outcomes in these groups. Both approaches
rely primarily on easily obtainable office-based measures and
a count of risk factors or points that can be obtained by most
medical office nursing and other staff.
Treatment and control according to risk group
While treatment of low risk persons (58% treated) is less
aggressive than high-risk persons (66­75% treated), among
those treated, 53% of those with >20% 10-year risk and 27% of
those with CVD are only on monotherapy, a principal reason
less than half of such high risk persons are at goal BP. Also,
compared to those at low risk, intermediate risk persons were
at only half and higher risk persons at one-tenth the likelihood
of being in control for HTN. Another reason for the poorer BP
control in higher risk and older persons is the greater preva-
lence of having isolated systolic HTN where control of BP has
been previously shown much poorer.9,10
Strengths and limitations
Our NHANES sample is representative of the US adult popu-
lation from sample weighting methods; however, certain eth-
nic groups, such as Asian-Americans were not classified. Our
results reflect the US adult population with HTN and should not
be extrapolated to non-US populations. Also, while treatment
status was based on self-report, this was largely verified from
review of medication containers. Moreover, the FRS estimates of
CVD risk are based on a limited set of CVD risk factors and do
not include DBP, family history, obesity, or other factors which
could impact on risk, and other measures such as carotid intimal
medial thicknesses, left ventricular hypertrophy, or other target
organ damage were not available. Also, FRS was based on pri-
marily Caucasian cohorts, but robustness for use in other ethnic
groups has been validated.21 Finally, without follow-up data for
clinical events in our study sample, we were unable to compare
the predictive validity of our two risk assessment approaches.
In summary, half of US persons aged 30 years with HTN are
at high CVD risk or with known CVD and an additional one-
fourth have other factors indicating high cardiometabolic risk,
for a total of 80% at high risk who may warrant therapy. While
HTN treatment rates were lowest among lower risk persons
and highest in those with pre-existing CVD, HTN control rates
were best among lower risk individuals but lowest among higher
risk persons. Future guidelines should consider risk stratifica-
tion combining both shorter and longer-term risk assessment
approaches to identify persons at highest CVD risk.
