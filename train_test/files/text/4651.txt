Introduction
With the growing need to acquire a sustainable competitive
advantage, many organizations have moved toward flattened
hierarchies and self-managed teams (Antoni & Hertel, 2009).
Therefore, the use of teams has become an essential feature
in many organizations (Cohen & Bailey, 1997; Tasa, Taggar,
& Seijts, 2007). Given the reports from management and
scholars emphasizing the importance of teams for organiza-
tional success (Cohen & Bailey, 1997), understanding the
antecedents of team performance is critical for academic and
practitioner communities.
The team leader plays a central role in determining group
performance. For example, the research commissioned by
Project Management Institute (PMI) reported that the project
leadership style is a key success factor to project team per-
formance (Turner & Müller, 2005). Several taxonomies for
classifying leaders by style have been proposed in the litera-
ture. Among these, the transformational leadership style has
been one of the most cited theories of leadership (Judge &
Bono, 2000). Transformational leadership is defined as the
one that creates valuable and positive changes in its follow-
ers. Dvir, Eden, Avolio, and Shamir (2002) showed that
transformational leadership is highly effective in terms of
subordinates' development and performance. Although
research on transformational leadership has consistently
noted that there is an underlying process through which
transformational leaders exhibit their influences on their fol-
lowers' development and ultimately facilitate team perfor-
mance (e.g., Dvir et al., 2002; Walumbwa, Wang, Lawler, &
Shi, 2004; Wang & Howell, 2012), surprisingly relatively
little research has explored this topic especially in project
team settings.
Among the process variables associated with the transfor-
mational leadership process, trust has been acknowledged as
one important factor that can mediate the effect of the trans-
formational leadership on group outcomes (Braun, Peus,
Weisweiler, & Frey, 2013; Jung & Avolio, 2000; Zhu,
Newman, Miao, & Hooke, 2013). Another group process
variable that may emerge in the transformational leadership
process is collective efficacy (Zhang, Tsui, & Wang, 2011).
Prior studies have found the effects of transformational lead-
ership on collective efficacy (e.g., Arnold, Barling, &
Kelloway, 2001; Walumbwa et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2011),
trust (e.g., Arnold et al., 2001; Jung & Avolio, 2000), and
team performance (e.g., Jung & Avolio, 2000; Walumbwa
et al., 2004). However, the relationship between these factors

Transformational Leadership and Team
Performance: The Mediating Roles of
Cognitive Trust and Collective Efficacy
Huey-Wen Chou1, Yu-Hsun Lin2, Hsiu-Hua Chang1
and Wen-Wei Chuang1
Abstract
This study explores the relationships among transformational leadership style, cognitive trust, and collective efficacy as well
as the impact of these variables on distal team performance. Data collected from 39 teams find that team cognitive trust as
two process variables involves a transformational leadership process in which cognitive trust in the team leader and cognitive
trust among team members mediate the impact of this leadership style on collective efficacy. Unlike previous studies, our
results show that leveraging cognitive trust in the team leader is necessary but not sufficient for better proximal collective
efficacy, which in turn facilitates distal team performance. Although cognitive trust among team members was more closely
related to proximal collective efficacy than cognitive trust in the team leader was, the factors that foster the development
of cognitive trust among team members remain scantly explored in the transformational leadership literature and deserve
more attention in future research.

has not been fully scrutinized, especially in a project team
context. The present study therefore proposes a research
framework with the aim of investigating the tangled relation-
ships between transformational leadership, collective effi-
cacy, team cognitive trust, and team performance in project
team settings.
Team Performance in a
Transformational Leadership Process
Team performance refers to the extent to which a team
meets established objectives for quality, cost, and time
(Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001). The conceptualization of
team performance as a multidimensional construct is
acknowledged in the literature (Burke, Sims, Lazzara, &
Salas, 2007; Jung & Avolio, 2000). Jung and Avolio (2000)
identified three dimensions of team performance: quantity,
quality, and satisfaction. They found that transformational
leadership affects team performance through value congru-
ence and trust. Burke et al. (2007) suggested that team per-
formance is the distal outcome variable of trust in leadership.
Under transformational leadership, team's cognitive trust
and collective efficacy may evolve during the team devel-
opment and serve as process variables that explain the dis-
tal team performance.
Cognitive trust refers to individual beliefs about
peer reliability and dependability (McAllister, 1995).
Kanawattanachai and Yoo (2007) indicated that cognitive
trust grounded in the beliefs regarding others' ability and
reliability to accomplish a task (Kanawattanachai & Yoo,
2007). Dirks and Skarlicki (2004) found that a team leader
with effective transformational leadership style was bene-
ficial to gain subordinates' trust. In teamwork settings,
team members collaborate and rely on other members'
competency and professionalism to complete the assigned
task. Members of a team without building cognitive trust
among team members are not willing to put more efforts to
coordinate their actions for performing the given task.
Akgün, Keskin, Byrne, and Imamoglu (2007) demon-
strated a strong beneficial effect of interpersonal trust on
software project teams' collective efficacy.
Collective efficacy is defined as "a group's shared belief
in its conjoint capabilities to organize and execute courses of
action required to produce given levels of attainment"
(Bandura, 1997, p. 477). Jung and Sosik (2002) found that
collective efficacy was related to the performance of a work
group in the transformational leadership process. Walumbwa
et al. (2004) demonstrated that collective efficacy emerges
from the team development and mediates the impact of trans-
formational leadership on work outcomes.
Collective efficacy involves individuals' perceptions
regarding the group's performance capability (Kozub &
McDonnell, 2000). When individuals hold strong collective
efficacy, they are likely to devote more effort to achieving
goals (Bandura, 1986). Studies have indicated that collective
efficacy has a positive impact on team performance (Gully,
Beaubien, Incalcaterra, & Joshi, 2002) and that it relates to
group performance in different contexts, including education
(Parker, 1994), sports (Kozub & McDonnell, 2000), and
organizations (Gibson, 2003). Based on the results of previ-
ous studies, we propose the following hypothesis.
Hypothesis 1: A team's collective efficacy has a positive
impact on team performance.
Studying the trust within a group has attracted many
researchers' attention (Dirks & Skarlicki, 2004; Simons &
Peterson, 2000). McKnight, Cummings, and Cherany (1998)
described trust as the belief and the willingness to depend on
another party. When team members perceive a high level of
trust in their interactions, they tend to devote more effort to
cooperative behaviors (Kramer, Brewer, & Hanna, 1996).
Trust is therefore an important variable in explaining why
team members are willing to complete their jobs jointly in a
team project setting.
Trust in a team may include different dimensions, such as
trust in the team leader and trust among members. Previous
research has mainly focused on trust in the team leader; nev-
ertheless, the impact of trust among team members on distal
outcomes has not gained much attention. Dirks and Skarlicki
(2004) suggested that focusing solely on a team's trust in a
supervisor may ignore other important referents. Therefore,
exploring the impact of team cognitive trust, such as cogni-
tive trust among team members, is a must for researchers to
obtain a more complete understanding of the team-based
working relationships. This study conceptualizes team cog-
nitive trust as having two dimensions: cognitive trust in the
team leader and cognitive trust among team members.
Trust in a leader was frequently found to mediate the
leadership-outcome relationship in studies of leadership
processes (e.g., Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Dirks & Skarlicki,
2004; Hoyt & Blascovich, 2003; Jung & Avolio, 2000); nev-
ertheless, different referents of trust may have different con-
sequences in the leadership process (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002).
Dirks and Skarlicki (2004) suggested that a team leader not
only takes action to build the team's trust in the team leader
but also fosters the development of trust among team mem-
bers necessary to perform a given task effectively.
Research on project management found that trust is
likely to be an antecedent of collective efficacy. Akgün et
al. (2007) found that strong interpersonal trust enhanced
software project teams' collective efficacy. They suggested
that mutual trust among team members will facilitate team
members to collaborate more effectively. If a team builds
stronger cognitive trust among team members, members
of the team are willing to put more efforts to work together
and become more confident in the group's ability to
successfully complete a task. Thus, higher cognitive trust
among team members would help enhance team's collec-
tive efficacy.
Chou et al. 3
Cognitive trust in the team leader, however, is members'
confidence in the team leader. Its influence on collective effi-
cacy is proposed to be weaker than cognitive trust among
team members is. This study therefore hypothesizes that the
effect of cognitive trust among team members on collective
efficacy is stronger than the effect of cognitive trust in the
team leader on collective efficacy.
Hypothesis 2: Cognitive trust among team members has a
stronger positive effect on collective efficacy than cog-
nitive trust in the team leader does.
Leadership is "the process of influencing individuals or
groups so as to achieve group goals" (Hoyt & Blascovich,
2003, p. 679). Transformational leadership has been found to
be positively associated with trust in the team leader, collec-
tive efficacy (e.g., Hoyt & Blascovich, 2003), and team per-
formance (e.g., Hoyt & Blascovich, 2003; Jung & Avolio,
2000). According to Bass (1985), transformational leaders
exert influence on subordinates by broadening and elevating
followers' goals and providing them with the confidence to
go beyond specified, minimally acceptable expectations. The
literature (e.g., Avolio & Bass, 1995; Podsakoff, MacKenzie,
Moorman, & Fetter, 1990) has confirmed that trust in the
leader is a consequence of transformational leadership
because transformational leaders empower and encourage
followers to make decisions, thus gaining their followers'
trust. Jung and Avolio (2000) confirmed that trust in the team
leader helps to explain the impact of transformational leader-
ship on performance. The mediating role of trust in the team
leader on the relationship between transformational leader-
ship and performance was also confirmed in Hoyt and
Blascovich's (2003) study of virtual and physical working
environments.
What is the relationship between a transformational lead-
ership and cognitive trust among team members? Few stud-
ies have addressed this question. Shamir, House, and Arthur
(1993) suggested that transformational leaders build follow-
ers' personal and social identification and enhance members'
feelings of cohesiveness. Sosik, Avolio, and Kahai (1997)
found that transformational leadership positively affects the
level of creative output generated by team members. This
implies that transformational leaders can facilitate interde-
pendent work among group members and encourage mem-
bers to work together, help team members establish a sense
of cognitive trust, and foster positive feelings among them-
selves. In other words, transformational leadership may
directly influence trust among team members. In this regard,
transformational leadership may exert a different effect on
trust in the team leader as it does on trust among team mem-
bers. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypothesis
to investigate whether a transformational leadership style's
impact on cognitive trust in the team leader is different from
its impact on cognitive trust among team members.
Hypothesis 3: A transformational leadership style has a
different effect on cognitive trust in the team leader as
its effect on cognitive trust among team members.
Collective efficacy is team members'shared belief regard-
ing the team's ability to accomplish a given task, which may
result from the building of cognitive trust within a team.
Researchers have indicated that a transformational leader
through displaying idealized influence, intellectual stimula-
tion, inspirational motivation, and individualized consider-
ation could facilitate team members' trust in the leader (e.g.,
Jung & Avolio, 2000) and mutual trust among team members
(e.g., Zhu et al., 2013). In the team process, transformational
leadership is beneficial to the establishment of team cogni-
tive trust (Zhu et al., 2013). When a team leader displays a
transformational leader style, team members will perceive a
high level of team cognitive trust and therefore will be more
likely to perceive to others' ability and reliability to perform
a task (Kanawattanachai & Yoo, 2007; McAllister, 1995).
Accordingly, team cognitive trust is likely to be related to a
team's collective efficacy in the transformational leadership
process.
As discussed earlier, transformational leadership would help
to foster team cognitive trust, which in turn would positively
leverage collective efficacy. Team cognitive trust therefore may
play a mediating role in the relation between transformational
leadership and collective efficacy. Nevertheless, relatively little
empirical research appeared to have investigated the mediat-
ing role of team cognitive trust in the transformational lead-
ership-collective efficacy relationship. Given that team
cognitive trust is likely to be the (or a) consequence of trans-
formational leadership and the antecedent of collective effi-
cacy, this study argues that the impact of transformational
leadership on collective efficacy is likely to come from its
mediating effect via team cognitive trust.
Based on the arguments and evidences above, this study
therefore proposes that team cognitive trust mediates the
transformational leadership-collective efficacy relationship
(cf., Figure 1).
Hypothesis 4: A transformational leadership will have an
indirect positive effect, mediated through cognitive
trust in the team leader on collective efficacy.
Hypothesis 5: A transformational leadership will have an
indirect positive effect, mediated through cognitive
trust among team members on collective efficacy.
Method
The aim of this study was to empirically examine the pro-
posed model with collective efficacy and team cognitive
trust as the mediators of the transformational leadership-team
performance relationship. The research questions to be
addressed in this study include the following: (a) how do
4 SAGE Open
transformational leadership and team cognitive trust influ-
ence collective efficacy, which in turn affects team perfor-
mance; and (b) is team performance affected by a series of
mediating processes? A survey was conducted to empirically
examine the proposed model. The original instrument
adopted in this study is the English version, and therefore a
panel of experts including authors was responsible for trans-
lating the instrument into Chinese. First, one author trans-
lated the original instrument into Chinese. Therefore, another
author screened and corrected the error of the translation.
Finally, the first author administered a panel meeting to
refine the translation. To validate the Chinese version instru-
ment, several master students in the management college of
university in northern Taiwan were invited to participate in a
pilot test. According to the feedback from the participants
and the result of the pilot test, the Chinese version instrument
was refined again.
Sample and Data Collection
The sample consisted of various team types from different
organizations in Taiwan. Multiple members from each team
were invited to answer the questionnaires. Kumar, Stern, and
Anderson (1993) indicated that data collected from a single
informant were highly correlated with team consensual data.
However, one may raise some concerns about the reliability
and validity of informant report as we asked only one mem-
ber of a team to answer the questionnaire. To ensure that the
responses were representative of that team, two members of
each team were randomly picked to answer the question-
naire. The calculation of interrater reliability (R
wg
; James,
Demaree, & Wolf, 1984) was used to determine whether the
two team members' responses were correlated.
A total of 320 questionnaires were distributed to 160
teams in organizations in Taiwan, and 98 questionnaires
were returned. Of these, 92 questionnaires from 46 teams
were valid, yielding a response rate of 28.75%. The number
of people per team ranged from 3 to 35 with an average of
8.78 people. The average duration for a team was 32.5
months, with a range of 4 to 120 months. Team types included
IS (information systems) integration (12), quality improve-
ment (11), R&D (7), business management (5), customer ser-
vice (3), production (1), sales (1), and others (6).Atotal of 27
teams (58.7%) were temporary in nature.
Measures
The instruments used to measure research variables are
described below.
Transformational leadership style.Twenty-four items adapted
from Cheung, Ng, Lam, and Yue (2001) were used to mea-
sure four aspects of transformational leadership of the proj-
ect team leader. Each aspect of transformational leadership
including charisma, inspirational motivation, intellectual
stimulation, and individualized consideration was measured
by six items, respectively. The items wordings were refined
to adapt to the team's context. Respondents were asked to
judge each statement in terms of their team leader's overall
leadership behavior based on their experiences in that spe-
cific team. They were to evaluate how frequently, on aver-
age, their team leader displayed the described behaviors on a
5-point response scale (from 1 = never to 5 = always). A
sample item for charisma was, "The project team leader
makes the team members enthusiastic about the project." A
sample item for individualized consideration was, "The proj-
ect team leader finds out what I want and helps me to get it."
A sample item for intellectual stimulation was, "The project
team leader enables me to think about old problems in new
ways." A sample item for inspirational motivation was, "The
project team leader stimulates enthusiasm among project
team members for the work of group." Cronbach's alpha
coefficient was = .975, which exceeds the recommended
level of .70 (Nunnally, 1978).
Team cognitive trust.
The measures were adapted from
Kanawattanachai and Yoo (2002). Scale items were revised
to measure two types of team cognitive trust: cognitive trust
among team members and cognitive trust in the team leader.
Four items measuring each type of trust were used using a
5-point Likert-type scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 =
strongly agree). A sample item for cognitive trust in the team
leader is, "I see no reason to doubt my team leader's compe-
tence and preparation for the job." A sample item for cogni-
tive trust among team members is, "I see no reason to doubt
my teammates' competence and preparation for the job."
Cronbach's alpha coefficients for cognitive trust in the team
leader and for trust among team members were = .848 and

.799, respectively, which exceeded the threshold of .7 (Nun-
nally, 1978).
Collective efficacy.Five items measuring collective efficacy
was adapted from Jung and Sosik (2002). Wordings were
adapted to adjust to the project team context. Five items were
measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale (from 1 = strongly
disagree to 5 = strongly agree). A sample item was, "My
project team can find solutions to problems with its perfor-
mance." Cronbach's alpha coefficient was = .868, which
exceeded the recommended level of .7 (Nunnally, 1978).
Team performance. This research adapts six items of Hoegl
and Gemuenden's (2001) measure to assess team perfor-
mance. Efficiency refers to the adherence to schedules and
budgets. Effectiveness refers to the degree to which the team
meets expectations regarding the quality of the outcome. In
other words, effectiveness reflects the assessment of out-
comes, while efficiency is the assessment of input. Each
question was measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale (from
1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). A sample item of
effectiveness was, "From the company's perspective, all
project goals were achieved." A sample item of efficiency
was, "From the company's perspective, one could be satis-
fied with how the project progressed." The value of Cron-
bach's alpha was = .939, which exceeded the threshold of .7
(Nunnally, 1978).
Results
Model testing and data analysis were tested using the partial
least squares (PLS) approach. The PLS approach is suitable
for research with a small sample size (Chin, Marcolin, &
Newsted, 2003). According to Chin et al.'s (2003) sugges-
tion, the sample size requirement for the PLS approach
should equal to or above 10 times the largest numbers of
structural paths directed toward a particular construct. As
depicted in Figure 1, the largest numbers of structural paths
are two paths directed to collective efficacy, which indicated
that the requirement for sample size in our proposed model
should be equal to or above 20 teams. The sample size of this
study is 46 samples and therefore satisfies the requirement.
This study calculates interrater reliability (R
wg
; James
et al., 1984) to investigate within-group agreement on the
rating for each team. Out of the 46 teams' interrater reliabil-
ity coefficients for constructs, 7 did not exceed the threshold
levels of reliability (.7) as suggested by George (1990) and
were dropped from subsequent analysis. For transforma-
tional leadership, the average R
wg
coefficients of charisma,
inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and indi-
vidualized consideration were .967, .970, .968, .957, and .98,
respectively. The average R
wg
coefficients of cognitive trust
in the team leader, cognitive trust among team members, col-
lective efficacy, and team performance were .970, .966, .972,
and .971, respectively.
Measurement Model
Confirmatory factor analysis was first conducted to assess
the measurement model. Cronbach's alpha and composite
reliability were used to examine reliability. As shown in pre-
vious paragraphs, all of the Cronbach's alphas were well
above .7, the threshold suggested by Nunnally (1978), indi-
cating the scale reliability of all major variables reached an
acceptable level. As shown in Table 1, the composite reli-
ability coefficients were all above .6, as suggested by Fornell
and Larcker (1981). Convergent validity was assessed by
examining the average variance extracted (AVE) from the
measures (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2006).
Table 1 shows that the values of AVE were all above the
threshold of .5 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Discriminant
validity was confirmed by looking at the square root of AVE.
The values of the square root of AVE (depicted in Table 1)
were all larger than the interconstruct correlations (Fornell &
Larcker, 1981). The variance inflation factor (VIF) that
measures whether the collinearity existed was assessed.
The values of VIF for all constructs are smaller than the
threshold value of 10 (Hair et al., 2006). The result indicated
that the collinearity effect in the constructs studied was not
significant.

Structural Model
Figure 2 illustrates the path coefficients of the proposed
research model. All of the path coefficients were significant.
Constructs depicted in dashed lines represent mediating vari-
ables (n = 39). All path coefficients are statistically signifi-
cant at .01 level.
Hypothesis 1 examined the association between collec-
tive efficacy and team performance. The path coefficient of
collective efficacy to team performance is positive and sig-
nificant ( = 0.676, p < .01). Therefore, Hypothesis 1 was
supported.
Hypothesis 2 tested the relative impacts of two types of
team cognitive trust on collective efficacy. The path of cog-
nitive trust among team members to collective efficacy was
significant ( = 0.504, p < .01), whereas the path from cogni-
tive trust in the team leader to collective efficacy was also
significant ( = 0.338, p < .01) but smaller than the path from
cognitive trust among team members to collective efficacy.
The result revealed that cognitive trust among team members
has stronger positive impacts on collective efficacy than cog-
nitive trust in the team leader does. Therefore, Hypothesis 2
was supported.
Hypothesis 3 tested whether the impact of a transforma-
tional leadership style on cognitive trust in the team leader is
greater than its impact on cognitive trust among team mem-
bers. The path coefficient of transformational leadership
style to cognitive trust in the team leader was positively
significant ( = 0.758, p < .01) and the magnitude is larger
than the path coefficient of transformational leadership to
cognitive trust among team members ( = 0.507, p < .01).
Thus, Hypothesis 3 was supported.
Hypothesis 4 and Hypothesis 5 examined whether team
cognitive trust mediates the transformational leadership-
collective efficacy relationship. The Sobel test (1982) was
used to examine the mediation effect of team cognitive trust.
Two independent PLS models exemplified by the SmartPLS
2.0 bootstrap procedure with 200 re-samples were conducted
to generate the necessary t values. Model 1 included two
paths from transformational leadership (the independent
variable) to cognitive trust in the team leader and cognitive
trust among team members (two mediators). Model 2
included two paths from cognitive trust in the team leader
and cognitive trust among team members (two mediators) to
collective efficacy (the dependent variable). As depicted in
Table 2, the showed t values and the corresponding z values
for the Sobel test were all significant. The results indicated
that cognitive trust in the team leader mediated the impact of
transformational leadership on collective efficacy (z value
for the Sobel test = 4.837, p < .01) and the effect of transfor-
mational leadership on collective efficacy was also signifi-
cantly mediated by cognitive trust among team members (z
value for the Sobel test = 4.869, p < .01). Thus, Hypothesis 4
and Hypothesis 5 were supported.
Discussion
In attempting to understand the roles of cognitive trust and
collective efficacy in the transformational leadership-team
performance relationship, this study proposed five hypothe-
ses with aims to examine how transformational leadership
and cognitive trust affect collective efficacy, which therefore
influences team performance. The result of the study sup-
ported all five hypotheses confirming the intertwined rela-
tionships between transformational leadership style, team
cognitive trust, collective efficacy, and team performance.
The significant impact of collective efficacy on team per-
formance (Hypothesis 1) was consistent with prior research
findings (Gully et al., 2002; Tasa et al., 2007). The formation
of collective efficacy by way of the impact of two types of
team cognitive trust was confirmed (Hypothesis 2). In par-
ticular, this study found that collective efficacy was enhanced

more by cognitive trust among team members more than by
cognitive trust in the team leader. Therefore, cognitive trust
among team members is also a necessary element of team
trust in exploring the formation of collective efficacy. The
confirmation of Hypothesis 3 revealed that transformational
leadership had a greater association with cognitive trust in
the team leader than with cognitive trust among team members.
Cognitive trust in the team leader and cognitive trust among
team members significantly mediated the transformational
leadership-collective efficacy relationship (Hypotheses 4 and
5). Transformational leadership style affected collective effi-
cacy by way of cognitive trust in the team leader and cogni-
tive trust among team members. That is, through team
cognitive trust, transformational leadership will help foster a
team's collective efficacy and leads to the distal outcome:
team performance. In other words, the impact path from
transformational leadership to team performance is by way
of team cognitive trust and collective efficacy. Cognitive
trust in the team leader and cognitive trust among team mem-
bers extend the influence of a transformational leadership
style to collective efficacy and then ultimately to the proxi-
mal outcome, team performance.
In summary, the confirmations of five hypotheses pro-
vided a satisfactory answer to the research question: team
performance was affected by a series of mediating process
wherein transformational leadership through cognitive trust
influenced collective efficacy (the proximal outcome) and
ultimately led to team performance (the distal outcome).
Conclusion
Accumulated literatures have evidenced the causal linkage
between transformational leadership and team cognitive trust
(e.g., Zhu et al., 2013). The inquiry regarding how transfor-
mational leadership and team cognitive trust affect collective
efficacy and therefore affects team performance has not been
well understood in previous research. The present study pro-
vided the initial step to explore how team cognitive trust
mediates the impact of transformational leadership on col-
lective efficacy. We empirically assessed the antecedents
(transformational leadership) and consequences (collective
efficacy) of team cognitive trust. The transformational lead-
ership directly helped foster members' cognitive trust in the
team leader and cognitive trust among team member. As
team cognitive trust in the leadership process increased, the
collective efficacy of a team was enhanced accordingly,
which in turn helped to lead to better team performance.
Academic Implications
Our research contributes the following to academic research.
First, this study conceptualized team cognitive trust as a
two-dimensional construct: cognitive trust in the team leader
and cognitive trust among team members. Such a conceptu-
alization of team cognitive trust not only broadens the
boundary of team trust beyond trust "in the leader" but also
closely reflects the real cognitive aspects of a team. We sug-
gest that team cognitive trust may simultaneously emerge in
the interaction among team members and leaders as well
as during the teamwork process. In summary, this study
helps to describe the two referents of cognitive trust as two
separate process variables in the transformation leadership
processes.
Second, we characterized team cognitive trust using two
referents, cognitive trust in the leader and cognitive trust
among team members. The findings confirmed that two dis-
tinct constructs of team cognitive trust can be empirically
classified, and the development of collective efficacy is
largely dependent on cognitive trust among team members.
Such a classification is beneficial for comparing which type
of team cognitive trust contributes more to collective
efficacy.
Finally, the study incorporated the model of collective
efficacy from social cognitive theory into the framework of
trust in leadership theory. We theorized and validated the
causal relationships between transformational leadership,
cognitive trust, collective efficacy, and the team's perfor-
mance as a chain. Consistent with Burke et al.'s (2007)
framework, our findings empirically confirmed that team
cognitive trust under the transformational leadership process
was related to proximal outcomes (collective efficacy) and
distal outcomes (team performance). In conclusion, the find-
ings offer theoretical and empirical valuable insights into
how transformational leadership impacts team performance
through various mediating variables.
Managerial Implications
Our study provides some managerial implications for team
practices. This study confirmed the two elements of team
cognitive trust, which is cognitive trust in the team leader
and cognitive trust among team members. Specifically, cog-
nitive trust in team leader and cognitive trust among team
member mediated the impact of transformational leadership
on collective efficacy which, in turn, led to better team per-
formance. Therefore, effectively developing team cognitive
trust including cognitive trust in the team leaders and cogni-
tive trust among team member is a critical issue in the team
context. Team leaders or managers should work on being
active transformational leaders to help foster team mem-
bers' cognitive trust in the team leader and cognitive trust
among team members, which in turn will facilitate the
development of collective efficacy and ultimately enhance
team performance.
Limitations and Future Research
The target scope of the study primarily focused on how cog-
nitive trust and collective efficacy intervene in the transfor-
mational leadership-team performance relationship at team
8 SAGE Open
level. The result of the study provided empirical support for
our proposed model and further confirmed the important role
of team cognitive trust in the transformational leadership
process. Nevertheless, data analysis solely targeted at team
level and some other process variables naturally associated
with the transformational leadership were not incorporated
into the proposed model. Some limitations remain, and future
implications are described as follows.
First, to gain a clearer understanding of the evolution of
team trust in the leadership process, a complementary longi-
tudinal research design is suggested. Recent studies on group
research have highlighted the development of cognitive trust
and affective trust in the team process (Webber, 2008; Zhu
et al., 2013). For example, Webber's (2008) study exploring
the development of affective and cognitive trust in student
project teams revealed that affective trust emerges early in
the early stage of team development, whereas cognitive trust
does not. Conversely, Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, and Dirks (2004)
suggested that the early development of trust is likely to be
determined by its cognitive dimensions, such as group mem-
bership and reputation. Obviously, what types of trust
emerges in the early stage of team development still remains
blurred. Therefore, future research should examine the
development of affective and cognitive trust in the team
leader and among team members longitudinally to clarify
their relationship in the team development process.
Second, the effects of selected control variables such as
physical versus virtual teams, team size, and task type should
be studied in future research. The low response rate of
28.75% and the small sample size of 39 teams in the present
study limited this possibility. A larger sample size should be
included in the future research to capture the effects of team
size and task type.
Third, self-reported team performance may bias the
results. Future research may avoid this by collecting multiple
measures of team performance, such as supervisor's evalua-
tions of team performance or a team's key performance indi-
cator (KPI). In addition, the finding of the study described a
sample from project teams. The generalizability to different
contexts, such as an educational context or a sporting con-
text, should be assumed with caution in future research.
Fourth, this study only focused on how transformational
leadership is associated with selected group variables,
including cognitive trust and collective efficacy. There
remain many other group variables, such as identification
(Wang & Howell, 2012) and cohesion (Nielsen & Daniels,
2012), that could bond team members together, in achieving
group outcomes. Further research may explore the roles of
these factors in the transformational leadership processes.
Finally, multilevel investigations of the transformational
leadership into the team development process and follower
outcomes have received many attentions recently (e.g.,
Nielsen & Daniels, 2012; Wang & Howell, 2012). A multi-
level investigation of the transformational leadership in
relation to trust, efficacy, identification, and cohesion may
provide our richer understandings of how team performance
and follower outcomes could be achieved by series of medi-
ating process.
