Excess weight has generally been associated with adverse health outcomes; however, the link between overweight and health
outcomes may vary with socioeconomic, cultural, and epidemiological conditions. We examine associations of weight with
indicators of biological risk in three nationally representative populations: the US National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study in Taiwan.
Indicators of biological risk were compared for obese (defined using body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference) and normal
weight individuals aged 54+. Generally, obesity in England was associated with elevated risk for more markers examined; obese
Americans also had elevated risks except that they did not have elevated blood pressure (BP). Including waist circumference in
our consideration of BMI indicated different links between obesity and waist size across countries; we found higher physiological
dysregulation among those with high waist but normal BMI compared to those with normal waist and normal BMI. Americans
had the highest levels of biological risk in all weight/waist groups. Cross-country variation in biological risk associated with obesity
may reflect differences in health behaviors, lifestyle, medication use, and culture.
1. Introduction
Rising levels of obesity are becoming a worldwide phe-
nomenon and are increasingly identified as a health problem
across the globe [1­4]. Higher weight has been associated
with adverse health indicators and outcomes, including
cardiovascular disease [5­12], stroke [5, 13], cognitive and
functional decline [14­18], metabolic syndrome [19, 20],
inflammation [21, 22], and mortality [20, 23­25]. Obesity
among aging populations is relatively recent and aging among
people who have been obese for much of their lives is also a
new phenomenon [26]. From 1980 to 2004, the prevalence
of obesity in the US has continued to rise from about 17%
to 25% for men aged 50­59. While obesity in England has
also increased during this period, from approximately 9%
in 1980 to 15% in 2004 for men aged 55­64, the level of
obesity remains much lower in England [26]. Additionally,
the difference in obesity between the US and England is
more pronounced for women. The level of obesity in US
women was about 24% in 1980 and rose to 37% in 2004
(age 50­59); in England, levels for women were 9% in 1980
and 14% in 2004 (age 55­64). The aim of this paper is to
investigate differences in how obesity relates to indicators of
physiological dysregulation in men and women of diverse
populations. This comparison will lead to an improved
understanding of how obesity might be differentially related
to health and mortality across cultures and lifestyles.
Obesity was relatively rare in most populations until
the second part of the last century, but it has now become
common in many countries [27]. The US population is
recognized as among the most obese in the world, although
many other countries are now approaching the US level
and most countries are experiencing increasing obesity. This
worldwide obesity epidemic began with the epidemiological
2 Journal of Obesity
revolution and the virtual elimination of infectious disease;
the decline in manual labor needed to provide sustenance
with the industrial revolution; and the increasing availability
and decreasing cost of food [27­29].
Obesity may result from behavioral differences across cul-
tures or among individuals within cultures. Obesity reflects
some combination of calorie intake, diet content, and amount
of physical activity. In some cultures, lack of physical activity
can be a more important determinant of obesity; in other
cultures, overeating or food composition may be the more
important determinant of obesity. It is also true that within
countries, individuals could differ in the causes of obesity. For
instance, changes in activity might be more characteristic of
women or men resulting in different reasons for obesity by
gender.
These differences may affect how obesity is related to
other risk factors for poor health, and it may determine the
overall health risk associated with obesity. If physical activity
is maintained, the overall effect of obesity may be less than
if the activity is not. One indication of the cause of obesity
may be the relationship between waist size and weight [30, 31].
In societies where obese people are more physically active,
waist size of the obese may be smaller than where physical
activity levels are lower. Waist circumference has also been
linked to late life mortality, where high waist circumference
has been associated with increased mortality among men
and women in The Netherlands, while high BMI was not
associated with mortality [32]. This paper builds upon current
obesity research by using both BMI and waist circumference
to quantify obesity in order to determine how a combined
indicator of weight and adiposity is related to physiological
dysregulation in populations with different cultures, diets,
behaviors, and epidemiological histories.
Obesity has been related to many indicators of physi-
ological dysregulation including cardiovascular risk factors
such as hypertension [33] and metabolic dysregulation in
lipid levels or insulin resistance [34]. Obesity is also related
to higher levels of systemic inflammation [35]. Most studies
that investigate the differences in biological risk associated
with excess weight have examined Western populations [33,
36]. Comparative studies on the health risks associated
with obesity that examined the US and England reported
that obese Americans had an increased risk of diabetes
and a higher waist circumference [37, 38]. These studies
suggested that differences in physical activity, diet, and social
environments may explain these national differences. While
these differences have been observed between the US and
England, these two Western countries have roughly similar
life expectancy, levels of living, history, and culture even while
the US has poorer health by a number of indicators of disease
prevalence and biological risk [36, 39].
Comparative studies of the links between obesity and
health outcomes and risk factors for obesity comparing
Western and non-Western countries indicate important dif-
ferences in the causes and consequences of obesity. A compar-
ison of the association of disease with overweight and obesity
in Japan and the US indicated that the associations were
stronger in the US than in Japanese women and that there was
no association in Japanese men [40]. Links between social,
demographic, and behavioral risk factors for obesity also dif-
fer markedly in Japan, Korea, and the US [41]. The availability
of biomarker data from Taiwan--a middle-income country
undergoing rapid economic growth, increasing obesity, and
with life expectancy recently increasing to levels similar to
that of the US and England--allows for investigation of the
biological risk associated with obesity in a population charac-
terized by very different cultural, behavioral, socioeconomic,
and dietary parameters.
We examine how elevated weight and obesity (using an
indicator that considers both BMI and waist circumference)
relate to having levels defined as clinical risk for cardiovas-
cular, metabolic, and inflammatory markers in three aging
societies that are now relatively similar in life expectancy but
that differ in the timing of the epidemiological transition and
obesity epidemic, history of economic development, socioe-
conomic levels, general lifestyle habits, health behaviors, and
health care systems: the US, England, and Taiwan. Finding
differences in the relationship between obesity and indicators
of physiological dysregulation in these three aging societies
will clarify whether increases in weight gain are equally
problematic across all countries.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants and Settings. We use data from three nation-
ally representative samples: the US National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2003­2006;  =
3855), the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA,
2004-2005;  = 9139), and the Social Environment and
Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) in Taiwan (2000;  =
1023). These surveys collect information on demographics,
as well as anthropometric, physical, and biological measures.
NHANES regularly monitors the health and nutritional
status of the US population. Every year, approximately 5,000
individuals undergo detailed interviews and medical exam-
inations, which include collection of several physiological
measures. NHANES utilizes a complex sampling design, and
when weights are applied, the sample is representative of
the noninstitutionalized American population. We use the
2003­2006 data since NHANES data is released in two-
year intervals, and this sample is centered on 2004-2005,
which matches the period in which ELSA was collected. For
NHANES, we use individual-level data based on a sample of
1,513 fasting individuals aged 54 and older.
ELSA includes participants drawn from households
responding to the Health Survey for England (HSE) in 1998,
1999, and 2001 [42] and is representative of the English
population aged 50 and older. The core ELSA sample (wave
1: 2002-2003) includes people living in an HSE responding
household who were born prior to March 1, 1952, and their
partners who could be under age 50. Wave 4 of ELSA (2008-
2009), which includes a nurse visit, includes wave 1 core
members, if they are still alive and do not refuse further
contact after the first interview at wave 1. It also includes a
refresher sample to maintain the age structure of the sample
(in waves 3 and 4), and their partners. For ELSA, we use
individual-level data based on a sample of 7,384 individuals
aged 54 and older.

SEBAS is drawn from a follow-up survey of the Survey
of Health and Living Status of the Near Elderly and Elderly
in Taiwan (also known as the Taiwan Longitudinal Study
of Aging (TLSA)), a nationally representative survey of
Taiwanese adults (including institutionalized individuals)
collected in 1989, 1993, 1996, 1999, and 2000. In 2000, a
subsample of individuals was randomly selected for inclusion
in SEBAS. SEBAS consists of adults aged 54 and older in
2000, with in-home interviews and medical exams taken in
a hospital. For SEBAS, we use individual-level data based on
a sample of 1,020.
The sample averages 66.8 years of age in England, and the
US and Taiwan mean age is about the same (Table 1). There
are more men in Taiwan (56%) and England (53%) and fewer
in the US (44%).
2.2. Measures. We examine the following indicators of phys-
iological dysregulation often associated with obesity and
also associated with increased risk for multiple adverse
health outcomes and obesity [43, 44]: (1) cardiovascular
markers: high systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure
(DBP); (2) metabolic markers: high levels of blood lipids
(total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and
fasting triglycerides), low levels of high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol, and high fasting glucose and glycated
hemoglobin; (3) high levels of inflammatory markers C-
reactive protein (CRP; available in NHANES and ELSA) and
interleukin-6 (IL-6; available in SEBAS), as CRP and IL-
6 have been positively associated with BMI [35]. For each
indicator we use clinical cutpoints or widely used research-
based cutpoints to indicate high levels of risk which are shown
in Table 1 [39, 43, 45].
There has been debate as to the best indicator of
obesity: body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference.
Waist circumference is thought to be a better measure
of abdominal adiposity than BMI and a better indicator
of risk of poor health outcomes, including all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality [46, 47]. For this reason we combine
the two indicators in our investigation. We investigate the
association between BMI and biomarkers across categories
of BMI (underweight <18.5 kg/m2, normal and overweight
18.5­29.9 kg/m2, obese 30­34.9 kg/m2, and very obese
35 kg/m2) and waist circumference categorized as normal
or high waist (high waist: men 120 cm, women 88 cm).
We create a composite measure of obesity and adiposity by
categorizing individuals into five groups: (1) underweight and
normal waist (all underweight individuals had a normal waist
circumference), (2) normal/overweight BMI (termed normal
BMI) and normal waist circumference (reference group),
(3) normal/overweight BMI (termed normal BMI) and high
waist circumference (termed high waist), (4) obese and high
waist (all obese individuals had a high waist circumference),
and (5) very obese. We also evaluate an alternate definition for
obesity in Taiwan based on BMI 27, as it has been suggested
by some that obesity levels should be differentially defined for
Asians [48, 49]. A similar composite measure of obesity and
adiposity was calculated using this alternate definition of BMI
in Taiwan.
Because these risk factors are all assumed to be associated
with obesity and because dysregulation in multiple physio-
logical systems has been shown to predict many of the poor
health risk outcomes associated with aging, we also create
two summary measures of risk based on the total number
of at-risk levels of biomarkers, either 9 or 8 [50]. Because
CRP values for SEBAS are not available, this measure is not
included in the 9-item summary measure for Taiwan, but
a summary measure (range 0­9) was calculated for Taiwan
using IL-6, another indicator of inflammation, instead of
the CRP values included for the US and England. A second
alternate summary measure of biological risk, excluding the
inflammatory marker (range 0­8), was examined for all three
countries. Biological risk summary scores were computed
for individuals who had missing values on no more than 3
biological markers.
We examine multiple covariates in our investigation of
the relationship between obesity and biological risk. Self-
reported use of antihypertensives was determined in all three
countries, and use of lipid-lowering statins was only asked in
the US sample. Dichotomous variables were created to indi-
cate whether the respondent reported being a current smoker
and participating in at least moderate physical activity for
exercise (e.g., brisk walking, running, or swimming) in the
past 30 days (for the US and England) or generally exercising
once a week (for Taiwan).
2.3. Statistical Analysis. We use logistic regression models
to determine the odds of having at-risk levels of a specific
biomarker for obese men and women among the three
4 Journal of Obesity
populations. For all countries, the comparison group for BMI
and waist circumference is the normal BMI and normal
waist group. The regressions included indicators of age, use
of antihypertensives, current smoking status, and having
exercised in the past 30 days. Ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression models were used to determine the relationship
between the summary measures of biological risk and the
composite measure of obesity and adiposity. The OLS models
were run with the same covariates as the logistic regression
models.
3. Results
Level of Physiological Dysregulation. We begin by examining
national differences in the high risk levels of individual
biomarkers (Table 1). Elevated blood pressure is more preva-
lent in Taiwan than in England or the US. Low levels--or
high risk levels--of HDL cholesterol are also more common
in Taiwan. High total and LDL cholesterol is more common
among the English; lower levels of plasma glucose, CRP, and
glycated hemoglobin are also characteristic of the English.
Few adults in England have elevated levels of fasting glucose
(2.2%), while this is observed in 17.3% and 13.2% of American
and Taiwanese adults.
Levels of BMI and Waist Circumference. In all countries, most
people in this age range are in the normal to overweight
category (64.7%, 67.2%, and 89.4% in the US, England, and
Taiwan, respectively) (Table 2(a)). Americans are more likely
to be obese (33.7%) compared to the English (32.1%) and
Taiwanese (7.2%). Among the obese, Americans are much
more likely to be very obese: 13.4% of the total US sample,
10.1% in England, and about 1% in Taiwan. Both among the
obese and very obese, the average BMI is higher in the US
and England compared to Taiwan. Few are underweight in
any country (1.7%, 0.8%, and 3.4% in the US, England, and
Taiwan, resp.).
When we examine waist circumference, the US has the
highest average waist circumference, with 65.5% of Amer-
icans, 55.9% of English, and 15.8% of Taiwanese having
a high waist size (Table 2(a)). This means that high waist
characterizes a substantial number of those who would be
categorized as normal weight in the US and England. Among
those in the normal and overweight group about half (49.5%)
of Americans and a third (36.4%) of the English have high
waist (Table 2(b)). Almost all obese individuals have a high
waist in the US and England (98.3% in the US and 96.5% in
England), but only 78.4% of the obese in Taiwan also have
a high waist. When we use the alternate obese cutpoint of
27 kg/m2 in Taiwan, less than half of the obese individuals
have a high waist (not shown here).
Values of Control Variables. Americans exhibit the highest
proportion of the older population taking antihypertensive
medication (47.1%) (Table 1). The percentage who reports
taking antihypertensives is lower in England (32.0%) and
Taiwan (28.6%). Americans are more likely to be current
smokers (24.5%) than persons in Taiwan (22.5%) and Eng-
land (13.9%). More than half of the population in all countries
report having exercised in the past 30 days, with more English
exercising (82.2%) compared to Taiwan (61.4%) and the US
(58.5%).
Links between Obesity and Physiological Dysregulation. Men
with normal BMI and high waist have a greater likelihood
than men with normal BMI and normal waist size of having
high-risk levels of triglycerides in all three countries. In
the US and England, men with high waist are more likely
to have high levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and higher
CRP; fasting glucose is also elevated among this group in
the US (Table 3(a)). Men who are obese in the US have
fewer elevated risk factors than those with high waist who
are not obese; in the US, obese men are only more likely
than normal weight men without high waist to have elevated
glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose and CRP. Taiwanese
obese men also have elevated glycated hemoglobin and
high triglyceride levels. English men who are obese have
more elevated risk: both blood pressure indicators, HDL
cholesterol, triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin, and CRP.
Very obese men in England have the same elevated risk
factors with the exception of DBP. Very obese men in the US
are more likely to have elevated fasting glucose in addition to
CRP and glycated hemoglobin.
Results for women were somewhat different. English and
Taiwanese women with normal weight and high waist are
more likely to have elevated SBP, DBP, and glycosylated
hemoglobin; only British women with higher waist have
significantly elevated triglycerides and only the Taiwanese
women had more HDL risk. High risk CRP is more common
among both American and English women with normal BMI
and high waist, and this risk of elevated CRP is also higher
in the obese and very obese (Table 3(b)). Obese women in
Britain had elevations in the same markers as normal BMI
and high waist English women, while obese women in the
US only have elevated fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin,
and CRP; obese women in Taiwan only had high DBP. With
the exception of Taiwan, levels of the inflammatory markers
(CRP in the US and England; IL-6 in Taiwan) are more likely
to be elevated among persons with a high waist and normal
BMI, obese or very obese, compared to their normal BMI and
normal waist counterparts.
Among men, an increase in the biological risk summary
score (range 0­9) is associated with having a high waist
relative to being of normal BMI and normal waist in all
three countries (Table 4(a)). Being obese or very obese is
also related to a higher biological risk summary score (0­9)
for men in the US and England. Generally, the size of the
associated increase is larger with increasing weight. These
equations explain 6 to 11 percent of the variance in the
summary indicator of biological risk. These relationships are
similar for women (Table 4(b)), with one exception: obese
Taiwanese women do not have a significantly increased
biological risk compared to their normal weight and normal
waist counterparts.
When we consider the alternate summary score that
excludes our indicators of inflammation (range 0­8), being
obese or very obese is no longer associated with a higher
biological risk summary score in US men compared to men

with a normal BMI and normal waist when controls for health
behaviors and medication use are included (Table 5(a)). The
size of the effects of the obesity categories is reduced on the
8-indicator summary measure in both England and the US,
indicating the strong link between CRP and obesity. The 2
is also reduced in these equations for England and the US.
For Taiwan, the 8 and 9 category measures yield very similar
results.
Women in England and Taiwan, but not women in the
US, with a higher waist but who are not obese have signifi-
cantly higher physiological dysregulation compared to their
normal BMI and normal waist counterparts. Obese women
in all three countries have elevated risk and the very obese
have even higher risk (Table 5(b)). The alternate biological
risk summary measure (0­8) yields different relationships
between weight and physiological dysregulation in the US
and Taiwan. In the US, only very obese women have a higher
alternate biological risk summary score (0­8). In Taiwan,
obese and normal BMI and high waist women exhibit higher
alternate biological risk summary scores compared to their
normal BMI and normal waist counterparts, except when
smoking status, physical activity, and use of hypertensives are
included.
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) illustrate the predicted alternate
biological risk score (0­8) for each weight category for men
and women (respectively) aged 65 who are nonsmokers, do
not engage in physical activity, and are currently taking anti-
hypertensive medication. Equations in Tables 5(a) and 5(b)
are the basis of this estimation. This figure allows for country
comparisons of individuals with these characteristics within
each weight category and across weight categories. Generally,
increases in weight categories correspond to an increase in
biological risk score. The effect of weight appears to be largest
among Taiwanese men. Across countries, the predicted values
indicate that the US has the highest biological risk score
within each respective weight category among men and
women of the same age and lifestyle behaviors. With the
exception of women in the normal BMI and high waist group,
England has the second highest biological risk score within
each weight category, followed by Taiwan. Among 65-year-
old women with the noted lifestyle behaviors and with a
normal BMI and high waist, Taiwan has a slightly higher
biological risk score than England.
When we consider the alternate BMI cutpoint for obesity
in Taiwan (BMI  27 kg/m2), our findings for the individual
biomarkers and summary measures of biological risk are
similar to using the BMI  30 kg/m2 cutoff for Taiwan except
that the category normal weight with high waist no longer
differs from the omitted category (results not shown).
4. Discussion
This study observes three general findings about how bio-
logical risk is associated with obesity in three countries that
differ in lifestyle and culture. First, obesity is associated
with physiological dysregulation in all countries with differ-
ences in the links between specific indicators of biological
risk and obesity. Generally, obesity in England is associ-
ated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and elevated glycated
hemoglobin; Americans who are obese are not more likely to
have hypertension. In Taiwan, obese women are more likely
to have elevated DBP and obese men have an increased risk
of elevated triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin compared
to their nonobese, normal waist counterparts. Our biological
risk summary scores indicate that at all levels of weight
physiological dysregulation was highest in the US, followed
by England (with one exception), with Taiwanese exhibiting
the lowest biological risk in all groups among the three coun-
tries. Second, these relationships remain after controlling for
demographic factors, participation in physical activity, and

other behavioral factors. Third, similar to obese older adults,
high waist individuals with normal BMI also exhibit greater
physiological dysregulation in all countries compared to their
normal BMI and normal waist counterparts. This dysregula-
tion appears to be largest in Taiwan. There are, however, noted
gender differences across the countries. Obesity in US men
appeared to have a somewhat smaller effect on physiological
dysregulation.
The country differences in the links between obesity
and biological risk are particularly interesting. Our finding
of a higher physiological dysregulation, as shown by the
alternate biological risk summary score, in Taiwan compared
to the US and England could be due to a couple of potential
explanations. First, it may be due to differences in the years
lived with obesity. The prevalence of obesity in the US
and England is much higher than in Taiwan, indicating an
earlier initial rise in obesity relative to Taiwan. From 1978
to 2002, the proportion of obese Americans and Britons
exhibited stark increases (13­32% and 6­23% for men and
women, resp.) [26]. The estimates for obesity prevalence in
Taiwan indicate a recent increase for men but not women.
From 1993­1996 to 2000-2001, the age-adjusted prevalence
of obesity rose from 10.5% to 15.9% for men and declined
from 13.2% to 10.7% in women [51]. It may be that the lower
levels of risk among older adults who have lived longer years
with obesity could be a reflection of better pharmacologic
control of physiological dysregulation (e.g., through statin
use), which may in turn confer less biological risk in these
populations compared to populations of currently obese Tai-
wanese adults who may have more recently begun living with
obesity.
A second reason for the observed country differences
in obesity may be due to differences in dietary habits and
lifestyle. The US and England are two modern, Western
populations whose diets have been influenced by increased
industrialization and have over time come to be characterized
by high glycemic loads and high fatty acid composition
[52]. Taiwan, on the other hand, represents a country that
has experienced the effects of the industrial and scientific
revolutions later than that of the US and England but is
currently rapidly undergoing economic development and
demographic change. The recent economic changes in Taiwan
may indicate that obese older adults in Taiwan have more
recently begun to consume high-fat diets, which could result
in greater initial physiological dysregulation associated with
access to Western-influenced dietary habits.

Despite controlling for lifestyle behaviors thought to be
linked with health, the country differences in obesity and
physiological regulation remain. Moreover, the consideration
of antihypertensives does not alter our substantive conclu-
sions on these associations. This suggests that despite the
greater use of medications to treat hypertension in the US,
obesity among Americans is associated with greater overall
biological risk than the other two countries. This is supported
by findings from the general population of Americans relative
to England, which report that the US is faced with greater
health disadvantages than England in adulthood [36] and
across the life span [38].
We also note differences in biological profiles of obese
individuals between the two Westernized countries: the US
and England. The excess risk of hypertension associated
with obesity in England was not found in the US. These
differences may be due to the higher use of medications
among Americans compared to the English, with about
16% more men and 18% more women in the US aged
65+ taking antihypertensive medication compared to their

British counterparts [53]. The greater use of hypertensive
medications in the US is also noted when compared to Japan
and countries across Europe [53].
Two notable differences in country patterns of the rela-
tionship between obesity and physiological dysregulation by
sex are found. Among men in England and Taiwan, the order
of magnitude of physiological dysregulation increases with
higher weight categories; however, this is not observed for US
men. This difference may be due to our inability to consider
statin use in England and Taiwan, which may be particularly
important in the relationship between obesity and physio-
logical dysregulation for men. Conversely, the importance of
considering statin use may be less vital to understanding the
country differences in the association between obesity and
physiological dysregulation among women, given that the
relationship for women is more consistent across countries,
namely in the US and England.
Differences in underweight and physiological dysregula-
tion are also observed. In US women, underweight corre-
sponds with higher biological risk (though nonsignificant)

compared to women with normal BMI and normal waist.
Underweight among men in Taiwan is significantly associated
with much lower biological risk than their normal BMI
and normal weight counterparts. Further studies will be
required to explore possible explanations for these differences
in physiological dysregulation.
The higher biological risk observed among normal BMI
and high waist individuals relative to normal BMI and normal
waist older adults builds upon previous studies that report
on alternate indicators of body shape, which vary across
countries [54]. The importance of waist circumference is
underscored by our current study, as well as a growing body
of literature on the predictive value of waist circumference
on indicators of health. Higher rates of diabetes among older
Americans compared to Britons have been accounted for
by high waist circumference as opposed to BMI differences
[30]. Additionally, increasing waist circumference is more
predictive of greater risk of incident diabetes than BMI in
middle-aged British men ([55] and the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam
study [56]). Waist circumference, as an indicator of central
fat mass, is thought to be more strongly associated with
disease risk, and in our case with physiological dysregulation,
compared to BMI, which is considered a cruder index
of adiposity. Banks and colleagues [30] cite differences in
physical activity, diet and greater psychosocial environmental
challenges in America compared to England as potential
mechanisms linking central adiposity and type 2 diabetes.
Our study considers some of these possible mechanisms (e.g.,
physical activity and antihypertensive use) but finds that they
explain little of the relationship between biological risk and
adiposity among the three countries. Together, these results
highlight the importance of considering waist circumference
in investigating the links between indicators of health and
adiposity. They also support the need for identifying addi-
tional mechanisms that explain these relationships.
Our finding of the biological risks associated with obesity
among older Taiwanese adults underscores the growing
concern for risks associated with obesity in countries rapidly
undergoing modernization. In comparing the biological risk
of obese individuals among the three countries, we are able
to use these international comparisons to our advantage
to examine how differences in modernization influence the
health of older adults in different populations. This may
have potential health policy implications that underscore the
importance of addressing and controlling the rising obesity
epidemic that has become most widespread in countries,
like the US and England, that have long experienced high
economic growth and in countries currently undergoing
rapid economic development. The increasing use of biological
information to inform our understanding of health repre-
sents an innovative method in biodemography that will fur-
ther contribute to the testing of current comparative theory
and the potential creation of new paradigms surrounding the
influence of modernization on health.
There are a number of principal strengths of the current
study. First is the use of a broad range of biological markers
across three large-scale population surveys. The inclusion
of biological information as objective precursors of health
allows, to some extent, a fairly comparable comparison of
indicators of health across the different populations. An
exception to this uniform comparison of biomarkers across
the three surveys is our use of inflammatory marker CRP in
the US and England and our inclusion of a different marker
of inflammation (IL-6) in Taiwan. Of note, CRP seems to
be more strongly associated with obesity than IL-6. Second,
our study considers two indicators of obesity: BMI and
waist circumference. A growing body of literature has made
Journal of Obesity 11
distinctions between BMI and waist circumference, namely,
suggesting that waist circumference is a better indicator of
abdominal obesity, which in turn has been associated with
obesity-related health risks. Our findings generally report a
similar association between increased biological risk and (1)
normal BMI and high waist and (2) obese and high waist.
Using the US NHANES, [57] reported that when both waist
circumference and BMI were included in their analyses, only
waist circumference was a significant predictor of comorbid-
ity. Although this and other studies have suggested that waist
circumference may be a better indicator of obesity and risk for
adverse health outcomes, our study finds the two indicators
to be similarly associated with biological risk across the three
countries.
We note some limitations of the current study. First, we
examine population-based data from three countries at a
single time point. This limits our ability to distinguish among
age-period-cohort effects. Future studies of longitudinal data
will allow for further investigations of the potential role of
obesity on biological risk observed in the current associa-
tions. Second, we do not have measures of some lifestyle and
medical behaviors for some of the datasets (e.g., statin use),
which likely influence the relationship between obesity and
biological risk. As such, we are unable to include such factors
in our analyses of all three countries. It is possible that these
lifestyle behaviors are key explanatory factors to the noted
cross-country differences in obesity-related biological risk.
The cross-country differences in the relationship between
increased biological risk for individuals who are obese and
have a high waist underscore potential differences in health
and lifestyle behaviors. These behaviors may be a result of
country differences in economic development that we are
not able to observe in this study. The country differences
in the links between obesity and physiological dysregulation
are particularly marked when comparing obesity among
Taiwanese older adults relative to Westernized populations,
such as the US and England. Further examination of these
relationships over time and across other countries will
contribute to our understanding of the potential factors
responsible for these country-specific variations in biological
risk, as obesity becomes increasingly more prevalent and
older adults in various countries live more years with obesity
and increased adiposity.
