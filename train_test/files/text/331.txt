in children: the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Study III

Abstract
Background--An increase in the preva-
lence of obesity and asthma over recent
decades has been reported in aZuent
societies. Both overweight and obesity
have been shown to be inversely related to
having been breastfed, which is also a
potential protective factor against child-
hood atopic diseases. The aim of this
analysis was to explore the relation of
body mass index (BMI) to asthma and
atopy in a large representative sample of
the United States population.
Methods--Children aged 4­17 years were
included in the NHANES III survey. Preva-
lences of atopic diseases and potential con-
founding factors such as exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke, birth
weight, breast feeding, and household size
were assessed using structured interviews
with parents. Height and weight were
measured, and BMI was calculated as
kg/m2 and transformed into Z scores. Chil-
dren underwent skin prick tests for atopy to
a battery of food and inhalant allergens.
Results--The prevalence of asthma (8.7%
v 9.3% v 10.3% v 14.9%, p=0.0001) and
atopy (48.6% v 50.5% v 53.0% v 53.2%,
p=0.05) rose significantly with increasing
quartiles of BMI. After adjustment for
confounders, a significant positive associ-
ation between BMI and asthma remained
(adjusted OR 1.77, 95% confidence inter-
val 1.44 to 2.19 between the highest and
lowest quartiles of BMI), whereas no
independent relation between BMI and
atopy was evident. No eVect modification
by sex or ethnic group was seen.
Conclusions--The eVects of increased
BMI on asthma may be mediated by
mechanical properties of the respiratory
system associated with obesity or by
upregulation of inflammatory mecha-
nisms rather than by allergic eosinophilic
inflammation of the airway epithelium.

An increase in the prevalence of obesity over
recent decades has been reported in Britain
and the United States.1 The simultaneous rise
in the prevalence of asthma and atopy2 has
prompted investigators to speculate that obes-
ity might be a causal factor in the inception of
atopic diseases. In fact, several studies (most of
them cross sectional) have shown positive
associations of obesity or body mass index
(BMI) with respiratory symptoms, asthma, and
airway hyperresponsiveness.3­10 Little is known
about the potential eVects of BMI on the
development of atopy. While some studies have
found an eVect of BMI on skin test reactivity6
and the prevalence of allergy,9 others have
failed to find an association between BMI and
hay fever5 or self-reported allergy.7 In studies
stratified according to sex, associations of BMI
with respiratory symptoms and lung function
have been more pronounced in women and
girls than in men and boys.5 7 10 Inner city
populations may be at a higher risk than
residents of suburban or rural environments.3 8
A strong inverse relation between having
been breast fed and BMI has recently been
found in children starting school,11 confirming
previous reports based on smaller study
samples.12 13 Since breast feeding is also a pro-
tective factor against asthma and atopy,14
uncontrolled confounding may have biased the
results of previous studies.
The Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) explored
the nutritional and health status of a stratified
random sample of a non-institutionalised US
population aged 6 months to 74 years.
Information was obtained on BMI, breast
feeding status, prevalence of asthma and hay
fever, and atopic sensitisation as assessed by
skin prick tests.
Methods
The NHANES III survey, which was con-
ducted in two phases (1988­91 and 1991­4),
included a total of 39 695 subjects aged 2
months to >80 years. For the purpose of this
report, data analysis was restricted to children
aged 4­17 years (n=7505). Details of the
survey design and the examination procedures
have been published previously.15 Interviewers
visited the subjects at home before the medical
examination to gather demographic infor-
mation and elicit a medical history. For the

Interviewers and medical examiners were spe-
cifically trained to ensure standardisation of the
conduct of the survey at each site.
To assess the prevalence of asthma, subjects
were asked whether a physician had ever told
them they had asthma, whether they still had
asthma, and whether they had ever been
treated by a doctor for asthma. The number of
episodes of wheeze in the past 12 months, the
number of hospital and emergency room visits,
the number of hours the subject watched TV
on the day before examination, and the
frequency of play or exercise resulting in
sweating and breathing hard per week were
ascertained. Moreover, exposure to environ-
mental tobacco smoke--that is, cigarette smok-
ing by anyone in the household--was deter-
mined. For children aged 4­6 years,
information on breast feeding status (whether
they had ever been breastfed) and the duration
of breast feeding was collected.
Height and weight were measured and BMI
was calculated as kg/m2. Z scores of BMI were
furthermore computed as suggested for the
NHANES III data set (CDC NHANES
website: www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/
nhanes/growthcharts/datafiles.htm). Skin prick
tests were performed in 6­17 year old subjects
at the time of the medical examination by
teams of technicians trained in standardised
procedures. A panel of allergens, including
Alternaria, bermuda grass, rye grass, ragweed,
Russian thistle, white oak, cat, German cock-
roach, mites, and peanuts was administered.
Histamine and phosphate buVered saline con-
trols were also applied. Skin tests were
performed on an alcohol prepared arm by
applying drops of allergen and then pricking
the skin under the drops by lifting it lightly with
a 25 gauge BD needle. After 20 minutes the
length and width of the flare and weal were
measured. A reaction was defined as positive if
the mean of the length and the width of the
weal was at least 3 mm (with the reaction to the
negative control subtracted from that to the
respective allergen). Children with a positive
reaction to any of the 10 allergens tested were
considered atopic.
Data were analysed by multiple linear and
logistic regression, using generalised models
for intraclass correlation to adjust for random
site eVects and normalised weighting of data to
adjust for the sampling scheme in NHANES
III.
Results
The characteristics of the study population are
given in table 1. The three ethnic groups that
made up most of the study sample (non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and
Mexican Americans) were represented in simi-
lar proportions. Approximately half of all
subjects were atopic, while 9% had had asthma
at some time. Mean BMI was 18.5 kg/m2
(range 7.3­37.2; 1st quartile 7.3­15.4; 2nd
quartile 15.5­17.1; 3rd quartile 17.2­20.4; 4th
quartile 20.5­37.2). The prevalence of asthma,
wheeze in the past 12 months, hay fever, and
atopy rose significantly with increasing BMI
(table 2).
Having been breastfed was found to be
inversely related to BMI as reported previ-
ously.11 After adjustment for potential con-
founding factors such as age, sex, ethnicity,
household size, and exposure to passive smoke,
a significant positive association between BMI
and the asthma outcomes remained (table 3).
Additional controlling for birth weight (which
was assessed only in children <12 years of age)
or breast feeding status (which was assessed
only in children <6 years of age) did not change
the results (data not shown). With stratification
for ethnicity and sex, no eVect modification for
the relation between BMI and asthma was seen
(data not shown). When other measures such
as waist circumference, arm circumference,
and thigh skinfold were used as indicators of
obesity, similar results were obtained (data not
shown).

Atopic sensitisation, as assessed by skin prick
tests, was only weakly and non-significantly
positively related to BMI after adjustment for
confounding. With further controlling for birth
weight the association disappeared (data not
shown). Moreover, in non-asthmatic children,
BMI was not related to hay fever and atopy
(data not shown). Finally, no significant associ-
ation of BMI with serum eosinophil counts was
seen (table 3). When the association between
asthma and BMI was further adjusted for
atopy, the eVect of BMI remained virtually
unchanged (data not shown). No interaction
between atopy and BMI was found.
No relation between BMI and the number of
episodes of wheeze in the past 12 months was
found (table 3). However, the number of emer-
gency room visits because of asthma was posi-
tively related to BMI. Among asthmatics only,
BMI was inversely associated with the number
of episodes of wheeze but not with the number
of emergency room visits because of wheeze
(data not shown). Time spent watching TV
was not related to asthma ( =0.03, p=0.4) or
atopy ( =­0.03, p=0.1), and the frequency of
exercising per week was also not associated
with asthma (data not shown).
Discussion
A high BMI was associated with an increasing
prevalence of asthma in a representative sample
of the US population aged 4­17 years after
controlling for potential confounding factors
such as sex, ethnicity, age, household size, pas-
sive smoke exposure, birth weight, and breast
feeding status. No eVect modification by sex or
ethnic group was seen. In contrast, atopy was
not related to BMI. The lack of correlation
with television viewing hours or frequency of
physical exercise suggests that it is obesity per
se, and not lack of exercise, that is the issue.
The cross sectional design of this study does
not allow an assessment of the timing of expo-
sure in relation to the occurrence of asthma or
atopy. Thus, the relation between BMI and
asthma may reflect the predisposition of an
asthmatic subject to gain weight because of
reduced exercise tolerance rather than a causal
association between a high BMI and the incep-
tion of asthma. However, no association
between the number of episodes of wheezing in
the past 12 months and BMI was found. In
addition, longitudinal data for adults suggest
that increases in BMI predict the development
of asthma in nurses16 and in children.17 It
therefore seems highly unlikely that asthma
leads to obesity.
Increasing BMI was related to several meas-
ures of asthma, but not to atopy assessed as
skin test reactivity. A lack of association
between eosinophil counts and BMI suggests
that the eVects of increased BMI may be medi-
ated through factors other than the induction
of allergic eosinophilic inflammation of the air-
way epithelium. An increasing body of litera-
ture suggests that obesity is a proinflammatory
state.18 Studies in animal models indicate that
increased levels of leptin, IL-6, and IL-1 (all
proinflammatory cytokines) may contribute to
and upregulate inflammation in the airway,
independent of an allergic mechanism.18 Stud-
ies of prior National Health and Nutrition
Examination surveys showed that individuals
with a high BMI have increased peripheral
blood leucocyte counts which also may reflect
an upregulation of inflammatory processes.
Mechanical properties of the respiratory sys-
tem associated with obesity, such as diminished
tidal lung expansion in overweight individuals,
may partially account for these results. Re-
duced tidal lung expansion compromises force
fluctuations acting on the airways. Impaired
force fluctuations result in greater contractile
responses of airway smooth muscle,19 thereby
potentially causing increased airway respon-
siveness, a hallmark of asthma. Although
airway responsiveness was not assessed in
NHANES III, a previous study of Taiwanese
adolescents6 clearly showed a positive eVect of
BMI, not only on the prevalence of asthma, but
also on the presence of airway responsiveness
as assessed by methacholine challenge. In the
Normative Aging Study20 physiological studies
suggesting that increases in obesity are associ-
ated with increases in methacholine airway
responsiveness in adults are consistent with the
mechanical impact of obesity on airway smooth
muscle.
A strong association between asthma and
atopy has been found in clinical studies where
over 80% of asthmatic children react to one or
more environmental allergens in skin prick
tests.2 On a population level, however, the rela-
tion between asthma and atopic sensitisation is
much less clear. In some regions of the world,
such as rural China and rural Ethiopia, the

prevalence of asthma is low and is unrelated to
the prevalence of atopy, whereas in westernised
areas the prevalence of asthma is higher and
closely linked to a high prevalence of atopy.21
This discrepancy points to the importance of
distinct factors in determining the incidence of
asthma and atopy.
We showed in a German survey11 that
prolonged breast feeding is a protective factor
against childhood overweight and obesity.
These data have been reproduced in this study
which shows an increased risk of obesity in
children not breastfed for at least 5 months.
Recent studies have suggested a protective role
of breast feeding against asthma.14 22 If pro-
longed breast feeding resulted in less obesity,
then increased BMI might be an intermediate
step in a causal pathway leading from short-
ened nursing to the development of asthma.
However, the results of multivariate analyses
including breast feeding do not support this
notion. Breast feeding was no longer a
significant predictor of asthma once BMI was
introduced into the model. However, this may
be because the intermediate variable (BMI)
was included in the regression.
BMI may therefore be an independent risk
factor for the development of asthma in both
sexes and across ethnic groups. Appropriate
strategies for the reduction of body weight in
children may contribute to a reduced incidence
of asthma in childhood.
