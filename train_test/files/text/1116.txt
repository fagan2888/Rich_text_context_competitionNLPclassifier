Objective: Touseethnicallydiverse,nationaldatatoex-
amine longitudinal trends in race/ethnic disparities in 20
leadinghealthindicatorsfromHealthyPeople2010across
multiple domains from adolescence to young adulthood.
Much of what is known about health disparities is based
oncross-sectionalmeasurescollectedatasingletimepoint.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationally rep-
resentative data for more than 14 000 adolescents en-
rolled in wave I (1994-1995) or wave II (1996) of the Na-
tionalLongitudinalStudyofAdolescentHealth(AddHealth)
and followed up into adulthood (wave III; 2001-2002). We
fit longitudinal regression models toassess and contrastthe
trend in health indicators among racial/ethnic groups of
adolescents as they transition into adulthood.
Main Outcome Measures: Diet, inactivity, obesity, to-
baccouse,substanceuse,bingedrinking,violence,sexually
transmitteddiseases,mentalhealth,andhealthcareaccess.
Results: Diet, inactivity, obesity, health care access, sub-
stanceuse,andreproductivehealthworsenedwithage.Per-
ceived health, mental health, and exposure to violence im-
provedwithage.Onmosthealthindicators,whiteandAsian
subjects were at lowest and Native American subjects at
highest risk. Although white subjects had more favorable
health in adolescence, they experienced greatest declines
by young adulthood. No single race/ethnic group consis-
tently leads or falters in health across all indicators.
Conclusions: Longitudinal data indicate that, for 15 of
20 indicators, health risk increased and access to health
care decreased from the teen and adult years for most US
race/ethnic groups. Relative rankings on a diverse range
of health indicators (and patterns of change over time)
vary by sex and race/ethnicity, causing disparities to fluc-
tuate over time.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE
large and persistent racial, eth-
nic, and socioeconomic dispari-
ties in health across the life
course,1-3 with increasing eco-
nomic and racial inequality.4,5 The reduc-
tion and ultimate elimination of health dis-
parities has been identified as a major
public health goal,6,7 exemplified by
Healthy People 2010, the nation's promo-
tion and disease prevention strategy for the
first decade of the 21st century.8
McGuiness and Foege9 have described
the major external (nongenetic) modifi-
able factors contributing to death in the
United States. Tobacco use and poor diet/
inactivity emerged as the 2 leading causes
of preventable death in the United States,
with alcohol abuse, motor vehicle crashes,
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), fire-
arms, and illicit drug use also impor-
tant.9,10 Leading health indicators from
Healthy People 2010 with known dispari-
ties in prevalence8 include sexually trans-
mitted disease,10-12 illicit drug use,10,13-15
asthma,16,17 lack of access to medical
care,18-20 and dental care.21
Health disparities research largely pro-
vides snapshots of health disparities at a
single point in time or for a series of cross-
sectional comparisons of different co-
horts born at different times. The major
contribution of our research is that we fol-
low up the same cohort of ethnically di-
verse adolescents for 6 years into young
adulthood to track change in disparities
in health risk over time. We specifically
examine 8 of 10 leading health indicators
identified in Healthy People 2010 that are
particularly relevant to young people.7,8
Measures include health indicators re-
lated to diet and inactivity, obesity, to-
bacco use, substance use, STDs, mental
health, violence, and access to health care.
METHODS
SURVEY DESIGN
The National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-
cent Health (Add Health) cohort is a nation-
ally representative school-based study of youths
(grades 7-12), followed up with multiple in-
terview waves into young adulthood. The study

used a multistage, stratified, school-based, clustered sampling
design. A stratified sample of 80 high schools (and feeder middle
schools) was selected with probability proportional to size. Sur-
vey procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board
of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and have
been previously described.22 Wave I (1994-1995) included
20 745 adolescents (aged 12-19 years) and their parents. Wave
II (1996) included 14 738 wave I adolescents (including school
dropouts and excluding graduating seniors). Wave III (2001-
2002) included 15 170 wave I adolescents, now aged 18 to 26
years and entering the transition to adulthood (76% response
rate).23 Total bias owing to attrition rarely exceeds 1%, which
is small relative to the 20% to 80% prevalence rates for most of
our measures.23-26
SAMPLE
We used repeated measures of health indicators, restricting the
sample to respondents interviewed at wave I or wave II and at
wave III (depending on the measure) with valid data at both
time points. When race/ethnic disparity in each measure is
tracked from waves I through III, more than 14 000 subjects
(7538 females and 6725 males) participated; from waves II
through III, more than 10 000 subjects (5719 females and 5069
males) participated. In all analyses, we used wave III sampling
weights and survey analysis techniques to adjust for unequal
probability of selection, clustered sampling design, and attri-
tion to ensure national representation of US teens on enroll-
ment rosters for grades 7 through 12 in 1994-1995.23,27,28
MEASURES
To provide a comprehensive picture of the major health con-
cerns of our nation, we include a range of measures that cap-
ture 8 of 10 leading health indicators of Healthy People 20108
and that were particularly relevant to young people.
Health Habits
Diet indicators include the number of days the respondent ate
breakfast and fast foods in the past 7 days (waves II and III).
Physical activity is reported using a standard physical activity
behavior recall that is similar, although not identical, to other
self-report questionnaires that have been used and validated
in other large-scale epidemiological studies.29,30 Wave III mea-
sures were scaled to be equivalent to those at wave II.31 Lack
of exercise is defined by self-report of no bouts of moderate to
vigorous physical activity (5-8 metabolic equivalents) per week
(waves II and III).
Obesity is defined using body mass index (BMI; calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in me-
ters) from the measured height and weight at waves II and III.
To deal with the discrepant obesity definitions for adolescents
and adults, the International Obesity Task Force reference is
used. This reference links childhood and adolescent BMI cen-
tiles to the adult BMI cut point of 30 to determine obesity preva-
lence at wave II.32 For the young adult population at wave III
(aged 19-26 years), we consistently use the adult BMI cut point.
Measures have been described in detail elsewhere.33
Health Care
The following health care measures (waves I and III) are di-
chotomous indicators reflecting lack of care: (1) whether the
respondent had current health insurance; (2) whether the re-
spondent needed but did not receive medical care in the last
year; (3) whether the respondent needed but could not afford
dental or medical care last year; (4) whether the respondent
visited a dentist in the last year; and (5) whether the respon-
dent had a physical examination within 2 years.
General Health
Self-reported health is measured as a dichotomous indicator
indicating fair or poor relative to good or excellent health.
Asthma (parental report in wave I and self-reported asthma di-
agnosis in wave III) is measured as a dichotomous indicator.
Substance Abuse
All measures of substance abuse are self-reported from waves
I and II and reflect (1) smoking at least 1 whole cigarette daily
during the last 30 days; (2) any use of marijuana in the past 30
days; (3) any use of hard drugs such as cocaine, inhalants, or
injected or other illegal drugs in the past 30 days in wave I, and
any use of cocaine, injected or other illegal drugs, or crystal
methamphetamine in wave III; and (4) binge drinking, de-
fined as 5 or more drinks (ie, glass of wine, can of beer, wine
cooler, shot glass of liquor, or mixed drink) on 1 occasion dur-
ing the past year.
Reproductive Health
Our only measure of reproductive health is self-reported STD
diagnosis (chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immuno-
deficiency virus/AIDS, genital herpes, genital warts, and tricho-
moniasis for both sexes, and bacterial vaginosis and vaginitis
for female subjects) at waves II and III.
Mental Health
We have the following 2 indicators of mental health at waves I
and III: feelings of depression (feeling depressed a lot, most,
or all of the time last week) and suicide ideation (the respon-
dent has seriously thought about suicide in the past 12 months).
Violence
Exposure to violence in the past year is measured across the
following items at waves I and III: (1) victim of violence who
has been shot, stabbed, beat up, jumped, or threatened with a
gun or a knife, and (2) perpetrator of a violent act who has pulled
a knife or gun on someone or shot or stabbed someone.
Race/Ethnicity
Five race and ethnic groups were used based on self-identified
race and Hispanic origin at wave III. In the largest sample, tracked
from waves I through III, the sample includes non-Hispanic
white (n = 7728), non-Hispanic black (n = 3038), non-
Hispanic Asian (n=1021), Hispanic (n=2340), and Native
American (n=136) subjects.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We selected a marginal (or "population-average") longitudi-
nal regression model to estimate temporal change in each health
indicator; the hypotheses under investigation were best an-
swered by examining the average experience of each race/
ethnic group rather than by examining person-specific vari-
ables. Separate models were run for male and female subjects.
Covariates used to predict each health indicator in the model
included race/ethnic group, time, and the interaction between

race/ethnic group and time. Nonsignificant interaction terms
were omitted from the final model. We hypothesized that (1)
each race/ethnic group experienced no change in the health in-
dicator over time, and (2) the rate of change in the health in-
dicator for each nonwhite race/ethnic group was equal to the
rate of change in the health indicator for the white group. To
determine if the significant differences in the trend in health
over time could be explained by socioeconomic status (SES),
median tract income and maximum parental education were
included in each of the final models, but had minimal influ-
ence on estimates of variables and made no difference in the
tests of the hypotheses. Hence, we report results for the mod-
els that omitted these 2 covariates.
RESULTS
Across all sex and race/ethnic groups, there were signifi-
cantincreasesinhealthriskandhealthdisparitiesfromado-
lescence into young adulthood. There were statistically sig-
nificant increases over time in the proportion who get no
exercise or report asthma, significant declines in breakfast
consumption,andsignificantincreasesforalmosteverysex
andrace/ethnicgroupintheproportionofrespondentswho
were obese, needed but could not afford medical care, used
cigarettes and marijuana, had any STDs, or reported binge
drinking, all indicating increasing health risk during the
transition from adolescence to adulthood (Table 1). Re-
ductions in risk were found in the significant declines over
timeacrossalmostallsexandrace/ethnicgroupsinthepro-
portion who perceived their health as poor to fair, had feel-
ings of depression or suicidal ideation, and were a victim
of violence. All groups (except black and Native Ameri-
can male subjects) had significant declines in perpetrat-
ing violent acts.
The race/ethnic groups shift in their position as
occupying the best or worst ranking across the various
health indicators over time. No single race/ethnic group
consistently occupies the best or worst ranking. The
tendency was for Asian and non-Hispanic white sub-
jects to generally rank best across time and across mul-
tiple domains of health risk, whereas the other minority
groups ranked worst (Table 2 and Table 3). How-
ever, white subjects lose their favored position more
often than other groups as they age into adulthood.
Native American subjects tended to appear in the worst
rankings most often, followed by non-Hispanic black
subjects, with Hispanic subjects in the middle range
across most indicators.
Selected illustrative results are presented in Figure 1
and Figure 2 by category of health indicator. The full
set of figures for male and female subjects in all 20 lead-
ing health indicators can be found at http://www.cpc.unc
.edu/projects/addhealth/findings.
HEALTH HABITS AND HEALTH CARE
There was a significant increase in the proportion of over-
weight/obese adolescents and those engaging in no weekly
physical activity (female subjects shown in Figure 1A and
B). The trend lines fan out, indicating increasing disparity
in young adulthood, highest among black vs white sub-
jects. The proportion of respondents with no health insur-
ancecoverageincreasedsignificantlyformostgroups(male
subjects shown in Figure 1C). The proportion with the last
physical examination more than 2 years ago (Figure 1D)
also increased significantly for most male subjects, with in-
creases for Hispanic and Native American subjects pro-
portionately greater than those for white subjects.
GENERAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, SUBSTANCE
USE, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, AND VIOLENCE
Self-reports of poor health (male subjects in Figure 2A)
and feelings of depression (female subjects in Figure 2B)
declined significantly as adolescents aged into young
adulthood, and race/ethnic disparities decreased as well.
Smoking (Figure 2C) and binge drinking (Figure 2D) in-
creased significantly for all groups, with increasing dis-
parity over time and greatest disadvantage among white
subjects. Diagnosis of STDs increased significantly in the
transition to adulthood for all groups, with increasing race/
ethnic disparity over time (Figure 2E). Violence de-
clined significantly over time for all groups, with de-
creasing race/ethnic disparity (Figure 2F).
The overall patterns of health disparities include sig-
nificantly different trends for black relative to white fe-
male subjects across almost all domains. Among male sub-
jects, the black-white disparity in trends is significant for
more than half of the indicators. For both sexes, the white-
Hispanic disparity in health trends is significant for 35%
of the indicators. Patterns of change in health indicators
are similar for white and Asian subjects, and greater among
male than female Native American compared with white
subjects.
COMMENT
To our knowledge, this research is the first to present lon-
gitudinal, nationally representative data on race/ethnic
disparities in leading health indicators across the tran-
sition to adulthood. The fact that we can follow up the
same individuals longitudinally to examine changes in
these health risk behaviors, specifically the placement of
these changes in the context of health disparities, is a ma-
jor contribution of this research.
For 15 of 20 indicators, health risk increased across
all race/ethnic groups during the transition to adult-
hood. Relative rankings on a diverse range of health in-
dicators (and patterns of change over time) varied by sex
and race/ethnicity, causing disparities to fluctuate over
time. Asian and white subjects generally scored highest
across the range of health indicators; Hispanic subjects
scored within the moderate range; and Native American
and non-Hispanic black subjects scored the lowest. Al-
though white subjects had more favorable health risk in
adolescence, they experienced the greatest decline by
young adulthood.
For most of the health indicators showing increased
health risk over time, race/ethnic disparities in these in-
dicators also increased. Although the disparities in-
creased, different race/ethnic groups occupied more and
less favored positions over time, indicating that no single
common approach to reduce disparities is possible given

risk across time. Documenting race/ethnic disparities in
health indicators is essential in understanding risk and
formulating preventive strategies to tackle these impor-
tant behavioral/health concerns.34-37 Furthermore, re-
search needs to move beyond race/ethnicity to under-
stand the underlying causes of health disparities in the
United States.38

race/ethnic groups varies across studies.2,39 Our analyti-
cal models suggest no changes in race/ethnic disparities
over time with controls for SES. Thus, factors beyond in-
come and education may play a role in the cause of these
health trends. Furthermore, SES may be related to the
starting point on our health indicators in adolescence,
but not to the trends in these indicators over time. It is
also possible that we do not capture the complexity of
the SES-health relationship across the transition from
adolescence to young adulthood. For example, as
teens leave their parental homes, they are likely to lose
health insurance coverage owing to aging out of Med-
icaid coverage or leaving their parents' health insur-
ance coverage.
The top 3 leading actual causes of death in the year
2000 were (1) tobacco use, (2) poor diet and physical
inactivity, and (3) alcohol consumption.10 We found dra-
matic increases in behaviors related to these 3 leading
causes of death. As adolescents become young adults, they
are more likely to eat fast food, get no exercise, be obese,
and smoke cigarettes. Binge drinking (the most com-
mon pattern of alcohol abuse40) increased among male
and female subjects (except black and Native American
subjects). These findings underscore the importance of
ongoing preventive efforts related to smoking, poor diet
and physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption early
in the life course.
As adolescents aged into young adulthood, an increas-
ing proportion had no current health insurance, did not
receive health care when they needed it, and did not get
regular dental or physical examinations (male but not fe-
male subjects, likely due to the entrance into prime child-
bearing age). Race/ethnic disparities increased in the need
for but inability to afford medical care, further exacer-
bating race/ethnic disparities in health19,20 and poten-
tially leading to increased mortality.18

that shows increasing prevalence of asthma, particularly
among minorities.16,17 Diagnosis of STDs increased over
timewithsubstantialrace/ethnicdisparity(highestforblack
subjects). Similarly, the proportion using marijuana and
hard drugs (male subjects) increased over time, with in-
creasing race/ethnic disparity in marijuana use (highest
for white subjects). The trends in prevalence of STDs and
illicit drug use prompts concern owing to the association
of these health indicators with increased mortality risk.9
Onthepositiveside,feelingsofdepressionandsuicidal
ideation decreased over time (particularly for black sub-
jects), and differences among the race/ethnic groups de-
clined. It is possible that this co-occurrence could, as the
literature shows, influence other health risk behaviors,
such as a range of STD/human immunodeficiency virusÂ­
associatedsexualactivity,41 substanceabuse,15 tobaccouse,42
and obesity.43 Similarly positive was the reduction in vic-

We included measures of 8 of the 10 leading health
indicators highlighted in Healthy People 20108 salient for
young people (not included are measures of environ-
mental quality and immunization). Although these are
admittedly a broad array of health indicators that repre-
sent several different health constructs, they are impor-
tant indicators reflecting major health concerns in the
United States at the beginning of the 21st century.8 Fur-
thermore, the meaning of health risk may change from
adolescence to young adulthood (eg, sexual behavior may
be considered more risky in adolescence than young adult-

hood). Another limitation is our use of the standard race/
ethnic categories, which may mask important race/
ethnic heterogeneity within these groups.
Our findings indicate a strong and unprecedented de-
cline in health during the transition to young adulthood
in the current generation. Although we have no point of
reference to compare these findings with those for other
generations, the within-cohort trends indicate deterio-
ration in health behaviors. As this cohort is followed up
in adulthood, the assessment of morbidity and mortal-
ity outcomes associated with this increased health risk
will be possible. Shifts in health profiles are part of our
epidemiological history when, for example, during the
demographic transition a mortality pattern of malnutri-
tion and infectious disease shifted to one of high preva-
lence of chronic and degenerative diseases associated with
urban-industrial lifestyles44 and into a period of delayed
degenerative diseases, a major shift in age-specific mor-
tality patterns, and a consequent increase in life expec-
tancy.45 Furthermore, evidence suggests that life expec-
tancy gains have dropped in recent decades.46
One finding of major concern is the fact that young
US adults are engaging in a range of health risk behav-
iors that puts them at increased risk of future adverse
health outcomes. Our findings have serious implica-
tions for the present and future health of this genera-
tion. We find substantial race/ethnic disparities in health
that vary depending on the measure. Because our find-
ings show great variability in the levels, relative rank-
ings, and changes in race/ethnic disparities, policies to
reduce race/ethnic disparities in health require com-
pletely different actions for each health indicator. Atten-
tion must be paid to national efforts to reduce and ame-
liorate these preventable conditions, particularly in light
of national health objectives for reducing race/ethnic dis-
parities in leading health indicators.
