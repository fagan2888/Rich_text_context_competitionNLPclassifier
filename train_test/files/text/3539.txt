Abstract
Objective: Acute organ embolism in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) has
been reported, but changes in coagulation are unclear. This study aimed to investigate changes in
coagulation in children with MPP.
Methods: A total of 185 children with MMP (cases) and 117 healthy children (controls) were
recruited. We measured prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT),
thrombin time (TT), and plasma fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer levels.
Results: Plasma FIB (3.39 Æ 0.96 g/L vs 2.93 Æ 0.6 6g/L, t = 4.50) and D-dimer (326.45 Æ 95.62mg/L
vs 263.93 Æ 103.32mg/L, t=5.36) in MPP children were higher than controls and PT (9.54 Æ 4.97S
vs 11.48 Æ 5.96S, t=3.05) and APTT (31.41 Æ 12.01S vs 38.38 Æ 11.72S, t=4.95) were shorter than
controls. FIB, D-dimer, PT, and APTTwere not different between the high IgM-titre and low-titre
groups. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves in cases and controls for
plasma FIB and D-dimer levels were 0.654 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.593­0.716, P ¼ 0.031)
and 0.682 (95% CI, 0.619­0.744, P ¼ 0.032), respectively.
Conclusions: Children with MPP have a higher risk of blood coagulation and thrombosis.
Controlling these problems should be considered as soon as possible.

pneumonia (CAP) in children.1­3 Some
studies have reported that MPP might
account for as many as 40% of CAP cases,
nearly 20% of which require hospitaliza-
tion.1,4 The pathogenesis of MP is complex.
The main cytotoxic effects of MP include
local disruption of tissue and cell structure
along the respiratory tract epithelium. MP
produces the community-acquired respira-
tory distress syndrome toxin, which most
likely aids in leading to inflammation and
airway dysfunction. Formation of some viru-
lence factors, such as lactoferrin, hydroxyl
radicals, superoxide anions, and hydrogen
peroxide, aggravate tissue damage. The
immunological responses by MP may cause
other systemic symptoms.5
MPP is usually characterized by a per-
sistent dry cough and fever, and is con-
sidered as a mild and self-limited disease that
is cured with no medication. Nevertheless,
even when MMP is treated with macrolide
antibiotic in a timely manner, severe pul-
monary and extra-pulmonary complications
may lead to respiratory failure and hypoxia.
These complications can develop into severe
life-threatening pneumonia in some severe
cases.6­10 Clinicians need to identify severe
and complicated MPP at earlier stages.
Other severe complications that have been
identified from fulminant MPP cases include
acute organ embolism and infarction, such
as carotid artery embolization and cerebral
infarction. The majority of acute cerebral
infarction cases have occurred in children
with MPP in recent years.11­20 Pulmonary
embolism and paediatric femoral artery
thrombosis have also been reported in chil-
dren with MMP.21­23 These studies also
showed that there were coagulation abnorm-
alities in children with MPP.
Blood coagulation might be abnormal in
cases of MP infection and blood coagulation
abnormalities can cause embolization.11­23
Studies have shown that some cases of
MMP show coagulation abnormal-
ities.12,13,17,19 A girl with MPP and acute
cerebral infarction was reported in Weifang
Hospital in 2011, whose FIB and D-dimer
levels in blood were significantly higher than
normal.15 The relationship between MP
infection and embolization is still unclear.
Few multiple-case studies have reported
changes in coagulation in children with
MPP.14,18 In this study, we performed a
case­control study to analyse the changes in
coagulation in children with MPP.
Materials and methods
A case­control study was conducted in
Weifang People's Hospital, Shandong
Province, China from January, 2011 to
December, 2014. All children who had symp-
toms and signs indicative of pneumonia, such
as fever, cough, abnormal lung auscultation,
and a new infiltrate on chest radiograph, were
admitted to the Department of Paediatrics
and tested for mycoplasma by samples of
throat swabs within 3h by a quick method
(MP 3h Culture Identification Kit, Wuhan
Showtime Technology Co., Ltd). This study
was approved by the ethics committee of
Weifang People's Hospital (No: P2010019).
All of the parents of the children who
participated signed an informed consent form.
All of the children with pneumonia
who had MP-positive throat swabs had a
5-ml sample of venous blood collected
using IMPROVACUTER EDTA K2 tubes
(Improve Medical Technology, Guangzhou,
China) before treatment. During 60min after
collection, blood samples were centrifuged
at 2000r/min for 10min in a BY-320 C
centrifuge (Baiyang Medical Instrument
Company, Beijing, China) and the plasma
was immediately separated. Indices of coagu-
lation, including prothrombin time (PT),
activated partial thromboplastin time
(APTT), thrombin time (TT), and plasma
fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer levels were
detected in 2 h. The coagulation test and
plasma D-dimer kit were from Mitsubishi
Chemical Corporation. Detection was

performed using the ACLTOP700 automatic
blood coagulation analyser (Beckman
Coulter). Other clinical indices, such as
C-reactive protein (CRP) (IMMAGE 800
Turbidimetric Inhibition Immunoassay
System; Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA,
USA), platelet (PLT) count (XE-2100
Automated Hematology System; Sysmex,
Kobe, Japan), and the erythrocyte sedimen-
tation rate (Westergren's blood sedimenta-
tion tube; Hull Medical Science and
Technology Co., Ltd., Hefei, China), were
analysed by routine methods.
After approximately 2 weeks of symp-
toms, all of the children with pneumonia and
MP-positive throat swabs had 2 ml of venous
blood collected using IMPROVACUTERÕ
EDTA K2 tubes. Blood samples were cen-
trifuged at 2500r/min at room temperature
for 10min in a BY-320 C centrifuge (Baiyang
Medical Instrument Company) and the
plasma was immediately separated, frozen,
and stored at À80C until later analysis. IgM
antibody was detected by a diagnostic kit for
measurement of antibodies to MP according
to the manufacturer's instructions (passive
particle agglutination test, Serodia-Myco II;
Fujirebio Inc., Japan).
Patients who were MP IgM-positive and
had an antibody titre ! 1:160 were selected
as cases. Cases were divided into two sub-
groups: the low-titre group with an MP IgM
titre equal to 1:160­320 and the high-
titre group with an MP IgM titre equal to
1:640­1280. Healthy children without MPP
were selected as controls from the Health
Evaluation Clinic at the same hospital
during the study period. Similarity of sex
and age between the children with MMP
and healthy children was considered when
the healthy children were selected. Samples
of venous blood to detect MP IgM antibody
and four indices of coagulation and plasma
D-dimer levels were also collected. The IgM
antibody of controls needed to be negative
(IgM titre < 1:40). All of the children in
the case and control groups had a routine
clinical examination. Sex, age, medical his-
tory, and laboratory data were recorded by
clinical doctors. Children with other respira-
tory tract infections and tuberculosis,
rheumatic diseases, haematological diseases,
and immunodeficiency were excluded from
the case and control groups. Children who
took some medicine or other substances that
affect the blood system were also excluded.
SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,
USA) was used for statistical analysis.
Continuous data are shown as mean Æ
standard deviation (x Æ s). All continuous
data were tested for normality and homo-
geneity of variance. Analysis of variance or
the Student's t-test was used to determine
differences in continuous variables among
the groups. The Student­Newman­Kueuls
(SNK) method was used to identify signifi-
cant differences between group means.
Categorical data are shown as frequencies.
Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact
test was used to analyse differences between
categorical variables. P < 0.05 was desig-
nated as the level of statistical significance.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis was used to further assess differ-
ences in coagulation between children with
MMP (cases) and controls. The areas under
the curves (AUCs) were calculated.
Results
Basic characteristics of the study subjects
A total of 185 children with MPP-positive
antibody (IgM antibody titre ! 1:160) were
selected as cases and 117 healthy children
(IgM antibody titre < 1:40) were recruited as
controls. The age and sex of the control
group were 8.3 Æ 1.6 years and 53/74,
respectively. There were no significant differ-
ences in age and sex between cases and
controls (P ¼ 0.18 and P ¼ 0.16, respect-
ively). The number of children in the two
subgroups was 88 in the low-titre group and
97 in the high-titre group y. Table 1 shows the
clinical characteristics of children with MPP.

Coagulation function and D-dimer values
in cases and controls
Plasma FIB and D-dimer levels in cases were
higher than those in controls (P < 0.001
respectively). The PT and APTT in cases
were shorter than those in controls
(P = 0.002 and P < 0.001 respectively). The
TT was not different between cases and
controls (Table 2).
Multiple comparisons of coagulation
function and D-dimer levels
Plasma FIB and D-dimer levels in the high-
titre group were significantly higher than
those in controls. The PT and APTT in the
high-titre group were significantly shorter
than those in controls. Plasma FIB and
D-dimer levels in the low-titre group were
higher than those in the control group.
There were no differences in the PT and
APTT between the low-titre group and the
control group. There were no differences in
plasma FIB and D-dimer levels, PT, and
APTT between the low-titre group and the
control group (Tables 3 and 4).
ROC curve analysis
The ROC curves of plasma FIB and
D-dimer levels for discriminating the case
group from the control group were analysed.
The AUC for plasma FIB levels was 0.654
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.593­0.716,
P ¼ 0.031). The AUC for plasma D-dimer
levels was 0.682 (95% CI, 0.619­0.744,
P ¼ 0.032) (Figure 1).

and the PT and APTT. We found that
children with MPP had higher plasma FIB
and D-dimer levels, and a shorter PT and
APTT than did healthy children. These
findings indicated that children with MPP
were more likely to have blood coagulation
and a higher risk of thrombosis. There were
no differences between the high-titre MP
antibody group and the low-titre group.
FIB is a glycoprotein in blood, and is
synthesized in the liver by hepatocytes and
helps in formation of blood clots.24 FIB can
form bridges between platelets, by binding
to their GpIIb/IIIa surface membrane pro-
teins. FIB deficiency or disturbed function
of FIB can lead to either bleeding or
thromboembolic complications.25 FIB can
function as a cofactor in aggregation of
platelets, and an increase in FIB indicates
easier blood agglutination. An increase in
plasma FIB levels is always identified in
various diseases, such as diabetes, preg-
nancy-induced hypertension, acute neph-
ritis, and cancer. An increase in plasma
FIB levels can also be found in infectious
diseases and has a major effect on the
coagulation system. Nevertheless, few stu-
dies have focussed on an increase in FIB
levels in children with MPP.
D-dimer is a specific degradation product
that is produced in hydrolysis of fibrin,
which is regarded as an important indicator
of hyperfibrinolysis. Detection of D-dimer is
able to reveal early thrombotic disease and
reflect generation of thrombin and plasmin.
Plasma D-dimer levels are a specific marker
of the fibrinolysis process in the clinic.
D-dimer is often elevated in many diseases,
such as disseminated intravascular coagula-
tion, venous thrombosis, coronary heart
disease, severe infection, tissue necrosis,
and colorectal cancer.26 D-dimer levels are
also closely related to the inflammatory
response and may reflect the effects of
infection on coagulation in infectious dis-
eases. Some studies have reported that
plasma D-dimer levels are significantly
increased in children with acute MPP,
which suggests that blood is in a hypercoa-
gulable state and the presence of throm-
bosis.27 A study in Taiwan reported that
MP-infected adults were in a hypercoagul-
able state and had a high risk of stroke
through 5 years of observation among more
than 1000 cases of MP infection.28
There have been many reports on MPP
with acute cerebral infarction or hemiplegia,
most of which were cases of MMP in
children.11­23 However, the cause of abnor-
mal coagulation function and thrombosis is
not fully understood.29 Some authors con-
cluded that cytokines and mycoplasma

infection produced damage to the vascular
wall, leading to local vasculitis and throm-
botic vascular occlusion.30,31 Some studies
have shown that activation of the comple-
ment system caused by mycoplasma acti-
vates the coagulation system.32 In fact,
MP infection activates exogenous and
endogenous coagulation systems by multiple
pathways, resulting in abnormal coagula-
tion and promotion of thrombosis.
Vascular endothelial cells are damaged by
MP, and this leads to an imbalance in
coagulation and anticoagulation factors.
Some inflammatory factors, such as tumour
necrosis factor-a and interleukin, accelerate
coagulation.33 When liver cells are damaged
by inflammation, synthesis of some antic-
oagulation factors, including antithrombin
III (AT-III) and protein C, are affected, and
this also leads to promotion of coagulation.
AT-III levels and protein C activity are
significantly different in MP-infected children
compared with health children,34 and after
anti-mycoplasma treatment, protein C activ-
ity returns to normal. In vitro experimental
studies have suggested that lipoglycans from
some mycoplasma can induce procoagulant
activity through human mononuclear cells.35
Many studies have reported that blood
coagulation function in children with MP
infection and venous or arterial thrombosis
return to normal after anticoagulant ther-
apy.36,37 Additionally, after this therapy,
antiphospholipid antibodies disappear and
anti-clotting factor activity normalizes.36,37
Treatment of children with MPP should be
considered for controlling thrombosis
according to mechanisms of thrombus due
to MP infection. Thrombolytic therapies
should be considered as soon as possible
when clinical circumstances arise.38
There are several limitations in the study.
First, this study was performed in only
one hospital. The representativeness of the
sample should be considered when the con-
clusions are generalized. Second, the findings

in this study should be confirmed by studies
with a large sample size. Finally, there may
have been some unknown factors that
affected the results because of the complexity
of MPP.
