Abstract:
What is the role of contracting schemes for the welfare costs of nominal rigidities over
the business cycle? We examine 4 different modeling schemes of nominal rigidities that
all have the same average duration of contracts. We find that Calvo (1983) wage and price
contracts may deliver welfare costs that are 3-4 times higher than Taylor (1980) contracts.
However, that result is sensitive to the monetary policy rule. We discuss the implications
of modeling capital mobility and of adopting the Mankiw and Reis (2002) sticky infor-
mation scheme for the welfare costs of nominal rigidities.

Non technical summary
Nominal rigidities are at the heart of New Keynesian models, but they can be modeled
in many different ways. The contribution of this paper is to analyze the role of wage
and price contracting schemes for the welfare costs of nominal rigidities. Most monetary
models adopt the scheme of Calvo for introducing nominal stickiness. Despite its popu-
larity, the scheme has unappealing properties. There exists a set of firms that almost never
adjust their prices. Some firms are forced to retain prices arbitrarily far away from the
optimal price, which can influence the welfare implications in an unreasonable way.
We compare the following models of nominal rigidities. Contract adjustment of
Calvo, a truncated version of that scheme, N period overlapping contracts as in Taylor
and a more general scheme with time varying adjustment probabilities as suggested by
Wolman. All of these schemes imply that the welfare cost of nominal rigidities stem from
the dispersion of differentiated goods across producers or of differentiated labour across
workers.
Our main findings is that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities are very sensitive to
the particular way in which these rigidities are modeled. The costs of these rigidities may
vary from roughly 0.05 to roughly 0.3 of one per cent of consumption in each period.
We find that Calvo contracts may imply much higher welfare costs of nominal rigidities
than schemes with a narrower support of the intervals between price or wage changes
but equal mean. In the baseline parameterization of the model, Calvo contracts give rise
to welfare costs of nominal rigidities that are more than 3 times as high as for Taylor
contracts. However, the finding that Calvo contracts imply higher welfare costs is not
general. Calvo contracts may also imply similar welfare costs over the business cycle than
Taylor contracts depending on the monetary policy rule. The intuition for this result is as
follows. When the age distribution has larger support as in Calvo vs. Taylor contracts,
there are some agents that charge prices set farther in the past. Their contract price tends to
be more out of line with current economic conditions. While that effect typically increases
the welfare costs, those agents setting prices today will look farther into the future and
also charge a price that reflects less on current economic conditions. The overall effect on
price dispersion and therefore welfare is ambiguous.
We perform two robustness checks. We explore how the welfare costs of nominal
rigidities depend on the existence of an economy-wide rental market for capital and on
introducing rigidities via the sticky information scheme of Mankiw and Reis. We show
that imposing firm specific capital has two opposite effects on the welfare costs of nomi-
nal rigidities that may be largely offsetting. A given amount of relative price dispersion is
more costly in welfare terms since there is more dispersion of labour across firms. How-
ever, specific capital makes firms more reluctant to changes prices, since marginal cost
now depends on the price they charge. Hence, there is less price dispersion in equilib-
rium.
We then assume as in Mankiw and Reis that some agents must choose their contract
based on outdated information sets and vary the age distribution of information sets as
we did in our earlier analysis with contract ages. When restricting the ability to obtain
current information rather than directly restricting the ability to reset contracts, we find
that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities are typically very small: ranging from 0.01 to
0.06 of one per cent of consumption.

Nominale Rigidit¨
aten sind essentiell f¨
ur Neu Keynesianische Modelle. Diese Rigidit¨
aten
k¨
onnen jedoch auf vielerlei Weise modelliert werden. Der Beitrag dieses Papiers liegt
darin, die Rolle von Lohn- und Preiskontrakten f¨
ur die Wohlfahrtskosten von nominalen
Rigidit¨
aten zu analysieren. Die meisten monet¨
aren Modelle folgen dem Calvo Ansatz zur
Modellierung von Preiskontrakten. Trotz seiner Popularit¨
at hat dieser Ansatz problema-
tische Eigenschaften. Bei diesem Ansatz gibt es eine kleine Menge von Firmen, die fast
nie den Preis anpassen. Diese Firmen sind gezwungen einen Preis zu setzen, der nahezu
willk¨
urlich weit weg vom optimalen Preis liegt. Diese Eigenschaft des Calvo Ansatzes
k¨
onnte die Wohlfahrtsimplikationen der Neu Keynesianischen Modelle in unplausibler
Weise beeinflussen.
Dieses Papier vergleicht die folgenden Modelle von nominalen Rigidit¨
aten: Kontrakt-
anpassung nach Calvo, eine "gestutzte" Version dieses Schemas, ¨
uberlappende Kontrakte
nach Taylor und einen allgemeineren Ansatz mit zeitvariierenden Kontraktanpassungs-
wahrscheinlichkeiten nach Wolman. Bei allen diesen Modellierungsans¨
atzen lassen sich
die Wohlfahrtskosten von nominalen Rigidit¨
aten darauf zur¨
uckf¨
uhren, dass die unter-
schiedlichen G¨
uter oder Arten von Arbeit in gesamtwirtschaftlich ineffizienter Menge
eingesetzt werden.
Als wesentliches Resultat dieser Analyse l¨
asst sich feststellen, dass die Wohlfahrts-
kosten von nominalen Rigidit¨
aten sehr stark davon abh¨
angen, wie diese Rigidit¨
aten mo-
delliert werden. Die nominalen Rigidit¨
aten sind mit Wohlfahrtskosten verbunden, die -
je nach gew¨
ahltem Modellierungsansatz - zwischen circa 0,05 und circa 0,3 Prozent des
Konsums in jeder Periode variieren. Calvo-Kontrakte k¨
onnen sehr viel h¨
ohere Wohl-
fahrtskosten implizieren als Kontraktschemata mit einer anderen Verteilung der Intervalle
zwischen den Kontrakt¨
anderungen, aber gleicher durchschnittlicher Kontraktdauer. In
der grundlegenden Kalibrierung des Modells sind die Kosten der nominalen Rigidit¨
aten
bei Calvo- Kontrakten dreimal so hoch wie bei Taylor-Kontrakten. Allerdings ist dieses
Ergebnis nicht allgemeing¨
ultig. Calvo-Kontrakte k¨
onnen, je nach der geldpolitischen
Regel, auch Kosten in ¨
ahnlicher H¨
ohe wie Taylor-Kontrakte hervorrufen. F¨
ur dieses
Resultat mag folgende Intuition hilfreich sein. Wenn die Altersverteilung von Preiskon-
trakten breiter wird, wie beim ¨
Ubergang von Taylor- auf Calvo-Kontrakte, dann gibt es
einige Firmen, deren ¨
altere Preise weniger die gegenw¨
artigen ¨
okonomischen Bedingun-
gen reflektieren. Dieser Effekt erh¨
oht typischerweise die Wohlfahrtskosten der nominalen
Rigidit¨
aten. Anderseits ¨
andert sich auch das Preissetzungsverhalten derjenigen Firmen,
die heute die Gelegenheit haben, den Preis anzupassen. Diese Firmen schauen weiter in
die Zukunft und setzen einen Preis, der auch weniger die gegenw¨
artigen ¨
okonomischen
Bedingungen reflektiert. Insgesamt ist der Effekt auf die Verzerrung relativer Preise und
damit die Wohlfahrt nicht eindeutig.
Das Papier nimmt zwei Robustheitsanalysen vor. Es wird erstens untersucht, wie
die Wohlfahrtskosten der nominalen Rigidit¨
aten von der Existenz eines Marktes f¨
ur die
Allokation von Kapitalg¨
utern zwischen den Firmen abh¨
angen. Zweitens wird gepr¨
uft,
welche Auswirkung die Annahme teilweise veralteter Informationsmengen bei Preis- und
Lohnsetzung im Sinne von Mankiw und Reis auf die Wohlfahrtskosten hat.
Die Annahme, dass Kapitalg¨
uter vollkommen firmenspezifisch sind, hat zwei un-
terschiedliche Auswirkungen auf die Wohlfahrtskosten von nominalen Rigidit¨
aten. Ein
gegebenes Ausmaß der Verzerrung relativer Preise bewirkt h¨
ohere Wohlfahrtskosten, weil
nun der relative Arbeitseinsatz zwischen den Firmen st¨
arker verzerrt wird. Allerdings
nimmt die Verzerrung relativer Preise tendenziell ab, weil Firmen nun weniger starke
Preis¨
anderungen vornehmen. Dies liegt daran, dass die Grenzkosten der Produktion bei
firmenspezifischem Kapital von der Produktionsmenge der einzelnen Firma und damit
von ihrem eigenen Preis abh¨
angen. Folglich gibt es im Gleichgewicht eine geringere
Verzerrung der relativen Preisen.
Es wird als n¨
achstes angenommen, dass die Individuen ihre Kontrakte auf der Ba-
sis teilweise veralteter Informationsmengen festlegen. Die Altersverteilung der Informa-
tionsmengen wird dann in derselben Art und Weise variiert wie vorher beim Kontrakt-
alter. Es stellt sich heraus, dass Restriktionen auf die Informationsmengen zu wesentlich
kleineren Wohlfahrtskosten der nominalen Rigidit¨
aten f¨
uhren als direkte Restriktionen
auf die Kontraktanpassung. Diese Kosten variieren nun nur noch zwischen 0,01 und 0,06
Prozent des Periodenkonsums.

The Role of Contracting Schemes for the Welfare Costs of
Nominal Rigidities over the Business Cycle1
1 Introduction
The welfare costs of business cycle fluctuations have been an important topic for macroe-
conomic research since the seminal paper by Lucas (1987). Lucas (2003) focused on the
variability of consumption and has argued that the costs of cyclical fluctuations are very
small, roughly 0.07 percent of steady state consumption. Recently, a number of studies
have employed new Keynesian monetary models with sticky prices and wages to find that
the welfare costs could be much larger. Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2004) show that
the costs of nominal inertia may be 20-60 larger than the costs of consumption variability
computed by Lucas (2003).
Nominal rigidities can be modeled in many different ways in New Keynesian models.
The contribution of this paper is to analyze the role of wage and price contracting schemes
for the welfare costs of nominal rigidities.2 Most monetary models adopt the scheme
of Calvo (1983) for introducing nominal stickiness. Despite its popularity, the scheme
has several unappealing properties. Collard and Dellas (2005) point out that "a well-
known but unfortunate feature of this scheme is that there exists a non-zero set of firms
that almost never adjust their prices". Similarly, Bergin and Tchakarov (2003) note that
"under Calvo pricing, some firms are forced to retain prices arbitrarily far away from
the optimal price, which can influence the welfare implications in a way viewed by some
as unreasonable". The main contribution of this paper is to compute the welfare costs
of nominal rigidities across several popular modeling devices for stickiness in nominal
contracts. In doing so, we address an issue identified by Woodford (2003), who writes
that " to deal with other, possibly more realistic distributions of intervals between price
changes, is an important topic for future research."
This paper is motivated by recent work of Kiley (2002) and Ascari (2004) These
authors find that Calvo (1983) contracts imply much larger dispersion of output across
firms in the steady state induced by trend inflation and therefore lower steady welfare than
Taylor (1980) contracts of equal average duration. An important and natural question is
whether the use of the Calvo (1983) scheme has similar implications for quantifying the

2Roberts (1995) has shown that Taylor (1980) and Calvo (1983) contracts as well as Rotemberg (1982)
quadratic adjustment costs give rise to similar Phillips curves. This does not imply that the welfare costs
of nominal rigidities must be similar, as the Phillips curves are similar only after linearization, whereas
welfare measures take into account some of the nonlinearity of the model.

welfare costs of nominal rigidities over the business cycle rather than in the steady state.
Monetary general equilibrium models that feature steady state inflation often assume that
agents can index their contracts to the trend inflation rate, thereby completely bypassing
the point made in Ascari (2004). It is an open question, to what extent the findings of
Kiley (2002) and Ascari (2004) are also relevant for the costs of nominal rigidities over
the business cycle in an environment without trend inflation or equivalently with full
indexation to the trend inflation rate.
We build on the paper by Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) who analyze welfare in
a model with nominal stickiness in wage and price setting. The models of nominal rigidi-
ties we consider are the following: Random price adjustment of Calvo (1983), a truncated
version of the Calvo (1983) scheme, N period overlapping contracts as in Taylor (1980),
a more general scheme with time varying adjustment probabilities as suggested by Wol-
man (1999) and finally variants of the sticky information scheme of Mankiw and Reis
(2002). All of these schemes imply that the welfare cost of nominal rigidities stem from
the dispersion of differentiated goods across producers or of differentiated labour across
workers. Thus we consider a homogenous family of modeling devices for nominal rigidi-
ties.3 When comparing these schemes we require an equal expected duration over which
newly set contracts or information sets are fixed.4 In such a way no model implies more
exogenous stickiness on average. While this metric is typically assumed in the literature,
it is not the only obvious choice. We also report results when choosing the average age in
a cross-section of contracts as our metric, taking into account recent criticism by Dixon
and Kara (2005) .
The schemes suggested by Taylor (1980), Wolman (1999) all relax at least one un-
pleasant assumption of the Calvo (1983) contracts. Taylor (1980) contracts truncate the
horizon in the expectation formation of price and wage setters, which is infinite in the
scheme of Calvo (1983). Wolman (1999) additionally relaxes the assumption that ad-
justment probabilities are independent of time elapsed since last adjustment. Finally, the
Mankiw and Reis (2002) scheme provides a tractable framework for considering limited
availability of information, often seen as one possible micro-foundation for sticky nomi-
nal contracts.
Our main findings can be summarized as follows. We find that the welfare costs or
nominal rigidities depend very strongly on how these rigidities are modeled. These costs
range from 0.01 of one per cent of period consumption to 0.32 of one per cent, depending
on the monetary policy rule in place and on the particular contracting scheme chosen. We
find that Calvo (1983) contracts may imply much higher welfare costs of nominal rigidi-
ties than schemes with a narrower support of the intervals between price or wage changes
but equal mean. In the baseline parameterization of the model, Calvo (1983) contracts
give rise to welfare costs of nominal rigidities that are more than 3 times as high as for
Taylor (1980) contracts. This supports the view that the use of Calvo (1983) contracts
may influence welfare calculations in a very special way. However, the finding that Calvo
(1983) contracts imply higher welfare costs is not general. Contrary to the results by Ki-
3An often used scheme missing from this comparison is Rotemberg (1982) quadratic adjustment costs.
We do not consider it here, since it does not belong to the family of rigidities that imply dispersion of output
across firms or hours across workers. Furthermore, the derivation of welfare based loss function is not as
easily done as with the other schemes.

ley (2002) for the steady state effects of inflation, Calvo (1983) contracts may also imply
similar or even slightly smaller welfare costs over the business cycle than Taylor (1980)
contracts. The intuition for this result is as follows. When the age distribution has larger
support, there are some agents that charge prices set farther in the past. Their contract
price tends to be more out of line with current economic conditions. While that effect
typically increases the welfare costs, those agents setting prices today will look farther
into the future and also charge a price that reflects less on current economic conditions.
Therefore widening the support of the age distribution as done in the Calvo (1983) scheme
has an ambiguous impact on relative price dispersion and therefore on welfare.
When restricting the ability to obtain current information rather than directly restrict-
ing the ability to reset contracts, we find that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities are
typically much smaller. For all considered monetary policy rules and for all considered
age distributions of information sets, the welfare costs of nominal rigidities are smaller
than the cost of consumption variability computed by Lucas (2003), i.e. less than 0.07 of
one per cent of consumption.
In the final section we perform a robustness check that explores the role of an economy
wide rental market for capital. The absence of a rental market for capital represents a
source of real rigidity identified by Ball and Romer (1990) and Kimball (1995) to be
important for the business cycle analysis of monetary models.We show that imposing
firm specific capital has two opposite effects on the welfare costs of nominal rigidities
that may be largely offsetting. A given amount of relative price dispersion is more costly
in welfare terms since there is more dispersion of labour across firms. However, specific
capital makes firms more reluctant to changes prices, since marginal cost now depends on
the price they charge. Hence, there is less price dispersion in equilibrium. We find that
the relative welfare costs of nominal rigidities across the considered contracting schemes
do not depend strongly on how we model capital.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the setup of the model. In section
3, we describe our alternative wage and price setting schemes. Section 4 collects the
log-linearized necessary conditions for equilibrium and the model's baseline calibration.
Section 5 computes the welfare costs of nominal rigidities for our considered schemes.
In section 6 we take up the aforementioned robustness check. Finally, section 7 briefly
summarizes the findings and concludes. An appendix contains the sensitivity analysis
with respect to key parameters.
2 Model
The model is based on Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000). In particular, capital is
in fixed supply in the aggregate. In the baseline model, we assume that there exists an
economy-wide rental market that allows capital to move freely between firms. This as-
sumption is relaxed in a robustness check. We assume further that subsidies exist that
completely offset the effects of monopolistic competition in the steady state in order to
avoid involved derivations of the loss function that would arise with an inefficient steady
state.5 Finally, following Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) households can fully insure
5Recently Benignio and Woodford (2004) have shown that not assuming the subsidies, the quadratic
welfare criterion used here and the relative weights attached to the elements in that criterion still apply as
3
against the idiosyncracies in income streams arising from nominal wage rigidities. While
this may bias the welfare costs of nominal rigidities, it greatly facilitates the analysis.
2.1 Households
There is a continuum of households with unit mass indexed by h. Households are in-
finitely lived, supply labour Nt
(h) and receive nominal wages Wt
(h), consume final goods
Ct
(h), and purchase state contingent securities Bt
(h). Furthermore, they receive lump
sum transfers Tt
as well as profits t
(h) from the monopolistic retailers and hold nominal
money balances Mt
(h). The utility function is assumed to be separable in consumption,
real money balances and leisure. The representative household's problems is:

The function H(·) depicts the utility flow arising from real money balances, often used
as a shortcut for a more explicit role for money, such as a cash-in-advance constraint. We
assume that the utility from real money balances is arbitrarily small. Following Wood-
ford (2003) we omit the first-order condition for money holdings. Given that the we
model monetary policy as an interest rate rule, this equation merely serves to back out
the quantity of money that supports a given nominal interest rate. Bt
is a row vector of
state contingent bonds, where each bond pays one unit in a particular state of nature in
the subsequent period. The column vector t+1,t
represents the price of these bonds. The
role of the bonds is to allow perfect consumption insurance against labour income risk
stemming from nominal rigidities in wage setting. w
is a wage subsidy used to offset
the steady state effects of monopolistic competition in the labour market. The first order
conditions for consumption and state contingent bond holdings give rise to the standard
Euler equation. Note that consumption is perfectly insured against idiosyncratic labour
income risk and therefore consumption is no longer indexed by h.

long as there are no government purchases. When government purchases are present and not unreasonably
large, the relative weights in the welfare function change only slightly and the output gap must be defined
differently. However, the levels of the weights will increase in the severity of the steady state distortion
no matter whether government purchases are present or not. Since government purchases are absent in our
model, we do not introduce any bias into the analysis of the relative welfare costs of different contracting
schemes by conveniently assuming subsidies, whereas the levels are affected by our assumption.

2.2 Production
Firms in the final good sector produce a homogeneous good, Yt
, using intermediate goods,

Yt

(z). (6)
At
denotes total factor productivity, which follows an exogenous stochastic process. Cap-
ital is freely mobile across firms rather than being firm specific. Firms rent capital from
households in a competitive market on a period by period basis after they observe the ag-
gregate shocks. Firm z chooses Lt

The first order conditions imply that all firms choose the same capital to labour ratio,
therefore marginal cost Xt

2.3 The efficiency gap and monetary policy
In order to compute welfare, it is useful to consider the solution under perfectly flexible
wages and prices. Up to a first-order approximation in log deviations6 flexible price output
is given by:
Y 
t
=
1 + 
 +  + (1 - )
At
. (10)
One can use this equation together with the firm's first-order condition for labour demand,
to derive a key equation for this model. This equation links marginal cost to the output
gap, Yt
- Y 
t
, and the gap between the average marginal rate of substitution between
consumption and labour and the real wage:
Xt
=
 + 
1 - 
+  Yt
- Y 
t
- Lt
+ Ct
- wr
t
. (11)
When there are no nominal rigidities in the labour market, the marginal rate of substitution
between consumption and labour is equal to the real wage and the last term in brackets
vanishes. We then recover the condition from sticky price models that marginal cost is
log-linearly related to the output gap. When prices are perfectly flexible as well, the
marginal product of labour is equal to the real wage, i.e. log marginal cost is zero. It
follows that the output gap is zero.
Monetary policy is assumed to follow an interest rate as suggested by Henderson and
McKibbin (1993) or Taylor (1993). We consider the following functional form that is
often used in the empirical description of central bank behaviour:

haviour.
3 Alternative wage and price setting schemes
There are many different ways in which nominal rigidities can be modeled in New Key-
nesian models. The apparatus of Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996) has emerged as a widely
used standard in the analysis of welfare effects of monetary policy, see e.g. Pappa (2004),
Kollmann (2004), Kollmann (2002), Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) or Rotemberg
and Woodford (1997).
Recently, Ascari (2004) and Kiley (2002) have pointed out that Calvo (1983) pricing
implies much more price dispersion induced by steady state inflation than Taylor (1980)
pricing. Ascari (2004) considers a standard New Keynesian model with trend inflation
and Calvo pricing, where those firms that are not re-optimizing their price cannot adjust
for trend inflation. He computes that a trend inflation rate of 5 % generates a steady state

loss7 of output relative to the zero inflation case of 11.5 % with Calvo (1983) pricing, but
only of 0.5% with Taylor (1980) contracts that have the same average duration over which
prices are expected to be fixed. The reason is that trend inflation translates into much
more price dispersion with Calvo (1983) pricing. We are motivated by these findings to
undertake a systematic quantitative comparison of the welfare effects of monetary policy
over the business cycle across different assumptions about wage and price setting. In
order not to pick up any effects already emphasized by Kiley (2002) and Ascari (2004)
and in keeping with much of the new Keynesian literature, we analyze an environment
with zero trend inflation.
We next turn to the description of the alternative price and wage setting schemes. We
can subsume 4 contracting schemes under the general framework provided by Wolman
(1999). The sticky information schemes requires a separate exposition.
3.1 The general Wolman (1999) framework
Following Wolman (1999), we nest all considered models of price and wage setting as
special cases of the following set-up. Limited ability to reset prices is described by a
vector . The j-th element of that vector is the probability that a firm adjusts its price in
period t, conditional on the previous adjustment having occurred in period t - j. One can
deduce from  a vector , denoting the fraction of firms charging prices set in period t-j.
The Wolman (1999) scheme is very flexible, it encompasses Taylor (1980) overlapping
contracts as a special case and can approximate Calvo pricing for large J.
There are two key differences between the Calvo (1983) price setting scheme and
the scheme proposed by Wolman (1999). The first is that Calvo (1983) has an infinite
tail: for any integer J there is a nonzero fraction of firms that last adjusted their price J
periods ago. In the scheme considered here, J is finite. Furthermore, under Calvo (1983)
pricing the probability that a firm adjusts its price in any given period is independent of
the time elapsed since the previous adjustment. A firm that has not adjusted its price
for say 10 quarters is just as likely to keep the price fixed in period t as a firm that has
last adjusted its price in period t - 1. Both the infinite tail and the constant adjustment
probabilities of Calvo (1983) are often considered to be unrealistic. Nevertheless, the
Calvo (1983) scheme is often used under the implicit assumption that these particularities
do not influence welfare computations by much.
We compare the Calvo scheme for wage and price setting to 3 alternative contracting
specifications. To allow for a fair comparison, we require that the expected lifetime of a
newly set contract is equal across schemes. In such a way, no contracting scheme imposes
more exogenous stickiness on average. Using the general notation above the expected
lifetime of a newly set contract, D, is

We consider overlapping contracts in the spirit of Taylor (1980), a truncated version of
the Calvo (1983) scheme and a more general upward sloping scheme with time dependent
adjustment probabilities following Wolman (1999). We assume that no price or wage is
fixed for longer than 10 quarters. Prices are assumed to be fixed on average for 2 quarters,
while wages are fixed for 4 quarters on average. The choice of these durations is motivated
in section 4. The vectors of adjustment probabilities is depicted in the table 1. In that table
the suffix p refers to price setting and w to wage setting.

Price and wage setting is staggered under each of these schemes. At any point in
time the aggregate price or wage index is determined by the prices of Jp cohorts of firms
or wages of Jw cohorts of households indexed by when they last updated their contract.
Under Taylor pricing there are two cohorts of firms that charge prices lasting for exactly 2
periods. At any point in time half of the prices were determined yesterday and half today.
Similarly for 4 period wage setting. Under the Wolman scheme, the time profile of the
conditional adjustment probability is increasing. This is an ad hoc way of capturing the
notion that the gain from adjusting prices when firms face fixed adjustment costs should
increase the longer prices have not been adjusted. The truncated version of the infinite
horizon Calvo (1983) scheme has a time invariant adjustment probability p
= 0.5 for
price setting and w
= 0.232 for wage setting that applies for periods 1 through 9. 10
periods after last adjustment, all contracts can be renegotiated.
While all contracting schemes imply that the newly set contracts have the same ex-
pected lifetime, the schemes differ with respect to the average time elapsed since last
adjustment (the age8 of contracts) at any given point in time as has recently been pointed
out by Dixon and Kara (2005). Calvo (1983) contracts have the largest average age, Tay-
lor (1980) contracts have the smallest average age. The following two graphs plot the
implied age distribution of wage and price contracts.9
8The average age is defined as follows. Let j
denote the fraction of contracts at any point in time that
were last adjusted j periods ago. The average age is J
j=1
j
j. The j
can be derived from the vector 
via recursions described in Wolman (1999).
9Note that graphs show that the fraction of contracts that is one period old (i.e. newly set contracts) is

equal across schemes. The same fraction of contracts are updated in each period, implying an equal average
expected duration of a newly set contract. This follows from the fact that the average updating frequency is
the inverse of the average duration.
10At any given point in time, the average age of a price (wage) contracts is 2 (4) for Calvo (1983)
contracts, 1.99 (3.54) for the truncated Calvo scheme, 1.84 (2.99) for Wolman contracts and 1.5 (2.5) for
Taylor contracts.

3.2 The log-linearized price and wage setting conditions
In any given period, a firm faces a certain probability of receiving a signal that allows
that firm to reset its price. Firms that do not receive the signal, carry on the prices posted
in the last period and satisfy any demand at that price. Given the vector of adjustment
probabilities , firms compute the probability that the price set today will still be in place
j periods from now, labeled p

. The firms problem is:

One can show that it is not necessary to keep track of the relative quantities of intermediate
goods produced by the different cohorts of firms in order to solve the model. A relation
between aggregate inputs and aggregate output similar to what was pointed out by Yun
(1996) for the case of Calvo (1983) pricing can be derived:

For this pricing scheme it is also possible to show that the price distortion term Dt
can
be ignored for a log-linear analysis around a steady state with zero inflation. One can
log-linearize the price distortion term together with the aggregate price index to show that
^
Dt
= 0, if there is no trend inflation.
10
The wage setting problem is analogous. Given the vector of adjustment probabilities,
households maximize utility through choice of the wage subject to the demand curve
implied by the labour aggregator. Let w
j
denote the probability that a wage set in period
t is still in place in period t + j. The first order condition for the wage can be expressed
in terms of the stationary variable w

The familiar framework of Calvo contracts obtains as a special case of this general
scheme. In particular, Jp =  and the adjustment probability is time invariant j
=
1 - p
, for j = 1, 2, .... Similarly for wage setting, there is a time invariant adjustment
probability w
. One could numerically simulate the economy with Calvo (1983) contracts
by truncating the infinite sums for some large integer Jp and Jw. However, one can exploit
the recursive representation of the infinite geometric sums to obtain the well-known wage
and price Phillips curves.

3.3 A variant of Mankiw and Reiss (2002): Sticky information
We build a N-period version of the sticky information scheme by Mankiw and Reis
(2002). As with Wolman (1999) contracts, the arrival of new information is described
11
by a vector , whose elements are the same as in Table 1 for our earlier analysis. The
generic entry j
denotes the probability that a firm that last updated its information set
in period t - j receives a signal to update the information set in period t. In section 5
the adjustment probabilities referred to the signal to be allowed to change the contract
price. Hence, price setters must choose one price which does well on average over the
weighted future periods. Sticky information firms can change their price in any period.
We can think of the problem of a sticky information agent that receives the most recent
information set as choosing a whole path for the contract wage or price to be applicable
in the subsequent periods unless the agent receives another update of the information set.
Equilibrium sequences for allocations and prices in the model with sticky information
must then satisfy (32), (35) - (40) as well as the following conditions stemming from wage
and price setting. There are Jw cohorts of households11, indexed by how many periods
ago they last received an update of their information set. The first order condition of the
optimal nominal wage chosen by cohort j conditional on the information set at time t - j
and applicable in t denoted with Wt,t-j
is:

4 The key equations and model calibration
In this section, we collect necessary conditions that must be satisfied by equilibrium se-
quences of allocations and prices for the case of Calvo (1983) wage and price setting.
11We assume that sticky information pertains only to the households choice of the nominal wage, not to
the choice of consumption and state contingent bonds.

Upper case letters denote the aggregate of the respective lower case variables. (32)
is the consumption Euler equation. (33) and (34) are the wage and price Phillips curves.
(35) is the log-linearized aggregate production function. (36) is the firm's labour demand
function. (37) is an identity defining the change of the real wage. (38) links marginal cost
to the output gap and the "wage gap". (39) is the monetary policy rule. Finally, the last
equation is the exogenous stochastic process for total factor productivity.
We now turn to the calibration. A time period is taken to be a quarter. The average
duration of newly set price contracts is set to 2 quarters. This number is somewhat smaller
than the average duration in most recent calibrated monetary models12. It reflects survey
evidence by Bills and Klenow (2004) pointing to much more price flexibility in the U.S.
economy than typically assumed in the literature. Bills and Klenow (2004) find that half
of all prices last 5 months or less when excluding temporary sales. For wage contracts
we follow Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2004) and much of the literature and set the av-
erage duration to 4 quarters. A recent micro study by Rich and Tracey (2004) suggests
that U.S. wage contracts last on average 10 quarters, with a significant fraction of con-
tracts negotiated annually. We do not calibrate the average contract duration to the data
for the purpose of comparisons with the existing studies on wage stickiness, that almost
universally assume annual contract duration.
The time preference rate is matched to yield an annual gross real interest rate of 1.03,
i.e.  = 1.03-0.25. The markup is calibrated to 15% in both goods and labour markets,
resulting in  = = 7.66. This value is intermediate in the range employed by other
12For instance, Kollmann (2004), Keen (2004) and Pappa (2004) assume an average duration of 4 quar-
ters.
13
studies. Keen (2004) and Collard and Dellas (2005) set the price markup to 10% while
Kollmann (2004) assumes 20%. Rabanal and Rubio-Ramirez (2005) calibrate a wage
markup of 20%. The labour share in production 1 -  is set to the standard value 0.65.
We assume a Frisch (constant marginal utility of wealth) elasticity of labour supply of 1
3
(implying  = 3), which is in line with most empirical estimates ranging between 0 and
0.5 as surveyed in Blundell and MaCurdy (1999). We set the coefficient of relative risk
aversion  to 2. This is a compromise between experimental evidence by Barsky, Juster,
Kimball, and Shapiro (1997) who find a mean risk aversion of roughly 4 and the value of
1 commonly chosen in RBC models. The exogenous process for technology follows an
AR(1) with autoregressive parameter equal to 0.9. The innovation has standard deviation
equal to 0.00852. Following, Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2004), the standard deviation
of the monetary policy shock is set to 0.0025. Since the welfare costs of nominal rigidities
are highly sensitive to the monetary policy rule in place, we consider 3 different rules. The
reaction coefficients describing these three rules are summarized in Table 2. Rule 1 is our
Table 2: The considered interest rate rules

Rule 1: estimated 0.09 2.13 0.78
Rule 2: estimated, no output gap 0.00 1.90 0.77
Rule 3: Taylor (1993) 0.50 1.50 0.00
estimated on quarterly U.S. data over the sample 1980:1-2004:2.13 We refer to the model
with this monetary policy rule as our baseline model. Rule 2 is an estimated rule where
the response to the output gap is restricted to zero. The reason is that the output gap is
typically only marginally significant or even insignificant and that the adverse welfare
effects of reacting to a wrong measure of the gap can be very large, see Schmitt-Groh´
e
and Uribe (2004). We finally consider the classical Taylor (1993) rule as a prominent
benchmark from the literature.
The model is too stylized to estimate its parameters or rigorously calibrate them to
the data. However, we note that the overall amount of volatility present in the model is
roughly comparable to the data. For instance, the baseline calibration implies that the
standard deviation of consumption and hours worked in the model are 0.017 and 0.012,
respectively. Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2004) report that these numbers are 0.016
and 0.014 in detrended U.S. data. Extensive sensitivity analysis with respect to the key
parameters is documented in the appendix.
13All data is taken from the FRED2 database. The interest rate is the end of quarter federal funds
rate available at http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FEDFUNDS/downloaddata/FEDFUNDS.txt. It
is converted to quarterly decimal rate by dividing by 400. The output gap is constructed as the log differ-
ence between quarterly real GDP and potential real GDP as constructed by the Congressional Budget Office.
The series are available at http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GDPC96/downloaddata/GDPC96.txt
and http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GDPPOT2/downloaddata/GDPPOT2.txt, respectively. In-
flation is constructed as the log of the first difference of the GDP price index available at
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GDPCTPI/downloaddata/GDPCTPI.txt. All data except potential
GDP are seasonally adjusted. All coefficients are significant at standard levels.

5 Welfare costs of nominal rigidities
This section computes welfare costs of business cycle fluctuations stemming from nom-
inal rigidities in wage and price setting. The welfare measure is the expected lifetime
utility of a randomly drawn household. We follow Rotemberg and Woodford (1999) and
assume that utility flow from real money balances is negligible. Define period utility Wt

L gives the onetime increase in consumption, expressed as a percentage of period con-
sumption in the steady state, necessary to make agents as well off in a world with nominal
rigidities as in a world with perfectly flexible wages and prices. Since this loss function is
free of first moments, it can be accurately (up to second-order) evaluated by considering
a linear approximation to the model's equilibrium conditions.
For Calvo (1983) contracts, we have JP = JW =  and we could compute welfare
by truncating at some large integer. Instead we work with the well-known equivalent
representation:

Note that the weight on wage dispersion (~
0
) is roughly 15 times larger than the weight
on price dispersion (~
2
) for our benchmark calibration. The higher weight attached to
wage dispersion depends on the labour supply elasticity. With sticky wages labour sup-
ply is demand determined. The inverse of the labour supply elasticity signals how much
compensation the household requires for supplying an extra unit of labour. When wages
are sticky, households are induced to vary their labour supply without any such compen-
sation taking place.14 Therefore, it is clear that the inverse of the labour supply elasticity
14An indirect compensation takes place, since firms make higher profits when workers are paid a wage
that is off their labour supply schedule.

is closely related to the welfare cost of wage inflation. For instance, setting  = 1 brings
the weight on wage inflation relative to price inflation down to 3.1 for our benchmark
calibration. Other important parameters determining the weights on wage and price dis-
persion are the elasticities  and . The higher these parameter, the more substitutable are
different varieties of labour in production. Since welfare is decreasing in the dispersion
of goods or labour across varieties, a given amount of dispersion of relative prices results
in lower welfare when goods are more substitutable.
We next address whether choosing the average contract duration rather than the av-
erage age as a metric to make contracting schemes comparable influences our welfare
comparison systematically.
5.1 Average duration or average age?
Choosing the average contract duration as our metric for making different schemes com-
parable implies that the average time elapsed since last adjustment in a cross-section (the
average age) is different across schemes.15 In particular Calvo (1983) contracts have a
higher average age in a cross-section than Taylor (1980) contracts, despite the fact that
the expected duration of a contract is the same. For instance, our Calvo (1983) wage
contracts with  = 3
4
are on average 4 quarters old, whereas our 4 periods Taylor (1980)
contracts are on average 2.5 quarters old. It is therefore of interest to find out how the
welfare costs of nominal rigidities depend on the average contract age.
We show that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities under Calvo (1983) contracts are
non-monotonic in the average age of contracts. The following graph plots the welfare
costs of nominal rigidities as a function of the probability  that the random signal to
change the contract is not received. Both the average age in a cross section and the
average duration of Calvo (1983) contracts are equal to 1
1-
.
Two effects influence the welfare costs, when agents can adjust their contracts less
often. More agents keep their contract fixed and therefore do no respond optimally to
current period shocks. That effect tends to increase the welfare costs. However, those
agents that currently receive a signal to change their contract are attaching more weight
to economic conditions farther into the future as their contract is fixed for a longer period.
They therefore tend to also be less responsive to current economic conditions and that
effect works to decrease relative price dispersion. The result is a non-monotonic relation
depicted in the above figures. Apparently, the two mentioned effects interact strongly
with monetary policy as the location of the peak depends on the monetary policy rule in
place.16
The message of this simple plot is as follows. When comparing welfare costs across
different contracting scheme holding fixed the average contract duration we are in effect
comparing schemes with different average ages in a cross-section. However, on average
15For the Calvo (1983) contracts both the expected lifetime of a newly set contract and the average age
of contracts in a cross-section are equal to the inverse of the reset probability. For N period Taylor (1980)
contracts the expected lifetime is N and the average age is N+1
2
.
16If the shock has zero autocorrelation, than economic conditions in the period of the shock are most
different from those in the following periods. Therefore, the peak of the plot of the welfare costs with
respect to the average contract duration should occurs earlier than with highly correlated shocks. Numerical
results support this and therefore tend to support our line of intuitive argument.

older Calvo (1983) contracts do not necessarily imply higher welfare costs than on average
younger Calvo (1983) contracts, as the plot shows.
This hump shaped relation between contract duration and the welfare costs of nominal
rigidities is not specific to Calvo (1983) contract. Similar plots hold for Taylor (1980)
contracts, but the shape and the location of the peak differ.
5.2 Welfare costs of sticky contracting schemes
Table 3 displays the welfare cost of nominal inertia for the considered contracting schemes.
In that table, we express the welfare cost in terms of a per period compensation17 and as
a fraction of 1 per cent. We consider two comparisons. In the first one, we hold the aver-
age duration of newly set contracts constant across schemes as is typical in the literature
(see Kiley (2002)). In the second one, we modify the vector  of adjustment probabili-
ties such that the average age in a cross section is equal across schemes. The particular
average we choose is that of 2 period Taylor price contracts and 4 period Taylor wage
contracts, i.e. 1.5 and 2.5. Note that requiring equal average age as the Taylor scheme
involves shortening the average duration of the other schemes.
The first two rows of Table 3 show that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities may dif-
fer strongly across the considered contracting schemes when the average duration is held
fix. This supports the view that the exact nature of price and wage contracting schemes
can be important for the quantification of the welfare costs of nominal rigidities. In par-
ticular, under Taylor (1980) contracts the welfare costs are roughly of the same magnitude
as suggested by Lucas (2003), approximately 0.07 of one per cent of period consumption.
However, for the Calvo (1983) scheme they are roughly 3-4 times higher. The truncated
Calvo (1983) scheme and the Wolman (1999) scheme that have a 10 period support of the

age distribution of contracts deliver costs that are somewhat in between the costs implied
by the Taylor (1980) and the Calvo (1983) scheme.
However, considering rule 3 shows that the Calvo (1983) scheme need not always have
the highest welfare costs. This is in stark contrast to the unambiguous results for the case
of trend inflation in the comparison between Calvo (1983) and Taylor (1980) contracts
in the work of Kiley (2002). In his steady state analysis, the prices farther out in tail of
the age distribution of the Calvo (1983) scheme differ more and more from the aggregate
price level due to the trend in the general price level. The Taylor (1980) scheme truncates
that tail and therefore necessarily implies smaller welfare costs. The conjecture by Kiley
(2002) that this basic insight would carry over to a welfare comparison over the business
cycle18 cannot be supported by our analysis. Must a contracting scheme that features a
wider support of the age distribution necessarily imply more dispersion of relative prices
18Kiley (2002, p.291) conjectures that the gains from inflation stabilization policies in the model of Erceg,
Henderson, and Levin (2000) may be overstated due the choice of Calvo (1983) contracts.
18
or relative wages? Without trend inflation (or with full indexation to the trend inflation
rate) our results suggest the answer is no.
The intuition is as follows and similar to the one in the previous subsection. When the
age distribution has larger support, there are some agents that charge prices set farther in
the past. Their contract price tends to be more out of line with current conditions. While
that typically increases the welfare costs, those agents setting prices today will look farther
into the future and also charge a price that reflects less on current economic conditions.
Therefore widening the support of the age distribution as done in the Calvo (1983) scheme
has an ambiguous effect on relative price dispersion and therefore on welfare. Whether
contracts with a large support of the age distribution or a small support have higher welfare
costs depends on the exact model dynamics, in particular on the monetary policy rule and
on the persistence of the shocks.
Finally, we note that by requiring that all schemes have an equal average age in a
cross-section, the difference in welfare costs across schemes is somewhat smaller. In
particular, the Calvo (1983) scheme now yields the highest welfare costs throughout all 3
monetary policy rules considered.19
5.3 Welfare costs of sticky information schemes
The loss function for the sticky information model is the again of the form (42). In that
formula, one must simply substitute p
t-j
with the expectation based on the information
t - j periods ago of the optimal price and w
t-j
with the expectation based on the in-
formation t - j periods ago of the optimal wage. In the following table we display the
welfare losses associated with different monetary policy rules and different assumptions
about the arrival rates of new information. These arrival rates are the ones described in
Table 1.

Table 4 shows that the welfare costs of Mankiw and Reis (2002) price and wage setting
are typically very small. Apparently, the amount of price and wage dispersion induced by
19Extensive sensitivity analysis suggests that this is the case for a lot of parameter configurations, but
not for all. Even when requiring an equal average age, Calvo (1983) contracts may for some parameter
configuration yield higher costs than Taylor (1980) contracts.
19
the exogenous restrictions on the ability to reset contracts is much higher than the disper-
sion induced by restricting the arrival of new information. Qualitatively, this result should
not be surprising. After all sticky information agents will typically choose to post a new
price or wage even when they do not receive any new information about the state of the
world. They use optimally the information available in the period they last updated their
information set to infer about the state of the world today. Thus, the sticky information
framework typically involves less contract rigidity. The quantitative differences pointed
out here are important since more ad-hoc models of nominal rigidities are sometimes jus-
tified by arguing that agents have imperfect capacities to constantly compute and post
the optimal price. Our comparison suggests it may well make a difference for welfare
comparisons whether one explicitly models imperfect ability to process information as in
Mankiw and Reis (2002) or resorts to more ad-hoc models of price setting.
6 Robustness
So far we have assumed that capital is freely mobile across firms and can be re-allocated
as to equalize the shadow value of capital. Danthine and Donaldson (2002), Woodford
(2003, p.166) and others have pointed out that capital cannot be costlessly and instanta-
neously relocated across firms. Danthine and Donaldson (2002) view it as unreasonable
that it is too costly to post a new price tag, but that it is costless to unbolt machinery and
ship it between firms.20. Here, we check how the welfare cost of nominal rigidities across
the considered schemes depends on the mobility of capital.
For the purpose of business cycle analysis, capital might better be modeled as being
completely fixed at the firm level on a quarterly frequency. The problem of the firm is to
choose its optimal nominal price P

is average marginal cost. Since capital is fixed at the firm level, the capital-
labour ratio differs across firms and so does marginal cost. While the slope of the price
20Furthermore, Eichenbaum and Fischer (2004) show that departing from the assumption of perfect cap-
ital mobility is necessary to reconcile the Calvo (1983) model with the data. Sveen and Weinke (2004)
and Woodford (2005) further discuss the implications of modeling capital for the equilibrium dynamics in
sticky prices models
20
Phillips curve becomes much flatter, the weight on price inflation in the loss function
becomes larger. In particular, the slope of the Phillips curve decreases by a factor (1-)
(1-+ )
,
while the weight in the welfare function increases by exactly the inverse of that factor. A
given amount of inflation variability is roughly 5 times more costly than with mobile
capital for our benchmark values of  and . The same correction factors to the relation
between marginal cost and inflation and the welfare function must be applied for the more
general price setting model of Wolman (1999).
The reason why the weight in the welfare increases is as follows. Firm specific capital
implies that a given dispersion in relative quantities results in a much bigger dispersion
of labour across firms. Capital is fixed at the firm level, the firm can only adjust labour
to vary production. Since labour has decreasing marginal product in production at the
level of the individual firm, the dispersion of labour across firms is welfare reducing.21
Therefore, the weight attached to price inflation rises strongly with firm specific capital.
To understand why the the slope of the Phillips curve falls, consider the problem of a firm
that receives a signal to change its price. By setting a lower price than the fixed price firms
it can attract additional demand. But with firm specific capital marginal cost depends on
the firms' own level of production while it only depends on the aggregate production level
with a common rental market. Therefore, the firm will choose a relative price that deviates
from unity by less when marginal cost depends on own output and therefore on its relative
price. As a result the variance of price inflation is smaller with firm specific capital.22

Table 5 displays the welfare costs of nominal rigidities for the case of immobile cap-
ital. Whether we model capital as fixed at the firm level or assume a rental market does
not have a large effect on the welfare cost for the benchmark calibration of this model.
This result depends crucially on the concavity of the production function with respect to
labour, i.e. on . The welfare loss with firm specific capital increases monotonically as 
approaches unity, but remains bounded when we assume a rental market. For  close to
unity the welfare costs with firm specific capital can therefore be much larger than under
21If  = 0 production is linear in labour and capital does not enter the production function. One can
double check that our correction factor seems correct, by noting that it reduces to unity in that case as
intuition suggests it should.

Romer (1990) for the seminal paper on real rigidities.

the rental market assumption. The table shows that the loss with firm specific capital is
generally somewhat lower for the policy rules considered, but the difference is not huge.
In broad terms, the picture emerging from Table 3 is similar to that from Table 5. In par-
ticular, how we model capital does not seem to matter much for the relative welfare costs
of our 4 considered schemes.
7 Summary and conclusion
Our main findings have already been summarized in the introduction. Here, we only
briefly sketch the papers main contributions.
Overall, we find that the welfare costs of nominal rigidities depend very strongly
on the particular scheme used for introducing nominal rigidities. Contrary to the find-
ing of Kiley (2002) for the case of trend inflation we do not find that the Calvo (1983)
schemes necessarily overstates the welfare costs of nominal rigidities relative to contract-
ing schemes with a smaller support of the age distribution. In the baseline parameteriza-
tion of the model, Calvo (1983) contracts give rise to welfare costs of nominal rigidities
that are more than 3 times as high as for Taylor (1980) contracts. However, there are
monetary policy rules for which Calvo (1983) contracts may also imply similar or even
slightly smaller welfare costs over the business cycle than Taylor (1980) contracts. The
intuition for this result is as follows. When the age distribution has larger support, there
are some agents that charge prices set farther in the past. Their contract price tends to be
more out of line with current economic conditions. While that effect typically increases
the welfare costs, those agents setting prices today will look farther into the future and
also charge a price that reflects less on current economic conditions. Therefore widening
the support of the age distribution as done in the Calvo (1983) scheme has an ambiguous
impact on relative price dispersion and therefore on welfare.
We show how the welfare costs of nominal rigidities and the relative welfare costs
across modeling schemes depend surprisingly little on capital mobility. As discussed,
the reason is that immobile capital strongly increases the welfare cost of a given amount
of dispersion of relative prices but also generates less equilibrium price dispersion. We
finally analyze the welfare costs implied by the sticky information scheme of Mankiw and
Reis (2002). We apply the same restrictions on the availability of information costs as we
did in our earlier analysis on the ability to change contracts. The resulting welfare costs
of the sticky information scheme however are much smaller.
22
Appendix
In this section we document the sensitivity analysis undertaken. We present surface plots
of the welfare costs of nominal rigidities for the Calvo (1983) scheme and of the Calvo
(1983) scheme relative to the Taylor (1980) scheme when varying two parameters while
keeping the others at their benchmark value. We show that the welfare costs of nominal
rigidities are increasing in the inverse of the Frish elasticity of labour supply , the coeffi-
cient of relative risk aversion  as well as the substitutability among differentiated labour
 and among differentiated goods . The economic explanation for this has been given in
the text, it is not repeated here.
However, for any value of these key parameters governing the level of the welfare cost
and given our benchmark monetary policy rule the welfare costs implied by Calvo (1983)
contracts are always roughly 2-4 times higher than those of Taylor (1980) contracts.
