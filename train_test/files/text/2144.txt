Aging is a risk factor for impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. Of the reported 25.8 million Americans estimated to have
diabetes, 26.9% are over the age of 65. In certain ethnic groups, the proportion is even higher; almost 1 in 3 older Hispanics and
African Americans and 3 out of 4 Pima Indian elders have diabetes. As per the NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination) survey, the percentage of physician-diagnosed diabetes increased from 3.9% in middle-aged adults (40­49 years)
to 13.2% in elderly adults (75 years). The higher incidence of diabetes is especially alarming considering that diabetes in itself
increases the risk for multiple other age-related diseases such as cancer, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, and
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this review, we summarize the current evidence on how aging affects pancreatic  cell function,  cell
mass, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. We also review the effects of aging on the relationship between insulin sensitivity
and insulin secretion. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to impaired glucose homeostasis and T2D in the elderly will lead
to development of novel treatments that will prevent or delay diabetes, substantially improve quality of life and ultimately increase
overall life span.
1. Introduction
Aging is an important risk factor for metabolic disorders,
including obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2
diabetes (T2D). Diabetes and its complications remain major
causes of morbidity and mortality in the USA [1]. It has been
reported that the prevalence of T2D increases with age and
peaks at 60­74 [2­4]. Almost one third of the elderly have
diabetes and three quarters have diabetes or prediabetes
[5]. The higher incidence of diabetes is especially alarming
considering that diabetes in itself increases the risk for
multiple other age-related diseases such as cardiovascular
disease (CVD), atherosclerosis, stroke, Alzheimer disease
(AD), Parkinson's disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), and cancer [6]. The pathogenesis of T2D in aging
is characterized by two major features: peripheral insulin
resistance and impaired insulin secretion from  cells [7].
Here, we review how aging predisposes to diabetes and
impaired glucose tolerance through effects on insulin secre-
tion and insulin action.
2. Aging and Insulin Secretion
Age-related defects in insulin secretion have been demon-
strated in rodents as well as humans. Glucose and amino
acid are major stimuli for insulin release from the pancreatic
 cell. With aging, there is a decrease in insulin secretion
following stimulation with glucose as well as amino acid argi-
nine [8]. Decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
(GSIS) in vivo has been shown in rodents using the state-
of-the-art hyperglycemic clamps [9]. In humans, disorderly
insulin release, a decrease in insulin pulse amplitudes, and
decreased response to glucose oscillations as well as alter-
ations in insulin clearance have all been demonstrated [10].
When the insulin secretory defects are superimposed over an
increased need for insulin as in old age, impaired glucose
2 International Journal of Endocrinology
homeostasis, glucose intolerance, and diabetes can result.
We have demonstrated in rodent models that older rodents
are unable to increase insulin secretion in proportion to the
increased demands imposed by insulin resistance [9], thus
contributing to impaired glucose tolerance. Similarly, studies
in humans have demonstrated a secretory defect that is con-
sistently observed even after controlling for insulin action.
Many factors contribute to the decrease in insulin secretion
in aging, including the age-associated loss of Sirt1-mediated
GSIS [11], decreased -cell sensitivity to circulating incretins
[10], age-associated decrease in mitochondrial function, as
well as increased oxidative stress [12]. In this section of
the review, we will specifically address age-related decline
in various aspects of -cell function and mass that could
contribute to the observed defects in insulin secretion.
2.1. Aging and Glucose Stimulated Insulin Secretion. Insulin,
secreted from pancreatic  cells, is the major hormone in reg-
ulating glucose homeostasis. The secretion of insulin from 
cells is a complex process involving the integration of multi-
ple stimuli, such as nutrients, hormones, neurotransmitters,
and drugs, but the primary stimulus for insulin secretion
is circulating glucose. Aging is associated with a marked
decline in GSIS in both humans and rodents [13, 14] and
the impairment of GSIS is one of the hallmarks of T2D
[15]. It is widely accepted that there are five important
and "regulatable" steps involved in glucose-induced insulin
secretion (as shown in Figure 1): (1) glucose is transported
into the  cells through the translocation of the glucose
transporters (GLUTs), especially GLUT2; (2) generation of
ATP through the oxidation of glucose; (3) elevation the ratio
of ATP/ADP induces closure of cell-surface ATP-sensitive K+
(KATP) channels, leading to cell membrane depolarization;
(4) extracellular Ca2+ influx into the  cell; (5) a rise in
cytosolic Ca2+ triggering the exocytosis of insulin granules.
We will systematically address how aging affects each of these
processes.
2.1.1. Aging and Glucose Transporters in  Cells. As shown
in Figure 1, initiation of the glucose transport is the first
step that links glucose metabolism to insulin release in the
 cell. GLUT2 is the major glucose transporter expressed in
pancreatic  cells and ensures large bidirectional fluxes of
glucose and other dietary sugars, such as fructose and gal-
actose, in and out the cell due to its low affinity and high
capacity. Glucose transport is an earlier event in GSIS. Loss
of pancreatic -cell GLUT2 expression in humans is associ-
ated with hyperglycemia and impaired GSIS [16], and the
loss of GSIS directly correlates with decreased expression of
the  cell GLUT2 in several rodent T2D models [16]. Hou
et al. observed that high extracellular glucose concentrations
enhance GLUT2 endocytosis, which leads to the insulin
secretion in GLUT2 overexpressed -cell line [17]. However,
the internalized GLUT2 protein undergoes rapid degradation
induced by chronic high-glucose stimulation, which indi-
cates that hyperglycemia directly affects  cells function [17].
Moreover, mice lacking GLUT2 in pancreatic  cell display
an almost complete absence of first phase glucose stimulated
insulin secretion [16]. Taken together, these studies suggest
that GLUT2 is essential for GSIS and lack of GLUT2
causes hyperglycemia. GLUT2 expression was diminished in
very old animals compared with juvenile and adult rhesus
monkeys [18], implying the potential connection between
age and GLUT2 expression level. Age-associated decrease
in expression of GLUT2 has been demonstrated in aged
rodent models along with other  cell specific genes [19]. The
study by Ohneda et al. shows that GLUT2 is underexpressed
with increased age; however, neither the magnitude of the
underexpression of GLUT2 nor of the reduction in GLUT2
transport function in islets of Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats is
sufficient by itself to explain the profound reduction in GSIS
[20]. Compared to rodents, recent evidence demonstrates
that human  cells express three glucose transporters,
GLUT1, 2, and 3 [21]. The higher levels of GLUT1 and
GLUT3 may introduce differences in the regulation of
glucose sensing in humans versus rodent islets.
2.1.2. Effects of Age on -Cell Glucose Oxidation. After uptake
into  cells, glucose undergoes oxidation and eventually gen-
erates ATP in cytosol and mainly mitochondria via the citric
acid cycle also known as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
or the Krebs cycle (Figure 1). In the pancreatic  cells, glucose
oxidation results in the increase of ATP production which
is required for insulin secretion. Islets from T2D patients
exhibit lower ATP content and blunted GSIS, implicating the
mitochondria in the pathogenesis of  cell dysfunction [22].
The metabolism of glucose is initiated by its phosphorylation
by glucokinase (GCK), a member of a family of evolutionary
and structurally related hexokinases. The reaction catalyzed
by GCK is the first reaction in glycolysis as well as the
first rate-limiting reaction in the metabolism of glucose
[23]. GCK mRNA level is markedly decreased in diabetic
compared to the normal rats. The gene expression level of
GCK was significantly increased with age in healthy rats
[24], suggesting a potential mechanism by which  cells
attempt to overcome age-associated glucose intolerance and
insulin resistance. Interestingly, there is evidence to show that
glucose oxidation rates are lower in older animals [25]. By
using [1-14C] and [6-14C] glucose-incubated islets isolated
from pancreases of 2-month and 12-month-old rats, G. M.
Reaven and P. D. Reaven demonstrated that the amount of
glucose converted to CO2 by islets from 12-month-old rats
was only half that of 2-month-old rats [25]. In humans, there
is a lower glucose oxidation but higher lipid oxidation rates
in elderly than in the young, suggesting that an enhanced
Randle cycle may play a major role in producing a reduction
in insulin-mediated glucose oxidation [26].
MacDonald has pointed out that pancreatic islets contain
40­70 times the activity of mitochondrial glycerophosphate
dehydrogenase (GPDH) compared to other tissues [27],
implicating the potential importance of GPDH in islets.
Since GPDH plays a crucial role in transporting and reducing
equivalents from cytosol to mitochondria, a decrease in its
activity leads to an accumulation of cytosolic NADH and
consequently, an increase in the cytosolic NAD/NAD+ ratio,
a decrease in glycolysis, and a reduction in GSIS. An ap-

proximate 50% reduction in the activity of GPDH in islets
of 12-month-old compared with 2-month-old rats [28],
suggesting a role for GPDH in diminished GSIS in aging.
2.1.3. Aging and Calcium and Potassium Channels. Increased
ATP/ADP ratio from glucose oxidation reduces the whole cell
K+ permeability, leading to cell membrane depolarization
and extracellular Ca2+ influx into the  cell. These changes
are thought to be mediated through the ATP-sensitive
K+ (KATP) channels and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
(Figure 1). Elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration
provides a link with the insulin exocytotic process. Studies
from Ammon and colleagues have shown that raising the
glucose concentration from 3 to 5.6 and 16.7 mM had no
effect on K+ efflux from islets of 24-month-old male rats
whereas that from 24-month-old female rats were decreased.
Also, net uptake of Ca2+ was significantly diminished in islets
of 24-month-old compared to islets of 3-month-old rats. In
the presence of 16.7 mM of glucose, islets of 24-month-old
rats exhibited only 60­70% of the insulin release obtained
with islets from 3-month-old rats. These data suggest that
the decreased insulin secretory response to glucose during
old age is due, at least in part, to inadequate inhibition of
K+ efflux and diminished net uptake of Ca2+ [29]. However,
it is important to consider that the differences in ion fluxes
could relate to age-related deficits in the steps leading up to
ion flux such as decreased glucose transport and oxidation.
2.1.4. Effects of Age on Insulin Granule Exocytosis. The final
step of insulin secretion is the exocytosis of insulin granules
(Figure 1). Insulin is stored in large dense core vesicles
(LDCVs), also called insulin granule, and released by exo-
cytosis, a multistage process involving vesicle trafficking,
docking, and eventually fusion with the plasma membrane
[30]. Calcium constitutes the major stimulus for exocytosis.
Ca2+ regulates several steps in exocytosis, such as the size
of vesicle pools, the fusion event, and the size of the fusion
pore, and may act on distinct protein targets [31, 32]. Since
the net uptake of Ca2+ is decreased with age [29], it is
reasonable to speculate that insulin granule exocytosis is
also inhibited by age. To date, insulin secretion is known to
involve the same soluble N-ethylmaleimide, sensitive factor
attachment protein receptor (SNARE) isoforms as those
utilized in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter
release, namely, Syntaxin 1, vesicle-associated membrane
protein (VAMP) 2, and synaptosomal-associated protein of
25 kDa (SNAP-25) [33­37]. The exocytosis is induced by the
pairing of SNARE proteins on the vesicle membrane, termed
v-SNARE (such as VAMP2), with cognate proteins on the
target membrane, the t-SNAREs (syntaxin and SNAP-25). In
addition, other proteins such as munc18/sec1 and munc13
have also been reported to be involved in the regulation
of insulin granule exocytosis [38, 39]. Vanguilder and col-
leagues showed that neurotransmission-regulating proteins
such as VAMP2, Syntaxin1, and SNAP-25 decline with age in
4 International Journal of Endocrinology
hippocampal synaptosomes in rats. Altered synaptic protein
expression may decrease stimulus-induced neurotransmis-
sion and vesicle replenishment during prolonged or intense
stimulation, two processes that are necessary for learning and
the formation and perseverance of memory [40]. However, it
is still unclear whether these proteins also decline with age in
pancreatic  cells. Further studies are needed to address this
question.
2.2. Aging and -Cell Mass. The proliferation and apoptosis
of  cells and islet neogenesis are three major factors that
tightly regulate -cell mass. As shown in Figure 2, in this
section, we will review the effects of aging on these factors.
2.2.1. Apoptosis and Proliferation. Pancreatic -cell mass is
mainly controlled by the balance of cell proliferation and
apoptosis. It has been shown that age correlates with
decreased proliferative activity and enhanced sensitivity to
glucose-induced -cell apoptosis [41] (Figure 2). In cultured
islets from 2 to 3-month-old rats, increasing glucose from 5.5
to 11.1 mM decreased -cell apoptosis and increased -cell
proliferation, which was further augmented when glucose
was increased to 33.3 mM. In contrast, in islets from 7 to 8-
month-old rats, increasing glucose concentrations from 5.5
to 33.3 mM induced a linear increase in -cell death and
a decrease in proliferation. This has also been observed in
cultivated human islets where age correlated positively with
the sensitivity to glucose-induced  cell apoptosis and nega-
tively to baseline proliferation [41]. It is reported that there
is a three-to-ten-fold increase in -cell apoptosis in diabetic
patients compared to nondiabetic individuals as detected
by TUNEL staining [42]. Maedler et al. demonstrated that
high glucose induces apoptosis in human pancreatic  cells
through inducing the expression of Fas and activation of
caspase 8 and 3 [43]. Reers et al. report that relative -fcell
volume in human pancreatic islets remains constant with
aging and -cell replication decreases age dependently, while
-cell apoptosis does not change significantly [44]. However,
the most recent study performed on 4-month, 14-month
and, 24-month-old Wistar rats has shown that there is a
significant reduction in -cell proliferation and increase in
apoptosis in  cells in the islets [45]. The study also showed
that age associated decreases in activities of many antioxidant
enzymes and suggests that an increase in oxidative stress in
the  cells contributes to the increased apoptosis [45].
Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin is cosecreted
with insulin from  cells [46]. Amylin suppresses glucagon
secretion and helps to regulate glucose homeostasis. In
insulin-resistant states, hypersecretion of insulin results in
increased cosecretion of amylin. Careful analyses show that
the amylin could aggregate into amyloid plaques that in-
crease -cell apoptosis leading to reduced islet volume and -
cell mass [47], and subsequent diabetes [48]. Accumulating
evidence implicates toxic IAPP oligomers in the mediation of
 cell apoptosis in T2D. In support, freshly dissolved human
IAPP (hIAPP, but not rodent IAPP) induces apoptosis when
added to cells in culture [49]. -cell-specific transgenic
overexpression of hIAPP result in hyperglycemia in the

mice [50]. Although research has shown that with age there
is an increased deposition of amylin in the islets of diabetic
individuals but not nondiabetic individuals [2], it is still too
early to rule out the potential influence of aging on amylin
aggregation.
-cell mass normally grows well into adulthood to pro-
vide increased insulin secretion capacity to match the greater
insulin requirements of maturity [51]. -cell mass can slowly
expand in adult rodents in response to increased insulin
requirements or during pregnancy [52]. Several mechanisms
have been invoked to explain adult -cell mass expansion,
including neogenesis from pancreatic ducts or hematopoietic
tissues [53], replication of specialized -cell progenitors, and
self-renewal by  cell [54, 55]. -cell proliferation and the
capacity of  cell to regenerate declines with age in mice [56].
Basal -cell proliferation is severely decreased with advanced
age. The rate of -cell proliferation gradually declines with
aging in rats to a steady state by 7 months of age [13].
Young mice respond to high-fat diet by increasing -
cell mass and proliferation and maintaining normal blood
glucose levels. Old mice, in contrast, do not display any in-
creases in -cell mass or -cell proliferation in response to
high-fat diet and become diabetic. There is a four-fold
increase in  cell proliferation in young mice after the
administration of streptozotocin (STZ), a chemical that is
toxic to the  cells in mammals and normally is used for
inducing insulin secretion deficiency models in rodents,
whereas no changes are observed in older mice [56].
Similarly, STZ stimulated -cell replication in young mice
but had little effect in old mice [57]. Partial pancreatectomy
greatly stimulated -cell proliferation in young mice but
failed to increase -cell replication in old mice [57].
p16Ink4a is an effector of senescence [58] and a potent
inhibitor of proliferative kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 4
(Cdk4) [59], which is essential for pancreatic  cell pro-
liferation in adult mammals [60, 61]. Islets in vivo exhibit
increased p16Ink4a expression with age in rodents and hu-
mans [62]. Another cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk6, is not
expressed in mouse islets but is very effective in driving
International Journal of Endocrinology 5
 cell replication in human islets [63]. Ablation of p16 leads
to improved -cell function with age [64]. Lack of Cdk4
expression in mice leads to insulin-deficient diabetes [65].
To perform their kinase activity, Cdks bind some kinds
of regulatory proteins called cyclins. Without cyclins, Cdks
have little kinase activity. Mouse  cells express 3 D-cyclins,
termed cyclin D1, D2, and D3; D2 is the most abundant
one whereas D3 is nearly undetectable [66]. Prenatal islet
development occurred normally in cyclin D2-/- or cyclin
D1+/- D2-/- mice. However, -cell proliferation, adult mass,
and glucose tolerance were decreased in adult cyclin D2-/-
mice, causing glucose intolerance that progressed to diabetes
by 12 months of age. Although cyclin D1+/- mice never de-
veloped diabetes, life-threatening diabetes developed in 3-
month-old cyclin D1-/+ D2-/- mice as -cell mass decreased
after birth. Thus, cyclins D2 and D1 were essential for  cell
expansion in adult mice [66]. In contrast, in the human 
cell, cyclin D3 is highly expressed, whereas cyclin D1 and D2
levels are much lower. Overexpression of cyclin D3 in isolated
human islets, especially in combination with Cdk6, induced
the greatest increase in -cell proliferation when compared
with over-expression of other cyclins [63]. Although cell
cycle proteins play crucial roles in the proliferation of
pancreatic  cells, less is known about the effects of aging on
the expression or/and activity of cyclins and Cdks; therefore,
studies in this area may contribute to a better understanding
of the relationship between aging and loss of -cell mass.
2.2.2. Islet Neogenesis.  cell proliferation is self-replication
of the  cell, whereas islet neogenesis is the differentiation
of progenitor cell or transdifferentiation of pancreatic non-
cells to  cells. Neogenesis of islets occurring during normal
embryonic development and in very early postnatal life can
lead to -cell mass expansion. In addition to fetal [67] and
neonatal [68] periods,  cell neogenesis has been shown to
be important in increasing -cell mass in the adult during
periods of increased insulin demand such as obesity [42]
and pregnancy [69]. Rosenberg et al. developed a model for
islet neogenesis in adult mammalian pancreas in the 1980s,
which showed that pancreatic ductal cells can be induced
to differentiate into normal functioning adult endocrine
cells [70]. -cell neogenesis may occur through two path-
ways, stem/progenitor cell activation and transdifferentiation
of adult pancreatic cells [71]. Islet neogenesis-associated
protein (INGAP), found in pancreatic exocrine secretions,
appears to stimulate the growth and proliferation of duct
cells and their differentiation into endocrine cells [72­74].
INGAP and a bioactive 15 amino acid synthetic peptide
(INGAP peptide) are inducers of islet neogenesis in a human
islet system [73]. Other stimuli have been demonstrated to
exert neogenic effects on the endocrine pancreas. The com-
bination of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and gastrin has
been shown to stimulate islet neogenesis in both animal
and human studies [75]. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1),
an incretin from enteroendocrine L cells of the intestine,
has been shown to induce islet neogenesis in rodents [76].
Although the potential for -cell replication appears to de-
cline substantially with age as evidenced by decreased PDX
expression, the rate of islet neogenesis (expressed as percent-
age of insulin positive duct cells) is not affected by aging in
humans [44].
In summary, various aspects of -cell mass and function
decline as a feature of age, thus contributing to the age-
associated defects in insulin secretion. This defect when
superimposed for an increased need for insulin, could con-
tribute to impaired glucose homeostasis, glucose intolerance
and diabetes. In the subsequent section, we will discuss and
review literature on age-associated deterioration of insulin
action.
3. Aging and Insulin Action
Insulin action is the ability of insulin to bind to its receptors
located on tissues including muscle, liver, and adipose
tissue and initiate signaling effects. The net physiological
metabolic effects that result from insulin signaling include
(a) regulation of glucose homeostasis through a decrease in
hepatic glucose output (via decreased gluconeogenesis and
glycogenolysis) and increase in glucose uptake, primarily into
striated muscle and adipose tissue as well as (b) increase in
lipid synthesis in fat cells, and attenuation of release of free
fatty acid from triglycerides in fat. Insulin resistance results
when normal circulating concentrations of the hormone are
insufficient to regulate these processes appropriately.
3.1. Visceral Fat. It is well documented that aging is associ-
ated with a decline of insulin action [77­79]. The decline in
insulin action with age is thought to contribute to the high
prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and Type 2 diabetes
among the elderly [80, 81]. Notably, some studies support
the hypothesis that the decline in insulin action in the elderly
persons is related to increased abdominal fat rather than to
aging per se [82]. However, other studies suggested that age-
associated insulin resistance may not be explained solely by
concomitant abdominal obesity [83]. Abdominal fat (also
called visceral fat, VF), which is located in and around the
viscera, has been demonstrated to be strongly related to
many health conditions, including CVD, insulin resistance,
and T2D [84]. Several cross-sectional studies suggest that
visceral fat increases throughout the lifespan in men and
women of all ages and race, independent of increases in body
weight [85­88]. Many factors contribute to the increased
VF seen with aging such as physiologic decline in GH/IGF-
1 axis, decrease in sex steroids as well as sedentary life
style [89]. The mechanisms how VF links to the metabolic
syndrome are still not entirely clear, but it has been suggested
to involve its anatomical location, leading to a "portal"
effect of greater free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol release
[90]. Gabriely et al. showed that extraction of VF from
20-month-old Fischer 344 Brown Norway (FBN) rats was
sufficient to restore peripheral and hepatic insulin action to
the levels of young rats. Moreover, removal of VF in Zucker
Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats prevented the progressive decrease
in insulin action and delayed the onset of diabetes, but VF
extraction did not alter plasma free fatty acid levels [91].
Borst et al. reported that VF removal in Sprague Dawley
6 International Journal of Endocrinology
(SD) rats tended to improve glucose tolerance and lowered
some pro-inflammatory adipokines in serum; these animals
displayed increased insulin-stimulated glucose transport in
excised soleus and digitorum longus muscles as compared to
control group. These studies provide verification that VF is
a potent modulator of both hepatic and peripheral insulin
action [92]. Calorie restriction (CR) extends life span and
retards age-related chronic diseases in a variety of species,
including rats, mice, fish, flies, worms, and yeast [93]. Our
studies have shown that a reduction in fat mass, specifically
VF, may be one of the possible underlying mechanisms of the
antiaging effect of caloric restriction [94].
Nowadays, adipose tissue is recognized as an active
metabolic-endocrine organ, and obesity is considered as a
low-grade inflammatory condition strongly linked to adverse
metabolic outcomes. A putative key link between increasing
fat mass and obesity-related complications, including insulin
resistance, is a chronic low-grade inflammatory state within
adipose tissue, related to infiltration by macrophages [95].
We and others have shown that VF depots display a
unique profile of inflammatory mediators compared to
subcutaneous adipose tissue, including the clearly higher
expression levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor
(MIF) and chemokine receptor 2 in VF [96, 97]. Other
studies also suggested that VF is a stronger risk factor for
metabolic disorders and mortality than subcutaneous fat
[82, 98]. MIF, a proinflammatory cytokine, can activate
nuclear factor (NF)-B signaling but directly inhibits the
function of p53 [99, 100]. MIF knockout mice live longer
than the control mice [101]. The possible explanation is
aging is associated with inflammation and inflammation
could accelerate aging process, whereas lack of MIF could
downregulate NF-B, mediated inflammatory signaling,
which will subsequently mitigate the process of aging [102].
Macrophages are considered to be a significant source
for many fat-derived proinflammatory cytokines, and the
percentage of macrophages in fat has been shown to increase
in obesity [103]. Interestingly, our study suggested that the
percentage of macrophages in the stromal vascular cell
fraction from both visceral and subcutaneous fat increased
with age regardless of obesity status [104]. Taken together,
increase of VF is a hallmark of aging and a source of increased
chronic inflammation. Inflammation could accelerate the
aging process [105] and eventually lead to the metabolic
dysfunction. Breaking this vicious cycle by decreasing the VF
will be a potential therapeutic method for treating metabolic
and related diseases (Figure 3).
3.2. Lipids and Insulin Resistance. Lack of or resistance to
insulin leads to two metabolic crises: a marked increase
in the rate of lipolysis in adipose tissue and activation of
hepatic gluconeogenesis in spite of high plasma glucose
levels. The increased rate of lipolysis increases circulating
FFA levels, which, in turn, exacerbates insulin resistance in
the whole body. It has been very well documented that the
acute elevation of plasma FFA produces insulin resistance in
both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals [106­108]. It is
also shown that chronically elevated plasma FFA levels cause

insulin resistance, and lowering elevated plasma FFA levels
overnight normalizes insulin sensitivity in obese nondiabetic
subjects and significantly improves insulin sensitivity in
obese diabetic patients [109]. The mechanisms by which
elevated levels of FFA produce insulin resistance have not
been fully understood. However, studies have shown that
increasing plasma FFAs acutely decreases insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in human [110]. It is
also reported that increase of FFA level in human inhibits
PI3 kinase activity in skeletal muscle [111], suggesting the
impairment of insulin signaling by FFA. Itani et al. pointed
out that, with the infusion of FFA, increased accumulation
of diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC) activity
in muscle contribute to the impairment of insulin signaling
[112], potentially through activation of NF-B [112]. The
steatotic liver is also resistant to insulin in terms of inhibition
of hepatic glucose production and stimulation of glycogen
synthesis. The high FFA levels may be the unifying mecha-
nism that accounts for the insulin resistance in obesity, type 2
diabetes, lipodystrophy, and aging [113]. We and others have
shown that the circulating FFA levels are significant higher
in 9- to 20-month-old SD rats compared to 3-month old,
demonstrating that circulating FFA increases with age [113].
3.3. Aging and Central Insulin Resistance. Although periph-
eral insulin resistance is a hallmark of the development of
T2D, more recent evidence has shown that insulin resistance
also exists in central nervous system (CNS), and that central
insulin action plays an important role in regulating whole
body glucose metabolism. Like peripheral tissues, molecules
in insulin signaling such as insulin receptor (IR), insulin
receptor substrates (IRS), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) are universally expressed in the brain, indicating
International Journal of Endocrinology 7
a potential role of insulin signaling in the brain. Koch et
al. showed that mice lacking IR in CNS exhibit significantly
more severe impairment of peripheral glucose homeostasis
than mice lacking IR in the peripheral tissues [114]. Gelling
et al. has shown that central infusion of PI3K inhibitor
attenuated insulin-induced glucose lowering by 35%­40% in
both acute and chronic insulin treatment paradigms, while
hypothalamic overexpression of either IRS-2, a upstream
kinase of PI3K, or protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), a key down-
stream mediator of PI3K action, enhanced the glycemic
response to insulin by 2 folds in STZ-induced diabetic rats,
suggesting that hypothalamic insulin signaling is an impor-
tant determinant of the response to insulin in the man-
agement of uncontrolled diabetes [115]. Interestingly, an
increasing body of evidence shows a link between diabetes
and AD, a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common
form of dementia. It has been reported that patients with
T2D increase the prevalence of AD by two-to-three folds
[116], and insulin levels and insulin activity in the central
nervous system are reduced in AD [117]. Studies in human
subjects show that both peripheral and central administra-
tion of insulin improves memory in AD patients [118­121],
suggesting impairment of insulin signaling in the brain as a
risk factor of neurodegenerative disorders, and restoration
of insulin signaling could be a potential therapy for AD.
This brings an interesting question whether aging is also
associated with central insulin resistance. Fernandes et al.
demonstrated that the protein levels of elements in the
insulin signaling pathway such as IRs and SRC homology
adaptor protein (SHC) did not change significantly in
the forebrain cortex and cerebellum of rats aged 1 d to
60 wk. However, insulin induced tyrosine phosphorylation
of IR and SHC, and the association of SHC/growth factor
receptor binding protein-2 (GRB2) decreased significantly in
both types of tissues [122]. Other studies showed that intra-
cerebroventricular administration of insulin was more effi-
cient at reducing food intake and body weight in 3-month-
old rats than in 8- and 24-month-old rats, indicating the
development of hypothalamic insulin resistance with age in
Wistar rats. Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR
and IRS-2 and the phosphorylation of downstream target
genes such as Foxo1 and p70S6K declined, whereas serine
phosphorylation of IR and IRS-2 increased with age in rat
hypothalamus [123].
Aging-associated increase in central and peripheral
insulin resistance could contribute to both diabetes and AD.
The field of central insulin resistance and its role in the
development of neurodegenerative disorders and the control
of whole body glucose homeostasis is complicated and
further studies are needed to fully understand the underlying
mechanisms. For a detailed review of the insulin signaling
in the brain, we refer the readers to the following reviews
[9, 124­126].
4. Aging and Whole Body Glucose Homeostasis
It is clearly established that the risk for impaired glucose
tolerance and diabetes increase with age in rodents and
humans. The specific factors such as increased VF and cir-
culating FFA that contribute to impaired insulin action and
various defects in -cell mass/function have been highlighted
in the previous section. However, the integrated whole body
glucose homeostasis is complex with various age-related
parameters playing a crucial role on both aspects of glucose
homeostasis, namely, insulin action and insulin secretion.
Leptin, a hormone secreted from adipose tissue, plays a key
role in energy intake and expenditure. Deficiency of leptin
and its receptor leads to severe obesity, insulin resistance,
and diabetes in rodents and humans. Resistant to the effects
of leptin, termed leptin resistance, is seen in obesity and
aging. Leptin resistance associated with aging [127­129] and
decline in growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor
(IGF)-1 axis [89] could play a key role in the alterations of
glucose homeostasis in aging. Accumulating evidence sug-
gests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a role in
the pathogenesis of diabetes, contributing to both pancreatic
-cell function and peripheral insulin resistance [130]. It has
been reported that aging is related to increase in proapoptotic
markers with ER stress in multiple tissues, including lung,
liver, kidney, and brain [131, 132]. In the past decade, a fam-
ily of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide- (NAD-) dependent
protein deacetylases, termed sirtuins, have been shown to
contribute to longevity. Sirtuins slow aging in worms, fruit
flies, and mice [133]. Interestingly, overexpression of sirtuins
or treat with activators of sirtuins, such as resveratrol
protect against metabolic decline in aging, increases insulin
sensitivity, increases insulin secretion, improves life quality,
and extends lifespan [11, 117, 133]. In addition to the above-
mentioned variables, aging-associated sedentary life style
and diminished physical activity may be important factors
for age-related changes of glucose homeostasis. Research has
shown that healthy elderly with greater degrees of physical
fitness have better glucose tolerance and lower level of insulin
resistance than less active old people [134]. In addition,
aging is associated with defects in the balance of insulin
secretion and insulin action (demands). In the young, a
hyperbolic relationship exists between insulin secretion and
insulin sensitivity, whereby pancreatic  cell compensates
for changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity through a
proportionate increase in insulin secretion [116]. Our data
shows that compared to younger animals, when challenged
with a prolonged hyperglycemic stimuli older animals are
unable to maintain the insulin secretion proportional to the
degree of resistance [115].
Whole body glucose homeostasis is a complex balance of
glucose production and utilization by different tissues. Food
intake and hepatic glucose production are the two sources
of glucose production, while skeletal muscle contributes
to the majority of the glucose uptake and utilization.
Utilizing tracer technology, it is possible to differentiate
between the effects on glucose production (liver) and
glucose utilization (primarily the muscle). Hepatic glucose
production (HGP) plays crucial roles in glucose home-
ostasis, both in the fasting and postprandial states. In
contrast to rodents, where there is an increase in HGP in
age, there are no differences in either the basal hepatic
glucose production or the dose-response curve of its
8 International Journal of Endocrinology
suppression by insulin between young and old individu-
als [135]. The European Group for the Study of Insu-
lin Resistance reported that hepatic glucose production does
not increase with age, when adjusted for lean body mass
[136]. Furthermore, hepatic glucose output has not been
shown to be increased in elderly patients with T2D [137].
Thus, hepatic insulin resistance does not seem play a sig-
nificant role in decreased glucose tolerance of elderly people
[138].
As mentioned earlier, skeletal muscle is the major source
of glucose utilization. Glucose is transported into the cells by
glucose transporters. Through anaerobic and aerobic path-
ways, glucose is broken down to generate energy. GLUT4
is the major glucose transporter in skeletal muscle respon-
sible for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Muscle GLUT4
protein level is not altered in obesity and T2D, however, its
expression levels decline with age, and are related to insulin
sensitivity in normal controls [139]. European Group for the
Study of Insulin Resistance demonstrated that glucose uptake
is not altered as a function of aging per se but is secondary
to increased body fat accumulation [140]. Moreover, the
decrease of lean body mass [141] and contractile strength
with age are other factors that contribute to the reduction in
insulin stimulated glucose uptake. The above factors, along
with changes in body composition, accumulation of VF,
and increase in circulating FFA levels, contributes to the
decreased glucose uptake with age.
5. Conclusion and Perspective
Glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and T2D associated
with aging are leading causes of morbidity and mortality
through its multiple complications as well as increases in the
risk for multiple other age-related diseases such as cancer,
stroke, cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, and AD
[6]. Though various factors that contribute to the changes
in glucose homeostasis are relatively well characterized, there
are still areas that are not yet fully elucidated such as the
roles of aging on -cell mass and function, and the cross-
talk between central and peripheral insulin action. A com-
prehensive understanding of all the defects that impair
glucose homeostasis in the elderly will lead to development of
appropriate, novel treatments that will substantially improve
quality of life and over all life span.
