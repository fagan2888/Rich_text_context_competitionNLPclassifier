determine what is true we ought to follow what is most probable.
--Descartes, Discourse on Method
The dynamism that will inevitably mark unfolding future
events over the next decade and beyond will shape and shift
healthcare in new and unexpected ways. Nursing must be a
key player if it is to continue to evolve and develop as a pro-
fession. Nursing education, particularly at the level of under-
graduate pre-registration programs, will form a vital part in
informing the direction of the profession. Designing nursing
curricula to be proactive rather than reactive to future events
is essential in future-proofing nursing education.
Nevertheless, the process of translating a myriad of contex-
tual factors to inform future directions for nursing education
is as difficult as it is necessary. This article proposes a means
of future-proofing nursing education by incorporating cur-
rent and emerging trends relevant to the Australia context
into curriculum design.
Background
The profession of nursing is influenced by a complex myriad
of political, economic, social, technological, environmental,
and legal factors. For instance, political machinations have
heralded initiatives such as the 2010 launch of Australia's
National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (NRAS) to
improve health workforce mobility and offer a nationally
cohesive and consistent approach to the registration of health
professionals and accreditation of health curricula (NRAS,
2012). The political agenda is closely associated with eco-
nomic forces as governments struggle to ensure that health-
care expenditure is both effective and fiscally sustainable.
Beyond politics and economics, the shifts in the social
fabric of all nations are exerting influence on priorities in
global healthcare. As westernized nations become healthier
and live longer, significant challenges are expected to pres-
ent in the near future as an aging population, the demand for
health services, and the identification of major health issues
relating to chronic illness become pressing areas of need.
In the Australian scene, technology continues to play a
central role in addressing areas of need and easing some of
the challenges faced as the complexity of the healthcare envi-
ronment increases. Initiatives such as remote patient monitor-
ing and "telehealth" will become more commonplace

Abstract
The relevance of pre-registration programs of nursing education to current and emerging trends in healthcare and society
could have a significant future impact on the nursing profession. In this article, we use a PESTEL (politics, economics, society,
technology, environment, and law) framework to identify significant current and future priorities in Australian healthcare.
Following the PESTEL analysis, we conduct a review of the curriculum content of current Australian undergraduate pre-
registration nursing curricula. The data were analyzed to determine how nursing curricula were aligned with the priorities
identified in the PESTEL analysis. Findings suggest that preparation­practice gaps are evident in nursing curricula as the broad
priorities identified were poorly reflected in undergraduate pre-registration programs. The study recommended (a) the
establishment of a nationally consistent mechanism to identify current and emerging trends in healthcare and higher education,
and (b) an evidence-based framework that enhances forward planning in the design of undergraduate pre-registration nursing
curricula.

modalities of treatment in healthcare. Nevertheless, one
challenge that technology may not be able to overcome
occurs in a broader, more concerning context--climate
change. Climate change is expected to have a significant
impact on health over the coming decades with a greater
incidence of natural disasters and the endangerment of resi-
dences and food and water supplies. This global issue has
been identified as the most significant risk to health in the
21st century by the World Health Organization (WHO;
2014c, 2014d).
Ongoing changes in broad global and national contexts
raise questions about the position of nurses and nursing edu-
cation and whether the legal framework of practice in which
nurses operate should evolve with the same momentum that
marks healthcare. Health Workforce Australia (HWA) are
working toward expanding the professional roles of the cur-
rent health workforce including advancing nursing practice
through the use of nurse practitioners, promoting nurses and
midwives work to full scope of practice and the development
of that career pathways that accommodate and promote prac-
tice enhancement (Gallagher, Fry, & Duffield, 2010).
Schober and Affara (2006) assert that advancing nursing
practice is a global phenomenon. They highlighted that pro-
moting this reform agenda has required a global debate
within and external to nursing (Barton, Bevan, & Mooney,
2012; Schober & Affara, 2006), a debate that has occurred
and continues in Australia (Adrian, 2005; Nursing and
Midwifery Board of Australia, 2013).
It is in this dynamic and complex environment that nurs-
ing operates; an environment that demands professional
responsiveness to factors, seemingly distanced from the pro-
fession of nursing and nursing education. So much is clear;
nursing and nursing education faces considerable challenges
in light of the influence of political, economic, social, tech-
nological, environmental, and legal factors both now and in
coming decades. With these matters at hand, an analysis of
current and emerging factors, extrinsic and intrinsic to nurs-
ing education, was undertaken to evaluate the alignment of
undergraduate pre-registration nursing education with the
future needs of Australian healthcare.
Method
The authors employed a two-phase process to (a) identify
future directions of healthcare relevant to the nursing profes-
sion using a PESTEL (politics, economics, society, technol-
ogy, environment, and law) analysis framework to categorize
the coded data, and (b) conduct a basic online survey of each
discrete subject in every undergraduate pre-registration nurs-
ing curricula in Australia to assess the level of alignment
with the PESTEL results, nationally. Although other entry-
to-practice pathways were considered for inclusion in the
survey, the variability of entry points to graduate pre-
registration programs was considered to be a confounding
factor--particularly when pre-requisite requirements and
credits awarded for previous study are not routinely pub-
lished in curriculum documents online.
First Phase
Literature pertaining to the future directions of Australian
healthcare was retrieved such as strategic plans, future pro-
jections, white papers and annual government, and other rel-
evant organizational reports (e.g., Australian Institute of
Health and Welfare [AIHW], Australian Nursing &
Midwifery Accreditation Council [ANMAC], and HWA). A
search of peer-reviewed literature from July 2001 to July
2013 was conducted using Google Scholar, Medline,
ProQuest, and EBSCOHost. The following search terms
were entered: future health, future healthcare, future
Australia, future Australia health, future nurs*, future eco-
nomic*, future politic*, future environ*, future population*,
future, future politic*, future economic*, future soci*,
strateg* AND health AND Australia. Gray literature was also
searched with attention given to government reports and
future projections.
A PESTEL analysis framework has been utilized in
macro-environmental analyses (Gillespie, 2011) and in stra-
tegic planning for future contingencies (Walsh, 2005).
PESTEL is a mnemonic used to group factors in the macro-
environment to enable the identification of general opportu-
nities and risks that impact on future outcomes (Issa, Chang,
& Issa, 2010; Kotler & Armstrong, 2004). Analyzing macro-
environmental factors is especially valuable when used to
understand how external influences, drivers, and hurdles
impact on a particular area of focus such as nursing educa-
tion (Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, & Pyle, 2011). As such,
the PESTEL analysis framework was used to codify and cat-
egorize current and emerging trends relevant to nursing edu-
cation and the broader healthcare environment. Data were
assigned a code and categorized according to their relevance
to one or more PESTEL factors. Two authors, to ensure inter-
rater reliability, assessed relevance. Where two authors were
unable to agree on relevance, a third author was used to facil-
itate agreement. Conceptual connections were made while
analyzing the data resulting in the development of categories
within the PESTEL factors.
Second Phase
A search was conducted of the Australian Health Practitioner
Regulation Agency (AHPRA) website for Australian under-
graduate pre-registration nursing programs leading to regis-
tration (AHPRA, 2012). The following search parameters
were entered: Profession--Nurse, Division--Registered
Nurse; Qualification Type--General; Country--Australia;
Course Type--Bachelor Degree. Ninety programs of study
were revealed with double-degrees, post-graduate programs,
conversion courses were eliminated from the results. Where
an institution offered more than one variation of an award,
Ralph et al. 3
only the primary program was included. Curricula from the
34 institutions remaining were retrieved and subject titles,
subject synopses, and subject learning outcomes were
obtained and analyzed to assess their alignment with the
PESTEL analysis results from the first phase of the study.
Subjects clearly addressing categories pertaining to the
PESTEL analysis were assigned a code. Where subjects had
a non-descript title such as "Nursing 1" and a subject synop-
sis or learning outcomes were not available, the data were
coded as invalid. A code was also assigned to subjects where
investigation of title and/or content synopsis failed to clearly
identify a match with PESTEL categories (e.g., those that
provided foundational content only such as anatomy, physi-
ology, and pharmacology subjects).
Findings
Findings are presented according to the phases of the research
process.
First Phase
Clear categories were developed following coding and anal-
ysis of the data retrieved using the search terms. The data
were selectively coded for information relating to current
and emerging trends in healthcare and higher education
(Table 1).
Second Phase
Following the completion of the PESTEL coding and analy-
sis, an analysis of curricula was undertaken to align the con-
tent of nursing programs with the results of the PESTEL
analysis undertaken in the preceding phase.
The analysis was performed to ascertain nursing students'
quality of exposure to the future needs of the Australian
healthcare system. Seven hundred seventeen discrete sub-
jects were identified across all curricula sourced. Fifty-one
subjects were coded as invalid data leaving 666 discrete sub-
jects for analysis. Table 2 relates to the incidence of align-
ment between PESTEL categories and subject content.
Although the overall percentage of subjects aligned with
the PESTEL analysis is indicative of the national emphasis
on the emerging requirements for future nursing practice, an
institution-by-institution breakdown of curriculum content
was conducted to highlight the manner in which institutions
prepare nursing students for future nursing practice. As such,
PESTEL factors across institutional programs were graphed

Discussion
Politics
Although the findings have illustrated some clear challenges
relevant to the nursing profession, the political landscape in
relation to health is largely marked by reform. For instance,
the National Health Reform Agenda features principally in
the political macro-environment and offers insight into the
present path dependencies of Australian healthcare in the
future. Reform is centered on targeting priority areas such as
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) health, remote
and rural health outcomes and mental illness (AIHW, 2012).
Further attention is given to quality improvement measures
designed to enhance access, efficiency, and performance
such as improved access to dental care, public hospital
admission times, the establishment of national access targets,
and the integration of strategies to embed prevention and
early intervention (Australian Government, 2010).
Strengthened consumer engagement and voice is central to
this aspect of reform as the aim is to establish a healthcare
system that is innovative, research centered, knowledge-led,
and continuously improving (AIHW, 2012). Of note, is the
reform agenda's focus on optimizing the health system for
the future as reference given to the need to respond to emerg-
ing challenges? Specifically, these challenges are seen as
connecting and integrating health and aged care services; the
arrival of the "next generation" of Medicare (Australia's
publically funded healthcare service); creating an agile and
self-improving health system for long-term sustainability
using data, information, and communication intelligently;
improving the funding design and strategic purchasing
throughout the system: all of which will be underpinned by a
well-educated modern, learning, and supported workforce
(AIHW, 2012; ANMAC, 2012; Australian Government,
2010).
The political agenda in higher education since the Bradley
Review (Australian Government, 2008) has provided impe-
tus for structural reform, increased funding and improved
quality, equity, and access. Concurrent to reforms in the
higher education; the healthcare sector has focused on build-
ing a sustainably funded, nationally unified, and locally con-
trolled health system to achieve the goals of improving
accessibility to health services and enhancing performance,
transparency, and accountability (Australian Government,
Department of Health and Ageing, 2010). Although time has
not revealed the full effect of reform and its relationship to
nursing and nursing education, the national trajectory of
political direction is apparent. In optimizing the health sys-
tem for the future, there is an expectation that health econom-
ics, health informatics, technology, health systems, quality
improvement, performance, and care coordination will be
featured more in undergraduate nursing education (ANMAC,
2012).
Registered nurses (RNs) will also need knowledge and
experience in complex care, community, primary, and sub-
acute health contexts as well as possess expert communica-
tion, teamwork, leadership, and coordination skills
(Australian Government, 2010). Given the emerging priori-
ties in education and health, it is certain that nursing educa-
tion will need to be reviewed with renewed emphasis placed
on ensuring programs of education are inclusive of the key
priorities of reform. Already, changes are evident in pre-reg-
istration nursing education with the expectation that all cur-
ricula will include leadership and management, globalization
of healthcare, and advanced level of clinical knowledge
skills (HWA, 2012a). Embedding the political agenda as an
informant of nursing education is essential to ensuring the
congruency of direction for nursing education nationally.
Political agendas globally impact on health workforce
recruitment and retention initiatives and drive education and

training reform. The WHO, for example, responded to the
identified global shortage of health professionals by devel-
oping a framework for action titled Transformative Scale Up
of Health Professional Education (International Council of
Nursing Education Network, 2013; WHO, 2011). This initia-
tive heralded the need for changes to the education of health
professionals and argued for the alignment of curricula with
community needs, promoted the strengthening of graduates
social accountabilities, and advocated the use of enhanced
teaching technologies (WHO, 2011). The International
Council of Nurses (ICN) Nursing Education Network in
2010 reported on the global nursing and health professional
shortage highlighting the international trend for entry to
practice for RNs at the bachelor's degree level with a move
from 3- to 4-year baccalaureate degrees (International
Council of Nursing Education Network, 2013).
The implications of the political agenda for nursing edu-
cation in Australia point to a healthcare sector undergoing
significant changes, where clear service priorities are
addressed in a more efficient, streamlined, performance
driven system. The Australian Government predicts that RNs
will need to prioritize knowledge and experience in complex
care, community, primary, and sub-acute health contexts as
well as expert communication, teamwork, leadership, and
coordination skills (Australian Government, 2010). Whether
there will be a gap between the preparation of nurses and the
realities of practice in the future remains to be seen; however,
the identification of different models of nursing education by
leading bodies such as the ICN is a sign that structural
changes are at the very least, being considered. Although a
4-year degree might appear an attractive solution, a better
strategy might be to first explore what a generalist philoso-
phy of education entails. Such an option may involve more
prudent, evidence-based insertions of content into pre-
registration curricula rather than simply extending the prepa-
ration over a longer period of time.
Economics
In recent years, the economics of Australian society and
Australian healthcare have changed immensely. The global
financial crisis has offered a timely reminder that economic
forces ultimately influence the fiscal situation of any coun-
try, developed or otherwise. Healthcare is an expensive
endeavor for any government, particularly those that fund
national health schemes (Heller, Oros, & Durney-Crowley,
2014). In the coming years, the impact of economic forces
will have an evident influence on the health of Australians.
Kirigia, Nganda, Mwikisa, and Cardoso (2011) contend that
there is significant evidence indicating that economic

downturns result in reduced spending on healthcare, ulti-
mately leading to poorer health outcomes with the most vul-
nerable most at risk.
Chiefly, the rising cost of healthcare is of great concern to
the sustainability of funding the health system. Furthermore,
the health workforce is growing exponentially with a 26%
increase in size in the 5 years between 2005 and 2010
although the workforce is still experiencing shortages, par-
ticularly in nursing (AIHW, 2012; HWA, 2012b; Productivity
Commission, 2005). Also contributing to rising healthcare
expenditure are key cost drivers such as an emerging empha-
sis to educate and train even more health workers to ade-
quately staff the health workforce not to mention the costs of
concertedly addressing national health priority areas relevant
to chronic disease, injury, and mental health (AIHW, 2012).
Asustainably funded health system is top priority for all gov-
ernments and health funding has become a contentious issue
globally as well as nationally (Henry, Harmer, Piggot,
Ridout, & Smith, 2009). The reality is that health funding is
at a critical point and the Australian government continues to
hotly debate its future. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that
nurses will be central role-players in this environment as the
rollout of local activity-based funding models are introduced
across the nation (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority
[IHPA], 2011). At an educational level, ANMAC have an
expectation that nursing education will increasingly address
the cost drivers of healthcare (ANMAC, 2012). The educa-
tional imperative for nurses to develop economic literacy is
foundational to charting a course for a future in which the
value of nurses is understood. In addition, the advancing
practice agenda for nursing is a means of addressing other
health professional number deficits. As nurses represent the
largest proportion of the health workforce (HWA, 2012a)
and are a more stable workforce, investing in up-skilling the
profession is an economically savvy strategy, albeit one
which is an untested assumption.
The cost of such a sizable nursing workforce--despite its
shortages--is clearly problematic. Given that nurses are now
financially recognized as a tertiary-educated, highly special-
ized profession there is--and will increasingly be--a clear
political and economic expectation across the nation that
their role in the healthcare system is filled rather than merely
occupied. As the acuity of hospital care rises and moves
toward enhancing the delivery of early intervention strate-
gies to prevent the progression of illness via health promo-
tion and primary healthcare, the nursing profession must
become more specialized, expert, and lead increasingly com-
plex care pathways in a technologically orientated setting.
These issues raise the question of size in the nursing
workforce and whether at current levels, nurses are a sustain-
able entity. Questions should be asked about the position of
the nursing profession in the health system and whether
workforce growth has continued through a belief that the
profession can be all things to all people. Further concern is
found in the up-skilling of second- and third-level nurses to
take on traditional RN roles; a situation that represents fiscal
constraint at all costs. Although advancing the baccalaure-
ate-educated RN workforce may be a costly exercise on the
face of it, in reality, the result is a cost efficiency given the
lower mortality rates comparative to settings where patients
were cared for by non-baccalaureate educated nurses (Aiken
et al., 2014). To this end, finding a way forward is essential
for the nursing profession as it must avoid a situation that
sees a decision-by-proxy made regarding future directions of
nursing education in Australia. A recent international study
examined the impact of patient to nurse ratios and nurse
qualifications on risk adversity and patient outcomes in hos-
pital settings. The findings confirmed that an increase in
nurse workloads by one patient increased the likelihood of an
inpatient dying within 30 days of admission (Aiken et al.,
2014).
Society
In Australia, a number of social trends are emerging that
will impact on the direction of nursing education across
the nation. Primarily, the growth in Australia's population
from 22 million to 36 million by 2050 will result in a sig-
nificant increase in the demand for health services
(Australian Government, 2010). Heightened demand will
coincide with an environment where the acuity of hospital
admissions is intensifying as is the complexity of service
delivery in the aged care sector (Productivity Commission,
2008). In particular, the nursing workforce requires a dou-
bling of graduate completions to cope with expected
demand (Australian HealthWorkforceAdvisory Committee
[AHWAC], 2004). Demand for hospital bed days is pro-
jected to grow faster and be increasingly allocated to older
Australians with peak demand occurring as the baby
boomer cohort pass into old age (Schofield & Earnest,
2006).
Another emerging priority is that of Australia's aging
population with more than 23% of the nation expected to be
65 years or over in 2050, up from 14% in 2010. Aging popu-
lations are a global phenomenon (Lutz, Sanderson, &
Scherbov, 2008) forcing nations to reprioritize the focus of
health policy, expenditure, and service delivery (National
Research Council (US) Panel on a Research Agenda and
New Data for an Ageing World, 2001; WHO, 2014a, 2014b).
The AIHW contend that an aging population will require fur-
ther attention from healthcare services and extend an already
stretched aged care sector (AIHW, 2012). Practically, people
living longer will see a trend toward briefer periods of mor-
bidity prior to death meaning the onset of illness to death will
be shorter than it is a present. Some perceive this trend as
leading to an offset in health expenditure across the lifetime
(Caley & Sidhu, 2011; Coory, 2004). Irrespective of the
results, the need to urgently expand the health workforce is
apparent. In particular, enhancing the aged care workforce to
remediate the age-induced tightening of the labor market and
competition from the hospitals sector is a priority
(Productivity Commission, 2005).
Ralph et al. 7
Although the current system can be applauded, it is not
without its challenges. In some areas, significant improve-
ments have been made such as the reduction in smoking rates
while action is needed in improving the health of ATSI peo-
ple (AIHW, 2012). Of great concern are the nine National
Health Priority Areas identified, namely, arthritis and osteo-
porosis, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
injury, mental health, obesity, and dementia (Australian
Government, 2012). That arthritis, asthma, cancer, cardio-
vascular disease, dementia, diabetes, and obesity do not fea-
ture in the subject titles, subject synopses, or learning
outcomes of over half of the 34 nursing programs inAustralia
is a significant concern. That mental health features in 57
discrete courses is an oddity given the mortality and morbid-
ity more strongly associated with other national health prior-
ity areas. Historically, mental health has always attracted the
attention of a discrete subject; however, if the relics of the
past are informing our planning for the future, the founda-
tions on which nursing education is built are treacherous at
the least.
Part of the response to build a workforce for the future
will be to approach healthcare through building partnerships
with the wider community, which was championed as the
way forward by the WHO in 2011 (WHO, 2011). The need to
afford health consumers more choice and to make health
information more accessible and translatable to the wider
public is essential because demand for services is projected
to rise (Koch, Nay, Mcauliffe, & Koch, 2008). Although
some may express unease that social action smacks of social
engineering, the nurse has a responsibility to do what they
can to improve the health of society and address health
inequalities (Marmot, Allen, Bell, & Goldblatt, 2011; WHO,
2011). By functioning as natural attorneys of a nation's
health, partnerships between nurses and citizens must be
established in the continuum of decision-making processes
where the delivery of healthcare is concerned. The main-
stream healthcare system must effectively extend its acces-
sibility to those living in outer metropolitan, rural, and
remote areas and in indigenous communities (Productivity
Commission, 2005).
Despite efforts to enhance access to health services, the
means of achieving this goal are unclear as the future of the
nursing profession is marked by significant projected work-
force shortages that could impede any meaningful response.
The nursing workforce is experiencing shortages that are
projected to worsen despite significant increases in graduate
numbers and an increasing reliance on overseas-trained
health workers to overcome shortfalls (HWA, 2012a;
Productivity Commission, 2005). The shortages are even
more acute in rural and remote areas and in certain special
needs sectors (HWA, 2012a).
In this context, nursing feasibly has three options: (a) con-
tinue on its current trajectory, (b) massively increase student
intake in undergraduate pre-registration programs, or (c)
redefine the nursing role to that of a highly specialized, more
focused profession. In view of present and emerging chal-
lenges, nursing might not be able to provide expertise in as
many contexts as it presently does. These options contrast
with the position of the Council of Deans of Nursing and
Midwifery (2005) who state that the nursing shortage can
only be addressed by changes to workplace relations and
conditions. Given the lack of discussion around the future of
nursing and nursing education, any decisions may well be
colored by politically expedient quick fixes to workforce
shortages rather than a serious debate on the strengths and
limitations of the nursing workforce nationally.
Fundamentally, the Australian nursing profession must
decide whether they wish to be seen politically and profes-
sionally as a highly expert, tertiary-educated profession or
whether they wish to be seen as a political quick-fix to
national workforce shortages. Whatever the course, nursing
education will be central to shaping the future foci of the
profession and defining the extent and scope of the nursing
role in a healthcare system confronting significant emerging
and future challenges.
Technology
Central to the future directions of healthcare nationally is the
widespread acceptance that technology will play a crucial
role in the success of implementing reform and enhancing
efficiency, safety, and the continued sustainability of health-
care in Australia (Banks, 2008). Already, significant move-
ments toward the "technologification" of healthcare are
happening in response to the increasing expectations that
Australians have toward healthcare accessibility (FitzGerald
& Ashby, 2010). At a national level, geo-tagging the health
of Australians is informing the creation of an Australian
Diabetes Map, while "big data" projects such as the Western
Australian Data Linkage system are influencing the delivery
of state-based healthcare by informing approaches to
research, planning, and evaluation through the identification
of health trends within the population ("Australia's Digital
Economy: Future Directions," 2009).
The role of technology as an efficient connecting inter-
face between clinician and consumer is foundational to the
partnerships that must be built to enhance the accessibility
and effectiveness of healthcare throughout Australia. Central
to this process is the requirement for investments to be made
in developing the technological skills of the health work-
force along with the improving the quality of models of care
used in a technology centric environment (Banks, 2008) and
of renewing required infrastructure. Given the continued
reliance on manual processes and information flows in a sys-
tem that daily reports 342,000 visits to general practitioners,
742,000 medications dispensed in pharmacies, 23,000 hospi-
tal admissions, and 17,000 emergency department presenta-
tions (AIHW, 2012; National E-Health Strategy, 2008), the
opportunity to utilize technology to reduce errors and system
inefficiencies is an exciting prospect.

Clearly, technology will play a significant role in the
future delivery ofAustralian healthcare with emphasis placed
on information sharing, developing service delivery tools
and providing meaningful health information sources for cli-
nicians and consumers (National E-Health Strategy, 2008).
Technological literacy will center on ways of improving
information flows between care providers to provide a foun-
dation for enhancing care planning, coordination and deci-
sion making at the point of care. Already in the current
technological environment, healthcare practitioners are able
to send digitized medical images of patient records to where
the patient is. Such records are now stored online and net-
worked throughout the facility giving clinicians opportunity
to check and update patient information anywhere in the
facility at any time ("Australia's Digital Economy: Future
Directions," 2009). Technology literacy will be central to
enhancing clinical decision making to reduce adverse events,
or enable timely identification and monitoring of care needs
(National E-Health Strategy, 2008). At its most advanced,
this concept embraces the detection and treatment of disease
through technological advances (National E-Health Strategy,
2008), while the pragmatic side of service delivery tools
leads to the integration of evidence-informed knowledge in
the care process using technology (Pfeiffer, 2009).
Although it is an expectation that graduates are able to use
information systems, preparing nurses for the technological
contexts in which they will work does not feature in many
curricula. Axley (2008) reported that there has been a rapid
expansion of the use of technology in healthcare in the
United States and highlighted that nursing curriculum has
not kept pace with this phenomenon. She asserted that skill
levels of academic staff teaching nursing students was a bar-
rier to technology featuring in nursing curriculum (Axley,
2008). The digital age is a feature of the 21st century (Heller
et al., 2014) and mandates that educators adopt new practices
in preparing nursing students for the realities of the work-
place (Simpson, 2011). Johns Hopkins University School of
Nursing introduced electronic patient records as a feature of
their simulating learning spaces and teaching techniques fol-
lowing recognition that their program was failing to prepare
students adequately for practice as graduate nurses (Birz,
2005). Whatever the solution, answers to any lack of techno-
logical literacy in nursing will likely focus on enhancing the
abilities of students and staff in becoming more adept at
responding to increasingly technologically demanding con-
texts of care.
Environment
The broader environment in which we live has and continues
to have a profound impact on the healthcare of allAustralians.
At a global level, climate change and health is inextricably
linked as it will bring changing patterns of disease, natural
resource insecurity, extreme weather events, and population
growth and migration (Costello et al., 2009; Hughes &
McMichael, 2011). Environmental events will likely drive an
emphasis on building capacity in the nursing profession to
respond to natural disasters, vector-borne illnesses; food
shortages and occasions when infrastructure breakdowns
impact on health (Costello et al., 2009; Oven et al., 2012).
Catastrophic events will not require a team of disaster nurses
but huge numbers of the nursing workforce to provide a suf-
ficient response to the situation and maintain appropriate
levels of operation on the "home front." Already Pacific
Islanders are seeing the effects of global warming and com-
munities are preparing for eventual evacuation and conse-
quent destruction of their societies. As a leading nation in the
Pacific region,Australia will be central to the regional expec-
tations of our neighbors as the first responder in times of
crisis. As the future will be characterized by deepening
stresses between human activities and wider ecosystems
(Henry et al., 2009), some of the onus for responding to the
impacts of climate change will fall to nurses. It will therefore
be necessary for nurses to develop environmentally con-
scious curricula in view of such looming stressors in the
form of disaster nursing. Given the geographically distrib-
uted nature of the workforce--the relative number of health
professionals other than nurses diminishes as the distance
from cities increases (Productivity Commission, 2005)--it is
critical to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the
available health workforce, and to improve its distribution if
nursing is to position itself as a responsive, mobile, highly
expert profession central to the health of the nation.
Law
The presiding dominance of the medical profession over
many elements of the healthcare system and by implication,
the nursing role, needs to be strongly questioned. Although
medicine has and continues to answer vital questions with
respect to the future context of healthcare, its undue influ-
ence on nursing and nurses'scope of practice is limiting. It is
an unfortunate state of affairs when it is recognized that nurs-
ing role extension usually occurs as nursing knowledge and
roles develop. Role extension has occurred as a mechanism
for medical staff shortages in rural and remote areas; in
response to changes in models of care; and as a means of
answering unmet patient needs requiring different skills; and
in reaction to the introduction of new technology (Duffield,
Gardner, Chang, Fry, & Stasa, 2011).Any expansion in scope
of practice may present complex legal and ethical dilemmas;
however, nurses should not act as a stopgap to limitations in
the service delivery capacity of the medical profession
(Linsley, Kane, Mckinnon, Spencer, & Simpson, 2008).
Nevertheless, the versatility of the profession is such that
nurses assume the function of stopgaps with regularity. The
premise of teaching nurses their legal and ethical obligations
in the context of the health system (ANMAC, 2012) should
be expanded to include their responsibility to agitate for leg-
islative reform to legitimate the development and expansion
Ralph et al. 9
of the nursing role in Australia. At a fundamental level, the
challenges ought to be addressed with the patient as the cen-
ter of care while acknowledging the basic right of access to
healthcare for all Australians (Bennett, 2009).
Furthermore, nurses can no longer hide behind the tradi-
tional hierarchical dominance of the medical profession as
protection from civil or criminal legal action. The pursuit for
professional status has brought with it an accountability that
sees nurses liable for actions performed as part of the normal
scope of their professional role. If we are to respond to the
multiplicity of health priorities in Australia while ensuring
the integrity of our professional identity, we must start with
the basics and empower a new generation of nurses to be
legally and politically savvy. Legal impetus for the establish-
ment of a future direction for the professional position must
start at educating nurses so as to prevent the passive attitude
that has led to legal restrictions being placed on nurses'scope
of practice. We must recognize that legally, the profession
cannot optimally facilitate the transformation of healthcare
in the future while being dominated by the legal restrictive-
ness that ties the nursing role to a level subordinate of medi-
cine or any other health profession. Whether nursing
education can be tailored to form the foundations of such
legal impetus, transformative of the nursing role is unknown.
Without doubt, it must at least be attempted.
Limitations
The main limitation in this study related to the diversity of
quantity and quality of publically available information per-
taining to pre-registration nursing curricula. Differences in
the minimum information requirements of course profiles,
objectives, and synopses among higher education providers
may have limited the analysis, as it is difficult to determine
the coverage of PESTEL factors in teaching resources out-
side of formalized curriculum documents. Nevertheless,
when factors such as national health priorities are prescribed
by the national accreditation standards (ANMAC, 2012) yet
not included in available program information, it opens up
the possibility for preparation­practice gaps within under-
graduate pre-registration nursing programs.
Recommendations
Although solutions to any complex problems are often clear,
simple, and wrong, we propose a number of recommenda-
tions to address the issues raised in this article:
1. Anationally consistent approach is needed to system-
atically identifying current and emerging trends
impacting on healthcare and higher education,
including a means of interpreting their relevance to
undergraduate pre-registration nursing education
programs.
2. An evidence-based framework should be imple-
mented that can facilitate undergraduate pre-registra-
tion nursing curriculum design to future proof the
current system of nursing education. The framework
would cater to the modification of curricula only
where it is relevant to verifiable current and emerging
trends; congruent with the nursing role; in keeping
with the generalist philosophy of nursing education;
and according to the priorities of health consumers'
needs.
Conclusion
The nursing profession must--if it is to successfully transi-
tion into the 21st century--decide what nursing education
and indeed nursing, needs to be. The belief that nurses can
be all things to all people is unrealistic. The expectations of
political, economic social, technological, environmental,
and legal agendas are centered on nursing evolving into a
highly educated, expert, specialized, mobile, well-remuner-
ated nursing workforce. En masse, such an ideal is not
financially sustainable. Philosophically, a shift away from
anything else but role extension professionally, is anathema
to the core reasons for shifting nursing into the university
sphere of education. The array of confusing, paradoxical,
and inconsistent approaches to undergraduate pre-
registration nursing programs is evidence of a profession
unsure of itself and largely unaware of how to establish a
system of quality education that underpins a quality profes-
sion. In this context, the sensibility of a nationally consis-
tent approach to nursing seems apparent. As a new system
of national accreditation is ushered in, the time is right to
establish a cogent strategy founded in the national domain
that offers solutions to nursing's position in the Australian
healthcare context. As little and as much is necessary if we
are to ensure that the future-proofing of nursing education
inAustralia is a successful process. Ensuring thatAustralia's
nursing workforce is well prepared to meet the demands of
the future may mean either extending the minimum course
length or enhancing the decision making around what con-
tent should be included. Investing in post-graduate educa-
tion of nurses and development of an appropriate career
pathway will support alignment of the workforce capacity
with national need. Curriculum content must be nationally
and globally relevant to future-proof nursing education in
Australia.
