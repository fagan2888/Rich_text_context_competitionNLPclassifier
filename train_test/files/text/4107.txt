Introduction and Goal of the Study
In contemporary criminology, many scholars acknowledge
that one must always take into account the impact of ecologi-
cal settings (such as neighborhoods and schools) when
studying adolescent offending (Bernburg & Thorlindsson,
2004). Out of all ecological setting characteristics, the nega-
tive effects of neighborhood disadvantage (the concentration
of poor people in areas of residence) have been studied most
intensively (Oberwittler, Rabold, & Baier, 2013; Sampson,
2012). Very often, the "contextual effects" literature is con-
ducted from the social disorganization perspective. This per-
spective highlights the negative effects of the spatial
concentration of disadvantage, such as concentrated disad-
vantage, immigrant concentration, residential mobility, and
family disruption. In the present study, we translate key ideas
developed in the rich social disorganization tradition to the
school context. Shaw and McKay (1942) were among the
first to empirically demonstrate that neighborhood structural
characteristics were correlated with delinquency rates. It was
argued that neighborhood social disorganization weakens the
ability of local social institutions to control residents' behav-
ior and results in the breakdown of informal control in the
community. These ideas have been further developed by
Sampson and Groves (1989), Grasmick, Tittle, Bursik, and
Arneklev (1993), and Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls
(1997). Especially, collective efficacy theory spawned a rich
body of empirical research (Sampson, 2012). One of the key
local institutions that is affected by structural disadvantage is
the (elementary) school in the local community. Reiss (1995)
noted, "Schools are rarely a microcosm of the communities
in which they are located" (p. 307). Given that structural
characteristics of schools are affected by both local and
extra-local factors (such as policy decisions taken at the
regional and national level), it is reasonable to assume that
the same mechanisms that apply to neighborhoods as eco-
logical units also apply to schools as ecological units. Schools
may indeed have an impact on youth behavior that is inde-
pendent of neighborhood and family influences. From a his-
torical point of view, school contextual effects have been less
studied than neighborhood effects (Sellström & Bremberg,
2006). Arum (2000) and Kirk (2009) have stressed that
scholars often--implicitly or explicitly--neglected school
contextual effects because they sometimes assume that
schools vary predominantly as a function of the demographic
and social organizational characteristics of neighborhoods,

Schools and Child Antisocial Behavior:
In Search for Mediator Effects of School-
Level Disadvantage
Lieven J. R. Pauwels1 and Robert Svensson2
Abstract
Contextual research on delinquency is primarily based on the idea that residential areas provide a major ecological setting
that (indirectly) shapes observed differences in delinquency. Just like neighborhoods, schools differ in terms of their level
of structural characteristics such as the concentration of immigrant children and children from disrupted families. Such
characteristics may also shape delinquency. The present study aims to test the relationship between structural characteristics
of schools and child antisocial behavior, using a sample of elementary school children (N = 779, aged 10-12 years in the urban
context of Ghent, Belgium). This study found that the concentration of children from disrupted families has an independent
effect on child delinquency, independent of social bonds, moral cognitions, and moral emotions. The contextual effect is fully
mediated by exposure to peer delinquency.

or that school-level variation in antisocial behavior is incon-
sequential and insignificant. Thus, to fully comprehend the
etiology of antisocial behavior, scholars should not ignore
school contextual effects. Just like neighborhoods, schools
are an important agent of socialization, which may be of rel-
evance for the unfolding of antisocial behavior (DiPietro,
Slocum, & Esbensen, 2014; Herrenkohl, Hawkins, Chung,
Hill, & Battin-Pearson, 2000). Pupils pass substantial hours
per day in schools. Thus, the amount of time that pupils are
exposed to different features in the school setting may leave
a mark on the adolescent who takes part in a school context.
Contemporary European research on adolescent offending
suggests that unique contextual effects of school-level char-
acteristics on offending exceed neighborhood contextual
effects (Oberwittler, 2007; L. Pauwels, 2013; L. J. R.
Pauwels, Weerman, Bruinsma, & Bernasco, 2014).
Structural Determinants of School-
Level Disorganization and Delinquency
There exists an ongoing debate about the negative conse-
quences of concentrations in schools of economically disad-
vantaged adolescents together with collective and subcultural
values with regard to offending (Bernburg & Thorlindsson,
2005; Boxford, 2006; Bruinsma, 1992; Felson, Liska, South,
& Mcnulty, 1994). Building on previous work of Bradshaw,
Sawyer, and O'Brennan (2009); Sapouna (2010); and L.
Pauwels (2013), we apply social disorganization theory to
the school context and search for (a) independent contextual
effects of structural determinants of school-level social dis-
organization such as immigrant concentration and family
disruption at the school level on offending and (b) mediators
of school contextual effects such as informal controls, moral
beliefs, moral emotions, and exposure to peer delinquency.
Social disorganization theory has long been recognized as
a fruitful theoretical background to study the effects of segre-
gation in neighborhoods and schools (D. Gottfredson, 2001).
Social disorganization theory deals basically with the nega-
tive consequences of segregation and the weakening of tradi-
tional institutions of socialization (Bruinsma, Pauwels,
Weerman, & Bernasco, 2013). The theory has pointed to fam-
ily disruption as one of the major structural characteristics that
has implications for informal control (Sampson & Groves,
1989). Applying social disorganization theory to schools, we
hypothesize that structural characteristics of schools impede
the maintaining of informal controls (such as attachment and
commitment to parents and schools), which in turn may
impede the development of prosocial moral beliefs and moral
emotions, and stimulate unstructured routine activities and
exposure to peer delinquency (Laub & Sampson, 2003;
Osgood, Wilson, O'Malley, Bachman, & Johnston, 1996).
However, much of the evidence is based on samples of youths
in early- to midadolescence (Vynckier & Pauwels, 2010). It is
less common that school effects of disadvantage on antisocial
behavior are tested on samples of elementary school children.
Using hierarchical multilevel models, we evaluate the inde-
pendent effects of two key structural characteristics of
schools that originate from social disorganization theory.
The focus of this study lies on school-level family disruption
(i.e., the percentage of children from a one-parent family)
and school-level immigrant concentration (the percentage of
children who have an immigrant background).1
The contextual effects literature points to distinct individ-
ual-level mediators of the relationship between structural
characteristics of schools and delinquency: Control theorists
have stressed the importance of informal controls such as
social bonds and prosocial beliefs, while social learning the-
ories (R. Akers, 2006) and the routine activities theory of
general deviance (Osgood et al., 1996) have stressed the
importance of exposure to peer delinquency and unstruc-
tured socializing. There exists a tremendous body of evi-
dence of the inhibiting effects of pupils'attachment to school
and positive relationships with teachers on adolescent delin-
quency (Kempf, 1993; Loeber & Farrington, 1998; Lucia,
Killias, & Junger-Tas, 2012) and deviant beliefs and delin-
quency (R. Akers, 2006). The relationship between peer
delinquency, unstructured socializing, and juvenile delin-
quency has been established in numerous studies. Spending
time with peers in an unstructured setting and in the absence
of adult supervision may seduce adolescents to take opportu-
nities to break rules for symbolic rewards like status and repu-
tation (Haynie & Osgood, 2005; Osgood et al., 1996). Peers
are assumed to influence juvenile delinquency by providing
definitions and attitudes which are favorable to the violation
of laws, and by reinforcing delinquent behavior through
group processes (R. L. Akers & Jensen, 2006; Warr, 2002;
Weerman, 2004). In addition, these aforementioned charac-
teristics have been identified as mediators of school charac-
teristics in previous multilevel studies (L. Pauwels, 2013).
This means that they were able to account for school contex-
tual effects on antisocial behavior. While many studies have
established a relationship between moral beliefs (either pro-
social or antisocial moral beliefs) and antisocial behavior (for
a discussion, see Svensson, Pauwels, & Weerman, 2011),
only a few studies have focused on moral emotions such as
shame and guilt (Blackwell, 2000; Hosser, Windzio, & Grev,
2008; Nagin & Paternoster, 1993; Rebellon, Piquero, Piquero,
& Tibbetts, 2010; Svensson, Weerman, Pauwels, Bruinsma,
& Bernasco, 2013; Tibbetts, 1997; Wikström, Oberwittler,
Treiber, & Hardie, 2012).2 However, none of the above-men-
tioned studies investigated to what extent the moral emotions
of anticipated guilt and shame can account for school-level
differences in child antisocial behavior. To summarize, the
unique goal of the present study to the empirical literature is
(a) to evaluate contextual effects of school characteristics
from social disorganization theory on child antisocial behav-
ior and (b) to evaluate the unique contribution of potential
mediators from different theoretical traditions, that is, social
bonds, prosocial moral beliefs and moral emotions, and expo-
sure to peer delinquency.

Context or Composition?
The study of school contextual stems comes originally from
educational research. Much attention in educational research
has been given to understanding how internal school ties
influence school effectiveness. Theory and research in this
area are often categorized under the rubric of communal
school organization, that is, the social organization of schools
as a community with a set of traditions, values, and a shared
existence (Bryk & Driscoll, 1988; Bryk, Lee, & Holland,
1993; G. D. Gottfredson, Gottfredson, Payne, & Gottfredson,
2005; Payne, Gottfredson, & Gottfredson, 2003). Structural
and organizational characteristics of a school, as well as its
social climate, consistently correlate with unsatisfactory
exam results (Goldstein & Sammons, 1997), school failure
(Kauppinen, 2008; Van Houtte, 2004), and psychological
well-being (De Fraine, Van Landeghem, & Van Damme,
2005). Many scholars have investigated the role of the school
context in the explanation of juvenile delinquency (Demanet
& Van Houtte, 2011; Fiqueira-Mcdonough, 1986; D.
Gottfredson, 2001; Parcel, Dufur, & Zito, 2010; L. Pauwels,
2013). The literature reviews by Sellström and Bremberg
(2006) and D. Gottfredson (2001) point to the fact that the
effects of structural characteristics of schools (such as disad-
vantage) on delinquency vary between countries, from small-
sized to nonexistent. Baerveldt (1992), Bruinsma (1992), and
Ousey and Wilcox (2005) found that all of the differences
between schools are due to their differential composition.
However, some scholars have found substantial contextual
effects. Lindström (1995) found small but substantial con-
textual effects on juvenile delinquency, but only for boys.
Bernburg and Thorlindsson (2004, 2005) found contextual
effects of the school social climate (values) which were inde-
pendent of individual-level conventional beliefs of adoles-
cents. A study by Sapouna (2010) showed that school-level
collective efficacy is significantly related to school bullying.
Some Belgian studies found that school-level disadvantage
was related to violent youth group involvement (L. Pauwels,
2008) and juvenile delinquency in early adolescence (L.
Pauwels, 2013).
Many explanations have been given for the observed dif-
ferences between findings: Studies differ in terms of the
population of interest (adolescents, children), units of analy-
sis (the classroom vs. school effect), sampling design and
sampling error, the measurement of concepts, measurement
error, and model specifications. Despite the differences
between studies, it seems fair to conclude that--if school
contextual effects are found on measures of antisocial behav-
ior--they are usually small and the magnitude of the effect is
depending on the measure of offending: Intra class correla-
tions seem to be somewhat larger for serious offending ver-
sus more common offending (L. Pauwels, Hardyns, & Van
de Velde, 2010).
Social Bonds, Moral Beliefs and
Emotions, and Peer Exposure as
Mediators of School Effects
The conceptual theory-driven model outlined in Figure 1 is
based on insights from integrated theories (e.g., Laub &
Sampson, 2003; Wikström et al., 2012) and argues that con-
textual effects are rather indirect and should be mediated
through a series of individual-level mechanisms. Social
bonds, moral beliefs, and moral emotions are key mediators
that are stressed in control theories. The development of
moral beliefs and moral emotions of shame and guilt emerge
during the process of primary socialization, and the family is
essential for the development of these emotions (e.g., Abell
& Gecas, 1997; Elster, 2007). The secondary socialization
through school and the peer group may consolidate or adjust
these emotions (e.g., Elkin & Handel, 1989; Gecas, 2000). If
the socialization process is completed, norms are internal-
ized and the individual develops a moral sense of what is

right or wrong in a given context. This leads the individual to
feel ashamed in relation to significant others and experience
the painful feeling of guilt when the individual breaks a
moral rule (e.g., by committing an offense; see Svensson,
2004).
In short, in today's influential integrative theories of
offending, such as Laub and Sampson's (2003) age-graded
theory of informal control and Wikström's (2010) situational
action theory, social bonds are seen as important mechanisms
with implications for the youth's moral beliefs and emotions,
which in turn have implications for unstructured routines,
exposure to peer delinquency, and offending. In situational
action theory, moral beliefs together with moral emotions,
such as shame and guilt, are seen as a "moral filter" through
which seeing crime as an alternative is affected. In short,
situational action theory argues that juvenile delinquency is
any action that is guided by (moral) rules about what it is
right or wrong to do, or not to do, in particular circumstances.
Acts of crime are actions that breach moral rules defined in
law (Wikström, 2010). To explain acts of crime is essentially
to explain moral action. Whether crime is perceived as an
action alternative depends on the individual's perception of
what it is right and wrong to do. Moral evaluations of crimi-
nal behavior and associated emotions such as anticipated
shame and guilt are three important dimensions that make up
one's overall morality in this theoretical framework.
Although attitudes that are supportive of lawbreaking are
stable covariates of offending that mediate the relationship
between social bonds and offending (Svensson et al., 2013),
less is known empirically from criminological inquiries
about the mediating role of moral feelings.
Shame emerges when an individual commits an act that
violates internalized norms, and feels that he or she fails to
live up to the norms of the group (Elster, 1999; Svensson,
2004). The individual feels ashamed in front of other people.
It has been pointed out that "we often do everything we can
to avoid the feeling of shame . . . the anticipation of shame
acts as a powerful regulator of behaviour" (Elster, 1999,
p. 154). Guilt, on the contrary, emerges when an individual
commits a specific act that violates prevailing norms and val-
ues and then judges the violation of the norm as a morally
wrong act (Elster, 1999). Guilt is considered as less painful
than shame as the emotion of guilt is related to a specific act
while shame relates to the individual's perception of the self
through the eyes of others and of these others' disapproval
(Elster, 2007).
Finally, exposure to peer delinquency is considered as a
mediating mechanism. Exposure to peers can be interpreted
from different angles: From a social learning perspective, peers
act as role models (e.g., R. Akers, 2006; Warr, 2002; Weerman,
2011), but from a routine-activities/lifestyle perspective, crime
prone individuals selectively are drawn toward delinquent peers,
who in turn act as situational instigators. Although we acknowl-
edge the complexity of the peer delinquency and offending
relationship, we consider exposure to peer delinquency to be
both a consequence of selection effects and consider the effect
of peers on delinquency at the same time as a situational trig-
ger (see Wikström & Butterworth, 2006; Wikström et al.,
2012, for a detailed discussion).
Hypotheses
To analyze whether school-level family disruption and immi-
grant concentration are relevant factors that explain child
delinquency, a series of blockwise multilevel negative bino-
mial regression models are run. Several hypotheses are tested
as follows:
Hypothesis 1: There are substantial differences between
schools in child antisocial behavior independent of the
composition of the school.
Hypothesis 2: Family disruption and immigrant concen-
tration are positively related to child antisocial behavior
independent of the school composition.
Hypothesis 3: Informal controls are inversely related to
child antisocial behavior and partially account for school
contextual effects.
Hypothesis 4: Moral beliefs and moral emotions are
inversely related to child antisocial behavior and mediate
the effects of informal controls and school-level
variables.
Hypothesis 5: Exposure to peer delinquency is positively
related to child antisocial behavior and further mediates
the effects of school-level variables and individual-level
mechanisms.
Data
The data used in the present study come from a self-reported
delinquency study conducted in the urban context of Ghent,
Belgium. Ghent is one of the Belgian cities that has more
than 100,000 inhabitants. It is a city located in the Flemish
region of Belgium. It is the capital and largest city of the East
Flanders province. Currently, Ghent comprises of nearly
300,000 inhabitants. There is a huge disparity between Ghent
neighborhoods with regard to its crime rate.
The sample consists of elementary school children, that
is, children who are in the primary compulsory education in
the Belgian educational system. The focus is restricted to
children in the two highest grades of primary compulsory
education. These children are typically between 10 and 12
years old. The two highest grades were chosen from a devel-
opmental criminological perspective, that is, these pupils are
evolving from being children to adolescents (Eisenberg,
Damon, & Lerner, 2006). Many studies have shown that
childhood antisocial behavior predicts offending during later
stages of human development. From a methodological point
of view, selective nonresponse has been shown to be lower
Pauwels and Svensson 5
among children in primary education compared with adoles-
cents in secondary education (Rovers, 1997).
The obtained sample is a convenience sample, with a lot
of variation in school context, educational level, and ethnic
background. It was not possible to draw a random sample
representing the youth population in the area exactly. In the
beginning of 2012, a letter was written to all school princi-
pals of primary education schools located in Ghent. In this
letter, the goals of the study were explained and participation
was requested. The main reason to refuse participation was
that schools already participated in other studies and/or
received too many requests from agencies. A questionnaire
for self-administration was handed out to the schoolchildren
in separate classrooms; most of the surveys were conducted
by staff, and some questionnaires were administrated with
the help of the schools. Passive informed consent was
obtained from the parents. Schools in the inner-city districts
of Ghent (postal code area: 9000) were somewhat oversam-
pled as these schools tend to have higher concentrations of
poor children and children from ethnic minorities, but suffi-
cient schools in the surrounding districts that are administra-
tively part of Ghent were reached.
In all, 884 children turned in a questionnaire and after
careful data cleaning, data from 779 children in 18 schools
were used to test the hypotheses. Unit nonresponse is still
considered a more serious problem in self-report studies
(Kivivuori, 2011). Fifty-two percent of the net-sample are
girls. Fifteen percent of the respondents live in a single-par-
ent household. Forty-six percent of the respondents have at
least one non-Belgian parent. By that, we mean that these
households are comprised of at least one parent who is not
from Belgian descent. Forty-nine percent of the pupils were
attending a school of the Catholic network (i.e., the most
common free subsidized network in Belgium). The other
pupils were either attending community education or offi-
cially subsidized education.3
The sample of 18 schools represents 39.13% of the theo-
retical population of Ghent elementary schools at the time of
the fieldwork. It is rather difficult to address the response
level in relation to the population as many pupils who attend
schools in Ghent do not live in Ghent. Furthermore, elemen-
tary schools consist of six grades and data are not available
per grade. As the sample is a convenience sample, it cannot
be seen as a representative sample of Belgian youth, but it is
sufficiently varied in terms of immigrant background and
educational level. In random population-based surveys,
respondents with an immigrant background are sometimes
underrepresented. In our sample, children who live in one-
parent families, have an immigrant background, and live in
inner-city areas are slightly overrepresented.
In the part-taking schools, unit-nonresponse was consis-
tently below 2% per school. The consequences of unit-
nonresponse are well known: Biased results may arise from
selective unit-nonresponse, but such selection bias is much
more problematic when the aim is to extrapolate findings from
the school study outside the sample frame. The study of school
variation in child antisocial behavior may be less affected as
the goal of the study is to detect effects of school-level charac-
teristics (of the participating schools that exhibit sufficient dif-
ferences in social structure) on pupils' outcomes.
Measurement of Key Constructs
The questionnaire that was administered to adolescents in
the PADS+Panel study (Peterborough Adolescent and Young
Adult Development Study) of Wikström and colleagues
(2012) was used. This questionnaire has been tested on reli-
ability and validity several times (see Wikström &
Butterworth, 2006; Wikström et al., 2012). All scale con-
structs are summative scales of several items; most of them
can be regarded as Likert-type scales. Theoretical consider-
ations as well as factor analyses (forced one-factor solutions
in an exploratory principal-axis factoring analysis) and reli-
ability analyses were used to evaluate the reported scales.
Although the item nonresponse was extremely low per item
(<2%), imputation to assign acceptable values to missing
data (using the expectation­maximization [EM] method)
was used to minimize loss of information (L. Pauwels &
Svensson, 2008).4 First, we discuss the measures of the indi-
vidual-level variables. The correlations between the vari-
ables can be found in the appendix.
Dependent Variable
Child antisocial behavior is an overall scale of antisocial
behavior that measures a combination of serious and com-
mon forms of delinquent behavior. It is a general frequency
scale that is based on the respondents answers on 12 delin-
quency items that measure how often in the last year they
have "stayed away from school without a valid reason
(played truant)"; "sprayed graffiti on walls, doors, bus stops
or elsewhere"; "thrown in a window"; "damaged on purpose
something that does not belong to you, for example, a bicy-
cle, a bus stop, a street lantern, a traffic sign, a garbage can, .
. ."; "set fire to something on purpose (e.g., a public trash
can, a barn, litter, . . .)"; "stolen something from a shop that
is worth less than 5 euros (e.g., candy, a pen, or something
else)"; "stolen something from a shop that was worth more
than 5 euros, for example, clothes, DVDs, or something
else"; "stolen something that belonged to a classmate, a
teacher at your school"; "stolen money from your parents";
"stolen a bicycle"; "taken somebody's wallet, purse, mobile
phone, or something else"; and "used a knife or other weapon
to scare or threaten somebody." Alpha is .80. Although the
scale contains two subscales, they are analyzed as an overall
scale for several reasons: Methodologically, although both
subscales (Vandalism and Property Offenses) and violent
offending are highly correlated (r = .80, p < .001), the results
6 SAGE Open
do not differ by dimension, and from a theoretical point of
view, much evidence exists for the fact that offending among
children and young adolescents is rather versatile (McGloin,
Sullivan, Piquero, & Pratt, 2007). All items were measured
on a 6-point scale (0 = not, 1 = 1 time, 2 = 2 times, 3 = 3-5
times, 4 = 6-10 times, and 5 = more than 10 times).
Independent Variables
Parental attachment is measured by "How often do you talk
to your parents (or stepparents) about how you do in school
or get along with your friends?" (answering codes: almost
never, a few times a months, a few times a week, and almost
every day), "Do you talk to your parents if you have a prob-
lem or feel sad about something?" (no, almost never, some-
times; usually I do, yes, always), "How often do you
something nice or fun together with your parents?" (almost
never, a few times a year, once or a few times a month, once
or a few times a week), and "How often do you eat evening
meals together?" (almost never, a few times a week, several
times a week, and almost every day). Alpha is .66. The items
were measured on a 5-point scale ranging from completely
disagree to completely agree.
Parental control is a combined index of both parental
supervision and perceived parental control. Parental supervi-
sion measures the degree in which parents know the where-
abouts of the adolescents (in fact, it indicates the amount of
adolescent's disclosure to their parents). It consists of three
items asking whether the parents of the respondent "know
where he or she is when out of home," "what he is doing," and
"with which friends he or she is hanging out." Perceived
parental control indicates how likely it is that parents inter-
vene in rule-breaking behavior. The measurement consists of
four items: "If you were skipping school, would your parents
try to do something about it?" "If you had spray-painted graf-
fiti on the wall of a building, would your parents tell you off
or punish you?" "If you had been beating up or threatening
somebody at school, would your parents tell you off or punish
you?" and "If you showed any disrespect to one of your par-
ents, would he or she tell you off or punish you?" Alpha is .68
for the combined scale. The items were measured on a 5-point
scale ranging from completely disagree to completely agree.
Moral beliefs measures the adolescent's attitude toward
moral rule breaking. High scores indicate high morality. The
construct is an additive index of the respondent's evaluation
of 15 situations of potential wrongdoing. Respondents were
asked to indicate how wrong it is to "ride a bike through red
light"; "skip doing homework for school"; "skip school or
work without an excuse"; "lie, disobey, or talk back to teach-
ers"; "go skateboarding in a place where skateboarding is not
allowed"; "tease a classmate because of the way he or she
dresses"; "smoke cigarettes"; "consuming alcohol"; "hit
another young person who makes a rude comment"; "steal a
pencil from a classmate"; "paint graffiti on a house wall";
"smash a street light for fun"; "steal a CD from a shop";
"break into or try to break into a building to steal something";
and "use a weapon or force to get money or things from
another young person." Alpha is .87. The items were mea-
sured on a 4-point scale (completely disagree, disagree,
agree, and completely agree).
Anticipated shame measures the extent to which an ado-
lescent would feel ashamed toward significant others when
he or she would have been caught for committing an offense.
High scores indicate high levels of shame feelings. Four
items were used: "If you were caught shoplifting and your
best friends found out about it, would you feel ashamed?" "If
you were caught shoplifting and your parents found out
about it, would you feel ashamed?" "If you were caught
damaging a car and your best friends found out about it,
would you feel ashamed?" and "If you were caught damag-
ing a car and your parents found out about it, would you feel
ashamed?Alpha is .82. The items were measured on a 3-point
scale (1 = no, 2 = yes, and 3 = yes a lot).
Anticipated guilt measures the extent to which an adoles-
cent would feel guilty when he or she would have broken
moral rules. A high score indicates a high level of guilt. The
following six items were used: "Would you feel guilty if you
did something your parents (stepparents) have told you abso-
lutely not to do?" "Would you feel guilty if you cheated on a
test in school?" "Would you feel guilty if you teased another
pupil so he or she started to cry?" "Would you feel guilty if
you stole something in a shop?" "Would you feel guilty if
you hit another pupil who made a rude remark to you?" and
"Would you feel guilty if you damaged a car?" Alpha is .75.
The items were measured on a 3-point scale (1 = no, 2 = yes,
and 3 = yes a lot).
Exposure to peer delinquency measures the amount of
delinquent and risky behavior of the adolescent's friends. It
is measured by an index of six questions about the frequency
of breaking rules by peers: How often do your friends "skip
school without excuse," "get drunk," "use drugs," "steal
something from others or from shops," "destroy things that
do not belong to them," and "beat up or get into fights with
others?" Cronbach's alpha is .70. The items were measured
on a 4-point scale (1 = none of my friends, 2 = few of my
friends, 3 = some of my friends, and 4 = [almost] all of my
friends).
Sex is coded as 0 for males and 1 for females. Immigrant
background is coded 0 when the child is born in Belgium and
both parents are born in Belgium and 1 if at least one of the
parents were born abroad. Family structure is coded as 0 if
the respondent is living with two parents and one if the
respondent is living in a single-parent family. Background
variables are seen as the background of action, while social
mechanisms are supposed to account for eventual differ-
ences between demographical categories.
School-level family disruption is the proportion of chil-
dren who come from a one-parent family, and school-level
Pauwels and Svensson 7
immigrant concentration is the proportion of children who
come from a family with a non-Belgian background (see
Table 1).
Analysis Plan
As the respondents are grouped in 18 schools, multilevel
modeling is used (Goldstein, 1995; Snijders & Bosker,
1999). Multilevel modeling is concerned with detecting con-
textual statistical effects of higher level characteristics on
behavioral and attitudinal outcomes at lower levels, and with
discerning true contextual effects from compositional effects,
or consequences of segregation or selection. Grouping the
children per class and studying classes as Level 2 units was
not considered as the classes do not represent distinct eco-
logical settings: Classes are constantly being regrouped,
depending on the courses that are given, for example, some-
times Class A and Class B are grouped together, sometimes
Class B and Class C are grouped together. Thus, in situations
where classes do not represent distinct groups, it might be
better to use another clustering level, which can be inter-
preted straightforward. The demographic background vari-
ables at the individual level are included to control for
confounding compositional effects. In school studies, the
contextual effect represents the situation where school char-
acteristics have a direct effect and can be equated with "gen-
uine ecological effects." Children differ with regard to their
family structure and schools may differ regarding the propor-
tion of children who come from a single-parent family and
with regard to the percentage of children with an immigrant
background.
Negative binomial multilevel regression models were
used to assess the effects of the independent variables on
self-reported offending (see Table 2). Negative binomial
regression models are used to model over-dispersed count
data (Hilbe, 2011). Such a model fits the distribution of count
data such as self-reported offending better than ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression models. All beta coefficients are
unstandardized coefficients of standardized variables. The
analyses are run using Mplus 7.3.
Cross-classified multilevel analysis was not considered,
as this technique demands large neighborhood and school
cross-classifications. In the present study, the number of
schools is already rather restricted from the standpoint of
multilevel modeling and the number of neighborhoods is
considerably smaller than the number of schools. This is due
to the fact that in Ghent, schools somewhat tend to be clus-
tered in some inner-city areas. Under the condition of very
few neighborhoods and schools in cross-classified multilevel
models, it is suggested to apply Bayesian bootstrapping tech-
niques, resulting in robust standard errors (Hox, 2010).
Besides that methodological argument, it should be stressed
that multilevel studies of neighborhoods (defined as census
tracts or larger areas) have generally failed to demonstrate
contextual effects on adolescent offending (Pauwels et al.,
2010).
Findings
The empty model represents a multilevel model that only
includes the intercept. It is therefore also called an intercept-
only model (Hox, 2010). Schools significantly differ from

each other with regard to self-reported offending, in line with
previous studies. The random intercept is statistically signifi-
cant from zero. Model 1 is the statistical model where control
is held for compositional effects of gender and family struc-
ture. There is still significant variation between elementary
schools independent of the demographic makeup of the
schools. Significant effects are found for girls (B = -0.53)
and immigrant background (B = 0.28). The effects of family
structure are only marginally significant (B = 0.25, p < .10).
Model 2 is a two-level model including two school-level
variables: school-level immigrant concentration (not signifi-
cant) and family disruption (B = 0.28). The analysis suggests
that only family disruption is significantly related to child
antisocial behavior, independent of the demographic compo-
sition of the schools. Including these Level 2 variables
changes the effects of Level 1 variables: Family structure has
now lost significance, and immigrant background is only
marginally significant (p < .10). Model 3 includes the mech-
anisms of informal control (parental attachment, the school
social bond, and parental control). Parental control (B =
-0.39) and the school social bond (B = -0.40) are signifi-
cantly and inversely related to child antisocial behavior, while
parental attachment is not significantly related to self-reported
offending. The contextual effect of family disruption at the
school level (B = 0.28) remains significant and unchanged.
Therefore, we cannot say that mechanisms of informal con-
trol mediate the contextual effect of family disruption. In
Model 4, we have added moral beliefs, anticipated guilt and
anticipated shame. These dimensions of morality cannot
account for the contextual effect of family disruption. Moral
beliefs and moral emotions partially mediate the effects of
parental control and the school social bond. Moral beliefs (B
= -0.27), anticipated guilt (B = -0.18) and anticipated shame
(B = -0.11), have independent effects. The negative binomial
regression coefficient of moral beliefs is higher than the
regression coefficients of shame and guilt.
Finally, exposure to peer delinquency is entered into the
equation. The introduction of exposure to peer delinquency
can fully account for the contextual effect of family disrup-
tion at the school level. Exposure to peer delinquency (B =
0.40) also partially accounts for the effects of moral beliefs
and moral emotions.
Discussion and Conclusion
The present study assessed the relationship between specific
conditions of disadvantage at the school and individual level
and child antisocial behavior. Although self-reported delin-
quency studies usually sample youth in compulsory secondary
education, this survey sampled children in the fifth and sixth
grades of the primary compulsory education in Belgium. As
far as we know, no other Belgian self-report study of school
contextual effects has been conducted among elementary
school children. Although the sample is limited to children

attending classes in schools in the urban context of Ghent,
the sample actually reflects the diversity of pupils that can be
observed in schools in highly urbanized areas. The sample is
therefore highly appropriate to identify school contextual
effects.
Most of the variation in child antisocial behavior exists
between individuals, rather than between schools. School-
level factors explain only a small amount of the total vari-
ance in child antisocial behavior. This indicates that the
differences in child antisocial behavior are, to a much greater
extent, due to individual factors rather than the school con-
text. But, simultaneously, school-level family disruption has
a moderate direct effect on the school-level differences in
child antisocial behavior attending an elementary school in
an urban context. This effect remains significant when con-
trolling for informal controls, moral beliefs, and moral emo-
tions. The effect is fully accounted for by exposure to peer
delinquency.
Structural background characteristics measured at the
individual level are not significantly associated with chil-
dren's self-reported offending, with the exception of gender.
Males are more likely to report offending than females, inde-
pendent of their immigrant background and family structure.
Children who live in a one-parent family and in families of
immigrant background are not likely to have higher levels of
antisocial behavior than children living in traditional fami-
lies and children from a fully native family background,
when control is held for gender. Self-report studies usually
find small effects of demographic background characteristics
that refer to the family social position and structure (see
Wikström & Butterworth, 2006, for a discussion). This may
be due to the fact that family structural background charac-
teristics are mostly attributes or causes of the causes of anti-
social behavior, that is, they do not bring about action.
In general, these findings are in line with previous studies
that studied school contextual effects on youths in early ado-
lescence: Moral beliefs partially mediate the effects of infor-
mal controls (L. Pauwels, 2013). Moral beliefs and moral
emotions have direct effects on child antisocial behavior.
These results are fully in line with the findings of Svensson
et al. (2013). This study is the first Belgian study that demon-
strated the effects of moral emotions on childhood delin-
quency. Exposure to peer delinquency exhibits the strongest
direct effect on child antisocial behavior: This mechanism
alone was able to account for the school-level variation in
school-level family disruption. Exposure to peer delinquency
was also able to mediate a substantial part of the effects of
moral beliefs and moral feelings.
The present study has some important limitations that
need to be taken into account when interpreting the results.
First of all, one might wonder to what extent this study
overestimates the effects of the school context. Indeed, the
present study did not simultaneously assess neighborhood
and school effects. This may seem problematic as poor
schools may be concentrated in poor neighborhoods.
However, we do not believe that the school effect is overes-
timated in our study for a number of reasons. European
cross-classified multilevel studies that assessed contextual
effects of neighborhood characteristics (i.e., effects of the
residential area where the child lives) and school-level
characteristicsfoundthattheinversewastrue:Neighborhood
effects either disappear when simultaneously controlling
for school effects or turn out to be smaller than school-level
effects (Oberwittler, 2007). Of course, neighborhood effects
may also exist with regard to the school location area. A
cross-classified analysis (that takes into account the neigh-
borhood context that refers to the neighborhood where the
school is located) was not considered to be a viable alterna-
tive for a two-level hierarchical multilevel study, due to the
fact that a number of schools were located in the same
neighborhood. Our data did not match the criteria for a sta-
ble cross-classified analysis. However, we recognized the
viability of a potential confounding mechanism and, there-
fore, we additionally controlled for dummy variables to
capture at least a part of this problem. Controlling for cen-
sus tract characteristics did not lead to the detection of
neighborhood effects. Similarly, controlling for higher
level areas (postal code areas did not yield any effects
either) did not yield any effect.
Although we found small but substantial school-level
effects, it is important for future studies to reconceptualize
contextual effects. As recent studies have revealed, it is
important to take into account the area where one really
spends a lot of leisure time. Contextual effects are best stud-
ied by simultaneously taking into account the amount of time
one actually is exposed to the setting (Wikström et al., 2012).
Another issue is that the present study is cross-sectional
and therefore causes and effects are measured at one point in
time. Although this is still the case in the majority of studies,
we believe this is a limitation, especially with regard to the
contextual effects. From a theoretical point of view, contex-
tual effects can be divided into short-term contextual effect
and long-term developmental effects (Wikström & Sampson,
2003). The study of long-term developmental effects requires
panel studies. Unfortunately, longitudinal studies of school
contextual effects on offending are not typically found.
Longitudinal studies in educational studies have shown
much larger contextual effects than cross-sectional studies. It
may thus well be possible that our study underestimates con-
textual effects.

Notes
1. Family disadvantage, such as the percentage of children who
live in families where unemployment is high, is not measured,
as a large number of children have no idea about parent's edu-
cation and employment. Although this may be seen as a short-
coming, we know from previous studies that the school level
of correlation between indicators of disadvantage is fairly
high.
2. A plethora of moral emotions (shame, guilt, anger, frustration,
etc.) play a central role in guiding people's choice of behav-
ior, and moral emotions are closely linked to moral behaviors
(Tangney & Dening, 2002; Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek,
2007). Most empirical research comes from the field of psy-
chology or sociology. It is important that criminological enqui-
ries catch up with the study of moral emotions in relation to
antisocial behavior.
3. To be more precise, 33% of the total sample was attending a
subsidized school (i.e., a school subsidized by the municipal
and provincial authorities). Finally, 18% of the pupils were
attending a method school (by that we refer to schools based
on a particular educational method, such as Rudolf Steiner
Schools and Freinet Schools).
4. Expectation­maximization (EM) imputation was conducted to
avoid an overall loss of respondents. Earlier, L. Pauwels and
Svensson (2008) compared correlations between nonimputed
and imputed scale constructs in two different samples and
found no substantial effects of item nonresponse on correlations
between variables from theories and measures of juvenile delin-
quency. Although item nonresponse was only slightly related
to some demographic background characteristics, these back-
ground characteristics were not able to successfully predict item
nonresponse on offending items in a series of logistic regres-
sion models. Therefore, the authors carefully concluded that
item nonresponse is not the most serious problem in school
surveys of adolescents.
