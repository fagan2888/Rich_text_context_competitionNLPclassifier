Introduction
In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, smooth muscle cell
(SMC) accumulation in the intima results from cell prolif-
eration and directed migration of SMCs from the media
into the intima.1 These processes are regulated by various
cytokines and chemokines through the activation of their
receptors expressed on the cell surface of vascular SMCs.2
In particular, the discovery of the prorenin receptor (PRR)
expressed in vascular SMC has opened to a completely
new scenario on the functional role of local renin­angio-
tensin­aldosterone system (RAAS) on atherosclerosis.3,4
Pioneer studies have reported the presence of all the com-
ponents of the classical RAAS pathway in atherosclerotic
lesions, implying its potential contribution on SMC accu-
mulation in the atherosclerotic plaque.5­8
PRR can be activated by either renin or prorenin;9 how-
ever, prorenin appears to be the most relevant agonist since
its plasma concentrations are approximately tenfold higher
than those of renin and the binding affinity is threefold
higher than renin.10,11 The activation of PRR has been shown
to drive cell cycle progression, DNA synthesis, ERK1(p44)
and ERK2(p42) phosphorylation,12­14 and p38 MAP kinase/
HSP27 activation,15 all events associated with cell prolifera-
tion. Moreover, we have recently provided evidence that
prorenin, through the activation of PRR, induces SMC
migration.16 It is therefore conceivable to hypothesize that
PRR activation may promote both SMCs proliferation and
migration, pivotal features of atherogenesis.17

Abstract
Background: In the present study, we investigated the potential effect of aliskiren on smooth muscle cell (SMC)
migration in response to prorenin.
Methods: Cultured human SMCs were incubated with angiotensinogen (ANG) (1.5 × 10-7M) and increasing
concentrations of aliskiren (10-6­10-5M). After 24 h, SMC migration was assessed by Boyden's chamber chemotactic
assay using prorenin as chemotactic factor (10-8M). The effect of aliskiren on RhoA and Rac activity was also determined
by G-LISA assay and the lamellipodia formation by rhodamine­phalloidin staining. Changes in cell morphology were
recorded in real-time using the iCelligence system.
Results: Aliskiren determined, at 10-5M, a significant inhibition of SMC migration induced by prorenin (-66.4±18.1%; p <
0.05), while no significant effect was observed when PDGF-BB was utilized as chemotactic agent. Aliskiren also reduced
Rac-GTP levels in response to prorenin (-54.2±5.4%) without affecting the RhoA-GTP levels. Finally, aliskiren inhibited
both the lamellipodia formation and morphological changes induced by prorenin with no significant effect on PDGF-BB
activity.
Conclusions: Taken together, we provide the first evidence of the inhibitory action of aliskiren on SMC migration
induced by prorenin.

Aliskiren represents the first direct renin inhibitor to be
approved for clinical use in hypertension that blocks the
RAAS at its point of origin,18,19 the renin­ANG interaction,
thus preventing the conversion of angiotensinogen (ANG)
to angiotensin I and interrupting the RAAS cascade. The
renin inhibition by aliskiren determines a significant
increase of renin and prorenin plasma concentrations,20 and
thus potentially the activity of PRR in vascular SMCs.
From the crystal structure modeling and the in vitro
results conducted with cells overexpressing PRR, it was
demonstrated that aliskiren does not interfere with the
binding of renin and prorenin to the PRR.13,21 However, in
a model of hypertensive diabetic renal damage, renin inhi-
bition with aliskiren suppressed renal gene expression of
the PRR and its target genes transforming growth factor-
(TGF-) and type I collagen.22 A similar inhibitory effect
of aliskiren on PRR has been observed in human aortic
SMCs incubated with both prorenin and ANG.23 Such
effect determined a significant inhibition of the transcrip-
tion of three genes, previously shown to be regulated by
prorenin, such as TGF-, type I collagen and plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).3,24 Thus, aliskiren inhibits the
in vivo RAAS activity by binding to the active site of cir-
culating renin or the unmasked catalytic site of prorenin
bound to PRR and by reducing the PRR expression.4,22,23
Although the patho-physiological relevance of the PRR
down-regulation by aliskiren still needs to be fully eluci-
dated, results from in vivo experimental studies suggest
that, to some extent, the anti-atherosclerotic properties of
aliskiren are independent from the hypotension effect.25­28
Based on these premises, in the present study we tested the
hypothesis that aliskiren may interfere with the prorenin-
dependent chemotactic effect on human aortic SMCs.
Material and methods
Cell culture
Human aortic SMCs were purchased from PromoCell
and cultured in Smooth Muscle Cell Growth Medium 2
supplemented with 5%FCS, 0.5 ng/mL of epidermal
growth factor, 2 ng/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor,
and 5 µg/mL of insulin. SMCs were utilized between pas-
sage 5 and 9. ANG and prorenin were purchased from
Vinci-Biochem.
Experimental protocols
For the determination of cell migration, SMCs were seeded
in complete medium at the density of 2 × 105 SMCs per 35
mmpetridish.After24h,cellswereincubatedinDulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.4% FCS,
ANG (1.5 × 10-7M) and increasing concentrations of
aliskiren (10-6­10-5M). After an additional 24 h, SMCs
were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in their
conditioned media and the migration determined by
Boyden's chamber chemotactic assay with prorenin
(10-8M) or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)
(10-9M) as chemotactic agents for 6­8 h. Under the same
experimental conditions, the lamellipodia formation were
assessed by rhodamine-phalloidin staining after 1 h stimu-
lation, while for G-LISA assay cells were stimulated for 10
minutes. Finally, changes of cell morphology were moni-
tored every minute for 6 h after the addition of prorenin or
PDGF-BB by iCelligence system.
Cell migration assay
The Boyden chamber and the polycarbonate membrane were
purchased from Biomap (Agrate Brianza, Milan Italy). The
membranes were coated with a 0.1 mg/mL of type I collagen
solution (PureCol®, Nutacon BV, Leimuiden, The
Netherlands) in 0.1M acetic acid at 37°C. The lower com-
partments of the wells of a modified Boyden chamber were
filled (in triplicate) with DMEM containing 0.4% FCS in the
absence or presence of prorenin or PDGF-BB, whereas the
upper compartments were filled with SMCs suspensions
containing 106 cells/mL. The cells were resuspended with
their conditioned media containingANG and increasing con-
centrations of aliskiren. The chamber was incubated at 37°C
for 6 h.The membrane was then carefully removed.Adherent
SMCs on the top were eliminated and the membrane was
stained with the Diff-Quik staining set (Biomap, Agrate
Brianza, Milan Italy). The number of transmigrated cells was
counted in four random high-power fields (HPFs) under high
magnification (objective lens 20×).29
Cytoskeleton staining
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room tem-
perature for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100
in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, and incubated
with rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy).
Cytoskeleton staining of cells was analyzed using a fluo-
rescence microscope (Axiovert M220; Zeiss Instruments).
Real-time monitoring of cell morphology using
the iCELLigence system
The iCELLigence system (ACEA Biosciences Inc, San
Diego, CA, USA) monitors cellular events in real time by
recording the electrical impedance that is correlated with
cell number, morphology and viability in a given culture
well. For analyzing SMCs morphology, 40.000 cells/well
were plated into the E-Plate L8, and the extent of cell spread-
ing was monitored every minute for 6 h with iCELLigence.
The assay system expresses impedance in arbitrary cell
index units (Rn
- Rb
)/4.6, where Rn
is the cell­electrode
impedance of the well when it contains cells and Rb
is the
background impedance of the well with the media alone.

G-LISA assay for Rac and RhoA
The intracellular amount of Rac-GTP and RhoA-GTP
were determined by using the G-LISA assay according to
the manufacturer's instruction (Cytoskeleton Inc, Denver,
CO, USA).30
Statistical analysis
All data shown are representative of at least three replicate
experiments. Data are expressed as mean±SD. Statistical
analyses were performed using either the unpaired stu-
dent's t test or 1-way ANOVA as appropriate; p values
<0.05 were considered significant.
Results
In a first series of experiments, the effect of aliskiren on
SMC migration was determined by Boyden's chamber
chemotactic assay. As previously reported,16 prorenin
induced SMC migration (2.2±0.3 fold; p < 0.05) and the
pre-incubation with 10-5M aliskiren for 24 h determined a
significant inhibition of the chemotactic effect
(-66.4±18.1%) (Figure 1). The prorenin-mediated SMC
migration has been shown to be associated with the acti-
vation of both RhoA and Rac small GTPase proteins.16
Thus the effect of aliskiren on the intracellular levels of
Rac-GTP and RhoA-GTP was investigated by G-LISA
assay. As shown in Figure 2, prorenin increased both
RhoA-GTP and Rac-GTP levels by 39.0±1.4% and
38.0±5.0%, respectively. The pre-incubation with 10-5M
aliskiren inhibited the activation of Rac (-54.2±5.4%; p <
0.05) while no effect was observed on RhoA-GTP levels
(Figure 2).
In order to investigate whether the effect of aliskiren on
SMC migration was specific to the prorenin stimulation, a
series of Boyden's chamber chemotactic assays using
PDGF-BB as chemotactic agent was performed. SMCs
were incubated for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.4%FCS
and ANG in the presence or absence of increasing concen-
trations of aliskiren and then divided in two aliquots one
for the migration towards prorenin and one towards
PDGF-BB. Interestingly, aliskiren significantly affected
the SMC migration induced by prorenin and no effect was
observed with PDGF-BB (Figure 3). These data suggest
that aliskiren selectively interferes with the prorenin
mediated chemotactic action potentially by inhibiting Rac
activation.
The effect of aliskiren on lamellipodia formation was
examined by rhodamine-phalloidin staining of filamen-
tous actin (F-actin). After 1 h stimulation of SMCs with
prorenin or PDGF-BB, a significant redistribution of
F-actin was observed, resulting in the production of lamel-
lipodia and membrane protrusions (Figure 4). The pre-
incubation of 10-5M aliskiren prior cell stimulation,
significantly affected the lamellipodia formation in
response to prorenin while no effect was observed with
PDGF-BB (Figure 4).
In order to better define the effect of aliskiren on cell
morphology a real-time recording iCelligence system
was utilized. The major advantages of this system is that
the changes in cell morphology are monitored in real
time and reported as average of 80.000 cells. As shown in
Figure 5, prorenin induced significant changes in cell
morphology as indicated by an increased cell index dur-
ing the first 3 h of stimulation reaching a plateau that was
sustained up to 6 h. The presence of 10-5M aliskiren sig-
nificantly reduces the cell index values by approximately
40% during all the duration of the recorded time.
Differently from prorenin, PDGF-BB induced a strong
and transient increase of cell index with a peak at 1h and
the presence of aliskiren did not affect this response.
Taken together, aliskiren significantly affected the SMC

Discussion
In the present report we have provided evidence that the
direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, interferes with the SMC
migration induced by prorenin. Recently, our group has
demonstrated that PRR mediates the chemotactic effect
of prorenin on SMCs and this action is mainly mediated
by the activation of the small GTPases Rac and RhoA.16
In addition, we and others, have documented that
aliskiren reduces the PRR expression in vivo and in
vitro,22,23 which, in turn, determines an inhibitory action
on PRR activity.22,23 Indeed, the effect of aliskiren on
PRR expression levels in human SMCs was shown to be
sufficient to inhibit the transcription of at least three tar-
get genes of prorenin, such as TGF-, PAI-1, and Type I
collagen22,23 In the present report, we extend these obser-
vations, reporting the inhibitory effect of aliskiren on
Rac activation in response to prorenin and SMC migra-
tion. The effect of aliskiren on cell migration was dem-
onstrated by the Boyden's chamber chemotactic assay
and confirmed by the real-time monitoring of cell mor-
phology by iCelligence system and the analysis of lamel-
lipodia formation. All these events were shown to be
significantly inhibited by aliskiren, at the concentration
of 10-5M, and only when SMCs were stimulated with
prorenin but not in response to PDGF-BB. Thus, aliskiren
appears to have a selective action on prorenin-induced
SMC migration.

in response to PDGF-BB. The experimental conditions are
the same as in Figure 2. The Boyden's chamber chemotactic

(10-9M) as chemotactic agents. p < 0.05 prorenin and PDGF-

representative of three independent experiments.

with DMEM/0.4%FCS, ANG (1.5 × 10-7M) in the presence or absence of aliskiren (10-6M, 5 × 10-6M, and 10-5 M). After 24 h, cells
were stimulated with prorenin (10-8M) for 10 minutes and G-LISA assay for Rac-GTP (a) and RhoA-GTP (b) performed from the
total protein extracts. Basal indicates cells incubated in DMEM/0.4%FCS and ANG (1.5 × 10-7 M) and not stimulated with prorenin.

Several lines of evidence indicate that Rac plays an
important role on SMC migration, associated with the
development of atherosclerotic plaque, either by inducing
the lamellipodia formation or by generating reactive oxy-
gen species (ROS) by NADPH oxidase.31,32 Our results
suggest that the inhibitory effect of aliskiren on Rac activ-
ity may be responsible for the reduction of SMC migra-
tion mediated by prorenin. Indeed, we have previously
demonstrated that the inhibition of Rac by siRNA com-
pletely abrogated the chemotactic effect of prorenin on
SMCs.16 Nevertheless, the actual inhibitory mechanism of
action of aliskiren on Rac activity is still unknown and
further investigations are required in order to determine if
aliskiren affects the post-translational modifications of
Rac, such as geranylgeranylation, or the GDP/GTP
exchange processes. Indeed, previous studies have estab-
lished the requirement of protein geranylgeranylation of
the CAAX motif of Rac and RhoA for their interaction
with the plasma membrane and with the GDP/GTP
exchange proteins.33­36 In addition, it will be interesting to
investigate the effect of aliskiren on Rac-mediated ROS
formation and its contribution on the hypertension-
associated end-organ damage.37 On this matter it is impor-
tant to mention that, recently, aliskiren has been reported
to reduce vascular NADPH oxidase activity by 41.6% in
the aortic tissue of ApoE-deficient mice.38 This evidence
further supports a potential inhibitory effect of aliskiren
on Rac.
Interestingly, aliskiren does not reduce the intracellular
levels of RhoA-GTP in SMC stimulated with prorenin.
The differential action of aliskiren on Rac and RhoA
could be related to the effect of angiotensin I receptor
(AT1R) and PRR on the two small GTPases. Indeed,
while the PRR-mediated activation of both small GTPases
has only been recently observed by our group,16 the role
of the AT1 receptor and angiotensin II in vascular SMCs
is well established.31,39,40 Under our experimental condi-
tions, the addition of prorenin, in the presence of ANG,
determines a significant increase of angiotensin II forma-
tion,23 and thus the stimulation of both receptors, PRR and
AT1R. Since aliskiren was shown to fully inhibit the con-
version of ANG to angiotensin I, and only partially

reducing PRR expression,23 the differential effect on the
two pathways may account for the selective action on
Rac.
Our finding on the effect of aliskiren on cell migration,
although obtained in an in vitro cultured system, may con-
tribute to better understand the pharmacological properties
of aliskiren. The demonstration that aliskiren can accumu-
late in the arterial wall of the small cortical vessels in the
kidney,22 suggests a possible inhibition of RAAS in the vas-
culature and PRR expression in vascular SMCs. The rele-
vance of our data are therefore reinforced by these
observations suggesting a possible in vivo pharmacological
action of aliskiren on prorenin-mediated SMC migration.
Conclusions
Taken together, in the present study, we have shown that
aliskiren inhibits prorenin-mediated SMC migration.
Additional studies are needed to determine the in vivo con-
tribution of this pharmacological action in experimental
models of cardiovascular diseases.31
