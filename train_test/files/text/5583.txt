Introduction
The potential to have somatic intersex variations exists
(however, briefly) in all humans'prenatal development in the
first few weeks--for a portion of humans, a level of ambigu-
ity in their sex traits continues on after this point (Ainsworth,
2015). Intersex variations are atypical sex characteristics
(Organisation Intersex International [OII] Australia, 2012b);
these sex characteristics potentially include our chromo-
somes, genes, external genitalia, internal reproductive
organs, hormones, or secondary characteristics (like body
hair). In the last decade, people with intersex variations have
been increasingly studied or referred to as part of an umbrella
group, rather than seen only as those with a specific variation
such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) or androgen
insensitivity syndromes (AIS). This group has been termed
(however, incorrectly or inappropriately) hermaphroditic,
intersex, as having disorders or differentiation of sex devel-
opment, or otherwise.
Problems in research beyond variable terminology include
variable population estimates. Research has generally esti-
mated that 1.7% to 4% of people go on to actually have intersex
variations (Carroll, 2005; Fausto-Sterling, 1993; OII Australia,
2012b). Given that many elements of sex (chromosomes,
genes, hormones) are not apparent without testing, current esti-
mates of the incidence and types of intersex variations seen in
humans may be conservative. Some common intersex varia-
tions are diagnosed prenatally, some at birth; others may only
become apparent at puberty, when trying to conceive, or
through random chance; and it is important to emphasize that
many people will never know they have intersex variations.
Many individuals with intersex variations have two or more
variations (Jones et al., 2016). Numbers can also be impacted
by the inclusion of congenital variations stemming from hor-
mone-related conditions; some researchers have included
extreme polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)­related hyperan-
drogenism within the umbrella of intersex variations (Huang,
Brennan, & Azziz, 2010; Jones et al., 2016). Furthermore,
researchers may intentionally or unintentionally include indi-
viduals who identify as intersex as a gender or political identity

Intersex Studies: A Systematic
Review of International Health Literature
Tiffany Jones1
Abstract
There is a need to better understand contemporary issues of nomenclature and group construction around people with
intersex variations shaping health research and practices--including their framing within concepts like disorders of sex
development (DSD), intersex, or the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) umbrella. This article reviews
health literature in the broad field of Intersex Studies since 2015. It outlines the contexts, theoretical lenses, methods and
participant numbers, framing of participants, and health findings around interventions evident in 61 sources. Sources came
from the African region, American Canadian region, Asia-Pacific region, European region, and the Middle East. While health-
related work was largely found in medical journals, it was also located in publications focused on a range of other fields
including, for example, bioethics, education, and legal studies. The piece discusses the tensions between institutional expert-
centered work with a traditional clinical/medical lens and the arguments found in a range of other patient-centered, community
group­centered, and theory-centered sources applying innovative perspectives onto key issues. Liberal Constructivist,
Bioethical Narrative Inquiry, Critical Intersex Studies, and Critical LGBTI Liberationist lenses have introduced a range of
methods (from autobiographical analyses through to large-scale online surveys) to questions of the need for and processes
of certain health care interventions and norms in the treatment of patients with intersex variations. Problematic practices
in clinical health care and research are identified and discussed: particularly the lack of adequate information dissemination
and consent-gleaning in areas ranging from anatomical photography through to application of "corrective" genital surgeries.

choice--without having somatic intersex variations. There is,
however, a need in health research to limit the group to only
those with somatic intersex variations (regardless of gender/
political identity), due to their distinct medical experiences
(Jones et al., 2016).
Another complicating issue is that the health of people
with intersex variations is sometimes studied in relation to
their sex traits, disabilities, rights, or a range of issues that
seem to lend themselves to divergent theoretical lenses
understanding this group and their needs in very different
ways. There is a need to understand how issues of group con-
struction and nomenclature shape health research around
people with intersex variations. This article reviews the
range of ways in which the health and well-being of people
with somatic intersex variations have been recently studied
in international research literature. It uses a critical sociology
of health frame, responding to and foregrounding recent
intersex activist movements casting intersex variations as a
biological variation rather than a medical pathology (Holmes,
2009; OII Australia, 2012b; Pagonis, 2016), and accepting
intersex individuals' own research on their own health and
well-being experience as part of the key literature to be
explored (rather than limiting the parameters of health litera-
ture purely to that produced by traditionally conceived medi-
cal experts).The method for the review is explained, followed
by key trends in the literature sources--their contexts, theo-
retical lenses, methods and participant numbers, and framing
of participants and interventions. This article then discusses
issues that arise from these trends and draws conclusions on
key tensions in the field.
Method
The review aimed to explore how people with somatic inter-
sex variations have been studied "as a holistic group" to bet-
ter understand how the health of "the group as a whole" has
been constructed in recent research. A formal systematic
review was completed through the ProQuest Central data-
base (selected for its broad coverage of health-related litera-
ture from a multi-disciplinary range of approaches and
lenses). An Advanced Search was completed for the key
terms "intersex" or "disorder of sex development (DSD)."
This was applied across the Source Type categories
"Scholarly Journals." The search was initially limited to
peer-reviewed full text pieces published from 2006 to 2016,
in English for (the researcher's) ease of review. As a search
from the last decade yielded 2,101 results, only the texts
from 2015-2016 were selected to provide a more recent focal
point and ensure the review was contained. Each title and
abstract were read to ensure relevance, and then the full arti-
cle was read for further clarity. Only 61 of these texts were
deemed relevant, based on their focus on humans with
somatic intersex variations/disorders of sex development/
differences in sex development (DSDs) and health care (in
its broadest sense ranging from clinical conceptualizations to
holistic well-being). Those focused on intersex expression in
animals, human sex development more broadly without any
consideration of variations, unrelated disorders or themes
(such as works solely on autism), or nonhealth related topics
were manually eliminated from the search results.
The texts were then read again in full and analyzed with
reference to a previous discourse analysis of key theoretical
indicators in the field (detailed in Jones et al., 2016). Specific
information was gleaned on their context from the publica-
tion and author location information recorded in the database
and on the documents themselves. The sources' theoretical
lenses were deduced from a combination of both their stated
theory applications (if available) and/or other indicators
including language and concept usage, data type, and meth-
odological and analytical stances (whether positivist, con-
structivist, relativist, deconstructive, subversive, or
otherwise, for example) in relation to their data collected.
The sources were allocated a roman numeral for ease of ref-
erence. The sources' specific methods, participant numbers,
and ages were directly gleaned from the sources' own
descriptive text in the abstract and the full text source, or
noted as absent. The sources' construction of people with
intersex variations (including nomenclature and variations
recognized) were directly gleaned from the sources' abstract
and full text. Finally, the health-related findings were gleaned
from direct statements (or their absence) on health-related
issues (especially interventions, including diagnosis, analy-
sis, treatment, and evaluation of any kind) experienced by
any people with intersex variations featured in the sources
(variably including the authors themselves, study partici-
pants of any kind, or any generally conceptualized version of
the group as constructed in a given source). These data were
systematically tabulated and are reported in this article in a
combination of qualitative and quantitative summaries, with
some basic figures to enhance accessibility.

(Achermann et al., 2015; Bonanni et al., 2015; Kim et al.,
2015; Lalor, 2015; Lucas-Herald et al., 2015; Mannaerts

2016; Ekenze et al., 2015; Latrech et al., 2015), and two from
the Middle East (Gül et al., 2015; Mutlu et al., 2015)--see
Figure 1. The sources specifically featured studies from a
total of 21 countries. Over half (31) of the studies were based
in the United States (Amanda, 2015; Amarillo et al., 2016;
Anderson, 2015; Baratz & Karkazis, 2015; Cynthia, 2015;

Klan, 2015; Wall, 2015; Walsh, 2015; Zieselman, 2015).
Four studies were based in India (Kalra et al., 2016; Khadilkar
et al., 2015; Palanisamy et al., 2015; Vasundhera et al., 2016),
three in Australia (Dwyer et al., 2015; Jones, 2016; Tinney
et al., 2015), and three in Brazil (Brasileiro et al., 2016;
Oliveira et al., 2015; Paula et al., 2015). Two studies were
based in China (Dong et al., 2016; Wang & Tian, 2015),
Turkey (Gül et al., 2015; Mutlu et al., 2015), and the United
Kingdom (Achermann et al., 2015; Lalor, 2015). Individual
studies were based in Belgium (Mannaerts et al., 2015),
Canada (Grimbly et al., 2016), Indonesia (Ediati et al., 2015),
Italy (Bonanni et al., 2015), Malaysia (Mohamed & Noor,
2015), Malta (Ceci et al., 2015), Mexico (Rios et al., 2015),
Morocco (Latrech et al., 2015), New Zealand (Anonymous,
2016), Nigeria (Ekenze et al., 2015), Scotland (Lucas-Herald
et al., 2015), Spain (Camats et al., 2015), and Sudan (Ahmed
& Fadl-Elmula, 2016). One study largely based in Germany
included collaborative multi-national input (Kim et al.,
2015).1
The overwhelming majority of the sources came from
peer-reviewed journals (Achermann et al., 2015; Ahmed &
Fadl-Elmula, 2016; Amanda, 2015; Amarillo et al., 2016;

One was from a peer-reviewed book series (Dreger, 2015).
Most of the journals represented were either medical journals
or at least broadly covering a thematic remit inclusive of
medical science issues. The largest number of articles (18)
from a repeatedly represented journal came from Narrative
Inquiry in Bioethics due to its release of a special issue
(Volume 5, Issue 2) focused solely on intersex themes not
otherwise typical for that journal (Amanda, 2015; Baratz &

Zieselman, 2015). Multiple articles also came from Journal
of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism (Brasileiro
et al., 2016; Grover et al., 2015; Mutlu et al., 2015; Oliveira
et al., 2015; Paula et al., 2015; Topcu et al., 2015), and three
articles from International Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology
(Grimbly et al., 2016; Lin-Su et al., 2015; Lucas-Herald
et al., 2015). Two articles came from Archives of Sexual
Behavior (Ediati et al., 2015; Kraus, 2015), BMJ Case
Reports (Bonanni et al., 2015; Mannaerts et al., 2015),
Endocrine Practice (Khadilkar et al., 2015; Saraswat et al.,
2015), Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism
(Kalra et al., 2016; Vasundhera et al., 2016) and PLoS ONE
(Camats et al., 2015; Kelsey et al., 2016). These journals his-
torically appeared to have evidenced regular past attention to
intersex themes over time outside of the pieces represented
in this literature review. Of the remaining sources, most (15)
came from individual journals/publishing series in areas of
the medical or broader health sciences that have had some
association with intersex themes in the past--in genetics
(Amarillo et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015),
endocrinology (Achermann et al., 2015; Khadilkar et al.,
2015; Latrech et al., 2015), biology (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula,
2016; Rios et al., 2015), nursing (Anderson, 2016;
Anonymous, 2016), pediatric or other surgery (Ekenze et al.,
2015; Palanisamy et al., 2015), psychogeriatrics (Tinney
et al., 2015), neuropsychiatry (Gül et al., 2015), and urology
(Ceci et al., 2015). Only nine sources came from nonmedical
journals--in education (Jones, 2016; Miller, 2015), science
ethics (Dreger, 2015; Mohamed & Noor, 2015), religion
(Grimes, 2016), rural society (Dwyer et al., 2015; Howard,
2015), and feminist legal studies (Lalor, 2015; Rubin, 2015).
These latter journals did not otherwise evidence regular past
coverage of intersex themes.
Theoretical Lenses
Direct explanations of the theoretical lenses applied in the
studies behind the sources were rare. However, the concep-
tual framings used in the studies were nevertheless apparent
in the way the sources framed people with intersex variations
(whether in pathologizing through to deconstructive views),
positioned the researcher (whether as the subject, object, or
context of inquiry) reported on data (whether using positivist
through to poststructuralist approaches), and so on. The theo-
retical lenses applied in the studies were alternately expert-
centered,patient-centered,group-centered,ortheory-centered
(see Table 1).
Institutional expert-centered. Over a third (23) of the sources
featured studies with a Traditional Clinical/Medical lens or
conceptual framing (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016; Amarillo
et al., 2016; Bonanni et al., 2015; Brasileiro et al., 2016;
Camats et al., 2015; Ceci et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; Edi-
ati et al., 2015; Ekenze et al., 2015; Grimbly et al., 2016;
Grover et al., 2015; Kelsey et al., 2016; Khadilkar et al.,
2015; Kim et al., 2015; Latrech et al., 2015; Lucas-Herald
et al., 2015; Mannaerts et al., 2015; Mutlu et al., 2015;
Palanisamy et al., 2015; Paula et al., 2015; Rios et al., 2015;
Topcu et al., 2015; Vasundhera et al., 2016). This lens privi-
leged a view of people with intersex variations as patients
with DSD and consideration of pathology in (usually some
combination of any of) their anatomy (Dong et al., 2016),
biology (Rios et al., 2015), endocrinology (Mutlu et al.,
2015), genealogy (Kim et al., 2015), and/or urology (Ceci
et al., 2015). The group was thus cast in these sources as in
need of expert-centered clinically/institutionally based anal-
ysis, diagnosis, and often corrective treatment, for example,
hormone therapy (Grover et al., 2015) or genital surgeries
(Brasileiro et al., 2016). The researchers creating the sources
were generally medical doctors, surgeons, or scientists, and
applied their interrogative work to their patients or the
patients' perceived disorders (rather than to their own medi-
cal practices, biases, or philosophies, for example). Their
reports were pitched at, for example, improving DSD diag-
nosis methods (Grimbly et al., 2016), refining analysis tech-
niques and/or intervention techniques or practices (Khadilkar
et al., 2015), and/or drawing attention to rare cases
(Palanisamy et al., 2015). Data and standards for data were
treated in a positivist manner (as being self-evident and not

conceptually in dispute). A more unique theoretical lens
which otherwise supported traditional views of patients as
having DSDs in a largely pathologizing manner and which
relied on expert-centered (religious and clinical) analysis
was seen in one additional source which used a Maqasid al-
Shari'ah lens: requiring the mechanistic interpretation of
Qur'an and Hadith toward Islamic views on health care for
patients with DSD (Mohamed & Noor, 2015).
Patient-centered. A small portion of the sources (five sources)
featured Liberal Constructivist views on clinical practice
privileging patient-centered care and some element of patient
choice (Achermann et al., 2015; Kalra et al., 2016; Lin-Su
et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2015; Saraswat et al., 2015; Wang
& Tian, 2015). The researchers creating the sources were a
combination of people with medical and other academic
backgrounds, who applied their interrogative work to
patients' or represented parties' perceptions of their own
needs, experiences, and identities, sometimes including in
literature (Kalra et al., 2016) or diagnostic manuals. Their
reports were pitched at improving patient quality of life and
holistic experience (Lin-Su et al., 2015), and/or some ele-
ments of clinical practices to enable a greater range of options
to patients (Achermann et al., 2015). Data and standards for
data were treated in a progressive manner (as being subjec-
tive and individually specific). More unique theoretical
lenses which otherwise supported liberal views on patients
as having DSDs (sometimes called "differences" in sex
development in a destigmatizing manner) were seen in two
additional sources (Gül et al., 2015; Kalra et al., 2016). One
used a Phenomenology lens: requiring the interpretation of
an individual patient's experiences--in this case, of gen-
dered psychotic delusions in relation to their social experi-
ence of intersex diagnosis (Gül et al., 2015). Another used a
Liberal Literary Forensic Analysis lens: requiring consider-
ation of ancient textual characters' reported experiences as
potentially aligned with modern experiences of DSDs (Kalra
et al., 2016).
Community group-centered.There was strong representation
(in 18 sources) of the Bioethical Narrative Inquiry lens spe-
cifically from Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics Volume 5, Issue
2 (Amanda, 2015; Baratz & Karkazis, 2015; Cynthia, 2015;

2015; Pagonis, 2015; Petersen, 2015; Quinn, 2015; Simon,
2015; Truffer, 2015; Viloria, 2015; von Klan, 2015; Wall,
2015; Walsh, 2015; Zieselman, 2015). The introducing edi-
tor Georgiann Davis had actively described the issue as
intentionally pitched at disrupting the dominance of Medi-
cal/Clinical lenses for work on people with intersex varia-
tions (Davis, 2015b). The lens privileged a critical view of
people with intersex variations as members of a marginalized
community group overall who had collectively been at risk
of poor access to medical information about their conditions
or structures privileging bodily autonomy in medical set-
tings. The use in this frame of autobiography or personal
recall of conversations with individuals from the group also
cast intersex people as individuals with underrepresented
experiences of specific variations, stories, personalities,
desires, and health care phenomena (such as interactions and
dynamics with family members and medical staff) impacting
their different health care needs. Standards for data were de-
institutionalized; the sources valued visibility or other rights-
based goals for the collective social group rather than
traditional notions of rigor or precision. Other group-cen-
tered lenses represented included Critical Intersex Studies
lenses (in three sources) focused on human rights and bodily
autonomy for intersex people as a specific group, via philo-
sophical or textual analysis (Anderson, 2015; Anonymous,
2016; Kraus, 2015). Also, Critical LGBTI Liberationism (in
three sources) focused on nondiscrimination rights for
LGBTI people more broadly (Dwyer et al., 2015; Howard,
2015; Tinney et al., 2015). The latter lens did not include a
clear conceptualization of intersex people as separate from
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, and
therefore examples did not feature clear active intersex
participation.
Theory-centered.The remaining sources (six sources) fea-
tured variously conceived deconstructive lenses which gen-
erally required conceptual critique of other theoretical
approaches to people with intersex variations seen in health-
related research, polity, or literature (Dreger, 2015; Grimes,
2016; Jones, 2016; Lalor, 2015; Miller, 2015; Rubin, 2015).
These lenses included application of Queer historiography of
health science (Dreger, 2015): a Critical-Queer feminist the-
ology (Grimes, 2016), a Transnational feminist frame (Rubin,
2015), a Postmodern and critical sociology of health (Jones,
2016), Poststructural feminist legal studies (Lalor, 2015),
and Queer theory (Miller, 2015). In these lenses, theory or
philosophy itself (including nomenclature and theoretical
constructions of people with intersex variations and their
health care needs) are interrogated whether in law or polity
(Lalor, 2015), in literature or theological texts, and/or in
fields of language and conceptualization impacting health
care (Grimes, 2016; Miller, 2015). Research itself, and
researchers, came into question (Dreger, 2015; Rubin, 2015)
and were cast as limited by their sociohistoric and location-
based contexts, field-based biases and constraints, and expo-
sures to diverse visions of health care (Dreger, 2015; Rubin,
2015).
Methods and Participant Numbers
Overall, the sources represented studies using a range of
methods, including clinical, textual, and socially oriented
approaches. The sources included a broad array of partici-
pant numbers, ranging from sources with unclear numbers of

people with intersex variations (Dwyer et al., 2015; Howard,
2015; Kim et al., 2015; Rios et al., 2015) through to a source
with 272 participants specifically from the group (Jones,
2016). Higher numbers were rare, however, as over a third of
the sources focused on only one participant (Amanda, 2015;
Bonanni et al., 2015; Brasileiro et al., 2016; Ceci et al., 2015;
Cynthia, 2015; Davis, 2015b; Garcia, 2015; Grimbly et al.,
2016; Grover et al., 2015; Gül et al., 2015; Inter, 2015; Kalra
et al., 2016; Long, 2015; Mannaerts et al., 2015; Mutlu et al.,
2015; Pagonis, 2015; Palanisamy et al., 2015; Paula et al.,
2015; Petersen, 2015; Quinn, 2015; Simon, 2015; Truffer,
2015;Viloria, 2015; von Klan, 2015;Walsh, 2015; Zieselman,
2015). Almost as many had no direct participants with inter-
sex variations and, instead, used the general existence of the
group, other participants, or secondary sources to make key
arguments about intersex variations (Achermann et al., 2015;
Anderson, 2015; Anonymous, 2016; Baratz & Karkazis,
2015; Dreger, 2015; Frader, 2015; Grimes, 2016; Kelsey
et al., 2016; Kraus, 2015; Lalor, 2015; Miller, 2015;
Mohamed & Noor, 2015; Oliveira et al., 2015; Rubin, 2015;
Saraswat et al., 2015; Tinney et al., 2015). The sources also
included a wide span of ages ranging from 1 day (Lucas-
Herald et al., 2015) to 87 years of age (Jones, 2016). Over a
third of the sources did not specify the precise ages of partici-
pants or the group being referred to (Achermann et al., 2015;
Amarillo et al., 2016; Anderson, 2015; Baratz & Karkazis,
2015; Camats et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; Dreger, 2015;
Dwyer et al., 2015; Ediati et al., 2015; Frader, 2015; Grimes,
2016; Howard, 2015; Kalra et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015;
Kraus, 2015; Lalor, 2015; Lin-Su et al., 2015; Miller, 2015;
Mohamed & Noor, 2015; Rios et al., 2015; Saraswat et al.,
2015). Around a third focused on (or could be assumed to
have focused on, given the span of time covered in the piece)
adults 18 years and above (Amanda, 2015; Anonymous,
2016; Ceci et al., 2015; Cynthia, 2015; Davis, 2015b; Garcia,
2015; Gül et al., 2015; Inter, 2015; Jones, 2016; Long, 2015;
Mannaerts et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2015; Pagonis, 2015;
Palanisamy et al., 2015; Petersen, 2015; Quinn, 2015; Rubin,
2015; Simon, 2015; Tinney et al., 2015; Truffer, 2015;
Viloria, 2015; von Klan, 2015; Wall, 2015; Walsh, 2015;
Zieselman, 2015). Ten sources focused purely on infants
and/or young people below 18 years (Bonanni et al., 2015;
Brasileiro et al., 2016; Ekenze et al., 2015; Grimbly et al.,
2016; Grover et al., 2015; Latrech et al., 2015; Lucas-Herald
et al., 2015; Mutlu et al., 2015; Paula et al., 2015; Topcu
et al., 2015). Five explicitly focused on a precise participant
group, age-range crossing over younger and adult age groups
(Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016; Kelsey et al., 2016; Khadilkar
et al., 2015; Vasundhera et al., 2016; Wang & Tian, 2015).
Figure 2 shows the seven types of methods described in
the sources. The most common methods in 18 sources consti-
tuted autobiographical critical analyses/narratives of author's
intervention impacts, observations, and/or views (Amanda,
2015; Baratz & Karkazis, 2015; Cynthia, 2015; Davis,
2015b; Frader, 2015; Garcia, 2015; Inter, 2015; Long, 2015;
Pagonis, 2015; Petersen, 2015; Quinn, 2015; Simon, 2015;
Truffer, 2015; Viloria, 2015; von Klan, 2015; Wall, 2015;
Walsh, 2015; Zieselman, 2015). These studies were mainly
on one adult individual (usually a community member rather
than an MD or academic) considering his or her own experi-
ences across his or her lifetime, especially the negative well-
being impacts of receiving a lack of information and/or
negative well-being and health impacts of early intervention
without express consent (including feelings of disconnection
from health care processes, trauma and depression, infertil-
ity, decreased sexual function/pleasure, undesired sex-based
Jones 7
presentations, and/or surgical complications). Two of these
pieces focused on secondary data (observations) about the
lack of dissemination of information or consultation with
people with intersex variations about their health needs and
experiences, seen as an abuse of the group leading to
unwanted outcomes (Baratz & Karkazis, 2015; Frader,
2015). In one example, a pediatrician expressed concern
about his and others' own endorsements of past gonad
removals (e.g., removing testes from females) on the basis of
potentially imagined cancer and "corrective" clinical con-
cerns, given retained gonads can provide patients with a
"natural" form of hormone production (Frader, 2015).
The second most common methods were random case
reports (15 sources) on analyses of patients toward diagnosis
and/or interventions (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016; Bonanni
et al., 2015; Brasileiro et al., 2016; Ceci et al., 2015; Ekenze
et al., 2015; Grimbly et al., 2016; Grover et al., 2015; Gül
et al., 2015; Khadilkar et al., 2015; Latrech et al., 2015;
Mannaerts et al., 2015; Mutlu et al., 2015; Palanisamy et al.,
2015; Paula et al., 2015; Vasundhera et al., 2016). These
were pieces written by MDs/academics on variably one to
108 participants with intersex variations whom they had ana-
lyzed and treated clinically--mainly just one infant or young
person who had been subjected to tests (anatomical, cytoge-
netic, hormonal, and/or radiological evaluations) and often
hormonal and/or surgical interventions (e.g., genital surger-
ies such as gonad removals or cosmetic constructive work,
for example, or mastectomies and so on). Evaluations of the
cases strongly privileged the MDs/academics assessment of
analytical or intervention "success," and the pieces gave a
strong overall message that in the authors' own views, the
interventions they had applied were successful overall. In
fairness, the purpose of such papers is usually to present a
novel approach to medical management, and as such would
be expected to treat the "case" as a medical condition need-
ing treatment. However, this meant the sources largely did
not report on the participants'own assessment of the need for
or success of the treatments, which could be relevant mea-
sures. Several contained direct photographs of patients'
internal and external genitalia (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016;
Brasileiro et al., 2016; Ekenze et al., 2015; Palanisamy et al.,
2015); in some of the photos, children's external genitalia
were arranged for display by another party's bare (not
gloved) hands (Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016; Brasileiro
et al., 2016; Ekenze et al., 2015). Those sources offered no
clarity about what permissions were obtained or what ethical
consideration was given to the photography process or the
individual's international online exposure, constructing the
bodies of this group as quite freely intimately accessible
without obvious ethical or hygiene considerations to medical
experts, and to any interested viewers globally.
The third most common methods were largely text-based
analyses (13 sources) including literature reviews and socio-
historical analyses of secondary records of people with
intersex variations/diagnoses/intersex groups/relevant events
(Achermann et al., 2015; Anderson, 2015; Dreger, 2015;
Dwyer et al., 2015; Grimes, 2016; Kalra et al., 2016; Kraus,
2015; Lalor, 2015; Miller, 2015; Mohamed & Noor, 2015;
Rubin, 2015; Saraswat et al., 2015; Tinney et al., 2015).
These analyses were conducted mainly by academics with a
range of training (health sciences, law, sociology, education,
etc.) on no (Grimes, 2016), through to unclear (Dwyer et al.,
2015), numbers of participants with intersex variations. The
studies mainly used the general existence of, or cited textual
or historical incidences of, people with intersex variations--
or else their fictional existence or classification/construction
(Kalra et al., 2016; Mohamed & Noor, 2015; Rubin, 2015).
These studies mostly problematized the way people with
intersex variations have been presented in classifications,
historical incidences, or socially. The fourth most common
methods could be considered systematic experimental group
testing/modeling (eight sources) of a novel medical approach
or hypothesis like, for example, Magnetic Resonance
Imaging, Copy Number Variation and cell transgenic experi-
ments, gene network modeling, and so on (Amarillo et al.,
2016; Camats et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; Kelsey et al.,
2016; Kim et al., 2015; Lucas-Herald et al., 2015; Rios et al.,
2015; Topcu et al., 2015). These studies were variably on
zero (Kelsey et al., 2016) to 93 (Lucas-Herald et al., 2015)
participants with intersex variations. The study with no par-
ticipants with intersex variations modeled measures for the
intersex females'internal genitalia based on another group--
only what it termed "healthy females" aged 0 to 40 years
(Kelsey et al., 2016). The pieces gave a strong overall mes-
sage that in the authors' own views, the medical approaches
or hypotheses they had applied had been largely successful
overall.
A less common method (three sources) included the use
of a large-scale survey/questionnaire (Jones, 2016; Lin-Su
et al., 2015; Wang & Tian, 2015). These studies had the most
participants with intersex variations: variably 87 (Wang &
Tian, 2015) to 272 (Jones, 2016). These studies considered
teenagers through to significantly older adults' perspectives
on their own experiences of quality of life, nomenclature,
and/or a combination of medical and social experiences and
services. These studies problematized a range of health care­
related issues including casting use of DSD as a disordering
term and conceptualization (Jones, 2016; Lin-Su et al.,
2015), noting problems with interventions and/or sexual
experiences postinterventions (Jones, 2016; Wang & Tian,
2015), and decrying the lack of direct consultation around
the groups' needs generally in relation to a range of general
health care (Wang & Tian, 2015), mental health (Lin-Su
et al., 2015), and school-based health education services
(Jones, 2016). Another less common method (three sources)
was interviews (Anonymous, 2016; Ediati et al., 2015;
Oliveira et al., 2015). These studies had variably zero
(Anonymous, 2016) to 118 (Ediati et al., 2015) participants

with intersex variations. One article discussed interviews of
parents on how health workers disclosed their child's "DSD"
diagnoses (Oliveira et al., 2015), one discussed an interview
with an expert on interventions (Anonymous, 2016), and one
a set of clinical psychological interviews (Ediati et al., 2015).
Ages of specific interviewees were not consistently clearly
specified in these studies, although participants could mostly
be inferred to be adults. These articles problematized the lack
of health care information dissemination and psychological
follow-up for people with intersex variations from their dif-
ferent stakeholders' perspectives (parents, experts, and
patients). While the Indonesian interviewers argued for inter-
vention based on its infrequency in their context and their
perception was that their context was therefore lacking
(Ediati et al., 2015), the interviewed expert--a nursing clini-
cian from New Zealand--argued that intervention on inter-
sex infants was traumatizing and unnecessary (Anonymous,
2016). One unique study constituted a photographic essay
documentation and analysis of public change and continuity
in Rankin County's LGBTI citizens (Howard, 2015). It was
unclear which or how many participants were specifically
intersex in the original photographic data, or whether the
term LGBTI was simply applied as an umbrella term in an
inclusive spirit or in evaluation of perceived likely participa-
tion. The essay argued that LGBTI people were generally
marginalized in a range of local health and care services.
Framing of Participants and Health-Related
Messages About Interventions
The sources provided a mixture of messages about health care
intervention for people with intersex variations: 27 sources
cast medical interventions as potentially problematic for the
group's health or well-being (Amanda, 2015; Anderson,
2015; Anonymous, 2016; Baratz & Karkazis, 2015; Cynthia,
2015; Davis, 2015b; Dreger, 2015; Frader, 2015; Garcia,
2015; Grimes, 2016; Inter, 2015; Jones, 2016; Kraus, 2015;
Lalor, 2015; Long, 2015; Miller, 2015; Pagonis, 2015;
Petersen, 2015; Quinn, 2015; Saraswat et al., 2015; Simon,
2015; Truffer, 2015; Viloria, 2015; von Klan, 2015; Wall,
2015; Walsh, 2015; Zieselman, 2015). Nineteen cast inter-
ventions as unproblematic (Achermann et al., 2015; Ahmed
& Fadl-Elmula, 2016; Amarillo et al., 2016; Bonanni et al.,
2015; Brasileiro et al., 2016; Ceci et al., 2015; Dong et al.,
2016; Ediati et al., 2015; Ekenze et al., 2015; Grimbly et al.,
2016; Kelsey et al., 2016; Khadilkar et al., 2015; Latrech
et al., 2015; Lucas-Herald et al., 2015; Mannaerts et al., 2015;
Mutlu et al., 2015; Palanisamy et al., 2015; Paula et al., 2015;
Wang & Tian, 2015), and 15 presented unclarified/mixed
views (Camats et al., 2015; Dwyer et al., 2015; Grover et al.,
2015; Gül et al., 2015; Howard, 2015; Kalra et al., 2016; Kim
et al., 2015; Lin-Su et al., 2015; Mohamed & Noor, 2015;
Oliveira et al., 2015; Rios et al., 2015; Rubin, 2015; Tinney
et al., 2015; Topcu et al., 2015; Vasundhera et al., 2016).
These messages roughly aligned with the use of nomenclature
and sometimes certain theoretical lenses. Noticeably, the
strongest divide was between the use of community-related
terms and medically related terms (Figure 3). Over a third of
sources (26 of 61, including all 18 sources using the Bioethical
Narrative Inquiry theoretical lens) applied the term "intersex"
to the group, largely framing the group as a marginalized
group with specific service needs, sex traits not considered
standard socially/theologically, and a need for protection
from unwanted discrimination (Amanda, 2015; Anonymous,
2016; Baratz & Karkazis, 2015; Cynthia, 2015; Davis, 2015b;
Dreger, 2015; Frader, 2015; Garcia, 2015; Grimes, 2016;
Jones 9
Inter, 2015; Jones, 2016; Kalra et al., 2016; Kraus, 2015;
Long, 2015; Pagonis, 2015; Petersen, 2015; Quinn, 2015;
Rubin, 2015; Simon, 2015; Tinney et al., 2015; Truffer, 2015;
Viloria, 2015; von Klan, 2015; Wall, 2015; Walsh, 2015;
Zieselman, 2015). Some studies using this nomenclature
included people with specific variations, including, for exam-
ple, 47XXY, AIS, CAH, Kallman's, Klinefelter's, PCOS-
related hyperandrogenism, and over 40 others (Jones, 2016);
while other studies were more generalized in discussing indi-
viduals born with sexual anatomies that various societies
deem to be nonstandard (Rubin, 2015), or "endocrinology-
related features" that can be read as intersex (Kalra et al.,
2016). A few studies applying Queer conceptualizations of
the word intersex described the group as disrupting the sex
binary (male/female) or dominant sex and gender discourse
(Grimes, 2016). Most sources using the "intersex" nomencla-
ture cast the group as unfairly subjected to cosmetic surgery
in problematic ways as infants and young people with nega-
tive outcomes for their health and well-being (Anonymous,
2016), and having largely unheard perspectives on their
choices and negative experiences that needed to be privileged
(Davis, 2015b). These studies called for greater consultation
in health care, health care policy production, and the develop-
ment of mental health services.
A similar portion of sources (24 of 61, including 20 of the
23 sources featuring the Traditional Clinical/Medical theo-
retical lens) applied the phrase "patients with disorders of
sex development/DSD" to the group, largely framing the
group as containing smaller groups of patients with specific
sets of disorders to be analyzed, with a range of medical
needs sometimes confronting to family or medical staff
(Achermann et al., 2015; Ahmed & Fadl-Elmula, 2016;
Amarillo et al., 2016; Brasileiro et al., 2016; Camats et al.,
2015; Dong et al., 2016; Ediati et al., 2015; Ekenze et al.,
2015; Grimbly et al., 2016; Gül et al., 2015; Kelsey et al.,
2016; Khadilkar et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015; Latrech et al.,
2015; Mannaerts et al., 2015; Mohamed & Noor, 2015;
Mutlu et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2015; Paula et al., 2015;
Rios et al., 2015; Saraswat et al., 2015; Topcu et al., 2015;
Vasundhera et al., 2016; Wang & Tian, 2015). Sometimes,
concepts considered offensive or inaccurate to community
members were applied as types of subclassifications where
this DSD language was used, such as pieces casting the
group as presenting in "pseudohermaphroditism"/"true her-
maphroditism" (Gül et al., 2015) and having "abnormal"
chromosomal, hormonal, or anatomical traits (Ahmed &
Fadl-Elmula, 2016). Several of the studies actually con-
trasted the group against what they termed "normal" people
in terms of anatomy or other traits (Camats et al., 2015).
There was a strong focus in sources using DSD nomencla-
ture on the cause of the group's "abnormal" traits (Camats
et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015; Topcu et al., 2015); the need for
managing parents' experiences of shock and stigma and aid-
ing their intervention choices for their child rather than
patient choice (Achermann et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2015);
and an assumption of the value and success of early interven-
tion (Paula et al., 2015). A smaller group (four of 61) exclu-
sively used the specific diagnosis or condition in focus only,
framing the group in terms of particular condition-based
traits and risks (Bonanni et al., 2015; Lin-Su et al., 2015;
Lucas-Herald et al., 2015; Palanisamy et al., 2015). These
included patients with persistent mullerian duct syndrome
(PMDS; Palanisamy et al., 2015), patients with CAH (Lin-Su
et al., 2015), patients with Turner syndrome (TS; Bonanni
et al., 2015), and children with suspected disorders of ste-
roid/hormone synthesis (Lucas-Herald et al., 2015). The
sources using group-specific nomenclature were mostly
affirming and unquestioning about the need for early analy-
sis and intervention, although one considered the need for
greater consultation with the patient group (Lin-Su et al.,
2015).
There was a small portion of sources (four of 61, including
all sources using the Critical LGBTI Liberationist theoretical
lens) that mainly applied the phrase "lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and intersex/LGBTI" or similar acronyms
(Dwyer et al., 2015; Howard, 2015; Lalor, 2015; Miller,
2015), whether the specific acronym LGBTI (Howard, 2015;
Lalor,2015),LGBTIQ(Dwyeretal.,2015),orLGBT*IAGCQ
youth (*IAGCQ included intersex, agender/asexual, gender
creative, and questioning) was used (Miller, 2015). These
sources framed the group within a broader politically and
socially marginalized community, usually with rights protec-
tions in law, policy, or ethical frames which need to be
asserted. Even within this group, the intersex people were
cast as the subgroup for which mental health information,
specifically for older people, was most minimal (Tinney
et al., 2015). These studies took mixed or neutral approaches
to corrective intervention, however, not collectively provid-
ing critique or endorsement. Finally, the smallest portion
(three of 61 sources, including two using the Traditional
Clinical/Medical theoretical lens) applied the phrase
"Disorders of sexual differentiation/DSD," a term used in a
similar manner to the other DSD acronym with emphasis on
sex trait and genital ambiguity (Anderson, 2015; Ceci et al.,
2015; Grover et al., 2015). Perhaps this was intended to be
less pathologizing--although given it was used in one of the
articles used in conjunction with the terms "disorder" and
"hermaphroditism," the possibility of any depathologizing
rationale was in question (Ceci et al., 2015). No clear rela-
tionship between this nomenclature and approaches to health
care or intervention could be determined.
Discussion
The data suggested a developing divergence in the literature
from the long-established location of health-related studies
on people with intersex variations within the institutional
expert-based orientation, particularly Traditional Medical/
10 SAGE Open
Clinical framings and their remaining overall dominant con-
centration in medical journals. This was particularly affected
by not only American and Australian work, for example, but
also other contexts. Clearly, more patient-centered, commu-
nity-centered, and theory-centered work is emerging in this
field--particularly a range of Critical Bioethics and Intersex
Studies perspectives which have emerged and are actively
challenging the way this group is framed. This has included
a trend toward new nomenclature and considerations. In this
literature review, the large number of expert-centered sources
promoting interventionalist pathologizing views on "patients
with DSDs" were equaled by the large number of community
group­centered and other sources promoting a critique of
these dominant health care attitudes on the basis of marginal-
ized "intersex" peoples' perspectives, bodily autonomy, and
rights. This reflected broader debates in the field discussed in
other papers chronicling recent resistance to the assumption
people with intersex variations need cosmetic correction
from international human rights organizations, Queer theo-
retical work, and community-based sources (Davis, 2015a;
Jones et al., 2016; OII Australia, 2012a; Turner, 1999; United
Nations, 2012). This literature evidenced a shift toward a
view of medical intervention as problematic.
However, older conceptualizations of clinicians as having
unmitigated rights over patients remain in a significant portion
of the literature--this was particularly evident in the lack of
consideration some researchers gave to patients' perspectives
on their health care in the sources, and moreover the problem-
atic use of photographs of participants'external genitalia illus-
trated in several case studies. Researchers are in an extremely
powerful position over these studies'participants (especially if
their participants are also their patients and at their mercy for
medical care, moreover if they are children). People with
intersex variations have complained about feelings of being
abused in medical and research scenarios where their varia-
tions were shared without their permission, let alone access to
their bodies (especially their genitalia) whether put on display
or touched and photographed (Jones et al., 2016).Anonymized
diagrams would have sufficed in outlining specific anatomical
indicators of intersex variations without compromising an
individual patient's respectful treatment (recalling the lack of
glove use) or right to control over their genitalia and its depic-
tion (recalling that permissions were either unobtainable for
infants or not reported from adults).Alimitation of this review
is that it is unclear from examining the literature itself with
whom the responsibility would legally lie to ensure permis-
sions for procedures or photographs were obtained, or if any
such responsibility is allocated in various global contexts. In
future, clinicians will need to start listening to the growing
push from people with intersex variations for greater consul-
tancy around interventions impacting sex traits (especially
hormones and genitalia) by ideally holding off on such inter-
vention and only pursuing it in consultation with and consider-
ation of the recipient (at an age where this is possible).Another
limit of this review is that constructions of ages by which
informed consent might be possible were not examined; this is
an area for researchers and policy makers to start considering.
To a smaller extent, another concern in the literature was that
publications claiming to be on "LGBTI" people appeared not
to have been reviewed for whether they actually contain peo-
ple with intersex variations; this issue could be better addressed
in advice given to researchers from both ethics committees in
research institutions and research publishers and peer-review-
ers, as relevant. Intersex activists have mixed views on inclu-
sion in LGBTI studies--some argue heteronormativity marks
intersex bodies as "queer bodies" making LGBTI and anti-
homophobia perspectives applicable (Holmes, 1994). Others
argue that LGBTI work exposes intersex people to added
homophobia and "pinkwashing"--having their goals depriori-
tized against gay groups' goals (Koyama & Weasel, 2001;
Pagonis, 2016).
Conclusion
Clinicians' analyses of clinical processes around people
with intersex variations may indeed provide some valuable
information and cast intervention work in affirming ways.
However, external analyses from lenses that really privilege
people with intersex variations themselves as agentic sub-
jects in a more empowering dynamic, than simply a patient-
object, show a strong disconnection between how clinicians
and people with intersex variations consider health care pro-
vision. Notably, there has been an increasing level of con-
sultancy with patient advocate groups in some contexts in
recent years, and major shifts away from performing unnec-
essary procedures on infants (in the reported experiences of
both the author, who has worked with Government Advisory
Groups on intersex policy issues in Victoria Australia, and
of members of this article's peer review team). It is impor-
tant for more clinicians to respond to the largely commu-
nity-based and rights-based pushes for a patient-centered
model of intersex health care. Patient-centered care litera-
ture broadly privileges principles of prioritizing an individ-
ual patient's goals and well-being, building a relationship
which empowers a patient, making accessible clinician
communication with the patient routine, and using patient
experience narratives and feedback toward service improve-
ment (Koyama & Weasel, 2001). A patient-centered
approach to patients with intersex variations would there-
fore foreground greater valuing of the holistic well-being of
the individual in the long term, their diverse needs and iden-
tity potentials, their possible fertility and hormone balance,
their sexual function (not just in a simplistic valuing of pen-
etrative sex but in a valuing of the full range of human sex-
ual pleasures and possibilities), and their many other
autonomous considerations only discoverable through plac-
ing proper consultation and support processes in place in all
clinical settings. It would acknowledge that many patients
Jones 11
later in life have bodily autonomy goals which differ from
guardians' goals to have their childrens' bodies become
"normalised" (Jones et al., 2016). Contemporary clinicians
should seek and prioritize their patient's own language and
goals around their intersex variations and bodily difference
(rather than imposing DSD terminology), should acknowl-
edge that young patient's goals may ultimately differ from
their family's goals long term through putting off any unnec-
essary interventions until the patient is old enough to seek
them out and give informed consent, and should source
patient support information from large-scale internationally
recognized intersex organizations (including those for all
intersex people such as OII, and local chapters for patients'
specific variations such as TS and AIS societies).
Similarly, research institutions, researchers, and publish-
ers could take a more active share in the responsibility of
avoiding the exploitation of people with intersex variations
through the health-related studies they publish. This could
include standardizing indicator questions for people with
congenital intersex variations (so that studies claiming inter-
sex participants must actually include them), and standard-
izing requirements of evidence of informed consent for any
external genitalia photography published or even key prob-
lematic intervention practices described within studies pub-
lished (such as cosmetic genital surgeries). Indeed, the divide
between the clinical and the nonclinical literature exposes
possibilities for improving not only treatment outcomes but
also opportunities for changing the relationship between bio-
medical expertise and patient- and theory-centered knowl-
edge production. In particular, involving diverse groups of
people with intersex variations in research development and
knowledge development around biomedical and theoretical
knowledge, and in the creation of success measures for treat-
ment evaluations, would be key steps forward. Methods
might include (but are not limited to) involving intersex peo-
ple in study reference groups, focus groups, professional
development training sessions, or paid consultants and team
members. Where LGBTI work seeks to include intersex peo-
ple, this should be achieved directly via consultation with
intersex groups and active recruitment strategies, to over-
come tendencies toward pinkwashing or assuming intersex
people are included where they are not (Holmes, 1994;
United Nations, 2012). LGBTI work should only include
intersex people where their goals align with the work or are
actively prioritized in the work, and where an understanding
of the particular impacts of homophobia on intersex people
can be understood and worked against. A pro-active stance
toward aligning the range of perspectives on health care for
people with intersex variations needs to be taken by a range
of stakeholders (from policy makers to health care providers
and publishers) if the tensions are to be resolved in this
field--and ultimately used to improve it.
