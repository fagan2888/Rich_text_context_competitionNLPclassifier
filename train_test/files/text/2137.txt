LIFE expectancy in the United States has increased
dramatically over the course of the past century (Arias,
Rostron, & Tejada-Vera, 2010), and with it has come
increased burden of medical comorbidity related to aging.
According to a recent report from the 2004 Medical Expen-
ditures Panel Survey, 49% of all adults in the United States
have at least one chronic medical condition and 26% have
two or more.Among those aged 65 years or older, 72% have
two or more conditions (Anderson, 2007). Living with med-
ical comorbidity has thus become the norm for older adults,
and the extent to which one can live well with multiple
chronic conditions is a pressing challenge for an aging
society. We address this challenge in several ways. First, we
examine the associations of medical comorbidity with mul-
tiple domains of psychological functioning in a national
sample of middle-aged and older adults, placing particular
emphasis on positive functioning. Second, and most impor-
tantly, we determine whether maintaining relatively high
levels of well-being in the face of medical comorbidity will
afford biological advantages in the form of lower levels of
systemic inflammation. Finally, we sharpen the focus on
positive functioning by assessing its independence from
negative affect and refine the analyses further by examining
the potential role of health behaviors as mediators of links
between positive psychological functioning and inflamma-
tion in the context of medical comorbidity.
Declines in health present a primary threat to subjective
well-being in later life. Although older adults tend to report
higher levels of subjective well-being (across multiple
domains of well-being) than younger adults (George, 2010),
health problems are linked to significantly lower levels of
positive affect and life satisfaction and higher levels of
depression and depressive symptoms in both cross-sectional
and longitudinal analyses (Gerstorf et al., 2010; Kunzmann,
Little, & Smith, 2000; Mroczek & Spiro, 2005; Strawbridge,
Wallhagen, & Cohen, 2002). Health-related declines in
well-being are particularly steep for those nearing the
end of life (Gerstorf et al., 2010; Mroczek & Spiro, 2005)
Nevertheless, mean levels of subjective well-being remain
relatively high among adults with poor health. Indeed, many
older adults consider themselves to be aging successfully,
despite having multiple chronic conditions (Strawbridge et
al., 2002; Weir, Meisner, & Baker, 2010). These latter
observations suggest that high levels of subjective well-
being may be present in contexts of medical comorbidities,
which we investigate in the current study.
We bring two distinct domains of psychological
well-being --hedonic and eudaimonic (Ryan & Deci, 2001;
Waterman, 1993)--to the inquiry. Hedonic well-being is as-
sociated with pleasure, contentment, and the avoidance of
physical and psychic discomfort. It is typically assessed
using the frequency and intensity of positive and negative

Objectives. We take a biopsychosocial perspective on age-related diseases by examining psychological correlates of
having multiple chronic conditions and determining whether positive psychological functioning predicts advantageous
profiles of biological risk factors.
Method. Respondents to the national survey of Midlife in the United States who participated in clinical assessments
of health and biological processes (n = 998) provided information on chronic medical conditions and multiple domains
of psychological functioning. Serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were deter-
mined from fasting blood samples.
Results. Life satisfaction declined with increasing comorbidity while negative affect increased. In contrast, positive
affect, purpose in life, and positive relations with others were unrelated to comorbidity status. Significant interactions
showed that although IL-6 and CRP increased with increasing number of chronic conditions, respondents with higher
levels of purpose in life, positive relations with others, and (in the case of CRP) positive affect had lower levels of inflam-
mation compared with those with lower well-being scores.
Discussion. The results suggest that many older adults with medical comorbidities maintain high levels of positive
psychological functioning that are in turn linked to better profiles of biological disease risk.

mood and ratings of life satisfaction (Diener, 2000; Ryan &
Deci, 2001). Studies of health-related changes in well-being
typically involve hedonic measures, such as life satisfaction
(Mroczek & Spiro, 2005), positive and negative affect
(Kunzmann et al., 2000), or a combination of these (Gerstorf
et al., 2010). In contrast, eudaimonic well-being stems from
the Aristotelian ideal of the pursuit of personal excellence
(Ryan & Deci, 2001; Waterman, 1993) and has been opera-
tionalized with Ryff's Psychological Well-Being (PWB)
scales (Ryff & Keyes, 1995). Here, we focus on two specific
dimensions of psychological well-being--purpose in life
and positive relations with others--that predicted inflam-
mation in our earlier work (Friedman, Hayney, Love,
Singer, & Ryff, 2007). Purpose in life has also been recently
linked to reduced mortality (Boyle, Barnes, Buchman, &
Bennett, 2009). To our knowledge, links between eudai-
monic well-being and medical comorbidity have not yet
been studied.
A central aim of this study was to determine whether
higher levels of positive psychological functioning in adults
with medical comorbidities will afford biological advan-
tages in the form of lower circulating levels of inflammatory
proteins. Some of the chronic conditions most common in
aging individuals--cardiovascular disease, hypertension,
and diabetes--are associated with higher circulating levels
of inflammatory proteins (Abraham et al., 2007; Blake &
Ridker, 2003; Cesari et al., 2003; Chae, Lee, Rifai, & Ridker,
2001; Fernandez-Real & Ricart, 2003) such as the proin-
flammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the acute-
phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP). Importantly, IL-6
and CRP have also been linked prospectively with adverse
health outcomes, including mortality, in individuals with a
range of clinical diagnoses (Aggarwal & Gehlot, 2009;
Blake & Ridker, 2003; Leitch et al., 2007). This connection
between inflammation and adverse health outcomes is
particularly strong in elderly adults (Stork et al., 2006)
who also likely suffer from multiple medical comorbidities.
Inflammation thus provides a useful index of risk for future
mortality and morbidity among those with comorbid
clinical illnesses, especially older adults.
Importantly, inflammation is also associated with both
positive and negative aspects of psychosocial functioning.
A recent meta-analysis of 136 studies published between
1967 and 2008 found that inflammatory proteins, predomi-
nantly IL-6 and CRP, are positively associated with depres-
sion (Howren, Lamkin, & Suls, 2009). This association
was dose dependent and equally evident in clinical and
community-based samples (Howren et al., 2009). Positive
psychosocial functioning, in contrast, has been linked to
lower levels of inflammation. Circulating levels of IL-6
were lower in two independent samples of older women
who reported higher levels of psychological well-being
(Friedman et al., 2007; Friedman, Love, Singer, & Ryff,
2008), and greater positive affect predicted lower levels of
IL-6 and CRP in female, but not in male, participants from the
Whitehall II study (Steptoe, O'Donnell, Badrick, Kumari, &
Marmot, 2008). The degree to which psychological func-
tioning may moderate the link between chronic illness and
inflammation is unknown, although the possibility is sup-
ported by earlier research showing that high-quality social
relationships predict lower levels of IL-6 in women with
advanced ovarian cancer (Costanzo et al., 2005). We test
this possibility in the present study.
We also examine whether any links between positive psy-
chological functioning and inflammation in adults with
medical comorbidities are independent of negative affect.
Broadly, well-being and ill-being are considered to be con-
structs that are related but distinct, and although the two are
typically inversely correlated, the correlation is rarely per-
fect or even strong (Diener, 1984). Importantly, there is both
a theoretical foundation for and an empirical evidence of
the possibility of experiencing positive and negative emo-
tions at the same time over the same event (Cacioppo &
Berntson, 1994; Larsen, McGraw, & Cacioppo, 2001;
Norris, Gollan, Berntson, & Cacioppo, 2010), and neurosci-
ence research has shown that positive and negative emotions
involve different regions of the brain (Cacioppo & Berntson,
1999). Of particular relevance for this study are two recent
literature reviews showing that higher levels of well-being
predict better health and reduced mortality, and studies that
have accounted for ill-being typically find residual associa-
tions between well-being and multiple indices of health
(Chida & Steptoe, 2008; Pressman & Cohen, 2005).
Finally, we assess the potential role of three health
behaviors--cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and
physical activity--in mediating links between positive
psychological functioning and inflammation in the context
of medical comorbidities. Smoking is linked to higher
circulating levels of inflammatory proteins (Helmersson,
Larsson, Vessby, & Basu, 2005), whereas light alcohol
intake (Volpato et al., 2004) and regular physical activity
(Colbert et al., 2004) are associated with lower levels. Indi-
viduals with higher levels of well-being are generally more
likely to engage in good health behaviors, and health behav-
iors are thought to contribute to the relationship between pos-
itive psychological functioning and better health outcomes
(Steptoe, Dockray, & Wardle, 2009). Using a well-established
approach to meditational analyses (Baron & Kenny, 1986),
we examine the extent to which health behaviors explain
the association of positive psychological functioning and
inflammation in adults with medical comorbidities.
We test the following hypotheses:
· Positive psychological functioning will decline and nega-
tive functioning will increase with increasing number of
chronic conditions, but consistent with research on older
adult well-being (George, 2010), overall levels of subjec-
tive well-being will remain relatively high.
· At similar levels of comorbidity, higher levels of subjec-
tive well-being predict lower levels of IL-6 and CRP.

· The links between positive psychological functioning and
inflammation, as well as the interactive association with
chronic conditions, will be independent of negative affect.
· Health behaviors will mediate, at least in part, the associ-
ation of psychological functioning measures (and their
interactions with chronic conditions) and inflammation.
Method
Participants
Data for the current study are from the longitudinal sur-
vey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), a national
study of the physical and mental health of middle-aged and
older adults. MIDUS comprises a national probability
sample of noninstitutionalized English-speaking adults (N =
3,487) living in the coterminus United States and recruited
by random digit dialing (RDD). A sample of monozygotic
and dizygotic twin pairs (N = 1,914) was also recruited from
a national twin registry. The first wave of MIDUS data
collection (MIDUS 1) was completed in 1995­1996, and a
follow-up study (MIDUS 2) was completed in 2004­2006.
Mortality-adjusted retention from the original study was
71% for the RDD sample and 82% for the twins.All respon-
dents completed telephone interviews and self-administered
questionnaires. Data collection for MIDUS 2 included an
oversampling of African Americans living in Milwaukee
County, but given marked differences in sociodemographic
and biological variables compared with the RDD and twin
samples, the Milwaukee oversample is excluded from these
analyses.
A subsample of MIDUS 2 RDD and twin respondents
(N = 1,028) participated in a detailed clinic-based assess-
ment of health, disease-related biomarkers, and physiologi-
cal function ("biomarker sample"). Recruitment was by
letter and a follow-up telephone call, and data collection
was completed in 2004­2009. Participation in the bio-
marker sample was open to all MIDUS 2 respondents who
had completed the telephone interview and self-administered
questionnaires and were willing to travel to a general
clinical research center (GCRC) for an overnight stay.
Recruitment was by letter and a follow-up telephone call.
Compared with the full MIDUS 2 sample, participants in
the biomarker sample were more likely to have graduated
from a 4-year college, were more likely to be Caucasian,
and had higher scores on purpose in life, but were otherwise
no different.Although the inclusion of respondents from the
twins sample has not influenced the results of previous
analyses involving MIDUS data (Friedman, Williams,
Singer, & Ryff, 2009), we accounted for possible effects of
genetic and familial relatedness among the twins here by
including a variable indicating twin status in all analyses.
CRP values in excess of 10 mg/L are thought to indicate
acute infectious illness, and exclusion of cases with high
CRP values is recommended. We identified 30 cases with
high CRP values, yielding a final analytical sample of 998
respondents.
Three regional GCRCs participated in the MIDUS bio-
marker study--one on the West coast, one in the Midwest,
and one on the East coast--and participants were invited to
stay at whichever GCRC imposed the least travel burden.
Upon arrival at the GCRC, each respondent provided a
detailed medical history interview with a GCRC clinician.
Participants were also asked to bring all current medications
to the GCRC, and these were inventoried by the project
staff. Fasting blood samples were obtained the next morning
between 08:00 and 10:00 a.m. Serum was isolated from all
samples, aliquoted, frozen at -80 °C, shipped on dry ice to
the appropriate laboratory, and stored at -80 °C for analyses.
The time between completion of questionnaires and collec-
tion of blood samples varied from simultaneously to several
years. To ensure that this variability did not confound the
analyses, a variable for time between data collection points
was included in all analyses.
Collection of data for MIDUS 2 and analysis of those
data for the current study were both approved by the Health
Sciences Institutional Review Board at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.
Measures
Chronic conditions.--Participants indicated whether they
had received a physician diagnosis for any of 12 chronic
conditions. These included autoimmune disorders, cardio-
vascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, arthri-
tis, asthma, diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases, liver disease,
and cancer. From these responses, an index of total chronic
disease conditions was constructed with possible responses
ranging from 0 to 12.
Inflammatory proteins.--Serum IL-6 from fasting blood
samples was measured using a high-sensitivity enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufactur-
er's guidelines (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in the
laboratory of Dr. Christopher Coe at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. CRP was measured using a particle-
enhanced immunonephelometric assay (BNII nephelometer;
Dade Behring, Inc., Deerfield, IL) in the laboratory of
Dr. Russell Tracy at the University of Vermont. The labora-
tory intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variance for
both proteins were in acceptable ranges (<10%). As is
typically seen, distributions for both IL-6 and CRP were
positively skewed, and data were log transformed for statis-
tical analyses. Due to cases where blood samples were
missing or had inadequate volume for assays, analyses for
IL-6 involved 988 participants, whereas those for CRP
involved 984 participants. Circulating levels of IL-6 typi-
cally increase with age and range from less than 1 pg/ml in
young adults to more than 2.5 pg/ml in older adults (Ferrucci
et al., 2005).

Eudaimonic well-being.--Assessments of purpose in life
and positive relations with others were based on responses
to 2 seven-item subscales from Ryff's PWB inventory (Ryff &
Keyes, 1995). Examples of items from the purpose-in-life
scale include "I enjoy making plans for the future and working
to make them a reality" and "I sometimes feel as if I've
done all there is to do in life" (reverse scored). Examples of
items from the positive-relations-with-others scale include
"I know that I can trust my friends, and they know they can
trust me" and "Maintaining close relationships has been
difficult and frustrating for me" (reverse scored). Internal
validity alphas for purpose in life and positive relations with
others for the biomarker sample were .69 and .78, respec-
tively. These are almost identical to the internal validity sta-
tistics for the full MIDUS 2 sample (.70 and .78, respectively).
Hedonic well-being.--Positive and negative affect were
measured using adjectives from the Positive and Negative
Affect Scale (PANAS; Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998). For posi-
tive affect, respondents were asked to indicate how often in
the past 30 days they felt "enthusiastic," "attentive,"
"proud," or "active" and to respond using a 5-point scale
(1 = all of the time; 5 = none of the time). Negative adjec-
tives were "afraid," "jittery," "irritable," "ashamed," and
"upset." Internal validity (determined from the biomarker
sample) was .85 for the positive adjectives and .80 for the
negative ones. These are comparable with internal validity
assessments from the full MIDUS 2 sample (alphas = .90
and .86 for positive and negative affect, respectively).
Life satisfaction was assessed using a single item: "At
present, how satisfied are you with your life?" Responses
ranged from 1 = a lot to 4 = not at all.
Covariates
In addition to age, sex, marital status, educational attain-
ment, and race, analyses controlled for the potential con-
founding influence of risk factors for poor health, most
notably obesity and use of medications that may affect the
inflammatory proteins, and health behaviors.
Education.--Participants were asked about their highest
level of educational attainment. Responses were grouped into
12 categories ranging from "no school/some grade school" to
"PhD, MD, JD, or other professional degrees." Responses
were then grouped into three categories--high school degree
or Graduate Equivalency Degree, some college, and college
degree or more--and this variable was used in all analyses.
Obesity.--Height and weight were measured by the
GCRC staff and used to calculate body mass index (BMI;
weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in
meters). A continuous measure of BMI was included in all
analyses. Waist and hip circumferences were measured
directly on skin or over a single layer of clothing (e.g.,
camisole or undershirt) using a tape measure. A continuous
measure of waist-to-hip ratio was used in all analyses.
Medications.--Antihypertensive (Fliser, Buchholz, &
Haller, 2004; Tatli & Kurum, 2005), cholesterol-lowering
(Jain & Ridker, 2005), and antidepressant (Kenis & Maes,
2002) medications have all been shown to have anti-
inflammatory properties, and steroid medications, particu-
larly as part of a hormone replacement regimen, have
been shown to increase CRP levels (Silvestri et al., 2003).
Dichotomous variables indicating the use of any of these
medications were included in all analyses.
Health behavior.--Health behavior indicators are based
on self-reported information from questionnaires completed
at the GCRC. Participants were asked about history of ciga-
rette smoking, and the responses were coded as never
smoked, former smoker, or current smoker. Participants
also indicated the number of drinks consumed during an
average day, and the responses were categorized (none, 1­2,
3 or more). Finally, respondents were asked whether they
engage in regular exercise or physical activity for 20 min
or more at least 3 times per week, and the responses were
categorized as yes or no.
Statistical Analyses
Bivariate associations between key predictor and out-
come variables were initially assessed. Hierarchical multi-
variate linear regression models were then used to estimate
the independent and interactive associations of chronic
conditions and well-being measures with inflammatory
proteins--separate models were estimated for IL-6 and
CRP. Initial models examined direct associations between
each inflammatory protein and chronic conditions and
well-being, and the Well-being × Chronic Conditions inter-
action net of the effects of age, sex, race, educational attain-
ment, and marital status. To examine the independence of
well-being measures and negative affect, the models for
positive affect, purpose in life, and positive relations with
others then added the variable for negative affect from
the PANAS (Model 2). Finally, to determine whether the
aspects of health behavior accounted for associations of
hedonic or eudaimonic well-being measures and inflamma-
tory markers, Model 3 added BMI, waist­hip ratio, medica-
tions, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and exercise.
Collinearity diagnostics indicated that associations among
these measures were not sufficiently great to compromise
the models. The threshold for statistically significant associ-
ations was  = .05.

Bivariate Associations
Table 2 displays bivariate associations among the key
predictor and outcomes variables as well as the covariates.
IL-6 (r = .29, p < .01) and CRP (r = .17, p < .01) were both
significantly positively correlated with the number of
chronic conditions. Number of chronic conditions was
significantly positively correlated with negative affect (r =
.07, p < .05) and negatively correlated with life satisfaction
(r = -.08, p < .05) but not associated with other measures of
psychological functioning. IL-6 was inversely associated
with purpose in life (r = -.07, p < .05), positive affect
(r =-.09, p < .01), and life satisfaction (r = -.06, p < .05),
and CRP was negatively correlated with life satisfaction
(r = -.07, p < .05) and positively correlated with positive
relations with others (r = .08, p < .05). Finally, measures of
hedonic and eudaimonic well-being were all moderately
correlated with one another.
Regression Analyses
Interleukin-6.--The results of the regression analyses for
IL-6 are shown in Table 3.
After adjustment for age, sex, race, educational attain-
ment, marital status, sample type (RDD vs. twin), and time
elapsed between data collections (base model), chronic con-
ditions were positively associated with IL-6 ( = .21, p <
.01), and this association remained significant albeit dimin-
ished after the addition of other covariates ( = .09, p < .05).
Purpose in life was not associated with IL-6 in the base
model or after adjustments for health and health behavior
covariates. In contrast, the interaction between chronic con-
ditions and purpose in life was significantly associated with
IL-6 in the base model (Model 1:  = -.43, p < .05), and this
association was maintained after controlling for negative
affect (Model 2:  = -.43, p < .05) and other covariates
(Model 3:  = -.36, p < .05).
Positive relations with others was marginally signifi-
cantly associated with IL-6 in both the base model (Model
1:  = .10, p = .05) and after adjustments for negative affect
(Model 2:  = .10, p = .05), but this association was reduced
to statistical nonsignificance after inclusion of health and
health behavior covariates (Model 3:  = .08, p > .05). The
interaction of positive relations with others and chronic
conditions was significant in the base model (Model 1:
 = -.37, p = .05), and after controlling for negative affect
(Model 2:  = -.38, p < .05), but was reduced to marginal
significance after adjustment for health and health behavior
covariates (Model 3:  = -.32, p = .08).

Positive affect was marginally associated with IL-6 in the
base (Model 1:  = -.10, p = .06) and full models (Model 3:
 = -10, p = .06), and significantly associated with IL-6 in
the model after adjusting for negative affect (Model 2:  =
-.12, p < .05). The interaction between positive affect and
chronic conditions was not significantly associated with
IL-6 in any of the models (see Table 3). Neither life satisfac-
tion nor the interaction between life satisfaction and chronic
conditions was significantly associated with IL-6 in any of
the models (see Table 3). Similarly, negative affect and the
interaction of negative affect and chronic conditions did not
significantly predict IL-6 in any of the models (see Table 3).
C-reactive protein.--The results of the regression
analyses for CRP are shown in Table 4.
Chronic conditions were significantly associated with
CRP in the base model ( = .17, p < .001), but the associa-
tion was reduced to marginal significance in the full model
( = .07, p = .05).
Purpose in life was significantly associated with CRP in
the base model (Model 1:  = .11, p < .05; Table 4), but this
association became marginally significant after adjusting
for negative affect (Model 2:  = .09, p = .09). Interestingly,
purpose in life predicted CRP in the full model (Model 3:
 = .10, p < .05), suggesting modest suppression effects
associated with the health and health behavior covariates. The
interaction between chronic conditions and purpose in life
was consistently significantly related to CRP in all the three
models (see Table 4).
Positive relations with others was significantly associated
with CRP in all models (see Table 4). The interaction of
positive relations with others and chronic conditions was
significant in the base model and after controlling for nega-
tive affect but was reduced to marginal significance in the
full model (Model 3:  = -.33, p = .06).
Positive affect was marginally associated with CRP in the
base model (Model 1:  = .09, p = .09), but this association
was reduced to nonsignificance after adjustment for nega-
tive affect and other covariates (see Table 4). The interac-
tion between positive affect and chronic conditions was
significant in the base model ( = -.36, p < .05) and after
adjustment for negative affect (Model 2:  = -.36, p < .05),
but nonsignificant after adjustment for health and health
behavior covariates ( = -.19, p > .05). Life satisfaction,
negative affect, and their respective interactions with
chronic conditions were not significantly associated with
CRP in any of the models (see Table 4).
The interactions of chronic conditions with measures of
hedonic and eudaimonic well-being are shown in Figure 1.
Analytic Refinements
We probed the aforementioned results in three ways to
clarify their interpretation. First, the significant bivariate
association between purpose in life and positive relations
with others (r = .58, p < .01) raises the question of whether
the associations of each domain of eudaimonic well-being
with IL-6 and CRP were independent of each other. To
address this question, positive relations with others was
included in the regression models relating purpose in life to
both IL-6 and CRP--and vice versa--and the results
showed that neither the associations with the well-being

variable nor the association of the relevant interaction term
was affected (data not shown). As noted previously, collin-
earity diagnostics indicated that inclusion of both variables
in the same model did not compromise the model.
Second, hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being
are considered as related but distinct constructs (Keyes,
Shmotkin, & Ryff, 2002). To determine whether these dif-
ferent aspects of well-being shared their associations with
inflammatory proteins or were independent, we included
positive affect in the regression models for purpose in life
and positive relations with others. In every instance, inclu-
sion of positive affect left the coefficients for eudaimonic
well-being measures virtually identical.
Finally, IL-6 is a potent stimulator of the synthesis and
release of CRP from the liver (Mortensen, 2001; Tennent
et al., 2007), and we recently reported that the association of
income and CRP was mediated by IL-6 (Friedman & Herd,
2010). To examine a possible mediating role for IL-6 in
these analyses, IL-6 was added to the full CRP models.
With the exception of the interaction between chronic
conditions and positive relations with others, which was
reduced to marginal statistical significance (p = .08), associ-
ations were unchanged (data not shown).
Discussion
This study examined the psychological correlates of
multiple disease comorbidity in a national sample of middle-
aged and older adults in the United States. Consistent with
prior literature on subjective well-being (Fortin, Dubois,
Hudon, Soubhi, & Almirall, 2007; Kunzmann et al., 2000;
Mroczek & Spiro, 2005; Strawbridge et al., 2002), we found
that life satisfaction declined with increasing number of
chronic conditions while negative affect increased. These
results are also consistent with a broader literature focused
on changes in well-being related to advancing age. These
studies show that disease is a significant predictor of age-
related declines in well-being (Mroczek & Spiro, 2005;
Scheibe & Carstensen, 2010; Strawbridge et al., 2002). In
contrast, positive affect was not significantly related to
number of chronic conditions, although the association was
in the expected direction. This observation differs from ear-
lier reports of declines in positive affect associated with
greater disease burden (Kunzmann et al., 2000). Finally,
neither purpose in life nor positive relations with others was
significantly associated with the number of chronic condi-
tions. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel finding,
and it suggests that eudaimonic well-being, which reflects

investment in life goals and personal relationships, may be
relatively insensitive to the number of chronic conditions in
older adults, at least as assessed in this study. It is worth
noting that the effect sizes for the interaction terms were
small--the interaction of purpose in life and chronic condi-
tions explained 1% of the variance in IL-6 and 2% of the
variance in CRP (effect sizes were smaller for positive rela-
tions with others and positive affect)--but with one
exception: the increments in the variance explained were
statistically significant. By comparison, even chronic condi-
tions explained only 4% of the variance in IL-6 and 2% of
the variance in CRP, a reflection of the fact that inflamma-
tion is determined by myriad factors, any one of which is
likely to have a relatively small effect.
Despite declines in some aspects of subjective well-being
with increasing number of chronic conditions, mean levels
of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being were high. This
result is consistent with research suggesting that aging
adults become particularly adept at using cognitive and
behavioral strategies to manage positive psychological
functioning (Scheibe & Carstensen, 2010). Indeed, scores
on some measures of subjective well-being--positive rela-
tions with others, positive affect, and life satisfaction--were
positively associated with age, whereas depressive symptom
scores were associated negatively; scores on the purpose-in-
life scale were quadratically associated with age, rising into
later life before falling among the oldest participants (those
in their late 70s and early 80s). The present results thus sug-
gest that although physical health is an important determi-
nant of some aspects of well-being in later life (Kunzmann
et al., 2000; Mroczek & Spiro, 2005; Strawbridge et al.,
2002), multiple medical comorbidities are not obstacles to
positive psychological functioning.
The final aim of this study was to determine whether
these high levels of subjective well-being would be associ-
ated with favorable profiles of disease risk in the form
of lower circulating levels of inflammatory proteins. The
results showed that at similar numbers of chronic condi-
tions, those with higher levels of positive affect, purpose in
life, and positive relations with others had lower levels of
inflammation. These associations were largely preserved
after adjustments for multiple potential confounds. Further
analytic refinements suggested that hedonic and eudaimonic
well-being make unique contributions to lower levels of
inflammation in older adults with multiple chronic conditions.
The findings extend our earlier research showing that
higher ratings of purpose in life and positive relations with
others predicted lower levels of inflammatory proteins in a
community sample of older women (Friedman et al., 2007)
and that multiple aspects of well-being moderate the asso-
ciation of educational attainment and IL-6 (Morozink,
Friedman, Ryff, & Coe, 2010). Here, we document that
aspects of well-being also moderate the linkage between
later-life chronic conditions and inflammatory markers.
Collectively, such findings underscore the role of positive
psychological functioning in offsetting the extent to which
various life challenges (social inequalities, unfolding health
problems) contribute to biological processes (inflammation)
implicated in future profiles of morbidity and mortality.
That is, higher levels of inflammation are linked to adverse
health outcomes in a range of age-related chronic disease
conditions. CRP in particular has been positively linked
to poorer prognosis in adults with cardiovascular disease
(Blake & Ridker, 2003) and some forms of cancer (Aggarwal
& Gehlot, 2009). Other studies have shown that higher
levels of inflammation predict increased risk for morbidity
and mortality in healthy individuals, particularly in elderly
adults (Harris et al., 1999; Stork et al., 2006). Factors that
moderate levels of inflammation in aging individuals thus
emerge as important influences on health and longevity.
Higher levels of purpose in life (Boyle et al., 2009) and pos-
itive affect (Chida & Steptoe, 2008; Pressman & Cohen,
2005; Steptoe et al., 2009) have been linked to better health
and reduced mortality across the life span, but the mecha-
nisms underlying such associations are unclear. The current
results suggest that reduced inflammation may contribute to
these general associations between well-being and health.
Our results contribute to the broader discussion of what
constitutes successful aging. One of the most influential
definitions of successful aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1998) con-
sists of three elements: absence of physical illness or dis-
ability, high levels of cognitive function and physical
functioning, and active engagement with life. However,
only a small percentage of aging individuals in the United
States would be considered successful agers by these crite-
ria (McLaughlin, Connell, Heeringa, Li, & Roberts, 2010;
Strawbridge et al., 2002), in part because having multiple
medical conditions is increasingly the norm for older adults
(Anderson, 2007). Moreover, many older adults who do not
meet Rowe and Kahn standards consider themselves to be
aging successfully. We believe that a compelling alternative
formulation of successful aging is the ability to remain
actively engaged even in the face of age-related disease
(Young, Frick, & Phelan, 2009).As the current results show,
even high levels of medical comorbidities do not preclude
high levels of subjective well-being. More importantly,
maintaining high levels of well-being into later life, partic-
ularly a sense of life purpose and strong social relationships,
predicts lower levels of inflammatory proteins that them-
selves predict better health outcomes in the context of
chronic illness.
Interpretation of these results should be tempered by
several limitations of the study, the most important being
that the analyses were cross-sectional, and thus, causal rela-
tionships among the variables of interest are unclear. For
example, the ability of inflammatory proteins such as IL-6
to influence mood, particularly depression, is well docu-
mented (Raison, Capuron, & Miller, 2006). The results are
also limited to a single measurement of inflammatory
proteins, which, given variability in their levels within
542 FRIEDMAN AND RYFF
MEDICAL COMORBIDITY, WELL-BEING, AND INFLAMMATION 9
individuals, might produce inaccurate estimates of each
person's circulating levels. Nevertheless, such variability
would be expected to reduce the likelihood of detecting
associations, meaning that the strength of the relationships
observed may be underestimated. Finally, given the small
effect sizes, it is important not to overstate the significance
of these results. The effect sizes for the interactions of
chronic conditions and well-being measures were, however,
comparable with those for chronic conditions and inflam-
mation alone, suggesting that this interaction is not a trivial
one.
In sum, these results add to a growing literature on the
potential salutary effects of positive psychological func-
tioning, and they suggest that among those most at risk for
age-related morbidity and mortality, experiences of positive
affect, purposeful life engagement, and robust social ties
may contribute to better health outcomes.
