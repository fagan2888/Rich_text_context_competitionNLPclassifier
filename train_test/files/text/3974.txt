eHealth interventions have targeted concerns such as physi-
cal activity and behavior change (G. J. Norman et al., 2007);
asthma management in low-income families (Wise et al.,
2009); and self-management for adjustment after curative
breast cancer (van den Berg, Gielissen, Ottevanger, & Prins,
2012). It is crucial for individuals to develop eHealth literacy
skills to better understand, evaluate, and use the health-
related information that is disseminated online (Jensen,
King, Davis, & Guntzviller, 2010; Sarkar et al., 2010).
eHealth literacy (C. D. Norman & Skinner, 2006) has a reli-
able and consistent measure known as eHEALS that, in
recent research, has shown promise as a tool for assessment
in using information technology for health purposes (e.g.,
van der Vaart et al., 2011).
eHealth literacy skills are especially important to develop
in young adults because these skills will inform their deci-
sion-making processes later in life. Linking electronic health
information seeking behaviors to need for cognition (NFC)
is important to see if there are differences among young
adults who are less vested in cognitive thought as opposed to
those who are. This investigation can give insight as to how
young adults are developing their health-related decision-
making skills along with their NFC, two processes that will
carry them through their adult life. Research has examined
the use of the electronic health literacy scale (eHEALS, C. D.
Norman & Skinner, 2006), but studies have yet to connect
health literacy to NFC, particularly in the young adult
population.
A growing body of research in the leading journals on
health communication has cited a critical need to conduct
research on how health literacy skills in young adults influ-
ence health information-seeking behaviors, particularly
through the use of new Internet technologies (Benjamin,
2010; Berkman, Davis, & McCormack, 2010; Dutta-
Bergman, 2005; Eng, 2002; Manganello & Clayman, 2011;
Paek & Hove, 2012). As such, this study aims to address how
health literacy impacts young adults' information-seeking
behavior on the internet. This study is also interested in
examining a possible relationship between higher levels of
eHealth literacy and young adults' engagement in healthy
behaviors, such as engaging in physical activity.
In the present study, eHEALS is connected to NFC and
online health information seeking behavior. Furthermore, we
propose that eHEALS items could be measuring health
self-efficacy rather than literacy, thus building off prior work

Need for Cognition and Electronic Health
Literacy and Subsequent Information
Seeking Behaviors Among University
Undergraduate Students
Rebecca K. Britt1 and Kristen Nicole Hatten2
Abstract
eHealth literacy (eHEALS) has yet to be examined with regard to need for cognition (NFC), as well as whether NFC moderates
the relationship between eHealth literacy and seeking out online health information. Past research that has examined NFC
as an interaction between whether interactivity on health web sites affected comprehension and attitudes, but no research
to date has examined whether cognitive need interacts with eHEALS and subsequent information seeking behaviors. The
present study tests eHEALS and its connection to need for cognition (NFC) in the role of online health information seeking
behaviors. Results showed that high eHEALS individuals were more likely to seek out online health information and were
more likely to have higher NFC scores. NFC did not emerge as a moderator on the relationship between eHealth literacy
and online health information seeking behaviors. Future directions are discussed, in particular, examining eHEALS as a
construct of efficacy and further need to examine eHEALS with need for cognition in health communication research.

suggesting eHEALS is not necessarily a reliable measure of
health literacy (Jordan, Osborne, & Buchbinder, 2011).
Traditional literacy measurements tend to include items that
test proficiency (National Center for Education Statistics,
2012), rather than items about perceived ability, which are
traditionally items that belong in the domain of social cogni-
tive theory (Bandura, 1986). eHEALS has not been exam-
ined with regard to NFC, nor has the role of NFC as a
moderator of the relationship between health information
seeking and eHEALS. Past research that has examined NFC
as an interaction between whether interactivity on health
websites affected comprehension and attitudes (Lustria,
2007), but no research to date has examined whether NFC
interacts with eHEALS and subsequent information seeking
behaviors. Thus, this study aims to contribute to the growing
body of literature on eHealth literacy and information seek-
ing behaviors by (a) examining the relationship between
cognitive need and use of seeking out health information
online; (b) the role of eHealth literacy, seeking out informa-
tion online, and whether cognitive need plays a role in that
behavior; and (c) the connection between levels of eHealth
literacy and enactment of healthy behaviors.
eHealth Literacy
Health literacy is, as defined in the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 report,
"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain,
process, and understand basic health information and ser-
vices needed to make appropriate health decisions" (Location
12). Health literacy goes beyond basic reading ability. It
includes the ability to understand instructions on drug usage,
appointment cards and brochures, and directions, as well as
the ability to navigate complicated health care systems. The
eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS), though, provides a mea-
sure of an individual's self-perceived skill and self-efficacy
in using information technology for health purposes (C. D.
Norman & Skinner, 2006). eHEALS has been tested in inter-
vention trials and population surveys in multicultural sam-
ples with strong internal consistency and reliability.
The National Institutes of Health (2012) has current
efforts dedicated to continuing to develop and improve
health literacy. The U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (2012) has compiled recommendations for develop-
ers and practitioners to develop easy to use health web sites
that put action behaviors first and engage people.
The Elaboration Likelihood Model and
Need for Cognition
Need for cognition (NFC) is one of the most studied indi-
vidual factors in message processing and persuasion
(Cacioppo, Petty, & Kao, 1984). The Elaboration
Likelihood Model (ELM; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) and
Heuristic Systematic Model (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly,
1989) designate NFC as a way to assess individual differ-
ences in cognitive effort. ELM is a model that focuses on
how attitudes develop and change over time, and desig-
nates NFC as the central factor that influences cognitive
involvement. Based on the role of persuasion and message
processing, people high in NFC tend to enjoy thinking
without external influences and tend to more closely scru-
tinize communication in addition to processing informa-
tion more actively and more in-depth (Chang & McDaniel,
1995; Verplanken, Hazenberg, & Palenewen, 1992). Most
importantly, though, individuals high in NFC are more
intrinsically motivated to think as opposed to those who
are low in NFC (Haugtvedt & Petty, 1992). Similarly, high
NFC individuals tend to engage in online activity that
requires more cognitive effort (Tuten & Bosnjak, 2001).
Recommendations on examining health literacy have sug-
gested that a key connection is the individual's need to
engage in cognitive thought (Safeer & Keenan, 2005) and
that the NFC scale can lend important insight.
Research on cognitive involvement, or the degree to
which an individual is intensely involved in some stimulus,
has largely been examined using theoretical frameworks
such as the Elaboration Likelihood Model (e.g., Petty &
Cacioppo, 1986), which examine the role of one's level of
cognitive involvement when presented with stimuli. The
need for cognition (NFC) is a variable that examines the
extent to which one is involved with some stimuli that
requires some cognitive output. For example, relatively
recent research has explored NFC in terms of listening style
preference and the relationship between high and low cogni-
tion (Worthington, 2008), the interaction of NFC and mes-
sagetypeonpositivehealthencouragement(Williams-Piehota
et al., 2006), and understanding the dimensions of perceived
interactivity in social interactions (Sohn & Lee, 2005). What
is still missing from the literature is an exploration as to how
NFC relates to eHealth literacy, particularly in the young
adult population.
Need for Cognition as a Moderator
in eHEALS and Health Information
Seeking Behavior
Research using the NFC scale has explored how others'
reactions to news presented on the Internet affects individ-
ual perceptions of public opinions and as a result, their per-
sonal opinion (Lee & Jang, 2010). NFC was used as a
moderator on the effects of approval rating and individual
comments. High NFC individuals were more reliant on
approval ratings, but low NFC individuals remained unal-
tered. Other research looked at the effectiveness of testimo-
nials compared with informational health messages in
regard to personal involvement (Braverman, 2008). There
remains a need, however, to look at whether NFC is a factor
in one's use of the Internet to seek out information about
health issues. New measures, such as the electronic health
Britt and Hatten 3
literacy scale (eHEALS; C. D. Norman & Skinner, 2006),
have emerged as a response to the growing need for examin-
ing electronic health literacy. But, as the authors earlier sug-
gest, items in eHEALS tend to reflect efficacious beliefs
(i.e., "I know how to use the Internet to answer my health
questions," "I have the skills I need to evaluate the health
resources I find on the Internet"), rather than literacy-based
items. In any case, eHEALS has been found to be a tight fit-
ting scale with high correlational values and a strong body
of support (Knapp, Madden, Wang, Sloyer, & Shenkman,
2011; van der Vaart et al., 2011), and is being adapted in
multiple languages (e.g., Koo, Norman, & Chang, 2012;
Mitsutake, Shibata, Ishii, Okazaki, & Oka, 2011).
Researchers have used NFC as an interaction term with
other constructs. Individual attitudes such as trust in media
sources may interact with gratifications sought when people
shape their media usage (Tsfati & Cappella, 2005). Some
research has investigated the interactive effects of NFC; for
instance, Priester and Petty (1995) examined source credibil-
ity and its interaction with NFC on persuasion and message
processing. They found that message processing of low NFC
individuals tended to be influenced by source credibility,
whereas high NFC individuals tended to be less influenced
by source credibility. Here, NFC interacted with source trust-
worthiness, providing an early rationale for NFC as an inter-
action term. More recently, Tsfati and Cappella (2005)
examined the role of NFC as interacting with media skepti-
cism and the joint effect on media exposure. NFC signifi-
cantly interacted with media skepticism in the effect on
mainstream news exposure--which Tsfati and Cappella
argue that, as NFC goes up, the connection between news
skepticism and news exposure disappears, thus supporting
NFC as a moderator.
With regard to online information seeking behaviors,
Lustria (2007) conducted an experiment to examine the
effects of web interactivity on comprehension and attitudes
toward health websites and whether individual differences
moderated the effects. In that research, two websites on skin
cancer were created by the researcher and evaluated by par-
ticipants. Lustria found that whether or not the website had
interactive information affected comprehension and atti-
tudes, and predicted that high NFC individuals would have a
higher comprehension score of website information com-
pared with low NFC individuals. This is compelling because
it suggests that high NFC individuals are more likely to
engage in effortful information-seeking behaviors, and fur-
thermore, that they understand more than those who do not
enjoy thinking as much; importantly, comprehension is a
critical facet of eHealth literacy.
Those higher in NFC may be more willing to invest time
into satisfying that cognitive need, such as exposing them-
selves to new information, resulting in a decrease in selective
exposure of media sources (Tsfati & Cappella, 2005). When
NFC is high, the likeliness to have a cognitive need to seek
out health information could also be high. On the other hand,
when NFC is low, people may be less likely to seek out infor-
mation online if they do not have a reason.
Research Design
To increase generalizability in the findings, this study used a
survey design with university undergraduate students.Asurvey
design (Alreck & Settle, 2004) allowed the researchers to
directly ask participants questions about their use of the Internet
for health purposes, the critical issues recommended by the
CDC for college students, and answered the NFC and eHEALS
scales. The present manuscript addresses the following ques-
tions: First, does need for cognition have a relationship with
whether an individual has sought out health information online,
and second, does it predict future intent to seek out health infor-
mation online? With new measures like eHEALS, is there
some relationship between level of cognitive exertion and this
scale? The following research questions are offered:
Research Question 1: Will high NFC individuals will be
more likely to have sought out health information
online than low NFC individuals?
Research Question 1a: Will high eHEALS individuals
will be more likely to have sought out health informa-
tion online than low eHEALS individuals?
Research Question 2: Will individuals who score high
on the NFC scale will also be high in self-efficacy,
according to the eHEALS scale?
Research Question 3: Will NFC moderate the relation-
ship between health literacy/efficacy (eHEALS) and
health information seeking behavior?
Finally, in an attempt to contextualize the contribution of
NFC and eHEALS, we sought out the relationship between
eHealth literacy and healthy behaviors in the areas identified
as key by the Centers for Disease Control: substance abuse,
sleep, vaccination, sexual health, diet, and mental health. As
such, the final research question asks,
Research Question 4: Does eHealth literacy contribute
to healthy behavior?
Method
On IRB approval, data were collected in 2012 over a period
of 3 months at a large Midwestern University in the United
States. An online survey was distributed in a computer lab to
university students. The survey was created to assess stu-
dents'use of the Internet to address health concerns or issues.
The survey included the eHEALS scale (C. D. Norman &
Skinner, 2006) and the abbreviated version of the Need for
Cognition scale (Cacioppo et al., 1984).
A description of the survey is below, and the appendix
contains the full survey.

Study Tool: Survey Measures
In the survey, participants first answered a series of demo-
graphic questions, followed by a question that asked whether
they have a health condition that requires regular interaction
with a physician. Participants were not asked to elaborate on
this answer. The majority of participants did not report a con-
dition (90.60%), but some did (9.4%; missing values = 3).
After this, participants answered the eHEALS scale. Then,
they completed four questions relating to how they maintain
their general health, followed by blocks of four questions in
each of the following areas: exercise, substance abuse, sleep,
vaccination, sexual health, diet, and mental health. These
health areas were selected because they were listed as the
American College Health Association's (2012) recommen-
dations based on extensive research as the key issues affect-
ing undergraduate students. Finally, participants responded
to the NFC scale (unchanged). On completion of those ques-
tions, participants had completed the survey and were
thanked for their time. The survey instrument is included as
an appendix.
eHEALS
The eHEALS scale1 is an 8-item measure of electronic health
literacy ( = .93) to measure users' knowledge, comfort and
skills at finding, evaluating and using electronic health infor-
mation (C. D. Norman & Skinner, 2006). Descriptives for
eHEALS showed that M = 29.41, SD = 5.53. The eHEALS
scale was developed to potentially serve as a way to identify
people who may or may not benefit from referrals to an elec-
tronic health intervention. However, given the questions of
the eHEALS scale, it can be argued that eHEALS is a better
measure of electronic health self-efficacy. In the present
manuscript, study results point toward eHEALS as related to
self-efficacy, rather than as a pure measure of literacy.
Need for Cognition
The Need for Cognition scale ( = .81; NFC) refers to the
tendency to engage in cognitive efforts and to enjoy such
efforts. The initial NFC included 34 items, and two proce-
dures resulted in decreasing the number of items in the scale
to 18 (r = .95, p < .001; Cacioppo et al., 1984). All appropri-
ate items that denoted ** were reverse coded. The descrip-
tives for the summed NFC scale were M = 52.48, SD = 8.5.
Results
Atotal of 420 participants took the survey, ranging in ages 18
to 35 (M = 20.48, SD = 2.14), and all participants were under-
graduate students (M = 2.76, SD = 1.15). Participants pre-
dominantly reported Caucasian/White as their ethnicity
(78.6%), with some Asian/Pacific Islander (11.4%), African
American (3.8%), Hispanic/Latino (3.3%), Other (2.6%),
and four missing values.
Research Question 1 asked, "Will high NFC individuals
will be more likely to have sought out health information
online than low NFC individuals?" We ran a linear regres-
sion using the control variables of gender and age and the
question "I have used Internet resources to help me under-
stand or manage my health needs this semester" as the
dependent variable and need for cognition scale as the pre-
dictor. The results of this regression are given in Table 1. No
relationship was found between these variables (r = .036, p <
.501). A second model regressed NFC onto intent to seek out
health information (as opposed to past behavior), and again,
no relationship was found (r = .005, p < .932). Research
Question 1 was not supported.
Research Question 1a asked "Will high eHEALS indi-
viduals will be more likely to have sought out health infor-
mation online than low eHEALS individuals?" Research
Question 1a regressed the eHEALS score with "I have used
Internet resources to help me understand or manage my
health needs this semester." A significant relationship was
found (r = .275, p < .0001). Research Question 1a was sup-
ported, albeit with a small relationship (see Table 2 for the
regression model).
Research Question 2 asked "Will individuals who score
high on the NFC scale will also be high in self-efficacy,
according to the eHEALS scale?" For Research Question 2,
a linear regression was run with the question "I have used
Internet resources to help me understand or manage my
health needs this semester" as the dependent variable and the
eHEALS score as the predictor (see Table 3). When the NFC
score was entered into a regression model with eHEALS
score as the dependent variable, a positive relationship was
found (r = .179, p = .001). There was a small but significant
relationship that at least suggests that individuals high in
NFC may also be high in Internet health self-efficacy, accord-
ing to eHEALS.
Finally, Research Question 3 suggested that as NFC
increases, the relationship between health self-efficacy and

health information seeking behavior becomes stronger. For
Research Question 3, an interaction term was created
(eHEALS × NFC). A linear regression showed that the inter-
action between eHEALS and NFC was not a significant pre-
dictor of health information seeking behavior (p = .792).
Thus, Research Question 3 was not supported.
Research Question 4 asked, "Does eHealth literacy con-
tribute to healthy behaviors?" in the areas identified by the
CDC as crucial for college students, including substance
abuse, sleep, vaccination, sexual health, diet, and mental
health. To answer this question, a composite term Healthiness
was created by taking the mean of each of the areas of sub-
stance abuse, sleep, vaccination, sexual health, diet, and
mental health. The mean of Healthiness was M = 3.66, SD =
0.53. For R1, a linear regression was run with eHEALS as
the dependent variable and the predictors Age, Gender, and
Healthiness composite. With all components in the model, a
positive relationship was found (r = .201, p = .001). Table 4
shows the full model. Indeed, when looking at the full model,
after controlling for Age and Gender, Healthiness contrib-
uted 21.3% of the variance in the model, and was significant
at p = .0001. Based on these results, we have evidence that
suggests that eHealth literacy may contribute to healthy
behaviors. However, because this was a preliminary ques-
tion, we recommend further studies examine the relationship
with these constructs in much greater depth.
Discussion
The first research question asked if high NFC individuals
would have been more likely to seek out health information
online than those who do not. Although support for this
research question was not found, demographic factors should
be considered. It may be that this particular population have
not been as active, given that they are a younger demographic
and may not have had as many experiences to necessitate
time spent seeking out this health information. A recent
report from the Pew Internet and American Life Project
(2010) found that the "millennial" generation--today's teens
and young adults in their twenties--are split among their
health information seeking online. According to that report,
31% of ages 12-17 receive health or physical fitness infor-
mation on the Internet, but groups above the age of 17 are
more likely to begin to use the Internet for health informa-
tion. In fact, according to the Pew Internet and American
Life Project, 72% of adults aged 18-29 look for health infor-
mation online, although it is unclear how that breakdown
occurs in that age range. Given that the average age of par-
ticipants in the current study is 20.48, it may be that at this
point in their lives, it is simply too soon to tell whether such
a difference exists. It may also be that as a college demo-
graphic, health issues may not have been as salient for this
population. Finally, this population may not have been the
most generalizable group because participants were under-
graduates. At the same time, it is curious that high scoring
eHEALS individuals were more likely to have sought out
health information online. It may be that there is a greater
connection with health self-efficacy and health information
than there is with whether one is high or low in their need for
cognition. As such, there remains a need to test eHEALS and
health information seeking behaviors with other populations,
including young adults.
Although Research Question 1 did not find a relationship
between high NFC individuals and health information seek-
ing behaviors, support for Research Question 1a suggests
that individuals who are higher in eHEALS are more likely
to seek out health information online. This is consistent with
other research that has found a positive relationship between
literacy skills and seeking out information (Kinengyere,
2007; Paek & Hove, 2012). As eHEALS items are focused
on perceived ability to use Internet resources, this makes
sense. Findings from Research Question 1a suggest a need to
examine the role of health self-efficacy and information
seeking behaviors among different demographics. It also

suggests the role of enhancing self-efficacy in online health
interventions, as individuals with higher self-efficacy are
more likely to seek out information on particular health
issues. Similarly, the relationship between eHEALS and high
NFC scores (Research Question 2) was found to be signifi-
cant, which makes sense, given that both measures attempt to
better understand individual characteristics in cognitive need
and perceived capability.
When examining the role of NFC as a moderator between
eHEALS and health information seeking behaviors, no rela-
tionship exists. While NFC was positively related to eHEALS
and information seeking, it could be that it serves more of a
predictive, rather than moderating role. Recent research
examining the role of NFC as either a predictor or moderator
in a smoking intervention found NFC did not moderate the
role of a tailored intervention on actual smoking abstinence
(Haug et al., 2010).
Results for Research Question 4 indicated that high levels
of eHealth literacy do contribute to individuals engaging in
healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity), a finding sup-
ported by earlier work (Neuhauser & Kreps, 2010). This
relationship could be causal in either direction: Individuals
who have high eHealth literacy, by definition, are more able
to understand healthy behaviors and their benefits, and thus
engage in these behaviors more frequently. On the other
hand, individuals who frequently participate in healthy
behaviors might have the vocabulary, experiences, and moti-
vation to help them discover and better understand health
information online. Further work in this area can more
closely evaluate this relationship.
Conclusion
This study examined the role of a relatively new but vali-
dated measure (eHEALS) that seems to be a relatively valid
predictor of whether an individual has the capacity to engage
with eHealth information sources. There are several limita-
tions in the study, however. Firstly, while young adults were
selected purposefully for the present study, various demo-
graphics should be examined in future research. This type of
research should study mothers and fathers of young adults in
college and compare their use of the Internet for health-infor-
mation seeking behaviors, in addition to exploring how they
themselves understand eHealth. Elderly adults should also be
examined in terms of their ability to use the Internet for
health information, whether they are successful in finding
what they look for, and what their recommendations are for
improvement, which would be helpful in understanding web
usability as well.
In addition, while this research suggests that eHEALS
could be a potentially better measure of efficacy rather than
literacy, it did not directly study the role of self-efficacy on
electronic health information seeking behaviors. Future
research should seek to study the eHEALS measure more
closely with traditional efficacy research.
This study had mixed results with regard to the role of
NFC and eHEALS. The results from this study point toward
a need to develop intervention materials when conducting
eHEALS research and more closely examine how NFC oper-
ates within that frame. For instance, a prime way to develop
an intervention would be one on making decisions about get-
ting the HPV vaccine. That would include providing priming
materials, which could be in print or another media, and con-
tain statements that are gain or loss framed with regard to
getting the vaccine (Rothman, Martino, Bedell, Detweiler, &
Salovey, 1999). Gain-framed messages seem to positively
influence preventive health behavior (Witting, Boere-
Boonekamp, Fleuren, Sakkers, & Ijzerman, 2012). The way
an individual high in NFC interprets those types of messages
could lend critical insight into the factors that contribute
toward getting the vaccine--and even more so on a theoreti-
cal level.
Multiple avenues for further research exist based on these
results. A replication of the study with a broad demographic
may give information as to whether demographics were a
factor with the lack of support for NFC. It may also be that
highly cognitive individuals may be more motivated to seek
out health information online, but that NFC simply is not the
best measure to capture that information. Further research
should continue to assess, quantitatively and qualitatively,
the need for cognition, along with emerging measures on
health literacy and self-efficacy, to better understand such
behaviors.
Finally, need for cognition states that high cognitive
misers are more likely to engage in thought-provoking acts,
whereas low cognitive misers are less likely to think in-
depth. The theory behind eHEALS (Norman & Skinner,
2007) is that it purports that electronic health literacy com-
prises assessing comfort and skill in using information tech-
nology for health. For instance, in a clinical environment,

eHEALS can potentially serve as a way to identify those who
may or may not benefit from eHealth resources and interven-
tions. But to better assess this outcome, eHEALS should be
connected to need for cognition because its items focus on
patient efficacy, rather than traditional literacy skills. Indeed,
to a lesser extent, eHEALS is a tool for usability testing of a
given health web site or technical interface based on the self-
efficacy of a patient. Considering the need for high or low
thought should be included in this framework because it can
directly affect the way users interact with a health web site
based on its messages, images, and multimedia content.
Interventions that subsequently connect eHEALS to cogni-
tive thought not only makes it more valuable from a usability
perspective, but for better assessing the user.
The implicit connection between eHEALS and NFC
has implications for future interventions on eHealth in
terms of literacy, efficacy, and message strategy. Indeed,
NFC has shown to moderate the processing of health
information (Williams-Piehota, Schneider, Pizarro,
Mowad, & Salovey, 2003), because the meaning behind
that information is processed in different ways. For
instance, findings from Williams-Piehota et al. (2003)
show that messages tailored to high or low NFC individu-
als tended to be better at persuading mammography
screening. With the increasing growth in Web 2.0 strate-
gies that encourage tailored, individual messages, it makes
sense that eHEALS should be administered with NFC in
research and intervention strategies.

Need for cognition
 I would prefer complex to simple problems.
 I like to have the responsibility of handling a situation that requires a lot of thinking.
 Thinking is not my idea of fun.
 I would rather do something that requires little thought than something that is sure to challenge my thinking abilities.
 I try to anticipate and avoid situations where there is likely a chance I will have to think in depth about something.
 I find satisfaction in deliberating hard and for long hours.
 I only think as hard as I have to.
 I prefer to think about small, daily projects to long-term ones.
 I like tasks that require little thought once I've learned them.
 The idea of relying on thought to make my way to the top appeals to me.
 I really enjoy a task that involves coming up with new solutions to problems.
 Learning new ways to think doesn't excite me very much.
 I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve.
 The notion of thinking abstractly is appealing to me.
 I would prefer a task that is intellectual, difficult, and important to one that is somewhat important but does not require much
thought.
 I feel relief rather than satisfaction after completing a task that required a lot of mental effort.
 It's enough for me that something gets the job done; I don't care how or why it works.
 I usually end up deliberating about issues even when they do not affect me personally.
