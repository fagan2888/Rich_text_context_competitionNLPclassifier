Background Differences between socioeconomic groups in
mortality from and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases
have been reported in many countries. We have made a
comparative analysis of these inequalities in the United
States and 11 western European countries. The aims of the
analysis were (1) to compare the size of inequalities in
cardiovascular disease mortality between countries, and (2)
to explore the possible contribution of cardiovascular risk
factors to the explanation of between-country differences in
inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality.
Data and Methods Data on ischaemic heart disease,
cerebrovascular disease and total cardiovascular disease
mortality by occupational class and/or educational level
were obtained from national longitudinal or unlinked cross-
sectional studies. Data on smoking, alcohol consumption,
overweight and infrequent consumption of fresh vegetables
by occupational class and/or educational level were
obtained from national health interview or multipurpose
surveys and from the European Union's Eurobarometer
survey. Age-adjusted rate ratios for mortality were corre-
lated with age-adjusted odds ratios for the behavioural
risk factors.
Results In all countries mortality from cardiovascular
diseases is higher among persons with lower occupational
class or lower educational level. Within western Europe, a
north­south gradient is apparent, with relative and
absolute inequalities being larger in the north than in the
south. For ischaemic heart disease, but not for cerebro-
vascular disease, an even more striking north­south gradi-
ent is seen, with some `reverse' inequalities in southern
Europe. The United States occupy intermediate positions
on most indicators. Inequalities in cardiovascular disease
mortality are associated with inequalities in some risk
factors, especially cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol
consumption.
Conclusions Socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular
disease mortality are a major public health problem in most
industrialized countries. Closing the gap between low and
high socioeconomic groups offers great potential for reduc-
ing cardiovascular disease mortality. Developing effective
methods of behavioural risk factor reduction in the
lower socioeconomic groups should be a top priority in
cardiovascular disease prevention.

Introduction
It is well-known that in many industrialized countries
cardiovascular disease mortality is higher among those
of lower than higher socioeconomic status, as indicated
by educational level, occupational class or income
level[1,2]. If the higher cardiovascular mortality rates in
the lower socioeconomic groups could be reduced the
average rates of cardiovascular disease mortality in these
countries could similarly be lowered.
In order to achieve these reductions, however, the
causes of the inequalities must be known. The available
evidence on the explanation of inequalities in cardio-
vascular disease mortality is limited, and mainly comes

from epidemiological studies on ischaemic heart disease
mortality among selected populations within the United
Kingdom, the Nordic countries or the U.S.A.[3­6]. A
general finding is that only part of the socioeconomic
gradient in ischaemic heart disease mortality can be
explained by a higher prevalence of classical risk factors
like smoking, serum cholesterol and hypertension[3­6].
We report on a study which followed a different
approach: we quantified the magnitude of inequalities in
cardiovascular disease mortality in a number of indus-
trialized countries, and then looked to see whether
between-country differences in the magnitude of risk-
factor inequalities matches that of cardiovascular dis-
ease mortality. This approach takes advantage of the
large variation between countries in the epidemiology
and social patterning of cardiovascular disease and its
risk factors.
The aims of this study were: to quantify socioeco-
nomic inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality in
a large number of industrialized countries; to determine
the association between inequalities in cardiovascular
disease mortality and inequalities in risk factors in these
countries.
This study covers men and women aged 30­59 in the
United States and 11 countries in western Europe. Both
total cardiovascular disease mortality and mortality
from its main components, ischaemic heart disease and
cerebrovascular disease, were studied. Risk factors
which were included in the analysis are cigarette smok-
ing, alcohol consumption, overweight and lack of fresh
vegetables.
Data and methods
Mortality data
An overview of data sources for mortality can be found
in Table 1. For the United States we obtained data from
the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, which in-
volves a 10-year follow-up of 0·5% of the population[7].
For 6 out of 11 countries in western Europe (the Nordic
countries, England/Wales and Italy) we also obtained
data from longitudinal studies, most of which involved a
follow-up of the complete national population enumer-
ated at the census. The exceptions are England and
Wales, where a 1% sample of the national population
was followed-up[8], and Italy where the available study
covers the population of the city of Turin only[9]. For the
other five countries in western Europe data were ob-
tained from cross-sectional studies. In these studies,
mortality is classified according to socioeconomic infor-
mation on the death certificate, and related to the
population present in the same period, classified accord-
ing to socioeconomic information obtained during the
census. Broadly speaking, the longitudinal mortality
data cover the 1980s (with classification by occupation
or education and by age based on the situation around
1980), while the cross-sectional data cover a couple of
years surrounding the beginning of the decade.
For all countries, mortality could be classified by
occupational class, but only for men. In order to avoid
comparability problems, a common occupational class
scheme, the Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero (EGP)
scheme[10], was applied to as many countries as possible.
EGP conversion algorithms[10,11] were applied to
individual-level data on occupational title (by 3-digit
code), employment status and supervisory status. These
conversion schemes could not be applied to the data
available for Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain and
Portugal. Data from these countries, classified on the
basis of national schemes, could, however, be made
comparable to the EGP scheme at the level of three
broad classes: non-manual occupations, manual occu-
pations, and farmers/farm labourers[12]. We will report
on the rate ratio of mortality among men in manual as
compared to men in non-manual occupations.
In most countries, there was insufficient information
on the former occupation of economically inactive men
(retired, disabled, unemployed, etc.), who would there-
fore have been excluded from the analysis. This exclu-
sion is likely to lead to an under-estimation of mortality
differences between occupational classes[13,14]. We there-
fore applied a procedure which corrects for this under-
estimation, and which is based on the population share
and the relative mortality level of economically inactive
men. This adjustment was made for cardiovascular
diseases separately. Further details on this procedure,
as well on tests of its performance, can be found
elsewhere[12,15].
For some of the countries in this study, mortality
could also be classified by level of education. In contrast
to occupational class, level of education could be used in
an internationally comparable way for the classification
of women. Educational level was measured as the
highest level of education which the subject had com-
pleted. OECD guidelines were used to reclassify the
original educational categories into a common

scheme[16]. In different countries, different degrees of
detail in educational classification could be achieved. We
will report on the rate ratio of mortality of men and
women with lower secondary, primary or no completed
education, as compared to men and women with upper
secondary or tertiary education.
Cardiovascular disease mortality was defined as mor-
tality from underlying causes coded 390-459, according
to the ninth revision of the International Classification
of Diseases[17]. The corresponding code-numbers for
ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were
410-414 and 430-438, respectively. Among men, the
proportion of cardiovascular disease mortality which is
accounted for by ischaemic heart disease, ranged from
39% in Portugal to 78% in Norway and Ireland, and
cerebrovascular disease accounted for between 10% in
Norway and Switzerland and 39% in Portugal. Among
women, the proportions of ischaemic heart disease were
smaller and those of cerebrovascular disease larger than
among men, but the international pattern of these
proportions was the same.
Rate ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were
calculated on the basis of Poisson regression analysis.
The regression models included age as a nominal vari-
able (5-year age-groups). In the case of the U.S.A.,
regression models also included ethnicity (Hispanic/
other white/black/all other), because we consider eth-
nicity to be a potential confounder of the relationship
between socioeconomic variables and mortality. Ethnic-
ity is associated with, and causally antecedent to, edu-
cational achievement, and is also an independent risk
factor for mortality[18]. In practice, this adjustment had
very little impact on the results.
Although rate ratios are our primary outcome
measure, we will also present data on absolute levels of
cardiovascular disease mortality by occupational class
and educational level. The rate ratios are adequate
measures for analytical purposes, for example for com-
parison with (relative) inequalities in risk factors, but
absolute differences in cardiovascular disease mortality
are more relevant for public health policy.
Risk factor data
Data on risk factors were obtained from two sources:
national health interview or multipurpose surveys (avail-
able for eight western European countries[15] and for the
U.S.A.[19]), and Eurobarometer surveys. The latter is a
multipurpose survey commissioned by the European
Union and executed in a standardized way in all member
states (available for seven western European countries in
our study[20]).
National health interview or multipurpose survey data
were available to quantify inequalities in current ciga-
rette smoking by level of education. The data cover the
period ca. 1987­ca. 1993. In order for the cohorts for
which we have mortality data to correspond, we re-
stricted the analysis to the age-group 40­69. This group
were 30­59 around 1980, and in the absence of strong
secular trends and selection effects, inequalities in risk
factors observed in these cohorts around 1990 are likely
to reflect the differences in exposure within the cohorts
for which we have analysed inequalities in mortality.
Sample sizes in this age-group ranged between ca. 1000
in Denmark and ca. 10 000 in Italy.
Eurobarometer data were available to quantify
inequalities in a wider range of risk factors, both by level
of education and by occupational class. Data were
available for current cigarette smoking, moderate
alcohol consumption (1­4 glasses/day), excessive alcohol
consumption (>4 glasses/day for men, >3 glasses/day
for women), overweight (body mass index >27), and
lack of fresh vegetables (<3 days per week). The data
cover the period 1987­1991 and we restricted the analy-
sis to the age-group 40­69, for the same reasons as
mentioned above. Sample sizes in this age-group were
between ca. 400 (overweight, vegetables) and ca. 1700
(smoking) in all countries.
In the national surveys, the educational measure was
similar to that in the mortality studies, which permitted
us to calculate age-adjusted odds ratios of risk factor
prevalence among men and women with lower second-
ary, primary or no education, as compared to men and
women with upper secondary and tertiary education,
using logistic regression. In the Eurobarometers, the
educational groups which could be compared are those
with 0­11 years of education and those with 12 years of
education or more, classification into manual and non-
manual occupations could also be made. The regression
models included age as a nominal variable (5-year age
groups).
In order to explore the possible contribution of
inequalities in behavioural risk factors to inequalities in
cardiovascular disease mortality, we calculated Pearson
correlation coefficients between the age-adjusted odds
ratios for the risk factors and the age-adjusted rate ratios
for mortality. Because of the limited number of
countries for which educational differences in mortality
could be calculated, we restricted this correlation analy-
sis to the data on inequalities in mortality by occu-
pational class. Although such a comparison is suitable,
we also calculated correlations with inequalities in risk
factors by educational level, because the occupational
data in the Eurobarometer are rather crude and because
the national survey data, which were only available by
educational level, cover a larger number of countries.
Results
Mortality
Table 2 gives an overview of the age-adjusted rates of
cardiovascular disease mortality by occupational class
and educational level observed in this study. In all
countries mortality is higher among persons with lower
occupational class or (in the subset of countries for
which these data are available) lower educational level.
This applies to both men and women.

There is, however, substantial variation between
countries in the magnitude of these differences. This
variation can best be observed for mortality by occu-
pational class among middle-aged men. Absolute differ-
ences are smallest in Portugal and largest in Finland,
due to a combination of low (high) average death
rates and small (large) relative differences in mortality.
Generally speaking, there appears to be a north­south
gradient in western Europe, with average rates, absolute
differences and relative differences being larger in the
north than in the south. The United States occupy an
intermediate position.
Figure 1 illustrates the international variation in rela-
tive differences by occupational class. The north­south
gradient within western Europe for cardiovascular dis-
ease mortality can clearly be discerned, with rate ratios
ranging between 1·55 (95% CI: 1·50­1·61) in Finland
and 1·01 (95% CI: 0·95­1·08) in Portugal. For ischaemic
heart disease an even more striking north­south gradi-
ent is evident. Rate ratios are clearly above 1·00 in the
Nordic countries, in England and Wales and Ireland,
but below 1·00 in Spain and Portugal, indicating that in
the latter countries mortality from ischaemic heart dis-
ease is higher in the higher occupational classes. For
cerebrovascular disease the international pattern is dif-
ferent, with a very high rate ratio in England and Wales
and rate ratios above 1·00 in the south of Europe too.
Less clear international patterns are seen for mortality
among men and women by educational level, for which
data are available in a subset of countries (Figure 2).
However, within western Europe there is a clear contrast
between the three Nordic countries (large inequalities in
cardiovascular disease mortality among both men and
women) and Italy (smaller inequalities). It is also inter-
esting to note that rate ratios are generally higher for
women than for men.
Risk factors
Because of space limitations we have not included
detailed data on inequalities in behavioural risk factors.
Although we found higher prevalences in the lower
socioeconomic groups for most risk factors in most
countries, we also found marked international differ-
ences in these patterns. Men and women in lower
occupational and/or educational groups are more often

aBecause of differences between studies in design (e.g. certain
exclusions, length of follow-up, etc.) these absolute rates could not
be calculated directly from the observed numbers of cardiovascular
deaths in each study. Instead, we used the national mortality rates
from cardiovascular diseases (obtained from the World Health
Organization and standardized to the European Standard Popu-
lation), and multiplied these by the Standardized Mortality Ratios
for high and low socioeconomic groups (calculated with data from
the studies in Table 1).

current cigarette smokers, except in Spain and Portugal
(men) and all southern European countries (women)
where `reverse' patterns were found. Men and women in
lower socioeconomic groups are also less often moderate
alcohol consumers in all countries. Among men,
prevalence rates of excessive alcohol consumption are
generally higher in the lower socioeconomic groups
(differences being largest in England/Wales and Ireland),
but among women no clear differences were found in
any of the countries. Men and women in lower socio-
economic groups are more often overweight in all
countries, with differences being smallest in Ireland,
Spain and Portugal. Finally, men and women in lower
socioeconomic groups less frequently eat fresh veg-
etables, with differences being smallest in Italy, France
and Portugal.
Table 3 presents the correlations between
inequalities in risk factors and inequalities in mortality
among men. The international pattern of inequalities in
cardiovascular disease mortality corresponds closely
with that of inequalities in cigarette smoking and excess-
ive alcohol consumption. This is particularly evident
for inequalities in risk factors by level of education,
where several correlations above 0·80 were found.
Countries with larger inequalities in cigarette smoking
and with larger inequalities in excessive alcohol con-
sumption also have larger inequalities in cardiovascular,
ischaemic and cerebrovascular disease mortality (Fig. 3).
Negative correlations are seen for moderate alcohol
consumption.
Discussion
Summary of findings
We found socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular
disease mortality in all countries included in this study,
thereby confirming many earlier reports covering single
countries[3­6,21­26]. The main contribution of our study is
that we have documented important variations between
countries in the magnitude, and sometimes the direction,
of these inequalities.
For total cardiovascular disease mortality, inequalities
are larger in the Nordic countries and England/Wales
and Ireland, than in the south of Europe. This applies to
both relative and absolute measures of inequalities, and
suggests that the potential benefits of lowering cardio-
vascular disease mortality in the lower socioeconomic
groups are larger in the former than in the latter group of
countries. This international pattern is mainly deter-
mined by ischaemic heart disease mortality, for which
we even found `reverse' gradients in some southern
European countries. There is no north­south gradient
for inequalities in cerebrovascular disease mortality.
The risk factor data suggest that these international
patterns are at least partly due to differences between
countries in the social patterning of health-related
behaviour. It appears that inequalities in cardiovascular
disease mortality are consistently larger in countries
where inequalities in cigarette smoking and in excessive
alcohol consumption are larger.
Evaluation of data problems
Although we have made every effort to increase com-
parability of data between countries, the validity of
our results may be threatened by residual differences
between countries in data collection. We have identified
four potential problem areas: certification and coding
of causes of death; measurement of socioeconomic
inequalities in mortality; reliability of survey data; and
mismatches between the mortality and the risk factor
data.

Despite efforts of the World Health Organization at
standardizing data collection, countries are known to
differ in their procedures and practices of certification
and coding of causes of death, including certification
and coding of cardiovascular disease mortality[27]. It is
possible that rates of cardiovascular disease mortality,
and particularly ischaemic heart disease mortality, are
under-estimated in the south of Europe, because recog-
nition of this disease is less well developed than in the
north. This would affect the comparison of the absolute
rates as presented in Table 2, but not necessarily the
comparison of the rate ratios presented in Fig. 1. What
matters for the validity of the comparison of rate ratios
is whether the degree of under-estimation of cardiovas-
cular disease mortality differs between socioeconomic
groups, and whether this difference is larger in some
countries than in others. There is no direct evidence to
support or refute this possibility, but the fact that the
inequalities in total mortality (without a distinction by
cause of death) are also smaller in the south of
Europe[12,28], suggests that substantial bias is unlikely.
Despite our own efforts at increasing comparability
between countries in measurement of socioeconomic
inequalities in mortality (e.g. by reclassification of the
original individual-level data into common occupational
class and educational level schemes), there may be
residual comparability problems which affect our
results. Examples are differences in study design (longi-
tudinal or unlinked cross-sectional), in year of study
(early 1980s or whole decade), and in the measurement
of occupation (approximate EGP schemes in some
countries, correction for exclusion of economically inac-
tive men). Elsewhere we have made an extensive evalu-
ation of these residual comparability problems[12,15], and
our conclusion was that the margins of uncertainty are
wide and differ in width between countries and socioeco-
nomic indicators. Due to a cumulation of various data
problems, the margins of uncertainty are particularly
wide for inequalities by occupational class in Ireland,
Spain and Portugal. Most countries with wide margins
of uncertainty have small inequalities in cardiovascular
disease mortality, but there is no reason to assume that
the net effect of the residual comparability problems is to
underestimate inequalities in mortality: some problems
may produce bias in an upward, others in a downward
direction[12,15]. Nevertheless, it is good to be careful in
drawing conclusions, and to focus on the overall picture,
not on one of these countries in isolation.
The data on behavioural risk factors from the Euro-
barometer surveys are based on identical questions in
each country, but the phrasing of the questions on
smoking in the national surveys slightly differed between
countries. It is unlikely that this has seriously biased our
results, because the correlations between inequalities in
smoking and inequalities in mortality were very similar
for the Eurobarometer and the national surveys (Table
3). A more important source of bias might be that the
behavioural risk factor data are entirely based on self-
reports. Misreporting (recall bias, social desirability, . . .)
may be associated with socioeconomic status[29­31], but
the main question for our study is whether this associ-
ation differs between countries. Similarly, non-response
may be associated with socioeconomic status[32,33], and
although a Swedish study showed that socioeconomic
inequalities in smoking are not very sensitive to differ-
ences between responders and non-responders in smok-
ing[34], we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of bias
in the international pattern of socioeconomic inequali-
ties in risk factors as observed in our study. It is unlikely
that better data will become available in the foreseeable
future.
Unfortunately, the mortality and risk factor data
came from different sources, and a direct assessment of
the contribution of these risk factors to inequalities in
cardiovascular mortality between individuals inside each
country was impossible. Instead, we combined these
data in a cross-national analysis, and the results of this
aggregate level or `ecological' analysis should not be
taken as indicative of the corresponding individual level
relationships. For example, a cross-national correlation

ischaemic heart disease mortality of 1·00 would not
imply that within each country all between-individual
inequalities in ischaemic heart disease mortality are due
to inequalities in smoking. Nevertheless, the high cross-
national correlations which we found for smoking and
ischaemic heart disease can only be meaningfully inter-
preted if smoking is important at the individual level
too -- which of course it is. There is even some evidence
that the relative excess risk of ischaemic heart disease
due to smoking is larger in the lower social classes,
possibly because of an interaction of smoking with other
risk factors[35]. This increases the likelihood that
inequalities in smoking are very important for the
explanation of inequalities in cardiovascular mortality.
The inequalities in risk factors were measured on the
basis of data collected around 1990, while the inequali-
ties in mortality were measured on the basis of data
collected in the early or full 1980s. In order to improve
the link between these two types of data, we took care to
measure inequalities in risk factors in the same cohorts
as the mortality data (see data and methods section).
This procedure is based on the assumption that within
these cohorts, inequalities in risk factors have not
changed between the early 1980s and around 1990. We
do not know whether this assumption holds. Several
national studies have documented a widening of in-
equalities in smoking behaviour during the 1980s[36­39]
and a similar widening may have occurred for other risk
factors. We consider it unlikely, however, that this has
seriously biased our results. The trends in the social
patterning of the smoking epidemic are slow and similar
trends have been observed in many countries, so that
substantial changes in the international pattern of
inequalities in smoking within a ten-year period are
unlikely.
Interpretation
Systematic international comparisons of socioeconomic
inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality have
seldom been made, but those that have included a
smaller range of countries, and paid less attention to
potential comparability problems[40­42]. Our study con-
firms previous reports on smaller inequalities in cardio-
vascular disease mortality in southern Europe[41­42], and
also provides some clues as to the possible causes of this
situation.
The main contributor to this international pattern is
ischaemic heart disease mortality, and it is likely that the
smaller (perhaps even `reversed') inequalities in ischae-
mic heart disease mortality are at least partly due to
differences with northern Europe in the social patterning
of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. In south-
ern Europe, smoking is less frequent in the lower socio-
economic groups, and this is likely to reflect an early
stage in the smoking epidemic: in many countries in
northern Europe and in the U.S.A., uptake of smoking
started in the higher socioeconomic groups, and so did
stopping smoking[43­45]. In southern Europe, inequalities
in excessive alcohol consumption are also smaller than
in northern Europe. Perhaps surprisingly, the largest
odds ratios for excessive alcohol consumption (>4
glasses/day) were found in England and Wales
(OR=2·07). As excessive alcohol consumption increases
the risk of ischaemic heart and cerebrovascular disease
mortality[46­48] this may help to explain the larger in-
equalities in cardiovascular disease mortality, although
inequalities in excessive alcohol consumption are corre-
lated with inequalities in smoking, and the latter may
thus act as confounders.
The international pattern of inequalities in excessive
alcohol consumption changed slightly upon increasing
the lower limit to 6 glasses/day. England and Wales still
has the largest inequalities (OR=3·99), but Spain now
ranks second. The correlation with inequalities in car-
diovascular disease mortality declined from 0·89 (Table
3) to 0·57 (results not shown). A similar decline occurred
for ischaemic heart disease mortality (from 0·83 to 0·41)
but not for cerebrovascular disease mortality (from 0·88
to 0·72), suggesting that inequalities in very excessive
alcohol consumption are more important for the latter.
There is less evidence in our data for a contribution
from the traditional Mediterranean diet, which has been
claimed to have cardioprotective effects[49,50] and which
is likely to be more prevalent in the lower than in the
higher socioeconomic groups in southern Europe[51].
This may be due to the fact that the only dietary factor
(other than alcohol consumption) for which we had data
is lack of fresh vegetables, which only covers one aspect
of the Mediterranean diet. Although inequalities in this
variable are smaller in southern Europe, the correlation
with inequalities in ischaemic heart disease mortality
was only moderately positive (Table 3). It is puzzling
that inequalities in overweight are not clearly associated
with inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality.
This is perhaps due to confounding between risk factors.
More generally, it is unfortunate that many risk factors
for cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure,
dyslipidaemia, diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle, could
not be examined in this study.
This interpretation of our results fits into the popular
`diffusion theory' of the epidemic of ischaemic heart
disease mortality[52­54]. According to this theory, the rise
of ischaemic heart disease started in the higher socioeco-
nomic groups in the richer countries, because these were
the first who appreciated and could afford the behav-
iours (smoking, a diet rich in saturated fats, lack of
physical exercise, . . .) which increase the risk of ischae-
mic heart disease. From them the disease spread to other
populations (lower socioeconomic groups, poorer
countries), partly as a result of rising living standards,
partly as a result of imitation. When the epidemic
started to decline, the higher socioeconomic groups in
the richer countries were again the first to benefit,
because they were the first to adopt the behavioural
changes (stopping smoking, less saturated fat, more
exercise) which were required for a reduction in risk of
ischaemic heart disease. As a result, the well-known
inverse gradient of ischaemic heart disease mortality
1148 J. P. Mackenbach et al.
Eur Heart J, Vol. 21, issue 14, July 2000
emerged. From this perspective, the situation in
southern Europe, particularly Portugal with its higher
ischaemic heart disease mortality in the higher socioeco-
nomic groups, may represent a pre- or early epidemic
stage, from which an epidemic of ischaemic heart disease
and/or inverse gradients could still develop. Although
there is no evidence of rising mortality from ischaemic
heart disease in southern Europe, reports from Spain
and France suggest that inverse gradients of ischaemic
heart disease mortality have emerged during the
1980s[55,56]. Also, an analysis of age-specific prevalences
of smoking shows that inverse gradients of cigarette
smoking had emerged among young men in southern
Europe around 1990[57].
The fact that inequalities in cerebrovascular disease
mortality are not smaller in southern Europe is difficult
to understand on the basis of our data alone. Correla-
tions with inequalities in risk factors, particularly smok-
ing and excessive alcohol consumption, are generally the
same for ischaemic heart disease and for cerebrovascular
disease mortality (Table 3), although inequalities in very
excessive alcohol consumption have higher correlations
with the latter. It is likely, therefore, that other risk
factors are involved, such as other components of the
Mediterranean diet. Although the Mediterranean diet
protects against ischaemic heart disease, the relatively
high rates of cerebrovascular disease mortality in
southern Europe suggest that it may increase the risk
of cerebrovascular disease, for example through high
sodium intakes[58,59]. If lower socioeconomic groups
in southern Europe still more frequently observe the
traditional diet, this would at least partly explain the
lower rates of ischaemic heart disease mortality and
the higher rates of cerebrovascular disease mortality.
Differences between countries in blood pressure control,
and particularly in accessibility of blood pressure con-
trol to lower socioeconomic groups, are another possible
explanation.
It is interesting to note that the U.S.A. occupies an
intermediate position between northern and southern
Europe, at least with regard to inequalities in total
cardiovascular disease mortality. This may reflect the
more heterogeneous nature of the U.S.A. population,
which may average out the experience of some subpopu-
lations with larger inequalities. In a further analysis of
the U.S.A. data, however, we found no evidence of
systematic differences between ethnic groups in the size
of inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality
(results not shown). Unfortunately, we were not able to
analyse the U.S.A. data by country of birth, so that we
could not compare inequalities among whites of north-
ern European descent with those among whites of
southern European descent.
Our emphasis on behavioural risk factors should not
distract from the fact that these are themselves closely
linked to material and/or structural factors[60]. Stronks
et al.[61] showed that in the Netherlands 20­40% of the
difference in smoking behaviour between socioeconomic
groups appeared to be associated with adverse material
conditions. Also qualitative studies, most of which were
carried out in the United Kingdom, indicate that adverse
material circumstances may induce people to smoke,
and hinder stopping smoking[43]. Smoking and other
behavioural risk factors such as excessive alcohol con-
sumption may be considered as a way of coping with
adverse circumstances.
In conclusion, our international comparison shows
that (1) in most of the countries included in our study,
socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular disease
mortality are a major challenge to public health, and in
the few countries where they are not, they may well
become so in the future; (2) these inequalities are partly
based on inequalities in behavioural risk factors, and
developing methods to improve health-related behav-
iour in the lower socioeconomic groups should be a
priority in cardiovascular disease prevention.
This study was supported by a grant from the European Union's
Biomed-1 program (CT92-1068). The central statistical offices of
all participating countries gave permission for the use of unpub-
lished data from national mortality registries. Data for the United
States were obtained from the public use file of the National
Longitudinal Mortality Study (1979­1989).
