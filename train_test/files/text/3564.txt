Effects of a golf swing intervention
on senior golfers' ball striking
and motivation to play golf
Kiran D Kanwar and Mark D Mann
Abstract
Several golf swing movements have been correlated with the production of club speed in skilled golfers. However, less
skilled golfers, such as senior golfers, may not be capable of many of those movements. One golf swing--Minimalist Golf
Swing--reduces the downswing range of motion through which a golfer's body must move to reach the impact positions
seen in skilled golfers. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the MGS could improve senior golfers' ball flight
and consistency, and increase their motivation to play golf. Twenty-two seniors (16 males, 6 females), aged 54­81,
participated in an 11-session study comprising pretest, intervention, and posttest sessions. During the test sessions,
participants hit 20 shots with each of their own 6-iron and driver clubs. Ball movement immediately after impact was
measured using a camera-based ball launch monitor. Participants' motivation to play golf before and after the intervention
was assessed using the Sports Motivation Scale II. A mixed effects model was used for the statistical analysis of this
repeated measures study, in which participants served as their own controls. Statistically significant per-session results
were an increase in the ball's speed (6-iron and driver) and trajectory (6-iron), and a change in direction (both clubs)
from left to slightly right (for right handed golfers). Consistency of ball flight, total motivation and intrinsic motivation
increased slightly post-intervention, while amotivation decreased, none significantly. Therefore, some senior golfers can
improve ball flight, consistency, and motivation to play golf after six MGS training sessions.

The full swing in golf is considered to be one of the
most difficult biomechanical motions to execute.1
Although individual styles vary considerably,
most swings are generally either classic or modern.
The modern swing has been increasingly used over
the past 60 years,2 and aims at achieving greater club
speed through vertical and horizontal (lateral) acceler-
ation of the body's hub (located approximately between
the shoulders), during the downswing. Club speed, and
the movements generating it, moreover, is what most
golf swing researchers have typically focused on, while
research has ignored the movements that might gener-
ate better direction. In addition, there is little research
to indicate how less-skilled golfers might achieve the
downswing movements which are associated with
greater club speed in skilled golfers.
Skilled golfers have been observed to be able to
move through a considerable range of vertical, lateral
and rotational movement during the downswing to
reach the impact positions which are said to translate
to greater club speed. Less skilled golfers, however, do
not have the strength and speed to move through the
same range of motion, which is not surprising as the
golf downswing lasts only between 0.27 and 0.34s3 for
all golfers, regardless of skill level.
Vertical acceleration is achieved by an upward move-
ment of the hub during the downswing. It was shown4
to be significantly higher ( p < .01) in elite golfers
(M ¼ 139.5cm, SD ¼ 4.8 cm) than in novice golfers
(M ¼ 118.7 cm, SD ¼ 18.3 cm). The lateral movement
that contributes to greater club speed is termed ``weight
shift''. In a comparison of skilled versus nonskilled

golfers, it was seen that the former shifted weight (from
the trail foot, i.e. right foot for a right-handed golfer) by
12.3 Æ 3.7cm towards the lead foot (left foot for a right-
handed golfer) during the downswing, while the latter
showed less, and delayed, weight-shift.1 Finally, rota-
tional acceleration takes place in a proximal-to-distal
sequence, much like a stack of discs that rotate about
the same axis, with the larger disc below imparting its
energy to the smaller one above it, in keeping with a
summation-of-speed principle.5 During the downswing,
professional golfers had a significantly higher ( p < .011)
average pelvic rotational acceleration of 2.1 kd/s2 Æ 0.4
compared to amateurs' 1.5 kd/s2 Æ 0.4, and a significantly
higher ( p< .011) average thorax rotational acceleration
of 3.3 kd/s2 Æ 0.5 compared to amateurs' 2.3 kd/s2 Æ 0.5.5
One solution for less skilled golfers to reach some of
the impact positions seen in their more skilled counter-
parts might be to reduce the vertical and lateral range of
motion through which they have to move during the short
time frame of the downswing, as both involve a move-
ment of the body's center of mass through some distance.
These movements could be replaced by an increased
rotary range of motion about a longitudinal axis.
One golf swing--the Minimalist Golf Swing
(MGS)--requires a golfer to maintain the lead shoulder
higher, and the body's weight closer to target, than typ-
ically seen, from set-up to the top of the backswing. It
thus requires less vertical and lateral body-movement
during the downswing, to help a golfer get into suitable
impact positions within the short time frame of the
downswing. At the same time, it is designed to increase
rotational range of motion, and thus acceleration,
through a pre-swing rotation of the torso, which is pos-
itioned to face away from target. The MGS has been
shown, in a previous study, to produce greater club-
head speed for a mixed age-group of golfers over a
single-session swing change.6
A population for whom there may be benefits to the
use of the MGS, based on its purported advantages,
might be senior golfers (aged 50 years and above),
because aging is associated with diminished perform-
ance due to a reduction in muscle-strength, speed,
flexibility and range of motion.7 Senior golfers, there-
fore, are unable to move through the large range of
motion that elite golfers do, as their motor performance
becomes slower and less consistent with age,7 which
loss of speed reduces their ability to hit the golf ball
long distances with the full-swing.8 Moreover, while
concentric and isometric strength reduce with age, it
is known that eccentric muscle performance is retained
to a greater extent,9 and this is a concept the MGS
capitalizes on through its greater range of torso rota-
tion, in the expectation of club speed gains.
The loss of ball-distance and trajectory (which
together with direction constitute ball flight) are
important factors for performance.10 An attenuation of
performance might cause senior golfers to be less likely
to be attracted to, and retained by, golf. This might
occur because humans have a need for feelings of com-
petence and autonomy,11 and are known to engage in
tasks ``. . .in which they feel competent and confident and
avoid those in which they do not''.12 If the MGS is able
to improve ball flight for senior golfers, it might also
increase their motivation to play golf.
The purpose of this study, therefore, was to assess
whether the MGS intervention could, for a mixed
group of senior golfers, improve actual ball striking
(ball speed, trajectory and direction), consistency of ball
striking, as well as the motivation to play golf, while using
two different golf clubs which have considerably different
performance characteristics. It was hypothesized that
ball-striking would improve with respect to ball speed
and trajectory, while direction would change from start-
ing randomly left or right, to starting either straight or
slightly towards the right (for the right-handed golfer).
It was also hypothesized that ball-striking consistency
(as assessed by the standard deviation of each outcome),
would be improved. Finally, it was hypothesized that
overall motivation and intrinsic motivation would
increase, while amotivation would decrease.
Methods
Participants
Twenty-two male and female golfers over the age of 50
years were recruited for this study. A G*Power 3 post
hoc power analysis13 for this single-group, repeated
measures study of 22 participants and three dependent
variables, with a significance level of a ¼ .05, and a
Cohen's d effect size of 0.7, resulted in a power of
0.8. Convenience as well as snowball sampling tech-
niques were used, and golfers were recruited from the
Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex area. All participants
signed an informed consent form approved by Texas
Woman's University's Institutional Review Board,
prior to the commencement of the study. Inclusion cri-
terion was age above 50 years. Exclusion was based on
a history of musculoskeletal injury or surgery which
might prevent them from making a full-swing range
of motion repeatedly, for one hour.
Experimental procedure
Participants attended 11 one-hour sessions and hit
Callaway Big Bertha brand golf balls off a mat, into a
net in an indoor location. Participants used their own
6-iron and driver clubs, and chose one of two tee
heights for the driver shots. They were asked to wear
whatever apparel, shoes and glove they typically wear
608 International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching 13(4)
while playing golf. Prior to each of the 11 sessions, par-
ticipants warmed up in their usual fashion--either by
hitting some shots or through some stretching exercises,
or both. Session 1 was the baseline, pretest session,
and was used to measure the ball-striking capabilities
of participants' existing swings. During this session,
participants hit 20 balls with each of their 6-iron and
driver clubs. This large number of shots was chosen
as it was expected to adequately represent a baseline
measurement. Sessions 5, 6, 10 and 11 were posttest ses-
sions, intended to study changes at different time points
after the commencement of the intervention. During
these sessions, too, participants hit 20 balls per club.
The remaining six sessions were training sessions for
the interventional golf swing (MGS).
The 18-question revised Sports Motivation Scale II
(SMS II) was administered before commencement of
session 1 and upon completion of session 11, to assess
changes in motivation. It has been assessed to be a valid
and reliable measurement tool, and all subscales have a
Cronbach's a ! .70. SMS II assesses six sub-scales of
motivation--intrinsic, integrated, identified, intro-
jected, external and amotivated. Motivation is ``intrin-
sic'' when it is self-driven, is ``integrated'' when a
person feels it is the essence of who they are, is ``iden-
tified'' when an activity is self-chosen, is ``introjected''
because it self-reflects a person's worth, and is ``exter-
nal'' when it involves others' opinions. The SMS II
generates an overall score of motivation, the Relative
Autonomy Index (RAI) score, which indicates the
autonomy level of a person's motivation.11
Instructions for interventional swing technique
Standardized instructions that were given to all participants.
. Set-up: Posture as upright as possible, using minimal
hip and knee flexion. Rotate the torso to face away
from target. Tilt the head towards the trail shoulder.
. Backswing: While maintaining the trail-side lateral
flexion of the set-up, and keeping the lead arm close
to the chest, lift it as high as it is able to go (no
restriction to arms' backswing length). Avoid any
side-to-side, up-and-down or rotary movements of
the torso during the backswing.
. Downswing: Continue to maintain the head's trail-
side lateral flexion. No other swing thoughts are
required (Figures 1 and 2).
Explanations that were made to all participants.
. No golfer gets into precisely the recommended
positions, but any change made, to whatever extent
possible, will show ball-striking improvement.
. The ``magic move'' of the MGS is maintaining the
trail side's (especially the head's) lateral flexion
throughout the backswing.
­ It makes returning the club to the ball on the
ground each time more likely, as the body has
not moved up and down or side-to-side during
the backswing.
­ It positions the trail arm in ``external rotation'',
which makes it more likely that the club will
arrive at the ball from the ``inside'' rather than
``over the top'', for better directional control.
­ It automatically cuts off any over-long
backswing.
. No downswing thought is required, except to main-
tain the head's tilted position. The MGS backswing
sets up important joints like a row of dominoes--the
movement of one piece triggers the sequential move-
ment of the rest.
Data collection
The equipment used for data collection was a Foresight
Sports GC2 golf ball launch monitor. It is a high-reso-
lution, camera-based system which uses stereoscopic
lenses for spatial recognition and has a data-capture
capability of up to 10,000 frames per second.
The system has an internal accelerometer which
corrects for non-level surfaces. It has a reported accur-
acy tolerance of Æ0.5 mph (0.22 m/s) for ball speed,
Æ0.2 for vertical launch angle (trajectory), and Æ1.0
for azimuth (direction), according to the user-manual
of the product.14 Calibration was performed prior to
each session by placing the launch monitor perpendicu-
lar to the target line, using a golf-specific alignment
stick. The three dependent variables measured using
this device were ball speed, trajectory and direction
(left or right of target) at the start of the ball's flight,
immediately after impact with the club.
Data analysis
This study had a pretest­posttest repeated measures
design, in which participants served as their own con-
trols. The independent variable was the golf swing pre-
and post-intervention, and the dependent variables
were three important indicators of ball flight--ball
speed, trajectory and direction, measured at club-ball
impact. In a similar golf study, measurements had been
nested within participants and multilevel analysis
used.15 Thus, a mixed effects model, also known as a
multilevel model, was used in this study, and the three
dependent variables of ball speed, trajectory and direc-
tion (level 1) were nested within the individual golfer
(level 2). The main predictor (independent) variable in
Kanwar and Mann 609
the model was the session number, which served to
indicate ball flight changes from the use of existing
swings (pretest) and then interventional swings
(posttest), over the duration of the study. Other fixed-
effect predictors used were the gender of the participant
(male, with female as baseline), age, years playing golf
and pre-intervention motivation. Skill level was not
used as a predictor in this model because most senior
participants did not keep a record of their scores while
playing golf. The random effect of the model was the
individual golfer. The multi-level (mixed effects) model
was developed by starting with a basic fixed-effects only
version.16 After testing for significance of the fixed
effects, the random effect of individual participants
was incorporated into the model.
While ball flight is an important consideration for a
golfer, so too is consistency of ball contact. This was
assessed from the standard deviation, and was calcu-
lated separately for each aspect of ball flight. Finally,
pre- and post-intervention motivation--total, intrinsic
and amotivation--were compared using a paired sam-
ples t-test. A significance level of a ¼ .05 was set for all
tests, and SPSS 24.0 was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
Descriptive statistics
A total of 22 senior golfers, 16 males and 6 females,
participated in the study. Ages ranged from 54­81
years, M ¼ 67.7 and SD ¼ 7.6 (males: M ¼ 67.3,
SD ¼ 7.3; females: M ¼ 68.8, SD ¼ 9). When separated
by age groups, there were three participants in the
50­59 age group, nine in each of the 60­69 and 70­79
age groups, and one in the 80­89 age group.
Participants' experience with respect to number of
years playing golf ranged from 1 year to 61 years,
M ¼ 29.7, SD ¼ 18.8. Eight participants reported handi-
caps between À7 and À17, while the rest did not
typically keep score. Although not recorded, most
said they played golf frequently. No shots that were
recorded by the launch monitor were discarded, regard-
less of the quality of ball-flight, in order to assess real-
istic levels of central tendency and variability achieved
by the intervention. Overall pre-intervention total
motivation measured using the SMS II scale, was
M ¼ 50, SD ¼ 23.1 (men: M ¼ 50.3, SD ¼ 20.9; women
M ¼ 49.1, SD ¼ 30.5), of a maximum possible score of
108. Means and standard deviations for the 6-iron and
driver clubs, assessed during the five measurement ses-
sions, for all participants, female participants only, and
male participants only, are reported in Tables 1 to 3,
respectively.
Mean baseline measurements of ball speed, launch
angle, and direction with all participants' original pre-
test swings (Table 1, session 1) for 6-iron and driver
were: 33 m/s (SD ¼ 9.9); 16.7 (SD ¼ 6.0); À0.9
(SD ¼ 7.2); and 41.9 m/s (SD ¼ 12); 13 (SD ¼ 6.7),
À2.8 (SD ¼ 6.4) respectively. Females' baseline pretest
ball-striking measurements (Table 2, session 1) for 6-
iron and driver were: 23.4 m/s (SD ¼ 6.7); 14.9
(SD ¼ 5.9); À1.1 (SD ¼ 7.8); and 29.3 m/s (SD ¼ 8.3);
12.5 (SD ¼ 7.6); À1.3 (SD ¼ 8.1), respectively.
Male golfers' baseline pretest ball-striking measure-
ments (Table 3, session 1) for 6-iron and driver respect-
ively were: 36.6 m/s (SD ¼ 8.5); 17.4 (SD ¼ 5.9); À0.8
(SD ¼ 7.0); and 46.6 m/s (SD ¼ 9.5); 14.0 (SD ¼ 6.2);
À3.3 (SD ¼ 5.6) respectively. A measurement in m/s
converts to approximately 2.24 mph.
Mixed effects model statistics
The relationship between session number (the main pre-
dictor) and the respective dependent variables showed
significant variance in intercepts across participants,
with p < .01 in all cases. Thus randomization of the
intercepts of the model was justified because the
respective dependent variables showed significant

(seen from the 2 test) variance, across participants. In
other words, a mixed effects model is a suitable one to
use when variability in ball flight already exists between
participants prior to the commencement of the study.
The mixed effect analyses showed a significant effect
of session on all three measures of 6-iron ball flight: ball
speed b ¼ (0.2), t(2128.3) ¼ 3.0, p ¼ .002, ball trajectory
b ¼ (0.3), t(2123.6) ¼ 3.1, p ¼ .002, and ball direction
b ¼ (0.6), t(2125.5) ¼ 3.1, p < .001. Thus, per measure-
ment session, 6-iron ball speed increased significantly
( p < .01) by an average of 0.2 m/s (0.45 mph); trajectory
increased significantly ( p < .01) by an average of 0.3;
and direction moved significantly ( p < .001) right (for
right-handed golfers) by an average of 0.6.
Similarly, the effect of session on two measures of
ball flight (speed and direction) were significant for the
driver: ball speed b ¼ (0.2), t(2158.1) ¼ 2.4, p ¼ .016,
ball trajectory b ¼ (À0.2), t(2157.2) ¼ À1.8, p ¼ .075
and ball direction b ¼ (0.9), t(2158.2) ¼ 10.2, p < .001.
In other words, per measurement-session, driver speed
increased significantly ( p ¼ .016) by an average of
0.2 m/s (0.45 mph); and direction moved significantly
( p < .001) right by an average of 0.9. There was no
significant change in driver trajectory. All of the
above results were obtained while controlling for
gender (male), age, pre-intervention motivation and
years playing golf. All the fixed factors--session,
gender, age, pre-intervention motivation and number
of years playing golf--that produced significant effects
on the three aspects of ball flight are listed in Table 4.
Finally, effect size has not been reported because no
consensus exists17 on an appropriate calculation of it
for a mixed effects model. However, the post hoc power
analysis of this study did input a Cohen's d effect size of
0.7, which is considered to be medium-large.
Motivation statistics
There was a mean increase of 3.4 and 2.1 in total motiv-
ation and intrinsic motivation, respectively, and a mean
decrease of 1.3 in amotivation; none were statistically
significant. Of the 21 participants who completed the
SMS II questionnaire, 17 had increased (11), or the
same (6), intrinsic motivation after the golf swing
intervention.
Discussion
This was the first study in golf involving a complete
swing change, and was also the first interventional

study for senior golfers. The intervention in this study
involved a change of most set-up and backswing pos-
itions and movements, and even resulted in some par-
ticipants feeling that their grips had changed.
Moreover, most participants reported not having had
any golf lessons, initially making so many simultaneous
swing changes disconcerting.
The participants in the present study (which included
many golfers over age 65, as well as six female golfers)
had average pre-intervention baseline (Table 1) 6-iron

ball speeds of 33.0 (Æ 9.9) m/s or 74 mph, and driver
ball speeds of 41.9 m/s (Æ 12.0) or 94 mph. The average
driver ball speed would therefore convert to a club
speed of approximately 63 mph using a conversion
(smash) factor of 1.5,22 (Joseph, n.d.), which is within
the driver speed range found by Little10 to be between
55 and 75 mph, for most women, senior men, juniors
and beginners. His study found that such golfers also
had very low trajectory, which together resulted in very
small total distance.
Discussion of descriptive statistics
Outcome measures for ball speed, trajectory and direction
for all sessions and both clubs are reported in Tables 1
(all participants), 2 (females only) and 3 (males only).
However, this descriptive statistics' discussion section
compares results from the pretest and the penultimate
posttest sessions, as it was expected that participants'
anxiety during the final session, from ``trying too hard'',
would negatively affect their performance during that
session. It is known that skill acquisition is a gradual
process, affected by anxiety and fatigue.18
Ball speed and trajectory
In the present study, ball speed (Table 1) increased by
an average of 0.8 m/s (1.8 mph) for the 6-iron and by
0.6 (1.3 mph) for the driver, when comparing results for
all participants from the pretest and the penultimate
posttest session. Ball trajectory increased by an average
of 1.5 for the 6-iron and decreased by 0.1 for the
driver during the same two sessions. For male golfers,
average 6-iron ball speed increased by 0.2 m/s and
driver speed by 0.3m/s. Their average 6-iron ball trajec-
tory increased by 0.4 and driver ball trajectory by 0.3.
None of these changes was statistically significant. For
female golfers, average 6-iron ball speed increased by
2.4 m/s (significant, p < .01) and driver speed by 1.7m/s.
Their average 6-iron trajectory increased by 4.3 (signifi-
cant, p < .05) and driver trajectory decreased by 0.9.
Typically, while movement skills are being acquired, a
trade-off between accuracy and speed of movement is
expected, with one happening at the cost of the other.19
However, this was not the case in the present study, in
which accuracy was judged by trajectory or the vertical
launch angle in degrees, which would be excessively
decreased in the absence of precision of ball contact.
An increase in ball speed and/or trajectory would be
expected to improve ball distance. According to the
Trackman golf ball launch monitor manufacturer,23 a
gain of 1 mph (0.45 m/s) of ball speed can increase
driver distance by up to 2 yds (1.8 m). In addition,
according to an instruction article on the PGA
TOUR website,20 ``The general rule of thumb is: the
lower your clubhead speed and ball speed, the higher
you need to launch the ball.''
Although not quantified through biomechanical
analysis or video recordings, the MGS is designed to
increase rotational acceleration by moving the pelvis
from a closed (facing away from target) to a square
and finally an open position, during the downswing.
This movement is expected to have a greater
``X-Factor Stretch'' effect, as there is likely to be greater
downswing separation of the hips and shoulders (which
is expected to lag behind during the downswing because
of the lateral torso- and head-tilt away from target).
The greater separation,5 in turn, is said to increase
eccentric muscle contraction, known to be beneficial
for seniors.
While greater increases in ball speed might be
expected from an 11-session study, with or without an
intervention, the authors believe that the large number
of changes that senior golfers had to make all at once
may have required more than the six training sessions
to stabilize, especially as poor shots were not discarded
during any of the measurement sessions.
Ball direction
At the commencement of this study (Tables 1 and 2), the
average starting (i.e. immediately post-impact) direction
was to the left À0.9 for 6-iron and À2.8 for the driver.
In addition, average starting directions for females and
males, respectively, were À1.1 and À0.8 for the 6-iron,
and À1.3 and À3.3 for the driver. This reflects the
expectations of the Perfect Golf Swing Review website's
section on ball flight laws,21 which states that beginner
golfers tend to hit the ball starting off to the left of
target. Comparing the pretest to the penultimate posttest
for all participants, there was a change in direction from
an average of À0.9 to 3.0 with the 6-iron, and an aver-
age of À2.8 to 1.0 for the driver (both significant,
p < .01). While female golfers also showed a change in
starting direction from the left, changes were not signifi-
cant for either club. Male golfers' starting direction
changed significantly from left to slightly right, for
both clubs ( p < .01). With the interventional swing
method, the starting direction of the ball is expected to
be either straight or slightly right of center only, and not
randomly left or right, because the pre-swing torso rota-
tion of the MGS positions the body to face away from
target. The arms, therefore, would not be expected to
easily pull across the torso and to the left while the
torso was facing right (for a right-handed golfer).
Consistency
Standard deviation (SD) was used to indicate reduced
variability or greater consistency of shot making, with
Kanwar and Mann 613
respect to post-impact ball speed, trajectory and direc-
tion (Tables 1 to 3). SD for speed decreased for both
clubs, for all participants, females only and males only.
SD for trajectory also decreased for all three categories
with the driver. Finally, directional SD decreased for all
three categories for the 6-iron, and for all participants
as well as females only for the driver. No statistical
significance was seen in any of the changes. Although
not quantified in this study, the MGS is expected to
show greater consistency because the trail-side lateral
tilt of the head and torso during the backswing, com-
bined with no in-swing rotation, allows the club to
return to a more precise position every time.
Novice and intermediate players (as seen in a table
tennis study) typically show greater inconsistency close
to impact during the skill acquisition phase.18 However,
the MGS with its curtailed overall degrees of freedom
of joint movements would be expected to subject senior
golfers to less inconsistency even during the movement
acquisition phase.
Discussion of the mixed effects model
This discussion incorporates all results from the pretest,
as well as all four posttest sessions. The 6-iron and
driver speeds both increased significantly by a mean
of 0.2 m/s (0.45 mph) per measurement-session.
Trajectory increased significantly per session by a
mean of 0.3 for the 6-iron, and direction changed sig-
nificantly by a mean of 0.6 and 0.9 from left to right
for the 6-iron and driver, respectively, per session. All
of the above results were obtained while controlling for
the fixed effects of gender, age, motivation pre-interven-
tion, and years playing golf. Many of the other pre-
dictor variables (fixed effects) also significantly
affected ball speed, trajectory, and direction (Table 3).
For instance, 6-iron mean speed increased by 0.2 m/s per
measurement session over time, by 0.6 m/s per year
decrease in age, by 0.1 m/s per unit of pre-intervention
motivation, and by 9.8 m/s for males as compared to
females. Driver mean speed increased by 0.2 m/s per
measurement session, by 0.7 m/s per year decrease in
age, by 0.1 m/s per unit increase in pre-intervention
motivation, and by 14.6m/s for males as compared to
females. The results show that a slow but steady
improvement took place over the duration of this
study. All significant effects of all predictor variables,
on the three dependent variables of this study, as seen
from the mixed effects model, are listed in Table 4. Non-
significant results have not been included in the table.
Motivation
Although there was no statistically significant improve-
ment in total motivation, intrinsic motivation, or
amotivation in this study, 17 of the 21 participants
who completed the SMS II scale were seen to either
increase (11) or maintain (6) intrinsic motivation after
the study. This might indicate that they either felt that
further practice would continue to improve their ball
flight past the improvements already seen, or that the
highly precise steps for the set-up and backswing gave
them something extremely specific to work towards, to
help them to attain desirable results.
Limitations and future studies
One limitation of this study was that there was no
comparison group of participants who either only prac-
ticed, or who were trained in some other interventional
swing method. It was felt to be important to use a
repeated measures design with participants acting as
their own controls, to show greater homogeneity
between pretest and posttests. Moreover, it was not
possible to use the same participants for 11 sessions
of no/alternate intervention and then for the MGS
intervention because of time constraints. Additionally,
the authors believed that the number of pretest
shots--20 per club--would adequately represent the
existing, typical performance of these golfers, most of
whom claim to play frequently. Based on this limita-
tion, an attempt was made to control internal validity
as strictly as possible. Threats to internal validity such
as history, maturation, statistical regression, selection,
mortality and testing, were controlled through the use
of a very short-term, repeated measures design with
completely different movements pre- and post-interven-
tion. Equipment was calibrated prior to the commence-
ment of each session to contain any internal validity
threat from instrumentation. A second limitation of
this study was that no actual movements were mea-
sured or recorded, as it was cost-prohibitive to do so.
Third, in order to limit the number of dependent
variables used, side spin and back spin were not
measured. Side spin combined with starting direction
of the ball together determine the ending position of a
golf ball on a fairway.14 Side spin is especially import-
ant for the MGS, in which, after the rightward start
(for a right-handed golfer) seen in this study, the ball
would be expected to curve back leftwards, towards the
center of the fairway, in what is termed a draw pattern.
Future studies could include a measurement of all
the important movements, forces, and torques of
golfers' pre- and post-interventional swings, while com-
paring the MGS with other swing methods or studying
the MGS for elite golfers, long-drivers, and juniors.
It may also be surmised from the present study that
six training sessions may not be adequate for senior
golfers, and that, in the future, more training sessions
spread out over some months might be more
614 International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching 13(4)
informative. It would also be beneficial to have a
matched control group that only practiced their
swings without any intervention, over the same dur-
ation. A longitudinal study assessing the swing during
play as well as during more randomized practice over a
longer duration might also be informative.
In conclusion, the MGS, despite involving a
complete change of set-up and backswing, can be per-
formed fairly consistently in the relatively short time of
six training sessions, by senior golfers who are typically
slower to learn new motor skills. Thus, adopting the
MGS swing may help to improve some senior
golfers' existing ball-flight and their motivation to
play golf.
