The Ontology of Personhood:
Distinguishing Sober from
Enthusiastic Personalised
Medicine

Abstract
In light of the successful occupation of the term `person' for Personalised Medicine, it is necessary
to ask what different notions of personhood practically imply. This article examines two. The
first is the reductionist molecular individual, embraced by PM enthusiasts. Here the person is
a contradictory dividuum, oscillating between increased autonomy and a new, infantilising tech-
paternalism. The second relies on a Christ-analogical distinction of two modes. The dramatic
amplitude of personal absence-presence then unfolds throughout time. This provides the logic
or spirit of the medical act. Drawing on the ethics of war, it will be recast as an arduous task of
mending.

Introduction
Personalised or individualised medicine (PM) has been described as a revolution in med-
icine. Determining a person's genetic and molecular profile is associated with earlier
disease detection, a stratification of patient groups, and targeted treatment of diseases.
Early successes, such as the drug imatinib for a specific sub-group of patients with
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), seems to have inaugurated the age of PM--`the
right treatment for the right person at the right time'.1

Peter Dabrock once noted that `the mere fact that the word-creation "individualised
medicine" raises no eyebrows, because today only very few people still think this is a
pleonasm, surely must be understood as a phenomenon of the crisis of medicine and the
vocation of the physician'. In an effort to deconstruct the `language politics' of PM,
Dabrock emphasises that the use of the term personhood, `(even more so than "individu-
ality")' for `a natural-scientific technique of differentiation, can under no circumstances
be seen as even remotely innocent'. Personhood `at least in the broad stream of the tradi-
tion comprising trinitarian theology, personalism, phenomenology, and social psychol-
ogy--develops only in social togetherness'.2 The currently successful occupation of the
term `person', however, may well indicate that such `classical horizons of philosophical-
theological anthropology' have somewhat `begun to darken'.3 No matter how clinically
effective, PM presents an anthropological challenge. An unbroken enthusiasm around
PM augurs further transformations for medicine and the public healthcare system,
research agendas and clinical consultations.4 In some quarters a post-hype hangover has
also set in. Meanwhile, health service commissioners are expected to `deliver' to meet
growing patient expectations.5
In this article I argue that at least two fundamentally different notions of personhood
are at work in the public debate on PM which require discernment. The first centres on
patients' individuality, which PM promises to heed more than ever. However, if person-
hood is reduced to this, then the in-dividuum is effectively deeply divided, which
explains several unsavoury side-effects of present-day PM. This notion of the person is
in many ways a fiction, albeit a powerful one. In connection with PM it functions as a
lever, for example to further dismantle socialised healthcare and the fabric of solidarity
underlying it.6
Drawing on the work of John Zizioulas, Eberhard Jüngel and others, I then explore,
second, a theologically grounded existential phenomenology of personhood. Instead of
two divided substances, the person is in two distinct, but not divided, modes of being: the
biological and the trans-individual or social mode. The person is an intrinsically

ex-cessive being. One implication is that personhood only unfolds throughout time. This
entails the specific movement of medicine: as disease and death threaten to irreversibly
divide the person, the medical act aids the restoration of a person's always precarious
distinction-in-unity of the social and biological.
These two anthropologies imply a significant practical distinction: on the one hand an
enthusiastic, hyped, but ultimately fruitless PM--what I call `enthusiastic PM' (EPM)--
and on the other hand a sobered-up personalised medicine (SPM) that is both instrumen-
tal and effective. In order to introduce a way in which a sobered-up PM can work, I
operationalise the ethics of war as a set of criteria for interpreting and incorporating PM
into a regular medical practice adequate for persons.
Enthusiastic Personalised Medicine (EPM)
What Ingrid Slade calls the `advocacy-based' understanding of PM brings together sev-
eral strands of thought: the idea that persons are individuals, biological substances, and
the result of their genetic make-up. This understanding has a long, complicated trajec-
tory, which can only partly be sketched out here.
A Substantivist, Individualist Notion of the Person
The person as an ontological individual goes as far back as Boethius' sixth-century
reflection on the person of Christ: persona est naturae rationalis individua substantia--
the person is an individual (metaphysical) substance with a rational nature, i.e. a `self-
standing singularity'. `With this',Adrian Holderegger highlights, `the person is no longer
defined by an act of being, which could be described as free, rational, or conscious, but
rather by nature alone, whose specificum is then that it is also rational'.7
Besides this substantivist background, the Cartesian turn towards subjectivity was a
key moment. For Descartes, the self was given in the mode of reflection as such; the
thinking and the existing human being became identical. `With this, the re-connection of
the person to constitutive elements such as reason, individuality, and relation becomes
more difficult and intransparent. Here the "person" is no more than a bracket between
body and mind. Mind and body are distinct substances. They constitute a functioning
unit which is guaranteed by the person'.8 Cartesian mechanistic physiology, popular well
into the nineteenth century, could merge well with John Locke's person as `self-con-
scious, rational human being'.9 For Locke, there was no longer a need for metaphysical

substance; his `substance' was empirical matter. The underpinnings of modern medicine
and evolutionary theory lean heavily on these traditions, relying on their biological,
material(ist) sides. Most medical ethics textbooks today refer to J. S. Mill as a champion
of individuals' autonomous consent and, based on self-ownership, their freedom from
unwanted, paternalistic intervention.
However, genomic medicine developed out of molecular biology, in vicinity to
scientists seeking purely physical-chemical answers to humanity's `big questions'.
From the 1950s onwards the quest for DNA coincided with a cultural fascination for
science fiction, not least under the dark cloud of nuclear threat. Outer space and the
genome established the `new frontiers' of humanity's (self-)conquest.10 As an indus-
try, biotech took off in the late 1970s with the growth of venture capitalism driven by
the increased value of marketable information. The era heralded the triumph of the
entrepreneurial homo economicus, the hero of material maximisation, control and
pragmatic self-management. The rise of the well-informed, consumer-patient coin-
cided with this.11
The `inward discovery'12 of humanity was eventually said to culminate in the genome.
In the last instance, our DNA was to be the `hidden ruler of life' that makes us who we
are.13 More recently, epigenetics have extended and complicated this field of knowl-
edge.14 The Human Genome Project (HGP) may not have yielded the `revolutionary'15
results it promised, but public and business investment in PM continues. Personalisation,
prediction, prevention and participation (4P) are to replace `reactive medicine' as we
know it with `health maintenance'.16 Critique is seen as suspicious: anti-progressive and
Luddite, it jeopardises Western countries' prospects in the global economic race.

The Unhappy Dialectics of the Molecular Individual
The notion of `person' emerging in this what one might call enthusiastic personalised
medicine (EPM) is marked and haunted by a particular, problematic logic: the in-divid-
ual is deeply divided, to the point even of internal contradiction.
The first division or dualism consists in the reduction of personhood to molecular-
biological terms. Not the phenotypical person--the sick patient who, up until now, was
supposedly always given a `one-size-fits-all' treatment--but the altered genotype is the
truly unique person here. A `holistic' approach in this context has to extend the substan-
tivist individual: complete knowledge of the person means more `omic' data. This
descriptive reduction sharply divides from other forms of personal encounter. In this
sense, PM is not substantially different from, but a specific continuation of, biology-
oriented medicine as a whole. It `perpetuates a structural plane of immanence, which is
but an identical repetition of the same. Biology must reduce that which it describes to
nothing, that is, nothing outside its descriptive abilities (DNA, etc.). This is the "text"
which biology is, and this text has nothing outside it...'.17 In other words, the complete
`literation'of life into codes and elements, the ancient stoicheia, simultaneously ob-liter-
ates life.18 Quite in this spirit, molecular medicine is believed to `transform ... everyday
clinical practice from an empirical art to a rational ortho-molecular science'.19
This reduction of the person to a merely molecular object has been frequently criticised. For
example, Thomas Wabel noted the purely rational, autonomous coping strategies furthered by
PM: the identification and analysis of diseases, the search for alternatives, and finally disease
management and control. However, `in these strategies--indispensable as they are--the body,
the physical condition for existence, becomes the object of analysis and action'. And: `To
regard my body as the object of medical treatment, means to distance myself from the body
(Körper) I have'.20 Regarding predictive medicine, Christiane Woopen has similarly noted:
`For the human being, his own body increasingly becomes an objectified entity, which he no
longer feels primarily to be an "I" in the sense of a unity of body and soul, but an "It" he has
examined and treated'.21 Overmedicalisation and overtreatment is the most overt result.

This first dualism engenders a second dualism, a contradictory oscillation one might
call the `bad dialectics of EPM'. Here, even the Cartesian dualism championed by bio-
medical individualism is instable, because the material body as a mere `thing' and the
autonomous will cancel each other out.As our genome is oddly everywhere and nowhere,
the body dissolves into data packages, or `network nodes', beyond the confines of its
physical boundaries--and control.22 Interacting with `risk factors' between health and
disease, the discursively objectified body then gains a new eerie, life-determining
agency, undermining the very Cartesian inertness of the object: the `exposome' or other
`omes' constantly redefine and extend the individual. As Conor Cunningham put it: `The
"cancer" of my body is a world unto itself. My leg becomes apart from me, it grows as it
re-narrates my body, in a manner of which Kafka would be proud. Our bodies come apart
as knowledge rips them asunder, even though it may keep them intact.'23 In this context
Woopen worries about overmedicalisation: `More and more tests are done, more and
more diseases are feared, the worries about health take on a growing space in people's
consciousness, in their responsibility and lifestyle.'24 Here, a new genomics-based life-
style industry looms at the horizon--including vast opportunities for quackery.
But just as EPM's notion of the body oscillates between the biological object and a
threatening presence of (non-)disease or lifestyle-idol, so its autonomous (consumer-)will
and Foucauldian `technologies of the self' paradoxically imply a new, subtle paternalism.
Based on genetic prediction, EPM promises to enable patients to `actively own ... their
healthcare decisions'.25 More health data suggest more autonomy, (auto-)biographical con-
trol, better informed consent, effectively a `fully permissive medicine'ultimately guided by
personal preference.26 As the DNAsequence appears to chart out a particular life-course, the
person can leap ahead and retrospectively manage the present, adjusting their life according
to genetic or other `-omic'parameters. Increased autonomy implies a self-abstraction prede-
termined by genetic diagnosis. The patient internalises the principle of private insurance.
But this autonomy immediately collapses into paternalist control and technological
(self-)infantilisation, equipped with nudges, monitoring gadgets and apps.27 An increased
responsibilisation grounded in information-based autonomy implies intensified preven-
tive compliance-regimes.

Everyday Life (New York: Peter Lang, 2010), pp. 113­26. NB: Levina regards the dissolution
of the (Foucauldian) individual into exchanging data packages as an affirmation of social
personhood. See Richard Tutton, Genomics and the Reimagining of Personalized Medicine
(New York and London: Routledge, 2016), p. 163. On the ethical `dividuum' see already
Friedrich Nietzsche, Menschliches, Allzu Menschliches, §57.
33. Cunningham, Genealogy of Nihilism, p. xii.
The more we know about predispositions through genetic testing, the more our health and our
diseases will seem to be results, products of our own actions, indeed products of our own will
... In return, the person who is ill, will be confronted with the underlying question of why they
became ill and, if not genetically advised, whether they could not have prevented the outbreak
of the disease by taking a predictive genetic test. In this way, becoming ill will be moved into
the personal responsibility of the patient.28
This is particularly attractive to private insurance companies. Equipped with financial
`soft' power, they may more intrusively mandate less cost-intensive lifestyles.29
Looking at empirical research, Wabel noted a `dialectics of autonomy' also with
regards to the doctor­patient relationship: `On the one hand, all additional informa-
tion is helpful for making a rational choice in a situation of incomplete information,
thereby increasing autonomy. On the other hand, interview studies have shown that,
for some patients, the possibility to choose is a burden rather than a benefit'.30 As
disease becomes more abstract and clinical specialisations once again fragment, cli-
nicians' depth of control effectively increases. Yet they are depersonalised too, hand-
ing over patients from specialist to specialist in a minutely differentiated healthcare
industry.31
In short: the `enthusiastic' version of Personalised Medicine appeals to and intensi-
fies the substantivist, reductionist anthropology in which the in-dividual is paradoxi-
cally marked by a logic of division: first, a division from a more than scientifically
reduced understanding of the person; second, divided and contradicting internally.32
In other words, in the most enthusiastic versions of PM, personhood first becomes an
impossibility, and then we unsuccessfully oscillate between its two Cartesian con-
stituents: our cherished autonomy, now the object of new regimes, and our body, no
longer the mere quiet functioning of the organs.33 Stable biological `thinghood' is an
optical illusion.

Two Ways Ahead: Further Reductionism, Mediate Paths
One next step has been to push molecular reductionism to its conclusion. As con-
sciousness is increasingly mapped onto the brain, some neuro-philosophers have sug-
gested `personhood' itself is a fiction.34 But if there are no persons, everything can be
a person, such as objects endowed with artificial intelligence. Business models con-
necting PM with the Internet of Things point in this direction.35 The moral imperative
is to successfully enhance biological biographies as part of an overall evolutionary
narrative of humanity, a species within an overall networked flux of data.36 What
looms is a kind of post-patienthood for health `customers' and `service-users'. But
more `personal characteristics' in the form of data harbour less compassionate care on
the whole. Why not withdraw care from someone who has been negligent, despite
known genetic risk factors? With disease turning into a matter of moral judgment, the
dark underbelly of EPM's autonomous individual is the hospital reject, the `human
trash' who deserves it.37
The divided logic of EPM's notion of the patient has also been countered by insisting
on a `mind­body unity'.38 But if transcendental agnosticism merely acknowledges that
there is a unity of soul and body, such insistence remains an inconsequential admonition,
especially in the absence of a definition of `soul'. Nonetheless, if we look at recent devel-
opments in theological anthropology, personhood as more than a vague individual mind-
body unity has considerable consequences. If biology--and specifically genomic
medicine--is sublated into this logic of personhood, it can be understood and embraced
as an improved tool.

The Ontology of Personhood
Of course, the dialectics of the genomic individual may be all there is. This is the stance
of the joyful homo geneticus in glossy prospectuses. But a significant amount of anxiety
lurks in this vision: the frightening, abysmal option of death, which is a mere (or sheer)
abyssos, and the social stigma associated with disease, now a negligent lapse of mainte-
nance. Unsurprisingly, the genomics and big-data hype cannot grasp these anxieties.
Personhood--Advent, Presence
To point at this abyss or indeed any kind of true lack in molecular-biological discourse is
already to make it merely an option. Heeding this abyss is to already move beyond it, the
door through which personhood (re-)enters. It is to acknowledge in human persons `an
excessive moment that breaks free of immanent description',39 though far from invalidat-
ing the immanent. Put differently, the deficiencies of the genomics hype are not addressed
by adding more data to the individual patient (for all we know, the Good Samaritan had
no patient record of the man by the road). It is rather by going beyond the reductionist
biomedical stoicheia, into the abyss of death, suffering, failure, the hospital reject, the
supposedly `deserving'sick. It is to integrate such horrific non-existence into healthcare,
though not by merely `managing' it. This breaking-through of a being's excessiveness is
a moment of advent, the recognition of that which is outside in the middle of life, so that
the middle can truly become itself.40 On this assumption a reflection on humans as the
imagines Dei becomes intelligible in the first place: human personhood through Christ's
human­divine personhood (through weakness and death risen to eternal life).41 In other
words, there is a `temporal infinitude', an intrinsic ex-cessiveness to the physical human
that questions them as mere information, even if that is very precious information.
With reference to historical theology John D. Zizioulas has influentially described such a
pre-Boethian understanding of personhood.42 As theologians were debating the Incarnation
in the fourth century, the term hypostasis (mode of being) ceased to denote `substance' and
became synonymous with `person'. Personhood came to be regarded as the foundation of
being as such. It was no longer the fleeting attribute of an individual substance.43

Theological Perspectives in Medical Ethics, 3rd edn (Grand Rapids, MI and Cambridge:
Eerdmans, 2012), pp. 377­78. Hauerwas problematically erodes the person, who for him is
either an individual or amalgamated into the ekklesia.
Personhood, Zizioulas explains, signifies not an individual bounded singularity, but
the `openness of being', even `the ek-stasis of being'. Personhood is a `movement
towards communion which leads to a transcendence of the boundaries of the self and
thus to freedom'.44 Significantly, `the person in its ekstatic character reveals its being in
a catholic, i.e. integral and undivided [!], way, and thus in its being ekstatic it becomes
... the bearer of its nature in its totality'.45 Persons are, and are `global' and truly them-
selves in unbounded, free relations of love. This does not imply a collectivist eradication
of the individual. Quite the contrary: personal ek-stasis is partly constitutive of meaning-
ful particularity and autonomy. In the final analysis, Zizioulas emphasises, that which
`makes a particular personal being be itself--and thus be at all--is ... communion, free-
dom and love'.46 Effectively, for Zizioulas, the fourth century replaced the ontology of
substance with an `ontology of love'.
For Zizioulas, true personhood as a particular individual can only be achieved by
God, who is love, but whose particularity is established as the one person Incarnate in
Christ. In other words: God is a particular being `not by virtue of its boundaries (he is
"incomprehensible", "indivisible" etc.), but by its ekstasis of communion (he is eternally
Trinity and love) which makes it unique and indispensable'.47 Precisely in this way
humans strive to become the imago Dei: to achieve full ekstasis, for `all to be in all'. This
striving forms the desire not only for seemingly `autonomous' mastery, but also the sus-
ceptibility to all kinds of hype. The intrinsically excessive notion of human personhood
starkly contrasts with the primary dualism of EPM's joyful Deleuzian reductionism. The
actual presence of persons challenges a hermetically sealed biomedical discourse, with-
out merely tick-boxing a `mind­body' unity.
Personhood--Absence
Notably, the excessiveness of personhood does not tear asunder again the relational per-
son and the material body. This conclusion is a recurrent problem in writings that conflate
medicine with pastoral, (church-)community care in an attempt to counter the alienating
coldness of modern, industrialised medicine.48 Rather than consisting again of two sepa-
rate spheres or substances, the human person persists in two distinct yet inseparable
modes: what Zizioulas calls the `ecclesial mode' (i.e. the trans-individual, relational) and
the biological mode. Persons are always as born, embodied individuals. In the biological

to a pathologist, and medicine to autopsy. For Jeffrey P. Bishop, adapting Foucault, this is
inevitably the case in modern medicine. See The Anticipatory Corpse: Medicine, Power, and
the Care of the Dying (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2011), p. 55, 279­

mode of existence they are subject to disintegration, that is, final division. Death and dis-
ease are the ultimate threat to communion, freedom and love. The cadaver, the human
corpse is the only `thing' remaining, the true `individual'.49 Conversely, just because it
attends to the person's biological mode, molecular medicine is not per se reductionist.
Personhood thus equally depends on a paradox, albeit one of presence and absence.
The person's catholicity or globality in relations of love may suggest transparent pleni-
tude. But in reality there is of course also a hiddenness to persons that defies all surveil-
lance, which is the result of patients'and observers'own limited bodies. To use a different
analogy: `The very fact of religions, cults, temples and rituals shows that the gods are not
present. For if they were we would live in cities without temples and churches as the seer
of the revelation of John described the heavenly Jerusalem'.50 This absence­presence is
not least hinted at in Paul (1 Cor. 13:12): `For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we
will see face to face'--whereby prosopon (face) signified person. The full realisation of
personal presence (both human and divine) remains an eschatological problem.
The simultaneous ecstatic relationality and inaccessibility of persons resonate with
experience. It is impossible to `sum up'a person, for example after death. The person `is'
in unrepeatable connections to others, who can only share their memories.51 What a per-
son is for themselves remains opaque, to an extent also for themselves. Their true `sum'
would be all their relationships in the past, present and future, including the relationships
of those too. This would require a kind of omniscience, but would result in no more than
judgment. From this perspective, the aim of a truly `holistic' medicine raises grave con-
cerns. Beyond logistic limits, it suggests either a reduced or a totalitarian understanding
of the whole.52
At the same time, if one takes relationality-in-communion seriously, it becomes clear
why Orthodox traditions could see each person as a theophany-in-humanity and corpo-
rate identity. Each person could be Christ (theosis); each relation of love the Church as a
whole.53
Personhood in Time--Becoming
The logic of presence­absence introduces what I would call a dramatic amplitude into
personhood. Encountering persons is to recognise them as infinitely more than

proves to be a neighbour (and person) by seriously attending to manifesting appearances.

55. Beyond the metaphorical, a theological-systematic transferability between different `topical'
or `applied' ethics may point to Rom. 12:1-8, or 1 Cor. 12:4-6. On the false enthusiasm (!)

Fortress Press, 1994).

individuals, and simultaneously much less, as radically unavailable. Individuals can be
confined and as data packages handled like dispensable bulk goods (despite their unique
DNA); such reduction or dissolution is hardly possible for persons. Moreover, dramatic
amplitude captures personhood as something emerging (e-venire). In being `advents',
persons--again Christ-analogously--are also events, hence more significant than a mere
occurrence or incidence. As health is lost and regained throughout life-time, humans are
always becoming persons, social `mind­body unities'.54 In other words: the dramatic
amplitude of persons as `much more' and `much less' unfolding through and becoming
in time happens before a horizon of reconciliation, or personhood (re-)gained.
Sobering up Personalised Medicine
Quite undramatically, this dramatic amplitude of the person provides the very logic that
sobers up personalised medicine. In challenging the primary dualism underlying bio-
medical reductionism, personhood unfolding throughout time readjusts the divided dia-
lectics of EPM.
At the same time, with the overarching theological meta-discourse of personal recon-
ciliation in mind, medical ethics may analogously `poach' in the fields of the ethics of
war.55 If politics can be thought before the horizon of an ontological peace that over-
comes political division, then the medical/caring act analogously seeks to affect physical
health with faith in an ontological health which overcomes contemporary Cartesian divi-
sions of substance.56 This is not least sustained by Christian metaphors: God as the ulti-
mate physician, the Christus medicus, and the Prince of Peace. They meet in the holicity
of shalom (wholeness, health or peace). Diseases such as cancer are often metaphorically
described as `enemies'to `battle', and some therapies akin to `nuclear options'. Preventive
interventions are possible as much as genetic surveillance. Just like drones, treatments
can `precision-target' malign tissues or invasive microorganisms. As in politics, the dan-
ger is to fall into absolute dualism, a total enmity.57

Such a logic of reconciliation inherent in personhood has significant implications. First,

`reactive medicine' remains a pleonasm. As a scientific discipline of mending it wrestles
the person from `thinghood': it counters the division between mind and body to the point
of `betrayal' (e.g. in pain), but equally the division between persons as reduction-in-
suffering threatens the social fabric.58 A medicine adequate to persons aids the always
precarious, emerging coincidence of the biological and ecclesial modes of being.
Such a medicine certainly includes genomics, but significantly relocates and re-temporal-
ises it.59 As a result, EPM's dialectic may resolve into a sober hope. The service of healing as
real `patience-work' corresponds to it, and is not replaced by the `proactive maintenance of
health'.60 Notably, hype is the opposite of events arduously unfolding in time: it propounds
`Mission Accomplished' by virtue of sheer declaration. But like the war to end all wars, a
medicine to end all medicine denies the encounter with actual suffering. It denies human pas-
sibility. Christianity certainly regards death as the `last enemy' (1 Cor. 15:26). Hence EPM
appeals to the aversion against biological fatalism. But against all claims to scientific progress,
a denial at all costs may well be a counter-factual maintenance of a status quo, a Heraclitean
stasis--only to then regard death as a catastrophic failure of technology, again a sheer abyss.
Medical care faces rather than postpones that abyss in continuous, patient engagement.
Like persons themselves, a sobered-up PM (SPM) is much less and much more than
the hype suggests. No longer an ideology61 that offers a sufficient horizon for human
flourishing, SPM can simply function as another diagnostic and therapeutic instrument.
Those who have always seen PM in that way have rightly wondered why PM should
raise anthropological concerns at all, or even be a distinct sphere of research. However,
the narratives of advertised revolutions challenge institutionalised forms of medicine and
redefine terms such as `persons' or `care'. Expensive measures, where not direct-to-
consumer, are already heavily straining public healthcare budgets.62 Hence, a theologi-
cal-existential language of personhood remains a `stumbling block'.

ciple of PM resource allocation, rather than the welfarist principle of consumer preference

Fairly Allocating Scarce Health-Care Resources', pp. 211­30.
Authority--Emergent Recognition
Who decides? The question of authority concerns not just politics. As noted, EPM
champions the individual over against medical paternalism. However, as we saw,
personhood as free and social complicates that view. The middle ground between an
(industry-/insurance-driven) paternalism and consumer capriciousness must be
regained in concrete clinical encounters, the locus of PM as sober medical practice.
The concept of `embodied autonomy' is highly relevant here: `... to experience
myself as "I" within the world, presupposes feeling myself to be the body (Leib) I
am'.63 Moreover, if every person--to an extent--can be a theophany-in-humanity,
the `levelling' of authority between clinician and patient happens in personal encoun-
ters. The `act' of listening here is not so much the muting of one autonomous indi-
vidual (patient or clinician) whilst the other asserts their demands. Rather, witnessing
to reconciliation, in listening to the other, waiting to reach out in word, sign and
gesture, clinician and patient become persons. In responding to concrete manifesta-
tions with serious attention they allow for such an `autonomy' in free relationality to
emerge in the first place.64
Particularly as direct-to-consumer genetic tests are on the rise, clinicians find them-
selves in the position of having to give reassurance rather than interventions that
increase patients' alienation from their bodies (and thus also subvert clinicians' com-
passionate affections). Where digitalisation, big data, commercial interests and insur-
ance pressures already pre-define or even populate the clinical relationship, those
involved disintegrate: into individual bodies, resalable entities within networked `con-
trol societies' (Deleuze).
Moreover, since personhood is the continuous event of being-in-relation, a sobered-
up PM is intrinsically public, growing out of and operating within a public healthcare
system (and not just the church); it responds to physical suffering as a social division.65
SPM emerges from structures of welfare justice, not vice versa.66 This side-lines the
biotech industry and the homo economicus, and critically contextualises the current situ-
ation: commissioners are confronted with expensive innovations, but left alone with the
task of integrating them into public healthcare.

Discrimination--Discerning the Necessary
Discrimination means to intend to separate the innocent from the guilty; guilt is established
by the `direct material co-operation in the doing of wrong'.67 In medicine, `discrimination'
means to target the disease with the intention to heal in so far as disease and its effects as
illness and pain directly contribute to the division of the person. Considering that PM prom-
ises to reduce indiscriminate `one-size-fits-all' treatments, one might wonder why a lack of
discrimination should at all be a problem here. Treatments that replace `nuclear', `scorched-
earth'or ineffective interventions, i.e. a stratified medicine, surely can only be welcomed.
Based on the anthropological difference between EPM and SPM, a sharp demarcation
line runs between stratification and the lofty, predictive and preventive promises of
`4P'-medicine.68 Groundless testing introduces again an abysmal crack into the healthy
person, an alter ego or `sick personality', the (already diseased) `genetic person'. Once
total surveillance suggests total suspicion, the `one-size-fits-all' approach is repeated on
the individual level: the body becomes an indiscriminate battlefield; risks are reified and
treated where other responses may be indicated.69 The intention to mend the person-as-
patient, the proprium of medicine, gets lost here.
Presuming the healthy integrity of persons, no matter how precarious, mandates
genetic surveillance only where there are clinical reasons to believe a disease will become
manifest as illness--i.e. as concrete persons emerge and endure throughout time.70 Again
a political parallel: a government may gather comprehensive intelligence in order to
target a foreign dictator. But first they need to have an indication that that dictator is the
enemy, not anyone or everyone else. By the same token, it may be adequate, even manda-
tory, to withhold medical treatment merely based on someone's genetic risk factors. On
the surface that may well violate `patient autonomy'.
Conversely, failing to make use of PM where possible is also indiscriminate.
Arguments that PM should be available merely because it is `innovative' or (still) part of
an EU-framework miss this point. The fact that some tests, for example for BRCA muta-
tions, are not as widely available as they could be, and the distinct possibility that PM is
only for the wealthy may be examples of, respectively, random and elitist discrimination.
Particularly if coupled with an embrace of suffering (preferably other people's) in the

name of a Christianity that Nietzsche chided so well, compassion for those excluded by
EPM is turned on its head. These possibilities are the result of a lack of discrimination,
the molecular targeting of diseases that affect persons as social-communal beings.
Proportionality--Doing What's Feasible
If discriminate clinical judgment can be seen as a matter of intention, then proportional-
ity `has to do with the rational form which such an act assumes, i.e. with the successful
act of judgment', O'Donovan writes on the use of force.71 Analogously, medical inter-
ventions need to be adequate to the aim they can realistically achieve.
Proportionality has a retrospective and a prospective aspect. First, the retrospection:
Hugo Grotius--one of the first proponents of a public healthcare system--suggested that
only an iniuria accepta, a received injury, warrants response. Mere suspicion or `risk'
does not warrant an intervention (in Grotius' case: military), because it is always costly.
Preventive `invasion', the treatment of a pre-disease `risk state' as if it was a disease, is
flat-out disproportionate. At least Grotius thus expressed allowance for contingency:
`For protection against uncertain fears we must rely on divine providence and on a wari-
ness free of reproach, not on force.'72 Not only does that entail that a need for flexible
responses, but also what O'Donovan calls a `descriptive responsibility: ... what is under-
taken must correspond to what is purposed, and what is purposed must correspond to
what is reasonably complained of'.73 Nonetheless, the iniuria accepta by no means needs
to be an iniuria perfecta.74 Reactive medicine need not be literally reactive. The risk of a
person's disease can amount to inevitability, so that supportive intervention is pre-emp-
tive rather than preventive.
But another possible retrospective (dis-)proportion relates to this: funding prestigious,
expensive research at the expense of offering affordable conventional therapies, suffi-
cient medical and caring staff.75 What good is the best targeted therapy, if patients on the
ward are treated like `numbers in a concentration camp', as a nurse complained at a
Royal Society of Medicine (RSM) meeting in 2015? The `revolution' of PM thus may
well be a crisis one shouldn't let go to waste. Instead of merely re-moralising healthcare
professionals, sobering-up PM implies re-proportioning existing organisational struc-
tures and funds towards the effective and necessary care for persons. The present analy-
sis thus well connects to some central concerns of social medicine.
Second, what is the aim of a medical intervention in concreto? If the end of a political
act is a concrete peace settlement, the end of a medical act is the patient's health as rea-
sonably achievable. In politics, forward-looking disproportion may creep in when mili-
tary victory becomes the aim, rather than a possible mere means by which to achieve a

concrete peace settlement.76 Analogously, biotechnological triumph can become an end
in itself--especially so when research and development is tied to the imperative of eco-
nomic growth in the midst of post-industrial decline. The ancient apocalyptic forces of
death versus God here are replaced by the late-modern struggle of man versus machine.
Patient and disease are conflated in an antagonistic, dualistic battle against death which
no one can win. Transhumanism is one way to reconcile the opposites, a latter-day incar-
nation of machine into man. But pace some theologians, this is more of a parody of the
Incarnation rather than a genuine correspondence (Entsprechung).77
Forward-looking proportion means measuring the risk of failure and benefit. It is the
task of proportioning an action in relation to its end. What is a reasonable end, for exam-
ple in terminal cancer? Are invasive, cost-intensive interventions with a small chance of
two additional weeks of life `appropriate'? `Proportion is, indeed, always the decisive
argument in bringing conflict to an end',78 either because everything is lost--or won. In
determining medical ends and proportionate means, both implications of EPM are again
to be avoided: the Charybdis of death-denying wellbeing, and the Scylla of prematurely
abandoning patients. Especially this last will become an issue with further resource con-
straints on healthcare budgets. Not all of them are `natural': they imply theological-
medical anthropologies, too.
Conclusion
Personalised Medicine is a set of technologies promising early diagnosis, molecular
stratification and precision-medicines. The `person' and a deep concern for individuals
are invoked by PM enthusiasts and sober pragmatists alike. However, beyond the sto-
icheia of biomedical reduction, Foucauldian technologies of the self, and a dissolution of
the human into data packages, persons are ontologically and epistemologically exces-
sive, even as they are unique. Emerging throughout time, persons are geared towards a
holistic integrity of shalom that escapes analysis. In line with such an ontological logic
of reconciliation, personhood is the standard by which helpful uses of PM can be dis-
cerned from hype, unrealistic expectations and quackery. If geared towards persons, PM
technologies can be part of medicine as patience-work. Such discernment need not rein-
vent the wheel, but can learn from other fields of applied ethics.
