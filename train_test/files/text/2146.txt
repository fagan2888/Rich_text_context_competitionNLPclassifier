Abstract
Background: Treatment of chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is complicated
by the presence of comorbidities. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the prevalence of comorbidity in
COPD using nationally-representative data.
Methods: This study draws from a multi-year analytic sample of 14,828 subjects aged 45+, including 995 with
COPD, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999­2008. COPD was defined by
self-reported physician diagnosis of chronic bronchitis or emphysema; patients who reported a diagnosis of asthma
were excluded. Using population weights, we estimated the age-and-gender-stratified prevalence of 22 comorbid
conditions that may influence COPD and its treatment.
Results: Subjects 45+ with physician-diagnosed COPD were more likely than subjects without physician-diagnosed
COPD to have coexisting arthritis (54.6% vs. 36.9%), depression (20.6% vs. 12.5%), osteoporosis (16.9% vs. 8.5%),
cancer (16.5% vs. 9.9%), coronary heart disease (12.7% vs. 6.1%), congestive heart failure (12.1% vs. 3.9%), and stroke
(8.9% vs. 4.6%). Subjects with COPD were also more likely to report mobility difficulty (55.6% vs. 32.5%), use of >4
prescription medications (51.8% vs. 32.1), dizziness/balance problems (41.1% vs. 23.8%), urinary incontinence (34.9%
vs. 27.3%), memory problems (18.5% vs. 8.8%), low glomerular filtration rate (16.2% vs. 10.5%), and visual impairment
(14.0% vs. 9.6%). All reported comparisons have p < 0.05.
Conclusions: Our study indicates that COPD management may need to take into account a complex spectrum of
comorbidities. This work identifies which conditions are most common in a nationally-representative set of COPD
patients (physician-diagnosed), a necessary step for setting research priorities and developing clinical practice
guidelines that address COPD within the context of comorbidity.
Background
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the
4th most common cause of death in the United States,
with projections that it will move into 3rd place by 2020.
Currently, COPD is the attributable cause of death for
more than 120,000 deaths per year. While deaths from
stroke and heart disease decreased between 1970 and
2002, death rates for COPD nearly doubled [1]. COPD is
also a leading cause of hospitalizations in older adults
[2], as well as of other morbidity.
COPD does not simply contribute to mortality. It may
contribute substantially to difficulties with activities of
daily living and disrupt social functioning [3]. A study in
2003, for example, found the presence of either moder-
ate or severe COPD to be associated with a higher odds
ratio of functional limitations [4].
The majority of patients with COPD have more than
just COPD - comorbidities in COPD are the rule, ra-
ther than the exception. A study of 200 COPD patients
from a managed care organization, for example, found
that 94% of patients had at least one other chronic

medical condition [5]. This is significant because
comorbidities in COPD are associated with poorer out-
comes, both for COPD and the other conditions [6,7].
Previous studies have shown an association between a
variety of chronic conditions and COPD, including
hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery
disease, and malignancy [6-9].
Previous studies on comorbidities in COPD have typ-
ically focused on selected chronic medical conditions,
such as heart failure and diabetes. These studies have
largely failed to look comprehensively at many other
high-priority conditions, such as arthritis and obesity,
and important functional limitations, like cognitive im-
pairment and limited mobility. Functional limitations
can have a significant impact on the treatment of
chronic conditions, as patients may have difficulty ad-
hering to treatment regimens [10]. These conditions
may also modify the effectiveness of COPD therapy,
cause potentially dangerous therapeutic interactions, and
make COPD therapies less feasible.
Despite these potential interactions and the complex-
ities of clinical decision-making for people with COPD,
little population­based data on the prevalence of comor-
bidities in COPD is available. To date, there have been
no nationally-representative studies of the prevalence of
comorbidities in COPD. Moreover, COPD clinical prac-
tice guidelines do not provide specific recommendations
for older patients with multiple comorbid diseases [11].
Thus, in this study, we aim to describe the prevalence of
clinically-relevant comorbid conditions that add to the
complexity of clinical decision-making or self-
management of COPD in a nationally-representative
population of people with physician-diagnosed COPD.
We also compare these prevalence estimates to those
seen in subjects without COPD, to gain a better under-
standing of which conditions in particular are more
common in people with COPD.
Methods
Study population
NHANES is a nationally-representative study designed
to assess the health and nutritional status of non-
institutionalized civilians in the US. Collection of infor-
mation occurs through home interviews and exams in
mobile centers. Study details, including operations man-
uals, are publicly available [12]. To ensure adequate
sample size in age and gender strata, we joined five sur-
vey waves (1999­2000, 2001­2002, 2003­2004, 2005­
2006, and 2007­2008). This created an analytic sample
of 14,828 people age 45 and older, including 995 with
COPD. Using the sampling weights described below,
this sample represents around 100 million people, 10
million of whom have COPD. From 1999­2008, the
NHANES interview response rates ranged from 78% to
84%. Of those interviewed, 75% to 80% completed the
physical exam.
Definition of conditions
COPD and comorbid disease status were ascertained
largely through NHANES questions asking "has a doctor
or other health professional ever told you that you have
[disease]?" Physician-diagnosed COPD was defined as a
positive response to either chronic bronchitis or emphy-
sema with a negative response to current asthma. Sub-
jects were defined as having a history of smoking if they
reported having smoked >100 cigarettes total in their
life.
Coronary heart disease (CHD) was defined by an af-
firmative response to at least one of CHD, angina, or
heart attack. For diabetes (DM), subjects were able to re-
port prediabetes (2007­2008) or borderline diabetes
(1999­2008). Among those reporting either prediabetes
or borderline diabetes, individuals were counted as hav-
ing DM if they took insulin or a pill for diabetes, suf-
fered from retinopathy, and for 1999­2004, if they had a
lower extremity ulcer that took more than 4 weeks to
heal, or had numbness or tingling in their hands or feet
due to diabetes.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using
the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equa-
tion based on serum creatinine, age, race, and gender.
Low GFR was defined as an estimated GFR < 60 mm/L
[13]. Low hemoglobin was defined as <12 g/dL in
women and < 13 g/dL in men [13]. Urinary incontinence
was ascertained by self-report of leaking urine at least a
few times a month. Polypharmacy was defined as self-
reported regular use of >4 prescription medications, fol-
lowing a previously established cut point [13]. Prescrip-
tion dietary supplements were not counted as
medications. For 1999­2000, prescription analgesics
used on a chronic basis were not included in the count.
Prescription analgesics were included in the drug count
from 2001­2008.
Hypertension (HTN) was defined as mean systolic
blood pressure 140 mmHg on exam, mean diastolic
blood pressure  90 mmHg, and/or current use of an
antihypertensive [9,14]. The mean blood pressures were
calculated following NHANES protocol [12]. If there
was more than one reading, the first reading was
excluded from the mean; otherwise, the sole reading was
considered the "mean." Hypercholesterolemia was simi-
larly defined by a total serum cholesterol >6.21 mmol/L
or current use of a hyperlipidemia drug. Depression and
anxiety were defined as self-reported current use of an
antidepressant or anxiolytic, respectively.
Memory problems were defined as an affirmative re-
sponse or "don't know" to the question "are you limited
in any way because of difficulty remembering or because

you experience periods of confusion?" Mobility difficulty
was considered present if the individual reported diffi-
culty walking 0.25 miles or up to 10 steps without equip-
ment. Visual impairment was ascertained through self-
reported extreme difficulty reading newsprint or seeing
up close, or, an examined visual acuity score of <20/50
in the better eye. Hearing impairment was defined
according to self-report of "a lot" of trouble hearing or
use of a hearing aid.
Individuals who reported dizziness or imbalance last-
ing at least 2 weeks or for an unknown duration, or, dif-
ficulty with balance in the last year, were counted as
having problems with dizziness or balance. This variable
was only available from 1999­2004; we present the
prevalence only for the population from 1999­2004. A
history of cancer was defined by self-report of having
been diagnosed with cancer, excluding non-melanoma
and unknown skin cancers. Subjects were considered
obese if their body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m2.
Frailty was defined according to four of the five cri-
teria developed in the Cardiovascular Health Study [15]
and Women's Health and Aging Studies [16], modified
for NHANES [17]. Subjects from survey years 1999­
2006 were defined as "frail" if they had 3 of the four
following characteristics: low BMI, weakness, exhaus-
tion, and low physical activity. Low BMI was defined as
a BMI  18.5 kg/m2. Weakness was defined as a re-
sponse of "some difficulty," "much difficulty," or "unable
to do" when asked how difficult they find it to lift 10
pounds. Exhaustion was defined using these same
responses when asked how difficult they find it to walk
from one room to another on the same level. Low phys-
ical activity was defined as reporting less activity than
other people of the same age. Physical activity relative to
others of the same age was not assessed in 2007­2008.
Therefore, subjects from 2007­2008 were considered
frail if they had a low BMI and reported both weakness
and exhaustion.
Condition groupings
We grouped the conditions into three domains ­ dis-
eases, clinical factors, and health status factors. As out-
lined in Boyd et al., the disease domain encompasses
traditional chronic diseases that are considered of major
importance because they are established as leading
causes of death or morbidity [13]. The clinical domain
consists of physiological conditions and factors that
should be weighed when prescribing therapies (e.g.,
polypharmacy). The health status domain was reserved
for conditions that affect function and quality of life,
are likely to affect a person's ability to adhere to ther-
apy, and are often caused by several processes in older
adults [13].
Analytic plan
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) pro-
vides sampling weights that account for sampling strat-
egy and survey non-response. Using methods provided
by NCHS, we modified the original weights in our com-
bined sample to maintain national representation [18].
We performed analyses with statistical software designed
to conduct subpopulation analyses using masked vari-
ance units to estimate appropriate standard errors. We
summarize baseline characteristics using means and 95%
confidence intervals. Differences in these variables be-
tween subjects with and without COPD were compared
using a 2 test.
We ran the analysis stratified by age group. The ana-
lyses were rerun in the subset of COPD subjects with a
history of smoking to test the sensitivity of the COPD
definition. To address multiple testing, we reported both
the STATA-generated p-value and a Bonferroni-
corrected significance level () [19].
All analyses were carried out in STATA version 11.1.
The study protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine Institutional Review
Board.
Results
The prevalence of comorbid chronic disease among sub-
jects with physician-diagnosed COPD was: congestive heart
failure (12.1%), coronary heart disease (12.7%),hypertension
(60.4%), hypercholesterolemia (47.6%), stroke (8.9%),
diabetes (16.3%), osteoporosis (16.9%), arthritis (54.6%),
cancer (16.5%), depression (20.6%), and anxiety (8.6%).
Clinical factors potentially complicating the treatment
of COPD were: dizziness or balance problems (41.1%),
obesity (40.3%), urinary incontinence (34.9%), anemia
(9.3%), low GFR (16.2%), use of >4 prescription medica-
tions (51.8%), and frailty (9.5%). Subjects with COPD
were also found to have the following "health status"
factors: memory problems (18.5%), mobility difficulty
(55.6%), hearing impairment (12.1%), and visual impair-
ment (14.0%). 96.4% of subjects with COPD had at
leastone comorbidity.
Table 1 describes the basic demographic features of
those with and without COPD. Those with COPD
tended to be older and female.
Figures 1, 2 and 3 depict the prevalence rates of condi-
tions in the three domains (diseases, clinical factors, and
health status factors) in subjects with COPD. These fig-
ures provide a visual illustration of the high prevalence of
comorbidities in patients with physician-diagnosed
COPD; they do not statistically compare groups. The ma-
jority of the conditions are markedly more common in
the 65 age group than in the younger age groups. While
some conditions are more common in one gender than
the other (depression, CHD, osteoporosis, and hearing

impairment), others, such as polypharmacy, obesity, diz-
ziness or balance problems, and memory problems are
equally common among the two genders. Missing bars
on the graph represent conditions for which the sample
size was small in a given gender and age group.
Table 2 compares the prevalence rates of the condi-
tions in subjects with COPD to those without COPD.
Most of the conditions are significantly more prevalent
in the subjects with COPD than in the subjects without
COPD. While not shown in the table, some portion of
these differences can be accounted for by differences in
age and gender distribution in the COPD and non-
COPD groups. While not shown here, we found little dif-
ference in the prevalence of comorbid conditions
between COPD subjects with and without a history of
smoking,
Table 3 compares the prevalence of conditions in sub-
jects with COPD to those prevalence values found in pre-
vious publications. The table also notes the country of
study, the sample size, and the sampling method. We
found that, in most cases, the population-based preva-
lence of comorbid conditions is at least as high, if not
higher, as the prevalence found in these less-generalizable
COPD populations.
Discussion
In this paper, we describe the prevalence of clinically-
relevantcomorbidconditionsinanationally-representative
sample of people with physician-diagnosed COPD. We
found that 96.4% of adults with physician-diagnosed
COPD have at least one condition that may complicate
the treatment of COPD. Most notably, 51.8% of people
with COPD 45 and older are taking more than 4 medi-
cations (polypharmacy), 55.6% report mobility difficulty,
60.4% have hypertension, and 54.6% have arthritis.
These prevalence values are relatively consistent with
those found in previous studies of comorbidities in COPD.
However, there is a large range of previously reported
prevalence values. For example, estimates of arthritis in
COPD range from 22% [5] to 70% [23]. Neither of these
studies, nor any other recent studies investigating comor-
bidity in COPD, have examined nationally-representative
data. This both limits the applicability of these prevalence
estimates and helps account for the large ranges in
these estimates. In fact, several papers have cited lack
of national representation or specific population bias as
a weakness [5,8,24]. As such, our study both confirms
the high prevalence of comorbidities in patients with

COPD and provides specific prevalence values that are
relevant on a national scale.
Another strength of our study is the range of
clinically-relevant conditions assessed. While there is a
lot of data on, for example, cardiovascular disease in
COPD [8], there are few studies that look at the wide
variety of medical conditions and functional limitations
we have assessed. This is important partially because
comorbidity has been found to be an important aspect
of quality of life in COPD [25-27], as well as an inde-
pendent risk factor for hospitalization [28]. In addition,
comorbidities increase the risk of hospitalization and
mortality in patients with COPD [8], and significantly in-
crease the costs of treating COPD [29]. These conditions
are also highly relevant for clinical decision-making and
self-management.
The classification of the conditions into disease, clin-
ical factor, and health status factor domains highlights
that a wide range of conditions relevant to the clinical
management of people with COPD are quite prevalent,
and that these relevant conditions extend beyond
traditionally-defined diseases.
Physicians must be judicious when caring for patients
with COPD. The high prevalence of comorbidity and
polypharmacy means physicians must be cognizant of
potential adverse drug events and nonadherence. People
with COPD are often complex, and, thus, we will need
to improve our ability to prioritize treatment recommen-
dations based on relative benefits and harms and patient
preferences. Current guidelines, and our evidence base,
do not yet adequately inform this critical clinical
decision-making [13].

Clinical practice guidelines generally do not address
how to treat COPD in the context of comorbid condi-
tions [11]. As such, these guidelines may be of little help
when dealing with the majority of COPD patients
[30,31]. For example, -blockers, which are indicated for
cardiovascular disease, may worsen lung function in
some patients with COPD; some studies, however, have
shown that this is not a contraindication to the initiation
of -blockers [32]. Conversely, bronchodilators, which
are believed to be beneficial for pulmonary function, may
worsen tachyarrhythmias [9]. Guidance about these po-
tential interactions, and the quality of evidence support-
ing any recommendations about them, would be very
useful to clinicians. Our results can inform clinical prac-
tice guideline priority-setting processes to determine
which comorbidities should be addressed in future
COPD guidelines.
It is imperative that therapeutic trials be designed to
reflect the true population of people with COPD. Many
studies exclude patients with significant comorbid condi-
tions [33]. Herland et al. found that only 17% of a group
of COPD patients would be eligible for a "typical" clinical
trial. 65.9% of COPD patients in this study were
"excluded" due to significant comorbidities, including
diabetes, depression, and ischemic heart disease [34].
These exclusions may be troublesome given the high
prevalence of these diseases in people with COPD, and
the potential for interactions between the diseases and
their treatments. Our study highlights the need for future
clinical trials to evaluate safety and effectiveness in
COPD patients with multiple comorbidities.
There is evidence that treating COPD may benefit the
course of comorbid conditions, and, visa-versa [35]. For
example, several observational studies have shown

improved outcomes in COPD patients treated with sta-
tins [36,37], independent of whether patients have a
comorbid diagnosis of ischemic heart disease [38]. While
a randomized controlled trial has shown an improve-
ment in exercise tolerance in COPD patients treated
with statins [39], more prospective intervention trials are
needed to look at the use of statins in COPD [40].
Given these potential complications of treatment and
the interactions between comorbid conditions and
COPD, some researchers have started to advocate for an
integrated-care approach to the management of patients
with COPD. Sonetti et al. in a recent review advocate for
a chronic care model approach to COPD management,
with an approach that includes automatic screening for
common comorbidities [41,42]. In order to truly move
to such a system, however, it is necessary to have a good
understanding of how best to treat COPD in the context
of comorbid conditions. First steps to accomplishing this
are (a) determining common "patterns" of co-existing
conditions (b) including patients with comorbid condi-
tions in clinical trials with appropriate analytic strategies
to understand heterogeneity of treatment effect [43] (c)
evaluating current treatment regimens in patients with
different patterns of comorbid conditions and (d) con-
tinuing to study possible pathophysiologic connections
between COPD and comorbidities. Further research
should also continue to explore the effects comorbid
conditions have on outcomes (health-related and other)
in COPD.
Limitations
As spirometry data is not available in NHANES 1999­
2006, we were not able to look at comorbidities in the
context of the severity of COPD. This is significant be-
cause a recent study showed that increased respiratory
impairment was associated with a higher risk of having
comorbid hypertension, CVD, and diabetes [8].
Also due to the absence of spirometry data, we defined
COPD via self-report. While this does not meet the gold
standard definition for COPD (which is spirometric) [5],
we are aware of no other applicable datasets that are
nationally-representative and as comprehensive and
current as NHANES 1999­2008. For example, NHANES
1988­1994 has spirometry data on a subset of partici-
pants; but, given the changing demographics of the US,
it is unlikely this data is entirely representative of the
current US population.
We acknowledge that the prevalence of comorbidities
in physician-diagnosed COPD may be different than
that in spirometrically-defined COPD; for example,
patients with a higher burden of disease and lower
health status may be more likely to receive a physician
diagnosis of COPD. There is also likely misclassification
of some subjects - subjects with spirometrically-defined
COPD in the group without physician-diagnosed COPD,
and subjects who reported a physician-diagnosis of
COPD, but who would not meet spirometric criteria.
Given the available data, and the desire to assess comor-
bidities in a larger sample of adults across multiple waves
of NHANES, we believe physician-diagnosed COPD is a
relevant outcome.
A study by Barr et al. found that self-report-based sur-
veys are an appropriate way to study respiratory disease
in healthcare professionals [44], and many studies of
comorbidities in COPD have used self-report [20]. We
found little difference in the prevalence of comorbid
conditions between COPD subjects with and without a
history of smoking, which helps validate our definition
of COPD. Our definitions of many of the comorbidities
were similarly limited by the need to, in some cases, de-
fine conditions by self-report.
We were also limited by factors included in the
NHANES data set. We would have liked to assess war-
farin use in COPD patients (our sample size was too

runs HIV tests on subjects between the ages of 18 and
49), insomnia/sleeping problems [27] (only assessed in
NHANES 2005­2008), gastroesophageal reflux disease,
pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia (these conditions
were not directly assessed in NHANES).
Conclusions
Comorbid conditions are the rule, not the exception, in
patients with physician-diagnosed COPD. While 96.4%
of adults 45 and older with COPD have at least one con-
dition that may complicate the treatment of COPD, few
trials or practice guidelines take these conditions into
consideration. Describing the nationally-representative
prevalence of comorbid conditions in patients with
physician-diagnosed COPD is the first step towards
developing an evidence base, and clinical practice guide-
lines, that better represent the true population of patients
with COPD.
