DESPITE THE DRAMATIC DE-
cline in dental caries in the
US population following the
widespread practice of fluo-
ridation of public water supplies,1 tooth
decay remains a major public health
problem. By age 17 years, 84% of US
adolescents have experienced tooth de-
cay in their permanent teeth--on aver-
age, involving 8 tooth surfaces.2 The an-
nual treatment costs for dental caries in
the United States are estimated to be at
least $4.5 billion.3 If left untreated, tooth
decay can result in substantial morbid-
ity due to pain, dysfunction, and poor
appearance. Although most children ex-
perience minimal levels of decay, about
25% of children account for 80% of all
decayed surfaces observed in the popu-
lation.4 Individuals who are impover-
ished experience a disproportionately
high burden of dental caries.5 Unfortu-
nately, factors responsible for this dis-
parity in caries have remained elusive.
The role of trace elements in the de-
velopment of tooth decay has been an
area of study since the identification of
fluoride's protective effects.6 Lead,
which accumulates in bones and teeth,
is of particular interest because of its
wide distribution in the environment.
Several ecologic and cross-sectional
studies, conducted in the 1960s and
1970s, implicated lead as a risk factor
for dental caries.7 These studies, how-
ever, were inconclusive. In recent years,
lead has been identified as a risk
factor for dental caries in 2 cross-
sectional studies conducted in Spain.8,9
However, the most compelling basis for
a causal relationship between lead ex-
posure and dental caries showed pre-
natal and perinatal lead exposure to be
linked to increased incidence of caries
in a well-controlled animal study.10

ses was to examine the association be-
tween blood lead level and dental caries

Context Experiments show that dental caries rates are higher among lead-exposed
animals, but this association has not been established in humans.
Objective To examine the relationship between blood lead levels and dental caries.
Design Cross-sectional survey conducted from 1988 to 1994 that included a dental
examination and venipuncture blood lead assay.
Setting and Participants A total of 24 901 persons aged 2 years and older who
participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which as-
sessed the health and nutritional status of children and adults in the United States.
Main Outcome Measures For children aged 2 to 11 years, the sum of decayed
and filled deciduous or primary surfaces; for persons aged 6 years and older, the sum
of decayed and filled permanent surfaces; for those 12 years and older, the sum of
decayed, missing, and filled surfaces.
Results The log of blood lead level was significantly associated with the number of
affected surfaces for both deciduous and permanent teeth in all age groups, even after
adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, diet, and dental care. Among children
aged 5 to 17 years, a 0.24-µmol/L (5-µg/dL) change in blood lead level was associated
with an elevated risk of dental caries (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-
2.5). Differences in blood lead level explained some of the differences in caries preva-
lence in different income levels and regions of the United States. We estimated the popu-
lation attributable risk of lead exposure to be 13.5% and 9.6% of dental caries occurring
in 5- to 17-year-olds exposed to the high and moderate levels, respectively.
Conclusions Environmental lead exposure is associated with an increased preva-
lence of dental caries in the US population. Findings may help explain the distribution
of caries by income and region of the United States.

sonal household interviews and health
examinations of approximately 40 000
persons aged 2 months and older who
were interviewed over a 6-year period
(1988-1994). The household inter-
view collected demographic, socioeco-
nomic, dietary, and health history in-
formation.Theexaminationcomponent
consisted of physical and dental exami-
nationsandvariouslaboratorytestsfrom
venipuncture and urine specimens.
The health examination included an
oral health component performed by a
licensed dentist on examinees aged 1
year and older. Results from the dental
examinationforcoronalcarieswereused
for this study. Details of the methods
used in the oral health component of the
survey that relate to coronal caries have
beenpublishedpreviously.4,11,12 Forchil-
dren 2 to 11 years of age with at least 1
primary tooth, the sum of decayed and
filleddeciduousorprimarysurfaces(dfs)
was analyzed. For persons 6 years and
older with at least 1 permanent tooth,
the sum of decayed and filled perma-
nent surfaces (DFS) was analyzed. For
persons 12 years and older, the sum of
decayed, missing, and filled surfaces
(DMFS) was also included in the analy-
sis. Children aged 12 to 23 months only
had a brief inspection for the presence
of early childhood caries and were ex-
cluded from these analyses. For this
study, persons were also categorized as
being either caries free or caries active
(non­caries free).
The primary independent variable
was environmental lead exposure.
Blood specimens were collected dur-
ing the examination component of the
survey from examinees aged 1 year and
older and lead levels were deter-
mined. Blood lead levels below the de-
tection limit were assigned a value of
0.03 µmol/L (0.7 µg/dL). Lead levels
were log transformed to normalize the
distribution of blood lead levels.
Other potential independent asso-
ciations with dental caries were ana-
lyzed. Demographic characteristics in-
cluded age, sex, race, family poverty
level, region of the country, educa-
tional level of head of household, and
exposure to cigarette smoke in the
home. Family poverty level was de-
fined as the poverty income ratio (PIR),
calculated as the total family income di-
vided by the poverty threshold for the
year of the interview. A PIR of 1 rep-
resents a family at 100% of the federal
poverty level. As family income in-
creases the PIR increases. Carbohy-
drate and calcium intakes from a 24-
hour dietary recall interview were also
included in the analysis. Use of oral
health services was determined by time
since the last visit to a dentist and how
often the person visited a dentist or den-
tal hygienist.
Bivariate analyses were conducted to
determine associations with caries-
free status. Analyses were stratified by
age group (2-5 years, 6-11 years, and
12 years) to account for the differ-
ent definitions of dental caries based on
age. Variables found to be statistically
significant based on 2 and t tests were
included in logistic regression analy-
ses to determine independent associa-
tions with caries-free status. In addi-
tion, variables were included if previous
studies identified an important role in
the epidemiology of dental caries.
SUDAAN software (Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)
was used to account for the complex
multistage sampling design of the sur-
vey. Sample weights were used to pro-
duce national estimates by adjusting for
the oversampling of young children and
older adults as well as for Mexican
American and black individuals.
Previous epidemiological studies of
caries in permanent teeth of children
in the United States have focused on 5-
to 17-year-olds.1,2,4 To put the find-
ings into context, the potential public
health impact of lead exposure on child-
hood caries in permanent teeth was ex-
amined for individuals aged 5 to 17
years. Population attributable risk
(PAR) estimates were derived using
Levin's formula:
PAR% =
Prevalence  (Relative Risk - 1)  100
[Prevalence  (Relative Risk - 1) + 1]
where prevalence is the prevalence of
the risk factor in the population and
relative risk is that estimated using the
observed odds ratio.13
Assessment of environmental lead as
a confounder of associations between
other risk factors and permanent tooth
decay in childhood was done by com-
paring risk estimates that were unad-
justed for lead with estimates that were
derived from analyses that included a
lead variable. Poverty level, race, and
geographic region were of interest be-
cause these factors have been shown to
be associated with lead exposure14 and
caries status.1,4,5
RESULTS
A total of 24 901 individuals had both
an oral examination and a blood lead as-
say. TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 show the dis-
tributions by age group for dental car-
ies and blood lead level, respectively.
There were statistically significant as-
sociationsbetweenlogofbloodleadlevel

in both unadjusted and adjusted analy-
ses (TABLE 3). As defined by the sum of

ous (dfs) and permanent teeth (DFS) or

association of blood lead level and den-
tal caries was statistically significant
among all 3 age groups. Each of the lin-
ear regression models was adjusted for
age,sex,race,educationallevel,PIR,ciga-
rette smoke exposure, calcium intake,
days since last dental visit, frequency of
dental visits, and geographic region.
Among children 5 to 17 years of age,
comparisons of caries-free children vs
those with some caries (DMFS 1)
showed that a 0.24-µmol/L (5-µg/dL)
change in blood lead level was associ-
ated with an elevated risk for caries
(odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence inter-
val, 1.3-2.5). We used the age-specific
tertiles shown in Table 2 to define high,
moderate, and low exposure to lead in
children aged 5 to 17 years. The popu-
lation attributable risk of lead expo-
sure is estimated to be 13.5% of dental
caries among individuals exposed to the
highest age-specific tertile of lead level
and 9.6% of caries among individuals
exposed to the middle age-specific ter-
tile of lead level, compared with the
lowest tertile (TABLE 4).
Lead exposure was further assessed
as a confounder by examining changes
in point estimates that occurred when
regression model coefficients were com-
pared with and without adjustment for
the log of blood lead level. Results were
obtained for the 5- to 17-year-old age
group for both logistic regression and
linear regression models, using caries
status (present or absent) and number
of DMFS as the dependent variables, re-
spectively. Adjustment for blood lead
level attenuated the association of car-
ies status most strongly with PIR
(TABLE 5). Comparing the Northeast
with the West, regional differences in
caries status are reduced after adjust-
ment for lead as evidenced by the
change in the parameter estimate when
comparing models with and without
lead exposure. In the logistic regres-
sion models, the difference between the
unadjusted and adjusted parameter es-
timate for the association between resi-
dence in the West region of the United
States and dental caries status equates
to a 17% difference in the relative risk
estimate attributable to lead exposure
(unadjusted odds ratio, 0.75 vs ad-
justed odds ratio, 0.91).
COMMENT
Trace elements in the environment have
long been implicated in the develop-
ment of dental caries.15 The discovery
of the protective role of fluoride in den-
tal caries during the 1930s and 1940s
was followed by the widespread prac-
tice of adjusting public water supplies
to an optimal level of 0.8 to 1.2 ppm
of fluoride.16 Since then, dental caries
levels in children in the US popula-
tion have dramatically declined. This
decline has largely been attributed to
the increased levels of fluoride in drink-
ing water and dentifrices.1,17
The association between poverty sta-
tus and dental caries in the NHANES
III data has been the topic of a recent
study. Vargas et al5 showed that fam-
ily income level was particularly linked
with the proportion of children hav-
ing decayed teeth. As income level in-
creased, children were less likely to have
any decayed teeth. About 20% of 6- to
14-year-old children from families with
incomes at 0% to 100% of the federal
poverty level had at least 1 decayed
tooth. Only 3% of children from fami-
lies with incomes that were 301% of the
federal poverty level or higher had 1 or
more decayed teeth.
The results of the present analyses
suggest that environmental lead expo-
sure may explain, at least in part, the
disproportionately high rate of dental
caries among disadvantaged children
and adolescents. Without the lead ex-
posure variable in the statistical model,
the PIR shows that the odds of having
a decayed, filled, or missing perma-
nent tooth decrease as income level in-
creases, a finding consistent with that
of Vargas et al.5 Statistical adjustment
for lead exposure reduced the strength
of the association between income level
and caries status. This suggests that the
association between poverty and den-
tal caries is partially explained by lead
exposure.
These data are also consistent with
the hypothesis that the decline in en-

vironmental lead exposure18,19 may also
have contributed to the decline in the
prevalence of dental caries. Previous
epidemiological studies have not re-
ported associations between lead ex-
posure and dental caries that are as
strong as those observed in this analy-
sis. On a population basis, the wide-
spread exposure to a strong protective
factor such as fluoride allows for the
emergence of other risk factors.20,21 We
speculate that when fluoride exposure
was variable in the population, the im-
pact of other risk factors was overshad-
owed by the caries patterns explained
by fluoride exposure. Now that expo-
sure to fluoride is relatively uniform,
the role of lead in dental caries has be-
come more striking.
Because fluoride exposure is strongly
linked to dental caries risk, one must
consider whether lead exposure is sim-
ply a marker for residence in an area that
isnotservedbyfluoridateddrinkingwa-
ter. An association between patterns of
lead exposure and fluoridation expo-
sure would result in a mixing of effects
and a spurious association between lead
and dental caries. However, since fluo-
ridation occurs at the community level,
this seems unlikely. In the United States,
efforts to prevent tooth decay focus on
community drinking water systems. At
present, 70% of all cities with popula-
tions of more than 100 000 receive fluo-
ridated water.3 It seems likely that el-
evated lead exposure is independent of
fluoridation status since public water
supplies serve the same water to indi-
viduals with a range of lead exposure.
Nevertheless, the NHANES III data do
not provide information on fluoride ex-
posure so further study is needed to re-
solve this issue.
Small geographic differences in
prevalence surveys of dental caries in
representative samples of US school-
children have been reported.1,22 While
the magnitude of these regional differ-
ences has declined over time, lead ex-
posure may explain some of the ob-
served differences. The West region has
generally had low rates of mean DMFS
in children aged 5 to 17 years and the
Northeast region has had high rates of
DMFS. Data collected in 1971-1974 and
1979-1980 showed differences of 8.1 vs
6.3 and 5.6 vs 4.4 DMFS, respectively,
for Northeast and West regions.
Lead exposure may be a confounder
for these observed regional differences.
Specifically, our results suggest that
some of the advantage children in the
western United States experience rela-
tive to children in the Northeast may be
partially explained by lead exposure.
Other regional differences did not ap-
pear to be confounded by lead expo-
sure. NHANES III was not designed to
accountforseasonalvariationinleadex-
posure and this may introduce measure-
ment error in the assessment of re-
gional patterns associated with blood
lead levels.14
We cannot demonstrate conclu-
sively that environmental lead expo-
sure is causally linked to dental caries
on the basis of observational data alone.
Because of the complexity of factors that
are linked both to dental caries and lead
exposure, residual confounding is likely
to be problematic. However, we have
attempted to adjust for the potential
confounding effect of socioeconomic
status in our models, and the plausi-
bility of these observations is strength-
ened by recent experimental data.
Watson et al10 found that exposure
to lead, prenatally and perinatally, re-
sulted in a high rate of dental caries in
laboratory rats. In the study, female rats
were exposed to 34 ppm of lead in
drinking water as young adults, dur-
ing pregnancy, and during lactation.
Maternal blood lead levels averaged
2.32 µmol/L (48 µg/dL). After wean-
ing, experimental and control rat pups

were fed a high-sugar diet known to ac-
celerate caries development. After 5
weeks, pups born to the lead-exposed
rats had significantly more dental car-
ies lesions than controls.
Three different mechanisms can be
hypothesized concerning lead expo-
sure and dental caries: salivary gland
function, enamel formation, and inter-
ference with fluoride in saliva. Wat-
son et al10 showed differences in sali-
vary gland function, which suggested
that exposure to lead during salivary
gland development may have ad-
versely affected the ability of the gland
to produce adequate amounts of sa-
liva. Saliva has several protective prop-
erties that operate against caries: it acts
as a buffering agent when acids are pro-
duced,itphysicallyremovesdebrisfrom
tooth surfaces, and it has immuno-
logic and bacteriostatic properties.23
Lead also incorporates into tooth struc-
ture before the tooth erupts into the
mouth and this may result in defec-
tive enamel that is more susceptible to
caries.24 Also, lead may interfere with
the bioavailability of fluoride by bind-
ing to fluoride ions in saliva and plaque,
thereby reducing the preventive capac-
ity of fluoride to remineralize enamel
after an acid challenge.25
The cross-sectional nature of the
NHANESIIIdataimposeslimitationson
theabilitytotestmechanism-specifichy-
potheses. For example, if lead exposure
at the time of enamel formation were the
most relevant mechanism for a lead-
cariescausalassociation,onewouldneed
to assume that current blood lead level
is a good estimate of lead exposure dur-
ing early childhood when teeth are
formed. In cross-sectional data, such as
NHANES III, the most relaxed assump-
tionswouldberequiredforarecenttem-
poral effect if lead exposure status were
subject to change over time.
The present analysis supports the
hypothesis that environmental lead ex-
posure is a risk factor for dental caries.
Nonetheless, a mechanistic role to ex-
plaindifferencesincariesprevalencehas
not been clearly established for lead. In
support of a causal role for lead in den-
tal caries, there are compelling experi-
mental data from well-controlled ani-
mal studies that support the biologic
plausibilityofthehypothesisandwehave
observed a dose-response trend. Still, to
satisfy the criteria for causality, further
prospectiveinvestigationswillbeneeded
to demonstrate that lead exposure pre-
cedes the development of caries in hu-
mans after adequate control of poten-
tial confounders and that these findings
are consistent across different popula-
tions and with different study designs.

tant implications concerning the need

ing dietary habits, improving personal
