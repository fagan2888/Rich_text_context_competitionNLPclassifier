ENHANCEMENT OF COGNITIVE AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL
MEASURES OF HIPPOCAMPAL FUNCTIONING IN RATS BY A LOW, BUT
NOT HIGH, DOSE OF DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE SULFATE (DHEAS)

2 Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is a steroid hornone that is synthesized, de novo,
in the brain. Endogenous DHEAS levels correlate with the quality of mental and physical health,
where the highest levels of DHEAS occur in healthy young adults and reduced levels of DHEAS
are found with advanced age, disease, or extreme stress. DHEAS supplementation, therefore, may
serve as a therapeutic agent against a broad range of maladies. This paper summarizes labora-
tory findings on dose-response relationships between DHEAS and cognitive and electrophysiological
measures of hippocampal functioning. It was found that a low, but not a high, dose of DHEAS en-
hanced hippocampal primed burst potentiation (a physiological model of memory) as well as spatial
(hippocampal-dependent) memory in rats. This complex dose-response function of DHEAS effects on
the brain and memory may contribute toward the inconsistent findings that have been obtained by
other investigators in studies on DHEAS administration in people.

INTRODUCTION
Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is in a category of hormones
referred to as "neurosteroids" because they are synthesized, de novo, in the
nervous system as well as in the periphery (Baulieu, 1998; Baulieu et al., 2001).
DHEAS is the most abundant adrenal steroid found in young healthy adult
primates, but its concentrations decline dramatically with advanced age and
disease (Parker and Schuster, 1991; Ferrari et al., 2001). For example, very
old primates, including rhesus monkeys and people, have only about 10%
of the levels of DHEAS normally found in young adults (Lane et al., 1997;
Mattison et al., 2003). Moreover, a great reduction of DHEAS concentration is
found under conditions of extreme physical stress, such as with severe burns
(Dolecek, 1989; Araneo et al., 1993). These findings of diminished DHEAS
levels consistently occurring under adverse health conditions have led to the

suggestion that supplementation with DHEAS may serve a preventive role in
ameliorating the adverse symptoms of aging, disease, and stress. DHEAS ad-
ministration, therefore, has been evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent
in the treatment of a broad range of maladies, including AIDS (Clerici
et al., 1997; Araghi-Niknam et al., 1998), Alzheimer's disease (Wolkowitz et al.,
2003), and depression (Reus et al., 1997; van Broekhoven and Verkes, 2003).
For these reasons, there is a large market for DHEAS, which is sold without
a prescription as a dietary supplement. However, whereas the literature on
the evidence of low endogenous DHEAS levels in various disease states is ex-
tensive, the evidence that DHEAS supplementation is of therapeutic value is
inconsistent (Nippoldt and Nair, 1998; Wolf and Kirschbaum, 1999; Kuiper-
Geertsma and Derksen, 2003). The purpose of this paper is to review and
summarize work from my laboratory on the effects of DHEAS supplemen-
tation on memory and the brain in rats. Specifically, we have investigated
the effects of DHEAS administration on cognitive and electrophysiological
aspects of the functioning of the hippocampus, a brain structure that is impor-
tant for learning and memory processes (Eichenbaum, 2001; Burgess et al.,
2002; Sanders et al., 2003). The findings may prove to be relevant to the
inconsistent effects of DHEAS on mental and physical health in people.
EFFECTS OF DHEAS ON HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY
There is extensive evidence to indicate that DHEAS has potent modu-
latory effects on the nervous system. DHEAS increases synaptic excitability
by reducing GABAA-mediated inhibition (Baulieu, 1998; Meyer et al., 1999;
Park-Chung et al., 1999). This increase in excitability is particularly important
because neurophysiological models of memory have shown that a reduction
of GABAergic inhibition can enhance the physiological processes that un-
derlie memory (Chapman et al., 1998; Grover and Yan, 1999; Levkovitz et al.,
1999). Moreover, NMDA receptor activation is a critical component of the
physiology of memory (Nicoll and Malenka, 1999; Huang and Hsu, 2001).
Here again, DHEAS exerts an effect that is consistent with its role as a memory
facilitator (Roberts et al., 1987; Flood and Roberts, 1988; Flood et al., 1988;
Vallee et al., 2001). DHEAS enhances NMDA channel activity and increases
the number of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus (Bergeron et al., 1996;
Baulieu, 1998; Wen et al., 2001). Finally, there is evidence of neurogenesis
in the adult hippocampus across a broad range of species, including rats
and people, and the neurogenesis process appears to be important for new
learning in adults (Gould et al., 2000; Seri et al., 2001; Shors et al., 2001).
DHEAS appears to facilitate this process by stimulating additional neurogen-
esis and promoting the survival of newly formed cells (Karishma and Herbert,
2002). Taken together, there is strong evidence that DHEAS supplementa-
tion exerts a profound facilitating effect on hippocampal functioning in the
adult.
DHEAS and Hippocampal Functioning 373
On this background of evidence of DHEAS as a positive modulator of hip-
pocampal functioning, my colleagues and I studied the effects of DHEAS ad-
ministration on an electrophysiological model of memory, which is referred
to as primed burst (PB) potentiation (Rose and Dunwiddie, 1986; Diamond
et al., 1988). The idea in this area of research is that electrical stimulation of
the hippocampus mimics the changes in synapses that occur during mem-
ory formation. Thus, a DHEAS-induced modulation of PB potentiation may
provide insight into how DHEAS affects learning and memory.
In recordings from adult male Sprague Dawley (Charles Rivers) rats, we
found a U-shaped dose-response function between DHEAS and PB potentia-
tion. That is, whereas intermediate doses (24 and 48 mg/kg) of DHEAS given
intraperitoneally increased both the magnitude and incidence of PB poten-
tiation, the highest (96 mg/kg) and lowest (6 mg/kg) doses had no effect
(Diamond et al., 1996). This work provided the first evidence of nonlinear
dose-response characteristics of DHEAS actions on hippocampal synaptic
plasticity.
EFFECTS OF CHRONIC ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF DHEAS
ON MEMORY AND HIPPOCAMPAL PLASTICITY
In the next phase of the research, we administered DHEAS chronically
to rats in their drinking water and then tested their spatial learning and
memory in the Morris water maze. In this task, rats learn to escape from
water immersion by learning and then remembering the location of a fixed
platform, which is hidden just beneath the surface of the water (Brandeis
et al., 1989). Rats learn spatial information rapidly and are highly motivated
to escape from the water. Thus, a reduction in the time to escape across
training trials indicates that a rat has the motivation to escape the water and
has learned the location of the hidden platform.
Rats were given the vehicle (lemonade-flavored water) or one of two doses
of DHEAS mixed in the their drinking water (100 or 400 µg/100 ml) for 1
week prior to water maze training. The rats were given five training trials on
day 1 in which they had up to 2 min/trial to learn the location of the hidden
platform. On the second day of training all rats were given a single memory
test trial. Rats that remembered the platform location took less time to find
the platform than rats that had impaired memory of the platform location.
On the first day of training, all three groups reduced their time to find
the hidden platform equally over the course of the five training trials, in-
dicating that they had equivalent learning abilities and that they were all
motivated to escape from the water. A difference in performance was ob-
served on the 24-h memory test trial. As can be seen from the right-hand
side of Figure 1, rats given 100 µg/100 ml of DHEAS-treated water, but not
those given 400 µg/100 ml, were superior (that is, had lower escape laten-
cies) to rats treated with the vehicle or 400 µg/100 ml of DHEAS. Thus,
374 D. M. Diamond
FIGURE 1 A lower, but not a higher, dose of DHEAS enhanced spatial memory and hippocampal PB
potentiation. Rats administered 100 µg/100 ml of DHEAS in their drinking water exhibited superior
spatial memory (i.e., less time to swim to the hidden platform) to the control (vehicle) and the high-
dose (400 µg/100 ml) groups (right-hand side). The group of rats with superior memory also exhibited
significantly greater PB potentiation (left-hand side) than the controls and the group treated with 400 µg/
100 ml. Overall, the group chronically treated with 100 µg/100 ml of DHEAS in their drinking water
exhibited superior memory and greater hippocampal plasticity.
the intermediate dose of DHEAS produced superior spatial memory perfor-
mance compared to the other two groups (Diamond and Fleshner, 1999).
What might be the basis of the DHEAS-induced enhancement of mem-
ory? To address this question, we recorded PB potentiation in the same an-
imals that had been trained in the water maze. Once water maze training
had been completed, the rats continued to receive DHEAS in their drinking
water until the day in which the electrophysiological recordings took place.
On that day, the rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, ip) and PB
was recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus according to methods
described previously (Bennett et al., 1991; Diamond et al., 1992, 1996, 1999).
The left-hand side of Figure 1 shows the magnitude of PB in the vehicle- and
DHEAS-treated groups. The dose of DHEAS that enhanced spatial mem-
ory (l00 µg/100 ml) also increased the magnitude of PB potentiation. The
magnitude of PB potentiation was relatively small in the control and high-
dose groups (21 and 18% increases, respectively) and significantly greater
in the group that received the intermediate dose (Diamond and Fleshner,
1999). Thus, the enhanced memory observed in the rats that received the
100 µg/100 ml dose may have resulted from the enhanced expression of
DHEAS and Hippocampal Functioning 375
hippocampal synaptic plasticity (PB potentiation) occurring selectively at
this dose.
SUMMARY
I have presented findings on the complex dose-response functions of
DHEAS on cognitive and electrophysiological aspects of hippocampal func-
tioning in rats. My group reported that there is an inverted U-shaped re-
lationship between acute administration of DHEAS and the magnitude of
synaptic plasticity (PB potentiation) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
In addition, chronic oral administration of DHEAS produced a complex
dose-response function, in which the lower dose of DHEAS enhanced both
memory and PB potentiation and the higher dose had no effect on either
measure. These findings of complex nonlinear dose-response functions be-
tween DHEAS and hippocampal functioning may be relevant to the incon-
sistent effects of DHEAS administration on brain, behavior, and pathological
conditions in people.
