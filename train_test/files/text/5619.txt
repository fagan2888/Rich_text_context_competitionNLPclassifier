Introduction
Levels of distress in family carers of individuals with disa-
bilities can be high (Gallagher and Whiteley, 2013; Pinquart
and Sörensen, 2003; Vitaliano et al., 2003), and this has
been associated with increased morbidity and mortality
(Schulz and Beach, 1999). Furthermore, the potentially
harmful effect of life distress as experienced by caregivers
of functionally dependent persons is exacerbated by the
long-term nature of care recipient needs and behavioural
symptoms (e.g. Gallagher et al., 2009; Vitaliano et al.,
2003). In fact, alongside this, and given the large number of
caregivers in national populations (Ireland, 278,000; United
Kingdom, 6.5
million; United States, 67.5
million), car-
egiver health has now been argued to be a public health
concern (Talley and Crews, 2007). However, not all car-
egivers succumb to poor health (Vedhara et al., 2002), some
cope extremely well with the demands of caregiving. For
example, a population-based study from the United States
found decreased mortality in caregivers who spent more
time caregiving (Brown et al., 2009), implying a paradox in
the literature. Moreover, alongside the stress of caring, car-
egivers also report uplifts and rewards, and a review of the
literature on these aspects revealed a health-promoting
effect in caregivers (Pinquart and Sörensen, 2003).
Additionally, studies have recently found that caregivers
who perceived more benefit finding (BF), that is, an
increase in perceived positive growth in areas of relation-
ships, gratefulness, spirituality and meaning making, had
increased social support which in turn predicted higher
quality of life (QoL; Brand et al., 2014). Similar findings
have been reported elsewhere (Cassidy, 2013; Kim et al.,
2007; Pakenham, 2005; Samios et al., 2011), attesting to
the positive contribution BF has for caregiver health.
Caregivers may engage in BF as a cognitive strategy for
coping with stress (Brand et al., 2014).As part of that cogni-
tive strategy, those who engage in BF transform their view
of themselves, others and their place in the world to produce

Abstract
Caregivers may engage in benefit finding, that is, an increase in perceived positive growth, as a cognitive strategy for
coping with stress. The Building Resources in Caregivers study will compare effects of a brief benefit finding writing
intervention with a control intervention. Caregivers of people with mental and physical disabilities will be randomised
into either a benefit-writing group or a neutral writing group. Caregivers will complete measures relating to themselves
and care-recipients (e.g. sociodemographics and illness type) and psychometric measures of benefit finding, distress and
quality of life at three time points. Additionally, qualitative commentary on participation experiences will be gathered.

Intervention Study
2 Health Psychology Open 
a positive psychological change after a traumatic event
through a process of cognitive restructuring (Cheng et al.,
2014; Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004). Thus, increasing BF
through intervention may be one way to improve coping
mechanisms in caregivers and to build resources to deal
with the challenges of caring. Indeed, harnessing the power
of BF through intervention may be a key way of helping
caregivers deal with the unpleasant nature of caring.
Although the body of evidence attesting to the negative
effects of caring cannot be ignored, equally one cannot
ignore these positive findings and the potential of BF as an
intervention strategy for caregivers has just being harnessed
with positive results (Cheng et al., 2014).
Caregivers who participated in an 8-week BF interven-
tion were found to have lower depression scores relative to
a control group immediately after the intervention (Cheng
et al., 2014); whether these reductions were maintained over
time is not yet known. As well as the lack of maintenance
data, it is not known whether improvements in BF were evi-
dent, which was due to lack of measurement of the con-
struct. As such, it is difficult to know whether BF was
driving the observed effects. Moreover, previous cognitive
restructuring interventions with caregivers' reasons suggest
that providing too many restructuring techniques may hin-
der caregivers to integrate and apply all those learned simul-
taneously in their daily lives (Lavoie et al., 2005), implying
that simple and brief techniques may have more utility.
Similarly, given that caregivers are notoriously difficult to
recruit for interventions, primarily due to time and respite
constraints (Pasacreta and McCorkle, 1999) and lack of
transport (Areán and Gallagher-Thompson, 1996), it was
hardly surprising that only 25 caregivers were recruited in
total which impacts on the generalisability of the study.
Other barriers to recruitment include inaccessibility to the
research site and mistrust of researchers (Dowling and
Wiener, 1997; Gallagher-Thompson et al., 2003; Lampley-
Dallas, 2002; Moreno-John et al., 2004). Thus, considering
the limitations of earlier studies and the constraints and bar-
riers in conducting face-to-face interventions, in addition to
the considerable costs involved, a solution which can cir-
cumvent some of these obstacles is using an online environ-
ment to deliver a brief and simple writing intervention.
Generally, conducting research online saves time by
making research instruments and content available instantly,
saves money in terms of space/travel and other additional
costs associated with the employment of those involved in
the face-to-face administration of the project (Kazdin and
Rabbitt, 2013). Apropos of all the preceding benefits of
conducting online research, there is another even more rel-
evant reason for applying an online approach to conducting
this research with caregivers. Due to the nature of caregiv-
ing, a lack of time for oneself is a re-occurring theme within
caregiving narratives and is also identified as a reason for
increased burden on caregivers (Zarit et al., 1980), as con-
tributing to an inability to meet their own personal needs
(Grant and Davis, 1997). Hence, E-health also has the
potential to remove the time and space barrier between car-
egivers and therapists.
Importantly, caregivers will take part in this study on an
individual basis and this Internet-based model of delivering
the study intervention adheres to research recommendations
made by Sörensen et al. (2002) who established that interven-
tions aimed at individual caregivers were more effective in
improving caregiver well-being than group interventions.
Moreover, we have preliminary data employing a randomised
control trial (RCT) methodology to deliver a brief 2-week
Internet-based writing intervention to improve social well-
being (O'Connell et al., 2015) which would be ideally suited
to caregivers who are constrained by both time and geogra-
phy. Thus, feasibility to deliver interventions of this type over
the Internet is already established. Furthermore, Grant and
DePew (1999) recommend developing relationships with the
key individuals in referring agencies, including healthcare
providers and their key personnel in order to aid with recruit-
ment and help retain study participants. Maintaining collabo-
rative relationships with healthcare providers through
presentations and feedback about interventions may foster
important referral sources (Areán and Gallagher-Thompson,
1996). Accordingly, this study will recruit caregivers through
the online social networks operated by the two largest car-
egiver non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Ireland:
Care Alliance Ireland and the Carers Association.
Thus, the primary aim of this Building Resources in
Caregivers (BRiC) intervention is to test the methodology
and feasibility of a brief 2-week Internet-based BF writing
intervention to increase BF with a secondary aim of improv-
ing their overall QoL and psychological health. We will
also seek to ascertain the feasibility of delivering this type
of writing intervention via an Internet-based model.
Methods
Study design
This will be a double-blind, randomised controlled parallel
group trial design, with three measurement periods (T1 ­
baseline, T2 ­ immediately after intervention and T3 ­
3
months later). The between groups will be (a) the
intervention group and (b) the control group (see below for
details). The trial will be conducted in accordance with the
CONSORT guidelines (Turner et al., 2012) with an equal
1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome will be BF
(Antoni et al., 2001) and secondary outcomes the Caregiver
Quality of Life (QoL; Joseph et al., 2012) and Hospital and
Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond and Snaith, 1983).
Ethics for this project has been approved by the universities
Institutional Review Board (no: 2014_12_26_ EHS).
Parallel to the RCT, a brief qualitative component will be
undertaken along with intervention difficulty and acceptabil-
ity ratings. In this qualitative study, participants will be asked
Brand et al. 3
to write comments about the effects of the intervention and
aspects of the intervention method (see below for details).
Observations drawn from the qualitative part of the study
will be used to consider the feasibility aspects of the study.
Participants
Inclusion criteria will be primary caregivers in the Republic
of Ireland aged over 18
years currently providing care to
one or more persons. Those excluded from the proposed
study will be professional caregivers such as those who are
in the employment of institutions of care or home care pro-
vision companies. Caregivers will be recruited through our
NGO collaborators (Care Alliance and Carer's Association)
who have an extensive network of carer groups nationally.
We have worked in partnership with these groups previ-
ously (Brand et al., 2014). The study will be advertised on
their respective websites and appear on Twitter feeds
whereby caregivers can contact the principal investigator
directly to receive the study information sheet, seek clarity
and have the opportunity to ask questions. As in our previ-
ous study (Brand et al., 2014), we will include all caregiv-
ers, as we have found no differences on psychosocial
outcomes in those caring for physical or mental health dis-
abilities. Moreover, this all-inclusive approach allows for
comparisons to be made regarding efficacy and whether the
intervention is appropriate for all caregiver groups.
Sample size calculation
The null hypothesis of this between-subjects RCT is that there
are no significant differences in well-being in caregivers who
write their thoughts and feelings in a diary about the benefits
of caregiving and those caregivers who write about topics
unrelated to their caregiving activities. Based on previous
research (Cheng et al., 2014), a power calculation with a
medium effect size of F=.25, p<.05 and power of .8, the total
sample size required is 86, with 43 in each trial arm (calcu-
lated with G*Power Version 3.9). Participant demographic
information will be gathered at the beginning of the T1 data
collection process which should, according to Bosnjak and
Tuten (2001) minimise the dropout rate to approximately 10.5
per cent. Therefore, a sample size of 96 caregivers will be
recruited to provide data for the final analysis.
Recruitment
Caregivers will be recruited using social media and via the
e-mail communications platforms used by Care Alliance
and The Carer's Association. On the respective caregiver
websites, potential participants will be invited to read a
short description of the study on the organisation home
pages. Should they wish to obtain further information, they
will be directed to a link bringing them to a web page where
they can read more detailed information about the study.
Once they are satisfied that they have read sufficient infor-
mation about the study, they will be directed to a link on the
consent page which they can click should they wish to par-
ticipate. The consent forms and questionnaires will be
delivered over the Internet through QuestBackTM software.
Intervention
The proposed intervention will be based on and informed by
prior work in the BF interventions literature (Cheng et al.,
2014; Henry et al., 2010) which found that cognitive
approaches that focussed on increasing BF among caregivers
had superior results in reducing depression over psychoedu-
cational approaches attempting to achieve the same goal.
Caregivers will be instructed to write about their thoughts
and feelings in a diary/personal notebook focussing on the
benefits of caring, to consider improved social relationships,
the appreciation of life and loved ones, and think about the
positive consequences with respect to these. To better meet
the needs of the caregivers in our study (e.g. time pressures,
sensitivity), we will not ask diaries to be returned. While we
acknowledge that this may be a limitation, if participants do
not engage, then our results should reflect this and our fidel-
ity assessment may provide more information if this is the
case. These activities will be done three times a week for 2
weeks. The control group will be asked to write about the
weather that day for the same number of days.
The intervention group writing instruction will read as
follows:
Writing is a great way to reflect on your life in general and on
the roles we have in life, helping to look back and focus on the
good things in our lives. These things can be big and small. For
the next two weeks, three times a week on the days of your
choosing we encourage you to really let go, explore your
innermost thoughts and feelings about the benefits of providing
care to your loved one and write these thoughts down. Examples
could include writing about becoming closer to your loved one,
focussing on the things your loved one is able to do rather than
what they cannot do, no matter how big or small this is, feeling
needed, more empathetic, accepting, compassionate, new
relationships with others, your loved one or family members;
perhaps seeing your life in a different way - more positive. It
could also be about you and how satisfied you are as a carer
moving forward and learning how your priorities have changed.
These are just examples, but you may have other benefits that
you would like to talk about regarding your caring role, no
matter how big or small they may be. Although when you write
the sentences they can be as long or as short as you like but try
and aim for about 3 or 4 sentences at least.
The control group writing instruction will read as
follows:
Writing is a good way of getting us to reflect a bit better and it
may help improve our well-being. For the next two weeks, on
just six days of your choice (3
days each week), write in a
4 Health Psychology Open 
copybook or a personal diary, a number of things about the
weather on each day. Although when you write the sentences
they can be as long or as short as you like but try and aim for
about 3 or 4 sentences at least.
Procedure
After providing informed consent, caregivers will be ran-
domly allocated using the random allocation feature of sur-
vey QuestBackTM software to the intervention or control
condition. Baseline measures will be completed at T1, for
example, demographics, care recipients details, and pri-
mary and secondary outcome measures; after the 2-week
writing stage is complete, participants will be sent an e-mail
with a link to complete the post-intervention (T2), and
3-month follow-up (T3) assessment, with outcomes as pre-
viously administered at baseline.
Fidelity, implementation and adherence
The writing instructions are a core component of the pro-
posed intervention. In order to ensure as high a level of
adherence to fidelity criteria associated with the main out-
come measure (BF) as possible, the writing instructions for
both the control and intervention groups have been con-
structed in such a way as to induce an equal chance of per-
ceiving benefit. Additionally, to assess the level of
expectation across both groups of perceiving benefit, prior
to random allocation, all participants will be asked to answer
the following question `How well do you expect to feel after
taking part in the writing activities?' on a Likert-type scale
ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 6 (Very well). We would expect
that both groups have a similar level of expectation to ben-
efit from the writing exercise. Moreover, to assess partici-
pant's difficulty and acceptability of the writing exercise at
T2, participants will be asked a series of questions rated on
6-point Likert-type response scales. For example, How dif-
ficult did you find the writing activities to do, 1 (not at all
difficult) to 6 (very difficult); How disruptive of your time
did you find the writing activities, 1 (not at all disruptive) to
6 (very disruptive); How acceptable was it for you to writing
activities for you, 1 (not at all acceptable) to 6 (very
acceptable);and How likely would you recommend this
type of writing activity to other carers, 1 (not at all likely) to
6 (very likely). Furthermore, to improve adherence, caregiv-
ers will receive an e-mail prompt each week to remind them
to write in their diaries. Finally, we will also include a free
form text box where caregivers can respond freely to the
question `If there is anything that we may have forgotten to
ask about your experiences of writing then feel free to write
in the space provided'.
Measures
Caregiver and care-recipients' sociodemographics includ-
ing age, gender, socioeconomic indices and health-related
variables such as illness types, time and hours spent caring
will be captured by questions created in-house.
Primary outcome
All measures of BF will be obtained using the 17-item
Benefit Finding Scale (BFS) (Antoni et al., 2001). The BFS
was originally developed by Behr et al. (1992) as the
Positive Contributions Scale (PCS), which they used to
assess the perceptions of parents of children with special
needs with `Being a parent of a child with special needs'
used as the introductory preamble. Examples of items
include `Has led me to be more accepting of things' and
`Has helped me to take things as they come'. Participants
will be asked to indicate, using a five-point Likert-type
scale ranging from (1) `not at all' to (5) `extremely', the
extent to which each item has applied to them. The total
score of the scale can range from 17 to 85, where higher
values indicate a higher degree of BF. The scale has been in
various populations and has found to have excellent relia-
bility (Cronbach's =.91; Kim et al., 2007; Urcuyo et al.,
2005). We use an adapted version here replacing `parent'
with `caregiver', and in order to capture change in BF, we
replaced the baseline stem to read `Being a parent of a child
with special needs' with `As a caregiver, I feel that' instead
of `Since becoming a caregiver'. We also altered the word-
ing of each item to reflect current feelings (e.g. `I am more
accepting of things' `I take things as they come') so that we
could capture change following the intervention. For T2
and T3 follow-up measures of BF, the stem will be changed
to `After taking part in this writing exercise how much have
the following changed for you? As a caregiver, I feel that
...' with the same 17 original items used.
Secondary outcomes
Caregiver QoL. Caregiver QoL will be measured using the
40-item Adult Carer Quality of Life Questionnaire (AC-
QoL; Joseph et al., 2012). The AC-QoL measures QoL in
eight separate domains: support for caring, caring choice,
caring stress, money matters, personal growth, sense of
value, ability to care and carer satisfaction. Participants will
be asked to indicate the frequency that they feel or experi-
ence different aspects of the caregiving role on a 4-point
Likert­type scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (always). AC-
QoL scores can be calculated for a total QoL using the
entire set of items (range 0­120) or for each of the sub-
scales individually (range 0­15) with higher scores indicat-
ing higher perceived QoL on that subscale. This scale has
also been shown to have excellent consistency reliability
(Cronbach's =.94) with subscales ranging from .78 to .89
(Joseph et al., 2012).
Psychological distress. The Hospital and Anxiety Depression
Scale (HADS; Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) will be measured
as a covariate and secondary outcome of psychological
Brand et al. 5
distress. The HADS is a brief self-report measure that was
specifically designed to screen for distinct dimensions of
anxiety and depression in non-psychiatric hospital depart-
ments. The severity of anxiety and depression are assessed
using two subscales, each one consisting of seven items that
are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3.
Corresponding answers differ depending on the stem ques-
tion for each item statement. For example, Item 2 reads `I
still enjoy the things I used to enjoy': with answers ranging
from 0 (Definitely as much) to 3 (Most of the time). Previous
caregiver research has also used the HADS to investigate
the effect of a family meeting intervention on depression
among family caregivers of people experiencing dementia
(Joling et al., 2012) and parental caregivers (Gallagher et al.,
2008) and the associations between caregiver characteristics
and caregiver burden, perceived health and mood status
(Martinez-Martin et al., 2008). The psychometric properties
of the HADS have been tested for validity and reliability in
a caregiver sample by Gough and Hudson (2009) and dem-
onstrated a high level of internal consistency (=.89).
Statistical analysis
All analysis will be executed using SPSS Statistics 21TM
software package. Prior to formal statistical analysis, suit-
able descriptive statistics will be presented describing the
baseline characteristics of the sample. Bivariate associa-
tions between the variables of interest will be conducted
using correlation analyses. Tests of baseline homogeneity
between the two treatment groups and attrition bias will be
examined using independent samples t-tests and chi-square
analysis. These will also be employed to check for success-
ful randomisation. Preliminary inspections to ensure all
distributional assumptions are met for the formal analysis
will be conducted. All tests of significance will be two
sided, with =.05 as criterion for statistical significance, or
if the 95per cent confidence interval does not contain zero.
Throughout partial eta squared (
p
2 ), Cohen's d and R2 will
be reported as measures of effect size, depending on the
analysis. To test the effectiveness of the intervention versus
the active control on the primary outcomes BF, and second-
ary outcomes QoL, anxiety and depression, across each
follow-up, mixed between­within analyses of variance will
be conducted using complete cases only. Additional post-
hoc analysis will be conducted on significant findings.
Furthermore, as attrition rates in previous studies of this
nature are high, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted
using multilevel linear mixed modelling, where an inten-
tion-to-treat analysis strategy will be employed if there is a
high level of missing data due to dropout. This will include
all available data, and maximum likelihood estimations
will be implemented to handle missing data. Furthermore,
based on the findings in the above mixed between­within
analyses of variance, and to further investigate the relation-
ship between the intervention and outcomes, post-hoc
mediation analysis will be conducted using the PROCESS
macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2013). Finally, measures of central
tendency and dispersion will be used to understand the usa-
bility and feasibility data.
Discussion
This RCT will examine the effectiveness of a brief BF writ-
ing exercise, versus an active control exercise among car-
egivers. This BriC intervention addresses limitations of
previous BF interventions and other caregiver interventions
highlighted in the literature to date. BRiC takes into account
the need for brevity and the time constraints of caregivers
combined with an evidence-based writing exercise activity,
employing a mixed-methods approach and a long-term fol-
low-up period. In order to systematically examine the inter-
vention effects on caregiver well-being, BRiC will include
an array of outcome measures including BF, distress and
QoL as well as manipulation checks, that is, intervention
expectancy and feasibility. Additionally, BRiC will build on
the earlier BF research (Brand et al., 2014; Pakenham, 2005)
by harnessing the power of BF to improve caregiver health
outcomes. To this end, BRiC will serve to inform future
directions of research and clinical practice with regard to
brief psychosocial interventions for caregivers.
