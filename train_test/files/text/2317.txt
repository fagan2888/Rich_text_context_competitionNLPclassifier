Objective: To examine identification and counseling for obesity at pediatric office visits associated with
psychotropic medications.
Design and Methods: Analysis of ambulatory care visits by children 2-17 years in the National
Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys and outpatient component of the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Surveys from 2005 to 2008. Physician identification of obesity was determined using ICD-9
CM diagnostic codes.
Results: In 2005-2008, there were 38,539 pediatric ambulatory care visits weighted to represent 600
million pediatric visits nationally. Psychotropic medications were associated with 5.2% of visits. The
prevalence of overweight/obesity (BMI  85th%tile) was 15.9% for visits without psychotropic
medication, 19.4% and 16.8% for visits associated with nonobesogenic and obesogenic psychotropic
medications, respectively. Controlling for age, gender, and BMI, obesity was more likely to be identified
at visits associated with psychotropic medications (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3-8.8), among females (OR 1.6, 95%
CI 1.1-2.3) and non-Hispanics (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.4). At visits with psychotropic medications, dietary
counseling was provided at 11.4%, while blood pressure and cholesterol screening were obtained at
6.9% and 6.8% of these visits, respectively.
Conclusions: Our results indicate suboptimal identification and counseling for obesity children who are
prescribed psychotropic medications, despite their increased risk for weight gain.

Introduction
As greater numbers of children and adolescents are diagnosed with
mental health disorders in the last 10 years, the use of psychotropic
drugs in the pediatric population has increased (1-3). Many of the
medications prescribed are the newer psychotropic drugs, such as
Risperidone, and Quetiapine, oftentimes referred to as second-gener-
ation antipsychotics. Compared to the older drugs like Haldol and
Thorazine, second-generation antipsychotics boast an improved
safety profile, with fewer side effects such as tardive dyskinesia,
extra pyramidal symptoms, and hyperprolactinemia (4,5). This
advantage has led to providers prescribing antipsychotics more fre-
quently not only for psychotic conditions, but also for other behav-
ioral problems such as oppositional defiant disorder, irritability in
autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (4). In addition, several
of these newer drugs are now approved and indicated for use in the
pediatric population by the Food and Drug Administration.
A troublesome side effect of many of these medications is weight
gain (4,6-8). Children can gain as much as 4-10 kg in a 10-week
period (6). Excessive weight gain has ominous implications for the
emotional and physical health of the child. Childhood obesity is
associated with metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia,
glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hyperten-
sion (9,10). Obese children are also at increased risk for psychoso-
cial sequelae, including low self-esteem (11).
To counteract the adverse side effect of weight gain, providers are
to educate the patient on the risk of weight gain, and provide dietary
and physical activity counseling when any psychotropic medication
is initiated (12,13). These lifestyle recommendations, when adhered
to, have been shown to reduce psychotropic-induced weight gain
(12,14,15). In a 6-month medical weight management program
based on lifestyle changes alone, participants lost an average of
6 kg, with a decline of 2.1 units in BMI (15).
The increase in the use of the psychotropic medication particularly
second-generation antipsychotics, burden of obesity as a disease,
and encouraging outcome with diet and physical activity counseling
underscore the need for healthcare providers who care for these

children to screen, prevent and treat weight-related problems. Using
a national representative population of office visits, we examined
current provider practice patterns associated with screening for
obesity, as well as diet and physical activity counseling for a vulner-
able subset of children whose treatment for mental illness put them
at a higher risk to become or remain obese.
Methods
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCH) conducts two
national surveillance surveys (16,17), the National Ambulatory Med-
ical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), to track healthcare provider prac-
tices in ambulatory settings within the United States.
Study database
The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) con-
ducted annually since 1989 is an office-based survey of patient-
physician encounters. It uses multistage stratified random sampling
by geographic area, physician specialty, and patient visits within a
52-week randomized period. Nonfederally funded, office-based
physicians, principally involved with patient care, are selected
from the master lists of the American Medical Association and
American Osteopathic Association. For each physician, patient
encounters are systematically sampled from a sequential list of
patients seen in the physician's office during an assigned week.
The sampling rate varies from 20% to 100% depending on the
size of the practice.
The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NHAMCS) is conducted in emergency and outpatient departments
in nonfederal general and short stay hospitals located in the 50 states
and the District of Columbia. Clinics are eligible if they are attached
to the sample hospital and care is provided under the supervision of
a physician. Patients are randomly selected from a sample of visits
that occur during a randomly assigned 4-week reporting period. The
sampling rate employed is 1 in 20 visits or a maximum of 200
visits.
Survey instrument
For both NAMCS and NHAMCS, the unit of analysis is the patient
visit. For each visit, physicians or staff completed a one-page survey
instrument detailing patient demographics, insurance data, patient
complaint, physician diagnoses and services provided, current
over-the-counter and prescription medications, visit disposition, and
duration of visit. Up to three patient-complaints for a visit and three
physician diagnoses are coded according to the NAMCS Code and
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM), respectively.(18) A check box allows
physicians or staff to indicate when blood pressure or cholesterol
screening, diet/nutrition, and exercise counseling are performed. In
2005, the survey began collecting height and weight measures. The
survey design and estimation procedures are described in-depth
elsewhere (16,17).
Study population
We identified all office visits by patients 2-17 years between 2005
and 2008 in the NAMCS and the outpatient component of the
NHAMCS database. We excluded any visit made to emergency
departments from the sample.
Case definitions
An obesity-related visit was defined as a visit with a physician iden-
tification of overweight/obesity using the diagnostic codes, ICD-9-
CM 278.0-278.3 Overweight/obesity was defined as a BMI >85th
percentile for age and gender (19). The presence of any of the fol-
lowing obesity-related condition was classified as a cardiovascular
and metabolic (CVM) condition: (1) hyperlipidemia ICD-9 272.0-
272.5; (2) hypertension ICD-9 401.1 or 401.9 or NAMCS code
2510.0; and (3) type 2 diabetes ICD-9 stem codes 250 with fifth-
digit subclassification 0 or 2. Most of the obesity-related conditions
occurred with low frequency; thus, we were unable to examine each
comorbid condition separately.
Using the National Institute of Mental Health index of medications,
psychotropic medications were initially categorized into four catego-
ries: antimanic, antipsychotic, antidepressants, and antianxiety drugs.
Then, two authors (IUE and KK) independently subcategorized each
medication as obesogenic or nonobesogenic using side effects
reported in the extant literature and review of the 2008 Physician
Desk Reference (Table 1). Both authors resolved areas of disagree-
ment together, and input from two psychiatrists was used to settle
any remaining differences.
Reliability of data
The NCHS suggests combining the NAMCS and outpatient compo-
nent of the NHAMCS surveys when ambulatory care is assessed.
Combining both surveys allows for inclusion of select populations,
such as Medicaid, African-American, and adolescent groups with
different healthcare access patterns (20-22). The reliability criteria
for validity and generalizability of data from the NAMCS and
NHAMCS data is a minimum 30 unweighted cases and a relative
standard error <30%. We report results only when reliability criteria
for the data were met.
Statistical analysis
To obtain national estimates, we used the NCHS provided weights,
calculated from physician and visit sampling rates and adjusted for
nonresponse for each patient encounter (16,17). Statistical signifi-
cance for bivariate categorical data, for example, differences
between patient demographics, physician identification of obesity,
use of psychotropic medication, presence of cardiovascular and
metabolic conditions, counseling for diet and physical activity, were
assessed using the Chi-square test. We used logistic regression anal-
ysis to determine predictor for identification of obesity. The
independent variables in the model were age, sex, race/ethnicity,
overweight status, and obesogenic psychotropic medication.
Results
In 2005-2008, there were an estimated 38,539 pediatric ambulatory
care visits weighted to represent 600 million pediatric visits nation-
ally. At these visits, the mean age was 9 years, 49% were females
and 72.4% Caucasian. Almost half (44.2%) had private insurance
and 44% had Medicaid/State Children's Insurance Health Plan.
Psychotropic medications were associated with 5.2% of all the visits

(n ¼ 3383). Of these visits 18.8% were antidepressants, 10.4% were
antimanic drugs, 25.4% at antipsychotic drugs, 6.9% antianxiety
drugs, and 37.9% stimulants. Two or more psychotropic drugs were
reported at 27.9% of the visits, with second-generation antipsy-
chotics at 22.8% of visits.
Obesity identification and prevalence rates
The prevalence rate for overweight/obesity (BMI  85th percentile)
was 15.9% for all ambulatory visits. Table 2 summarizes the charac-
teristics of office visits based on use of psychotropic medications.
The prevalence rates for overweight/obesity were highest at visits
with nonobesogenic psychotropic medications (19.4%). Obesity was
identified as a diagnosis by the provider at 8.6% of visits with
obesogenic psychotropic medications, 6.9% of visits with nonobeso-
genic psychotropic medications, and 1.4% of visits without any
psychotropic medications. Of the visits with the BMI  85th percen-
tile, obesity was identified by the provider at 38.5% of visits with
obesogenic psychotropic medications, 29.8% of visits with nonobe-
sogenic psychotropic medications, and 15.6% of visits without any
psychotropic medications (Figure 1). At visits with two or more psy-
chotropic medications, the unadjusted odds of being overweight/
obese (BMI >85th percentile) was increased (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.8-
8.9). In a logistic regression analysis, controlling for age, gender,
and BMI, obesity was more likely to be identified at visits associ-
ated with psychotropic medications (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3-8.8), among
females (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3) and non-Hispanics (OR 1.5, 95%
CI 1.0-2.4).
Counseling pattern and rates
The frequency of diet or physical activity counseling during the
study years 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 were 0.08%, 0.05%, 0.05%,
and 0.07% respectively. Across the years, there were no statistically
significant differences in counseling rates (P ¼ 0.59). Diet counsel-
ing was provided at only 0.27% of all visits, whereas blood pressure
and cholesterol screening occurred at 36.5% and 1.2 % of visits,
respectively. For visits associated with psychotropic medications, di-
etary counseling was provided at 11.4% of the visits. Blood pressure
and cholesterol screening were obtained at 6.9% and 6.8% of these
visits, respectively. The highest rates of any counseling (0.7%)
occurred at visits where there was a psychotropic medication and
the BMI was >85th percentile (Figure 2). The rates for physical ac-
tivity counseling alone did not meet NAMCS/NHAMCS reliability
because of the extremely low unweighted numbers (<30) and, there-
fore, are not reported.

Cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity
The prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic (CVM) complica-
tions at all the visits was 0.96% (n ¼ 597). In a logistic regression
analysis controlling for age, gender, race (Table 3), the odds of a
CVM condition being identified by the provider at the visit was
higher when the subject was overweight or obese (OR 2.6, 95% CI
1.5-4.5). There was no significant association between the presence
of a CVM condition and visits with an obesogenic psychotropic
medication (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.5-5.3).
Discussion
Our results indicate suboptimal identification and counseling for
obesity at pediatric ambulatory visits associated with psychotropic
medications despite increased vulnerability for weight gain in these
children. This trend is similar to low rates of provider identification
of obesity (23) and discordant with how most physicians report they
view childhood obesity (24). In a survey of pediatricians and other
health providers, 75-93% felt childhood and adolescent obesity was
a serious condition that needed to be addressed (24).
Despite the overall low identification rates reported in our study, it
is encouraging that the odds of identifying obesity was significantly
higher at visits associated with a psychotropic medication (OR 5.2,
95% CI 3-8.8). Perhaps healthcare providers are more sensitive to
weight gain among this subset of children. Other positive predictors
for identification included female gender and non-Hispanic ethnicity.
A higher rate of physician identification for obesity has been
reported previously among females (25-27). Females may be more
likely than males to share their concerns about their weight with
their physicians, thus prompting greater identification. We did not
find increased identification of obesity at visits with blacks or His-
panics reported in other studies (25,28). It is probable that racial/eth-
nic distribution may differ depending on the pattern of prescribing
psychotropic medication, or the etiology of the weight gain, that is,
whether it is exogenous or induced by psychotropic medications.
Thus, our finding of increased identification among non-Hispanics
needs to be interpreted with caution and further analysis
recommended.
Correll and colleagues(5) have put forth a set of criteria to define
clinically significant psychotropic-induced weight gain in children
and adolescents. The criteria include (i) 5% increase in over base-
line weight in 3 months, (ii) increase in BMI Z-score of 0.5 stand-
ard deviation or more above appropriate growth, (iii) crossing into
the 95th percentile for BMI, or (iv) crossing into the 85-94th per-
centile for BMI plus one obesity related co-morbidity. For a child
to meet these criteria there has been considerable deviation from
their normal growth trajectory. The criteria align with recognized
definitions for overweight and obesity in children (19). The excess
weight gain noted with psychotropic medications is associated with
an increased risk for hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, exacerbation
or onset of diabetes, elevated triglycerides and cholesterol levels
(7,8,29-33). Other associated conditions of obesity include low self-
esteem, which increases the likelihood of high-risk behaviors that
can worsen underlying mental health conditions (11).

For children who require psychotropic medication, the excess weight
gain and the burden of disease associated with obesity signal an ur-
gency to examine provider counseling practices. When healthcare
providers prescribe psychotropic medications with known influences
on weight, the patient should receive preemptive counseling prior to
initiation and during treatment. Lifestyle counseling remains the first
line of defense for addressing excess weight gain. Although health-
care providers sometimes perceive lifestyle counseling as ineffective
(24), studies have shown healthcare providers can be effective
agents for change (34,35). Overweight adolescents who are coun-
seled by their physician report attempting weight loss strategies at
rates similar to recommendations (35). Families also look to physi-
cians as a primary resource for addressing weight concerns (36).
However, the efficacy of counseling for psychotropic-induced
weight gain in an ambulatory setting to reduce or prevent obesity in
children is largely unknown (12,14,15).
A possible barrier for lifestyle counseling at office visits is the lack
of reimbursement for obesity-related services (37), especially as
counseling for a potential side effect that is yet to occur does not
usually qualify as a stand-alone billable office visit diagnosis. When
preemptive counseling is provided at visits for medication monitor-
ing, a modifier code can be used to indicate the additional preven-
tive care provided depending on the scope of the counseling.
Alternatively, lifestyle counseling can be coded and billed under the
diagnostic code of ``abnormal weight gain'' (ICD-9 code 783.1) in
addition to the mental health diagnostic code if the child has demon-
strated weight gain because of the medication.
There are limitations to our study. The cross-sectional nature of the
study design precludes our ability to access care provided over time
to an individual patient; thus, it is conceivable that obesity or coun-
seling has been identified at a prior visit. Although the NAMCS/
NHAMCS form is completed independent of billing, our estimates
of obesity recognition and counseling may be conservative as low
reimbursement rates for the diagnosis of obesity may decrease the
likelihood of a physician coding for obesity. Despite these limita-
tions, the study has several strengths. In using a large nationally rep-
resentative sample of pediatric office visits, we offer some insight
on management of obesity in a vulnerable segment of children in
the United States. Including data from the outpatient clinics in the
NHAMCS allowed us to capture a broader spectrum of ambulatory
care visits than those that occur only in the physician's office, pro-
viding a more representative national sample.
In summary, our findings suggest poor recognition and counseling for
obesity for all children regardless of whether they are on psychotropic
medication. That healthcare providers identify obesity most often in
children on obesogenic medications is encouraging and an area for
further study. We need to investigate the challenges to instituting
preventive counseling on a consistent basis when any psychotropic
medications, especially second-generation antipsychotics are pre-
scribed for children. This is particularly relevant given diagnostic
criteria for psychotropic-induced weight gain includes children who
may not yet have a BMI above the 85th percentile, the trigger for a
diagnosis of obesity (19). Finally, this study provides national and
generalizeable baseline data on which to track physician practice pat-
terns in managing children on psychotropic medications over time.O
