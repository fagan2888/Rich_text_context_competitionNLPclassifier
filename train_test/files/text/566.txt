CONSIDERABLE evidence points to the enjoyment of
better health and quality of life among married older
adults relative to their non-married peers (e.g., Bookwala &
Fekete, 2009; Kim & McKenry, 2002; Liu & Umberson,
2008; Pienta, Hayward, & Jenkins, 2000; Umberson, Hui, &
Powers, 2009). These advantages in health and quality of
life are likely to accrue at least partially from the benefits
that marriage can bring in the form of supportive ex-
changes between spouses, ongoing companionship, and
emotional attachment (e.g., Allen, Blieszner, & Roberto,
2000; Bradbury, Fincham, & Beach, 2000; Xu & Burleson,
2004). Past research has shown that being in a better quality
marriage is directly related to superior quality of life in late
adulthood (e.g., Antonucci, Lansford, & Akiyama, 2001;
Bookwala, in press; Bookwala, 2005; Bookwala & Jacobs,
2004; Umberson,Williams, Powers, Liu, & Needham, 2006).
More importantly, in the face of stressors, a good marriage
can serve as perhaps the most important resource of sup-
port (Cutrona, 1996) by fostering responsiveness to a
loved one's needs and acts that communicate caring and
facilitate adaptive coping with stress. Several studies ac-
cordingly have confirmed that a better quality marriage can
mitigate the negative impact of late life stressors on quality
of life (Bookwala & Franks, 2005; Choi & Marks, 2006;
Tower & Kasl, 1995; Tower, Kasl, & Moritz, 1997).
The present study focuses on the impact of poor vision as
one such age-related stressor. Specifically, it examines the
role of a good marriage as a potential buffer in the adverse
consequences of poor vision in late life. Using vision assessed
both subjectively and objectively in a national probability-
based sample of adults aged 57­85 years, it examines the
extent to which different aspects of marital quality (rela-
tionship satisfaction, supportive spouse behaviors, and free
time spent with one's spouse) moderate the negative effects
of poor vision on three specific indicators of quality of life:
functional limitations, feelings of social isolation, and
depressive symptomatology. These indices are in keeping with
the World Health Organization's (1998) multidimensional
definition of quality of life that incorporates individuals'
physical and social functioning and psychological states as
key components.
Impact of Poor Vision
Vision-related problems are widely prevalent during the
late life years. Recent estimates obtained from the National
Health Interview Survey indicate that 17% of individuals
aged 65+ years reported having trouble with their vision
even with corrective glasses and lenses (Federal Interagency
Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2008). Vision-related
problems can have demonstrable adverse effects on the
lives of older adults (e.g., Crews, 1994; Federal Interagency
Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2008; Horowitz, 2004).
For example, studies have found a link between vision-related

Objectives. This study assessed the moderating role of marital quality in the effects of subjective and objective vision
on functional limitations, social isolation, and depressive symptomatology.
Method. Data from 738 married older adults drawn from a probability-based representative sample of elders residing
in the United States were used. Assessments included subjective and objective vision, marital quality variables (relation-
ship satisfaction, supportive spouse behaviors, and free time spent with one's spouse), and three aspects of quality of life
(functional limitations, social isolation, and depressive symptomatology).
Results. Moderated regression analyses found that relationship satisfaction and supportive spouse behaviors moderated
the effects of poor self-reported vision on functional limitations and depressive symptoms and the effects of poor visual
acuity on functional limitations. As hypothesized, poorer vision was unrelated to functional limitations and depressive
symptoms in more satisfying marriages but predicted higher levels of both outcomes in less satisfying marriages.
Contrary to expectations, higher levels of supportive spouse behaviors were associated with more functional limitations
in respondents who reported poorer subjective and objective vision.
Discussion. A marriage that is highly satisfying can mitigate the adverse effects of poor vision on functional limitations
and depressive symptomatology in late life. The moderating role of supportive spouse behaviors in the link between poor
vision and quality of life is less intuitive, however. Whereas relationship satisfaction may operate as a traditional buffer in
the context of poor vision, supportive spouse behaviors may increase in response to or be ineffective in this context.

problems and global measures of subjective well-being and
life satisfaction in a variety of samples. Wahl, Schilling,
Oswald, and Heyl (1999) observed that greater visual
impairment was related to lower subjective well-being in a
sample of older adults recruited through physician prac-
tices. Bourque, Leger, Pushkar, and Beland (2007) reported
that poor vision was related to lower life satisfaction in a
representative sample of older Canadians, and Reinhardt
(1996) found a similar relationship in a convenience sample
of visually impaired older adults.
In terms of more specific aspects of quality of life,
consistent with the World Health Organization's (1998)
definition of the construct, O'Donnell (2005) has described
the challenges associated with poor vision in late life to be
threefold involving functional limitations, losses in social
interactions, and increases in depressive symptomatology.
These challenges also are in keeping with the disablement
process model (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994), according to
which limitations in physical functioning and difficulty in
performing day-to-day activities are likely consequences in
the face of impairment in domains such as visual function.
Moreover, the activity restriction model (Williamson &
Christie, 2009; Williamson & Shaffer, 2000) also explains
that limitations in functioning (both physical and social)
and depressive symptomatology are likely adverse conse-
quences older adults experience in the face of late life stress-
ors, and this model is applicable to the context of poor vision
(Bookwala & Lawson, 2011). Several studies accordingly
have examined the effects of poor vision on functional levels,
social relationships, and depressive symptoms.
Perhaps the most widely examined effect of poor vision
is difficulty in the ability to carry out day-to-day physical
activities, and studies consistently have found evidence for
adverse effects (Crews, Jones, & Kim, 2006; Gunnel &
Nordholm, 1999; Horowitz, 2004; LaForge, Spector, &
Sternberg, 1992; Travis, Boerner, Reinhardt, & Horowitz,
2004). Gunnel and Nordholm (1999) found that reading,
writing, and watching television were common functional
problems associated with poor vision. In addition, mobility-
related problems, such as difficulty with moving about out-
doors, driving or using public transportation, and conducting
bank-related business were commonly reported in their
visually impaired elderly sample. Travis and colleagues
(2004) found that older adults with impaired vision reported
higher levels of difficulty with instrumental activities of
daily living (e.g., selecting/locating and identifying cloth-
ing, food items, and money; using a telephone; writing
checks; and taking medications) and that these individuals
identified these visual problems rather than other health
problems as the source of these difficulties. Crews and col-
leagues (2006) also found that older adults who reported
visual impairment were more likely to report difficulty per-
forming everyday tasks such as walking, climbing steps,
and shopping relative to their age-matched peers. In addi-
tion to contributing to limitations in physical function,
researchers propose that poor vision can have an adverse
impact on a wide range of social functioning domains
including social network size, relationship maintenance, and
social integration (O'Donnell, 2005; Reinhardt, Boerner, &
Benn, 2003; Wahl & Tesch-Romer, 2001). Accordingly,
studies have found that poor vision is correlated with lower
levels of social integration (Femia, Zarit, & Johansson, 2001),
more difficulty engaging in social relationships (Crews et al.,
2006), and higher levels of social isolation (Femia et al.,
2001). Finally, greater depressed affect is commonly associ-
ated with poor vision. Lupsakko, Mantyjarvi, Kautiainen,
and Sulkava (2002) found that higher levels of depressive
symptomatology (but not clinical depression) occurred in a
population-based sample of older adults relative to their non-
impaired peers, and Crews and colleagues reported that mild or
moderate levels of depressive symptoms are a common comor-
bid condition among elders who are visually impaired.
Numerous other studies also have found that older adults who
rated their vision to be poorer had higher levels of depressive
symptomatology in convenience and probability-based sam-
ples (e.g., Brody et al., 2001; Casten, Rovner, & Edmonds,
2001; Chou, 2008; Femia et al., 2001; Reinhardt, 1996).
Buffering Role of Marital Relationships
Despite the link that has been reported widely in the liter
ature between poor vision and quality of life outcomes,
older adults are not uniform in their experience of adverse
outcomes associated with poor vision. Social support
theory (see Cohen, 2004) suggests that good quality rela-
tionships can offer a critical resource in adapting to life
stressors; this is especially the case during the late life years
(Fuller-Iglesias, Sellars, & Antonucci, 2008; Hatch, 2005;
Ormel et al., 1997; Rowe & Kahn, 1997; Turner & Noh,
1988). According to social support theory, supportive and
satisfying relationships can enhance quality of life both
directly as well as via their buffering role in the face of per-
sonal challenges and stressors (Cohen, 2004). Specifically
in the domain of adaptation to poor vision, several studies
have documented that support from family members and
friends can play a key role (e.g., Horowitz, 2004; McIlvane &
Reinhardt, 2001; O'Donnell, 2005; Reinhardt, 1996;
Thomas & Urbano, 1993). For example, Reinhardt (1996)
found evidence for the direct contribution of support from
both friends and family (siblings, children, and other close
relatives) to lower depressive symptomatology and higher
life satisfaction among visually impaired elders. In the same
sample of visually impaired older adults, McIlvane and
Reinhardt (2001) also found evidence for the buffering role
of social support. Relative to visually impaired older adults
who reported lower levels of social support from family
and friends, those who enjoyed higher support from these
sources experienced lower depressive symptomatology.
A particular type of personal relationship that has been
largely overlooked, however, in terms of its potential capacity
VISION, MARITAL QUALITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE 607
to mitigate the adverse impact of poor vision in late life is
the resource of a close marital relationship. The spousal
relationship has been identified as playing an especially
important role in health and well-being during the late
adulthood years (e.g., Antonucci et al., 2001; Bookwala,
in press; Bookwala, 2005; Umberson et al., 2006) and can
enhance broader social functioning by fostering larger so-
cial networks (Bookwala & Fekete, 2009). When com-
pared with other types of relationships, a good quality
marriage also shows a stronger link to better psychologi-
cal well-being as assessed by negative affect, depressive
symptomatology, life satisfaction, and self-esteem (Birditt
& Antonucci, 2007; Walen & Lachman, 2000). Moreover,
we know from previous studies that the spousal relation-
ship can play an important role in modifying the impact
of life stressors on specific quality of life indicators
(Bookwala & Franks, 2005; Choi & Marks, 2006; Mancini
& Bonnano, 2006; Tower & Kasl, 1995; Tower et al., 1997).
The general pattern of findings shows that a good quality
marriage buffers the stress-outcome association in mid-
and late life. For example, Mancini and Bonnano (2006)
found that greater marital closeness moderated the nega-
tive impact of physical disability on older adults' depres-
sive symptoms, anxiety levels, and self-esteem. Likewise,
Tower and colleagues (1997) found that a close marriage
buffers the stress-related outcomes of living with a spouse
who is cognitively impaired or depressed. Bookwala and
Franks also found that greater marital disagreement exacer-
bates the link between physical disability and depressive
symptomatology.
The Current Study
The present study hypothesized that a marriage of
good quality will buffer the negative impact of poor vision
(assessed both subjectively and objectively) on quality of
life among older adults. As described earlier, poorer vision
has been found to be linked to more functional limitations,
feelings of social isolation, and depressive symptomatol-
ogy. The availability of a spouse with whom one shares a
satisfying relationship, who engages in supportive be-
haviors, and with whom recreational time is spent can be
expected to play a protective role for visually impaired
elders. Thus, a marital relationship marked by these
characteristics would buffer the negative effects of poor
vision whereby, relative to their peers in lower quality
marriages, older adults with poorer vision who were in
better marriages would experience fewer functional lim-
itations, feelings of social isolation, and symptoms of
depression. Data to test this hypothesis were drawn
from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
(NSHAP; O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, & Smith, 2009; S.
Smith et al., 2009), a survey-based study of a nationally
representative sample of older adults residing in the United
States.
Method
Sample
The sample consisted of older adults who participated in
the NSHAP (O'Muircheartaigh et al., 2009; S. Smith et al.,
2009). The NSHAP is a large-scale survey study that as-
sessed components of health, social relationships, and well-
being in older adults aged 57­85 years using face-to-face
and self-administered questionnaires. The NSHAP data
were collected in 2005­2006 for which eligible cases were
identified as part of a larger national area probability sample
of households (O'Muircheartaigh et al., 2009). The NSHAP
sample was balanced on age and gender subgroups and
oversampled African Americans and Latinos. The NSHAP
study design involved randomly selecting 50% (N = 1,506)
of its original sample (N = 3,005) to receive the objective
vision assessment. For the present study, eligible cases
included all NSHAP respondents whose vision was objec-
tively assessed and were married or living with a partner at
the time of data collection (N = 927). Of these eligible
respondents, those who had no missing data on the study
variables were included in the current analysis yielding a
final sample of 738 older adults (79.6% of the 927 NSHAP
respondents). On average, respondents were 68 years of age
(SD = 7.5), and 40.4% of the sample was female (N = 298).
The majority of the sample had at least a high school
diploma or equivalent (82.4%, N = 608) with about one fourth
of the sample holding a bachelor's degree or higher (N = 188).
Slightly more than three quarters of the sample described
their ethnic background as White (78.3%, N = 578), 9.3%
(N = 69) as Black, 9.6% (N = 71) as Hispanic non-Black,
and 2.7% (N = 20) as other. All respondents were married
(N = 715, 96.9%) or living with their partner (N = 23, 3.1%).
(In the remainder of the document, the term spouse is used
to refer collectively to the spouse and cohabiting partner.)
Measures
Vision.--Self-reported vision (subjective vision) was
assessed in the NSHAP using a single-item measure with a
5-point rating scale (Schumm et al., 2009). Self-report single-
item measures of vision have been used successfully in other
studies such as the Berlin Aging Study (J. Smith, Fleeson,
Geiselmann, Settersten, & Kunzmann, 1999) and the Canadian
Aging in the Community Study (see Bourque et al., 2007).
NSHAP respondents were asked to rate their eyesight
using the item "With your glasses or contact lenses if you
wear them, is your eyesight poor, fair, good, very good, or
excellent?" Responses were recoded such that higher
scores represented poorer self-reported vision (M = 2.43,
SD = 0.99). Slightly less than half the sample (N = 340,
46%) rated their own vision to be poor, fair, or good. The
remaining respondents rated their vision to be very good or
excellent (N = 398, 53.9%). Visual acuity (objective vision)
was assessed in both eyes together at a distance of 3 m using
BOOKWALA
608
a chart with Sloan optotypes manufactured by Precision
Vision (catalog number 2104; Schumm et al., 2009).
NSHAP interviewers were trained to follow a detailed pro-
tocol to ensure consistent distance from the chart (via use of
a premeasured string laid out on the floor), line of sight (the
interviewer seated the respondent and held the chart at the
respondent's eye level), and lighting (sufficient light for
reading with low glare or strong backlighting). Respondents
who normally wore glasses or contact lenses for driving or
distance vision were instructed to wear them during the test
and asked to begin reading the smallest discernible line.
Success or not on this task resulted in the respondent being
instructed to read the successive line directly below or
above the just-read line, respectively, until the smallest
discernible line successfully read was determined. Perfor-
mance on the visual acuity test was coded on a continuum
using standard guidelines (Schumm et al., 2009), whereby
20/20 vision or better was coded as "normal or better" vision,
between 20/40 and 20/20 was coded as "good" vision,
between approximately 20/60 and 20/40 was coded as
"moderately decreased" vision, and worse than 20/60 was
coded as "poor" vision. Respondents who were unable to
read the largest line on the Sloan chart at 3 m represented
visual acuity worse than 20/200 (N = 4); these individuals
were coded to have a score of 20/200 or poor vision. Scores
in the sample ranged from normal or better (0) to poor (3)
(M = 1.02, SD = 0.70). Based on their performance on the
visual acuity test, 18.8% (N = 139) had normal or better vi-
sion, almost two thirds had good vision (64.6%, N = 477),
12.1% (N = 89) had moderately decreased vision, and 4.5%
(N = 33) scored in the poor vision range.
Marital quality.--The present study used NSHAP assess-
ments of three domains of marital quality: relationship
satisfaction, supportive spouse behaviors, and free time
spent with one's spouse. Marital researchers have under-
scored the importance of measuring different domains of
marital quality (e.g., Bradbury, 1995; Bradbury et al., 2000),
and prior research shows that different aspects of marriage
have differential relationships to physical and mental health
indicators (e.g., Bookwala, 2005; Bookwala & Franks,
2005; Bookwala & Jacobs, 2004; Umberson et al., 2006).
The three aspects of marital relationships were assessed via
six items available in the NSHAP data. [The six marital
quality items were factor analyzed using principal compo-
nents analysis with varimax (orthogonal) rotation. A three-
factor extraction was requested representing the three
domains. The results of the orthogonal rotation yielded an
interpretable three-factor solution that collectively ex-
plained 74.624% of the variance for the set of six variables
(34.238% explained by Factor 1, 23.574% by Factor 2, and
16.812% by Factor 3) with the rotated factors obtaining
eigenvalues ranging from 1.01 to 2.054. Three items loaded
on Factor 1 that was labeled relationship satisfaction: items
measuring relationship happiness (factor loading = .692);
emotional satisfaction (factor loading = .855); and physical
pleasure (factor loading = .864). Two items loaded on Factor
2, labeled supportive spouse behaviors: items measuring fre-
quency of relying on the spouse (factor loading = .800)
and opening up to the spouse (factor loading = .806). Factor
3, labeled free time spent with the spouse, had a single item
load on that assessed preference for spending free time (fac-
tor loading = .984). All items loaded on a single factor and
are described in detail below.] Relationship satisfaction was
assessed by respondents rating (a) their relationship with
their spouse "taking all things together" using a 7-point
scale ranging from 1 = very unhappy to 7 = very happy, (b)
how physically pleasurable they considered the relationship
to be with the spouse (5-point scale ranging from 0 = not at
all to 4 = extremely), and (c) how emotionally satisfying
they found the relationship to be (5-point scale ranging
from 0 = not at all to 4 = extremely). Mean responses were
computed across the three items such that higher scores
reflected greater relationship satisfaction (M = 4.12, SD
= 0.82; Cronbach's a = .75). Supportive spouse behaviors
was measured using two items where respondents rated
how often they could rely on their spouse and open up to
their spouse. Responses were made using a 3-point scale
ranging from 1 = hardly ever (or never) to 3 = often. Mean
responses across the two items were computed such that
higher scores represented more supportive spouse behaviors
(M = 2.79, SD = 0.38). Free time spent with one's spouse
was assessed using a single item that asked if the respondent
liked to spend free time doing things together with their
spouse or doing things separately. Responses made on a
3-point scale (1 = together, 2 = some together and some dif-
ferent, and 3 = different/separate things) were dichotomized
in keeping with NSHAP-based research that has used this
variable (Brown & Kawamura, 2011); responses were dum-
my-coded into 0 (responses of some together and some dif-
ferent and different/separate things) or 1 (together).
Almost 52% (51.8%, N = 382) indicated that they liked to
spend free time doing things together with their spouse,
whereas the remaining responded that they liked to do some
things together and some different or that they liked to do
different things (48.2%, N = 356).
Functional limitations was assessed using nine items on
which respondents reported how much difficulty they had
related to walking (e.g., walking a street block, walking
across a room), self-care activities (e.g., dressing, eating,
using the toilet, bathing or showering, getting in and out of
bed), and driving (e.g., driving during the day, driving at
night). Responses were made on a 4-point scale using codes
ranging from 1 to 4 (no difficulty, some difficulty, much
difficulty, and unable to do). Activities that had never been
performed were scored as no difficulty; for the driving
items, if respondents indicated that they no longer drove,
the response was coded as unable to do. Responses to the
nine items were summed such that higher scores repre-
sented greater difficulty in performing daily functions (or
VISION, MARITAL QUALITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE 609
limitations, feelings of social isolation, and depressive
symptoms. The quality of older adults' marital relationship
was uncorrelated with objectively assessed vision, whereas
better self-rated vision was related to higher relationship
satisfaction and more supportive spouse behaviors.
Baron and Kenny's (1986) approach for testing moderator
models was used to assess the protective role of marital
quality in the link between poorer vision and the three indi-
cators of quality of life, functional limitations, feelings of
social isolation, and depressive symptomatology. Two sepa-
rate moderated regression models were tested for each
indicator of quality of life using the SPSS 17.0 statistical
software package; one model tested the moderating role of
marital quality in the effects of self-reported (subjective)
vision controlling for visual acuity (objective vision) and
the second tested the same in the effects of objective vision
controlling for subjective vision. Each model introduced
sociodemographic (control) variables on Step 1, self-reported
vision, visual acuity, and marital quality factors on Step 2,
and the interaction of each marital quality variable and
either self-reported vision or objective vision on Step 3.
To minimize multicollinearity, predictor variables were
centered before they were multiplied (Judd & McClelland,
1989). A significant interaction term, indicating that marital
quality moderates the effects of vision on the criterion vari-
able (Baron & Kenny, 1986), was decomposed such that
simple slopes were computed and tested for the relationship
between vision and the quality of life indicator for respon-
dents scoring 1 SD above and below the mean on the mod-
erating marital quality variable (Aiken & West, 1991).
Table 2 contains the results of the moderated regression
models. It presents the findings separately for the moder-
ating role of marital quality in the effects of self-reported
vision and visual acuity. The results for Step 1 (examining
the role of sociodemographic variables) and Step 2 (examin-
ing the direct role of the vision and marital quality variables)
were identical across the models focusing on self-reported
vision and visual acuity; the results for Step 3 (the test of
moderation) varied across these models. Step 2 indicates
that vision assessments and marital quality variables as a set
more functional limitations; M = 10.66, SD = 3.01). The
9-item scale was found to be internally consistent (Cronbach's
a = .80).
Feelings of social isolation were assessed using three
items (how often do you feel isolated from others, that you
lack companionship, and feel left out?) adapted from the
UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980).
Similar items were used by Femia and colleagues (2001) in
their study of outcomes associated with vision impairment
to measure feelings of social isolation in older adults.
Responses to these items were made using a 3-point scale
ranging from 1 = hardly ever or never to 3 = often, and
scores were summed such that higher scores represented
more feelings of social isolation (M = 3.78, SD = 1.22;
Cronbach's a = .80).
Depressive symptomatology was measured using an 11-
item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies­
Depression scale (Radloff, 1977) that assesses the severity
of depressive symptoms over a 1-week recall period. Items
(e.g., "I could not `get going'" and "I felt that everything
I did was an effort") were answered on a 4-point scale rang-
ing from 0 = rarely/none of the time to 3 = most of the time.
Item responses were summed with higher scores reflecting
more symptoms of depression (M = 4.93, SD = 4.88); the
scale was internally consistent (Cronbach's a = .79).
Control variables.--Sociodemographic variables were
measured in the NSHAP using standard self-report items.
These included age (in years), gender (1 = male, 2 = female),
education (1 = less than high school, 2 = high school diploma
or equivalent, 3 = some college/vocational education, and
4 = college education or higher), and ethnic background
(coded as a dichotomous variable, 1 = White vs. 2 =
non-White). These variables were used as covariates in the
moderated regression models.
Results
Zero-order correlations between major study variables
are listed in Table 1. A small but statistically significant
correlation was obtained between self-reported vision and
performance on the visual acuity test (r = .24, p < .001). As
expected, respondents who rated their vision to be poorer
also reported greater functional limitations, feelings of
social isolation, and depressive symptomatology. Those
whose visual acuity was objectively assessed to be poorer
also reported more functional limitations and symptoms of
depression. The three marital quality domains (relationship
satisfaction, supportive spouse behaviors, and free time
spent with the spouse) were correlated with each other in
the expected direction; these correlation coefficients ranged
from .17 to .45, indicating that these factors assessed related
but distinct aspects of marital quality (shared variance rang-
ing from .030 to .203). In addition, consistent with existing
research, poorer marital quality was related to more functional

Notes: Higher scores represent poorer vision; more relationship satisfaction, more supportive spouse behaviors, and preference for free time spent doing
things with the spouse; more functional limitations, feelings of social isolation, and depressive symptoms. Results for Steps 1 and 2 are identical for the
models testing moderation of marital quality for the effects of self-reported vision and visual acuity. On Step 1, being female was associated with more functional
limitations, feelings of social isolation, and symptoms of depression; being older and being less educated were associated with more functional limitations
and symptoms of depression, whereas being of non-Caucasian race/ethnicity was predictive of more feelings of social isolation. Time w/spouse = free time

explained a significant proportion of variance in functional
limitations, DF(5,728) = 9.13, p < .001, DR2 = .053, feelings
of social isolation, DF(5,728) = 25.06, p < .001, DR2 = .142,
and depressive symptomatology, DF(5,728) = 22.79, p <
.001, DR2 = .127. After controlling for the role of sociode-
mographic variables, poorer self-reported vision was
independently associated with more functional limitations,
feelings of social isolation, and depressive symptomatology
and poorer visual acuity predicted more functional limita-
tions. Among the marital quality variables, lower relationship
satisfaction predicted more feelings of social isolation and
symptoms of depression. [The moderated regression models
were retested using two health-related variables as additional
covariates on Step 1, scores on a standard single item measur-
ing self-rated health and a count of 17 health conditions for
which the respondent had received physician diagnoses
(e.g., arthritis, ulcers, emphysema). The addition of these
health variables to the regression models did not significantly
alter the results of the original models that are provided in
Table 2, and thus, the results for the original models are pre-
sented. The improvement in model fit yielded by the test of the
moderator model focusing on subjective and objective vision
(Steps 3A and 3B) remained statistically significant. Likewise,
all but one interaction term in Steps 3A and 3B remained
statistically significant (the interaction of Objective Vision ×
Spouse Supportive Behaviors when predicting functional limi-
tations dropped to marginal statistical significance at p < .08).
These results can be obtained from the author upon request.]
Moderation of the Effects of Self-reported Vision
(Subjective Vision)
Step 3A presents the results for the test of marital quality
as a moderator of the effects of poorer self-reported vision.
Supporting the moderation hypothesis, the addition of the
interaction terms between the marital quality variables and
self-reported vision collectively resulted in a significant
improvement in model fit when predicting functional limi-
tations, DF(3,725) = 5.78, p < .001, DR2 = .020, and depres-
sive symptoms, DF(3,725) = 4.11, p < .01, DR2 =.014; the
test of the moderator model was not significant for feelings
of social isolation. A significant interaction of Relationship
Satisfaction × Self-reported Vision indicated that higher
relationship satisfaction buffered the effects of self-reported
vision on functional limitations (B = -0.51, b = -.14, t =
-3.80, p < .001) and depressive symptomatology (B =
-0.71, b = -.12, t = -3.35, p = .001). The simple slopes
analysis showed that for those with low levels of rela-
tionship satisfaction (1 SD below the mean), poorer self-
reported vision predicted significantly more functional
limitations (B = 0.86, t = 4.95, p < .001). For those with high
levels of relationship satisfaction (1 SD above the mean),
however, self-reported vision was unrelated to functional
limitations (B = 0.03, t = 0.15, p = n.s.). Likewise, the sim-
ple slopes analysis in the case of depressive symptoms
showed that poorer self-reported vision predicted greater
depressive symptomatology when relationship satisfaction
was low (B = 1.57, t = 5.62, p < .001), but poor vision was
unrelated to symptoms of depression for high relationship
satisfaction (B = 0.40, t = 1.28, p = n.s.). Figure 1a and b
graphically presents the simple slopes for predicting func-
tional limitations and depressive symptoms, respectively,
based on poor versus good self-reported vision (plotted at ± 1
SD around the mean) for those with low and high relationship
satisfaction (computed at ± 1 SD around the mean).
Step 3A in Table 2 also indicates that supportive spouse
behaviors moderated the link between self-reported vision
and functional limitations (B = 1.00, b = .11, t = 2.86, p <
.01). Contrary to expectations, however, decomposition of
the interaction term showed that poorer self-reported vision
was unrelated to functional limitations at low levels of
supportive spouse behaviors (B = 0.06, t = 0.31, p = n.s.),
whereas at high levels, poorer self-reported vision was as-
sociated with more functional limitations (B = 0.83, t =
4.09, p < .001; see Figure 1c).
Moderation of the Effects of Visual Acuity (Objective Vision)
Compared with the results with self-reported vision, Step
3B in Table 2 shows weaker yet statistically significant sup-
port for marital quality as a moderator of the effects of
visual acuity on functional limitations, DF(3,725) = 2.68,
p < .05, DR2 = .009, and depressive symptomatology,
DF(3,725) = 2.73, p < .05, DR2 = .009. As seen with self-
reported vision, relationship satisfaction served to sig-
nificantly buffer the impact of visual acuity on functional
limitations (B = -0.49, b = -.09, t = -2.40, p < .05). The
simple slopes analysis showed that, as expected, visual acuity
was unrelated to functional limitations when relationship
satisfaction was high (B = -0.09, t = -0.29, p = n.s.), but poor
visual acuity significantly predicted more functional limita-
tions when relationship satisfaction was low (B = 0.72, t =
2.54, p < .01). Figure 2a presents the simple slopes predicting
functional limitations from visual acuity for high versus low
relationship satisfaction (±1 SD around the mean) plotted
at ±1 SD above and below the mean of visual acuity.
Supportive spouse behaviors also moderated the effects
of visual acuity on functional limitations and depressive
symptoms (B = 0.88, b = .07, t = 2.01, p < .05 and B = 1.79,
b = .09, t = 2.57, p < .01, respectively, for the interaction
terms).Again parallel to the findings seen with self-reported
vision, poorer visual acuity was unrelated to functional
limitations for low supportive spouse behaviors (1 SD
below the mean) but was associated with more functional
limitations for high levels (1 SD above the mean) of sup-
portive spouse behaviors (B = -0.02, t = -0.08, p = n.s. and
B = 0.65, t = 2.21, p < .01, respectively; see Figure 2b). The
simple slopes analysis for depressive symptoms, however,
yielded nonsignificant slopes predicting depressive symp-
toms from visual acuity for both high and low scores on

supportive spouse behaviors (B = -0.66, t = -1.40, p = n.s.
and B = 0.71, t = 1.52, p = n.s., respectively).
Discussion
This study examined the moderating role played by
marital quality in the path from visual function--assessed
subjectively and objectively--to functional limitations,
feelings of social isolation, and depressive symptomatol-
ogy in a probability-based sample of older adults. Although
previous studies have examined the buffering role of support
from friends and family in the link between visual impair-
ment and well-being in elders (e.g., McIlvane & Reinhardt,
2001), no study could be located that had examined the
capacity of a good marriage to play such a mitigating role.
And yet, the spousal relationship remains a key social tie in
the late adulthood years (e.g., Antonucci et al., 2001), and
one that is close or marked by better quality has been found
to be an important resource for older adults (e.g., Bookwala,
2005; Bookwala & Franks, 2005; Bookwala & Jacobs, 2004;
Umberson et al., 2006). The present study hypothesized that
a marriage of good quality will buffer the negative impact of
poor vision on older adults' quality of life.
Preliminary analyses showed that poorer self-reported
vision was consistently related to more functional limitations,
feelings of social isolation, and depressive symptomatology
and that poorer visual acuity was related to more functional
limitations. This pattern of findings is consistent with other
studies that have examined links to quality of life from self-
rated visual function (e.g., Horowitz, 2004; Reinhardt, 1996)
and objective assessments of distance vision (Jang et al.,
2003). Consistent with study expectations and findings from
other studies (e.g., Antonucci et al., 2001; Bookwala &
Franks, 2005; Bookwala & Jacobs, 2004; Umberson et al.,
2006), the present study also found that better marital quality,
specifically a more satisfying marital relationship, predicted
better quality of life in general.
Most central to the study's goals was the test of the moder-
ating role of a good marriage in the link from vision to quality
of life. The results showed that higher marital satisfaction
was a strong buffer of the effects of poorer self-reported
vision on functional limitations and depressive symptomatol-
ogy and a weaker but significant moderator of the effects of
lower visual acuity on functional limitations. These findings
show that a more satisfying marriage may be a key resource
in older adults' adaptation to poor visual function. We know
from past research that a good spousal relationship can play a
valuable role in enhancing quality of life (e.g.,Antonucci et al.,
2001; Bookwala & Jacobs, 2004; Walen & Lachman, 2000)
and that a good quality marriage can mitigate the adverse
effects of mid- and late life stressors such as physical disabil-
ity or living with a cognitively impaired or depressed spouse
(e.g., Bookwala & Franks, 2005; Mancini & Bonnano, 2006;
Tower & Kasl, 1995; Tower et al., 1997). The present results
extend these findings to the domain of visual function to
show that a more satisfying marriage buffers the link between
poor vision and quality of life in late adulthood.
Not all marital quality indicators, however, served to buf-
fer the link from poor vision to better quality of life. Leisure
or recreational time spent with one's spouse did not moder-
ate the negative role of poor vision in functional limitations,
feelings of social isolation, and symptoms of depression.
Moreover, supportive spouse behaviors moderated the link
between poor vision and functional limitations in the direc-
tion opposite from that expected. More supportive spouse

behaviors were associated with higher functional limitations
in the case of poor vision (subjective and objective). A
plausible explanation for this finding is that supportive be-
haviors from one's spouse may be a response to functional
limitations that accompany poorer visual ability such that
older adults with poorer vision (and thus, more functional
limitations) may be more likely to receive more supportive
behaviors from their spouse. Some supporting evidence
for this explanation is offered by Reinhardt and colleagues
(2003) who found that more functional disability was linked
to higher support from family members in a sample of visu-
ally impaired elders. They posit that interactions of family
members are responsive in nature and are likely to be in-
creased in times of need as in the case of a spouse who re-
ports high visual impairment and functional limitations. It
also is plausible, however, that heightened support from the
spouse is overprotective or solicitous in nature. Studies of
visually impaired elders have shown that overprotection or
solicitous support can compromise adaptation and quality of
life (e.g., Cimarolli & Boerner, 2005; Cimarolli, Reinhardt,
& Horowitz, 2006). Thus, solicitous support may result in
visually impaired elders being prevented by the spouse from
carrying out day-to-day activities and thereby them experi-
encing more functional limitations. Finally, Antonucci and
Akiyama (1995) pointed out that interpersonal relation-
ships may exacerbate the effects of stressors when the sup-
port that is provided is ineffective. The supportive behaviors
assessed in the NSHAP pertained to emotionally supportive
behaviors rather than to material or instrumental support. It
is plausible that emotionally supportive behaviors are inef-
fective in the context of poor vision and thus may not buffer
or may even exacerbate difficulties in day-to-day function. It
is essential that future studies undertake a more nuanced
analysis of the role of different types of supportive behaviors
(e.g., emotional support vs. instrumental support vs. solici-
tous support) in buffering versus exacerbating the effects
of poor vision on functional limitations.
A noteworthy characteristic of the present findings is
that the moderator models for self-reported vision con-
trolled for the direct effects of visual acuity and vice versa.
This approach is more rigorous because it examines the
simultaneous effects of both perceived visual function and
objective visual acuity. In addition, it takes into account
discrepancies between individuals' subjective assessments
of their visual function and objective performance scores.
An examination of the match between the two vision as-
sessments (not reported earlier) showed that 91 respon-
dents whose visual acuity fell in the moderately decreased
to poor range rated their vision to be good to excellent and
an additional 63 respondents whose visual acuity fell in the
normal to good range rated their vision as fair or poor.
Thus, approximately one fifth of the sample showed some
discordance between their self-reported and objectively as-
sessed vision. This is in keeping with the small (albeit sig-
nificant)correlation(r=.24)obtainedbetweenself-reported
vision and performance on the visual acuity test. Such dis-
cordance between subjective and objective assessments of
vision has been reported in earlier research (Fors,
Thorslund, & Parker, 2006) and thus including both assess-
ments when available in statistical models is desirable. In-
cluding both subjective and objective measures of vision
also can offer complementary information on visual ability
and may serve to counter the limitations of the other
(Horowitz, 2004). Horowitz (2004) pointed out that a per-
formance-based measure of visual acuity does not assess
impairments that may be experienced due to visual field,
contrast sensitivity, and depth perception problems and
thus can offer an objective but more exclusive estimate of
visual problems. In contrast, she noted that a self-reported
measure of visual ability is likely to capture more global
evaluations of vision including trouble seeing, difficulty
reading newspaper print, and difficulty seeing a familiar
person across a room's length that provide insight into the
day-to-day implications of poor vision. As such, self-re-
ported data on visual function are likely to offer a subjec-
tive but more inclusive estimate of visual problems. Future
research may gain further by assessing even more specific
aspects of visual function objectively (e.g., impairment in
depth perception, extreme contrast or brightness sensitivity
in addition to visual acuity as assessed in NSHAP) and
subjectively (e.g., self-reported trouble with reading news-
paper print and recognizing people at a small distance in

addition to the global assessment of one's vision as as-
sessed in NSHAP) in the study of the effects of vision on
quality of life and the capacity of a good marriage to alter
these effects.
In sum, this study offers insight into the role of marital
quality in protecting older adults from the negative role of
vision impairment in functional limitations, feelings of
social isolation, and depressive symptomatology. It does so
via data from a representative sample of community-residing
older adults in the United States with varying levels of
visual function who participated in the NSHAP (S. Smith
et al., 2009). The NSHAP is a rich source of data on
the lives of older adults that includes assessments of several
aspects of marital and similar partnered relationships, subjective
and objective dimensions of visual function, and multiple
dimensions of quality of life. These strengths notwithstanding,
it is important to note the study's limitations. First, the data are
cross-sectional in nature and, as such, preclude unambiguous
causal interpretations of relationships. For example, one
could argue for the moderating role of quality of life in the
link from vision impairment to marital quality. However,
there is strong theoretical and empirical evidence for a reli-
able link from worse visual function to poorer quality of
life (e.g., Bourque et al., 2007; Horowitz, 2004), and the
stress-buffering hypothesis of social support (Cohen, 2004)
provides a viable theoretical argument for treating the spou-
sal relationship as the moderator in this link. Other studies
demonstrating the moderating role of marital quality in the
face of a diverse set of stressors experienced in late life
(e.g., Bookwala, 2005; Bookwala & Franks, 2005; Tower &
Kasl, 1995) further strengthen the rationale for treating the
spousal relationship as a moderator in the well-established
link between vision impairment and quality of life in late
adulthood. Another limitation tied to the cross-sectional na-
ture of the data is that the present study cannot speak to the
issue of vision loss because prior levels of visual function in
the sample are unknown. As such, it is not possible to assess
the extent to which deterioration in vision plays a role in
quality of life and the extent to which marital quality mod-
erates the impact of such deterioration. As future waves of
the NSHAP become available, however, it will be possible
to assess these relationships longitudinally. Despite the cross-
sectional nature of the data, the present study makes impor-
tant and novel contributions to our understanding of the
linkages among vision, marital quality, and quality of late
life. It also adds to the growing literature on the protective
role that a marriage of good quality can play in the overall
promotion of health and well-being as individuals age.
