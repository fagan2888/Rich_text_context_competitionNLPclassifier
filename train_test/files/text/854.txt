Publicly Subsidized
Health Insurance:
A Typology Of State
Approaches
Which state health insurance strategies are most successful in
covering low-income Americans?
by Shruti Rajan
ABSTRACT: Using information from case studies, published documents, and
the Current Population Survey, this paper describes and classifies state ap-
proaches to providing health insurance to low-income populations (as of 1997).
It examines the link between the scope of state efforts and uninsurance rates
for low-income populations. Findings indicate that the breadth of state policies
contributes to differences in insurance coverage for low-income persons across
states.
Employer-sponsored health insurance is the corner-
stone of the U.S. health insurance system for the nonelderly
population. Nearly 160 million children and nonelderly adults
(66 percent) were covered by it in 1995.1 Reliance on a voluntary
system, however, inherently leaves a sizable gap in health insurance
coverage: Persons without a connection to the workforce, and even
many who are linked to the workforce, may not have access to
affordable health insurance or may choose not to buy it. Nationwide,
thirty-six million persons were uninsured in 1995.2
The rate of uninsurance varies greatly across states, from a low of
7.2 percent in Tennessee to a high of 25.7 percent in New Mexico.
States have undertaken a number of strategies for addressing the
needs of the uninsured.3 This paper focuses on publicly funded
health insurance programs.4 States have used three main types of
government-subsidized health insurance programs--Medicaid,
General Assistance (GA) medical care, and other state-subsidized
programs--to provide health insurance to low-income populations.
Medicaid covered thirty-five million persons at a cost of $151
billion in 1995.5 With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA)
of 1997, another federal/state program, the State Children's Health

Insurance Program (CHIP), was created to provide subsidized
health insurance to low-income children. Several states also have
used GA programs to provide health insurance or have created state-
subsidized health insurance programs to serve persons who are in-
eligible for Medicaid.
This paper examines the approaches states have taken in using
these programs to cover the uninsured and the relationship between
states' approaches and their uninsurance rates. As part of the As-
sessing the New Federalism (ANF) project, this research focuses on
thirteen states: Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Massachu-
setts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York,
Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.6 The ANF project is a large,
multiyear research effort undertaken by the Urban Institute to moni-
tor and analyze health care and social policies at the state level. This
paper draws on information collected through in-depth case studies
in the ANF states in late 1996 and early 1997, as well as on published
documents. Unless otherwise noted, specific information on state
programs is drawn from the case studies. Data from the March 1996
and 1995 Supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS) are
used to examine the composition of health insurance coverage na-
tionally and across states.
Public Support For Health Insurance
Ultimately, the generosity of a state's approach is a function of how
the state uses its subsidized programs to provide coverage to its
low-income population. Before discussing the specific ways in
which states have structured these programs, I present a brief de-
scription of each type of program.
n Medicaid. Most prominent is the Medicaid program, a joint
federal/state entitlement program that provides health insurance for
certain low-income populations. Medicaid is administered at the
state level, but responsibility for program funding and for setting
program policy is shared by the federal and state governments.
States receive a federal financial match for their Medicaid expen-
ditures. The federal match is adjusted to account for a state's fiscal
capacity and ranges from 50 percent in states with higher capacity,
such as New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, to 79 percent in
states with relatively low capacity, such as Mississippi. Federal fi-
nancial participation makes expansion of Medicaid eligibility ap-
pealing to states relative to expanding health insurance programs
that are funded by state and local dollars.
States make many eligibility decisions within federal guidelines.
Federal law requires states to provide Medicaid to three major
populations. The largest group (56 percent of Medicaid enrollees in

1995) is made up of persons who receive cash assistance through
either Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supple-
mental Security Income (SSI).7 The second mandatory eligibility
population, the "poverty-related" group, includes children up to age
six and pregnant women with family incomes below 133 percent of
the federal poverty line, as well as children under age nineteen with
family incomes below the federal poverty level. Finally, the Medic-
aid program pays Medicare cost-sharing amounts on behalf of cer-
tain low-income Medicare beneficiaries.8
States may extend coverage to additional populations via "op-
tional" Medicaid coverage rules. First, certain medically needy indi-
viduals may qualify for Medicaid. As of this writing, thirty-six states
had such programs. Second, states may broaden poverty-related
Medicaid coverage for pregnant women and for children under age
one to as high as 185 percent of the federal poverty level. Twenty-
eight states had exercised this option by 1996.9 In addition, through
the 1902(r)(2) statute, states may disregard income and resources
above the established limits for pregnant women, children under age
nineteen, and qualified Medicare beneficiaries (QMBs). This statute
has been particularly important in raising eligibility standards for
children age six and older; twelve states used this option in 1996.10
Finally, states may set a special income standard for institutional-
ized persons. This standard may not exceed 300 percent of the basic
SSI benefit.
States also may broaden Medicaid eligibility through Section 1115
waivers, which have grown increasingly popular among states since
1993. Some states have broadened eligibility to all uninsured persons
with incomes below a certain level. Other states have leveraged federal
matching funds by using Section 1115 waivers to extend Medicaid
coverage to participants in GA and other state-subsidized programs.
n General Assistance. State GA programs provide cash or
in-kind assistance primarily to temporarily disabled, low-income
persons who do not qualify for federal assistance programs, such as
AFDC (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families [TANF] as of
1997), SSI, or Medicaid. Of the forty-two states with GA programs,
thirty-two provide both medical and cash assistance.11 Although the
amount of cash or in-kind assistance offered by GA programs is
generally low, medical coverage under such programs can be gener-
ous and in many instances is comparable to Medicaid coverage.
Despite their significance to the safety net, the recession and sub-
sequent state budget reductions in the early 1990s caused states to
scale back GA spending, according to one report.12
n Other state-subsidized programs. Freedom from federal
oversight and mandates has made state-subsidized programs in-

creasingly attractive to state policymakers.13 Fourteen states had
established state-subsidized programs as of 1996.14 Many of these
programs target uninsured children, and several have expanded eli-
gibility over the years to cover broader uninsured populations, such
as low-income working adults without access to insurance.
These state programs depart from the Medicaid model by offering
coverage to a wide range of populations (including childless adults),
limiting service coverage and enrollment levels, and imposing benefi-
ciary cost sharing. In fact, many states have designed their programs
to promote self-sufficiency and avoid the "welfare stigma" often asso-
ciated with Medicaid and GA. A major attraction of these programs
is that they do not have to be open-ended entitlement programs.
Some states have used Section 1115 demonstrations to leverage
Medicaid federal matching funds for their programs. A few states have
integrated Medicaid, GA, and state-subsidized programs into a single
program under these demonstrations. Other states have kept their
state-subsidized programs separate from Medicaid but have negoti-
ated a federal financial match for state spending on participants who
would be eligible for Medicaid under a 1902(r)(2) expansion.
A Typology Of States' Health Insurance Systems
States' publicly supported health insurance programs can be classi-
fied into three broad coverage categories (comprehensive, moderate,
and limited). The "comprehensive" category includes states that tend
to maximize Medicaid eligibility standards and thus take advantage
of federal financial participation. These states also use state funds to
finance insurance coverage through GA medical care, state-subsi-
dized programs, or both. The "moderate" category includes states that
also tend to maximize federal financial participation and implement
broad Medicaid eligibility standards but do little to provide insurance
coverage using only their own funds. Finally, the "limited" category
includes states that have extended Medicaid coverage little beyond
federal requirements and thus have not taken advantage of the federal
matching funds (despite the high federal matching rate in many of
these states). In addition, these states typically have not used state or
local monies to support health insurance programs for the uninsured.
Each state's approach was classified based on the scope of the
state's Medicaid eligibility standards and the extent of coverage
provided through its GA medical care and state-subsidized pro-
"`Comprehensive' states tendto maximize Medicaid eligibility stand-
ards and thus take advantage of federal financial participation."

grams. The generosity of Medicaid eligibility was assessed by con-
sidering, among other factors, AFDC income limits, the extent of
expansion of eligibility beyond mandatory populations, and the per-
centage of low-income (below 200 percent of poverty) populations
eligible for Medicaid.15 The existence and size (in terms of enroll-
ment) of a GA medical care and/or another state-subsidized health
insurance program also were taken into account. A comparison of
the relative sizes of the programs was based on the ratio of enrollees
(from each program) to uninsured persons in a state.16

nesota, New York, and Washington--fall into the "comprehensive"
category (Exhibit 1). These states traditionally have taken a progres-

sive approach toward their health care systems. All four have broad-
based Medicaid eligibility and relatively far-reaching GA and state-
subsidized insurance programs. Their commitment to creating a
strong health care system is evident in other efforts, including the
large uncompensated care pools to fund care for the uninsured in
New York and Massachusetts, extensive insurance market reforms
in New York, and the comprehensive health care reform legislation
that was passed and implemented during the early 1990s in Minne-
sota, Massachusetts, and Washington.
Massachusetts. Massachusetts has developed a strong publicly
funded health insurance system. It has set relatively high AFDC
income limits and Medicaid coverage that extends beyond man-
dated levels to infants and pregnant women. The state operates a
GA medical care program as well as three state-subsidized pro-
grams serving distinct target populations. The first of these, the
Children's Medical Security Plan, offers coverage to all uninsured
children; children from families with incomes below 200 percent of
poverty receive subsidies. A second program, the Medical Security
Plan, serves adults who have incomes up to 400 percent of the
federal poverty line and are receiving state and federal unemploy-
ment benefits. The third program, CommonHealth, provides health
insurance to working adults with disabilities and to children with
disabilities who are ineligible for Medicaid. As of April 1997 the
Children's Medical Security Plan was serving 33,000 children, the
Medical Security Plan had 16,700 participants, and CommonHealth
had about 3,500 enrollees.
Under its Section 1115 waiver program, the state plans to inte-
grate the CommonHealth and Medical Security Plan into Medicaid.
The structure of these programs would remain the same, but the
state would begin to receive a federal financial match for program
outlays. The demonstration also will expand Medicaid coverage to
children with family incomes below 200 percent of poverty.
Minnesota. Minnesota has a long history of providing generous
health care benefits to the poor. The state supports a comprehensive
Medicaid program with broad service coverage and liberal eligibility
standards. Through optional eligibility rules, Minnesota provides
Medicaid coverage to children under age twenty-one and pregnant
women with family incomes up to 275 percent of poverty. The state
has been equally progressive with its GA medical care and state-
subsidized health insurance program, MinnesotaCare. Eligibility for
MinnesotaCare has been expanded since it began in 1992. Today the
program covers children through age twenty-one with family in-
comes below 275 percent of poverty and single adults and childless
couples with incomes up to 175 percent of poverty. Approximately

93,000 persons received health insurance through MinnesotaCare in
1995. In July 1995 the state expanded its Section 1115 waiver program
and began receiving federal financial match for children and preg-
nant women enrolled in MinnesotaCare.
New York. New York has one of the most far-reaching publicly
supported health insurance systems among the study states and in
the country. The state's AFDC income limit at 53 percent of poverty
is among the highest across the study states. Medicaid eligibility for
infants and pregnant women has been expanded beyond the feder-
ally mandated level, and the state offers a medically needy program.
New York also is one of the most generous states in terms of its GA
and other state-subsidized programs. Of the GA programs studied,
New York's Home Relief program stands out as being the most
generous, in terms of both eligibility and service coverage; it is by far
the largest, with an average monthly caseload of 279,200 in 1995.
Similarly, New York's state-subsidized Child Health Plus program
for low-income children has relatively broad eligibility standards
and covered 124,000 children as of July 1997. Reform legislation in
1996 nearly doubled funding for the Child Health Plus program.
With this new funding, the state expanded both program benefits
and eligibility. The program now covers children through age eight-
een in families with incomes below 222 percent of poverty.
Washington. Washington State also has a history of implement-
ing innovative, progressive health insurance programs for its low-
income population. Medicaid eligibility is generous, covering all
children under age nineteen with family incomes below 200 percent
of the poverty line and pregnant women with incomes up to 185
percent of poverty (Exhibit 1). Washington's Basic Health Plan
(BHP) program was the first of its kind and has served as a model for
other states. The BHP subsidizes individuals, families, or employers
to purchase health insurance coverage from a specified group of
plans. Persons with incomes up to 200 percent of poverty receive
subsidies on a sliding scale, but those with higher incomes may join
by paying the full premium. The employer buy-in option allows em-
ployers to purchase coverage for employees through the BHP, al-
though few employers have chosen to participate. The state receives
federal financial matching funds for children (under age nineteen)
enrolled in the BHP.

California. California has focused on maintaining broad eligibility

policy in California is complicated because of the large concentra-

nant women with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty
level. The state also operates a medically needy program. California
does not have a GA program, and its Access for Infants and Mothers
(AIM) Program serves an average monthly caseload of only 250.
Michigan. Michigan's Medicaid eligibility is broad, particularly for
pregnant women and for children. Infants and pregnant women
with incomes up to 185 percent of poverty and children up to age
sixteen with incomes below 150 percent of poverty qualify to receive
Medicaid benefits. Support for GA and other state-subsidized pro-
grams is limited. In the early 1990s the state's GA program suffered
major cutbacks. A smaller residual GA medical care program, the
State Medical Program, was established and had an average annual
caseload of about 11,500 in 1995. Wayne County has continued oper-
ating a GA medical care program called PlusCare. This program
served approximately 39,000 in 1996. The state has not established
other subsidized health insurance programs.
New Jersey. New Jersey's Medicaid eligibility standards, although
not as broad as Michigan's, are relatively generous. The state has set
AFDC income limits above the national average, has established a
medically needy program, and has expanded eligibility for pregnant
women and for infants beyond the mandated level. Although the
state operates a moderate-size GA program and a relatively small
state-subsidized program for low-income persons, the primary fo-
cus of its health care reform efforts has been on market-based re-
forms. In fact, legislation creating the state-subsidized Health Ac-
cess New Jersey program was passed in 1992, but efforts to
implement the strong insurance market reforms (along with other
factors) delayed its implementation until 1995.
Wisconsin. Wisconsin has extended Medicaid eligibility to chil-
dren and pregnant women with family incomes up to 185 percent of
poverty and operates a medically needy program. There is little sup-
port and, in fact, little need in Wisconsin for additional government
efforts.17 Wisconsin has not established any other state-subsidized
insurance program, and its GA program is small.
n "Limited" states. The remaining five study states--Alabama,
Colorado, Florida, Mississippi, and Texas--fall into the "limited"
group (Exhibit 3). In these states Medicaid eligibility policies gener-
ally satisfy but do not go beyond federal requirements. Efforts to
provide state-subsidized health insurance also are limited.
All five states have AFDC income standards lower than the mean
national level. Alabama and Texas have the lowest limits, with
AFDC income thresholds below 20 percent of poverty. Florida, Mis-
sissippi, and Texas have expanded eligibility to pregnant women

needy programs are available only in Florida and Texas.
None of the states in this category has a GA medical care program,
and only Florida operates a state-subsidized insurance program.
The Florida Healthy Kids program operates in seventeen counties
and provides coverage to uninsured children up to age nineteen. The
program covered approximately 39,300 uninsured children (about 9
percent of all uninsured children in the state) in 1997.18
n Eligibility and enrollment. The combined impact of these
programs in reaching targeted populations is important to consider.
That is, how far do Medicaid and other government programs go in
offering health insurance to the uninsured? One measure of the over-
all impact of these policies is the percentage of the nonelderly low-
income population that is eligible for Medicaid in each state.19
As shown in Exhibits 1Â­3, states in the "comprehensive" and
"moderate" categories generally have a higher proportion of their

nonelderly poverty population eligible for Medicaid. (Recall that
states in these two groups do not differ significantly in their Medic-
aid coverage but do vary in their support for state-funded pro-
grams.) California and Washington had the highest percentages of
eligibles; Texas, Alabama, and Colorado, three states with more
limited Medicaid eligibility standards, had the lowest.
Interestingly, however, several states with relatively generous eli-
gibility guidelines (Wisconsin, New Jersey, and Minnesota) have a
lower-than-average proportion of their poverty populations eligible
for Medicaid. Although more restrictive in their eligibility standards
for Medicaid, Florida and Mississippi had similar percentages of
Medicaid eligibles. These results reflect in part the differing compo-
sition of low-income, nonelderly populations in these states (that is,
a greater share of the poor populations had very low incomes).
Program eligibility rules by themselves do not tell the whole
story. The extent to which eligible persons enroll in the program
also is important to consider. In 1995, 81 percent of the 44.5 million
eligible persons participated in Medicaid nationwide. Among the
study states, participation rates ranged from 69 percent in Wash-
ington, a state with relatively generous eligibility standards, to 96
percent in Colorado, a state with narrower eligibility.
Similarly, several state-subsidized programs have had difficulty in
reaching target populations for a variety of reasons, including insuffi-
cient funding and marketing and outreach difficulties. Participation
rates in these programs are much lower than Medicaid participation
rates; they ranged from a high of 64 percent in the Oregon Health
Plan to a low of 3 percent in New Jersey Health Access.20
Of the programs described here, MinnesotaCare has been one of
the most effective in reaching its target population, with a participa-
tion rate of 56 percent.21 Nonetheless, actual enrollment levels in
MinnesotaCare have consistently remained below projections.
Washington's BHP also has experienced enrollment below esti-
mated levels. In fact, policymakers there, concerned with low enroll-
ment rates, reduced individual premium contribution levels to in-
crease participation in the BHP. As a result, participation more than
doubled from 69,000 in July 1995 to 151,000 in July 1996.
Impact In The States
Assuming that these state efforts to increase health insurance cover-
age are effective, we would expect states in the "comprehensive" and
"moderate" groups to experience lower uninsurance rates, on aver-
age, than states in the "limited" group--especially for low-income
persons, given that programs generally target coverage to them.
Our results support this hypothesis (Exhibit 4). The average un-

insurance rate for low-income populations in states with the
farthest-reaching public efforts is lower than the average for the
"moderate" category. The states in the "limited" group have an unin-
surance rate for low-income persons that is nearly 30 percent higher
than the average for the remaining study states.
Given that the main distinction between the "comprehensive"
and "moderate" categories is the existence and size of GA and other
state-supported programs, the relatively small differential in unin-
surance rates emphasizes the magnitude and importance of Medic-
aid in public health insurance systems. This is not surprising, given
the size of GA and other state programs relative to Medicaid.
Although important for many persons, GA medical care programs
generally have had a small impact on insuring indigent populations,
even in the "comprehensive" states. Average monthly caseload esti-
mates indicate that GA medical care programs in the eight study states
with such programs covered about 595,000 nonelderly uninsured per-
sons (7.9 percent). Likewise, the ten state-subsidized programs among
our study states have covered 550,000 persons (3.3 percent).

ance coverage highlights the significance of Medicaid in providing
coverage to low-income populations. Nationally, Medicaid insured
nearly the same proportion of low-income persons as did employer-
sponsored coverage (Exhibit 4). In contrast, the percentage of all
nonelderly persons with employer-sponsored coverage was more
than five times the percentage with Medicaid coverage.
Among the three groups of study states, employer-sponsored cov-
erage rates were comparable at about 35 percent. However, Medic-
aid coverage levels were higher on average among states in the "com-
prehensive" and "moderate" groups than among states in the
"limited" category. "Comprehensive" and "moderate" states had
above-average Medicaid coverage rates (Exhibit 4). Medicaid cover-
age in the five states in the "limited" category fell nearly five percent-
age points below the national average.
Differences in the composition of insurance coverage across the
three categories are similar for low-income adults but are more
striking if we consider coverage for low-income children (Exhibit
5).22 Low-income adults in states with more limited publicly funded

low-income persons as did employer-sponsored coverage."

insurance programs are more likely to be uninsured than are their
counterparts in states with broader programs. The uninsurance rate
is lowest in the "comprehensive" category and highest in the "lim-
ited" group. Employer-sponsored coverage levels for low-income
adults are relatively comparable across the three categories. Medic-
aid coverage in the "comprehensive" and "moderate" categories is
about 40 percent higher than in the "limited" category.
As with adults, more low-income children were uninsured in
states with more restrictive publicly funded health insurance pro-
grams than in other states. Again, the uninsurance rate was lowest
in the "comprehensive" states and highest in the "limited" states.
Employer-sponsored coverage levels were similar across the three
categories and were comparable to employer coverage levels for
adults. However, Medicaid, with its focus on families with children,
covered a much higher percentage of low-income children than did
employer-sponsored coverage. As expected, Medicaid coverage
rates are also highest in the "comprehensive" and "moderate" states.
"Crowd-out" effect. An important question is whether broad-based
publicly funded insurance programs "crowd out" or substitute for
private coverage. Many have argued, and it is generally agreed, that
there is some "crowding out" of private insurance but that the ex-
tent of the problem is difficult to estimate.23 If there were consider-
able crowding out of private insurance, one would expect to see
states with moderate or comprehensive publicly supported pro-
grams having consistently lower rates of employer-sponsored cover-
age than is true in states with more limited public programs.
There appears to be low correlation between the generosity of
public programs and employer-sponsored insurance levels. Some
states have generous public programs and lower-than-average rates
of employer coverage for low-income persons (New York and Cali-
fornia), and some have limited public programs and relatively high
employer coverage for low-income populations (Alabama and Colo-
rado). At the same time, several states have far-reaching public pro-
grams and high levels of employer coverage (Minnesota, Massachu-
setts, Wisconsin, and Michigan), and some states have neither
broad public efforts nor high employer coverage (Texas and Missis-
sippi). These patterns support the notion that the amount of substi-
tution of public for private coverage is small.
Conclusions
The publicly supported health insurance programs discussed in this
paper have been successful, on average, in filling some of the gaps in
health insurance coverage left by our employment-based health in-
surance system. States with more comprehensive publicly sup-

ported health insurance programs, particularly those with broad
Medicaid standards, have higher Medicaid coverage rates than do
states with limited initiatives, and their low-income populations are
less likely to be uninsured. In fact, Medicaid provided insurance to
nearly the same percentage of low-income nonelderly persons as did
employer-sponsored coverage. The program has been a particularly
important source of coverage for low-income children: Medicaid
covered 49 percent, and employer-sponsored coverage, 35 percent,
of low-income children.
However, even in states with more comprehensive programs,
government-supported health insurance programs were not de-
signed to achieve universal coverage. Thus, these programs have
allocated some resources to the most vulnerable populations but
have left many persons, primarily childless adults, without access to
affordable health insurance.
It is also important to remember that publicly funded health in-
surance is only part of the picture. Virtually all fifty states have
passed legislation reforming the small-group insurance market.
States also have used other approaches not based on insurance to
meet the health care needs of the uninsured, such as support of
safety-net providers. Charity or uncompensated care has been an-
other significant means of providing medical care to under- and
uninsured persons.24 In California, county-based indigent care pro-
grams provided $2.5 billion in subsidies (1992Â­1993) to providers
serving medically indigent persons. New York and Massachusetts
have established uncompensated care pools to subsidize hospitals
and health centers providing charity care. New York's subsidies
amounted to $1.2 billion and Massachusetts's pool amounted to
more than $300 million in 1996.
Several states, although less generous in providing publicly sup-
ported health insurance, have alternative systems to meet the health
care needs of the uninsured. Hospitals and physicians in Alabama
have experienced less financial pressure, given the slow development
of managed care there. These providers have been able to preserve a
substantial financial cushion to subsidize care to the under- and un-
insured. Providers and policymakers in Mississippi and Texas have
attempted to provide access to care for the uninsured through a
system of public hospitals and clinics. Although improving access to
care is important, it is not equivalent to providing insurance: Unin-
sured persons are more likely to postpone getting needed medical
care and are less likely to receive routine physician services.25
Within the context of a voluntary, employment-based health care
system, many factors affect the delivery of care to the under- and
uninsured. Medicaid, GA, and other state-subsidized health insur-

health insurance subsidy programs for low-income populations. The Blue
Cross/Blue Shield Caring programs for children are examples of such pro-
grams to address the health care needs of the uninsured. In this paper we focus
on health insurance subsidy programs funded and operated by state (and
local) governments and operating in several counties or statewide.

15. Information on the generosity of Medicaid eligibility policies was drawn from
case studies, published documents, and tabulations of the CPS.
16. The estimated ratios tend to understate the magnitude of these programs in
reaching the uninsured. Because small sample size does not allow us to esti-
mate the number of low-income uninsured persons by state, we must define
the target population as all uninsured persons in the state. However, most GA
and other state-subsidized programs are targeted to low-income persons.
Estimates of the number of uninsured were tabulated using the CPS.
17. Wisconsin, like New Jersey and Michigan, enjoys a high rate of employer
coverage (see Exhibit 4).
18. Estimates of number of uninsured children in Florida from Urban Institute
tabulations of the March 1995 and 1996 Supplements to the CPS.
19. This includes the population with incomes up to 200 percent of poverty. The
focus is on Medicaid eligibility because it is not possible to estimate the size of
the population eligible for GA and other state-subsidized programs using the
CPS. The CPS does not allow for accurate identification of persons covered by
GA and other state-subsidized programs, nor does it have adequate sample
size at the state level to make reliable estimates of narrow subpopulations.
Estimating Medicaid eligibility and enrollment levels using data available
from the CPS is complex. For example, because the CPS does not contain
information on individuals' medical expenditures, it is difficult to estimate
eligibility for a state's medically needy program. It also is not possible to
estimate full-year or person months of Medicaid enrollment and eligibility
using the CPS.
