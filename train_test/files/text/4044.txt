Introduction
Direct democratic procedures are spreading across the
world. The direct involvement of citizens in policy deci-
sions has frequently been linked to improvements in the
quality of democracy. For instance, many argue that direct
democracy leads to policy choices that are (more) consist-
ent with majority preferences (Leemann and Wasserfallen,
2016; Matsusaka, 2005). Previous research also suggests
that direct democracy increases the political knowledge of
citizens, voter turnout, party membership, and trust in polit-
ical institutions (Altman, 2012; Dyck and Lascher, 2008;
Olken, 2010; Peters, 2016). Yet, we know little about the
effect of direct democracy on the behavior of elites and
their responsiveness to citizen-initiated contacts.
Theories of representative democracy and direct democ-
racy hold different expectations concerning citizens'
involvement in political decision-making (Christiano,
2015). In the former type of government, citizens are
expected to participate indirectly in lawmaking by regu-
larly selecting their representatives in free and fair elec-
tions. In contrast, direct democracy requires citizens to take
an active part in choosing the public policies that will be
implemented. In real life, these ideal types of democracy
interact and contribute to reinforce or undermine the
influence of political elites and representative institutions
on policy-making (Altman, 2010). For example, Altman
(2012) shows that the use of direct democratic procedures,
and in particular initiative rights, increases turnout. There
are, however, few studies examining how direct democratic
procedures affect the functioning of representative democ-
racy from the angle of elites. Thus, the purpose of this arti-
cleistoinvestigatehowdirectandrepresentativedemocracy
interact and influence politicians' political behavior. To do
so, we use a field experiment on Swiss state legislators and
formally test whether direct democracy increases commu-
nicative responsiveness, which in turn should translate into
more policy congruence.

Abstract
Many argue that direct democracy improves the quality of democracy. In particular, many scholars claim that it increases
the representation of the public's preferences by fostering communicative responsiveness between politicians and
citizens. While studies have come to mixed conclusions about the effect of direct democracy on policy outcomes, little
is known about how direct democratic processes affect politicians' responsiveness. Using a field experiment, this study
examines whether direct democracy increases the responsiveness of Swiss state legislators to citizen-initiated contacts
on policy concerns. Contrary to popular belief, our results show that direct democracy does not enhance politicians'
responsiveness to policy requests.

2 Research and Politics 
By examining how the institution of direct democracy
shapes communicative responsiveness, our approach is
similar to Putnam's investigation of institutional perfor-
mance across Italian regions (Putnam, 1993). In his seminal
book Making Democracy Work, Putnam examines how
institutions influence the practice of politics and govern-
ment, including how it affects public officials' responsive-
ness to citizen-initiated contacts in Northern and Southern
Italy. The Swiss context provides a unique setting to answer
questions relating to the effect of direct democracy and its
relation to representative institutions. As the only country
with a long history of direct democratic participation, it
allows us to take advantage of variations in direct demo-
cratic institutions across Swiss cantons (the equivalent of
US states). In practical terms, we emailed approximately
1,700 state legislators using fictitious aliases requesting an
appointment for a policy-related conversation. We then
compared the response rate of legislators to citizens'
requests across cantons with different levels of direct
democracy.
There are reasons to believe that direct democracy
shapes the behavior of elites and increases legislators'
responsiveness to citizen-initiated contacts. Broadly speak-
ing, we identify two mechanisms behind this effect. First,
in direct democratic contexts, citizens potentially threaten
to bloc the legislative process by using their referendum or
initiative rights to recall an existing law or propose a new
law. As a consequence, policy-makers try to anticipate vot-
ers' preferences and follow the position held by the major-
ity, a process that is referred to as the indirect effect of
direct democracy. Legislators thus have stronger incentives
to listen to citizens' policy concerns where direct democ-
racy is strong in order to gain knowledge about what the
public wants and avoid any blocking of the legislative
process.
Second, research on the role of political elites in direct
democratic contexts suggests that politicians remain pow-
erful and contribute in shaping public opinion (Trechsel
and Sciarini, 1998). Legislators can take advantage of citi-
zen-initiated contacts to explain their position to voters in
order to influence their views on specific policies. When
direct participation rules in lawmaking are extensive, the
stake to respond to citizens' communication is even higher
as political elites want to persuade voters in order to main-
tain their control over policy-making. Therefore, we expect
politicians to respond more frequently to voters' requests
when citizens have more opportunities to participate
directly in policy-making.
Focusing on legislators' readiness to listen to the wishes
of the public and explain their policy position to voters, i.e.
communicative responsiveness, is important for under-
standing how the aggregation and articulation of citizens'
preferences take place. In direct democratic contexts, it is
a privileged way for representatives to get knowledge
about voters, influence public opinion, and increase their
legitimacy by involving the public (Esaiasson et al., 2016).
It has the potential to avoid legislative blockage, maintain
legislators' control over political decision-making, and
increase voters' satisfaction with their representatives, and
policy outcomes more generally.
The findings from our field experiment, however, do not
support our hypothesis. Although direct democracy might
encourage citizens to participate more in politics and con-
tact their legislators more frequently, direct democracy
does not enhance politicians' responsiveness to citizen-ini-
tiated contacts. Our results have important implications for
our understanding of the benefits that direct democratic
procedures provide across the world. While they might
improve policy congruence and encourage political partici-
pation, they do not seem to shape the responsiveness of
MPs to citizens' direct requests.
Obstacles to Measuring
Communicative Responsiveness
Research on citizens' influence over political decision-
making has mostly focused on policy responsiveness, i.e.
whether legislators act in accordance with constituents'
views. These studies mainly rely on roll-call data or ideo-
logical positions drawn from survey responses to examine
congruence between legislators' and voters' preferences.
However, representatives also engage in other types of
action to respond to their constituents' needs and concerns.
For instance, constituency service is a clear and simple way
for legislators to respond to voters.
As traditional ways of participating in politics, such as
turnout, are losing ground, citizens increasingly resort to
more individualized and short-term means of political par-
ticipation. Today citizens are more likely to directly contact
their representatives, via mail, email, telephone calls, or
social networks, to influence political decision-making.
Constituency service is an important aspect of legislative
work. Representatives spent a substantial share of their
time and resources to reach and respond to voters. Recent
studies suggest that representatives consider citizen-initi-
ated contacts as one of the most efficient ways to partici-
pate in policy-making, after joining a party and voting
(Hooghe and Marien, 2014; Naurin and Ohberg, 2013).
Direct communications with constituents provide an oppor-
tunity for politicians to listen to the wishes of the public and
explain their policy position, but also to adapt their behav-
ior to follow majority opinion (Esaiasson et al., 2016).
However, little attention has been given to how politi-
cians respond to citizen-initiated contacts, and in particular,
how institutions contribute to shaping communicative
responsiveness. Previous research largely uses observa-
tional data, and existing field experiments mostly focus on
the Unites States. Experimental designs advance the litera-
ture by overcoming inferential challenges that often plague
observational studies on communicative responsiveness
Lloren 3
and constituency service. In particular, surveys with elected
officials are often characterized by low levels of response
rates. For example, Hooghe and Marien's (2014) study on
how representatives perceive citizens' requests in eight
countries is based on surveys were response rates varied
from 15% (Italy) to 39% (Belgium).1 Moreover, experi-
ments enable us to overcome limitations due to social desir-
ability, which can lead politicians'to overstate constituency
work in surveys (De Vries et al., 2015). To sum up, our
experimental design avoids widespread problems found in
observational studies.
There are potential ethical issues in collecting data
through field experiments, especially when they imply con-
tacting politicians with fictitious identities and policy
requests. Issues pertaining to deception, anonymity, and
extra burden placed on politicians' daily activities are the
main ethical concerns raised by our research design. While
most field experiments in political science examine citi-
zens' behavior, experimental designs that focus on political
elites have only recently started to become a popular way to
study political decision-making (Grose, 2014). Following
the guidelines developed by Butler and Broockman (2011),
our research design takes these important ethical concerns
into account. Deception is necessary to overcome common
shortcomings of observational studies on responsiveness
and constituency service (politicians' low response rates to
surveys or social desirability bias). However, the deception
of legislators is offset by minimizing "the burden placed on
legislators' time" (Butler and Broockman, 2011: 468). The
email formulates a request in a short and simple way so that
it is easy for legislators to respond. Grose (2014) notes that
repeated field experiments on legislators might increase the
burden on political elites. However, to the best of the
author's knowledge few experiments in the European and
Swiss context have targeted legislators via email requests
(see, e.g., De Vries et al., 2015 or Giger and Lanz, 2016).
Second, the research guarantees the anonymity of politi-
cians'responses (and non-responses) to ensure that no harm
will be caused to the participants of the field experiment by
anonymizing individual-level data.
Experimental Design
In November 2015, we conducted a field experiment with
1,756 randomly selected state legislators elected in the
German- and French-speaking cantons of Switzerland
(70% sample of all legislators). These politicians received
an email from fictitious voters requesting an appointment
for a policy-related conversation (for similar experimental
designs see, e.g., Broockman, 2013; Butler, 2014; Butler
and Broockman, 2011; McClendon, 2016).2 The analysis
excludes 69 cases with wrong email addresses or auto-
replies. In total, 1,687 legislators received the email.
Similarly to other previous studies, the experiment treats
the email addresses of the representatives and not legisla-
tors themselves (see, e.g., Butler and Broockman, 2011;
McClendon, 2016).
Table 1 shows the exact email translated into English.
The original emails were in German to state legislators
from the German-speaking part of Switzerland and in
French to state legislators from the French-speaking part
(see Tables 2 and 3 for emails in the original language). The
emails varied in several factors that are not essential for this
study.3 First, the occupational background of the sender and
whether they are a member of a union. While union mem-
bership is biased to the left, the sentence "I am an active
union member" was randomly assigned as part of a treat-
ment condition. Owing to random assignment, union status
is unrelated to the main independent variable and therefore
does not bias the results presented in this paper. Second, we
diversified the email messages by using different sender's
names, gender and timing of the email. In particular, we
selected 10 of the most common Swiss names (5 male and
5 female names) and created corresponding gmail accounts.
In addition, we sent out emails in four different batches
with one week between the batches. These factors are
included as control variables in our analysis below.
The exact wording of the email is partly based on infor-
mal interviews with state legislators. The interviews
focused on how citizens usually contact their legislators
(frequency and type of request, etc.). In general, politicians
confirmed that they were frequently contacted by voters
with policy requests: in Western Europe, service requests
are dealt by civil servants and almost never by legislators.

4 Research and Politics 
Voters usually contact legislators to share their opinion on a
specific concern or ask them to explain their position on a
particular issue or event. Communicative responsiveness is
thus an important part of legislators' work (for a discussion
of this concept, see, e.g., Ohberg and Naurin, 2015). Our
experimental design takes this information into account.
Following the interviews, we excluded any reference to
a particular political topic in the emails. Instead, the
emails allude to "various political topics that are important
to me".
We match the data from our experiment with informa-
tion on direct democratic institutions in Swiss cantons.
Switzerland offers a unique setting to test the impact of
direct democracy. Cantons provide important variation
with regard to direct democratic rights. For instance, some
cantons offer very extensive participatory rights, while
other cantons are "more strongly oriented toward represent-
ative democracy" (Freitag and Ackermann, 2015: 6). We
use two measures to gauge the scope of direct democratic
rights in cantons.4 First, we draw on an index measuring
how much formal direct democratic rights are developed.
The measure assesses the difficulty for citizens to use direct
democratic procedures (e.g. the number of signatures
required or the time granted to collect signatures). The
index varies between 1 (low direct democratic rights) and 6
(high direct democratic rights). Second, we use "the yearly
average of all cantonal popular votes (for initiatives and
referendums) from 2006 to 2009" (Fatke, 2015) to measure
the actual use of direct democracy. The measure ranges
from 1 (the canton of Valais) to 19.5 (the canton of Glarus).
Both direct democratic indexes are common in the lit-
erature on Swiss direct democracy (Fatke, 2015; Freitag
and Ackermann, 2015; Leemann and Wasserfallen, 2016).
They have recently been updated by Schaub and Dlabac
(2012). The indexes represent two complementary ways of
measuring the extent to which direct democratic rights are
developed at the cantonal level, namely presence and actual
use of direct participatory rights. Using both indexes
strengthens our results by examining whether they are con-
sistent across different measures. The indexes are only
moderately correlated (Fatke, 2015), which means that
there are some differences between presence and actual use
of direct democratic rights across cantons. For example, the
Canton of Geneva offers citizens less opportunities to use
direct democratic rights (the score is 1.75 on the first index)
but popular votes are used comparatively frequently (the
score is 15 on the second index).
Figure 1 illustrates the variation in the scope of direct
democratic rights at the cantonal level when using the first
index. Overall, the figure shows that these rights tend to be
more developed in German-speaking cantons than in
French- and Italian-speaking cantons. Formal rules are
most extensive in the Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden,
followed by the canton of Basel Land and Solothurn, while
they are the least developed in the cantons of Geneva,
Ticino, and Vaud. The second index reveals that, between
2006 and 2009, popular votes were mostly used in the can-
ton of Glarus and the least in the canton of Valais. Leemann
and Wasserfallen (2016) calculated California's score on
the formal rule index. The State's score was about 2.33
compared with Switzerland's average score of 4.11. In light
of this result, they conclude that Swiss cantons provide, on
average, extensive democratic rights to their citizens.
To answer the question whether legislators are more
responsive to citizens when direct democratic institutions
are more developed, we compare the response rate of legis-
lators across cantons. The dependent variable is whether or
not a legislator responds to the email. As a robustness
check, we also use an alternative dependent variable,
namely whether or not a legislator agrees to a political con-
versation. The two outcome variables capture different
aspects of legislators' responsiveness to citizen-initiated
contacts that have played an important role in previous
research. The first focuses on whether politicians respond
at all (see, e.g., Butler and Broockman, 2011) and the sec-
ond considers the quality of the response by capturing
whether a legislator satisfies the request from a citizen to
grant them a meeting. Using two distinct measures of
responsiveness ensures that the results are consistent across
different definitions of the outcome variable.
Because legislators are nested within cantons, the analy-
ses use multilevel, logistic regression models with random
effects for the canton level. Our models control for addi-
tional characteristics such as the sender's occupational
background, organizational membership, name, gender, the
email batch, the party of the legislator, and whether the
email was in French or German. In addition, we control for
cantonal level factors, such as population size and unem-
ployment rate.
Results
Of the 1,687 state legislators who received by email, 818
responded within two weeks so that the response rate was
about 50%. Moreover, 622 politicians agreed to a conversa-
tion about political issues, either in person or via phone
and email (36.9%). This response rate is similar to that of
Table 3. Original email in French.

previous experiments carried out in the United States (see,
e.g., Broockman, 2013; Butler and Broockman, 2011).
Table 4 reports the estimates from logistic regression
models on state legislators' responsiveness to citizen-initi-
ated contacts. The analyses show that responsiveness is
more widespread among legislators elected in German-
speaking cantons. Other studies have arrived at similar con-
clusions (see, e.g., Giger and Lanz, 2016). Swiss­German
cantons display more comprehensive direct democratic
rights than French-speaking cantons. However, contrary to
theoretical expectations, the results indicate that direct
democracy does not increase politicians' responsiveness to
policy requests. Cultural differences could explain these
differences in responsiveness. In particular, differences in
politicians' political socialization leading to specific con-
ceptions of representation might lead to differences in
emphasis with regard to responsiveness.
The coefficient for formal participatory rules is negative
and far from statistical significance (Model 1).Accordingly,
legislators in cantons with more extensive participatory
rights are not more likely to respond to constituents'
requests. Likewise, the second column of Table 4 indicates
that an increase in the actual use of direct democratic pro-
cedures has no effect on politicians propensity to reply to
citizens communications (Model 2). While the point esti-
mate is positive, it is substantively small and far from being
statistically significant. As a robustness check, we ran the
analyses with an alternative dependent variable, namely
whether or not a legislator agrees to a political conversa-
tion. The analyses yield similar results (see Table 5). To
sum up, direct democracy might encourage citizens to par-
ticipate more in politics (Altman, 2012) and to contact their
legislators more frequently. However, our findings suggest
that citizens' direct participation in lawmaking does not
encourage legislators to respond more to citizens policy
requests. This result is consistent across different measures
for the dependent and main independent variables.
An important limitation of our analyses is that the number
of cantons is limited to 25 and some of the variation in direct
democracy across cantons is explained by the language
control variable (German- versus French-speaking cantons).5
To address this problem, we conducted a simulation-based
power analysis. The analysis examines the statistical power
of our study by asking how large the true effect would have
to be in order to be detectable. It involves three steps
(Gelman and Hill, 2007). First, we simulated data based on
the models presented in Table 4. The sample size, covariate
distribution, model specification, and parameters are all
determined by the estimated model but we incrementally
changed the true effect size of the two direct democracy
indexes. As a result, we obtained fake or simulated data for
the outcome variable. Second, we used the simulated out-
come variable to fit the same model presented in Table 4.
Finally, we repeated the simulation steps 1,000 times and
computed the statistical power as the average number of
simulation runs with an effect that is statistically significant
at the 0.05 level. The results are presented in Figure 2. They
show how the statistical power, i.e. the likelihood that our
study would detect an effect, depends on the true effect
size. For small effects, the power is relatively low but
increases rapidly for medium and large effects: 80% power
is achieved for effect sizes of 0.22 and 0.14 for the first and
second direct democratic index respectively. This corre-
sponds to 1.246 and 1.150 in odds ratio. These findings
indicate that our study has sufficient statistical power to
detect medium and large effects particularly for the second
Figure 1. Variation in direct democratic rights in Swiss cantons.
6 Research and Politics 
direct democracy index but not necessarily small effects.
Accordingly, these results suggest that Switzerland as the
only country with a long history of direct democratic insti-
tutions provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of
direct democracy on the responsiveness of MPs.
Conclusion
Recent studies have shown that citizens' direct participa-
tion in decision-making generates policy outcomes that are
(more) consistent with majority preferences. Moreover,
research suggests that the institution of direct democracy
has positive secondary consequences for citizens, such as
enhancing voters' political knowledge, and satisfaction
with political decisions. However, little is known about
how direct democratic procedures affect the behavior of
political elites. In particular, no studies have, to the best of
the author's knowledge, examined whether direct participa-
tion in lawmaking increases politicians' communicative
responsiveness.
The effect of direct democracy on responsiveness is
especially important given that "the main democratic power
of direct democracy is that the political elite anticipate pref-
erence deviations and, in the case that voters have extensive
direct democratic rights, follow the position held by (the
large) majority of voters" (Leemann and Wasserfallen,
2016). Provided that legislators are both vote- and policy-
seekers, they have incentives to respond to citizen-initiated
contacts to gain knowledge about what citizens want to
avoid any legislative blocking. In contexts where direct
democracy is strong, representatives might also want to
maintain control over political decision-making: responding
to citizens' policy requests provides them with the opportu-
nity to explain their position to voters and shape public
opinion. Therefore, we expected politicians to respond more
frequently to voters' policy requests when citizens have
more opportunities to participate directly in lawmaking.
Our results show, however, that state elected officials are
not more likely to respond to citizens' policy requests when
direct democratic rights are extensive. How can we explain
this finding? It could be that politicians in cantons with
more direct democracy receive more emails and that they
are, therefore, less likely to notice and respond to them. This
explanation is, however, unlikely since research suggests
that direct democracy procedures do not automatically
increase citizens' political participation (see, e.g., Altman,
2012).
With regard to the literature on the indirect effect of
direct democracy, our findings suggest that communicative
responsiveness is not a central mechanism through which
politicians can be informed about what the public wants or
persuade voters to adopt certain viewpoints. There are, of
course, other ways through which legislators can get
informed about citizens' preferences or persuade them to
adopt their views. For instance, organized interests can play
an important role in the aggregation of citizens'preferences
and are often integrated in the early stages of the legislative
process to avoid blockages in lawmaking (Sciarini, 2007).
More importantly, however, not all voters and interest
groups are equally active (and successful) in trying to reach
out to politicians. For instance, studies have shown that
legislators tend to represent the viewpoints of advantaged
citizens (Giger et al., 2012; Gilens, 2012; Rosset, 2016).
Therefore, legislators interested in passing policy (i.e.
ensure themselves a victory in popular votes) and keeping
their seat might want to take into account the preferences of
the median voter rather than the preferences of citizens who
contact them. In order to learn about the median voters'
position and persuade them effectively, legislators might
best rely on other means than on one-to-one meetings with

voters who contacted them, such as surveys, public meet-
ings, or writing newspaper editorials. Put differently, there
are alternative pathways than communicative responsive-
ness that can make politicians' reactive to citizens' con-
cerns and needs. Future research should thus further
examine how direct democratic rights affect political elites'
behavior.
