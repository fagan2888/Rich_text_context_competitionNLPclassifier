Introduction
In the past decade, self-compassion has emerged as an
important quality for mental health and well-being. This
construct, defined as treating oneself with kindness and
nonjudgmental acceptance in response to perceived chal-
lenges and failures (Neff, 2003), shows consistent relation-
ships with a wide range of desirable psychological attributes
(MacBeth and Gumley, 2012; Neff et al., 2007a). Growing
evidence indicates that self-compassion is also associated
with several key health-related outcomes including lower
perceived stress (Allen and Leary, 2010; Sirois et al., 2015b),
attenuated physiological responses to stress (Arch et al.,
2014; Breines et al., 2014), the practice of health-promoting
behaviors (Dunne et al., 2016; Sirois et al., 2015a; Terry
et al., 2013), and better physical health (Brown et al., 2016;
Dunne et al., 2016; Hall et al., 2013). However, the evidence
base demonstrating the benefits of self-compassion for
health is outpacing research into the pathways and processes
that might account for this association. The limited evidence
to date suggests that engagement with health-promoting
behaviors may explain why self-compassionate people
experience better physical health (Dunne et al., 2016), and
that lower levels of negative affect account for the link
between self-compassion and better health behaviors
(Sirois et al., 2015a). In light of the consistent relationships
between perceived stress and physical health (Cohen
et al., 2007; McEwen, 2007), and between stress and poor
health behaviors (Cohen et al., 1983; Sirois, 2007), it is
plausible that lower perceived stress is involved in the
pathway connecting self-compassion to health behaviors
and physical health. The purpose of this study was to test
this idea.
Self-compassion and stress
Self-compassion is commonly conceptualized as including
three key components (Neff, 2003), each of which can have
benefits for reducing stress. Self-kindness refers to respond-
ing to perceived inadequacy or disappointment with under-
standing, patience, and acceptance, rather than with harsh
self-criticism. This response presumably defuses negative
emotions and helps the individual to reinterpret stressful
events in a self-supportive way. Common humanity refers

Exploring the roles of perceived
stress and health-promoting behaviors

Abstract
Growing evidence indicates that self-compassion is associated with better physical health, but the pathways that mediate
this relationship are not well understood. This study tested a serial mediation model that linked self-compassion,
perceived stress, health behaviors, and a comprehensive index of physical health. A sample of 176 individuals completed
an online survey posted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Self-compassion had an indirect effect on physical health via both
mediators and through the sequential pathway, suggesting that taking a kind, accepting and mindful stance toward one's
flaws and failures may have benefits for reducing stress and promoting health behaviors.

to the recognition that all people are imperfect, make mis-
takes, and experience failure.As a result of this recognition,
self-compassionate people do not feel isolated by the expe-
rience of failure or struggle, but recognize that stressful
events are part of the human experience. Appraising diffi-
cult events from this perspective would likely reduce the
perception of threat that contributes to stress, as well as
reduce the barriers to seeking help when in times of need
(Allen and Leary, 2010; Sirois et al., 2015b). Finally, mind-
fulness refers to not becoming over-identified with the
negative feelings that can arise after failure or during strug-
gles, but maintaining a balanced sense of awareness of
those feelings. This mindset can help reduce stress by mini-
mizing rumination over the negative aspects of events.
Together, the components of self-compassion are posited to
reduce stress by enhancing the self-regulation of negative
emotions that can result from failures and unexpected
events (Neff et al., 2007a).
Substantial evidence supports the idea that self-
compassion can reduce perceived stress. The link between
self-compassion and lower stress has been well documented
based on self-report measures (Allen and Leary, 2010;
Brion et al., 2014; Finlay-Jones et al., 2015; Pinto-Gouveia
et al., 2014; Sirois, 2014; 2015b), and interventions
designed to increase self-compassion produce simultane-
ous decreases in perceived stress (Neff and Germer, 2013).
Studies employing physiological measures have also sup-
ported this relationship. For example, persons with higher
self-compassion show lower sympathetic nervous system
activation and reduced inflammatory response following
exposure to a lab stressor, even after accounting for demo-
graphics, depressive symptoms, and distress (Breines et al.,
2014, 2015). They also demonstrate greater heart rate varia-
bility, an index of parasympathetic influence on the heart
which reflects greater ability to return to a resting state fol-
lowing acute stress (Svendsen et al., 2016). Finally, an exper-
imental study found that brief training in self-compassion
dampened young women's psychobiological responses to a
social evaluative threat relative to two control conditions
(Arch et al., 2014). Specifically, women who listened to a
10-minute recording encouraging self-compassionate atti-
tudes once a day for 4
days showed reduced sympathetic
nervous system reactivity (salivary alpha amylase), greater
heart rate variability, and lower self-reported anxiety.
Because chronic activation of the physiological stress
response has been shown to have a detrimental effect on
health (Cohen et al., 1983, 2007; McEwen, 2007), these
findings suggest that both dispositional self-compassion
and induced state self-compassion can protect health by
mitigating this activation.
In addition to having a direct influence on physical
health through psychophysiological pathways (Cohen
et al., 1983; McEwen, 2007), stress can influence health
indirectly through its effects on health behaviors. As people
attempt to cope with stress, they may engage in behaviors
that bring short-term relief, such as smoking, drinking alco-
hol, or consuming high-calorie, highly processed foods (Ng
and Jeffery, 2003; Pak et al., 1999; Steptoe et al., 1998).
They also are likely to neglect health-promoting behaviors,
such as exercise (Ng and Jeffery, 2003; Stults-Kolehmainen
and Sinha, 2014), or careful adherence to other medical
regimens (e.g. Bottonari et al., 2010). Similar to the direct
pathway, this indirect pathway is most detrimental to health
when stress is prolonged and the behavioral responses
occur over an extended period of time (World Health
Organization (WHO), 2014).
Self-compassion, health behaviors, and health
A nascent body of evidence indicates that self-compassion
facilitates the practice of a range of important health behav-
iors. For example, self-compassion is associated with
healthy eating behaviors (Adams and Leary, 2007;
Schoenefeld and Webb, 2013), exercise behavior (Magnus
et al., 2010), smoking cessation (Kelly et al., 2010), dietary
adherence (Dowd and Jung, 2017), medical adherence
(Brion et al., 2014; Sirois and Hirsch, forthcoming), seek-
ing medical care (Terry et al., 2013), and indices of general
health-promoting behaviors (Dunne et al., 2016; Sirois
et al., 2015a). The association of self-compassion with
health behaviors has been explained in terms of its links to
self-regulation (Terry and Leary, 2011), and adaptive regu-
lation of emotions in particular (Sirois, 2015; Sirois et al.,
2015a). Self-compassionate people respond to the inevita-
ble failures and setbacks that can occur when trying to
change their health behaviors with acceptance rather than
judgment (self-kindness) and view their mistakes as some-
thing everyone experiences (common humanity) rather
than becoming immersed in negative feelings or stressing
about their situation (mindfulness; for example, Adams and
Leary, 2007). Because negative affect is known to interfere
with self-regulation (Sirois, 2015; Wagner and Heatherton,
2015), self-compassionate responding can help people to
maintain the practice of health behaviors by tempering neg-
ative emotions that may arise in response to health behavior
goal setbacks. Evidence supporting this proposition comes
from a meta-analysis that found self-compassion was con-
sistently and positively associated with more frequent prac-
tice of variety of health-promoting behaviors, such as
regular exercise, healthy eating, healthy sleep behaviors,
and stress management in 15 samples involving more than
3000 participants (Sirois et al., 2015a). As described previ-
ously, self-compassion can also reduce perceived stress,
which typically has a substantial subjective distress compo-
nentandtendstocorrelatewithnegativeaffect(Dohrenwend
and Shrout, 1985). For this reason, this study posited that
self-compassion would convey a similar positive effect on
health behavior through reduced perceived stress.
Self-compassion also appears to be beneficial for physi-
cal health. Several studies have linked self-compassion to
Homan and Sirois 3
measures of physical well-being (Hall et al., 2013), physi-
cal symptom scores (Dunne et al., 2016), and a composite
measure of physical health (Brown et al., 2016). However,
aside from one study (Dunne et al., 2016), there has been
little research into the reasons why self-compassion is
linked to better physical health. Dunne et al. (2016) found
that health-promoting behaviors partly explained the asso-
ciation between self-compassion and fewer physical symp-
toms, but a potential limitation of this finding is that
self-reported symptoms tend to be influenced by negative
affect. Specifically, although negative affect is consistently
related to health complaints as measured by symptom
checklists, it is unrelated to many other indices of health,
such as frequency of illness, usage of health care, role limi-
tations due to physical health, pathology, or overall mortal-
ity(WatsonandPennebaker,1989).Becauseself-compassion
is consistently associated with lower levels of negative
affect (Neff et al., 2007a; Sirois et al., 2015a), it is important
to use measures that assess physical health with a range of
indicators to avoid artificially inflated estimates of the asso-
ciation between self-compassion and health.
This study
The aim of this study was to test a serial mediation model
in which the health-beneficial effects of self-compassion
are conveyed through reduced perceived stress and
increased health behaviors. A diagram of our proposed
model is presented in Figure 1. We hypothesized that self-
compassion would be inversely associated with perceived
stress, and positively associated with more frequent health
behaviors and better physical health. We further predicted
that perceived stress would be inversely associated with
frequency of health behaviors and physical health, and
frequency of health behaviors would show a positive
association with physical health. In regard to mediation,
we expected that self-compassion would have significant
indirect effects on both health behaviors and physical
health through perceived stress. Of primary interest, we
hypothesized that self-compassion would have a positive
indirect effect on physical health through the serial path-
way involving reduced perceived stress and increased
health behaviors. Importantly, we used a well-validated
composite measure of physical health, the RAND-36
(Hays and Morales, 2001), that included not only physical
symptoms but also physical functioning, role limitations,
and general health.
In addition, we tested an alternate model in which the
causal ordering of perceived stress and health behaviors
was reversed. Previous work has shown that reduced nega-
tive affect mediates the relationship between self-compassion
and health behaviors (Sirois et al., 2015a), and this finding
formed the basis for our original serial mediation model.
However, it is also plausible that health behaviors mediate
the relationship between self-compassion and perceived
stress. In this conceptualization, self-compassion will show
a positive association with health behaviors, and in turn,
health behaviors will show an inverse relationship with per-
ceived stress. If this model is correct, we expected that self-
compassion would have a significant indirect effect on
perceived stress through health behavior. However, if this
model is incorrect, we expected to see no mediating effect
of health behavior.
Methods
Participants and procedure
All procedures were approved by the Institutional
Review Board and all participants were treated accord-
ing to ethical guidelines established by the American
Psychological Association. A brief description of the
study, including estimated duration and compensation,
was posted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk website.
MTurk is a website that provides online "workers" with
opportunities to complete online tasks for monetary
compensation. It is recognized as a source of quality data
for social science research, and tends to provide greater
diversity than college samples (Buhrmester et al., 2011).
Interested participants were directed to a survey link.
Before proceeding, participants were required to indi-
cate that they understood the informed consent informa-
tion and that they agreed to participate. Following
acknowledgment of informed consent, the measures
described below were presented in random order. Two
attention checks were embedded in the survey (e.g. "To
make sure you are paying attention, please answer
strongly disagree"), and those who failed either check
were not included in the data set. Participants were paid
US$2.50 for completing the survey.
The final sample consisted of 176 participants (44.9%
female) with an average age of 31.6years (standard devia-
tion (SD)=10.1). The majority identified as White (76.9%)
with the remaining identifying as Asian-American (11.0%),
African-American (8.2%), Latin-American (2.8%), or mul-
tiracial (1.0%). In regard to relationship status, 47.4percent
were single, 46.3percent were in a long-term relationship,
and 6.3percent were divorced. In regard to education level,

compassion and physical health through perceived stress and

57.1percent had a high school degree or some college, and
42.9percent had a college degree or higher.
Measures
Self-compassion.The 12-item Self-Compassion Scale­Short
Form (Raes et al., 2011) was used to measure self-compas-
sion (e.g. "I try to be understanding and patient towards those
aspects of my personality I don't like"). Items are rated on a
5-point response scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5
(almost always). The short form correlates almost perfectly
with the original, longer version of the scale and showed
good internal consistency among Dutch and American
undergraduate students (Raes et al., 2011). Recent psycho-
metric analysis of this instrument has supported the use of
the overall score as a general measure of self-compassion
(Neff et al., 2017). Items were reversed where necessary and
added to create a single self-compassion score. Cronbach's
alpha for this study was .82.
Health outcomes.The RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0
(RAND-36; Hays and Morales, 2001) was used to assess
physical health. The 36-item scale is made up of eight multi-
item scales assessing physical function, role limitations due
to physical health problems, pain, general health, vitality,
social functioning, role limitations due to emotional prob-
lems, and emotional well-being. Scores on the subscales
range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater
freedom from disability. The eight subscales can be stand-
ardized and weighted to produce two summary measures:
the physical component summary (PCS) and mental compo-
nent summary (MCS) scores (Farivar et al., 2007; Hays and
Morales, 2001). Only the PCS was used in this study. The
RAND-36 was first developed and tested for the Medical
Outcomes Study (MOS), a 2-year study of chronic medical
conditions (Ware and Sherbourne, 1992), but it has subse-
quently been used in numerous studies involving thousands
of participants (Hays and Morales, 2001). Ample evidence
supports the reliability and validity of the RAND SF-36
(Vander Zee et al., 1996). Internal consistency for the eight
subscales that were used to create the weighted PCS ranged
from .81 (pain) to .89 (mental health) in this study.
Perceived stress. The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS;
Cohen and Williamson, 1988) was used to assess the per-
ceived stressfulness of events experienced within the past
month. Items tapping the degree to which respondents
found their lives unpredictable, uncontrollable, and over-
whelming (e.g. "In the last month, how often have you felt
nervous and stressed") are rated on a 5-point scale ranging
from "Never" to "Very often." A total perceived stress score
was calculated by averaging the items after reverse coding
the negative items. The PSS has demonstrated good relia-
bility and validity (Cohen and Williamson, 1988). In this
study, Cronbach's alpha was .92.
Health behavior.General health protective practices were
assessed using four subscales from the Health Promoting
Lifestyle Profile II (HPLPII; Walker et al., 1995). The
9-item Health Responsibility subscale assesses the extent to
which participants assume accountability for their own
well-being (e.g. "I discuss my health concerns with health
professionals"). The 8-item Stress Management subscale
assesses the individual's efforts to control or reduce tension
(e.g. "I pace myself to prevent tiredness"). The 9-item
Nutrition subscale asks about healthful eating habits (e.g. "I
read labels to identify nutrients in packaged food") and the
8-item Physical Activity subscale asks about engagement
in light, moderate, and/or vigorous physical exercise ("I
take part in light to moderate physical activity such as sus-
tained walking five more times a week"). Participants indi-
cate their frequency of each behavior on a 4-point scale
(1=never, 4=routinely). The HPLPII has good psychomet-
ric properties including test­retest reliability, good internal
consistency, and validity as evidenced by moderate to large
correlations with other measures of lifestyle and perceived
health (Walker and Hill-Polerecky, 1996). For this study, all
items were averaged to create an overall health behavior
composite with higher scores indicating more frequent
practice of health-promoting behaviors.
Results
First, data were examined for missing values. One case was
deleted due to excessive missing data (more than 20%).
Missing data for the remaining cases was very low (<5%).
Skew and kurtosis were within recommended limits for
regression analysis (i.e. less than 3.0 for skew and less than
10.0 for kurtosis; Kline, 2010). Descriptive statistics for the
major study variables and their intercorrelations are presented
in Table 1. Self-compassion was positively and significantly
correlated with health behavior and physical health and nega-
tively correlated with perceived stress. Perceived stress
showed a significant inverse relationship with physical health,
and health behavior showed positive associations with health.
The PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2013) was used
to determine total, direct, and indirect effects of self-
compassion, perceived stress, and health-promoting behav-
ior on physical health. A conceptual diagram of the serial
mediation model is presented in Figure 2, along with path
coefficients. Participant's sex and age were entered as
covariates. Values for the standardized indirect, direct, and
total effects of self-compassion on health outcomes are pre-
sented in Table 2. The significance of indirect effects was
tested using 95percent confidence intervals based on 5000
bias-corrected bootstrap samples and confidence intervals
that did not contain zero were regarded as significant. This
procedure is now recommended for testing the significance
of indirect effects because it does not require the assump-
tion of normality for the sampling distribution of indirect
effects (Hayes, 2009).
Homan and Sirois 5
Consistent with previous work, self-compassion had a
significant indirect effect on health behaviors through per-
ceived stress (Sirois et al., 2015a). There was a strong
inverse association between self-compassion and per-
ceived stress, and lower stress was associated with more
frequent health behaviors. Self-compassion had signifi-
cant indirect effects on physical health through both per-
ceived stress and health behaviors. People with higher
self-compassion tended to perceive lower levels of stress
and also tended to engage in more frequent health-pro-
moting behaviors; both of these pathways were related to
better physical health. The serial path from self-compas-
sion to physical health via both perceived stress and health
behaviors was also significant, supporting the idea that
self-compassion leads to lower levels of perceived stress,
and lower perceived stress leads to increased frequency of
health behaviors. The complete model explained 38
per-
cent of the variance in physical health.
Finally, we tested an alternate model that reversed the
order of perceived stress and health behavior (i.e. health
behavior was entered as the first mediator and perceived
stress was the second; Figure 3). Results are summarized
in Table 3. As was the case with the original model, the
serial pathway through these two mediators was signifi-
cant and the magnitude of this serial pathway did not dif-
fer substantially between the two models. The specific
indirect effects through each of these two mediators were
very similar to those observed in the original model. The
primary difference in the two models involved the simple
mediation model embedded within the full alternate model
(i.e. self-compassion to health behaviors to perceived
stress; see top part of Table 3). In the alternate model,
nearly all of the total effect of self-compassion on per-
ceived stress was direct, with only a small indirect effect
through health behaviors. In contrast, in the original
model, self-compassion had a substantial indirect effect
on health behavior through perceived stress.
Discussion
This study tested a serial mediation model linking self-
compassion with physical health via perceived stress and
health behaviors. Consistent with previous research (e.g.
Brion et al., 2014; Dunne et al., 2016; Sirois et al., 2015a),
we found that self-compassionate people reported lower
stress, more frequent health behaviors, and better overall
physical health. Importantly, both lower stress and more
frequent health behaviors explained the association with
physical health individually, and the full pathway through
stress and health behaviors was also significant.
Although our alternate model showed that health behav-
ior did mediate the relationship between self-compassion
and perceived stress, this indirect effect was small, suggest-
ing that our original model was the more plausible of the
two. Specifically, nearly all of the total effect of self-com-
passion on perceived stress was direct, with only a small
indirect effect through health behaviors. In contrast, in the
original model, there was a substantial mediating effect,
with nearly half of the total effect of self-compassion on
health behavior occurring through perceived stress. Because
self-compassion has such a strong inverse relationship with
perceived stress, we reasoned that this reduction in per-
ceived stress was more likely to affect a person's propensity
for engaging in health-promoting behavior than vice versa.
Overall, our findings extend our understanding of self-
compassion and physical health in several important ways.
First, although previous research has shown that self-com-
passion is associated with lower levels of perceived stress,
this study was the first to test perceived stress as a mediator
of the relationship between self-compassion and physical
health. Indeed, this pathway accounted for most of the total
effect of self-compassion on health. Second, whereas previ-
ous research has noted that self-compassion is linked to
physical symptoms via the practice of health behaviors
(Dunne et al., 2016), this study replicated these findings
using a comprehensive index of physical health that
included symptoms, functioning, and a global rating of
overall health. In addition, negative affective states have
been shown to account for why self-compassionate people
may be better able to regulate their health behaviors (Sirois,
2015; Sirois et al., 2015a). The current results extend these
previous findings by demonstrating that lower stress, argu-
ably a negative affective state, explains the association
between self-compassion and health behaviors. Finally, our
test of the full path model linking self-compassion to stress,

health behaviors, and physical health provides the first test
of the combined pathways from previous research on self-
compassion and health (Dunne et al., 2016; Sirois, 2015;
Sirois et al., 2015a), and indicates that self-compassion
may relate to physical health through multiple routes.
The stress pathway accounted for most of the indirect
and total effects of self-compassion on physical health, sug-
gesting that it is the most salient route connecting self-com-
passion and health benefits. This result underscores the
direct and immediate beneficial effects of self-compassion
on the psychophysiological experience of stress (alpha-
amylase activity, heart rate variability, and interleukin-6
response) found in other research (Arch et al., 2014; Breines
et al., 2014, 2015). Although this physiological activation
of the stress systems can be most damaging when pro-
longed (Cohen et al., 2012; McEwen, 2007), even short-
term acute activation can take a toll on immediate health by
suppressing immune functioning and creating vulnerability
for infections, and other acute conditions (Taylor and
Sirois, 2014). In contrast, health behaviors can be concep-
tualized as distal or indirect predictors of physical health, as
the effects of poor health behaviors on health status tend to
be cumulative over time (WHO, 2014). Although our
results showed that the stress pathway accounted for most
of self-compassion's effect on health, it is important to note
that self-compassion was linked with increased engage-
ment in health behaviors both directly and indirectly (via
reduced stress). It is likely that self-compassion and the
reduction in perceived stress that accompanies it have small
but cumulative effects on other processes that influence
health, such as increased positive affect (Stellar et al., 2015)
or satisfying social relationships (Holt-Lunstad et al.,
2010). Future research is needed to test this idea.
Growing evidence indicates that self-compassion is mal-
leable and can be enhanced through training (Jazaieri et al.,
2013; Neff and Germer, 2013). For example, Neff and
Germer (2013) developed an 8-week program aimed at
increasing mindful self-compassion. While this program
produced significant increases in self-compassion, there
were concomitant decreases in perceived stress. In light of
the well-documented health benefits of stress management
(Taylor and Sirois, 2014), it is reasonable to think that this
type of program would also have a positive impact on
health. Our findings also suggest that self-compassion
could play a role in interventions directly aimed at improv-
ing health behaviors. For example, several studies have
now found that promoting self-compassionate responding
to health behaviors failures can be effective for reducing
health risk behaviors such as overeating (Adams and Leary,
2007), smoking (Kelly et al., 2010), and alcohol misuse
(Brooks et al., 2012). It is possible that techniques designed
to elevate self-compassion may be equally beneficial for
increasing health-promoting behaviors, and subsequent
physical health. Future research using experimental and
longitudinal methods is needed to provide more rigorous
tests of these ideas.
An important limitation of this study was its cross-
sectional, correlational design. Given this design, it is not
possible to confirm the proposed directionality of the rela-
tions among self-compassion, stress, health behaviors, and
physical health. The models we tested implied that self-
compassion exerted causal effects on both perceived stress
and health behaviors; although this idea could not be con-
firmed in this study, it is consistent with experimental work

that has demonstrated that increases in self-compassion can
produce changes in perceived stress and health behaviors
(Adams and Leary, 2007; Kelly et al., 2010; Neff and
Germer, 2013). We tested an alternate model that placed
health behavior as antecedent to perceived stress, but con-
cluded that our original model was the more plausible of
the two based on the strong relationship between self-
compassion and perceived stress. Furthermore, our original
model was informed by previous theory and research on
self-compassion and health (Dunne et al., 2016; Sirois,
2015; Sirois et al., 2015a; Terry and Leary, 2011).
Nevertheless, further prospective and experimental research
is needed to assess the temporal precedence of our serial
mediation model, particularly because recent evidence sug-
gests that these relationships are dynamic and complex.
Specifically, a longitudinal study examined how stress and
health behaviors were related using ecological momentary
assessment over a period of 12months (Burg et al., 2017).
The authors found that stress and exercise behaviors were
inversely related but that this association was both unidi-
rectional (stress to exercise) and bi-directional (stress to
exercise to stress). Daily diary studies and similar ecologi-
cally valid methodological approaches are therefore needed
to further clarify the nature of the pathways between self-
compassion and health suggested by this study.
Conclusion
Although self-compassion has been firmly established as
an asset for a wide range of desirable psychological out-
comes (MacBeth and Gumley, 2012; Neff et al., 2007b),
this study adds to the growing evidence that it also has ben-
efits for physical health. These benefits appear to accrue
primarily through the reduction in perceived stress that
occurs when people respond to their personal failures,
struggles, and difficult circumstances with a kind and for-
giving attitude, and secondarily through increased engage-
ment in health-promoting behaviors. Given the malleability
of self-compassion, our results suggest that interventions
cultivating self-compassion may be a fruitful direction for
future research seeking to identify ways to reduce stress,
increase health-promoting behaviors, and ultimately,
improve health.
