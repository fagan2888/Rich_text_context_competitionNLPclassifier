ABSTRACT
METZGER, J. S., D. J. CATELLIER, K. R. EVENSON, M. S. TREUTH, W. D. ROSAMOND and A. M. SIEGA-RIZ. Patterns of
Objectively Measured Physical Activity in the United States. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 40, No. 4, pp. 630­638, 2008. Purpose: We
used latent class analysis (LCA) to assess patterns of physical activity among adults, using the 7 d of accelerometer data from the 2003­
2004 NHANES. Methods: For each participant, we determined the daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA),
vigorous physical activity (VPA), and minutes of MVPA that occurred in bouts of 10 min. Participants were then categorized into
patterns of activity, using LCA and adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: For overall MVPA, five classes of physical
activity were defined, including two least active classes, which averaged less than 25 min of MVPA per day and represented 78.7% of
the total study population. The most active class averaged 134 min of MVPA per day and comprised 0.9% of the population. The
results for bout minutes of MVPA were similar to the patterns produced for overall MVPA, with the exception of a ``weekend warrior''
class with moderate levels of physical activity Monday through Friday but with a much higher level of activity on the weekend,
particularly on Sunday. This class represented 1.8% of the population. Only 1.4% of all days achieved 10 min or more of VPA, and in
91.1% of all days, participants accumulated less than 1 min of VPA. The LCA analysis of VPA did not produce stable results, because
of the small number of participants registering any minutes of VPA. Conclusion: Our results indicate that a very large portion of
the U.S. population may be classified into patterns of physical activity that represent low levels of MVPA throughout the week.
The LCA analysis provided a novel approach for assessing patterns of objectively measured physical activity in epidemiologic studies.

Because of the increased concern about the lack of
physical activity in the United States, many annual
national health surveys such as the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS) collect information on
physical activity levels. Reports and research from these
surveys cover various aspects of the nation`s levels of
physical activity (or inactivity), such as general physical
activity trends (12), trends among certain subpopulations
such as Hispanics (1), percent of the U.S. population
meeting the Healthy People 2010 leisure-time physical
activity goals (6), or associations between physical activity
and health care expenditures (26). These reports, however,
have in the past relied on self-report, which, when
compared with objectively measured physical activity, have
been shown to have low correlations in the range of 0.14­
0.53 (24). In addition, participants are generally categorized
into activity levels on the basis of overall descriptions of
activity frequency and intensity, without attempting to
categorize the potential differences in the pattern of
accumulated physical activity over time.
In the 2003­2004 National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES), physical activity as measured by
accelerometry was added to the battery of assessments
among those participants 6 yr old and older who were
ambulatory, providing the first nationally representative
sample of objectively measured physical activity in the
United States. In addition, the accelerometry data were
collected during a 7-d period, allowing for an assessment of
the number of minutes of physical activity accumulated by
each participant on each day of a 7-d week.
Using latent class analysis (LCA), we assessed whether
patterns, or classes, of physical activity exist among adults
in this sample during the 7-d period. In this type of analysis,
a specified number of classes are requested a priori. Then,
LCA finds the requested number of best-fitting, underlying
normal distributions for the indicators of these classes (in
this case, the daily minutes of physical activity across the

7 d of a week). For example, one class may have a very low
mean number of minutes of physical activity from Monday
to Friday, with a high average number of minutes of
physical activity on Saturday and Sunday (i.e., a ``weekend
warrior''). Another group, possibly active workers, may
have a large mean number of minutes of physical activity
during the work week but low mean minutes of physical
activity on the weekend.
A recent study attempted to assess the effect of the
weekend warrior activity pattern on the risk of mortality
(14). In this study, the mortality outcomes of the weekend
warrior, defined as those who accumulate a large quantity
of physical activity (Q 1000 kcalIwkj1) during a short
period of time (1­2 dIwkj1), were compared with those
who accumulate a similar amount of activity (Q 1000
kcalIwkj1) for a longer period of time (3+ dIwkj1), along
with those who are insufficiently active (500­999
kcalIwkj1) or sedentary (G 500 kcalIwkj1). Among low-
risk men, defined as nonsmokers, BMI G 25 kgImj2, no
history of hypertension, and without hypercholesterolemia,
weekend warriors demonstrated the lowest relative risk of
mortality, indicating that as long as the accumulated
physical activity is sufficient, then the benefits will be
accrued. Among high-risk men, defined as having any of
the above risk factors, only the regularly active showed
improved mortality risks as compared with the most
sedentary group.
Much is now known about the overall levels of activity in
the United States, but few studies have attempted to define
patterns of physical activity. The pattern in which individ-
uals accumulate their physical activity can be highly
variable. To meet the recommended guidelines of 30
minIdj1 for 5 dIwkj1 (150 minIwkj1) (23), activity could
be undertaken in various ways. For example, one could be
physically active all 7 d for a defined duration (~20
minIdj1), whereas another individual may be physically
active twice per week at a much longer duration (70 min
each). In both cases, the cumulative time spent in activity is
the same (140 minIwkj1). Varying the intensity of the
activity could also influence activity patterns. Using LCA
may help highlight strategies for how inactive people may
accumulate additional physical activity, such as by adopting
a weekend warrior pattern of activity. In addition, LCA may
allow future analysis to assess whether different patterns of
physical activity are associated with improved health
outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We analyzed the 2003­2004 NHANES, an ongoing,
nationally representative health survey with a target
population of civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. citizens.
Certain populations were oversampled, including low-
income persons, Mexican Americans, African Americans,
and those ages 12­19 and 60 yr or older. The survey
consists of an interview, from which sociodemographic
information is collected, and a physical examination, from
which various biological markers of health are ascertained.
In addition, the 2003­2004 NHANES collected seven
consecutive days of accelerometry measurements among
all ambulatory participants 6 yr old and older who agreed to
wear the monitor for a week. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
Measuring Physical Activity with Accelerometry
Accelerometers are small, electronic devices that record
the acceleration of change in bodily motion, either in one
plane or in multidimensions. They are particularly useful in
measuring physical activity because they eliminate the
potential for recall bias and social desirability bias, and
they do not depend on literacy. NHANES 2003­2004 used
the ActiGraph Model 7164 accelerometer manufactured by
ActiGraph (formerly MTI/CSA) to collect information on
participants` physical activity. This lightweight, uniaxial
monitor is a technically reliable instrument, both within and
across monitors (18). NHANES used 1-min epochs to
assign a ``count'' value, a relative measure of the changes in
momentum that occurred during these periods, which may
then be translated into an estimate of physical activity
intensity.
Moderate and Vigorous Physical Activity Cut
Points Based on Calibration Studies
The accelerometer cut point used by this study to
translate the count value into an estimate of moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was based on a
weighted average of published cut points for adults
(3,9,15,27) in accordance with the recommendation of
NHANES researchers. Each study listed in Table 1 reports
a cut point for MVPA, and these were then weighted by
their sample sizes to arrive at an N-weighted average cut
point of 2020 counts per minute for MVPA. Cut points for

vigorous physical activity (VPA) were also reported in
these calibration studies, and, using the same N-weighted
average as used with the MVPA, the VPA cut point was
5999 counts per minute.
Accumulating Minutes of MVPA and/or VPA
Physical activity accumulated in a given day was
quantified as 1) minutes per day in which the count was
higher than the given MVPA cut point, 2) minutes per day
in which the count was higher than the given VPA cut
point, and 3) minutes per day of MVPA accumulated in
bouts of 10 min or more. The latter classification was
motivated by the physical activity recommendations pub-
lished by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the American College of Sports Medicine
(ACSM) (23), which call for activity to be accumulated in
bouts of 10 min or more to achieve health benefits. To
allow for brief periods of rest common during activities--
for example, to pause for a water break while playing
basketball--the criteria used to define a bout required a
running average of 70% of the counts to be above the cut
point. Once the series of accelerometer minutes fell below
70% of minutes in MVPA, the bout was considered over.
Thus, bout minutes of MVPA were a sum of all minutes of
MVPA accumulated in these bouts. Those who never
achieved a 10-min bout were assigned their longest bout
shorter than 10 min in length. Bout minutes of VPA were
not assessed, because too few participants achieved the
required 10 consecutive minutes of VPA.
Imputation of Missing Daily Minutes of MVPA
and/or VPA
Even though accelerometer data were present for most
days, within each day there may be extended periods of
zero counts, indicating either a nonwearing period or a
period with no detectable movement. Periods consisting of
1 h or more of consecutive zeros were treated as missing
data. In addition, periods of monitor malfunctioning were
also considered missing (e.g., 10 min of identical consec-
utive nonzero count values). After dividing each day into
segments corresponding roughly to nighttime (midnight to
6:00), daytime (6:00 to 17:00), early evening (17:00 to
21:00), and late evening (21:00 to midnight), data were then
imputed using the expectation maximization (EM) algo-
rithm, an iterative imputation technique that uses the values
of an individual`s other, nonmissing data as predictors to
estimate the expected value of the total minutes of MVPA/
VPA for each missing segment of time (4). Imputation was
only performed for those participants providing one or more
days of complete data, and remaining participants were
excluded. Given this strategy, 88.5% of the population had
at least one time segment imputed on at least 1 d, but 49.7%
of the population had no time segments imputed for four or
more days; overall, this only led to the imputation of 20.6%
of the total time across all days.
Self-Reported Variables
Age was recorded at the time of the interview, and those
over 85 yr of age were assigned a truncated value of 85. For
descriptive purposes, age was categorized into decades but
was left continuous in the final LCA. Gender was recorded
at the time of interview. Race, ethnicity, and country-of-
origin questions were recoded into the following categories:
1) Mexican American, 2) other Hispanic, 3) Non-Hispanic
(NH) black, 4) NH white, and 5) other race, including
multiracial. Education was categorized as less than high
school, high school or GED, and more than high school.
The poverty income ratio (PIR) was recorded as a ratio of
the self-reported family income to the poverty threshold
based on family size. The smallest value of 0 indicated no
family income, and the highest value was truncated at 5,
indicating a family income at least five times the poverty
threshold for family size. For descriptive purposes, the
poverty ratio was categorized into integer values but was
left continuous in the final class analysis.
Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics. One thousand two hundred
thirty-nine participants from our base study population were
excluded because of missing covariate information or
because their accelerometer data were missing or invalid
(no days of adherent wear time). To determine whether the
analysis sample differed from the subgroup excluded
because of missing/invalid data, we used chi-square tests
to compare categorical variables, and we used t-tests to
compare the mean of continuous variables. Using SAS
(Cary, NC) survey procedures, sample weighted means,
standard deviations, standard errors, and 25th, 50th, and
75th percentiles were computed for overall MVPA, bout
minutes of MVPA, and VPA for each day of the week. To
account for item nonresponse, the sampling weights were
reweighted within strata of age (20­34, 35­49, 50­64, and
65+), gender, and race (Mexican, NH black, and white/
other) (21).
Latent class analysis. Employing LCA, we used each
participant`s 7 d of total MVPA/VPA to determine whether
natural groupings, or classes, of people exist who tend to
accumulate their minutes of physical activity in a similar
pattern during the 7 d. Classes can be thought of as groups
of people who share similar means for the various indicators
of class--in this case, the 7 d of accumulated MVPA/VPA.

the LCA model is as follows:

On the left side of this equation, the probability distribution
function defines a distribution for y, the vector of minutes
of MVPA/VPA across the 7 d, conditioned on K(5), the
vector of mean MVPA across the 7 d, and 3(5), the
covariance matrix for the multivariate normal distribution of

the 7 d. On the right side, for each underlying class
(indexed by G), the probability function for the vector y is
weighted by probability of being in the each of these
specific classes. Kg
(5) is the vector of predicted means for
the gth group, and 3g
(5) is the covariance matrix for the
gth group. The overall probability distribution for y is, thus,
a probability-weighted sum of each class`s probability
density for the given values of y (7).
If the distribution f is assumed to be a multivariate
normal distribution with G components, then the probability
density function of an individual in the Gth class is

where yi
is the vector of minutes of MVPA/VPA across the
seven times for the ith subject, Kg

predicted means across the seven times t for the ith subject,
3g
(5) is the covariance matrix for the multivariate normal
distribution of the 7 d of MVPA/VPA, and |3g
(5)| is the
determinant of the covariance matrix (7).
Thus, the likelihood function used to maximize this
model for all participants across all class possibilities is

where N indexes the subjects and G indexes the classes,
and, again, the pi
weights the probability function for the
gth class. This likelihood function is identical to the
multivariate normal distribution with the addition of the
probability-weighted class memberships (2).
The probability of being a member of a particular class is
assigned to an individual according to Bayesian posterior
probabilities, using a prior probability proportional to the
size of the particular class relative to the entire population.

where Pg
is the prior probability of being in class g,
conditioned on the covariates. The numerator in this case is
the prior probability that subject i belongs to class g,
multiplied by the probability density for the observed 7 d
of MVPA for yi
, given the predicted means and covariance of
the 7 d of MVPA in class g. The denominator is the sum of
the probability densities for all possible class memberships
given the individual`s set of indicator values yi
, weighted by
each class`s specific prior probability (11). Individuals were
assigned to the class with their highest posterior probability
of class membership, referred to as modal allocation.
Selecting the number of classes. One of the most
difficult tasks of LCA is determining the proper number of
classes that adequately describe the population without
overspecifying the number of class groupings, thereby
losing the interpretative value of the classes. Several criteria
were used to select the appropriate number of classes. We
first used the bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT), which
compares the fit of k classes to k j 1 classes, because it
outperformed the Lo­Mendell­Rubin likelihood ratio (16)
in controlling both type I and type II error (22). Second, we
considered a measure referred to as ``entropy'' that is the
average highest predicted probability of class membership
(20). This measure ranges from 0 to 1, with lower entropy
indicating little confidence that individuals belong in the
class with their highest assigned probability, whereas an
entropy of 1 would indicate certainty that individuals
belong in their assigned class. Third, if one or more class
sizes were too small to be of any public health relevance,
the number of classes was reduced. Finally, substantive
knowledge was used to establish the appropriate number of
classes (19). There should be a correspondence between the
established classes and some practical interpretation of what
the classes indicate. As Muthen (the author of the MPLUS
statistical software) concludes, ``Substantive theory,
auxiliary information, and practical usefulness will continue
to have to guide the statistical analysis'' (19).
Specifying Variance Estimates
In a completely unrestricted model, LCA will estimate a
separate variance­covariance matrix for each class. If the
number of latent classes or the number of variables is large,
so are the parameters to be estimated. Thus, a typical
strategy is to impose restrictions, such as constraining
covariances to zero or constraining classes to have the same
variance­covariance matrix (i.e., 3g
(5) = 3(5)). Con-
strained models allow for more parsimonious and stable
results (11).
Because the mean minutes of physical activity for the
lowest activity class had significantly lower variances than
in the more active classes, a model that allowed this lowest
activity class to have variances that differed from all of the
other activity classes was selected. For all but the lowest
activity class, we allowed weekend and weekday variances
to differ, but we constrained them to be equal across
classes. In this way, we tried to create a parsimonious,
stable model that still captured some of the complexity of
the substantive issues of the analysis.
The LCA was performed using MPLUS. The modeling
was conducted by requesting a range from 1 to 6 classes a
priori as the number of group memberships to predict.
Beyond six classes, the sample size of the more active
classes became very small, and the activity patterns during
the 7 d became highly unstable. Whereas MPLUS allows
for complex survey sampling in conjunction with LCA
modeling, the software does not currently account for
survey sampling when computing the BLRT statistic. As
such, this analysis, designed to establish an appropriate

number of activity classes, was performed without sample
weights and cluster sampling.
Structural Equation Modeling Perspective
Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the LCA
model using the graphic presentation typical of structural
equation modeling. In this perspective, the latent classes
(represented by circles) are derived from the patterns of
physical activity across the 7 d of the week (squares indicate
observed variables). Simultaneously, the sociodemographic
characteristics are used to help predict who falls into each of
the derived activity classes by providing more refined prior
probabilities based on the distribution of the sociodemo-
graphic characteristics within each class. The Bayesian
posterior class membership probabilities are then based on
these prior probabilities. Because the reporting of the direct
effects of the sociodemographics on class membership is
complicated and beyond the scope of the current analyses,
these results will be presented in future work.
This research was approved by the public health institu-
tional review board of the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
RESULTS
A total of 10,122 participants completed the 2003­2004
NHANES physical examination. We excluded those under
age 20, to more clearly focus this research on an adult
population. Of the remaining 5041 participants, 4252
provided data for the accelerometer portion of the survey.
Finally, an additional 450 participants were excluded
because of missing covariate data (e.g., education, house-
hold income) or because they had no days of valid
accelerometer data with which to impute the other, missing
days, leaving a final population of 3802 participants.
Because imputation was not performed on the assessment
of bout minutes of MVPA, only the 3462 participants who
provided at least three valid days of data were included in
the analysis of bout minutes.

The sociodemographic characteristics of the final sample
and those excluded because of missing data are presented in
Table 2. Statistically significant (P G 0.05) differences were
found between the categorical distributions of age, education,
the poverty index, and race/ethnicity. Whereas the chi-square
tests for the categorized age and poverty index ratio were
significant, the t-tests for the continuous age (P value = 0.82)
and poverty index ratio (P value = 0.21) were not. For age,
this seems to be attributable to the missing data being
overrepresented by the younger and older participants in the
various age categories, leading to a similar mean age (50.8 yr
old for those in the final sample vs 51.0 yr old for those not
included in the final sample). Similarly, for the poverty index,
the poorest and richest were least likely to provide complete
data, again leading to a similar mean (2.6 for those in the
final sample vs 2.5 for those not included in the final sample).
The weighted median minutes of MVPA/VPA and bout
minutes of MVPA are presented in Table 3 by day of the
week. The median number of minutes of overall MVPA
ranged from 17.0 on Monday and Tuesday to 12.0 on Sunday,
whereas the median minutes for overall VPA were zero for all
days but Tuesday and Thursday. Bout minutes of MVPA had
a median of 2.0 for all days. The median values were
substantially lower than the mean for all types of physical
activity and for all days of the week, suggesting nonnormally
distributed data, but the means and standard deviations are
presented for comparison with other published data.
The analyses of the class memberships for the overall
minutes of MVPA produced a BLRT test statistic that
detected a statistically significant improvement in fitness at
the G 0.0001 level for all numbers of classes, ranging from 1
to 6. This indicates that separating the population into six
classes was justified on the basis on these criteria. Whereas
entropy decreased as the number of classes increased, it was
still high (0.94) for five and six classes. Because the six-class
analysis resulted in very small active classes, we settled on a
more parsimonious, five-class model for presentation.
Figure 2 shows the plot of the mean minutes of total
accumulated MVPA for five classes. The largest sample-
weighted percentage of the population fell into the lowest
two classes--roughly 79% of the total population. These
two lowest classes encompassed activity averaging less than
25 minIdj1 of MVPA. The highest activity class, with a
mean of 134 min of MVPA per day, only constituted 0.9%
of the population. This class also demonstrated a high level
of activity Monday through Friday, with less activity on the
weekend, with a particularly pronounced decrease on
Sunday. All classes demonstrated this dip on weekends
compared with weekends, to varying degrees.
When participants were required to accumulate their
minutes in bouts, the BLRT test justified as many as six
classes at the G 0.0001 level; however, the two most active
classes were very sparsely populated (0.4% and 0.5% of the
population). Given this, we settled on five classes, which
also allowed for a direct comparison with the overall
minutes of MVPA. Figure 3 shows the class means for

To account for item nonresponse, the sampling weights were reweighted within strata of age (20­34, 35­49, 50­64, and 65+), gender, and race (Mexican, NH­black, and white/other).
* A participant was only credited for physical activity that occurred in bouts of 10 min or more in length. Bouts were based on a running average of 70% of the counts above the MVPA cut point of 2020 counts per minute. If no bouts of at least
10 min in length were accumulated in a particular day, the participant was credited with his or her longest bout shorter than 10 min in that day.

the five-class results for the bout minutes of MVPA. The
two most active classes represented 0.6% and 4.0% of the
sample-weighted population, just slightly less than the two
most active overall MVPA classes, which had 0.9% and
4.5% of the population, respectively. Roughly 93.5% of the
entire population is now classified into the lowest two
groups. In addition, for the bout analysis, the second-least-
active group now has a mean of 10.3 bout minutes of
MVPA per day, whereas the second-least-active group in
the overall MVPA analysis had a mean of 21.0 min across
all 7 d. Thus, when only bout minutes are counted, a much
larger percentage of the population was classified into the
lowest groups, and these groups are less active.
Even though the number of minutes accumulated in bouts
tends to shift the classes into lower levels of mean activity
level, the general patterns are very similar to the overall
MVPA analysis, with one exception. A class emerged with
moderate levels of physical activity Monday through
Friday, but with a much higher level of activity on the
weekend, particularly on Sunday. This class, representing
1.8% of the population, will be referred to as the ``weekend
warrior'' class. The six-class analysis of the overall minutes
of MVPA (data not shown) also demonstrated this weekend
warrior class, although with a smaller percentage of the
population (0.9%).
The VPA analysis did not produce stable results (very
large and very small class sizes), because of the very low
number of participants accumulating any VPA. For exam-
ple, both the three- and four-class VPA analyses produced a
most active class with only two and one participants,
respectively--a trivial class assignment from both a
substantive and analytical perspective.
DISCUSSION
This modeling represents the first time that objectively
measured physical activity data have been analyzed using
LCA. Whereas a large portion of the population presented
little activity, a weekend warrior class did emerge, as did a
highly active class with less activity on the weekend. We
are unsure whether these activity patterns were driven by
specific types of activity, such as work-related activities.
In the analysis of the overall minutes of MVPA, the
statistical significance of the BLRT statistic indicated that
six classes were justified on the basis of the data. However,
class size for the more active groups displayed a small
sample size, and, as such, the reduced model with only five
classes provided a more parsimonious model.
An inactive class emerged in overall MVPA that
represented nearly 34% of the entire population. This class
averaged 5.3 min of MVPA per day. The second-least-
active class, with a mean of 21.0 min of MVPA per day,
also represents a class of which many, if not most, would
not have accumulated 30 min of MPVA on most days of the
week. Together, these two groups represent a very large
proportion of the population with PA levels significantly
below the recommended levels (23). Determining the
sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of these
groups, to target appropriate physical activity interventions,
could lead to significant improvements in activity levels in
the United States and, thus, in the overall health of the
nation.
The analysis of the bout minutes of MVPA produced
patterns similar to those found in the analysis of the overall
minutes of MVPA, with the important exception of the
weekend warrior class. From Monday through Friday, this
class had significantly less activity than the class above it
(e.g., the class representing 4.0% of the population), but
because of the significant increase in physical activity of the
weekend warriors on Saturday and Sunday, and the decrease
in the other group during this period, their means were
relatively similar. The weekend warriors accumulated a daily
mean of 31.5 min of MVPA, whereas the more active group

was only slightly more active, averaging 37.0 min. The
health outcomes of these two groups would be interesting to
compare, because they represent two populations that both
achieved the recommended minimum total accumulation of
MVPA, accumulated their minutes in bouts, and have similar
mean minutes of MVPA, although they accumulated their
MVPA minutes in very different manners.
A recent article using self-report data from NHANES and
the BRFSS reports a prevalence of the weekend warrior
pattern in the U.S. population--defined as accumulating Q
150 min of MVPA on 1 or 2 d in a week--of approximately
3% and 1%, respectively (13). Our results, although based
on objectively measured accelerometer data, found that a
similar proportion of the population (1.8%) could be
classified as weekend warriors according to bout minutes
of MVPA.
Another important difference between bout minutes of
MVPA and the analysis of overall MVPA minutes is that
the more active groups in the bout-minutes analysis had
significantly fewer participants than in the overall MVPA
analysis. In fact, the two most active classes in the six-class
analysis of bout minutes of MVPA (data not shown) only
contained 0.4% and 0.5% of the population. The utility of
class assignments with such small populations is an
important consideration in mixture modeling, especially if
the analyses include associations between class assignment
and any outcomes. If the six class levels of bout minutes of
MVPA were used to simultaneously model health out-
comes, the two most active classes would likely not be large
enough to generate proper associations with the health
outcomes, particularly if the outcomes were rare.
This challenge was made most explicit in the analysis of
the VPA. Only 1.4% of all days had 10 min or more of VPA,
and in 91.1% of all days, participants accumulated less than
1 min of VPA (data not shown). Because of the highly
skewed data, the model assumptions generally failed to pro-
duce results. When classes were successfully modeled, their
sizes were too small to serve any useful analytic purposes.
These low levels of VPA are troubling when considered
in light of the Healthy People 2010 goals of increasing to
30% ``the proportion of the adults who engage in vigorous
physical activity that promotes the development and
maintenance of cardiorespiratory fitness three or more days
per week for 20 or more minutes per occasion'' (25). Not
only does this analysis reflect a much lower percentage of
the adult population achieving this goal than desired, it also
reflects a much lower percentage than the 27.4% of adults
reported to have met this goal in 2005 by the BRFSS (5). In
fact, only 23 participants registered 20 min of VPA on at
least 3 dIwkj1, representing only 0.9% of the sample-
weighted total population. Because the BRFSS assessment
was based on self-report, this discrepancy could reflect a
large amount of overreporting present in the BRFSS levels.
It could also reflect that the cut point for VPA was too high,
thereby missing many minutes of activity in our population
that should have been classified as VPA.
Although we chose LCA as our modeling strategy, other
possibilities were also considered for the method of
modeling classes. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA)
and growth mixture modeling (GMM) have recently found
wide application in the social sciences as an effective
method for modeling growth trajectories with longitudinal
data (8,10). It was determined, however, that the 7 d of PA,
although contiguous in time, did not constitute a longitudi-
nal analysis analogous to, for example, the development of
childhood obesity according to age in adolescence. This
decision was based, in part, on the desire to impose no
restrictions on the shape of the classes across 7 d. In other
words, we did not want to force the physical activity classes
to follow a ``growth'' pattern. With this conceptualization,
physical activity is more analogous to multiple continuous
measurements of academic ability such as math, verbal,
spatial, etc., and, as such, it should be modeled with LCA.
One question that remains from the LCA is whether any
relevant undetected patterns exist that may have been
missed by this analysis. For example, although many
people work Monday through Friday, others do not;
therefore, their ``weekend'' may fall on days other than
Saturday and Sunday. Other missed groups may include
active workers who work weekends but do not work some
days during the normal work week, or those who participate
in leisure-time activity every other day. Future analysis may
choose to order days differently, such as by least to most
activity, instead of by day of the week, leading to a class
analysis that would still capture overall activity but would
better assess the regularity of activity. Depending on the
purpose of the analysis, this or other strategies may provide
preferred results.
Several limitations of this work are worth noting. The
analysis population had a sociodemographic distribution
that differed from those who were excluded because of
nonresponse or inappropriate data, which, in turn, could
have affected the overall patterns found. Another weakness
was that, because of the small number of participants
registering sufficient levels of VPA, this part of the analysis
was unsuccessful. This would have been an interesting
group to assess, and, possibly, with different analytical
techniques or a larger study population, such an analysis
will be possible in the future. Accelerometers do not capture
all types of physical activity, particularly static activities
such as raking leaves or riding a bike (17). Therefore,
although the current analyses do not rely on self-report, they
may still not reflect the true activity levels of the U.S.
population. Similarly, the cut points for what constitutes
MVPA and VPA are also sensitive to the types of activities
being done. Changing these cut points would affect the
amount of physical activity that participants were credited
for, which, in turn, could have affected the outcomes of the
latent class analysis. An analytical weakness worth noting
was that the BLRT test statistic was not available with the
simultaneous use of the NHANES sample weights, and,
therefore, the sample weights were not used for this

analysis. Adding the sample weights could have affected
the final decision for the number of classes as well as the
pattern that these classes assumed.
These data represent objectively measured physical activ-
ity from a large, nationally representative sample of the U.S.
population. Physical activity was assessed in several ways, to
analyze the class membership patterns for different patterns
of physical activity. Our results indicate that a very large
portion of the U.S. population may be classified into patterns
of physical activity that represent low levels of MVPA
throughout the week. The levels of VPA were most
surprising, indicating that fewer than 1% of the population
engaged in VPA for at least 20 min on three or more days
per week. In addition, a weekend warrior class emerged for
approximately 2% of the population. The LCA analysis
provides a novel approach for assessing patterns of objec-
tively measured physical activity in epidemiologic studies.
