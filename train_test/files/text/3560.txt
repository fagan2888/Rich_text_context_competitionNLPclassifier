Adolescence is a period of initiation and discovery, with an
increased potential for adolescents to experiment for the first
time with activities that could have long-term effects on their
heath (Fang, Schinke, & Cole, 2009). Promoting healthy
sexual behaviors during adolescence is recognized as the
most cost-effective way to reduce risky behaviors and mini-
mize the medical costs and health consequences of sexually
transmitted infections (STIs; Berlan & Holland-Hall, 2010;
Di Noia & Schinke, 2008; Hendershot, Magnan, & Bryan,
2010). Within the context of family ecology perspectives
(Granic, 2006), parent­child interactions reflect an interper-
sonal relationship of relatively long-term duration, with par-
ents and families representing a significant and generally
stable influence in adolescents' lives. Studies (Chen,
Dornbusch, & Liu, 2007; Markham et al., 2003) have shown
that although peers' sexual behaviors play an important role
in adolescents' decisions to initiate sexual intercourse, par-
ents are the primary source of information about sex, and
most importantly, that adolescents are influenced by their
parents' attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, positive par-
enting skills and close maternal relationships are signifi-
cantly protective against adolescents' associations with
deviant peers and engagement in risky behaviors (Carroll et
al., 2009; Lopez et al., 2009; Prado, Pantin, Schwartz, Lupei,
& Szapocznik, 2006; Wagner et al., 2010). Positive parental
role-modeling, parental monitoring, perceived connected-
ness, and general communication have been shown to be
positively associated with less frequent sexual activities,
later sexual initiation, and fewer teenage pregnancies among
adolescents (Koniak-Griffin, Lesser, Uman, & Nyamathi,
2003). Ultimately, parental influence established via con-
stant, prolonged interactions between parents and children is
recognized as the primary influence on adolescents' sexual
attitudes and behaviors (Kao, Loveland-Cherry, & Guthrie,
2010; Kao, Lupia, & Clemen-Stone, 2014; Kao & Manczak,
2013).
The expectancy violation­realignment model (Collins &
Luebker, 1994), derived from symbolic interactionism
(Blumer, 1969), is frequently used to explain interactions
that occur throughout the parent­child relationship. The
model posits that adolescents perceive parental expectancies
about behaviors through constant, dyadic parent­child inter-
actions. During times of transition and development,

Comparing White and Asian American
Adolescents' Perceived Parental
Expectations and Their Sexual Behaviors
Tsui-Sui Annie Kao1 and Kristy K. Martyn2
Abstract
While parental influences on adolescent health behaviors are well recognized, there is limited understanding of the relationship
between adolescents' perceptions of their parents' expectations and their sexual behaviors. This mixed-methods study
explored how White and Asian American adolescents perceive parental expectations via parent­child interactions, and how
such expectations relate to adolescents' self-reported sexual activities over time. Using gender-matched, in-depth interviews
with 28 White and Asian American adolescents, ages 17 to 19, we explored adolescents' perceptions of parental expectations
about when, how, and under what conditions adolescents should engage in sexual activity. Stronger conservative parental
sexual expectations and disapproving parental attitudes were closely related to later sexual debut and fewer sexual partners.
Perceived closeness determined the degree to which adolescents respected and incorporated their parents' beliefs, values,
and sexual expectations. Future research should focus on developing family strategies to utilize the concept of perceived
parental expectations.

expectations may be violated and realigned. The conflict that
can result may lead to a subsequent realignment of the expec-
tation, leading to a shift in behavior and/or the expectation by
the adolescent, parent, or both parties. This is a cyclical,
complex process. As such, the perceived expectations
derived from these interactions are not yet fully understood,
particularly when considered within the context of culture
and family (Kao, Guthrie, & Loveland-Cherry, 2007; Kao et
al., 2010).
In an effort to operationalize the concept of perceived
parental expectations, this study seeks to understand how
parents influence their adolescents' sexual attitudes and
behaviors. Thus far, models designed to generate protective
effects via the utilization of family strengths are limited.
Some studies have investigated the effects of parent­child
communication on adolescents'risky behaviors (Hutchinson,
2002; Lac et al., 2011), but their results are not consistent
(Guilamo-Ramos, Jaccard, Dittus, & Collins, 2008; Kao et
al., 2010; McKee et al., 2007; Wight, Williamson, &
Henderson, 2006). Ineffective parental communication is
often attributed to delayed discussion, lack of in-depth dis-
cussion (Fang & Schinke, 2013; Ryan, Franzetta, Manlove,
& Holcombe, 2007), or inconsistent reports of discussion
between parents and adolescent (McElhaney, Porter,
Thompson, & Allen, 2008; Villarruel, Loveland-Cherry, &
Ronis, 2010). Inconsistencies are especially notable across
cultural or gender groups, where effects varied due to
endorsed familial and/or parental values. For example, Chao
(2000) noted that definitions of the term parenting varied
among immigrant Chinese and European American parents.
In particular, immigrant Chinese mothers emphasized the
concept of socializing, or training, children to become
responsible citizens, a concept that overlaps with Baumrind's
(1966) definition of authoritarian parenting, but does not
align entirely. Ultimately, Chao emphasized the significance
of conceptualizing and measuring the role culture plays in
parenting style and practices.
Family strengths and efficacies often reside in a family's
traditions, heritage, cultural and religious beliefs, and are
transmitted from one generation to another through parent­
child interactions (Bandura, Caprara, Barbaranelli, Regalia,
& Scabini, 2011; Hwang, & Wood, 2009; Liu & Goto, 2007;
Schwartz & Zamboanga, 2008). During adolescent develop-
mental transitions, families reframe and redefine what their
essential values are by establishing family boundaries--that
is, by establishing which behaviors or actions are considered
healthy or safe (Kao et al., 2014; S. Y. Kim, Chen, Li, Huang,
& Moon, 2009; Tsai-Chae & Nagata, 2008; Wilson, 2009).
These parental expectations may be communicated in a vari-
ety of ways, including via non-verbal or indirection commu-
nication. Furthermore, patterns of parent­child interactions
may differ according to an adolescent's developmental stage,
needs, prior experience, and other factors such as gender,
culture, and social orientation. Some gender differences are
noted in adolescents' dyadic relationships with their mothers
versus their fathers (Lac et al., 2011 Markham et al., 2003).
Ultimately, the style, depth, and effect of parent­child com-
munication may play an essential role in an adolescent's per-
ception of parental expectations (Kao et al., 2007; Kao et al.,
2010). In a community-based study of 1,083 youth aged 13
to 17, adolescents were much less likely to have initiated
sexual intercourse if parents taught their children refusal
skills, communicated about family values, and set clear fam-
ily boundaries (Aspy et al., 2007; Fang & Schinke, 2013).
Simply urging parents to talk with their youth about sex may
not be sufficient (Bersamin et al., 2008; Kao et al., 2010)--
the breadth, depth, meaning, and repetition of sexual topics
may be essential (Martino, Elliott, Corona, Kanouse, &
Schuster, 2008; Kao et al., 2014).
Indirect and non-verbal communication has been found to
be particularly significant among Asian American families
(Kao & Salerno, 2014; Tsai-Chae & Nagata, 2008), as their
societal and cultural norms about parenting styles and prac-
tices may be different from that of the dominant Western cul-
ture. Asian American or other minority parents may be more
likely to employ indirect or non-verbal practices such as
role-modeling, monitoring, and disapproving attitudes. In
one mixed-methods study, J. L. Kim and Ward (2007)
explored perceptions of parental sexual communication pat-
terns among 165 Asian American college students.
Participants reported that parents often used implicit, non-
verbal ways to communicate sexual values. Male partici-
pants reported minimal paternal communication.
Overall, there are limited studies available to understand
how Asian American adolescents' sexual behaviors are
related to their perceived parental expectations. Sexuality
and sexual health are often seen as taboo topics among Asian
American families (Kao et al., 2007). Fang, Barnes-Ceeney,
and Schinke (2011) have suggested that Asian American
adolescent girls face increasing health risks because they
confront developmental tasks and challenges associated with
bridging two different cultures. Acculturation gaps between
Asian parents and their adolescents, for example, might
compromise the effectiveness of parental sexual communi-
cation. Furthermore, the misperception that Asian American
youth are a trouble-free "model minority" creates additional
barriers, harassment, and risks for healthy behaviors
(Grunbaum, Lowery, Kann, & Pateman, 2000; Qin, Way, &
Rana, 2008). Research has found that while Asian American
adolescents tend to delay sexual onset, once they become
sexually active, their risk for STIs and HIV/AIDS is similar
to that of adolescents from other racial/ethnic groups (Hahm,
Lahiff, & Barreto, 2006). Furthermore, while Asian
Americans account for only about 2% of the total number of
HIV/AIDS cases in the United States, the number of HIV/
AIDS diagnoses among this population has increased steadily
in recent years, particularly for gay, bisexual, and otherAsian
men who have sex with men (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention [CDC], 2013). This number may be underes-
timated, misidentified, or underreported; Asian Americans
Kao and Martyn 3
screen for HIV at lower rates, and AIDS diagnoses are often
made late in the course of disease (CDC, 2013).
In an effort to understand how adolescents' sexual behav-
iors are related to their perceived parental expectations as
derived from parent­child interactions, this study explores
the role familial beliefs and values play in adolescent percep-
tions of parental expectations, and how these perceptions of
parental expectations relate to adolescents' self-reported
sexual activities over time with a group of Asian American
and White adolescents. White American adolescents serve as
an excellent reference group for examination of Asian
American sexual behaviors. The literature has examined
White adolescent sexual behavior (Aspy et al., 2007; Kao,
Gibbs, Clemen-Stone, & Duffy, 2013; Klein & White, 1996;
Reitman, Rhode, Hupp, & Altobello, 2002) with greater fre-
quency than that of Asian American adolescents. Similar to
Asian American adolescents, however, White adolescents
are generally perceived and reported to engage in risky
behaviors at lower rates than other racial/ethnic groups, such
as Hispanic and African American adolescents (CDC, 2013).
Inclusion of White adolescents also provided an opportunity
to reference two populations with similar education levels
and family income (Mau, 1997).
To operationalize the concept of perceived parental
expectations, it is necessary to consider adolescent perspec-
tives about when and under what condition adolescents
believe their parents might permit or expect them to have
sex. Adolescent perception of parental sexual attitudes--
how upset an adolescent believes his or her parents would be
if the adolescent was to have sex--should also be consid-
ered. This study explored three research questions:
Research Question 1: What are adolescents' perceptions
of parental expectations for their sexual behaviors?
Research Question 2: How are parental expectations
constructed within the context of familial beliefs?
Research Question 3: What are the patterns of associa-
tion between adolescents' perceptions of parental expec-
tations and their self-reported sexual behaviors over time?
Method
This mixed-methods (Creswell, 2007; Plano Clark,
Huddleston-Casas, Churchill, O'Neil Green, & Garrett,
2008), cross-sectional study utilized semi-structured qualita-
tive interviews and quantitative event history calendars, or
EHCs (Martyn & Belli, 2002), to assess how adolescents'
perceptions of interactions with their parents relate to per-
ceived parental expectations, and how such expectations
relate to their self-reported sexual behaviors over time.
Sample
Our sample included 28 adolescents who self-identified as
either White or Asian American. Adolescents of other racial/
ethnic backgrounds were excluded. We purposefully strati-
fied our sample by ethnic background, age, and gender. The
age criteria (ages 17-19) allowed us to assess adolescents'
personal activities over the prior 4 years, starting when they
were 13 to 15 years old. We included only adolescents who
had resided in the United States for 10 or more years, to
ensure that participants recalled experiences that occurred
while living within the United States. Our sample included
13 White, 13 Asian American, and 2 mixed-race (Asian and
White) adolescents, with a mean age of 17.91 years (SD =
0.82 years). Participants lived in suburban areas on the out-
skirts of a major metropolitan area in the Midwest. Most ado-
lescents resided with two parents and were from middle- to
high-income families. Roughly, 40% of participants were
enrolled in high school; 60% were enrolled in 2- or 4-year
colleges.
Recruitment
All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the
University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. To
maintain consistency, two research assistants were trained
on study procedures, including interviewing, EHC assess-
ments, and human subject protocols, prior to conducting
prescreening and interviews. During the prescreening pro-
cess, research assistants provided prospective participants
with study information and their rights as study subjects,
and conducted an eligibility interview. Potential partici-
pants below the age of 18 were informed of the need for
parental consent. Parental consent was obtained via a con-
sent letter mailed to the parents' home. To address poten-
tial language barriers, translation services and/or in-person
explanations of the study were offered to potential partici-
pants and their parents. (Neither service was requested.)
All adolescents were fluent in English. Adolescents who
were 18 years and older provided informed consent prior
to their interviews. Audio files, consent/assent documents,
and keys linking participants' identity with their study
information were stored in a locked cabinet within a locked
office. Transcripts were entered in a password-protected
computer and were not linked to participants' identity.
Aliases were used throughout the analysis and reporting
process.
Participants were recruited from southeast Michigan via
flyers posted at local language schools, high schools, and
colleges/universities, via an online posting, and by using
snowball sampling techniques. The majority of participants
(20 of 28) contacted us by email after seeing our flyers and/
or online posting. Eight participants were referred by word-
of-mouth (snowball sampling). During our 4-month recruit-
ment period, a total of 32 adolescents contacted us by email
or phone to express interest in the study. Four adolescents
were unable to finalize an interview date due to scheduling,
and eventually declined participation. Because of the time it
took to obtain parental consent, the 17-year-olds were the
4 SAGE Open
final group to complete interviews. Participants received a
US$30 incentive after interview completion.
Measures
Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview
guide (see Figure 1) and an EHC (see Figure 2). Participants
also completed a demographic sheet that assessed racial/eth-
nic background, years of U.S. residency, gender, age, family
income, and parents' marital status. The interview guide was
structured with the intent to assess and understand patterns of
parent­child interaction, with questions designed to explore
participant perceptions of parental expectations/attitudes
about their future and their health behaviors. To relate ado-
lescent perceptions to their actual health behaviors, we asked
participants to report their extracurricular activities, per-
ceived parental relationship, and sexual activities over the
previous 4 years. Participants reported these data via the
EHC, which was modeled after a calendar developed by
Martyn and Belli (2002). Using reflection and autobio-
graphic memory, the EHC allowed participants to recall
sexual activities (e.g., sexual debut, sexual partner/s, and
condom use), parental relationships, and perceived parental
attitudes over a 4-year period, beginning when they were 13
to 15 years of age. The interview guide and EHC were pre-
tested with three adolescents: two were Asian American and
one was White. Modifications to the interview guide and
EHC were made based on pretesting feedback to ensure that
language was appropriate for the identified age groups and
that the content had cultural relevance.
Interview Procedure
Gender-matched, face-to-face interviews were conducted
with each participant. Two digital audio recorders were used
to ensure accuracy of data collection. Research assistants
took field notes to record initial impressions and non-verbal
cues. Interviews lasted roughly 1 hr. Participants first com-
pleted the demographic sheet. Using the interview guide,
interviewers explored adolescents' parental relationships,
their perceived parental sexual attitudes, and their percep-
tions of what their parents want for them (Figure 1, Questions

in the room, but sat at a distance to allow participants pri-
vacy. Participants were encouraged to ask questions as
needed. They were reassured that the information they pro-
vided would be confidential and that aliases would be used
for their names or the names of anyone they mentioned in the
analysis or reporting process. During the final segment of the
interview, adolescents were asked to identify and explain
what they considered the most important recommendation
for parents with adolescents similar to themselves (Figure 1,
Question 5).
Data Analysis
To cancel out potential biases innate in any single qualitative
or quantitative research design (Bryman, 2006; Johnson,
Onwuegbuzie, & Turner, 2007), we used between-method tri-
angulation to integrate findings from our qualitative and
quantitative data sources (Creswell, 2007; Flick, 1992;
Thurmond, 2001). In addition, we used data triangulation to
capture a more complete and holistic interpretation of adoles-
cents' perceived parental expectations toward sexual behav-
iors (Sale, Lohfeld, & Brazil, 2002; Tobin & Begley, 2004).

Quantitative data. We extracted several EHC items (see Fig-
ure 1) to assess adolescents' perceived parental attitudes
toward sex, their relationship with their parents, and their
sexual activities over the prior 4 years. To assess adolescents'
perceptions of their relationships with their mothers, we
summarized reported maternal closeness (1 = distant, 4 =
very close) over the previous 4 years to represent their over-
all maternal relationships. Similar procedures were applied
to other EHC items to create variables representing adoles-
cents' perceived paternal relationships, perceived parental
sexual attitudes, and various sexual activities (abstinence sta-
tus, age of sexual onset, total sexual partners, and frequency
of condom use). To assess within-subject differences, we
obtained the mean of each variable for each group by year.
We then examined and compared 4-year trends between each
group and variable. In addition, bivariate correlations were
performed using SPSS 19 to determine relationships among
variables extracted from the EHCs (summed scores across 4
years). Two participants of mixed racial heritage (Asian and
White) self-identified as Asian American and were therefore
included in the Asian American group.
Qualitative data.Digital audio files were transcribed by a
trained research assistant and verified by a second research
assistant prior to analysis. We used inductive content analy-
sis (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008) and constant comparative analysis
(Kurasaki, 2000; Morse, Barrett, Mayan, Olson, & Spiers,
2002; Turner, 2010) to analyze the 28 interview transcripts
and field notes. Guided by symbolic interactionism (Blumer,
1969), analysis focused on understanding how adolescents
perceived the meaning of "parental expectations about sex"
through the description of daily interactions with their par-
ents, and how these expectations related to decisions about
sexual activity. We used concepts drawn from the expectancy
violation­realignment model (Collins & Luebker, 1994) to
guide our understanding about the meaning and process of
how adolescents perceived, violated, and realigned parental
expectations about sex via daily interactions with their
parents.
To create the codebook, three coders (i.e., the two research
assistants and the principal investigator) annotated the text,
sorted the annotation list, and labeled thematic categories. A
text sample was used to establish acceptable inter-coder reli-
ability for each codebook theme before conducting a com-
parative analysis. NVivo 10 software was used to facilitate
the coding process and data analysis (e.g., crossing referenc-
ing). Specifically, EHC information regarding sexual debut
and number of sexual partners was entered as attributes in
NVivo 10 to assess the relationship between emerging
themes and adolescents' self-reported sexual behaviors. A
sexually active adolescent was defined as an adolescent who
had had oral, anal, or vaginal sex. A non-sexually active ado-
lescent was defined as an adolescent who had no sexual
intercourse, although they may have reported kissing or
petting.
Results
This mixed-methods study used gender-matched, in-depth
interviews to explore how White and Asian American ado-
lescents perceive parental expectations via parent­child
interactions, and how such expectations relate to self-
reported sexual activities over time.
Quantitative Results
Compared with their White counterparts, Asian American
adolescents in our sample were more likely to report being
sexually abstinent (Levene's test, p = .002): 50% of Asian
American adolescents (n = 7) reported being sexually absti-
nent, versus 14% of White adolescents (n = 2). Among sexu-
ally active adolescents, the mean age of sexual initiation was
similar for both groups (AsianAmerican: 16.25 years; White:
16.18 years). Male adolescents were more likely to be sexu-
ally experienced (p = .033) and to have more sex partners
(p = .036). Of the 14 males, 11 (79%) reported being sexually
active, versus 6 of the 14 females (43%). The mean age of
sexual initiation was 16.5 years for females and 16 years for

males. Of the 19 adolescents who were sexually active, 4 had
more than four or more sexual partners (21%), 7 had two to
three partners (37%), and 8 had one sexual partner (42%).
Comparatively, the adolescents in our sample were less
likely than those in a recent, nationally representative sam-
ple, the 2011 national Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance
sample (CDC, 2012) to have used a condom during their last
sexual intercourse (52% vs. 60.2%).
Results of our correlational analysis indicated that sexual
abstinence, later sexual debut, and fewer sex partners were
closely related to adolescent perceptions of conservative,
disapproving parental attitudes (measured by the age or situ-
ation when parents might permit and/or expect sexual activ-
ity, and how upset adolescents thought their parents would be
if they had had sex at each age during the prior 4 years).
Table 2 presents bivariate correlations among extracted EHC
variables. Adolescent perceptions of conservative parental
attitudes and disapproving parental attitudes toward sex were
consistent (r = .577 and .748, p < .01, respectively). In addi-
tion, we examined patterns of association among these two
variables against adolescents' self-reported sexual activities
across the four time points. We noted that as the mean score
of disapproving and conservative parental attitudes
decreased, the mean score of reported sexual activities and
number of partners increased. In particular, there was an
obvious association between perceived maternal disapprov-
ing attitudes and the number of sex partners.
In terms of perceived parental relationships reported in
the EHC, there was no significant difference between Asian
and White American adolescents. There was no noticeable
trend in the relationship between perceived parental relation-
ships and reported sexual activities. In fact, closer maternal
relationships were associated with less disapproving parental
attitudes (mother, r = -.326; father, r = -.383) and being
sexually active (r = .344). Among adolescents who were
sexually active, those who perceived a closer maternal rela-
tionship reported later sexual onset (r = .418). Notably, dis-
approving and conservative parental attitudes were closely
related. Overall, our quantitative results show that adolescent
perceptions of conservative and disapproving parental atti-
tudes/expectations were protective against early sexual onset
and multiple sex partners (see Table 2).
Qualitative Results
Four themes emerged from our analysis relating to adoles-
cents' perceptions of their parents' perspectives and attitudes
toward sex. Specifically, this included how adolescents
learned about, interpreted, and responded to their parents'
expectations.
Theme 1: Expectations are culture-specific and value-laden.Per-
ceived parental sexual attitudes were closely associated with
families' cultural or religious beliefs. Concerns about disap-
pointing parents, for example, were significant for both
Asian American and White adolescents, although the cul-
tural/family values that shaped parental expectations were
different. Many Asian American adolescents reported paren-
tal expectations relevant to their parents' native culture. One
participant commented, "Being an Asian . . . there are more
expectations of you" (Anna, age 17, Asian American
female).1 Every year Anna and her parents traveled to Tai-
wan, her parents' native home, so that they could show her
the "Asian ways of doing things." Sexuality development
was not a priority for her parents. Rather, they expected her
to "practice violin . . . get straight A's . . . go to Chinese
school" and to avoid activities such as partying and dating.
Another participant stated,

There's definitely parental expectation [to not have a romantic
or sexual relationship]; you [the child] must be academically
successful so you can get a good job and provide for your family,
that's definitely a good thing . . . Society sees Asians as . . . we
all grow up to be accountants or engineers or doctors, like,
career, but it is not the true representation of Asian Americans.
(William, age 19, Asian American male)
This participant felt that the lack of accurate representa-
tion made it difficult for many Asian adolescents "to figure
out a sense of identity"--that is, to cultivate their social and
sexual development.
Parental expectations about sexual behavior were influ-
enced heavily by parents' views of culturally appropriate
gender roles. A majority of participants stated that their par-
ents would be more protective toward daughters, including
stricter curfews, more rules, and increased monitoring. One
participant described her father's gender expectations:
If my father got to choose the way I lived, I would never leave
the house past 6 o'clock, I would never wear shorts shorter than
my knees, I would never talk to a guy, I would never wear a two-
piece bathing suit. He's super conservative . . . But he is different
with my brothers. (Karen, age 17, Asian American female)
Some adolescents mentioned religious belief as an impor-
tant part of their families' values, and as an influence that
governed their relationships with their parents and their own
sexual attitudes/behaviors. Karen linked her family's reli-
gious affiliation to her self-identification, personality traits,
and sexual attitudes/behaviors: "Like my parents, I'm Hindu
. . . my religion has played a big role in pretty much every-
thing I do." Another participant also noted that her parents,
who were Hindu, had overall expectations that were guided
by their religion: "I guess they showed me more of the ben-
efits than the cons so it [Hinduism] just, it seemed the most,
like, right idea in my head and it's always just been that
way." She explained that her behaviors were related to "the
way my parents raised me." For example, she did not wear
shorts at home or in front of her father or brother. She
described her father's rules to be
"No drinking, no drugs, and no dating" [and] "Before you do
anything, be like, `What would [my religious mentor] do?'" . . .
[My father] was right, and I figure, three-fourths of the rules
work, I mean I've dated but I've never had alcohol, I've never
had a cigarette, you know those are just things that I'm willing
to give up for the sake of my heritage or my background. (Helen,
age 19, Asian American female)
Family religious beliefs and activities also played an
important role in how White adolescents perceived parental
sexual expectations. One participant described his parents'
attitudes as conservative, and specifically to not have sex
until marriage. He believed that this expectation derived from
the ethics and morals of his family's Baptist religion. These
beliefs influenced his perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors:
The first time I had sex it was so scary. I guess, it's because of
my dad's [Christian] views on it, and . . . at a subconscious level
I was disappointing my father even though it's not like he knew
it. He still doesn't know about it. But, definitely what your
parents think and tell you influences your actions whether you
realize it or not, they always do. (Paul, age 18, White male)
High parental expectations were taxing on some of the
adolescents. One participant felt guilty about not letting his
father know about his "last two sex partners" (Ben, age 19,
White male). He was unable to meet his parents' high expec-
tations of "no sex until marriage" and experienced role strain
because of "not wanting to let down my parents and . . . my
church background. It was kind of a whole guilt things . . .
sometimes keeping me up at night." Another participant dis-
cussed her reaction to her mother's high expectation of "no
sex until marriage":
I don't want her to think any less of me, I don't want her to know
everything about my relationships, but I do let her know that I'm
safe and, like, "What I'm doing hopefully you can trust me." . .
. It was so uncomfortable for me to talk to her because I was
always the goody-good child in the family, and she would
always say, "Oh, I always thought that you would wait until
marriage to have sex." Me, like, "Why do I have to have some
expectations?" . . . so that . . . kind of hit home. (Jennifer, age 18,
White female)
Cultural and religious background seemed to play an
important role in when and under what conditions adoles-
cents believed their parents would approve of them engag-
ing in sexual activity. Three subthemes emerged in regard
to parental expectations for sexual timing: abstinence until
college and/or age 18, abstinence until marriage, or accept-
able as long as the adolescent practiced safe sex (see Table
3). Asian American adolescents were more likely to
describe their parents' sexual attitudes as "conservative,"
with the expectation that their youth abstain from sex until
marriage. White adolescents were more likely to describe
parental attitudes about sexual timing as acceptable "absti-
nence until college" or "okay as long as they are being
safe."
Three parental concerns about adolescent sexual activities
emerged from the interviews (see Table 3). Many parents
warned that having sex would limit opportunities for future
success. Other adolescents reported that parents talked about
unwanted consequences--specifically, contracting STIs or
becoming pregnant--to steer them away from sexual
activities.
Theme 2:A trusting parent­child relationship is fundamental.A
close and trusting relationship factored significantly into
how adolescents perceived their parents' expectations. A
close, trusting, and supportive relationship influenced how
well adolescents respected their parents'cultural beliefs, val-
ues, and sexual expectations.
Kao and Martyn 9
I trust her. She's not my best friend, she's my mother. She looks
out for me on a level that a best friend cannot comprehend.
(Helen, age 19, Asian American female)
[My father and I] trusted each other a lot more [than my mother
and I]. He knew that I was smart and that I wasn't gonna get
myself into too much trouble. (Betty, age 19, White female)
I've had a girlfriend for the past 3 years . . . And, uh . . . [my
parents] would joke like, "Don't do anything stupid. If you get
her pregnant, you know, her parents will come kill us." . . . I
mean, actually, I really like how they went about, it to be honest.
`Cause there's a lot of trust. I guess the only risk part was if I was
going to do something that I would regret later. But, I assumed
that when they said "Don't do anything stupid," I knew what
that meant and maybe once or twice they mentioned the word
pregnant maybe, but it's pretty much given. (Chris, age 19,
Asian American male)
Adolescents also viewed a close and trusting parental
relationship as a way to enable them to learn how to handle
emotional needs in their sexuality development. One partici-
pant wished her parents would talk with her about how she
would "feel" in a sexual relationship. She described sex as a
form of "connection" and said that her decision to have sex
was related to her need to connect emotionally with a male
partner.
Being a female, we want to have that emotional connection way
more than guys, and so we're a little bit more desperate and then
once we find that someone we're a little bit more attached . . .
this is gonna be very improper, but that's the sucky part of being
a girl. (Jennifer, age 18, White female)
Similarly, one participant advised other parents to "make
sure that their adolescents are not emotionally torn too bad"
(Ben, age 19, White male). Another participant stated, "If
[parents] have an open and trusting relationship with your
kids from the start, your effect on them will be a lot stronger"
(Linda, age 19, White female). One 19-year-old Asian
American participant, who had been sexually active since
age 16, with three sexual partners, shared experiences relat-
ing to his sexuality development and observed that "I've
always been emotionally detached as a teenager growing up"
and that "having sexual relationships" seemed to be a way to
"connect" with others.
Theme 3:Parents convey expectations in different ways.Adoles-
cents learned about parents' sexual attitudes and expecta-
tions via direct and/or non-direct communication. White
adolescents tended to learn from their parents via conversa-
tion, while Asian American adolescents tended to learn from
their parents via non-verbal routes. White participants were
more likely to talk with their parents about personal or
Table 3. Subthemes of Parental Sexual Expectations: Timing and Consequences.
Timing Sample quotes
Abstinence until college and/or
age 18
At first she was like "I want you to wait until you're married" and then after a while she's
kinda like, "All right, that's unrealistic, but umm . . . " I know she'd want me to wait until I
was married, but she kinda knows that I'm going to college next year, it's probably going
to happen. (Linda, age 17, White female)
Abstinence until marriage My parent's attitude is wait until you're married . . . they just think that like wait until
you're married because if you end up with a kid and the guy leaves, then you have some
issues to deal with. (Carol, age 18, Asian American female)
Sex "okay" if being safe My father, he was straight up with me . . . "Are you having sex with your boyfriend?" and
I told him yeah, and he was like, "Well, are you being safe?" yeah, and then he's like,
"Well." (Grace, age 17, White female)
Consequences Sample quotes
Sex limits opportunities My parents have told me, like, "You know if you end up getting a girl pregnant then . . . you
not going to be going to college you're going to be, like . . . find a job and start working
there and be able to support that baby" . . . and so . . . (Ben, age 19, White male)
Concerns about STIs There was so much talk [between my parents and I] about getting diseases [STIs] . . . I was
just so scared thinking that he gave me a disease or something . . . that was the worst
part, thinking that he ruined my life. (Betty, age 19, White female)
Don't do anything that's, you know, risky and you might get . . . you know, STD. (George,
age 19, Asian American male)
Concerns about teen pregnancy I actually went and got myself on birth control when I was 15, before I ever done anything
because I wanted to be safe in case. I didn't wanna end up pregnant. (Betty, age 19, White
female)
You know that's always . . . the condom can break and stuff [pregnancy] like that, umm, I
wasn't worried about like STD's . . ., I knew that wasn't a problem. (Paul, age 18, White
male)
Note. STI = sexually transmitted infection; STD = sexually transmitted disease.

relational problems and feelings with their parents, and were
more likely to request open communication with their par-
ents. Open parent­child communication was essential for
their ability to establish a trusting relationship with their
parents:
[My mother] asked me about my boyfriend, and if I got a new
boyfriend she's, like, "Are you guys having sex?" It's a pretty
straightforward answer, "Yeah." (Grace, age 17, White
female)
[Parents should have an] open relationship, like being able to
talk, not the awkward kind of, like, "All right here's a book
[about sex], read it, we'll talk if you have any questions," but,
like, to be able to relate and say, like, "I've been in your situation
before, I kinda know what you're going through, and it's
importantformetobeinvolved[inyoursexualitydevelopment],"
like, I think it's really important that you, to have that really
special bond between, like, a parent and child. (Linda, age 17,
White female)
I've always been really close with my mom and I've never been
afraid to talk to her about anything, so I've always valued my
relationship with my mom . . . She never tried to hide the fact
that she was eighteen when she had my sister. And you know she
told me about, you know it was, like, her first time and . . . it was
a mistake and then she got pregnant the very first time it
happened and she never she never laid sex out to me as like it
was, umm, like, a really bad thing. She just kinda wanted me to
be careful, to be really careful . . . Yeah, being open is for sure is
the most important, but . . . I mean you wanna make sure you
disciplining them, but you don't, you also don't wanna make
them feel like they're a bad person for doing anything. (Paul,
age 18, White male)
Conversely, language could be a barrier to parental com-
munication. Some preferred observation:
I wouldn't say that we're, like, very close because there was,
like, sort of, like, a small language barrier, because I learned
English here and I grew up speaking English, whereas my mom
doesn't know any English, but, like, I can still speak Chinese,
it's just not as well as I can speak English, I'm not, like, fluent,
but I'll still be able to talk to her, but I didn't, I never talked to
her about, like, my problems or, like, what's really going on in
my life [i.e., dating or a having sexual relationship] . . . I think
parents should teach [how to avoid risk] by example. (Nancy,
age 18, Asian American female)
Many Asian American adolescents learned about par-
ents' sexual expectations via non-verbal communication,
such as observing their actions and behaviors. Many noted
difficulties in opening up to their parents, particularly
because sex is a taboo topic in many Asian cultures. One
participant speculated that his parents did not have the "sex
talk" because they viewed him as a child, whereas another
interpreted their avoidance of sexual topics as an attempt to
keep him focused on the merits of hard work and
achievement:
I feel like it's because they're, they're just, like, shy away from
the subject and they don't want to . . . they're not ready yet to
accept that, that I'm like, like, grown enough for it, you know, I
feel like they still look at me as a child, so they feel like they
shouldn't talk about that issue, then I will eventually figure it out
by myself. (Ralph, age 19, Asian American male)
As vigilance, my mother and father . . . they have a restaurant
and they work . . . they always worked hard a lot. So, they
always . . . you know, they want me to have a better life so . . .
and they always help me, the key to that, you know, have a good
. . . education, uh, career . . . so they always . . . tell me to uh, do
my best. (George, age 19, Asian American male)
Overall, the Asian American adolescents seemed to
understand their parents' reluctance to engage in "sex talk."
One participant stated, "I understand why my parents are
both a little standoffish about the topic . . . they are not com-
fortable" (Donna, age 18, Asian American female). Another
rationalized that avoidance was the only approach that Asian
parents were familiar with: "Asian parents are just doing
things that they are good [emphasis added] at [i.e., avoiding
topics or situations]," including not allowing romantic or
sexual relationships (Carol, age 19, Asian American female).
Some Asian adolescents mentioned that excessive paren-
tal emphasis on academic success made them feel that their
parents' care for them was "conditional." This was different
from that of their White counterparts, who were more likely
to report their parents' care as unconditional--that is, to ulti-
mately desire their children to be happy.
Adolescents were very observant of their parents' behav-
ior. When there was a difference between what parents said
and did, adolescents tended to ignore parental expectations
and aligned with their own beliefs instead:
[My father is] kind of a hypocrite . . . it's kind of off-topic, but
he smoked. I've been caught smoking . . . he's just really, really
judgmental with a lot of things [about my boyfriend] though.
He's hard on me a lot of the time. (Grace, age 17, White female)
Overall, parental expectations played a significant role in
adolescents' decisions about engaging in sexual activities
that might jeopardize their future success. One participant
recalled that her mother told her, "You know, you have so
much to live for. Why ruin it now to have a baby [or sex] so
young?" (Jennifer, age 18, White female). Another stated,
I'm pretty much American, since I've lived here my whole life,
and I guess my parents, they've had different rules than other
parents. That's one main thing I've noticed, like, through high
school I would have a curfew. They were kinda more strict about
the grades. Maybe for my whole upbringing they've had a
higher emphasis on grades and so [abstinence has] been good for
me, I guess. (Steve, age 19, Asian American male)
Generally, if adolescents felt that their parents' expecta-
tions were acceptable, they were more likely to take them
into consideration when making decisions about engaging in
Kao and Martyn 11
sexual activities. Some participants agreed with or thought
that their parents' attitudes were realistic.
I am not [sexually active] . . . I think [my parents] influenced me
by having that sort of [conservative] attitude towards sexual
relationships. (Carol, age 18, Asian American female)
My parents do not want me to have sex right now . . . I thought
that it was really good that my parents were attentive to who I
was hanging out with or what I'm doing . . . this is different from
some of my friends' parents. (Lisa, age 17, White female)
While there was a consensus among adolescents that "sex
takes away opportunities," female adolescents were more
likely to mention parental concerns about STIs and early
pregnancy. Male adolescents were less likely to have had
such conversations with their parents.
Theme 4: Parenting practices matter.Parenting styles and
practices influenced how adolescents viewed parental expec-
tations. The majority of adolescents disliked it when their
parents preached or lectured, but they responded well when
their parents shared personal experiences with them, and
they felt closer to them after listening to their stories:
Even though my [mother] made mistakes about having kids at
an early age, she made sure that we knew to value . . . self-worth.
(Jennifer, age 18, White female)
One time I was, umm, going on a date with a guy that was a few
years older than me and [my father] kinda, like, warned me
about he thinks guys are only thinking about one thing . . . he
knows that when how he was when he was, you know, 20 or 21
years old, so he was just telling me, like, "watch out" so I guess
to me that made me think . . . how his experience is affecting
how he sees mine . . . well, for like a father and a daughter,
specifically . . . just you know kinda giving the guys perspective
of the whole thing, so that [the daughter] understands that better.
(Sandra, age 18, White female)
Other positive parenting practices included knowing an
adolescent's whereabouts, being involved in an adolescent's
decision making, and having same-gender, parent­child
dyadic sexual discussion. Negative practices included being
"overprotective" and "controlling." Asian adolescents, in
particular, were more likely to describe parenting styles as
"controlling" and "strict," in which parents paid the majority
of attention to their children's whereabouts and academic
achievement. White participants rarely mentioned parental
monitoring activities.
Participants made both positive and negative comments
about "strict" parenting styles. For one adolescent, her
father's strict parenting style discouraged independent deci-
sion making:
I obviously don't have as open of a relationship [with my father]
as I do with my mom . . . he's much more strict, he's extremely
like . . . very strict. "If I say you're coming home at 12, you're
coming home at 12," and there's no negotiation about that, like
things are his way or I don't get anything. (Linda, age 17, Asian
American female)
Conversely, another participant interpreted parental strict-
ness as a way to protect her from making mistakes and to
ensure future success:
I have to be really careful about balance [between what I want
and what my parents want] . . . I can't screw up . . . that's why I
was pressured to be pre-med. Or, like at least go into health . . .
it's because medicine is almost a guaranteed $100K+ career. My
parents both know what it's like to grow up with nothing. (Helen,
age 19, Asian American female)
Some adolescents urged parents to have "realistic" expec-
tations, while others advised parents to love and support their
adolescents unconditionally.
Don't have unrealistic views, make sure that your child knows
that they can come to you with anything. It's important for you
to be there and support them. (Jennifer, age 18, White female)
Give [adolescents] a lot of love every day, show them a lot of
attention. (Ben, age 19, White male)
Other participants echoed the importance of spending
quality time together to support and improve the parent­
child relationship in general, thereby making it easier for
parents to talk about important topics such as sexual activi-
ties or behavior.
If [parents] ignore it, it's gonna be more of a problem. That's
why so many kids are pregnant these days or because the parents
don't wanna talk about it. They think if they just ignore it, it's
not gonna be a problem, well that's not true. Just like if your kid
was doing drugs, you'd wanna talk to them, you wouldn't just
ignore it. (Betty, age 19, White female)
I've been good at holding off peer pressure, but peer pressure
can be very strong so I think parents definitely need to bring it
up more, no matter how awkward it is, I know we [Asians] don't
wanna talk about it, but peer pressure's getting worse and worse
and if your all your friends starting doing it, it becomes, like, ok
to start doing it, so [Asian parents] definitely need to talk about
it. (Karen, age 17, Asian American female)
In summary, our qualitative analysis revealed that adoles-
cents' decisions about sex were associated with their percep-
tions of parental sexual attitudes, expectations, and
relationships. Adolescents appeared to experience repeated
cycles of expectation violation and realignment, and eventu-
ally developed an understanding of their parents' sexual
expectations. In particular, we noted behavioral realignment
in the actions of adolescents who considered the conse-
quences of engaging in sexual activity when they felt that
such behavior would disappoint their parents or violate their
trust and expectations. Although this consideration may not
12 SAGE Open
have completely deterred these adolescents from sexual
activity, they appeared to have been more likely to attempt to
minimize risks or consequences associated with sexual activ-
ity, such as using birth control pills or condoms. Ultimately,
they did not want to become a teenage parent or to contract
STIs, which they believed would "take away future
opportunities."
Discussion
This study explored how adolescents perceive and frame
their parents' sexual expectations. Specifically, we examined
how perceived parental expectations relate to the parent­
child relationship and adolescents' reported sexual activities
over time. Four important themes about adolescent percep-
tions of parental expectations were derived from our analy-
sis: (a) expectations are culture-specific and value-laden, (b)
a trusting parent­adolescent relationship is fundamental, (c)
parents convey expectations in different ways, and (d) par-
enting practices matter.
Congruent with the expectancy violation­realignment
model (Collins & Luebker, 1994), adolescents'sexual activi-
ties were associated with their perceptions of parental sexual
expectations, and were the result of dyadic parent­child
interactions. Our results indicate that adolescents' perceived
parental attitudes (or expectations) demarcated what behav-
iors were acceptable or unacceptable. In particular, our quali-
tative results indicate that if an adolescent was to mind his or
her parents' expectations, it was important for the adolescent
to have a trusting and supportive parental relationship. Our
qualitative and quantitative results also illustrate that disap-
proving and conservative parental attitudes are protective
against adolescent risky sexual behaviors. This is congruent
with other research findings (Dittus & Jaccard, 2000;
O'Donnell et al., 2008; Weber-Shifrin, 2003), and suggests
that promoting an adolescent's perceived parental expecta-
tions may be effective for preventing risky sexual behavior.
We also note that the Asian American adolescents in our
sample observed that their parents practiced the distinct par-
enting practice/style of focusing on and expecting a signifi-
cant degree of academic success. Adolescents warned that
this excessive attention might be misinterpreted as "condi-
tional" love, resulting in a misperception that could strain the
parent­child relationship. This could be problematic for ado-
lescents who fail to meet their parents'high expectations and
experience psychological stress. Hwang and Wood (2009)
have suggested that distant parent­child relationships may
be related to symptoms and risks for clinical depression
amongAsianAmerican adolescents. Thus, it might be impor-
tant for health professionals to seek ways to strengthen the
parent­child relationship. In such cases, adolescents may
feel accepted and more willing to share personal problems
with their parents.
Reported parental closeness, as indicated by the EHC
data, was similar between White and Asian American adoles-
cents. Our interview data demonstrate that White adolescents
were less likely to report parental regulation or monitoring of
their activities or whereabouts. It is not clear if the compara-
tively higher rate of sexual activity reported by White ado-
lescents is related to their reports of less parental monitoring.
However, it is important to note that parental monitoring has
a protective effect against adolescent risky sexual behaviors
(Wagner et al., 2010). We also observed that as adolescents
grew older, their perceptions of disapproving parental sexual
attitudes decreased while sexual activities increased. This
pattern of association was most obvious among White ado-
lescents. Overall, it seems that sexual activities were closely
related to how adolescents perceived parental attitudes over
time.
Enhancing positive parenting practices can strengthen the
parent­adolescent relationship, particularly when the prac-
tices work to build an adolescent's sense of parental trust and
closeness. Our results indicate that adolescents tended to
trust and perceive a closer relationship with their parents if
parental demands and expectations were clearly explained
and/or were perceived as realistic. Adolescents who per-
ceived parental expectations to be realistic and valuable were
more likely to commit to their cultural/familial values and
behave accordingly. Helping parents realize their cultural/
familial strengths and to shape or reframe them into realistic
expectations may be a good way to promote family strengths
and maximize parental influences in the positive develop-
ment of healthy adolescent behaviors.
Consistency between what parents said and how they
behaved was an important factor for adolescents in determin-
ing how much they would "mind," or follow, their parents'
expectations. In general, adolescents disliked when parents
"preached" or lectured, but they were very interested in
learning about their parents' experiences and perspectives.
Having a parent share personal stories was a great way for
adolescents to understand their parents' perspectives, values,
and beliefs. Consistent parental attitudes and modeling
behaviors merged as critical to adolescents' decision making
about what behaviors were appropriate and acceptable.
Adolescents were more likely to honor parental expectations
about appropriate or safe behaviors if they understood and
accepted the rationale behind such expectations.
Although adolescents in this study "requested" autonomy
or independence from their parents, their recommendations
for parents of adolescents similar to themselves included
being "close" with their adolescents and being "watchful" of
peer influences. Health care providers should be aware of the
importance of guiding and assisting parents to build a trust-
ing, close relationship with their children, and of establishing
clear and realistic expectations.
While the Asian American adolescents in this study were
less likely to report being sexually active and more likely to
respect their parents' expectations to remain abstinent, they
were more likely to report difficulty communicating with
their parents and to wish for greater autonomy. In this study,
we observed that the sexual activities reported by these
seemingly "problem-free" adolescents were not as risk-free
Kao and Martyn 13
as previously thought. Participant reports of multiple sex
partners and/or engaging in unprotected sexual activities
were higher than those reported in a recent, nationally repre-
sentative survey of adolescent health-risk behaviors (CDC,
2012). Due to our small sample size, it is not sufficient to
suggest Asian American and White adolescents as at-risk
groups, but it does suggest that stereotyping them as "prob-
lem-free" may be unhelpful for promoting their sexual health
development.
Limitations
This study was limited by our sample distribution, particu-
larly as many participants were from middle- to high-income
families and had parents who held a college degree. This
could partly explain participants' higher-than-normal aspira-
tions for success, as well as their relatively later sexual onset.
However, it is important to note that there is no empirical
evidence to suggest that adolescents from highly educated,
high-income homes engage in sexual activities at lower rates.
Our sample was also limited to one geographical area, and
the use of snowball sample techniques tended to draw other
participants of similar backgrounds and/or socioeconomic
status. Asian Americans are a heterogeneous group with
many different cultural beliefs, and results should be inter-
preted with caution. A larger and more diverse sample could
provide deeper insight into adolescent perceptions of paren-
tal expectations across socioeconomic and cultural back-
grounds. Given the size and make-up of the sample, the
knowledge produced may not be generalizable to other indi-
viduals or settings. Finally, face-to-face interviews provide
opportunities for synchronous communication and observa-
tion, but the researcher's presence can affect participant
responses. Robust procedures were applied during data anal-
ysis, but potential researcher bias and idiosyncrasies embed-
ded in the qualitative design could exist.
Implications
Despite the limitations of our sample, our findings have
important theoretical implications for understanding and
operationalizing the concept of perceived parental expecta-
tions. Knowing how White and Asian American adolescents
perceive parental expectations about sex and how such
expectations might be related to their sexual behaviors can
help practitioners develop strategies to facilitate parent­child
interactions. In addition, a thorough understanding about the
effect of perceived parental expectations can be very useful
in the effort to improve parent­child interactions. For exam-
ple, an in-depth understanding of how adolescents perceive
parental expectations may enhance the development of mea-
sures based on expectancy theory (Smith & Goldman, 1994),
allowing practitioners to target factors that are significant in
shaping adolescents' perceived parental expectations. This
knowledge can be used to tailor family strategies to improve
parent­child interactions. Subsequently, such tailored family
interventions would be more effective in enhancing parent
and adolescent efficacy for healthy behaviors.
Overall, our study demonstrates that the concept of per-
ceived parental expectations can be used to help practitioners
understand how adolescents perceive and respond to parental
sexual expectations. The parent­child relationship and
parental attitudes play an important role in fostering such
expectations. Thus, family practitioners can utilize this con-
cept to enhance parent­child interactions and minimize ado-
lescent risky behaviors. Further research is needed to develop
an expectancy-focused family intervention to improve par-
ent­adolescent interactions and thereby prevent risky
behaviors.
