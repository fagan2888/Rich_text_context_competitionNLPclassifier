Introduction
Angiotensin (Ang) II is a pleiotropic peptide that impacts
the function of varied cells leading to the regulation of many
organ systems. Centrally produced Ang II is well character-
ized for its ability to modulate blood pressure and cardiac
hypertrophy by regulating sympathetic nerve activity, vaso-
pressin release and fluid intake.1,2 The diverse actions of
Ang II are mediated by its interactions with Ang AT1
and
AT2
receptors, which are coupled to many signaling mole-
cules, including small G proteins, phospholipases, mitogen-
activated protein (MAP) kinases, phosphatases, tyrosine
kinases, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) oxidase, and transcription factors.3­5 Recently,
the heptapeptide Ang III, which is also known as Ang 2-8,
has received attention due to similarities in its physiological
and pathological actions as compared to Ang II.6 Indeed,
Ang III also couples with the Ang AT1
and AT2
receptors
and binds with similar affinity as Ang II to these receptors
and can activate these receptors with similar efficacy.2,7 Like
Ang II, most of the physiological and pathological effects of
the peptide are mediated by its interaction with the AT1
receptor with fewer actions mediated via the AT2
receptor.6
As examples, Ang III induced protein and DNA synthe-
sis as well as collagen synthesis and secretion in a concen-
tration-dependent manner in neonatal cardiac fibroblasts.8
Ang III via interaction with AT2
receptors induced aldos-
terone secretion from adrenal glomerulosa.9 In the central

Abstract
Introduction: Recently we established that pro-inflammatory actions of angiotensin (Ang) II in astrocytes involved Janus
kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and interleukin-6 (IL-6).
Materials and methods: In our current study, we determined in brainstem and cerebellum whether Ang III also
activates STAT3 leading to IL-6 mRNA expression and astrocyte proliferation.
Results: Ang III induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Significant STAT3
phosphorylation was rapid and was maximal within 10 min, and with 100 nM Ang III. The Ang AT1
receptor was shown
to mediate this action of Ang III. Ang III also significantly induced IL-6 mRNA expression within an hour, and maximal Ang
III-mediated IL-6 mRNA expression occurred in the presence of 100 nM Ang III. Ang III-mediated IL-6 mRNA expression
occurred by the interaction of the peptide with the Ang AT1
receptor and was mediated by STAT3. In addition, STAT3
was shown to mediate Ang III astrocyte proliferation.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that Ang III, similar to Ang II, has pro-inflammatory effects since it induces STAT3
leading to an induction of IL-6 mRNA expression, outcomes that lend relevance to the physiological importance of
central Ang III.

nervous system (CNS), Ang III is shown to be physiologi-
cally important causing arginine vasopressin (AVP) release
and blood pressure increases, similar to Ang II after intrac-
erebroventricular injection of the peptides.10­12
Other studies focused on the effects of Ang III on neu-
rons in vivo and showed that the peptide is much more
potent than Ang II in inducing responses from paraven-
tricular nucleus receptors from both normal and hyperten-
sive rats.13 We have recently shown that Ang III interacts
with Ang AT1
receptors to activate the extracellular sig-
nal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and the c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) MAP kinase pathways leading to astrocyte
proliferation.14,15 The actions of Ang III to induce these
MAP kinase pathways were very similar to those of Ang
II suggesting that this peptide has equipotent potential as
compared to Ang II. Huang et al., in a recent study in
2013, showed that inhibition of brain Ang III attenuated
sympathetic hyperactivity and cardiac dysfunction in a
myocardial infarction model.16 Thus, these studies and
others have established Ang III as a physiologically rele-
vant peptide with a pivotal role in regulating blood
pressure.1
We have determined the pro-inflammatory potential of
Ang II in astrocytes by studying its ability to induce the
inflammatory mediator interleukin-6 (IL-6).17,18 IL-6 is a
pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine19 whose expres-
sion in plasma is elevated through activation of the Janus
kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription
(JAK/STAT) pathway.19 JAK/STAT is one of several path-
ways that translate signals from cell membranes to the
nucleus in response to many growth factors and cytokines.
Studies have shown that JAK2 activates STAT3 in the
presence of Ang II and induces various cell responses and
releases many cytokines including IL-6.17,18,20,21 Our find-
ings in astrocytes demonstrated that Ang II interacts with
AT1
receptors to induce IL-6 production; the JAK2/STAT3
pathway was shown to mediate this action of Ang II.17,18
The ability of Ang III to induce the STAT pathway lead-
ing to IL-6 gene expression is unknown in our system.
However, it has been recently reported that Ang III also
has pro-inflammatory properties. In rat mesangial and
mononuclear cells, Ang III induced the transcription fac-
tors nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
B cells (NF-B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), and
increased the expression of related genes, such as mono-
cyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).22 Thus, the focus
of the present study was to use cultured rat brainstem and
cerebellum astrocytes as model systems to determine
whether Ang III induced STAT3 phosphorylation leading
to an effect on the gene expression of IL-6. We chose to
study STAT3 because this early response gene is well
known to mediate pro-inflammatory effects and growth
promoting effects of Ang II.18,23,24 In addition, astrocytes
from brainstem and cerebellum will be investigated
because we and others have established that these brain
regions have well defined renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
components.25­27
Materials and methods
Materials
Tissue culture supplies such as Dulbecco's modified Eagles
Medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1), fetal bovine serum (FBS), anti-
biotic solution, and trypsin/ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
(EDTA), were purchased from VWR (Grand Island, New
York, USA) or Fisher Scientific (Milford, Massachusetts,
USA). Ang III was obtained from Bachem (Torrance,
California, USA). Losartan was a kind gift from Du Pont-
Merck (Wilmington, Delaware, USA) while PD123319 was

Stattic, the STAT3 inhibitor, was purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). 3H-thymidine (2000 Ci/
mmole) was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Solon, Ohio,
USA). The phospho-STAT3 antibody and the STAT3 anti-
body were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, Massachusetts, USA). Protein measurement sup-
plies, gel electrophoresis and western blotting supplies
including bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein reagents, acryla-
mide, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reagents, and nitro-
cellulose membrane were purchased from either VWR
(Piscataway, New Jersey, USA) or Biorad Laboratories
(Hercules, California, USA). Supplies to measure IL-6 gene
expression such as master mix, probes, cDNA kit and others
were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City,
California, USA) or Life Technology (Carlsbad, California,

Preparation of astrocytes
Timed, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from
Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Massachusetts,
USA) and maintained in theAssociation forAssessment and
Accreditation of LaboratoryAnimal Care (ALAAC) accred-
ited animal facility of Nova Southeastern University.
Primary cultures of astrocytes were prepared from the brain-
stem and cerebellum of 2­3 days old neonatal pups by phys-
ical dissociation as previously described.25­27 Cells were
maintained in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS, 100 g/ml peni-
cillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a humidi-
fied CO2
incubator (5% CO2
and 95% air). Cultures were
fed every 3­4 days until confluent. Confluent monolayers
were placed in DMEM/F12 containing 10 mM HEPES, pH
7.5, 10% FBS and antibiotics and shaken overnight to
remove oligodendrocytes and microglia. This method yields
an astroglial enriched culture system. Astrocytes were
detached with trypsin/EDTA (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM
EDTA), replated at a ratio of 1:10, and grown to about 85%
760 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
confluence prior to use. Isolated cells showed a positive
immunoreactivity with an antibody against glial fibrillary
acidic protein and negative immunoreactivity with markers
for neurons, fibroblasts or oligodendrocytes.
Western blot analysis
Cultured brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes were made
quiescent by a 48 h treatment with serum-free media. Cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of Ang III (0.1
nM to 1 µM) or with 100 nMAng III for 1­30 min. In other
experiments, brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes were
treated for 10 min with 100 nM Ang III in the presence and
absence of the STAT3 inhibitor (5 µM Stattic) or the AT1
receptor inhibitor (10 µM losartan) or the AT2
receptor
blocker (10 µM PD123319). Cells were also treated with
the inhibitors alone. Basal and stimulated levels of the pro-
teins were determined in the presence of dimethyl sulfox-
ide (DMSO) in experiments involving Stattic. Immediately
following treatments, cell lysates were prepared by wash-
ing cells with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01
mM NaVO4
followed by solubilization in supplemented
lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 1%
Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01 mM NaVO4
, 0.1 mM
PMSF and 0.6 M leupeptin, pH 7.4). The supernatant was
clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min, 4ºC)
and the protein concentration was measured based on the
BCA method according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Illinois, USA).
Proteins previously solubilized in lysis buffer were sep-
arated in 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitro-
cellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding to the
membranes was blocked by incubation with 5% Blotto
(5% evaporated milk, 1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered
saline). Subsequently, membranes were sequentially
probed with phospho-STAT3 antibody followed by the
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody as previously
described.17,18 The immunoreactive bands were visualized
using ECL reagents and the data quantified by densitome-
try. The non-phosphorylated form of STAT3 was used to
visualize protein loading as described.17,18
Measurement of DNA synthesis
Subconfluent monolayers of astrocytes growing in 24-well
culture dishes were made quiescent by 48 h treatment with
serum-free media. Individual wells were then pretreated
for 15 min with 5 µM Stattic, a selective inhibitor of
STAT3. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 100 nM
Ang III for 48 h. For comparative purposes, some wells
did not receive any peptides or were treated with DMSO
(the vehicle for Stattic) or were only treated with the inhib-
itor alone. 3H-thymidine (0.25 Ci/ml culture medium) was
added during the last 24 h of treatment. Newly synthesized
DNA was precipitated with 5% TCA, dissolved in 0.25 N
NaOH, and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry
as previously described.28
IL-6 mRNA expression
Quiescent astrocytes were treated with Ang III ranging in
concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1 µM or with 100 nM Ang
III for 30 min to 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from astro-
cytes using Tri reagent (Life Technology, Carlsbad,
California, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. DNA-free kit was used to eliminate any fractional
genomic DNA contamination in the RNA. Total RNA con-
centrations and purity were determined using a Biorad
SmartSpecTM spectrophotometer. Two micrograms of
total RNA from each sample were reverse-transcribed into
the complementary strand DNA using a high capacity
reverse transcription reagent kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, California, USA).
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was
performed using TaqMan Universal master mix, and the
Taq Man gene expression assay for rat IL-6 all supplied by
Applied Biosystems (Foster City, California, USA).
Samples were assayed in triplicates in 96 well plates using
the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR Systems from Applied
Biosystems. The widely accepted comparative Ct (thresh-
old cycle) method was used to perform relative quantifica-
tion of qPCR results.29 An arithmetic formula (fold
difference = 2-Ct) was used to calculate the relative
IL-6 mRNA expression in Ang III-stimulated astrocyte
cultures as compared to the unstimulated controls, after
normalization to levels of the housekeeping control gene,
beta-actin. Data are thus expressed as fold change in IL-6
mRNA expression as compared to basal IL-6 mRNA
expression in unstimulated cells.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the mean±standard error of the
mean (SEM) of six or more experiments, as indicated.
T-tests or repeated measures of one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's post-test were used to com-
pare treatment groups with groups treated with no
chemicals or those treated with the inhibitors, using
PRISM (GraphPad). The criterion for statistical signifi-
cance was set at p<0.05.
Results
STAT3 activation by Ang III
In previous studies we showed that Ang II rapidly induces
STAT3 phosphorylation in brainstem and cerebellar astro-
cytes.17,18 To determine whether Ang III also activated
STAT3 in cultured astrocytes from neonatal rat cerebellum
and brainstem astrocytes, cells were incubated with Ang III
Kandalam et al. 761
ranging in concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1 µM. Ang III
increased the phosphorylation of STAT3 protein in a con-
centration-dependent manner (Figure 1). Maximal phos-
phorylation was observed with 100 nMAng III in astrocytes
cultured from the brainstem (3.0±0.46 fold over basal,
Figure 1(a)). Similarly, in astrocytes isolated from the cer-
ebellum, maximal effects were observed with 100 nM Ang
III (2.4±0.41 fold over basal, Figure 1(b)). Ang III also
stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in both brainstem and
cerebellar astrocytes in a time-dependent manner (Figure
2). In both brainstem (Figure 2(a)) and cerebellum (Figure
2(b)) astrocytes, significant phosphorylation occurred as
early as 1 min, with maximal effects observed by 10 min
(Figure 2) suggesting that this Ang III effect was rapid and
sustained. Comparison of effects in brainstem versus cere-
bellum astrocytes showed no significant differences in the
abilities of cells from these two regions to respond to the
peptide. Our findings suggest that brainstem and cerebel-
lum astrocytes cultured under the same conditions do not
differ in their responses to Ang III in terms of potency and
time course of induction (See Figures 1 and 2).
To determine the specificity in this Ang III effect, qui-
escent astrocytes were also pretreated for 15 min with the
STAT3 inhibitor Stattic (5 µM), and then stimulated with
100 nMAng III for 10 min. Pretreatment of astrocytes with
Stattic attenuated Ang III-induced STAT3 phosphorylation
by ~80% (brainstem) and 100% (cerebellum) suggesting
that this was a direct and select effect of Ang III to activate
STAT3 (Table 1).
Effects of losartan and PD123319 on Ang III-
induced STAT3 phosphorylation
The Ang receptor involved in this effect was determined
by treating quiescent brainstem and cerebellar astrocytes
with 100 nM Ang III in the presence and absence of the
selective AT1
receptor antagonist (losartan, 10 µM) or the
selective AT2
receptor antagonist (PD123319, 10 µM).
Losartan attenuated by more than 80% and 90% Ang III-
induced STAT3 phosphorylation in brainstem and cerebel-
lum astrocytes, respectively (Table 1). The AT2
receptor
antagonist was ineffective (Table 1). These findings sug-
gest that Ang III interacts with the Ang AT1
receptor to
activate STAT3 in these cells.
Effects of Stattic on Ang III-induced astrocyte
DNA synthesis
Previous studies showed that Ang III significantly induced
astrocyte DNA synthesis.14 To determine whether Ang III-
induced astrocyte growth involved STAT3, quiescent brain-
stem and cerebellum astrocytes were pretreated with 5 µM

protein phosphorylation. Quiescent monolayers of brainstem (1(a)) or cerebellum (1(b)) astrocytes were incubated for 10 min
with Ang III ranging in concentration from 0.1 nM to 1 µM. STAT3 protein phosphorylation was measured by Western blot analysis
using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of STAT3. Protein loading was visualized using a non-phosphorylated
STAT3 antibody. The data were analyzed by densitometry and the amount of phosphorylation was calculated as the fold-increase
over basal in the presence of vehicle after normalization with values obtained with the STAT3 antibody. Each value represents the
mean± standard error of the mean (SEM) of preparations of brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes isolated from 6 or more litters
of neonatal rat pups. *denotes p<0.05 as compared to basal levels for STAT3 phosphorylation in astrocytes prepared from the

Stattic (STAT3 inhibitor) followed by 100 nM Ang III for
48 h. 3H-thymidine was added during the last 24 h of treat-
ment to measure astrocyte DNA synthesis, as an index of
growth. The results showed that Ang III significantly stim-
ulated brainstem and cerebellum astrocyte growth to a
similar extent as we have previously observed (Table 2).
We also observed that pretreatment of quiescent astrocytes
with 5 µM Stattic completely prevented Ang III-mediated
astrocyte growth in both brainstem and cerebellum astro-
cytes (Table 2). These findings suggest that Ang III acti-
vates STAT3 to induced astrocyte DNA synthesis, a
measure of growth.
Effects of Ang III on IL-6 mRNA expression
To investigate whether Ang III stimulated IL-6 mRNA
expression, astrocytes were stimulated for 45 min with
concentrations of Ang III ranging from 0.1 nM to 1 µM
with 10-fold increments in each concentration. As shown
in Figure 3, Ang III induced IL-6 mRNA expression in a
concentration-dependent manner. Maximal effects were
observed with 100 nM Ang III (2.0± 0.09 fold over basal
in brainstem astrocytes, and 1.9 ±0.3 fold over basal in
cerebellum astrocytes). These findings suggest that the
peptide had a similar potency in brainstem and cerebellum
astrocytes to induce IL-6 mRNA expression.
The time course of Ang III-mediated IL-6 mRNA
expression was also investigated over a time period rang-
ing from 30 min to 24 h. As shown in Figure 4, Ang III
enhanced the expression of IL-6 mRNAin a time-dependent
manner. In brainstem astrocytes (Figure 4(a)), there was a

phosphorylation. Quiescent brainstem (2(a)) or cerebellar (2(b)) astrocytes were incubated with 100 nM Ang III for 1 min to 30
min. STAT3 protein phosphorylation was measured by Western analysis using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of
STAT3. Protein loading was visualized using a non-phosphorylated STAT3 antibody. The data were analyzed by densitometry and
the amount of stimulation was calculated as the fold-increase over basal in the presence of vehicle after normalization with values
obtained with the STAT3 antibody. Each value represents the mean±standard error of the mean (SEM) of preparations of brainstem
or cerebellum astrocytes isolated from six or more litters of neonatal rat pups. *denotes p<0.05 as compared to basal levels for

gradual increase in IL-6 mRNA expression with signifi-
cant increases at all-time points up to 6 h. Maximal mRNA
expression occurred after 3 h of treatment with 100 nM
Ang III (1.7±0.2 fold over basal). Similarly in cerebellar
astrocytes (Figure 4(b)), there was significant upregula-
tion in IL-6 mRNA expression as early as 30 min and up
to 3 h. The maximal Ang III-induced expression of IL-6
mRNA was 2.6±0.5 over basal observed at the 3 h time
point, with effects tapering off thereafter. 100 nM Ang III
treatments did not induce IL-6 mRNA expression after 24
h of treatment in both brainstem and cerebellum astro-
cytes (Figure 4).
Effects of Stattic, losartan and PD123319 on
Ang III-mediated IL-6 mRNA induction
To investigate whether STAT3 mediates Ang III-induced
IL-6 mRNA expression, quiescent brainstem and cerebel-
lar astrocytes were pretreated for 15 min with the STAT3
inhibitor (Stattic, 5 µM) followed by stimulation with 100
nM Ang III. Our results demonstrated that Stattic signifi-
cantly downregulated Ang III-mediated IL-6 mRNA
expression by 80% and 60% in brainstem and cerebellum
astrocytes, respectively (Table 3), suggesting that STAT3
mediates Ang III-mediated IL-6 mRNA induction.
Cells were also treated with 100 nM Ang III in the pres-
ence and absence of the selective AT1
receptor antagonist
(losartan, 10 uM) or the selective AT2
receptor blocker
(PD123319, 10 uM) to determine whether Ang III stimula-
tion of IL-6 mRNA occurred through interaction at one of
the Ang receptors. Pretreatment with losartan attenuated
the expression of IL-6 mRNA by about 70% and 100% in
brainstem and cerebellar astrocytes, respectively.
PD123319, the AT2
receptor antagonist was ineffective in
preventing Ang III-mediated increases in IL-6 mRNA
expression in both brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes
(Table 3). These findings suggest that Ang III interacts
with the Ang AT1
receptor leading to STAT3 induction and
IL-6 mRNA expression.
Discussion
In recent years it has become clear that the central RAS is
important in many pathophysiological conditions including
hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarc-
tion, and diabetic nephropathy.1,2 The importance of neu-
rons in the brain is well established, but in recent years the
role of other cells such as astrocytes are now appreciated.
Specifically for the functions of the central RAS, astrocytes
have been shown to be important in the production of angi-
otensinogen, the precursor proteins for Ang II, Ang III and
other physiologically relevant peptides produced by this

system.30 Thus, it is important that we understand how pep-
tides produced by this system are regulated and the intra-
cellular signaling pathways that govern the actions of these
peptides in astrocytes. The central effects of Ang II are well
known.1,2 Ang III has recently received attention as an
important peptide produced by RAS, and even though
some controversy still exists in terms of the effects of Ang
III compared to Ang II, it is clear that the peptide is physi-
ologically important particularly in the control of blood
pressure, fluid homeostasis, and AVP release.6
Most studies delineating the effects of Ang III have
focused on the binding affinity of the peptide to AT1
recep-
tors or measured the effects of the peptide to modulate
blood pressure11,12,31 with few studies delineating the intra-
cellular mediators of these Ang III effects. The earlier
signaling pathways governing the effects of Ang III have
been the recent focus of our laboratory. In cultured rat
astrocytes, we showed that Ang III stimulated Ang AT1
receptor to induce the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and
JNK MAP kinase pathways with the same potency as Ang
II.14,15 These pathways were also shown to mediate Ang
III-induced astrocyte proliferation suggesting, at least in
astrocytes, that these MAP kinase pathways mediate Ang
III effects. In neonatal cardiac fibroblasts Ang III induced
protein synthesis, DNA synthesis and collagen synthesis/
secretion in a concentration-dependent manner.8 Blume
et al.32 demonstrated in conscious rats that Ang III induced
the expression of the transcription factors c-Fos, c-Jun and
Krox-24, effects mediated by the AT1
receptor.
In the current study we explored the ability of Ang III
to activate STAT3, a member of the JAK/STAT family of
proteins. This pathway is thought to be important in
development and homeostasis33 and is a characteristic
pathway via which several cytokines elicit their responses.
JAK/STAT signaling mediates several Ang II-induced
physiological and pathological responses,20, 34,35 effects
that apparently involve an increase in angiotensinogen
and IL-6 levels.20,23,36 IL-6 exhibits a variety of physio-
logical actions including induction of cell growth, cellu-
lar development, and inflammation; it is also involved in
several disease processes as well.19,37 The role of Ang III
in inducing IL-6 levels is unknown. However, a link
between Ang III and inflammation has been proposed. As
previously mentioned, it has been shown in rat mesangial
and mononuclear cells that Ang III has pro-inflammatory
actions.22

Here we show for the first time in astrocytes that Ang
III induces STAT3 phosphorylation leading to an increase
in IL-6 mRNA expression. This effect is mediated by the
interaction of Ang III with the Ang AT1
receptor. Most
importantly, our results showed that the effects of Ang II
and Ang III to induce STAT3 and IL-6 mRNA levels were
equipotent since the magnitude of the Ang III effects
observed in our current samples were comparable to our
previously published Ang II results for Ang II effects on
IL-6 mRNA expression.17,18 Future studies will be done to
determine whether Ang III induces IL-6 protein levels and
IL-6 protein secretion in a similar manner and pattern as
Ang II. Further, astrocytes isolated from the brainstem and
cerebellum, were equally responsive to Ang III exhibiting
similar sensitivity to the effects of the peptide to induce
both STAT3 protein and IL-6 mRNA expression.
Multiple members of the STAT family of transcription
factors are known to mediate Ang II effects23,35 but the abil-
ity of Ang III to induce STAT family of transcription factors
is unknown and the reason for our studies. We selected
STAT3 for our studies with Ang III because it protects
against apoptosis and enhances cell proliferation.38 As we
have shown previously,14 and as shown in Table 3, 100 nM
Ang III induces cell proliferation in cerebellar and brain-
stem astrocytes. Moreover, inhibition of STAT3 prevented
Ang III-mediated astrocyte proliferation. We have previ-
ously shown that Ang III stimulated the proliferation of rat
astrocytes through the Ang AT1
receptor, an effect mediated
by the ERK1/2 and JNK MAP kinase pathways.14,15 These
findings suggest that, along with the other intracellular sig-
nals mentioned, STAT3 is also involved in Ang III growth-
promoting effects as well as Ang III inflammatory actions.
Further, these studies also show that both Ang II17,18 and
Ang III can cause similar effects in astrocytes (increase
DNA synthesis), and may use similar pathways, here the
JAK2/STAT3 pathway, to achieve these effects. The mecha-
nism responsible for astrocyte proliferation caused by Ang
III-induced STAT3 activation is unknown. However,
STAT3-mediated, IL-6-dependent T cell proliferation
occurred through prevention of apoptosis suggesting a pos-
sible pathway by which STAT3 may promote astrocyte pro-
liferation.39 Future studies will be geared at determining the
mechanism(s) by which this peptide induces STAT3 leading
to an increase in DNA synthesis.
It is apparent that activated astrocytes contribute to cen-
tral inflammatory effects and tissue repair as a participant
in the local innate immune response triggered by a variety
of insults.40,41 Astrocytes display an array of receptors
involved in innate immunity, and astrocyte activation leads
to cellular proliferation and secretion of a number of solu-
ble mediators, including IL-6, which impacts immune
responses.42­44 Thus, it is important to study the pathways
that lead to local immune responses (here, IL-6 production
and astrocyte proliferation) in the brain. Moreover, it has
been shown that STAT3 is a key regulator of reactive
astrocytes in the healing process after spinal cord injury
also suggesting a role for this mediator in central inflam-
matory processes involving astrocytes.45 In this study, we
are using an astrocyte-enriched culture system that to some
extent is contaminated with microglia. Since cultured
microglia express components of the RAS, and STAT3 is
present in these cells, it is possible that the astrocyte
response we detect in this study is influenced by the small
numbers of microglia.46,47
Over the last two decades, the RAS has become much
more complex with the identification of novel peptides
such as Ang III that exhibit biological activity. Ang III
interacts at the same receptor as Ang II and is produced
from the same precursor molecule angiotensinogen by a
series of reactions which included conversion of Ang II to
Ang III by the enzyme aminopeptidase A.6 This has led to
the discovery of a number of physiological effects that are
similar between Ang II and Ang III. Actually, it has been
theorized that in the central nervous system it is Ang III
that is the active peptide not Ang II.12,48,49 However, this
theory has been invalidated due to a number of studies that
have shown otherwise.50­52
Ang II role in inflammation has been investigated in a
number of systems;53­56 however, the role of Ang III in
inflammatory processes is unknown. Thus, it is important
that we delineate whether Ang III also plays a key role in
inflammation since a dysregulated central RAS is thought
to be involved in inflammatory processes due to the sig-
nificant increase in the production of brain angiotensino-
gen during an inflammatory response.57 In addition, during
cold injury angiotensinogen-deficient mice exhibits an
attenuated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expres-
sion and decreased laminin levels in astrocytes; these defi-
ciencies result in an incomplete reconstitution of the blood
brain barrier.58 These findings suggest that during inflam-
mation or physical trauma to the brain, there is dysregula-
tion in the RAS which may lead to astrocyte proliferation
and activation. Activated astrocytes, as previously men-
tioned, are important in the body's response to inflamma-
tion. Most importantly, this dysregulated RAS may involve
effects of Ang II and Ang III as well.
Indeed in our previous studies, we have shown that Ang
II increases mRNA expression and release of the pro-
inflammatory cytokine IL-6 from astrocytes, effects that
were mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway.17 Here we show
for the first time that Ang III also acts in a similar manner
inducing STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-6 mRNA expres-
sion. STAT3 and the AT1
receptor were shown to mediate
this Ang III effect. It is significant that Ang III induces
IL-6 mRNA levels since this cytokine is a known mediator
of inflammation.18,19,59 Since Ang III induces IL-6 expres-
sion in a similar manner as Ang II, and these two peptides
other physiological effects are mostly similar, it is plausi-
ble that both peptides may promote inflammatory pro-
cesses in the brain via this inflammatory cytokine.

Conclusion
Our studies are important in delineating RAS pathways
that may be important in inflammatory responses in areas
of the central nervous system known to express Ang recep-
tors and associated signaling pathways. It is important to
establish an association between inflammatory pathways
and the RAS since these systems on their own are associ-
ated with diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease,
heart failure, and hypertension. Deleterious interactions
between these two systems could make these conditions
even more prevalent and validate the importance of study-
ing connections/crosstalk between these systems in the
brain in particular in glial cells.
