Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Hip Fracture Risk in Older U.S.
White Adults
Anne C Looker and Michael E Mussolino
ABSTRACT: We used serum 25(OH)D data from NHANES III and incident hip fracture cases identified
using linked mortality and Medicare records, and found that serum 25(OH)D was significantly related to
reduced hip fracture risk in non-Hispanic white adults 65 yr of age.
Introduction: The role of vitamin D status in reducing fracture risk is unclear. We examined the relationship
between serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and incident hip fracture risk in older non-Hispanic white
adults.
Materials and Methods: The study sample consisted of 1917 white men and women 65 yr of age who were
examined in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988­1994), a
nationally representative survey. Incident hip fractures were ascertained using linked mortality and Medicare
records that were obtained for NHANES III participants. Serum 25(OH)D values were measured with a
radioimmunoassay kit. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of hip
fracture by serum 25(OH)D level.
Results: There were 156 incident hip fracture cases in the sample. Cases were older, had lower BMD and body
mass index, more prevalent spine or wrist fractures and weight loss before baseline, and ate fewer kilocalories
and less calcium than noncases. After adjusting for these differences, serum 25(OH)D values exceeding 60 nM
were significantly related to hip fracture risk. For example, the multivariate-adjusted RR was 0.64 (95% CI,
0.46­0.89) among individuals with serum 25(OH)D values 62.5 nM compared with those with values below
this level. When grouped into quartiles, the multivariate-adjusted RR for the second, third, and fourth versus
the first quartile of serum 25(OH)D were 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25­1.00), 0.41 (95% CI, 0.24­0.70), and 0.50 (95%
CI, 0.29­0.86), respectively.
Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D was related to a significantly lower hip fracture risk in this cohort of older white
adults, even after adjusting for several relevant confounding variables. The relationship did not seem to be
linear across all values. Our results support other studies suggesting that serum 25(OH)D values exceeding 60
nM are associated with health benefits.

INTRODUCTION
THE IMPORTANCE OF vitamin D in maintaining skeletal
health has been recognized for many years, but its role
in reducing fracture risk is still unclear. Serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the preferred indicator of
vitamin D status, because it reflects both dietary intake and
photoconversion of vitamin D precursors in the skin on
exposure to UV radiation.(1) Most data relating vitamin D
to fracture risk to date have come either from randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplements or from
retrospective case-control studies, in which vitamin D status
is compared between fracture cases and noncases at the
time of fracture or shortly after the fracture has occurred.
Results from the case-control studies support a role for
serum 25(OH)D in fracture risk,(2­7) but their study design
is not optimal because vitamin D status could be affected by
the fracture. Results from RCTs, which use a rigorous study
design, have conflicted,(8­11) possibly because the initial vi-
tamin D status of the study population was not clearly de-
fined. In specific, most RCTs published to date collected
serum 25(OH)D data for a subset of study participants
only. The possibility that initial vitamin D status of the
study sample in these RCTS differed has been cited as an
explanation for their disparate results, because individuals
with greater degrees of deficiency are likely to benefit from
supplemental vitamin D more than individuals with milder
deficiency.(12,13)
Other problems have been noted with RCTs, such as
noncompliance, loss of subjects because of dropout, and,

for studies of nutrients like vitamin D, inability to ethically
create a control group with no or very low intake of the
nutrient.(14) As a result, cohort studies may be able to pro-
vide data to complement information obtained in RCTs.
However, to date, only a small number of prospective ob-
servational studies have related serum 25(OH)D to fracture
risk. Several have focused on ill patients and are limited to
a small number of fracture cases.(15­17) Two exceptions
come from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF)(18)
and the Malmo Osteoporosis Prospective Risk Assessment
(OPRA) study.(19) Results from SOF indicated a protective
relationship between the active circulating form of vitamin
D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), but not with serum 25(OH)D
levels.(18) In the OPRA study, serum 25(OH)D values <50
nM were associated with a significantly increased risk of
fracture, but values <75 nM were not.(19)
To help fill the gap in information about serum 25(OH)D
and fracture risk, this study uses prospective data to exam-
ine the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and hip frac-
ture risk in older U.S. white adults. We examined this re-
lationship using serum 25(OH)D data collected in the third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III, 1988­1994) and incident hip fracture as-
sessed using linked mortality and Medicare records for
NHANES III participants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample
The baseline data for this study came from NHANES III,
which was conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, to assess the health and nutritional status of a large
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized, civilian
population of the United States. Data were collected in
NHANES III through household interviews and standard-
ized physical examinations conducted in specially equipped
mobile examination centers.(20) NHANES III participants
self-reported their race and ethnicity using categories based
on the 1977 Office of Management and Budget direc-
tive.(21) The NCHS Institutional Review Board approved
all procedures in the survey, and all subjects provided writ-
ten informed consent.
The study was given a longitudinal component by using
linked data from Medicare enrollment and claims records
and from the NHANES III Linked Mortality File. Medi-
care enrollment and use data were available for NHANES
III respondents who agreed to provide personal identifica-
tion.(22) Of the 7394 eligible respondents 65 yr of age at
the time of Medicare linkage, 7087 (96%) were successfully
validated and matched with Medicare administrative re-
cords. Medicare claims data were provided from 1991
through 2000 for respondents who participated in fee-for-
service care (claims data were not available for those who
enrolled in Medicare managed care plans). In this study,
claims data from the following files were used: Medicare
Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) Inpatient Hos-
pital Stay File, MEDPAR Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)
File, Carrier Standard Analytic File, and Outpatient Stan-
dard Analytic File. The Medicare Denominator files were
used to restrict the analytic sample to those who were suc-
cessfully matched to the Medicare claims data, as well as to
obtain information about enrollment in managed care
plans.
Vital status of study participants was determined from
the NHANES III Linked Mortality File.(23) This file con-
tains mortality follow-up data based on a probabilistic
match between the eligible NHANES III sample and the
National Death Index (NDI). Vital status data are available
for individuals from the date of their participation in the
NHANES III survey through December 31, 2000. In addi-
tion to data on vital status, information on underlying and
multiple causes of death are available in this file.
The analytic sample in this study was restricted to indi-
viduals 65 yr of age at the time of their NHANES III
interview at baseline, because Medicare provides compre-
hensive health care for roughly 98% of the U.S. population
in this age range.(24) The sample was also restricted to non-
Hispanic whites, because there was an insufficient number
of hip fracture cases in other race/ethnic groups to permit
separate analyses by this variable, and differences in cal-
cium and vitamin D metabolism between races could sig-
nificantly complicate interpretation of results for all races
combined. Of the 2540 non-Hispanic white adults 65 yr of
age who were interviewed and examined in NHANES III at
baseline, the following were excluded: (1) 90 persons who
did not match the Medicare files; (2) 1 person who lacked
cause of death information on their death certificate; (3) 5
persons who were lost to follow-up; (4) 121 prevalent hip
fracture cases at baseline; (5) 84 individuals who were en-
rolled in Medicare managed care plans at the time of their
baseline examination; and (6) 322 persons with missing data
for serum 25(OH)D or for any of the other confounding
variables used in the multivariate models. After excluding a
total of 623 individuals, 1917 (75%) of the original 2540
eligible individuals were included in the final analytic
sample.
We compared descriptive characteristics and risk factors
between the analytic sample and persons who were ex-
cluded from the analytic sample to assess the potential for
nonresponse bias in our results. The respondents who were
excluded from our sample differed significantly from the
analytic sample as follows: they were older (75 versus 73
yr), had lower serum 25(OH)D (68 versus 73 nM), and
lower femur neck BMD (0.64 versus 0.69 gm/cm2). They
were also more likely to report poor/fair health (33% versus
26%), more likely to have had a fracture before baseline
(30% versus 12%), and more likely to report being less
physically active than others of their same age and sex (22%
versus 11%).
Hip fracture case identification
Hip fracture cases were identified using diagnosis and
procedure codes from the linked Medicare records or cause
of death information from the NHANES III Linked Mor-
tality File.
Hip fracture cases were defined from Medicare records
using an approach that was developed by Ray et al.(25)
LOOKER AND MUSSOLINO
144
based on a study in which they compared data collected
from medical records with Medicare claims data. Following
this approach, we used medical records from both hospital
(MEDPAR Inpatient Hospital Stay File) and nonhospital
(MEDPAR Skilled Nursing Facility File, Carrier Standard
Analytic File, and Outpatient Standard Analytic File) files
to identify hip fracture cases. Criteria for defining hip frac-
ture depended on the source of the medical record (gener-
ally more stringent for nonhospital files than hospital files)
and type of code (generally more stringent for procedure
codes than for diagnosis codes). For example, persons with
an inpatient hospital medical record containing a diagnosis
of ICD-9-CM code 820 in any of the 10 diagnosis codes
provided was defined as a hip fracture case unless there was
a concurrent code indicating care for a previous fracture or
other bone disease. However, persons with a hospital inpa-
tient medical record containing ICD codes for procedures
related to hip fracture but without a diagnosis code had to
have a concurrent carrier, outpatient, or SNF medical re-
cord with a diagnosis code of 820. An exception to the
requirement for a concurrent procedure and diagnosis code
was made for persons with a carrier, outpatient, or SNF
medical record containing Current Procedural Terminology
(CPT) codes for selected surgical procedures related to the
hip; presence of these CPT codes was considered sufficient
to define a case without a concurrent diagnosis code. De-
tails regarding the definition of cases from Medicare re-
cords, including specific codes, are provided in Appendix 1.
Persons with an ICD-9 code 820 or ICD-10 code S72.0-
S72.2 listed as an underlying or multiple cause of death on
their death certificate were also considered to be hip frac-
ture cases.
A total of 156 hip fracture cases were identified in the
analytic sample used in this study: 14 cases were identified
from both Medicare and death records, 140 cases were
identified from Medicare records only, and 2 cases were
identified from death records only.
The vast majority of cases (n  143; 92%) in our analytic
sample had diagnoses consistent with hip fracture on re-
cords from more than one source (e.g., inpatient hospital,
SNF, carrier, outpatient and/or death records). Likewise,
88% of those with a hospital record containing a discharge
diagnosis of 820 also had relevant surgical codes for hip
fracture.
We did not exclude cases on the basis of trauma, because
recent data suggest that osteoporosis may contribute to
fractures associated with high trauma.(26) There were 20 hip
fracture cases with ICD codes consistent with trauma (ICD-
9-CM 800­819, 821­829, 860­869, 870­897, 925­929).(27)
Variables
Serum 25(OH)D was assayed with a radioimmunoassay
(RIA) kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, USA) at the primary
environmental and nutrition health laboratory for
NHANES at the National Center for Environmental
Health, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA. The assay CV was 10­
25% for lower values (20­62.5 nM) and 12­18% for high
values (85­147.5 nM). Long-term performance of this labo-
ratory in the international Vitamin D External Quality As-
sessment Scheme (DEQAS) proficiency testing program
was excellent. Details of the assay method have been pub-
lished elsewhere.(28)
Serum 25(OH)D was examined both as a continuous and
categorical variable. Categories were created using several
cut-off values (40, 50, 62.5, and 75 nM). These particular
categories were chosen in part because they provided a
sufficient number of fracture cases above and below the
cut-off value. In addition, they reflect the range of different
values that have proposed as reflecting optimal vitamin D
status.(29­31) Serum 25(OH)D was also examined as quar-
tiles based on the serum 25(OH)D distribution observed in
fracture cases.
Several potential confounding variables were evaluated
for use in multivariate models. Confounders that were mea-
sured during the physical examination included femur neck
BMD, which was measured by DXA (QDR 1000; Hologic,
Waltham, MA, USA), and body weight and height, which
were used to calculate body mass index (BMI, equal to
body weight [kg] divided by height [m2]).(20)
Potential confounding variables obtained by interview at
baseline included age, kilocalories, and calcium from food
(mg/d) from a 24-h recall, self-reported wrist or spine frac-
ture, smoking status (current, former, never), alcohol con-
sumption (drinks per month), physical activity level com-
pared with others of the same age and sex (same, higher,
lower), self-rated health status (excellent/very good/good
versus fair/poor), number of falls in the past year, weight
loss from maximum adult weight excluding pregnancy
(-5%, -6% to -10%, >-10%), maternal history of osteo-
porosis or hip fracture, ever use of postmenopausal hor-
mones, and self-reported doctor's diagnosis of chronic con-
ditions (congestive heart disease, chronic bronchitis,
diabetes, goiter or other thyroid disease, heart attack, or
stroke). Because NHANES examinations are performed in
southern latitudes during the winter and northern latitudes
during the summer, latitude and month of blood collection
were also evaluated as potential confounders.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SUDAAN soft-
ware(32) for analysis of data from complex sample surveys.
Weighted incidence rates for hip fracture were calculated
per 10,000 person-years of follow-up. Descriptive charac-
teristics and risk factors at baseline were compared between
fracture cases and noncases using linear regression models
and 2 analyses. The following variables were included as
confounding variables in multivariate models because they
differed significantly between cases and noncases at base-
line: age, sex, femur neck BMD, BMI, previous fracture,
dietary calcium, kilocalories, and weight loss from maxi-
mum.
To control for all risk factors simultaneously and to ac-
count for unequal length of follow-up, Cox proportional
hazards models were used to model time to event and to
calculate estimates of the relative risk of hip fracture. For
cases, length of follow-up was calculated as the time from
date of examination to date of diagnosis or procedure for
those identified by Medicare records or date of death for
SERUM 25(OH)D AND HIP FRACTURE RISK 145
those identified by death certificates. For noncases, follow-
up time was calculated as time from baseline exam to date
of death for decedents, date of entry into managed care for
those who enrolled in a Medicare managed care program,
or end of follow-up on December 31, 2000 for those who
did not fall into the first two categories. A test of the pro-
portional hazards assumption did not indicate a signifi-
cantly increasing or decreasing trend in the relative risk
(RR) with time (p  0.54), which suggests that the assump-
tion is not violated.
Differences in the relationship between hip fracture and
serum 25(OH)D by sex were examined by including an
interaction term in a separate Cox proportional hazards
model that included age and sex only. Because the interac-
tion term was not significant, results were combined for
both sexes, and all models were adjusted for sex in addition
to age.
The population attributable risk (PAR) of hip fracture
for serum 25(OH)D was calculated using a formula that
accounts for confounding(33): PAR  pd[(RR ­ 1)/RR],

where pd  proportion of cases exposed to the risk factor
and RR is the multivariate-adjusted estimate. The PAR
depends on the prevalence of the risk factor in addition to
the RR estimate, so it can vary for different cut-off values.
Thus, we calculated the PAR for two serum 25(OH)D cut-
offs (<40 and <62.5 nM) to reflect the PAR for cut-offs in
the range of values that have been used to define low vita-
min D status.
Secondary analyses were performed to assess the impact
of lack of Medicare data for the analytic sample before
1991, as well as to assess the effect of including hip fracture
cases that may have been caused by trauma. Specifically,
RR were calculated after restricting the sample to individu-
als whose baseline examination occurred in 1991 or later, or
after deleting cases with trauma-associated codes. We also
estimated the number of hip fracture cases that might have
occurred among whites 65 yr of age in the NHANES III
sample before 1991, based on age-adjusted mortality rates
for the NHANES III sample and age-adjusted incidence of
hip fracture in 1988­1989 among whites from the National
Hospital Discharge Survey.(34)
RESULTS
Mean serum 25(OH)D in the total sample at baseline was
71.9 ± 25.3 (SD) nM. Eight percent had serum 25(OH)D
values <40 nM, 19% had values <50 nM, 38% had values
<62.5 nM, and 60% had values <75 nM.
Baseline characteristics of hip fracture cases versus non-
cases are compared by sex in Table 1. Fracture cases of both
sexes were older, had lower femur neck BMD, ate fewer
kilocalories, and consumed less calcium than noncases. Se-
rum 25(OH)D levels and BMI were significantly lower
among cases than noncases in women but not in men. Fe-
male cases were also significantly more likely to report a
previous spine or wrist fracture and a weight loss of >10%
from maximum than noncases. None of the other variables
tested differed significantly between hip fracture cases and
noncases at baseline.
Incidence rates for hip fracture by age and sex for the
non-Hispanic whites in the analytic sample are shown in
Table 2. Rates were substantially higher in those 80 yr of
age compared with the younger age group. Women had a
higher hip fracture incidence than men. Mean age at frac-
ture was 82.2 yr for men and 82.3 yr for women. Mean
length of follow-up time was 6.7 yr for the total analytic
sample.
The relative risk of hip fracture associated with increas-
ing serum 25(OH)D levels is shown in Table 3. When ad-
justed for age and sex, serum 25(OH)D was significantly
related to hip fracture risk, whether examined as a continu-
ous variable or in categories. Hip fracture risk was reduced
by 21% for each SD increase (SD  25.3 nM) in serum
25(OH)D levels when examined as a continuous variable
after adjusting for age and sex. However, adjusting for all
significant confounders weakened the relationship between
serum vitamin D when analyzed as a continuous variable;
risk was 18% lower per SD increase, and the relationship
was no longer statistically significant.
When examined using cut-points in the range of 40­62.5
nM, serum 25(OH)D was significantly related to hip frac-
ture risk even after adjusting for significant confounders. In
specific, the reduction in hip fracture risk ranged from 36%
to 60% for these three cut-off values after adjusting for all
confounders. However, when a cut-off of 75 nM was used,
the reduction in hip fracture risk (14%) was no longer
statistically significant.
There was a significant trend in risk reduction when se-
rum 25(OH)D was examined by quartile, but the trend did
not seem to be linear across all values (Table 3). Specifi-
cally, compared with the lowest serum 25(OH)D quartile,
the RR in the third quartile was lower than that in the
second quartile, but the RR estimate in the fourth quartile
was similar or higher than that in the third quartile. Fur-
thermore, the 95% CIs for the RR in all three upper quar-
tiles overlapped, and results of t-tests comparing differences
in the  coefficients corresponding to these RR estimates
were not significant (data not shown).
Estimates of the PAR of hip fracture for serum 25(OH)D
were 11% for values <40 nM and 18% for values <62.5 nM.
Results of secondary analyses suggested that lack of data
on hip fracture occurrence before 1991 and inclusion of
cases that may have been caused by trauma were unlikely
to have affected results in an important way. In specific,
age- and sex-adjusted RR estimates from these secondary
analyses differed from those in the main analysis by 0.04 or
less. Finally, only 13 hip fracture cases were projected to
have occurred in the analytic sample before 1991.
DISCUSSION
Serum 25(OH)D values exceeding roughly 60 nM were
associated with a significantly lower risk of hip fracture in
this cohort of older white men and women, even after ad-
justing for several relevant confounders. Results were not
linear across all values, however, as shown by the similarity
of the RR estimates in the upper three quartiles of serum
25(OH)D values.
Our results contrast with those reported from the SOF, in
which no relationship was found between serum 25(OH)D
and hip fracture risk.(18) Possible reasons for the discrep-
ancy include differences in study sample, study design, hip
fracture ascertainment, and serum 25(OH)D assays.
Women in this study were older, less likely to be current
smokers, and consumed somewhat less calcium than the
women in the SOF sample. The SOF sample also did not

include men. Differences in study design also exist: SOF
used a case-cohort design to examine the question, whereas
our study prospectively followed all respondents who met
criteria for inclusion into the analytic sample. Ascertain-
ment of hip fractures differed between studies as well, with
SOF confirming fractures by review of radiographs ob-
tained at the time of hospitalization for fracture, whereas
this study relied on hip fracture diagnoses obtained from
Medicare records and death certificates. Finally, assay dif-
ferences could also potentially have played a role, because
serum 25(OH)D assays are not standardized, and different
assays have been shown to produce different results for the
same specimens.(35) Although both this study and SOF used
a radioimmunoassay to measure serum 25(OH)D levels,
the specific assay used in SOF was not stated, so the degree
of comparability between the assays in the two studies can-
not be firmly determined.
The definition of optimal serum 25(OH)D values is
currently under debate, especially because recent data
suggest that optimal vitamin D status may be associated
with a higher range of values than has been used in the
past.(8,9,29­31,36­38) Results from our analyses of serum
25(OH)D as a categorical variable found health benefits for
those with values that fall within the recently proposed
range: those with values 62.5 nM had a 36% lower risk
than those with values below this level, and risk was signifi-
cantly reduced in the two upper quartiles of serum
25(OH)D [in which serum 25(OH)D exceeded 61 nM]
compared with those with values in the lowest quartile
(in which values fell below 43 nM). However, our results do
not provide strong support for continued risk reduction
as serum 25(OH) values increase above these levels. For
example, hip fracture risk was not significantly lower in
those with values 75 versus <75 nM. Gerdhem et al.(19)
also found no significant relationship between fracture risk
and serum 25(OH)D values when a cut-off of 75 nM was
used. Furthermore, in this study, the RR point estimate was
lower in the third quartile (median and range of 70 and
61.1­82.5 nM, respectively) than in the fourth quartile (me-
dian and range of 100 and >82.5 nM, respectively), which
suggests that risk did not decline further as values exceeded
83 nM. However, the confidence limits for the RR in the
third and fourth quartiles overlapped, and t-tests to assess
differences between quartiles were not significant, so firm
conclusions regarding the category with the lowest risk can-
not be drawn. The number of hip fracture cases in each
serum 25(OH)D quartile in our study was somewhat lim-
ited, so that power to detect significant differences in rela-
tive risks between quartiles was not ideal.
Our estimate of the PAR using a serum 25(OH)D cut-off
of 62.5 nM suggests that 18% of hip fracture cases in the
population could be prevented if serum values under this
cut-off were eliminated.(33) This compares favorably with
PARs of coronary heart disease estimated for common car-
diovascular risk factors such as smoking, high systolic blood
pressure, or high serum cholesterol,(39) and with PARs of
any non-spine nontraumatic fracture estimated for osteo-
porotic BMD values at the total spine or total hip.(40) It is
important to note that PARs depend on the prevalence of
the risk factor in the population in addition to the strength
of its relationship with the disease, and thus may vary if
different cut-off values are used. Other important issues
regarding PARs include the assumption of a causal rela-
tionship between the risk factor and disease, avoidance of
incorrectly interpreting the PAR as the proportion of cases
having the risk factor, and the need to properly account for
confounding in their calculation.(33)
Limitations of this study include a relatively small num-
ber of hip fracture cases that were identified using Medicare
and death records without confirmation by X-ray. The fact
that almost all cases had codes consistent with hip fracture
on multiple medical records should reduce the probability

that identified cases did not suffer a hip fracture. However,
some cases may have been mistakenly classified as non-
cases, especially because Medicare records before 1991
were not available. This number is likely to be small: we
estimated that 13 undetected hip fracture cases may have
occurred in our sample during 1988­1990. Furthermore,
misclassification of cases as noncases would likely tend to
attenuate the RR estimates observed between hip fracture
risk and serum 25(OH)D.
Our results also apply only to the segment of the white
population 65 yr of age that was not institutionalized at
baseline and participated in Medicare fee-for-service pro-
grams (e.g., medical records for respondents who received
care from managed care programs or in Veterans Admin-
istration facilities were not available). Thus, although based
on a cohort that was derived from a nationally representa-
tive sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population
at baseline, our results cannot be used to generalize to the
entire white adult population >65 yr of age. Furthermore,
exclusions for missing data or loss to follow-up were also
made. The respondents who were excluded from our
sample were more likely to have several characteristics that
are associated with greater hip fracture risk [older, lower
serum 25(OH)D and femur neck BMD, poorer health,
more fractures at baseline, and less activity] than respon-
dents who were included. Thus, our results may potentially
underestimate the relationship between serum 25(OH)D
and hip fracture risk among older white adults to some
extent.
In conclusion, serum 25(OH)D was significantly related
to hip fracture risk in this cohort of older white adults even
after adjusting for several other relevant confounding vari-
ables. Our results suggest that this relationship may not be
linear across all values. Future matches of the NHANES III
sample with Medicare records and the National Death In-
dex may identify additional hip fracture cases in this cohort,
and thus provide the opportunity to examine the relation-
ship between vitamin D status and hip fracture risk with
greater power and in greater depth.

APPENDIX 1: HIP FRACTURE CASE
IDENTIFICATION FROM MEDICARE
RECORDS
Hip fracture cases from Medicare records were defined as fol-
lows.
Persons with an inpatient hospital medical record containing a
diagnosis of ICD-9-CM code 820 in any of the 10 diagnosis codes
provided unless there was a concurrent code indicating care for a
previous fracture or other bone disease: late effects of fracture
(code 905.4), implant complication (codes 996.4, 996.6, 996.7,
E878.1), aseptic necrosis (733.4), malunion of bone (773.8), other
disorders of bone or cartilage (733.9), bone or bone marrow can-
cer (198.5), or fracture follow-up care (V540, V664, V674).
Persons with a hospital inpatient medical record containing a
procedure code for internal fixation of the femur (ICD-9-CM
code 78.55), open/closed reduction of femur fracture with or with-
out internal fixation (codes 79.05, 79.15, 79.25, 79.35), or debride-
ment of open femur fracture site (code 79.65), or selected hip
replacement codes (partial replacement, 81.52 or revision of re-
placement, 81.53) AND a carrier, outpatient, or skilled nursing
facility (SNF) medical record with a diagnosis code of 820.
Persons with a carrier, outpatient, or SNF medical record con-
taining Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for selected
surgical procedures related to the hip (CPT codes 27125­27127,
27230, 27232, 27234­27236, 27238, 27240, 27242, 27244, 27246,
27248).
Persons with a carrier, outpatient, or SNF medical record con-
taining CPT codes for other selected surgical procedures related
to the hip (27130­27131, 29010, 29015, 29020, 29025, 29035, 29040,
29044, 29046, 29305, 29325, 29345, 29355, 29359, 29365, 29505,
29520, 29799) AND a diagnosis code of 820 plus no concurrent
codes indicating hip arthroplasty for treatment of arthritis.
Persons with a carrier, outpatient, or SNF medical record con-
taining both a principle diagnosis of ICD-9 code 820 and a CPT
procedure code indicating that a hip X-ray was performed, with
the following exceptions: records for the same date that also con-
tained codes indicating arthritis or arthroplasty for arthritis; the
source of the 820 code was emergency medicine or ambulance; or
if a principle diagnosis which was not code 820 was available from
either diagnostic radiology or orthopedic surgery.
These definitions are based on the approach developed by Ray
et al.(25) for identification of fractures from Medicare records.
