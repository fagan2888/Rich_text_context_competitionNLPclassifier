Background: The health care system
provides an important opportunity for
addressing tobacco use among youths,
but there is little information about
how frequently physicians discuss
smoking with their adolescent patients.
We analyzed data from the National
Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys to
assess the prevalence and the predic-
tors of physicians' identification of
smoking status and counseling about
smoking at office visits by adolescents.
Methods: From 1991 through 1996,
5087 physicians recorded data on
16648 visits by adolescents aged 11­21
years. We determined the proportion of
office visits at which physicians identi-
fied an adolescent's smoking status and
counseled about smoking and then
identified predictors of these outcomes
with logistic regression. Statistical tests
were two-sided. Results: In 1991, phy-
sicians identified an adolescent's smok-
ing status at 72.4% of visits but pro-
vided smoking counseling at only 1.6%
of all adolescent visits and 16.9% of vis-
its by adolescents identified as smokers.
These proportions did not increase
from 1991 through 1996. Compared
with specialists, primary care physi-
cians were more likely to identify
smoking status (odds ratio [OR] = 1.70;
95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.53­
1.89) and to counsel about smoking
(OR = 3.43; 95% CI = 2.18­5.38). Pa-
tients with diagnoses of conditions po-
tentially complicated by smoking were
more likely to have their smoking sta-
tus identified and to be counseled about
smoking. Younger and nonwhite ado-
lescents were less likely to be counseled
about smoking than older and white
teens. Conclusions: We found that phy-
sicians frequently identified adoles-
cents' smoking status but rarely coun-
seled them about smoking. Physicians'
practices did not improve in the first
half of the 1990s, despite a clear con-
sensus about the importance of this ac-
tivity and the publication of physician
guidelines targeting this population.
Physicians treating adolescents are
missing opportunities to discourage to-
bacco use among teens. [J Natl Cancer
Inst 1999;91:1857­62]
Nearly 90% of cigarette smokers
smoke their first cigarette before the age
of 18 years (1), and it is estimated that 5
million premature smoking-related deaths
will occur among the youths who were
aged 0­17 years in 1995 (2). These facts,
coupled with the rising prevalence of
smoking among U.S. adolescents (3),
have led to a national focus on preventing
and treating smoking in this age group.
Because more than 70% of adolescents
are seen by a physician yearly (4,5), the
health care system provides an important
opportunity for addressing smoking
among youths. Children and adolescents
perceive physicians to be credible health
experts and may heed their advice more
than that of their parents or other adults
(1,6). The American Medical Associa-
tion's Guidelines for Adolescent Preven-
tive Services (AMA GAPS) recommends
that adolescents from ages 11 to 21 years
visit the physician annually (7). These
visits provide an opportunity for physi-
cians to prevent and deter tobacco use (1).
Brief physician counseling has been
shown to increase the smoking cessation
rates of adult patients (8­10), but the ef-
ficacy of physician counseling to prevent
tobacco use among adolescents has not
yet been demonstrated. Nonetheless,
since the late 1980s, numerous organiza-
tions have made recommendations about
smoking prevention and cessation for
physicians who treat children and adoles-
cents (7,9­15). Age-specific guidelines
for adolescents and young adults devel-
oped by the National Cancer Institute and
the American Academy of Pediatrics en-
courage physicians to make repeated brief
interventions that include the following:
1) asking adolescents at every visit
whether they or their friends use tobacco,
2) advising tobacco users to stop, 3) con-
gratulating patients who do not use to-
bacco, and 4) advising abstinence (13). In
addition, the American Academy of Fam-
ily Physicians, the AMA GAPS, the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force, the Ma-
ternal and Child Health Bureau, and the
Agency for Health Care Policy and Re-
search recommend that physicians ac-
tively screen and counsel adolescents
about tobacco use (7,9­12,15). National
health promotion goals for the year 2000
include decreasing the rate of adolescent
smoking and increasing the rate of physi-
cian counseling (14).
Despite consensus that physicians
should address smoking with adolescent
patients, there is little information about
how well physicians comply with these
recommendations. A majority of Massa-
chusetts pediatricians surveyed in 1995
and 1996 reported that they assessed
smoking status and provided advice to
stop smoking to "most" or "all" of their
patients and that they encouraged "most"
or "all" of the children and adolescents
not to start using tobacco (16). However,
in a retrospective review of 250 preven-
tive visits by adolescents, physicians in a
health maintenance organization provided
"anticipatory guidance" about use of ciga-
rettes at only 6% of all visits (17), and in
Northern California surveys conducted
between 1979 through 1990, only 14%
of the adolescent smokers who had seen
a physician in the past year reported ever
being advised by a physician to quit (5).
An analysis of the 1990 National Ambu-
latory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS)
reported that physicians counseled ado-
lescents about smoking at only 1% of
the visits (18). We analyzed the subse-
quent 6 years of data from the NAMCS,
an ongoing annual survey of U.S. physi-
cians, to assess more recent data and to
determine clinical predictors of physi-

cians' treatment of smoking at adolescent
visits. Specifically, we investigated whether
a physician's specialty and a patient's di-
agnoses would influence the likelihood
that smoking was addressed during an of-
fice visit because these factors have been
shown to predict the frequency at which
smoking counseling is provided to adult
patients (19­23).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
NAMCS is an ongoing annual survey of U.S. of-
fice-based physicians conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) (24). Doctors of
medicine and osteopathy are selected by stratified
random sampling from American Medical Associa-
tion and American Osteopathic Association listings
of all practicing office-based physicians in the
United States. The unit of analysis is the patient
visit. Each participating physician, aided by his or
her office staff, completes a one-page encounter
form after ambulatory care visits. Outpatient care
provided in hospital settings and by telephone is
excluded. Physicians record information about pa-
tient demographics, smoking status, expected source
of payment, reasons for the visit, diagnoses, coun-
seling and education provided, and current medica-
tions. The cross-sectional nature of NAMCS permits
patterns in physician practices to be followed over
time but does not allow individual physicians or pa-
tients to be followed longitudinally.
The NCHS uses a complex three-stage sampling
design, which has previously been described in de-
tail (25). The first stage involves probability samples
of counties or groups of counties, and the second
stage consists of a probability sample of practicing
physicians stratified by specialty. The final stage
involves sampling of patient visits from a random
week of a physician's practice and a systematic ran-
dom sample of those visits (i.e., every third visit),
depending on the size of the practice (24). To pro-
duce unbiased national estimates, each patient visit
is assigned an inflation factor called the "patient
visit weight" on the basis of the probability of se-
lection, the differences in physicians' response rates,
and the specialty distributions. We modified these
weights by use of proportional scaling via the
method of Potthoff et al. (26) to derive effective
sample sizes for use in statistical testing. All esti-
mates presented in the results of this study are per-
centages weighted to reflect national estimates. The
weighted percentages presented in this report may
not always match percentage directly calculated
from the different outcome data described here with-
out taking into consideration the weighting. The
NCHS provides relative standard errors for esti-
mates to gauge the reliability of an estimate for an
individual year (24). The relative standard error of
an estimate is obtained by dividing the standard er-
ror of the estimate by the estimate itself and is ex-
pressed as a percentage of the estimate (24). An
estimate with a relative standard error greater than
30% could be unreliable (24).
We analyzed data collected from 1991, when
smoking status was first included on the survey,
through 1996, the most recent year available. The
methods were similar to our previous analysis of the
treatment of smoking in adult patients (19). Physi-
cian response rates varied between 70% and 73% for
the 6 years (24). All visits by adolescent patients
aged 11­21 years were included (7,15,27). We ex-
amined changes in physician practices from 1991
through 1996 and then combined data from all six
annual surveys to describe factors associated with
these practices. We examined three outcomes: 1)
identification of patients' smoking status, 2) provi-
sion of smoking counseling at all visits, and 3) pro-
vision of smoking counseling at visits by smokers.
Physicians identified a patient's smoking status by
answering the question, "Does patient smoke ciga-
rettes?" Smoking status was categorized as known if
the box was checked "yes" or "no." Smoking status
was unknown if the box was checked "unknown" or
if no answer was provided. Physicians recorded
smoking counseling by checking the appropriate box
under the section "counseling/education." For the
years 1991 through 1994, this box was labeled
"smoking cessation"; for the years 1995 and 1996,
the box was labeled "tobacco use/exposure." Data
were available from 5087 physicians on 16 648 of-
fice visits by adolescent patients from 1991 through
1996.
Statistical Analysis
Independent predictors of smoking status identi-
fication and smoking counseling were determined
with multiple logistic regression (28). Adjusted odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were calculated from these multiple logistic regres-
sion models. Tests of statistical significance were
two-sided. Covariates included in the models for the
three outcomes and used for adjustment of the ORs
were survey year, patient demographics (age, sex,
and race), metropolitan statistical area, expected
payment source for the visit, diagnoses, and physi-
cian specialty. Race was categorized as white (non-
Hispanic) and nonwhite. The nonwhite category
could not be subdivided further because of small
numbers. Three categories of diagnoses were as-
sessed as predictor variables because of their asso-
ciation with adverse outcomes from continued
smoking: asthma, lower respiratory infection, and
pregnancy. A fourth category, general medical ex-
amination, was included because data from adults
have shown that physicians are more likely to iden-
tify patients' smoking status and to counsel smokers
at this type of visit (19). Each category was defined
by the use of the International Classification of Dis-
eases, 9th revision, diagnosis codes (29). All diag-
nosis categories were created as binary variables,
e.g., asthma versus no asthma; therefore, each visit
could be included in more than one diagnosis cat-
egory. Physicians were categorized as primary care
(pediatricians, family practitioners, general inter-
nists, and obstetrician/gynecologists) or specialists
(all other specialties). Expected payment source for
the visit was divided into five categories: health
maintenance organization, private insurance, Med-
icaid, Medicare, and "other" insurance providers.
To further explore the association between phy-
sician intervention and the specific problem ad-
dressed during the visit, we calculated the rate of
smoking counseling for the 10 most common pri-
mary diagnoses of adolescent smokers visiting pri-
mary care physicians. A primary diagnosis is the
diagnosis associated with the patient's primary rea-
son for making the visit. We grouped clinically re-
lated primary diagnoses by use of Schneeweiss di-
agnosis clusters (30).
RESULTS
Data were available on 16 648 adoles-
cent patient visits to 5087 physicians from
1991 through 1996. All percentages
shown in this study are weighted to reflect
national estimates (see "Materials and
Methods" section). Smoking status was
identified at 11 792 visits and smoking
counseling was provided at 286 visits,
which represented 70.7% and 1.7% of all
visits, respectively. Patients were identi-
fied as smokers at 1005 visits, which rep-
resented 6.0% of all visits, and 8.5% of
visits where smoking status was identi-
fied. Smokers were identified at 0.8% of
all visits by 11­13 years of age (n 
4029), at 4.8% of visits by 14­17 years of
age (n  6384), and at 10.6% of visits by
18­21 years of age (n  6235). Smoking
counseling was provided at 168 of the vis-
its by smokers, representing 16.9% of the
visits by patients identified as smokers.
We caution that some of the estimates for
counseling at smokers' visits may be un-
reliable, as shown in Table 1, because the
relative standard errors are greater than
30% (see "Materials and Methods" sec-
tion). From 1991 through 1996, the pro-
portion of visits at which physicians iden-
tified smoking status decreased from
72.4% to 66.5% (adjusted P for trend
<.0001), but the proportion of visits where
physicians provided smoking counseling
or identified the patient as a smoker did
not change significantly (Fig. 1).
Table 1 shows factors independently
associated with identification of smoking
status, provision of smoking counseling at
all adolescent visits, and provision of
smoking counseling at visits by adoles-
cents identified as smokers. An adoles-
cent's age and race, but not sex, influ-
enced the frequency at which physicians
asked or counseled about smoking. As an
adolescent's age increased, physicians
were less likely to know the patient's
smoking status but more likely to counsel
about smoking. Physicians were more
likely to identify smoking status and to
discuss smoking with white than with
nonwhite adolescents. Physician specialty
and patient diagnosis also affected the
likelihood of smoking being addressed
during an office visit. Primary care phy-
sicians were more likely than specialists
to identify an adolescent's smoking status
and to discuss smoking. All physicians
were more likely to address smoking at
visits by patients with asthma, pregnancy,
or lower respiratory tract infections, and
an adolescent was almost five times more

likely to be counseled about smoking at a
general medical examination than at a
problem visit. Similar patterns occurred
for smoking counseling at visits by ado-
lescents known to be smokers, and the
associations with physician specialty,
general medical examination, pregnancy,
and lower respiratory tract infection were
statistically significant.
Fig. 2 shows in greater detail the vari-
ability in smoking treatment by physician
specialty--13.3% (n  2183) of all ado-
lescent visits were to pediatricians, 22.1%
(n  3626) were to family practitioners,
9.7% (n  1566) were to obstetrician/
gynecologists, 3.8% (n  622) were to
internists, and 51.1% (n  8651) were to
specialists. Pediatricians identified the
smoking status of adolescents at 81.7% of
all office visits, and the corresponding
rates for family practitioners, obstetrician/
gynecologists, and internists (75.3%­
76.4%) were not statistically significantly
different. Counseling adolescents about
smoking occurred at 3.5% of all office
visits to pediatricians, at 2.5% of all visits
to family practitioners, at 3.7% of all vis-
its to obstetrician/gynecologists, and at
1.7% of all visits to internists. Compared
with pediatricians, counseling occurred
significantly less often at adolescent visits
to family practitioners (P  .01 after ad-
justment with multiple logistic regres-
sion) and internists (P  .02 after adjust-
ment). Specialists identified smoking
status and counseled about smoking sta-
tistically significantly less than pediatri-
cians (adjusted P<.0001).
Fig. 3 shows the rates of smoking
counseling at the 10 most common pri-
mary diagnoses of adolescent smokers.
Smoking counseling occurred most fre-
quently (>20% of smokers' visits) at gen-
eral medical examinations and at visits for
acute respiratory tract infections and
pregnancy care and abortion, diagnoses
potentially complicated by smoking. Phy-
sicians were less likely to counsel smok-
ers at visits for diagnoses unrelated to
smoking, including acute minor injuries,
acne, or psychiatric diagnoses.

DISCUSSION
This study analyzed 6 years of data
from a nationally representative sample of
physicians to provide a longitudinal as-
sessment of how frequently physicians
addressed tobacco use with adolescents at
ambulatory visits and whether this
changed in the 1990s. We report that be-
tween 1991 and 1996 physicians fre-
quently identified an adolescent's smok-
ing status but rarely discussed smoking in
any further detail. Even when the patient
was known to be a smoker and the pur-
pose of the visit was a general medical
examination, smoking counseling oc-
curred only 34.6% of the time. The rate of
discussing smoking at a general medical
examination with any teen, regardless of
smoking status, was even lower (6.3%),
despite numerous recommendations to
discuss smoking at visits by all teens,
even those who do not smoke (7,9­
13,15). These rates did not improve be-
tween 1991 and 1996, despite clear con-
sensus among professional organizations
about the importance of addressing smok-
ing with teens and the development of
guidelines and health promotion goals on
the subject.
The factors that were related to wheth-
er smoking was addressed at an adoles-
cent's visit included a physician's spe-
cialty and a patient's age, race, and
diagnosis. Primary care physicians were
more likely to identify an adolescent's
smoking status and to counsel a teen
about smoking than were specialists. This
pattern also has been found among phy-
sicians treating adult patients (19). The
different types of primary care physicians
who see adolescent patients were equally
likely to identify a teen's smoking status
(Fig. 2, A), but pediatricians were more
likely than family practitioners and inter-
nists to counsel (Fig. 2, B). However, the
specialty differences were small, and all
types of physicians did little counseling.
An adolescent's diagnosis was also
strongly associated with the provision of
smoking counseling at an office visit. Pa-
tients with diagnoses potentially compli-
cated by smoking, such as asthma or preg-
nancy, were more likely to be counseled
about smoking than patients with other
diagnoses. This is consistent with another
study of adolescents (31) in which 20%­
30% of the patients with sickle cell dis-
ease or cystic fibrosis, chronic diseases
complicated by smoking, recalled being
counseled by their physician about to-
bacco use in the past year. A similar pat-

After adjustment for year, sex, age, race, diagnosis, type of visit, metropolitan statistical area, and insurance
status, all strata were compared with pediatric specialty (multiple logistic regression analysis two-sided P

tern has been reported for adults, although
some of the smoking-related diagnoses
were different (19). For adolescents, visits
for diagnoses not related to smoking are
important missed opportunities for coun-
seling to prevent tobacco use.
Nonwhite adolescents were less likely
than white teens to have their smoking
status identified and to be counseled
about smoking. This result is similar to
studies of adult smokers that have shown
that members of nonwhite racial/ethnic
groups are less likely than whites to re-
ceive advice on quitting from their physi-
cians (32). It is particularly concerning
because the prevalence of adolescent
smoking is rising faster among African-
American and Hispanic teens than among
white teens (3,32). Physicians counseled
patients aged 18­21 years about smoking
significantly more frequently than pa-
tients aged 11­13 years. This increase in
counseling with age is most likely attrib-
utable to the increasing prevalence of
smoking with age, since counseling at vis-
its by known smokers did not vary with
the age of the patient. It is especially im-
portant to address smoking with younger
adolescents because smoking initiation
rates increase rapidly after age 10 years
and peak at ages 13­14 years (33).
Our results should be considered in the
context of factors that have been shown to
be associated with physician counseling
of both adult and adolescent smokers.
These include previous physician training
in smoking counseling (16), physician in-
volvement in community tobacco control
efforts (16), and office reminder systems
to address tobacco use during a visit
(10,34,35). We were unable to include
these factors in our analysis, because the
NAMCS does not assess physician or of-
fice characteristics other than specialty
and region of practice. These factors may
partially explain the relationship between
physician specialty and smoking counsel-
ing that we observed. Alternatively, these
factors are potential confounders of this
observed relationship. Future studies
should collect data on all of these factors
to better determine predictors of physi-
cian counseling. Other factors, such as
physician beliefs about the lack of effi-
cacy of counseling adolescents about
smoking, may also explain the low rates
of counseling. Evidence of the efficacy of
physician counseling of adolescent pa-
tients is lacking, and future research to
establish this efficacy is needed.
The prevalence of adolescent smoking
detected by physicians in our study was
lower than the teen smoking prevalence
from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey
(YRBS), a survey in which adolescents
reported their smoking habits. According
to the YRBS, the prevalence of current
smoking (smoking one cigarette in the
past 30 days) among U.S. high school stu-
dents increased from 27.5% in 1991 to
36.4% in 1997 (1,3), and the prevalence
of frequent smoking (smoking on 20 or
more of the past 30 days) increased from
12.7% to 16.7% (1,3). In contrast, physi-
cians in our study identified smokers at
only 5% of the visits by 14- to 17-year-
old adolescents and at 11% of the visits
by 18- to 21-year-old adolescents. There
are several possible reasons why our data
may underestimate the prevalence of
smoking among adolescents visiting the
physician. First, it is possible that adoles-
cent smokers visit physicians less fre-
quently than nonsmokers. Second, adoles-
cents seeing a doctor may not have been
truthful about smoking because they did
not want to be reprimanded for their be-
havior or they were concerned about con-
fidentiality. Finally, many of the physi-
cians and patients may have defined a
"smoker" to be an adolescent who smokes
on a daily basis (3). For these reasons, it is
essential that physicians counsel all ado-
lescents about smoking, even if the ado-
lescent identifies himself or herself as a
nonsmoker.
There are some limitations to our
analysis. First, the NAMCS is a visit-
based survey and, therefore, our estimates
reflect only the probability of being coun-
seled at a visit and not the probability of
an individual patient being counseled
over a given period, such as 1 year. Pa-
tients who visit physicians frequently
might be less likely to be counseled about
smoking at an individual visit but more
likely to be counseled over 1 year. How-
ever, the visit-based nature of the survey
is not a limitation for assessing the iden-
tification of smoking status because cur-
rent guidelines advise physicians to ask
about smoking at every visit. Second,
physicians may have interpreted the defi-
nition of smoking counseling differently.
For the years 1991 through 1994, the
counseling check box on the survey was
labeled as "smoking cessation," while for
the years 1995 through 1996, the box was
labeled "tobacco use/exposure." It might
be expected that "tobacco use/exposure"
would be interpreted more broadly and
bias the rate of counseling upward for
those years. However, the rates of smok-
ing counseling did not rise with the
change in labels, and it is unlikely that
this change substantially affected our es-
timates of counseling. Finally, the
NAMCS might underestimate the amount
of counseling provided by physicians be-
cause the survey is completed after the
patient visit. However, a recent direct ob-
servation study of family physicians dem-
onstrated that the rate of providing coun-
seling to adult smokers was 25% (36),
which was similar to the rate of counsel-
ing by physicians in an analysis of
NAMCS for patients 18 years of age or
older (19).
In conclusion, it is clear that physi-
cians are not adequately addressing smok-
ing among their adolescent patients. De-
spite the national public health and public
policy emphasis on preventing smoking
among teens, physicians are doing even
less smoking counseling among adoles-
cents than among adults (19). Further-
more, we find no evidence that the initial
efforts to encourage physician involve-
ment by disseminating guidelines about
addressing teen smoking have influenced
physician practices. If the medical com-
munity is to play its part in the national
effort to reduce smoking among teens,
more intensive interventions to change
physician behavior are necessary. These
interventions should include 1) training
programs for residents and practicing
physicians treating adolescents, 2)
changes in office practice and information
systems to encourage physicians to ad-
dress smoking, 3) adequate reimburse-
ment to physicians for counseling adoles-
cents about tobacco use, and 4) the
inclusion of smoking status identification
and counseling about tobacco use as qual-
ity indicators for the treatment of adoles-
cent patients (10,37). Future research
about counseling adolescents should ad-
dress which of these interventions are
most effective. Physicians and other
health care professionals who care for
adolescents should take better advantage
of their opportunity to discourage smok-
ing among their adolescent patients.
