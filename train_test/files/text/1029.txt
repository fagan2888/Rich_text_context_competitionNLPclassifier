OBJECTIVE -- To describe the extent of adoption of diabetes care management processes in
physician organizations in the U.S. and to investigate the organizational factors that affect the
adoption of diabetes care management processes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Data are derived from the National Survey of
Physician Organizations and the Management of Chronic Illness, conducted in 2000­2001. A
total of 1,104 of the 1,590 physician organizations identified responded to the survey. The extent
of adoption of four diabetes care management processes is measured by an index consisting of
the organization's use of diabetic patient registries, clinical practice guidelines, case manage-
ment, and physician feedback. The ordinary least-squares model is used to determine the
association of organizational characteristics with the adoption of diabetes care management
processes in physician organizations. A logistic regression model is used to determine the asso-
ciation of organizational characteristics with the adoption of individual diabetes care manage-
ment processes.
RESULTS -- Of the 987 physician organizations studied that treat patients with diabetes, 48%
either do not use any or use only one of the four diabetes care management processes. A total of
20% use two care management processes, and 32% use three or four processes. External incen-
tives to improve quality, computerized clinical information systems, and ownership by hospitals
or health maintenance organizations are strongly associated with the diabetes care management
index and the adoption of individual diabetes care management processes.
CONCLUSIONS -- Policies to encourage external incentives to improve quality and to
facilitate the adoption of computerized clinical information technology may promote greater use
of diabetes care management processes.

Alarge body of evidence suggests
that diabetes is inadequately man-
aged in the U.S. In a 1999­2000
randomly sampled survey of 488 adults
with diabetes living in 12 metropolitan
areas in the U.S., followed by a review of
many of their medical charts, only 45% of
recommended processes of diabetes care
were delivered. Only 24% of adults with
diabetes underwent three or more HbA1c
tests over a 2-year period (1).
Data from the 1999­2000 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) show that 37% of patients
with diabetes achieved the target goal of
HbA1c
level 7.0% and 37% had HbA1c
levels 8.0%, percentages that did not
change significantly from a similar 1988­
1994 national survey. A total of 36% of
patients with diabetes had normal blood
pressure (130/80 mmHg), whereas
40% had elevated blood pressure
(140/90 mmHg). Of the study subjects,
52% had total cholesterol levels 200
mg/dl. Only 7% of adults with diabetes in
1999­2000 attained recommended goals
of HbA1c
, blood pressure, and total cho-
lesterol (2).
The locus of actual care delivery for
much of diabetes management is the phy-
sician organization. No large-scale sur-
veys have previously been conducted to
determine the extent to which physician
organizations have adopted innovations
known to improve the care of diabetes. It
is also not known which organizational
and market characteristics are associated
with implementation of diabetes care im-
provements. This study presents data
from the first major physician organiza-
tion survey ever conducted in the U.S. to
address these two questions. The Na-
tional Study of Physician Organizations
and the Management of Chronic Illness
(NSPO) was a national telephone survey
of medical groups and independent prac-
tice associations (IPAs) with 20 or more
physicians (3). The NSPO collected data
that can determine the prevalence of dia-
betes care improvements and can explore
which characteristics of physician organi-
zations associate with their greater adop-
tion. To address deficiencies in the
management of diabetes and other
chronic conditions, Wagner et al. (4) de-
veloped the Chronic Care Model (5,6).
The Chronic Care Model includes six
components, two (health care organiza-
tion and community resources) that in-

volve the larger health care system
surrounding the physician organization
and four internal components (decision
support, delivery system redesign, clini-
cal information systems, and self-
management support) that take place
within the physician organization.
The NSPO gathered data from physi-
cian organizations on four care manage-
ment processes (CMPs) derived from the
internal Chronic Care Model compo-
nents. These four CMPs are 1) use of clin-
ical practice guidelines in conjunction
with physician reminder systems (deci-
sion support and clinical information sys-
tems), 2) case management (delivery
system redesign), 3) performance feed-
back to individual physicians (clinical in-
formation systems), and 4) disease
registries (clinical information systems).
These four CMPs were chosen because a
number of studies have demonstrated
that they improve clinical outcomes for
patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis
and a Cochrane review found that re-
minder systems (placing practice guide-
lines at the point of care) improved
diabetes control (7,8). Compared with
control subjects, those undergoing case
management, in planned nurse-run dia-
betes clinics or by telephone, had im-
proved glycemic control in several studies
(9­12). Pooled data from three studies
showed that performance feedback to
physicians was associated with a slight
improvement in diabetes control (8). Di-
abetes registries, if used to bring patients
at risk into care, have been shown in a
Mayo Clinic study to reduce HbA1c
levels
compared with control groups (13). Par-
ticularly for diabetes, the introduction of
several of these care management inter-
ventions is more effective than the use of
only one intervention (6,14,15). The sur-
vey asked physician organizations about
their use of patient self-management pro-
grams (3), but not in specific relation to
diabetes; therefore, data about this CMP
are not reported here.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The NSPO was con-
ducted from September 2000 to Septem-
ber 2001 (3). A medical group was
defined as an organization composed of
physicians belonging to one practice, op-
erating in either one office or at many lo-
cations. An IPA was defined as an
organization through which physicians
contract with managed care plans and in
which physicians work solo or in small
practices that are independent of each
other.
A number of strategies were used to
increase the response rate, including
making up to 25 phone calls to the phy-
sician organization. In addition, informa-
tion about support for the project from
various professional groups and leaders
were faxed or mailed to certain groups.
Participants were paid $150 and sent a
summary feedback report to use for
benchmarking with other physician orga-
nizations around the country.
Population studied
Of the 1,590 physician organizations
identified, 1,104 (69.6%) responded to
the telephone survey. Information on
nonrespondents is limited. Nonrespon-
dents did not differ from respondents by
size or by state, but IPAs had a signifi-
cantly higher response rate than medical
groups (79 and 66%, respectively) (3). Of
these 1,104 respondents, we excluded
117 organizations stating that they did
not treat patients with diabetes, leaving
987 physician organizations included in
our study. Among these were 645 medical
groups and 342 IPAs. The NSPO was de-
signed to measure the organizational
characteristics and extent of adoption of
CMPs for physician organizations with at
least 20 physicians. A number of ques-
tions in the survey attempted to deter-
mine the use of these CMPs for the care of
patients with diabetes. Further informa-
tion about the development, administra-
tion, and content of the survey is available
from other sources (3,16).
Dependent variable
To assess physician organizations' use of
diabetes CMPs, the survey asked whether
the organization had implemented the
four diabetes CMPs discussed above: clin-
ical practice guidelines in conjunction
with physician reminder systems, case
management, performance feedback to
individual physicians, and disease regis-
tries. All four diabetes CMPs are signifi-
cantly correlated with each other (P 
0.001). We created a diabetes care man-
agement index using these four diabetes
CMPs to measure the extent of adoption
of diabetes CMPs in each physician orga-
nization. The index range is 0­4; an or-
ganization received one point for each of
the four CMPs adopted. The internal con-
sistency reliability (Cronbach ) of the di-
abetes care management index was 0.64.
Independent variables
We used four groups of independent vari-
ables: external incentives for a physician
organization to improve quality, comput-
erized clinical information technology in-
frastructure, relationship with health
maintenance organizations (HMOs), and
ownership of the physician organizations.
To assess external incentives, the sur-
vey asked seven questions: whether the
physician organization received addi-
tional income from health plans for scor-
ing well on quality measures; whether the
physician organization got public recog-
nition for quality; whether it received bet-
ter contracts from health plans for quality;
and whether physician organizations
were required to report Health Plan Em-
ployer Data and Information Set (HEDIS)
data, outcomes data, results of quality
projects, or patient satisfaction data to an
outside organization. The first three of the
external incentive questions were defined
as categorical variables, coded as 1 or 0.
For the last four questions, we created a
composite measure with the organization
receiving one point for each kind of re-
porting to an outside organization. The
range of this composite measure is 0­4.
Altogether, we had four independent
variables for the external incentives.
Clinical information technology was
measured by a single clinical information
technology (IT) index. The components
of this index included whether the physi-
cian organization had a computerized
problem list, physician progress notes, list
of medications prescribed, medication or-
dering reminders and/or drug interaction
information, laboratory results, and radi-
ology results. We assigned one score for
each of the six IT components; the result-
ing index measure ranges from 0 to 6.
The relationship of a physician orga-
nization with HMOs was assessed by two
measures: the percentage of revenue from
capitation and the percentage of risk del-
egation to the physician organization for
hospital admission of HMO and point-of-
services patients.
Ownership of physician organiza-
tions was categorized as ownership by an
HMO or hospital system, ownership by
physicians in the organization, or owner-
ship by nonphysician managers and
others.

Control variables
Control variables included the type of
physician organization (medical group or
IPA), the practice type (primary care only,
specialty care only, or multispecialty
group with both primary and specialty
care), organization age, size of the organi-
zation, and the degree of HMO penetra-
tion at the county level.
Model specification
We used a multivariate ordinary least-
squares regression model to predict the
effects of organizational characteristics on
the extent of adoption of diabetes CMP in
physician organizations. We also used a
logistic model to explore each of the four
CMPs separately because the answers for
adoption of individual diabetes CMPs are
categorical yes/no variables.
RESULTS -- The descriptive statistics
on the extent of adoption of diabetes
CMPs in physician organizations are re-
ported in Table 1. Of the 987 medical
groups and IPAs surveyed that treat pa-
tients with diabetes, the average score on
the diabetes care management index was
1.7. In other words, physician organiza-
tions on average used fewer than two of
the four components of the diabetes care
management index. A total of 26% of
physician organizations used none of the
four diabetes care management processes,
22% used only one process, 20% used
two processes, 19% used three processes,
and 13% used all four processes. Physi-
cian performance feedback was the most
commonly reported CMP for diabetes,
used by 48% of physician organizations,
followed by 43% using diabetes case
managers, 40% having a diabetes registry,
and 39% using physician guidelines and
tied to reminder systems (Table 2). Inter-
estingly, the physician organizations that
used more of the diabetes CMP also used
more CMP for congestive heart failure,
asthma, and depression.
Table 3 shows the results of the ordi-
nary least-squares regression for factors
affecting adoption of diabetes CMPs. All
four external incentives to improve qual-
ity are strongly associated with a physi-
cian organization's use of diabetes CMPs.
Requiring physician organizations to re-
port HEDIS and other quality data to out-
side organizations is strongly associated
with increasing the diabetes care manage-
ment index score. Reporting one addi-
tional kind of quality data to an outside
organization is associated with increasing
the diabetes care management index score
by 0.18, an 11% increase from the 1.7
average diabetes care management index
score (P  0.001). Organizations report-
ing all four kinds of quality data to an
outside organization use 2.2 diabetes
CMPs, whereas physician organizations
that did not report quality data to an out-
side organization use only 1.5 diabetes
CMPs on average. Compared with physi-
cian organizations that did not receive the
indicated incentive for quality, physician
organizations that received outside in-
come for quality improvement use 0.20
more diabetes CMPs (12% increase from
the mean, P  0.05). Physician organiza-
tions that received public recognition for
scoring well on quality-of-care measures
use 0.35 more diabetes CMPs (21% in-
crease from the mean, P  0.001), and
physician organizations that received bet-

ter contracts for quality use 0.23 more di-
abetes CMPs (14% increase from the
mean, P  0.05).
IT infrastructure is also significantly
related to adoption of diabetes care man-
agement. A one-point increase in the IT
index is associated with an increase of
0.11 (6% increase from the mean, P 
0.001) in the diabetes care management
index. That is, organizations that score 0
on the clinical IT index use only 1.5 dia-
betes CMPs, whereas an organization that
scores 6 on the IT index uses 2.2 diabetes
CMPs.
Among the variables that assess the
relationship between physician organiza-
tions and health plans, the percentage of
revenue from capitation has a very small
positive influence of 0.002 on the diabe-
tes care management index (P  0.05). In
other words, a physician organization
that is fully capitated uses 0.3 more dia-
betes CMPs than a physician organization
that is reimbursed only on a fee-for-
service basis. The percentage of delega-
tion of utilization management for
hospital admissions to the physician or-
ganization also has a small effect of 0.005
(P  0.001). Increasing the delegation
from 0 to 100% in an organization in-
creases the number of diabetes CMPs
by 0.5.
Physician organizations owned by
HMOs or hospital systems score 0.22
higher on the diabetes care management
index than those owned by physicians, a
13% increase from the average index
score (P  0.01).
Among control variables, only size is
positively correlated with more diabetes
CMPs (P  0.01), but the effect is very
small (only 0.0003). Medical groups use
more diabetes CMPs than IPAs, but the
difference is not significant.
We also explored each of the four
CMPs separately, using logistic regression
models, because the answers for adoption
of individual diabetes CMPs are categori-
cal yes/no variables. The results of the lo-
gistic regressions of use of individual
diabetes CMPs are similar to the results
for the overall diabetes care management
index and are not presented.
CONCLUSIONS -- Our study is the
first to provide national data on the use of
diabetes CMPs among physician organi-
zations. Our results demonstrate that ex-
ternal incentives for quality, clinical IT
capability, and group ownership by an
HMO or hospital system are associated
with increased use of diabetes CMPs.
On average, physician organizations
have adopted fewer than two of the four
components of the diabetes care manage-
ment index. More than 25% of the physi-
cian organizations studied that treat
patients with diabetes do not use any di-
abetes CMPs at all, and an additional 22%
use only one of these CMPs. This is un-
fortunate, because the CMPs have been
shown, in most studies, to be associated
with improved diabetes outcomes (7­
13,15). These findings are consistent with
the conclusion of the report Crossing the
Quality Chasm by the Institute of Medi-
cine (IOM) (17), in that the gap between
scientific knowledge and routine practice
in diabetes treatment remains large. The
IOM report also argued that low quality is
primarily the result of a failure at the or-
ganizational level rather than that of indi-
vidual physicians. The IOM proposed the
implementation of organizational pro-
cesses for quality and emphasized the im-
portance of providing physician
organizations with incentives for quality-
enhancing processes.
Our regression results support the
conclusions of the IOM report. They dem-
onstrate that incentives for physician
organizations to improve quality are asso-
ciated with greater adoption of diabetes
CMPs. Physician organizations being re-
quired to report on quality to outside or-
ganizations, receiving income, gaining
public recognition for high quality care, or
getting better contracts for quality are
more likely to adopt diabetes CMPs.
These incentives result in 11, 12, 21, and
14% increases, respectively, in the use of
diabetes CMPs in physician organiza-
tions.
Our findings also support the role
played by clinical IT infrastructure. IT fa-
cilitates better chronic illness care by giv-
ing physicians access to patient
information, enabling identification of at-
risk populations, and providing decision
support at the point of care. Without IT
infrastructure, it is difficult to generate a
registry of diabetic patients and to provide
tools for patient tracking and follow-up.
Despite these benefits, few physician orga-

nizations studied had robust IT capabili-
ties. Using an IT index with a range from
0 to 6, the mean IT index score for physi-
cian organizations surveyed is only 1.33.
Resources and tools to create greater IT
infrastructure in physician organizations
may stimulate increased adoption of dia-
betes CMPs.
We also found that physician organi-
zations owned by HMOs or hospital sys-
tems used more diabetes CMPs than
physician-owned physician organiza-
tions. This result may be explained by the
fact that HMO- and hospital-owned phy-
sician organizations have more resources
available to implement CMPs.
Our study has several limitations.
First, the study relied on physician orga-
nization leaders (almost always the med-
ical directors or president) to report on
the adoption of diabetes CMPs. There
may have been a tendency to overreport
the adoption of CMPs, in which case the
actual extent of use of these CMPs may be
lower than what we have reported. Sec-
ond, we asked organizations yes/no ques-
tions regarding use of a particular CMP.
We have no information on how many
patients are affected by a CMP, or the clin-
ical outcomes associated with the use of
that process. Third, the cross-sectional
nature of the data leads to an inability to
draw conclusions about cause and effect.
For example, if a physician organization
could get better contracts for quality, it
may be more likely to implement CMPs in
the organization. On the other hand, it is
also likely that a physician organization
that has implemented CMPs is more likely
to obtain better contracts that include in-
centive bonuses for quality. A fourth lim-
itation is that the NSPO only surveyed
organizations of 20 or more physicians.
We have no information on organizations
with fewer than 20 physicians.
CMPs--the institution of physician
reminder systems based on clinical prac-
tice guidelines, case management, perfor-
mance feedback to individual physicians,
and use of disease registries--have been
associated with improved glycemic con-
trol in patients with diabetes.
The survey reported here demon-
strates that few medium- and large-sized
physician organizations have adopted all
these processes and that 48% of these
physician organizations have instituted
none or only one of these processes. This
study identifies some factors that seem to
increase the likelihood of physician orga-
nizations adopting CMPs for diabetes.
Some of these factors are external quality
reporting, additional payment for better
quality, sophisticated clinical information
systems, organizational size, and owner-
ship of the physician organization by an
HMO or hospital system. Policies and
practices that promote these characteris-
tics may help spread improvement in di-
abetes care.
