Estimated Prevalence of People With
Cognitive Impairment: Results From
Nationally Representative Community
and Institutional Surveys
Amy B. Bernstein, ScD,1 and Robin E. Remsburg, PhD, APRN, BC1
Purpose: We address how the national prevalence of
cognitive impairment can be estimated from two nation-
ally representative surveys. Design and Methods:
Data are from the 1999足2001 National Health Inter-
view Survey (NHIS) and the 1999 National Nursing
Home Survey (NNHS). The NHIS represents all
community-dwelling people living in the United
States, and the NNHS is representative of all nursing
home residents. Results: NHIS data show that there
are approximately 800,000 community-based elders
aged 65 and older with reported confusion or mem-
ory loss, and 2.3 million elders with reported
limitation of activity caused by senility or dementia.
There are an estimated 632,000 nursing home res-
idents aged 65 and older with a reported diagnosis
of dementia. Implications: Estimates of the preva-
lence of cognitive impairment that are based on
nationally representative data are rare, because
comprehensively evaluating a national sample by
using standard, validated cognitive-impairment as-
sessment methods is difficult and expensive, and
because most national surveys are broad based and
designed to cover a wide variety of topics. Crude
measures of cognitive impairment, such as the pres-
ence of confusion or memory loss or limitations
caused by senility or dementia, that are included in
these multipurpose surveys may be only rough proxies
for clinically evaluated cognitive impairment, but they
do appear to produce prevalence estimates that are
similar to estimates found with the use of more precise
case-ascertainment methods. These nationally repre-
sentative data sets may be used to generate hypoth-
eses related to the prevalence, epidemiology, and
health care utilization patterns of people with cog-
nitive impairment that can be tested in studies using
more specific case-ascertainment criteria.

Cognitive impairment is often, although not al-
ways, a precursor to dementia later in life (Leifer,
2003; Panza et al., 2005; Richie & Touchon, 2000).
An accurate estimate of the number of people with
identifiable cognitive impairment, along with their
health status, comorbid conditions, and use of health
care services, can provide a baseline for forecasting
the health care and social resources needed to care
for people with this increasingly common condition.
Dementia can be difficult to diagnose, particularly
in its early stages. This imprecision in diagnosis
translates into difficulty in identifying individuals
with clinical dementia in either person-based surveys
or in surveys that rely on medical or administrative
records. Cognitive impairment, however, is more of
a symptom than a diagnosis, and it can be determined
by respondent report or clinical observation. Our
analysis addresses how the prevalence of cognitive
impairment can be estimated from two national
health surveys, the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS), which was designed to track the overall
health status and determinants of health status and
health care of the civilian noninstitutionalized pop-
ulation, and the National Nursing Home Survey
(NNHS) resident sample, which was designed to
track changes in nursing home use, characteristics of
nursing home residents, and nursing home facility

characteristics. This is one of a very few studies that
includes people with cognitive impairment in both
institutional and community-based nationally repre-
sentative data sets and compares results based on
different case-ascertainment methods. Although the
method of identification of patients with cognitive
impairment differs between the surveys, when the
surveys are taken together, they provide a more
comprehensive picture of the total prevalence of
cognitive impairment than each survey does on its
own. More often, researchers derive prevalence
estimates of cognitive impairment from small studies
in which investigators screen people by using various
assessment scales that assess various domains of
cognition (e.g., memory, problem solving, wording
finding), and then apply the prevalence estimates from
screened respondents to population data. This raises
questions about the generalizability of the popula-
tions screened (Government Accountability Office
[GAO], 1999; Suthers, Kim, & Crimmins, 2003).
Design and Methods
Data
Data for this analysis come from two nationally
representative surveys: the NHIS and the NNHS,
resident sample, sponsored by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's National Center
for Health Statistics. Because elderly people com-
prise the large majority of patients with cognitive
impairment and diagnosed dementia, we include
only those people aged 65 and older in this analysis.
The NHIS monitors the health of the U.S.
population through the collection and analysis of
data on a broad range of health topics. The NHIS is
a continuous survey of the civilian, noninstitution-
alized population of the United States. It obtains
information through in-person interviews with
household respondents and one selected adult and
one child per household. Since 1997, the sample has
included about 100,000 people per year. In order to
have a sufficiently robust sample size for people with
a limitation caused by dementia, we combined data
from 3 separate years (1999足2001) for this analysis.
The 1999足2001 NHIS included 33,134 people aged 65
or older in the family component of the survey and
18,331 people aged 65 and older in the sample adult
component.
The NNHS is a series of national probability
sample surveys of nursing homes, their residents, and
their staff. Data from the 1999 NNHS provide point-
in-time estimates of residents from a sample of
people currently residing in nursing homes. A staff
member familiar with the sampled residents, re-
ferring to medical and facility records, provided
resident data through on-site interviews. The 1999
sample consisted of 1,496 nursing homes and 8,215
current residents (7,383 individuals who were aged
65 and older).
Identification of Cases
Table 1 displays how we identify people in the
two surveys as having cognitive impairment. We
derive two measures of cognitive impairment from
the limitation-of-activity component of the family
core questionnaire of the community-based NHIS
(see Table 1).
The full set of limitation of activity questions
elicits whether anyone in the household has a limi-
tation in his or her everyday activities as a result of
a physical, mental, or emotional health problem.
The responses may be self-reported or reported by
proxy from an adult household member for other
household members not present at the interview.
Respondents are asked about limitations in activities
of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living,
play, school, and work; difficulties in walking or in
remembering; and any other activity limitations. The
first NHIS measure assessed the self-report of
limitations caused by confusion or memory loss.
The second measure of cognitive impairment used
for NHIS participants is based on the specific con-
dition or disease that causes activity limitations
identified by any of the aforementioned limitation-
of-activity questions. When limitations are reported,
the causal health conditions are determined and
respondents are considered limited if one or more of
these conditions is chronic. Interviewers asked only
the subset of NHIS respondents who identified a
limitation of activity to identify the cause or condi-
tion that caused the limitation. Interviewers then
asked respondents what condition caused each limi-
tation identified and recorded this condition as
``senility'' if the respondent reported that the limi-
tation was due to senility, Alzheimer's disease, or
another aging-related cognitive impairment. People
with a ``yes'' response to this question are included in
the Senility cognitive-impairment category.
The respondent-reported confusion or memory
loss-measure casts a wide net and is probably an
overestimate of the total prevalence of people who
would be diagnosed with dementia if they were
clinically assessed. Conversely, the number of people
who report a limitation caused by senility is prob-
ably an underestimate of the total number of
community-dwelling elderly persons who could be
diagnosed with dementia if they were assessed by
a clinician, because it excludes many people in the
early stages of dementia who do not yet have
a reported dementia-related limitation of activity.
Among older people with a limitation caused by
senility (NHIS Measure 2), 87% also reported
a limitation caused by confusion or memory loss,
and approximately 30% of the people who reported
confusion or memory loss (NHIS Measure 1) also
reported a limitation caused by senility.
We considered cognitive impairment or dementia
to be present in persons in the NNHS on the basis of
whether they had a diagnosis of dementia recorded on
Vol. 47, No. 3, 2007 351
the medical record or reported to the NNHS inter-
viewer by a knowledgeable staff person. Up to six
conditions could be recorded for nursing home res-
idents; which were coded to the appropriate ICD-9-
CM diagnostic dementia codes (i.e., those listed by the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases,
ninth revision, clinical modification; see Table 1).
All differences noted in this paper are statistically
significant at the p , .05 level and are tested by use
of the two-tailed z test. We computed estimates of
standard errors by using SUDAAN software, which
takes into account the complex survey designs of
both the NHIS and the NHHS (more detail about
all of the NCHS surveys, including downloadable
publications, can be found on the NCHS website at
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs).
Results
Using the NHIS Confusion or Memory loss- mea-
sure of cognitive impairment, we found that, on aver-
age, approximately 2.3 million community-dwelling
people aged 65 and older had cognitive impairment
at the time of the survey during the 3-year period
between 1999 and 2001 period (Table 2). Using the
Senility measure, however, we found that the esti-
mated number of community-dwelling elderly people
with cognitive impairment was only 800,000 people.
Although only 4% of noninstitutionalized people
aged 65 to 74 years had confusion or memory loss,
this increased to 9% for people aged 75 to 84 years
and to almost 20% of people aged 85 and older. Less
than 1% of noninstitutionalized people aged 65 to 74
years reported a limitation caused by senility,
compared with 9% of people aged 85 and older.
About 623,000 nursing home residents aged 65
and older had a dementia diagnosis at the time of the
survey in 1999. For nursing home residents, the
prevalence of diagnosed dementia was similar to that
for people aged 75 to 84 and people aged 85 and
older (approximately 43% to 45%), but this rate was
considerably higher than the rate for people aged 65
to 74 (approximately 30%).
Discussion
This analysis shows that it is possible to make esti-
mates of cognitive impairment from general-purpose
health surveys that do not specifically set out to assess
cognitive impairment. It also shows that these

estimates are consistent with other studies that focus
more specifically on measuring clinical dementia
prevalence in small, nonnationally representative
studies (e.g., Brookmeyer, Gray, & Kawas, 1998;
GAO, 1998; Hendrie, 1998; Herbert, Scherr, Bienias,
Bennett, & Evans, 2003; Kukull et al., 2002;
Magaziner et al., 2000). For example, a meta-analysis
produced by the GAO estimated that approximately
5.7% of the people aged 65 years had any Alzheimer's
disease dementia--not including other types of
dementia--in 1995, and 3.3% had moderate or severe
Alzheimer's disease (GAO). In a study using nation-
ally representative data, Suthers and colleagues found
a cognitive-impairment prevalence rate of 5.5% to
6.5% for people aged 70 and older who were living in
the community and a rate of approximately 50%
among institutionalized elders aged 70 and older
(Suthers et al., 2003). These researchers used two out
of seven symptoms related to cognitive impairment as
their classification criteria, which is considerably
more stringent than the single question or item that
we used for the three measures of cognitive impair-
ment presented in this analysis.
Our study is subject to several limitations. Surveil-
lance for cognitive impairment typically uses assess-
ment scales that assess various domains of cognition
(e.g., memory, problem solving, and word finding; see
Rosenberg, Johnston, & Lyketsos, 2006); therefore,
the use of a single item is a crude or imprecise method
to ascertain cognitive impairment. Second, people
with cognitive impairment in the NHIS are classified
on the basis of self-report or proxy report, and
prevalence may be underreported because of possible
stigma or embarrassment. Cognitive impairment in
the nursing home sample is determined by staff
members who refer to sampled residents' medical
records, and this too is subject to misreporting or
underreporting. Cognitive impairment is a complex
condition, and researchers cannot make a definitive
determination of it on the basis of one question about
cognition or limitation of activity. Further analyses
comparing results from these questions with other
validated measures would have to be conducted.
Without further validation, results using the NHIS
measures would have to be interpreted with caution
and replicated with additional studies. Our analysis
also does not include any data on cognitive impair-
ment within the small (but increasing) number of
people living in alternative long-term-care residential
settings, such as assisted living facilities, who are not
included in either household surveys of noninstitu-
tionalized persons (such as the NHIS) or surveys of
persons in institutional settings (such as the NNHS).
However, the fact that results based on these simple
measures are consistent with other studies using more
detailed measures means that researchers may be able
to use these national studies to generate hypotheses
related to the prevalence and determinants of
cognitive impairment, comorbid conditions, or health
care utilization of people with cognitive impairment
that can be tested in studies with more specific
cognitive-impairment case-ascertainment criteria. It
is our hope that the NHIS and the NNHS, which
include these indicators of cognitive impairment but
