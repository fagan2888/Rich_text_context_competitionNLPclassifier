SUMMARY
Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of
metabolic syndrome, is the most common cause of primary liver disease.
Although recent studies have found that coffee drinking is protective
against end stage chronic liver disease, there are scarce caffeine intake data
in NAFLD specifically.
Aim
To investigate the effects of dietary behaviour in NAFLD patients, using
four continuous cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES 2001­2008).
Methods
Using data from four continuous cycles of NHANES, dietary intake ques-
tionnaires that list 62 nutrition components. Logistic regression was used to
identify independent predictors of NAFLD among nutrition components
after adjustment for potential clinical confounders. All analyses were run
using SAS 9.1 and SUDAAN 10.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Of the 62 nutrient components used for the univariate analysis, 38% were
significant (P-value <0.05) in NAFLD with caffeine consumption being
higher in the control group (P-value <0.001). The multivariate analysis
using demographics, clinical parameters and nutritional components found
five factors independently associated with NAFLD [African American Race
P-value <0.001); Male gender P-value <0.001); Obesity (BMI  30) P-value
<0.001); Caffeine intake (mg) P-value <0.001) and total plain water con-
sumption (g) P-value £0.02)].
Conclusions
Our analysis shows that caffeine intake is independently associated with a
lower risk for NAFLD suggesting a potential protective effect. These data
necessitate further research to elucidate the mechanism by which caffeine
can protect against NAFLD.

INTRODUCTION
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is currently one of the
most common causes of elevated liver enzymes and
chronic liver disease in the Western world.1­5 Attributed
to the rapidly increasing rate of obesity, along with other
components of metabolic syndrome, such as Type II dia-
betes, the prevalence of NAFLD is growing at an alarm-
ing rate in both adults and children.5­7 In the United
States, it is estimated that 25­30% of the population is
afflicted with NAFLD, 2­3% have NASH and of these,
10­15% develop cirrhosis.8­12
The general consensus is that obesity in the United
States population is an important contributing factor in
the increased incidence of NAFLD.4, 5 According to the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) conducted between 2007 and 2008, the prev-
alence of obesity in adults reached 32.2% among men
and 35.5% among women.13 Based on projected obesity
rates, it is predicted that by the year 2025, 45­50% of
the adult population will be obese, resulting in NAFLD
related liver disease in over 25 million Americans.14
Despite the well established link between NAFLD and
BMI,15 obese and overweight people are not the only
ones who are at risk of developing NAFLD and NASH.16
The propensity of NAFLD to be a progressive disease
suggests that early interventions could potentially prevent
the more serious latter stage manifestations of this dis-
ease. These observations indicate that the development of
NAFLD is indeed multi-factorial and other factors, such
as dietary habits may play an important role in the
development of NAFLD.
Although a number of nutritional studies have been
performed to assess the interaction between diet and
liver disease, caffeine intake has garnered a lot of atten-
tion. Studies done in the United States have shown that
increased coffee intake is associated with a lower inci-
dence of abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activ-
ity.17 In addition, studies from Europe and Japan have
indicated an inverse relationship between coffee and lev-
els of g-glutamyltransferase and aminotransferases in
serum.18­24
Assessing end stage liver-specific outcomes, a large
population based study in Norway found an inverse
association between coffee consumption and liver cirrho-
sis.25 Furthermore, a study using the first National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1971­1975)
found that coffee and tea drinking decreases the risk of
clinically significant chronic liver disease as defined by
death or hospitalisation due to CLD.17 Caffeine has also
been implicated in hepatic fibrosis, as recently demon-
strated by a study showing that regular coffee consump-
tion, above a threshold of approximately two coffee-cup
equivalents per day, was associated with less severe hepa-
tic fibrosis.26 Recent studies have also suggested that cof-
fee consumption may reduce the risk of developing
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk popula-
tions.27 In addition, research in the field of hepatitis C
and treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin found
that high-level consumption of coffee (more than three
cups per day) to be an independent predictor of
improved virological response.28 Despite the increasing
focus on the effects of coffee in the aetiology of severe
liver disease, there is little data assessing the relationship
between coffee consumption and NAFLD specifically.
Using recent U.S. population data, the aim of this
study is to investigate the effects of dietary behaviour,
specifically the nutrition components measured for
NHANES participants, on the prevalence of NAFLD.
METHODS
Study population
The data for the study were obtained from four continu-
ous cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Surveys (NHANES) conducted between 2001 and
2008. The survey data were collected by the U.S.
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) via
household interviews, physical examination and labora-
tory tests. The survey cycles included into the study con-
sisted of similar questionnaires and data collection
methods. Demographic, clinical and laboratory parame-
ters were transformed according to the provided guide-
lines to make the data comparable between the cycles.29
Inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this study
were similar to previously published reports.4, 5 Further-
more definitions for obesity (BMI 30), Hypertension,
hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes mellitus were similar
to previously reported.4, 5 Finally, insulin resistance was
defined as a homeostasis of model assessment score30 or
HOMA) >3.0, elevated serum aminotransferases were
defined as ALT >40 U/L or AST >37 U/L in men and
ALT or AST >31 U/L in women and elevated transferrin
saturation was determined as 50% or higher.4, 5
We also divided participants to four major race or
ethnic groups: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic
blacks, Hispanics, and `other,' which included Aleut,
Eskimo, American Indian, Asian or Pacific Islander.
In terms of tobacco and alcohol consumption, a posi-
tive smoking history was defined as on-going smoking or

more than 100 cigarettes in the past 5 years.4, 5 Alcohol
intake was calculated according to self-reported data on
the amount and frequency of alcohol consumption col-
lected as a part of the Alcohol Use questionnaires.4, 5
Excessive alcohol consumption was defined as >20 g/day
for men and >10 g/day for women.
We used previously described definition for
NAFLD.2, 4, 5, 31, 32 Specifically, in this study, NAFLD
was defined as elevated serum aminotransferases without
any indication of other causes of chronic liver disease
such as viral hepatitis infection (defined as positive HCV
RNA or HBsAg test), iron overload (transferrin satura-
tion of 50% or higher) or excessive alcohol consumption
as defined above. Similarly, controls were defined as par-
ticipants without any evidence of chronic liver disease
and normal liver enzymes.
Nutrition data
The dietary intake data collected as a part of the Dietary
Recall Interview are used to estimate the types and
amounts of foods and beverages (including all types of
water) consumed during the 24-h period prior to the
interview. Participants' responses were used to estimate
intakes of energy, nutrients and other food components
from those foods and beverages.
The dietary interview component named What We
Eat in America (WWEIA) had been conducted as a part-
nership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS). Daily aggregates of food energy and 62
nutrients /food components from all foods were calcu-
lated for NHANES data collection using USDA's Food
and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS).
The FNDDS includes comprehensive information that
can be used to code individual foods and portion sizes
reported by participants, and also includes nutrient val-
ues for calculating nutrient intakes.33 For this study, only
First Day Interview data were used.
Statistical analyses
Sample weights were used to account for nonresponse
and unequal selection probabilities for certain categories
of the population. In addition to weighting on the basis
of age, gender and ethnicity which is introduced to make
the NHANES sample representative of the U.S. popula-
tion, sampling weights calculated specifically for analysis
of dietary recall interview components also accounted for
disproportionately represented intakes on weekends. In
addition, stratum and sampling units accounted for the
survey design effects using Taylor series linearisation.
Continuous variables such as nutrients measured in
grams or milligrams were compared using a t-test for a
contrasted mean. When merging NHANES study cycles,
appropriate selection of sampling weights and adjustment
coefficients were applied according to the NHANES Ana-
lytic and Reporting Guidelines.29 The prevalence of vari-
ous parameters, including demographic parameters and
metabolic syndrome components, was compared between
subjects with NAFLD and controls by the stratum-
specific chi-squared test for independence. P-values of 0.05
or less were considered potentially statistically significant.
Finally, logistic regression was used to identify indepen-
dent predictors of NAFLD among nutrition components
after adjustment for potential clinical confounders. All
analyses were run using SAS 9.1 and SUDAAN 10.0 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The study was approved
by the Inova Institutional Review Board.
RESULTS
Study population
Of the initial study population (41 658 participants from
NHANES 2001 to 2008), 18 550 were considered eligible
for the study. Of those, 1782 individuals (10.41 Æ 0.37%)
fulfilled the definition of NAFLD and 16 768 were used
as controls. The most relevant clinico-demographic dif-
ferences between individuals with NAFLD and controls
are noted in Table 1. As expected, individuals with
NAFLD were less likely African American and more
likely of Hispanic ethnicity, had higher rates of insulin
resistance, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity.
Nutrition and NAFLD
Of the 62 nutrient components used for the study, 24
(38%) were significantly different (P < 0.05) between the
NAFLD and control groups (Table 2). These included
total protein, dietary fibre, both mono- and polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids, total cholesterol together with a number
of vitamins and microelements. Of the significantly dif-
ferent nutrients, the various types of fats and cholesterol
were higher in the NAFLD cohort (P < 0.05). Further-
more, the amounts of daily sodium, selenium and caf-
feine were also different between those with and without
NAFLD (P < 0.05).
In the multivariate analysis, where nutritional compo-
nents were adjusted for demographic confounders such
as age, gender, ethnicity and metabolic syndrome
components, we found five independent predictors of
NAFLD: African American race (OR (95% CI) 0.520
(0.426­0.633), male gender (OR (95% CI) 1.329

(1.808­2.409), caffeine consumption (mg) (OR (95% CI)
0.999319 (0.998955­0.999684) and total plain water con-
sumption (g) (OR (95% CI) 1.000065 (1.000008­
1.000122) (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease develops due to exces-
sive fat accumulation in the liver, in the absence of sig-
nificant alcohol use. NAFLD is thought to be the hepatic
manifestation of metabolic syndrome and an early pre-
dictor of metabolic disorders amongst obese and normal-
weight populations.4, 34, 35 The spectrum of NAFLD
ranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepa-
titis (NASH). Although most cases of simple steatosis do
not progress, 10­15% of steatohepatitis cases can pro-
gress to cirrhosis 36, 37 and subsequently into more seri-
ous conditions, such as HCC.38 The rising incidence of
NAFLD observed in recent years necessitates a multi-dis-
ciplinary approach to understanding the causative factors
of this disease.
In this study, using the NHANES data collected
between 2001 and 2008 using similar methodology for
estimating daily nutrition intake, we assessed the nutri-
tional contribution on the prevalence of NAFLD. As
expected, individuals with NAFLD were less likely Afri-
can American and more likely of Hispanic ethnicity, had
higher rates of insulin resistance, hypercholesterolaemia
and obesity. In addition, when metabolic syndrome com-
ponents were included to the list of potential confound-
ers for NAFLD, obesity was also found to be
independently predictive of NAFLD.
Of the 62 nutrients assessed in the univariate analysis
between the NAFLD and control groups, 24 (38%) were
statistically different (P-value range = 0.0006­0.0493),
with caffeine consumption being significantly higher in
the control group without liver disease
(165.19 Æ 6.55 mg/day vs. 188.29 Æ 4.90 mg/day, P-
value = 0.0006). In addition to ranking in the top two in
terms of statistical significance, caffeine was one of the
only two compounds consumed independent from com-
pounds one might encounter in regular food intake
(Table 2). The inverse correlation between caffeine con-
sumption and NAFLD gained further significance in our
multivariate analysis as caffeine consumption was found
to be one of the five independent predictors of NAFLD,
remaining highly significant after adjustment for race,
gender and metabolic syndrome components (Table 3).
Specifically, if we converted daily caffeine intake to cups,
assuming 100 mg of caffeine in a cup, then, in the same
multivariate analysis, each extra cup could be associated
with lower odds of NAFLD (given everything else is
equal): OR = 0.931 (0.900­0.964). These data clearly indi-
cate a strong association between coffee consumption and

the prevalence of NAFLD and increase the plausibility that
coffee may indeed offer some protection against the devel-
opment of this condition. It is important to presume that
caffeine intake may have hepatoprotective effects up-to to
a certain threshold, after which no additional benefit can
be gained. However, our data analysis was not able to
establish a `safe' threshold for caffeine intake.
Despite the scarcity of data on the exact mechanism
by which coffee and its components impact the aetiology
of liver disease, there are some promising hypotheses
that may account for their metabolic actions. A recent
cell culture study, using HepG2 and CaCo2 cells indi-
cates that the UDP glucuronosyltransferase family of
genes, thought to be proteins with indirect antioxidant,
cytoprotective and genoprotective capabilities, are
induced by coffee, independent of caffeine content, sug-
gesting glucuronidation as a mechanisms for the protec-
tive and antioxidant effects of coffee.39 Previous studies
focusing on fibrosis have shown that the methylxanthine
caffeine, a large component of coffee, may inhibit the
synthesis of connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF/CCN2) in liver parenchymal and nonparenchy-

mal cells by initiating the degradation of Smad2/3, con-
sequently impairing the transforming growth factor b
(TGF-b) signalling.40 As CTGF and TGF-b are both well
known factors in fibrotic remodelling and carcinogenesis,
this mechanism may explain the protective effects of cof-
fee observed on fibrogenesis.
Shedding the most light on the impact of coffee on
NAFLD specifically, however, are a series of studies
assessing the impact of coffee on inflammatory cytokines.
The first is a study investigating the effects of coffee on
metabolic syndrome by looking at the gene expression in
the liver and adipose tissues of mice that were fed a
high-fat diet with added coffee, and finding a strong
induction of anti-inflammatory responses in the coffee
cohorts.41 A more recent study, of similar scope, assessed
the effects of coffee on the risk of type II diabetes using
spontaneously diabetic KK-A(y) mice and found that
white adipose tissue mRNA levels of the inflammatory
cytokines, MCP-1, IL-6, and TNFa, in addition to adi-
pose tissue MCP-1 and serum IL-6 concentrations in the
coffee cohort were lower than the control group, result-
ing in lower hyperglycaemia and an improvement of
fatty liver.42 In fact, recent animal studies have under-
lined the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of
coffee with regards to fat accumulation in general and
steatohepatitis in particular.43, 44
Interestingly, a recent study reported the effects of
adipocyte cytokine secretion on the development of NA-
FLD,45 in particular the increased levels of tumour
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and
IL-6 observed between the NAFLD and control sub-
jects.46 These data suggest that coffee, in addition to its
anti-oxidant properties, may exert a suppressive effect on
hyperglycaemia by improving insulin sensitivity, partly
due to a reduction of inflammatory cytokine expression
and subsequently, improving fatty liver.
Although far from conclusive, all of these data suggest
a plausible mechanism which may explain the strong
inverse correlation we found between caffeine intake and
the propensity to develop NAFLD. Furthermore, it is evi-
dent from the available data that the effects of coffee on
the aetiology of liver disease are indeed multi-factorial,
necessitating detailed mechanistic studies to understand
its exact impact.
In conclusion, using recent U.S. population data, we
have identified caffeine as being one of the most sig-
nificantly different nutrient components between the
NAFLD and control cohorts. Our data indicate that
caffeine may play a protective role in the development
of NAFLD. Furthermore, our multivariate analysis
highlighted caffeine consumption as one of five inde-
pendent predictors of NAFLD after adjustment for
important confounders. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study showing a substantial inverse cor-
relation between caffeine consumption and NAFLD
specifically, in humans using population-based data.
Despite the scarcity of mechanistic data on the protec-
tive effects of coffee in the aetiology of NAFLD, there
are some very plausible hypotheses suggesting that cof-
fee may have a suppressive effect on hyperglycaemia
by improving insulin sensitivity, partly due to a reduc-
tion of inflammatory cytokine expression. The impact
of coffee and its components on NAFLD in particular
and liver disease in general, need to be studied in
greater detail.
