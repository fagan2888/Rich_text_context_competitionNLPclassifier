ABSTRACT: A higher calcium intake is still the primary recommendation for the prevention of osteoporosis,
whereas vitamin D deficiency is often not addressed. To study the relative importance of dietary calcium
intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status in regard to hip BMD, 4958 community-dwelling
women and 5003 men 20 yr of age from the U.S. NHANES III population-based survey were studied.
Calcium supplement users and individuals with a prior radius or hip fracture were excluded. We calculated
standardized means for BMD by quartiles of sex-specific calcium intake for three 25(OH)D categories (<50,
50­74, and 75+ nM) among men and women, separately controlling for other important predictors of BMD.
A higher calcium intake was significantly associated with higher BMD (p value for trend: p = 0.005) only for
women with 25(OH)D status <50 nM, whereas calcium intake beyond the upper end of the lowest quartile
(>566 mg/d) was not significantly associated with BMD at 25(OH)D concentrations >50 nM. Among men,
there was no significant association between a higher calcium intake beyond the upper end of the lowest quartile
(626 mg/d) and BMD within all 25(OH)D categories. Among both sexes, BMD increased stepwise and signifi-
cantly with higher 25(OH)D concentrations (<50, 50­74, 75+ nM; p value for trend: women < 0.0001; men =
0.0001). Among men and women, 25(OH)D status seems to be the dominant predictor of BMD relative to
calcium intake. Only women with 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nM seem to benefit from a higher calcium intake.

INTRODUCTION
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS regarding optimal
intakes of calcium, which is reflected in markedly
different recommended daily intakes among countries. For
example, for adults >50 yr of age, it is 700 mg/d in the
United Kingdom and 1200 mg/d in the United States.(1)
These differences may be explained in part by the fact that
today calcium intake recommendations do not consider the
additional importance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
concentrations in regard to calcium absorption.
Recent studies have suggested that calcium absorption
is enhanced with higher 25(OH)D status.(2,3) Depending on
the size of this effect, calcium intake recommendations
may be overestimated among individuals with higher
25(OH)D concentrations. Consistent with this, an Icelan-
dic study suggested that, to maintain calcium metabolism,
calcium intakes beyond 800 mg/d may only be needed in
individuals with 25(OH)D concentrations <25 nM,
whereas among individuals with higher 25(OH)D concen-
trations, calcium intake did not correlate with PTH con-
centrations.(4)
To address the relative importance of calcium intake and
25(OH)D status in regard to hip BMD, we took advantage
of a large U.S. survey that included measures of BMD,
25(OH)D status, and calcium intake plus other important
determinants of BMD among adults 20 yr of age. BMD is
used to define peak bone mass in young adults,(5) and it is a
strong predictor of fractures in the elderly.(6)
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source and subjects
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey III (NHANES III) was conducted between 1988
and 1994 to study the health and nutritional status of the
noninstitutionalized U.S. population.(7) There were 16,573

individuals potentially eligible for BMD scans. Of these,
157 were excluded for medical reasons, and 14,646 scans
were technically acceptable. Serum 25(OH)D concentra-
tions were available for 14,083 of these individuals, 13,516
of which were either white, Mexican American, or black,
and 13,432 had complete data on smoking and body mass
index (BMI). Of these, 9962 had dietary calcium intake
recorded with a plausible upper intake of <3500 mg/d, did
not use calcium supplements, and had no prior radius or
hip fracture. One woman was excluded for a 25(OH)D
concentration of 400 nM. Thus, the final sample consisted
of 9961 individuals (4958 women and 5003 men).
Measurement of BMD
Areal total hip BMD (bone mass per unit of area scan-
ned) was measured using DXA on men and nonpregnant
women 20 yr of age (Lunar DPX).(8,9)
Dietary calcium intake
Calcium intake in milligrams per day was assessed in all
individuals with one 24-h dietary recall. In addition, as part
of a nonrandomly selected substudy of NHANES III, ;5%
of the respondents who came to the mobile exam center for
measurements were invited to ``repeat'' the 24-h recall (n =
974) within a few weeks after their initial visit. The same
computer-assisted instrument was used for this second as-
sessment. The within-person variability in the 24-h recall
will attenuate associations. For this reason, we used the de-
attenuation procedure correcting for measurement error
based on this one repeat measurement.
The correlation between the two measurements was 0.46
among men and 0.40 among women, suggesting a moderate
day-to-day variation in calcium intake. Consistently, previ-
ous studies have documented that day-to-day variation for
calcium intake is moderate compared with other micronu-
trients.(10,11) This may be explained by relatively consistent
daily dairy intakes compared with other foods.(11)
Serum concentration of 25(OH)D
Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were assayed with ra-
dioimmunoassay kits [DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, USA;
reference range for the assay is 22.5­94 nM (9­37.6 ng/ml);
measures 25(OH)D2
and 25(OH)D3
].(12) Serum 25(OH)D
concentrations in NHANES III were higher than in those
observed in the Icelandic Survey, with a small fraction <25
nM (4.2%), which is why we chose <50 nM as the lowest
25(OH)D category in this analysis. 25(OH)D concentra-
tions of at least 75 nM have been suggested as desirable for
optimal bone health(13) and fracture reduction.(14)
Other covariates
Respondents were classified as never smokers (if they
had smoked <100 cigarettes in their lifetime), former
smokers (100 lifetime cigarettes, not currently smoking),
and current smokers (100 lifetime cigarettes, currently
smoking). Smoking was studied as a potential confounder
because it affects BMD and reduces calcium absorption.(15)
The poverty income ratio was computed as the ratio of
family income versus the poverty threshold as produced
annually by the Census Bureau adjusted for changes
caused by inflation. BMI is weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared. We also adjusted for height as a
potential confounder independent of BMI because of its
correlation with calcium intake and BMD.(16) The variable
``any estrogen use'' (never, former, current) was created
from the response on the use and duration of use of ``birth
control pills'' and ``estrogen or female hormone pills.'' The
115 subjects with missing values were coded as missing.
Estrogen use was studied as a potential confounder be-
cause it affects BMD and increases vitamin D concentra-
tions by increasing vitamin D­binding globulin.(17)
Total calorie intake was computed from 24-h recalls and
included as a potential confounder for its correlation with
dietary calcium intake and association with BMD. Physical
activity was calculated from the following documented
activities, and their intensities were summarized by their
metabolic equivalent levels (METs): walked 1 mi without
stopping, swam, jogged, rode a bicycle, danced, exercised
or did garden work in the last month.(18) The METs were
calculated based on the frequency of each physical activity.
Statistical analyses
To minimize confounding by indication, this sample ex-
cluded individuals who used calcium supplements or had a
prior radius or hip fracture (these two fractures are specifi-
cally assessed in NHANES III). To account for errors in the
measurement of calcium intake, the regression calibration
method was used.(19,20) In the first step, measurement error­
corrected calcium intake was calculated based on one repeat
24-h recall from a 5% nonrandom subsample. We regressed
the repeated measure of calcium intake on the first measure
for each person, which was used as the main measurement
error­corrected calcium intake variable calculated as the
estimated linear regression coefficient times the measured
intake plus the constant [measurement error corrected cal-
cium intake =393 + (0.511 3 measured calcium intake)].
To further address error in measuring calcium intake, we
also used the multivariate regression calibration method
described by Spiegelman et al.,(20) where both the point and
interval estimates are corrected for measurement error, as
implemented in a SAS macro. This method is referred to as
the multivariate measurement error correction in Table 4.
General linear regression analyses were used to model
the association between measurement error­corrected di-
etary calcium intake and BMD. Five covariates, 25(OH)D,
sex, age, physical activity, and race/ethnicity,(9,21) were
considered as potential effect modifiers. Because both
measurement error­corrected calcium intake and 25(OH)D
concentrations were not normally distributed, effect mod-
ification was assessed after log transformation of these
variables. The p value of the interaction term from the
cross-product term [log 25(OH)D 3 log calcium intake]
was 0.005. We further studied effect modification using
stratification by sex, age group (20­49 and 50 yr), physical
activity (active/inactive), and race/ethnicity (white, black,
Mexican American) within each 25(OH)D category (<50,
50­74, and 75+ nM). Only for sex was effect modification
significant [p value of the interaction term: 0.01 in
25(OH)D category < 50 nM; 0.08 in 25(OH)D category
936 BISCHOFF-FERRARI ET AL.
50­74 nM; 0.01 in 25(OH)D category 75+ nM]. Therefore,
results are presented in six subgroups stratified by sex and
25(OH)D category. Because calcium intakes were higher
in men, dietary calcium intake was divided into sex-specific
quartiles. Standardized means for BMD by quartiles of
dietary calcium intake within each vitamin D category
were calculated using regression analysis and adjusting for
the following variables: age (10-yr age categories), race/
ethnicity (white, black, Mexican American), BMI, height,
total calorie intake, estrogen use among women, physical
activity, smoking, and socio-economic status. The data
were standardized to a person of median height and me-
dian BMI, with a median calorie intake, age 60­69 yr, of a
median socio-economic status, and in the top tertile of
physical activity. Among women, the data were also stan-
dardized to women not taking estrogen.
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.1.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the characteristics of participants. Men
had significantly higher 25(OH)D concentrations, higher
measurement error­adjusted calcium intake, higher BMD,
and greater physical activity than women. Seventeen per-
cent of all men and 27% of all women were physically
inactive, defined as 0 METs, indicating that these individuals
did not walk 1 mi without stopping, did not swim, jog, ride a
bicycle, dance, exercise, or do garden work in the last
month. Table 2 shows calcium intake by age group, sex, and
race/ethnicity. Table 3 shows mean 25(OH)D concentra-
tions by age among white, black, and Mexican-American
men and women.

RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIETARY CALCIUM AND 25(OH)D 937
We found that the association between calcium intake
and total hip BMD was significantly modified by sex and
25(OH)D concentration but not by age, physical activity,
or race/ethnicity. Thus, results are presented for six sub-
groups determined by sex and three concentrations of
25(OH)D. These multivariate analyses are shown in Fig.
1A for women and Fig. 1B for men. The bars show stan-
dardized means of total hip BMD by quartiles of mea-
surement error corrected calcium intake in three 25(OH)D
categories (<50, 50­74, and 75+ nM). Among women, only
at 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nM was a higher calcium
intake significantly associated with higher BMD (p value
for trend: p = 0.005). Among women with 25(OH)D concen-
trations >50 nM, a calcium intake above the lowest quartile
(>566 mg/d) was not associated with higher BMD. Among
men, there was no significant association between a higher
calcium intake and BMD within any 25(OH)D category.
To address the potential influence of menopausal status on
calcium absorption among women, we performed subgroup
analysesamongwomen<50,50­69,and70yrofage.Among
women 50 yr of age, we excluded women who reported
estrogen therapy (n = 178). In the younger women and
women 70 yr of age, women in the lowest 25(OH)D cate-
gory seemed to benefit from a higher calcium intake, whereas
women with higher 25(OH)D levels did not. However,
among women 50­69 yr of age, a higher calcium intake was
not associated with BMD at any 25(OH)D category, whereas
independent of calcium intake, BMD increased stepwise with
each higher 25(OH)D status category, similar to our results
for all men and women (data not shown).
Table 4 shows calcium intake as a continuous variable
predicting BMD in each of the six subgroups. We first ex-
amined continuous calcium intake without measurement
error correction and then the multivariate error correction
including an inflation of the SE. The results from both
continuous calcium intake analyses were consistent with
the main analyses by quartiles of calcium intake (Figs. 1A
and 1B).

The percent of individuals with adequate 25(OH)D concentrations of at least 75 nM was highest among white individuals and lowest among blacks.
Nonetheless, the adequate 25(OH)D concentration segment of the white population diminished with age, especially among white women. Inactive
individuals of all ethnic groups had lower 25(OH)D concentrations.

DISCUSSION
Our study examined the relative importance of dietary
calcium intake and 25(OH)D serum concentrations with
respect to total hip BMD among a large sample of com-
munity-dwelling individuals 20 yr of age. Among women
with low 25(OH)D concentrations, there was a statistically
significant positive association between calcium intake and
BMD, whereas among women with 25(OH)D concentra-
tions >50 nM, a higher calcium intake was not appreciably
associated with BMD. Among men, calcium intake was not
associated with BMD in all three 25(OH)D categories.
Calcium is a structural component of bone, and calcium
supplementation may improve BMD and reduce fractures
by suppressing PTH secretion and thus reducing bone re-
sorption.(22) In a 2004 meta-analysis of randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs), calcium supplementation of 500­2000
mg/d in postmenopausal women provided a modest benefit
on BMD: 2.05% difference in total body BMD, 1.66% for
lumbar spine BMD, and 1.64% for hip BMD.(23,24) How-
ever, the effects of calcium supplementation on BMD seem
to represent a one-time increment that does not continue to
accrue with time,(25,26) and the implications for fracture risk
prevention of such small differences are unclear.
Observational studies of the association between dietary
calcium intake and hip fracture risk were summarized in a
recent meta-analysis.(27) For seven studies including
170,991 women with 2954 hip fractures, there was no as-
sociation between total calcium intake and hip fracture risk
(pooled RR per 300 mg of total calcium = 1.01; 95% CI:
0.97, 1.05). Similarly, in five studies with 68,606 men and
214 hip fractures, there was no significant benefit of a
higher calcium intake (pooled RR per 300 mg of total
calcium = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.03).(26) For randomized
trials of calcium supplementation alone, five studies (5666
primarily postmenopausal women plus 1074 men) with 814
nonvertebral fractures were pooled. Comparing calcium
supplementation (800­1600 mg/d) with placebo, the pooled
RR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.81, 1.05). Based on four studies
with separate results for hip fracture (6504 individuals with
139 hip fractures), the pooled RR comparing calcium with
placebo was 1.64 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.64).(28)

RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIETARY CALCIUM AND 25(OH)D 939
One potential explanation for the lack of an observed
protective effect in the most recent meta-analysis is that
participants in the trials already were consuming ``enough''
calcium, which would explain the neutral effect on non-
vertebral fractures. Additionally, it is possible that
25(OH)D concentrations were high enough so that addi-
tional calcium supplementation had no effect on fracture
reduction. In fact, baseline 25(OH)D concentrations were
>50 nM in four of five trials, and mean baseline concen-
tration across all five trials was 61.5 nM.(25,28­31)
Regarding the suggested adverse effect of calcium sup-
plementation on hip fracture risk in the most recent meta-
analysis on calcium alone,(28) it is possible that among the
frail individuals at risk for hip fractures, other deficiencies
need correction along with adequate calcium intake.(32)
Calcium carbonate or citrate supplements, as used in the
trials pooled for the meta-analysis, can reduce phosphate
absorption,(33) which may be detrimental because a bal-
anced calcium­phosphate ratio is needed for bone miner-
alization.(34) Each increase in calcium intake by 500 mg/d
decreases phosphorus absorption by 166 mg,(33) so a cal-
cium supplement of 1000 mg may shift an elderly person on
a relatively low phosphorus intake caused by a low protein
intake into phosphate deficiency.(33,35) This could augment
bone resorption(33,36,37) and thus increase fracture risk.
Our analyses suggested that, for women, a calcium in-
take beyond 566 mg/d, the upper end of the lowest calcium
intake quartile, may be sufficient if 25(OH)D concentra-
tions are at least 50 nM. This may be explained by a cal-
cium-sparing effect of higher 25(OH)D concentrations.(2)
Thus, individuals with higher 25(OH)D concentrations
may need less calcium to absorb the basic amount needed
for bone mineralization. However, in this national survey,
45.7% of women had 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nM. In
this group of women, a higher calcium intake beyond 566
mg/d may be warranted, or, these women could be sup-
plemented with vitamin D to shift them to 25(OH)D con-
centration >50 nM or best >75 nM.
Mean dietary calcium intakes were significantly higher
among men, which may explain why men at any 25(OH)D
serum concentration had no additional benefit of a higher
dietary calcium intake beyond 626 mg/d (upper end of the
lowest intake quartile).
Calcium absorption efficacy declines with age and at
menopause.(38,39) This may in part be explained by de-
clining 25(OH)D levels with age.(2,40) Additionally, at
menopause, loss of estrogen triggers bone loss that in turn
results in a subtle increase in serum ionized calcium, which
suppresses PTH, lowers 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D produc-
tion, and lowers calcium absorption.(41­43) Consistent with
earlier findings by Dawson-Hughes et al.,(43) we found no
correlation between higher calcium intake and BMD
among women in the age range of early menopause (50­
69), even among women in the lowest 25(OH)D category.
Our findings of a primary role of 25(OH)D serum con-
centrations relative to calcium intake in all women inde-
pendent of age and menopausal status are consistent with
those from Khosla et al.,(44) where 25(OH)D serum con-
centration was the strongest inverse correlate of PTH
among premenopausal and postmenopausal women with
or without estrogen replacement therapy, whereas calcium
intake was a weak inverse correlate of PTH in all subgroups.
Dose of vitamin D supplementation needed for serum
25(OH)D correction could be estimated based on a dose­
response calculation proposed by Heaney,(45) where a 1.0
nM increase in 25(OH)D level can be expected with l mg
vitamin D3
/d (40 IU) at low starting levels and a 0.6 nM
25(OH)D increase can be expected per l mg vitamin D3
/d at
higher starting levels (i.e., >70 nM). A similar observation
has been reported for vitamin D2
in one study,(46) whereas
some studies suggested less efficacy in raising 25(OH)D
levels with daily(47) or intermittent D2
.(48) Studies in older

persons showed that 25(OH)D concentrations could be in-
creased by ;40­65 nM to mean concentrations of 75­100
nM with 800­1000 IU of vitamin D per day.(32,49­52) Higher
intakes may, however, be needed among individuals with
low starting concentrations of 25(OH)D(53) and those who
are overweight or obese,(54) because effects of supplemen-
tation depend on starting concentrations and body size.
Consistent with the literature,(55,56) in this large sample of
adult individuals, 25(OH)D concentrations decreased dra-
matically with age, darker skin tone, female sex, and inactivity.
Among individuals 20­29 yr of age, 34% of white women,
35% of white men, 79% of Mexican-American women, 63%
of Mexican-American men, 94% of black women, and 85% of
black men had 25(OH)D concentrations <75 nM. Among
individuals 80 yr of age, 79% of white women, 59% of white
men, 80% of Mexican-American women, 76% of Mexican-
American men, 94% of black women, and 85% of black men
had 25(OH)D concentrations <75 nM.
The strengths of the study are its large sample size that
provided enough power to perform stratification by 25(OH)D
category and sex. One limitation is the cross-sectional design,
which prevents one from assigning a causal relationship be-
tween vitamin D concentrations or calcium intake and BMD.
However, a causal relationship between both calcium and vi-
tamin D supplementation has been shown in several ran-
domized controlled trials.(24,25,32,49) Furthermore, our results
pertain to total hip BMD and may not reflect the relation of
calcium intake or vitamin D status to the entire skeleton or
other endpoints for which the optimal intake of calcium or
vitamin D intake may well be substantially different.
An advantage of the cross-sectional design is that this is
more likely to represent the long-term effects of calcium
intake and 25(OH)D serum concentrations, as opposed to
a short-term intervention. Furthermore, results were con-
sistent, independent of how calcium intake was analyzed
(with or without measurement error correction, in quartiles
or as a continuous variable).
In conclusion, our study adds support to the concept that
the correction of 25(OH)D status is more important than
increasing dietary calcium intake beyond 566 mg/d among
women and 626 mg/d among men for better hip BMD. A
higher calcium intake beyond 566 mg/d may only be im-
portant among women with 25(OH)D concentrations <50
nM, whereas among women with higher 25(OH)D con-
centrations, hip BMD is not correlated with calcium
intake. Among men, the need for a calcium intake beyond
625 mg/d in respect to total hip BMD is not supported by our
results, whereas higher 25(OH)D concentrations were as-
sociated with higher BMD among men and women. Within
this sample of U.S. adults, a large fraction of younger and
older adults was below the desirable 25(OH)D threshold of
at least 75 nM, whereas calcium intakes seemed to be ade-
quate in the majority of individuals with respect to hip
BMD.
