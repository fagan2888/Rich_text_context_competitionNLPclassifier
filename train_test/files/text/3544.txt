Software professionals (SPs) are engineers who write code,
design, and test configuration architectures, manage system
networks, analyze webs, develop portals, and do software
maintenance jobs. The job performance of SPs and the
employment in information technology (IT) industry have
increased the contribution of the IT sector to India's gross
domestic product (GDP) from 6.4% in 2008 to 7.5% in 2012
("IT Industry Grows to Rs. 91,800 Crore in FY '12," The
Economic Times, 2012). Despite this, the antecedents and
facilitators of SPs' performance are hardly examined. The
research literature has provided a rich set of variables that
affect their performance in the workplace. However, the
ways in which those variables affect productivity and perfor-
mance are not well understood. The purpose of this study is
to develop an integrated model of variables that determine
SPs' performance. We begin with an overview of the con-
structs of productivity and performance described in the
research literature. Following that, the known effects of spe-
cific variables on performance will be used to motivate the
proposed model.
Measuring SPs' Performance
Assessing the performance of SPs is a difficult task. In some
contexts, performance is operationalized as input­output
productivity. This approach to assessing performance is
rather tenuous, as the inputs and outputs of projects can take
a month to a year or even more. In the software industry, SPs
simultaneously work on many projects and produce different
outputs--graphics, expert systems, web traffic control, and
maintenance packages--that are difficult to specify in terms
of quantity of inputs and outputs (Kemppila & Lonnqvist,
2003). Objective measures of SPs' productivity (such as
kilo-lines/man-months) are narrow and focus on lower order
single constructs. Some indirect factors that influence pro-
ductivity cannot be easily measured, such as management
culture, disturbances at work, and problems in information
flow. There is no uniform procedure for assessing software
productivity that follows a normal distribution pattern that
would afford subsequent calibration. Software firms have
synonymously used measures of effectiveness, efficiency,
quality, innovation, and profitability (Chilton & Hardgrave,
2004; Koss & Lewis, 1993; Sumanth, 1994; Tangen, 2004;
Thomas & Baron, 1994) for measures of productivity, and
they have linked these measures to SPs' performance.

Antecedents and Moderators of Software
Professionals' Performance
Shiva Prasad H. C.1, Damodar Suar2, and Roman Taraban3
Abstract
Software professionals' (SPs') performance is often understood narrowly in terms of input­output productivity. This study
approaches performance from a broader perspective and examines whether the emotional intelligence competencies (EICs)
of SPs, the leadership style of team leaders, social capital among team members, and human resource management (HRM)
practices of software firms affect performance of SPs. It also tests whether the value of and opportunities for knowledge
sharing moderate such relationships. Data were collected from 441 Indian SPs in a questionnaire survey. Fifty-five team
leaders assessed the performance of SPs, and SPs assessed the other constructs. Results revealed that EICs, transformational
leadership style, social capital, and HRM practices positively affect performance. EICs are the most important predictors
of performance. Under high (low) value of and high (low) opportunities for knowledge sharing, the antecedents influencing
performance are strengthened (attenuated or nullified). The value of and opportunities for knowledge sharing are quasi-
moderators. These findings have significant implications for organizing effective work teams.

Measures of performance, instead of productivity, are
broad and cover higher order behavioral attributes.
Performance refers to the degree to which employees have
executed their assigned jobs. It includes not only the activi-
ties related to accomplishment of core job tasks but also a set
of behaviors that employees contribute both directly and
indirectly to organizational goals (Rich, LePine, & Crawford,
2010). Performance requires a set of criteria for its evalua-
tion depending on the nature of the job.
Theoretical Framework for a
Performance Model
Goleman (1995) has proposed that emotional intelligence
competencies (EICs) can alone contribute to four fifths of
job performance against one fifth of cognitive/rational intel-
ligence. In support of this assertion, Boyatzis, Goleman, and
Rhee (2000) have reported that employees with high levels
of EICs are 3 times more effective than those with low levels
of EICs. This is a strong assertion. However, there are coun-
terclaims (Antonakis, Ashkanasy, & Dasborough, 2009). A
meta-analytic study (Van Rooy & Viswesvaran, 2004) reports
only a correlation of .19 between emotional intelligence and
performance outcomes. Accordingly, the position in this arti-
cle is that group and enterprise level constructs may also play
a significant role in conjunction with individual level con-
structs of EICs, to determine workplace performance.
Leadership is a predominant factor in influencing perfor-
mance among group behaviors (Bass, 1985). Fostering social
interactions and attributes of trusting, sharing, and recipro-
cating among SPs incorporated in social capital can build
relationships, resolve conflicts, and smooth group processes
to improve performance. Enterprise level constructs are
those that are regulated by the top management. Among
structure, design, and culture of the enterprise, human
resource management (HRM) practices can contribute to
employees' welfare, development, and commitment, which
can boost up performance as well. Given the meta-analytic
findings contrary to Goleman's (1995) claim, this study will
test an integrated model to simultaneously examine the affect
of EICs, leadership, social capital, and HRM practices on
SPs' performance and the constructs that boost the anteced-
ent­consequent relations. Furthermore, most of the studies
on SPs have been carried out in individualistic Euro-
American cultures. This study strives to extend those find-
ings to the collectivist culture of India to gauge whether the
findings from different cultural contexts reinforce each other.
Potential Variables Influencing the
Performance of SPs
Multi-Factor Performance
A study on Indian SPs revealed six dimensions of perfor-
mance (Prasad & Suar, 2010): (a) work-efficiency, (b) per-
sonal resourcefulness, (c) inter- and intra-personal sensitivity,
(d) productivity orientation, (e) timeliness, and (f) business
intelligence. Work-efficiency focuses on independent think-
ing, ability to work on various projects simultaneously, pro-
gramming skills, and customer orientation. Personal
resourcefulness incorporates the abilities of SPs to be inno-
vative and efficient, thereby adding value to the customer
through products and services. Inter- and intra-personal sen-
sitivity show not only individuals' responsibility at work but
also cooperativeness with the team members to complete the
job. Productivity orientation entails the concern for quantity
and quality of software along with overtime work. The time-
liness dimension incorporates taking decisions and meeting
deadlines in completing the projects. Business intelligence is
a personal attribute for business sustenance in a competitive
environment through advocating new ideas for improving
products, services, and showing concern for profitability.
Measures of these six dimensions operationalize the con-
struct of performance in this study.
EICs
Emotional intelligence was developed by Salovey and Mayer
(1990) and popularized by Goleman (1995) as a "compe-
tency" model. It is the ability of a person to cognitively
assess emotions within oneself and recognize them in others,
so as to modulate behavior (Salovey & Mayer, 1990). Simply,
it is the use of emotions intelligently. EICs incorporate
(a) self-awareness, (b) self-management, (c) social-aware-
ness, and (d) relationship management (Boyatzis et al.,
2000). The former two entail personal and the latter two
inter-personal competencies.
By understanding their own experiences, thoughts, and
actions, self-aware persons realistically self-evaluate them-
selves (Wynekoop & Walz, 2000) and openly express their
feelings, viewpoints, and focus on customer requirements
(Kaluzniacky, 2004; Phillips & Gully, 1997). Self-
management includes self-control, drive for achievement,
initiatives, transparency, and personal goal-setting. SPs who
have higher self-management competencies can take initia-
tive, exhibit creativity, and improve software quality, thereby
facilitating the success of software projects (Baddoo, Hall, &
Jagielsk, 2006; Mathew, 2007).
Social-awareness includes empathy, service orientation,
and organizational awareness. Empathy is not only reading
the subtleties of body language, but also grasping the unheard
voice beneath the spoken words (Goleman, 1998). Empathic
employees are trained to adopt themselves to a service orien-
tation, treating clients and co-workers as important custom-
ers (Witt, 1999). Organizational awareness is the
understanding of priorities and work processes. SPs, having
greater social-awareness, can interact and communicate with
offshore clients, and show sensitivity to cross-cultural eti-
quettes and different ethnic and religious backgrounds.
Relationship management is a set of competencies that
deal with inspiring, influencing, resolving conflicts, collabo-
rating with teams and acting as change agents. Inspiring is a
Prasad et al. 3
process of communicating, encouraging, and persuading oth-
ers, and elevating them to a higher plane. Conflict resolution
is an ability to tactfully deal with the incompatible demands
on or off the job. Change-catalyst competence is necessary to
adapt to the changing software specifications of clients. The
above discussion suggests that personal and inter-personal
competencies in the workplace can positively affect
performance.
Leadership Style
The prototype of leadership is transformational leadership.
Transformational leaders possess the characteristics of char-
ismatic, ethical, and servant-leaders (Shiva & Suar, 2012),
and are found to be universally effective (Atwater &
Yammarino, 1992; Barber & Warn, 2005; Bass, 1997; Burns,
1978; Leban & Zulauf, 2004).
Bass and Avolio (1990a) have identified four dimensions
of transformational leaders: (a) idealized influence (attribute
and behavior), (b) inspirational motivation, (c) intellectual
stimulation, and (d) individualized consideration. Leaders,
having idealized attributes and behavior, are found to have
profound power and extraordinary influence on followers
(Bass, 1985). Idealized actions of the leader transcend self-
interests for the benefits of the organization. Through com-
munication, the leader aligns the values and goals of the
organization to subordinates. Intellectually stimulating lead-
ers encourage followers to view the world from new perspec-
tives, that is, they question old assumptions, paradigms, and
beliefs. They appeal to followers' intellects by instilling
"problem awareness and problem-solving capabilities."
Because of intellectual stimulation, followers conceptualize
and comprehend the problems they face and solve them.
Such a leader (Avolio, Gardner, Walumbwa, Luthans, &
May, 2004) through episodes, dialogues, and various actions
takes the followers to a higher plane, and they release their
efforts accordingly. A leader displaying individualized con-
sideration understands the employees' needs, aspirations,
abilities, and accordingly provides different types of train-
ing, coaching, counseling, and opportunities for their partici-
pation in goal-setting, decision-making, and problem-solving
(Avolio, Bass, Walumbwa, & Zhu, 2004). In the process,
subordinates improve their skills. A transformational leader
generates positive work attitudes, mobilizes the minds of
subordinates, and empowers and enhances their performance
(Chi & Pan, 2012). A meta-analytic study of 25 years of
research concluded that transformational leaders lead not
only their individual subordinates but also their teams and
organizations to achieve higher levels of performance
(Wang,Oh, Courtright,&Colbert,2011).
Social Capital
Social capital incorporates (a) group characteristics, (b) gen-
eralized norms, (c) togetherness, (d) everyday socializing,
(e) volunteerism, (f) trust, and (g) reciprocity (Narayan &
Cassidy, 2001). Group characteristics facilitate group mem-
bers to carry out social activities. Generalized norms involve
compliance with group standards through which participants
of the network improve their performance to match with the
standard. During a crisis, togetherness evokes strong social
ties in the network and, thus, improves confidence to per-
form the job better. Everyday socializing strengthens friend-
ships and helps gathering current information about software
projects that assist SPs to make and execute decisions.
Volunteerism goes with altruism. Volunteers commence their
work without seeking help from others. Such activities keep
clients happy and build long-term relationships. Trust is an
act of agreement about certain conditions and standards
(Lemmel, 2001; Putnam, 1993; Welsh & Pringle, 2001) that
can improve SPs' performance. Reciprocity is an attitude of
helping when employees are in distress (Portes, 1998) and
responding to customers' needs. Because SPs are clustered
into groups according to projects, domain expertise, and cus-
tomers' base, they reciprocate within their network.
A software project roughly passes through task definition,
design specification, coding, installation, and maintenance.
It is less likely to succeed without task-related internal com-
munication (Brodbeck, 2001), cooperation, trust, and reci-
procity among team members when standardization of
methods and tools is low. Accordingly, the more social capi-
tal among SPs, the more effective will be the project success
through employees' performance.
HRM Practices
HRM practices include (a) rewards that drive performance;
(b) development of skills, knowledge, and attitudes through
continuous training to improve employees' performance;
(c) manpower with requisite skills and competencies to exe-
cute jobs; and (d) supportive workplaces (Appelbaum,
Bailey, Berg, & Kalleberg, 2001; Huselid, 1995). It is theo-
rized that if the firm closely links rewards to performance,
employees are more likely to show high performance
(Adams, 1965). Training and development activities for SPs
focus on multi-skilling, developing domain expertise, teach-
ing the right ways to do the job, and reducing dysfunctional
behavior, all of which are likely to improve their work behav-
ior vis-à-vis performance. Earlier studies affirm that HRM
policies and practices have positive effects on firm perfor-
mance and productivity (Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Huselid,
1995). Firm performance and productivity are outcomes of
employees'performance. Also, as the employees receive and
perceive favorably the HRM practices, their performance
increases accordingly (Munjuri, 2011).
Software firms focus on obtaining qualified people and
rotating them across different jobs to make them multi-
skilled. Staffing procedures bring into vacant positions peo-
ple with the required skills and knowledge to do the job.
Promoting employees from within the firm is likely to
4 SAGE Open
provide a strong motivation for employees to work harder to
be promoted. It signals that the firm considers its employees
as long-term assets.
Asupportive workplace includes the provisions of employ-
ees' stock-option plans, physical evidence, safety, security,
and offshore assignments. Employees can work hard to
increase the quality of software products, so that the stock
price of the software firm does not decrease. As long as the
stock price increases, employees can continue their jobs.
Physical evidence improves the decor of the workplace.
According to the stimulus­organism­response theory
(Mehrabian & Russell, 1974), physical evidence (stimulus) of
the software firm can influence employees'(organism) behav-
ior (response). Physical evidence differentiates between
firms' interior decor through comfortable seating arrange-
ments, pleasant lighting, temperature, and cleanliness. It elic-
its approach behavior toward places such as desire to stay,
explore, work, and affiliate. For example, Google (Inc.) pro-
vides opportunities to SPs in architectural design to modify
their workplace interiors. After global threats on the health
and life of SPs, more and more software firms have focused
on improving employees' safety and security by providing
safe drinking water and high value insurance policies. With
offshore assignments, SPs get exposed to different cultures,
people, and different ways of managing software. Software
firms with all such practices can promote employees' perfor-
mance (Dechawatanapaisal, 2005).
Facilitators of Performance
In knowledge-intensive software firms, SPs evaluate tasks
and seek opportunities to gain useful information from col-
leagues and group members. Valuing knowledge sharing
reinforces SPs to exchange knowledge that will be cogni-
tively and emotionally satisfying to colleagues. Avenues for
knowledge sharing provide a platform and equal opportuni-
ties to all to learn, grow, and leverage their performance.
Value of Knowledge Sharing
Knowledge sharing enables communication, coding prac-
tices, and reuse of software, which contribute to the effec-
tiveness of SPs (McDougall & Beattie, 1998). The value of
knowledge sharing includes the feeling and action for shar-
ing knowledge among colleagues (Minbaeva, 2008). When
employees value knowledge sharing, it brings more insights
to software projects, helps sorting out project complexities,
and increases performance (Jarvenpaa & Staples, 2001; Lin,
2007).At times, even negligible pieces of knowledge become
highly valued benefactors in R&D projects (Armbrecht,
Chapas, Chappelow, & Farris, 2001; Ipe, 2003), intimately
connect people (Spinello, 2000), and contribute to the proj-
ect success. Sharing valuable knowledge with peers and the
team leader makes SPs more committed, motivated, and pro-
ductive (Hislop, 2002). SPs who highly value knowledge
sharing improve their performance compared with those who
find little value in knowledge sharing.
Opportunities for Knowledge Sharing
Opportunities for knowledge sharing through the Internet,
intranet, group discussions, narrative experiences, blogs, and
social networking create an environment of mutual trust,
cooperation, and goodwill (Cheng, Hailin, & Hongming,
2008). Such opportunities allow employees to collate, store,
share, modify, and use relevant knowledge. Employees share
knowledge to meet the demands for new knowledge to
accomplish project goals. Employees not only share difficul-
ties and hidden pitfalls in software projects, but also their
intuitions and hunches based on "experiential learning"
(Kolb, 1984). By sharing knowledge, employees learn the
nitty-gritty of projects and clients'requirements from knowl-
edge repositories (Bobbitt & Dabholkar, 2001; Gibbert &
Krause, 2002). With positive attitudes, commitment, trust,
and reciprocity among employees, knowledge sharing will
increase. With more opportunities for knowledge sharing,
the EICs of SPs, the transformational style of team leaders,
the social capital among SPs, and the HRM practices of firms
influencing performance will be strengthened. The reverse
will happen with fewer opportunities for knowledge sharing.
In the absence of opportunities for knowledge sharing, it is
impossible to build knowledge repositories and encourage
employees to take initiative to share knowledge, integrate
work problems, supervisors' efforts, and teams' difficulties
and successes.
Hypotheses and Proposed Model
In consideration of the existing research associated with
potential variables affecting performance, the following
multi-part hypothesis (H) is proposed:
Hypothesis 1a (H1a): EICs of SPs will directly affect
their job performance.
Hypothesis 1b (H1b): Transformational leadership of
team leaders will directly affect SPs' job performance.
Hypothesis 1c (H1c): Social capital among SPs will
directly affect their job performance.
Hypothesis 1d (H1d): HRM practices of software firms
will directly affect SPs' job performance.
Variables modifying antecedent­consequent relationships
are called moderators. It is further proposed that
Hypothesis 2a (H2a): (i) Values of knowledge sharing
and (ii) opportunities for knowledge sharing will have a
positive moderating effect on H1a (EICs  job
performance).
Hypothesis 2b (H2b): (i) Values of knowledge sharing
and (ii) opportunities for knowledge sharing will have a
Prasad et al. 5
positive moderating effect on H1b (leadership  job
performance).
Hypothesis 2c (H2c): (i) Values of knowledge sharing
and (ii) opportunities for knowledge sharing will have a
positive moderating effect on H1c (social capital  job
performance).
Hypothesis 2d (H2d): (i) Values of knowledge sharing
and (ii) opportunities for knowledge sharing will have a
positive moderating effect on H1d (HRM practices  job
performance).
The model, depicting the hypothesized relations, is illus-
trated (Figure 1). To sum up, the goal of this research was to
assess and model the impact of the EICs of SPs along with
the transformational style of team leaders, the social capital
among SPs, and the HRM practices of firms on performance
of SPs. A related question is whether a high value of knowl-
edge sharing and more opportunities for knowledge sharing
boost such relationships.
Method
Participants
Software engineers and senior software engineers were sur-
veyed through questionnaires at three IT hubs: Bangalore,
Hyderabad, and Kolkata in India. The lists of employees
were procured from the human resource (HR) managers of
eight software firms at these places. A total of 1,400 software
engineers and senior software engineers who had at least
2 years of experience in the software firm were selected.
They were contacted through telephone calls and emails.
With their consent, 1,313 persons were personally handed
over the questionnaire, and the questionnaire was sent to the
remaining 83 persons through emails. They were assured
complete anonymity of their responses. They were asked to
return the questionnaire after a fortnight. In all, 371 SPs
returned the completed questionnaires when the researcher
personally approached them and 70 sent the completed ques-
tionnaires through emails (effective return rate = 31.5%). An
additional 35 incomplete questionnaires received were
deleted from the database.
The sociodemographic profiles of the two groups of SPs
were compared with F and 2 tests (Table 1). Senior software
engineers were older, F(1, 439) = 146.53, p< .001; had more
years of formal education, F(1, 439) = 31.031, p< .001; had
more years of experience, F(1, 439) = 124.11, p< .001; and
had more annual salary, F(1, 439) = 52.52, p< .001, than the
software engineers. By and large, senior software engineers
and software engineers had nuclear families and did not dif-
fer on family size, F(1, 439) = .94, p> .05. There were pro-
portionally fewer female members compared with male
members among the software and senior software engineers,
2(1) = 113.70, p< .001. While there were equal proportions
of married and unmarried senior software engineers, 2(1) =
.03, p> .05, about four fifths of software engineers were
unmarried, 2(1) = 90.45, p< .001.

assessed the performance of SPs through a separate
questionnaire.
Performance.The team leader was asked to rate his or her
team members on 16 items given in the questionnaire consid-
ering the past 1-year performance. SPs reported the name of
their team leaders, and accordingly in each questionnaire the
name of the SP was included and given to the respective
team leader for assessing performance. Response categories
were given on a ladder with 10 steps ranging from poor (0) to
excellent (9). Validation of the scale to assess performance
was reported by Prasad and Suar (2010). In that validation,
ratings of SPs by team leaders were subjected to exploratory
factor analysis, and six factors were extracted that explained
60.42% of total variance. The first factor loaded significantly
on 4 items of "independent thinking," "handling of multiple
projects," "mastery of skills and techniques," and "focus on
customers." This factor was termed as "work-efficiency."
The second factor loaded significantly on 3 items of "effi-
cient at work," "creating value to customers," and "creativ-
ity/innovation"thatwasnamedas"personalresourcefulness."
The third factor loaded on 2 items of "responsible at work"
and "cooperativeness with team members" that was termed
as "inter- and intra-personal sensitivity," which can be
renamed as "personal and group responsibility." The fourth
factor loaded on 3 items of "working overtime to complete
projects," "quantity concerned," and "quality conscious-
ness," which was termed as "productivity orientation." The
fifth factor loaded on 2 items of "taking decisions" and
"meeting deadlines" that was termed as "timeliness." The
last factor loaded on 2 items of "advocating new ideas for
improving product" and "showing concern for profitability"
that was termed as "business intelligence." High additive
scores on items of a factor indicated more presence of that
factor.
EICs.EICs were assessed with a 110-item scale developed
by Boyatzis et al. (2000). The scale had four dimensions:
(a) self-awareness, (b) self-management, (c) social-aware-
ness, and (d) relationship management. A sample item on (a)
self-awareness includes "I can recognize the situation that
arouses my emotion"; (b) self-management includes "I stay
composed and positive, even in difficult moments"; (c)
social-awareness includes "I can make myself available to
customers/clients"; and (d) relationship management
includes "I identify and use opportunities to meet new people
and develop new contacts." All items were rated on a Likert-
type scale--not at all true (0) to always true (4). High addi-
tive scores on items of a dimension indicated more presence
of that dimension.
Transformational leadership.
The Multifactor Leadership
Questionnaire (Bass & Avolio, 1990b) was used to assess the
extent of transformational leadership of the team leader. The
scale had four dimensions: (a) idealized influence (attitude
and behavior), (b) inspirational motivation, (c) intellectual
stimulation, and (d) individualized consideration. A sample
item on (a) idealized influence includes "My team leader
goes beyond self-interest for the good of the group";
(b) inspirational motivation includes "My team leader talks
optimistically about the future"; (c) intellectual stimulation
includes "My team leader suggests new ways of looking at
how to complete assignments"; and (d) individualized con-
sideration includes "My team leader spends time teaching
and coaching me." Response descriptions against each item
were given on a Likert-type scale ranging from strongly dis-
agree (0) to strongly agree (4). High additive scores on items
of a dimension indicated a more favorable evaluation of that
dimension.
Social capital.Social capital was assessed using a 32-item
scale developed by Narayan and Cassidy (2001). The scale
had seven dimensions: (a) group characteristics, (b) general-
ized norms, (c) togetherness, (d) everyday socializing,
(e) volunteerism, (f) trust, and (g) reciprocity. A sample item
on (a) group characteristics includes "I often participate in

includes "I volunteer myself for cultural programmes";
(f) trust includes "I trust members of my sports community";

needs." Response descriptions against each item were on a
Likert-type scale--from a very small extent (0) to a very
large extent (4). High additive scores on items of a dimen-
sion indicated a more favorable evaluation of that
dimension.
HRM practices.HRM practices were assessed using the
instrument developed by Dechawatanapaisal (2005). The
dimensions of HRM practices were (a) performance-linked
incentives, (b) training and development, and (c) staffing.
Another dimension added to the construct was (d) quality of
work life. A sample item to measure (a) performance-linked
incentives includes "Whenever I do a good job, my perfor-
mance is noticed and rewarded"; (b) training and develop-
ment includes "Management in my software firm stresses the
importance of training and development"; (c) staffing
includes "Staffing process in my firm is rigid"; and (d) qual-
ity of work life includes "My company has the policy to send
employees for offshore projects." Response descriptions
against each item were given on a Likert-type scale--
strongly disagree (0) to strongly agree (4). High additive
scores of items on a dimension indicated a more favorable
evaluation of that dimension.
Value of knowledge sharing. Four items developed to measure
"value of knowledge sharing" include (1) "purpose of shar-
ing knowledge," (2) "content of sharing knowledge,"
(3) "clarity of sharing knowledge," and (4) "utility of knowledge
sharing." Response options for each item used four 10-point
bipolar adjectives--unpleasant­pleasant, harmful­beneficial,
bad­good, and worthless­valuable, respectively. High additive
scores on items indicated more knowledge sharing.
Opportunities for knowledge sharing.This was assessed on
eight items developed by Lin (2007). A sample item includes
"I take initiation to set up group meetings to exchange rele-
vant information." All positively keyed items were rated on a
5-point Likert-type scale--highly unpleasant (0) to highly
pleasant (4). High additive scores on items indicated greater
opportunities for knowledge sharing.
The convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs
were tested by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The
Amos 4.0 software package was used (Arbuckle & Wothke,
1999). We conservatively used the factor loading of an item
to be  .3 for retention in a construct. The purpose was to
identify and eliminate poorly performing items. Along with
descriptive statistics, various fit measures of comparative fit
index (CFI), goodness of fit index (GFI), normed fit index
(NFI), and root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) are given in Table 2.
Along with the validity of items, the inter-item consis-
tency of each item was reported. Barring a few dimensions
on performance (Prasad & Suar, 2010), Cronbach's alpha
reliability was acceptable in all constructs (>.60).
The mean of each variable was estimated considering the
additive score of the items on a variable and dividing that by
the number of items in that variable to keep the score within
the range of the scale. The validity of all the scales was
acceptable. CFI and GFI indices were above 0.80, except for
the dimensions on EICs. Although the constructs did not
reach ideal fit levels (0.90), the constructs could not be con-
sidered invalid because the minimum fit of the model was
achieved and the regression coefficients from the observed
variables to the latent construct were significant.
Procedure
A cross-section of 441 SPs responded to a questionnaire sur-
vey on sociodemographic variables, EICs, transformational
leadership, social capital, HRM practices, value of knowl-
edge sharing, and opportunities for knowledge sharing.
Fifty-five team leaders assessed the performance of SPs.
Results
Pearson's correlations among the studied variables (Table 3)
revealed the following relationships:
·
· Six dimensions of performance directly inter-related
among themselves significantly suggesting that the
increase in one dimension of performance went with
the increase in other dimensions of performance.
·
· Barring a few relations, dimensions of EICs including
self-awareness, self-management, social-awareness,
and relationship management varied positively with
the six dimensions of performance.
·
· The transformational leadership dimensions of inspi-
rational motivation and intellectual stimulation fre-
quently and directly increased with the six dimensions
of performance. But, idealized influence of the team
leader increased with personal resourcefulness, and
individualized consideration increased with low pro-
ductivity orientation of SPs.
·
· The social capital dimensions of group characteristics,
group norms, togetherness, trust, and reciprocity con-
sistently and positively related to the varied dimen-
sions of performance.
·
· HRM practices of performance-linked reward, train-
ing and development, staffing, and quality of work
life frequently and positively related to the varied
dimensions of performance.
·
· The proposed moderators, value of knowledge shar-
ing, and opportunities for knowledge sharing related
positively and occasionally to the dimensions of

performance, EICs, transformational leadership,
social capital, and HRM practices. Barring few excep-
tions, the reported relations supported the hypothe-
sized directions.
Latent variable structural equation modeling (LVSEM)
was adopted to test the hypotheses. LVSEM reveals anteced-
ent­consequent relationships that are unobserved in bidirec-
tional correlations. It incorporates measurement models and
structural relationships. It controls measurement errors--
(a) random and (b) systematic. Random errors occur due to
difficulties in measuring the constructs accurately. The con-
vergent and discriminant validity of each indicator variable
was established with its significant loading on the respective
latent construct using CFA. Systematic errors occur due to
factors such as social desirability, common method bias (e.g.,
scale type, rater, or context), and response biases (e.g., leni-
ency, yea-saying, or nay-saying). Systematic errors
(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2003) were controlled
procedurally, collecting data on job performance of SPs from
their team leaders and on other variables from SPs at differ-
ent time periods using different questionnaires.
In LVSEM, the standardized path coefficients are similar
to standardized beta values in multiple regression analysis.
The standardized paths from observed variables to latent
constructs were significant, suggesting that the observed
dimensions of EICs, transformational leadership, social capi-
tal, and HRM practices were measuring their latent construct.
Supporting four parts of the first hypothesis, an increase in
EICs, transformational leadership, social capital, and HRM
practices improved the job performance of SPs (Table 4).
From the standardized regression weights of all con-
structs, it was observed that EICs of SPs were the most
important antecedent to determine their job performance.
The standardized regression weight of EICs alone was about
2 times greater than the combined standardized regression
weights of transformational leadership, social capital, and
HRM practices (Figure 2).
To test the second hypothesis depicting moderator effects,
two groups of structural equation modeling were performed
using median split samples for value of and opportunities for
knowledge sharing because each moderator was an observed
variable. The same structural equation modeling as shown in
Figure 2 was estimated for high (above median) and low

(below median) sample groups on two moderators. For a
more rigorous comparison, two tests for each high and low
group were conducted for each moderating variable, based
on four corresponding models A, B, C, and D proposed by
Dabholkar and Bagozzi (2002). Four models using SEM
were constrained in terms of error variances explained by
latent variables and path coefficients among latent con-
structs. Model A was constrained to be the same across high
and low groups in error variances and path coefficients. In
Model B, only error variances were constrained and in Model
D only path coefficients were constrained. With regard to
Model C, both path coefficients and error variances were free
across the two groups. Comparing the constrained with free
models, if the 2 differs significantly between models such as
A and B (or C and D), this could be from path coefficients
and if the 2 differs between A and D (or B and C), this could
be from error variances in the dependent variable. Therefore,
if the variable of interest is a true moderator, Models A and B
(or C and D) should be significantly different.
According to the results, 2 differences between pairs of
given models indicated that there were significant differ-
ences between Models A and B on value of knowledge shar-
ing and opportunities for knowledge sharing for both the
high and low groups (Table 5). This suggested the presence
of moderating effects.
Testing was carried out to verify whether the changes in
coefficients were due to group differences and not due to
measurement error. If the chi-square difference between the
high and low groups divided by the change in degree of free-
dom (2 / df) was significant, then there were significant
moderating effects across the low and high groups. The high
and low groups on value of and opportunities for knowledge
sharing differed significantly because the 2 difference for
one degree of freedom was significant. Thus, the moderators
at high and low values affected differently the antecedent­
consequent relationships (Table 6). Only after obtaining evi-
dence of this, standardized regression weights were compared
across the high and low group levels.
Prasad et al. 11
The path coefficients suggested that with high values of
knowledge sharing and opportunities for knowledge sharing,
it followed that EICs, transformational style, social capital,
and HRM practices influencing performance were strength-
ened, and with low values of knowledge sharing and oppor-
tunities for knowledge sharing, such relationships were
attenuated or nullified. Value of knowledge sharing varied
directly with performance dimensions of personal resource-
fulness and timeliness, and opportunities for knowledge
sharing positively related to performance dimensions of
work-efficiency, productivity orientation, timeliness, and
business intelligence. Because value of knowledge sharing
and opportunities for knowledge sharing varied positively
with the dimensions of performance (Sharma, Durand,
& Gur-Arie, 1981), they were quasi/partial moderators
(Table 7). These findings supported the four components of
the second hypothesis.
The full hypothesized model stating the relations between
the antecedents and consequences along with the moderators
is shown in Figure 3.

Discussion
This study aimed to find the determinants and moderators of
SPs' performance. Findings suggest that EICs of SPs, trans-
formational leadership style of team leaders, social capital
among SPs, and HRM practices provided by software firms
increased SPs' performance. EICs of SPs were found to be
the most important predictor of performance. EICs, transfor-
mational leadership, social capital, and HRM practices influ-
encing job performance were strengthened (attenuated or
nullified), under high (low) value of and opportunities for
knowledge sharing.
Antecedents of Performance
Job performance of SPs is the criterion that guides decisions
on their training, coaching, counseling, participation, trans-
fer, promotion, pay-rise, and even demotion and lay-off. If
the SPs evaluate their performance, they are more likely to
over-rate themselves. Accordingly, the team leader evaluated
the performance of SPs in his or her team. In earlier studies
(Chi & Pan, 2012; Rich et al., 2010; Titu & Constantin,
2012), supervisors similarly evaluated the performance of
subordinates' on a set of behaviors including core job tasks.
This procedure arrested common method bias because the
performance of SPs was assessed by team leaders at a differ-
ent time compared with the responses of SPs to other con-
structs of the study.
Corroborating earlier findings that job performance is
determined more by emotional intelligence than cognitive
intelligence (Boyatzis & Sala, 2004; Cherniss & Goleman,
2001; Goleman, 1998; McClelland, 1998), findings of this
study suggest that SPs having high EICs are better perform-
ers. The model suggests that SPs with high EICs show
behavior consistent with job demands when the job and orga-
nizational environment call for high job performance
(Boyatzis, 1982). Self-awareness and self-managerial skills
tune the SPs emotional framework to be adjustive, resilient,
and responsive to customers' demands. This intra-personal
competency includes not only personal attributes of confi-
dence, optimism, proactivity, self-control, emotional matu-
rity, and tolerance for ambiguity but also contextual
facilitative attributes of strategic goal-setting, team building,
and customer focus. All these in tandem increase
job performance. SPs with more inter-personal competency
better synchronize their self-generated emotions with emo-
tions of peers, clients, and team leaders. Empathizing with
peers during pause-periods helps SPs to overcome fatigue
and focus more on software quality. SPs' emotional attach-
ment with clients on successive interactions inspires rework-
ing software products to satisfy clients. An emotional
affection in the workplace helps cultivate organizational and
cultural etiquettes when dealing with clients from different
ethnic and religious backgrounds.
The findings concur with the earlier results that SPs writ-
ing open source code increased their job performance work-
ing under transformational team leaders (Li, Tan, & Teo,
2012). Informal discussion with the SPs revealed that their
team leaders were senior to them. They and their team lead-
ers had worked as colleagues in the past. The team leaders
influenced colleagues and juniors to achieve project objec-
tives. Through their deeds, they were able to mobilize the
juniors, build trust, and bring the SPs'talent to the surface for
achieving goals of projects vis-à-vis software firms.
The model further suggests that SPs become confident,
achievement driven, and courageously take up challenging
tasks of software development under transformational team
leaders. Team leaders enhance SPs' effectiveness encourag-
ing innovative ways to do the job, inspiring and elevating
them to a higher plane, and removing deficiencies through
teaching, training, and counseling. SPs can withstand the
challenges posed by clients' requirements because the team
leaders have intellectually stimulated and encouraged SPs to
think critically and do the job in novel ways. This is parallel
to the "Pygmalion effect." The team leader inspires, stimu-
lates, and expects higher performance from SPs, and SPs
perform accordingly.
The model also suggests that SPs overcome the pressure
of performance through cooperation, mutual support, and
networking with others (Taeube, 2005). They practice togeth-
erness with colleagues and peers, interacting with them and
collecting insightful information about the project that helps
improve performance. With freedom of expression and inter-
action with talented engineers, SPs improve their knowledge
about how to contribute to the project.

SPs to work hard in meeting deadlines and fulfilling the
needs of clients. SPs conscientiously attend training and
development programs offered by the firm to improve their
domain expertise and multi-skilling abilities. Performance-
linked incentives reinforce engagement in work activities,
offering excellent services to the clients/customers, adhering
to norms of firms, and bringing discipline to the workplace.
The staffing function hires the right people to handle the job.
Through staffing, SPs design more bug-free and more agile
programs with appropriate lines of code. The top manage-
ments of software firms are quick to respond to needs of
employees about quality workplace. A case in point is the
Microsoft Company (Redmond, USA). SPs are given a free
hand to purchase and place orders for any item that they con-
sider essential to improve the quality of the workplace with-
out hierarchical hassles (Microsoft, 2006). If the SPs are
more reciprocated, satisfied, trained, and provided incentive
in accordance with performance, they are more likely to
meet clients' requirements. When the needs of SPs' are met
in a conducive work environment, their performance
increases to meet the requirements of external clients (Kotler,
1994).
Cognitive intelligence assesses analytical and language
abilities. Although it can ensure quality and quantity of per-
formance, SPs are less likely to vary in it because they have
to continuously pass through a series of such tests. Supporting
the observation of Boyatzis et al. (2000), EICs are found to
be the most important predictor of job performance.
Moderators of Performance
Value of and opportunities for knowledge sharing make the
exchange of knowledge easier among SPs (Minbaeva, 2008).
Opportunities for knowledge sharing have reciprocally ben-
efited the individual employees as well as others in innova-
tion and idea generation. Under favorable conditions, EICs,
transformational leadership style, social capital, and HRM
practices have increased performance. Contrarily, when such
favorable conditions are lower, the antecedents have attenu-
ated or nullified their relationship with job performance.
Implications and Limitations
This study contributes to current knowledge of variables
affecting SPs' performance, and it has implications for the
workplace. EICs are found to be the most important predic-
tor of performance. In addition, EICs, transformational lead-
ership style, social capital, and HRM practices influencing
the SPs' performance can further improve performance with
high value of and more opportunities for knowledge sharing.
While recruiting and selecting potential SPs, a HR manager
can select those having high EICs to maximize workplace

performance. After recruitment and selection, fine-tuning the
leadership style, and improving social capital and HRM
practices can further boost performance. Moreover, aware-
ness about the value of knowledge sharing in complex soft-
ware projects and exchange of work-related information
through group discussions, blog, networking, You Tube, and
Facebook can help SPs to augment their knowledge vis-à-vis
performance.
There are certain limitations of this study. First, the indi-
vidual level construct of EICs of 441 SPs, the group level
construct of transformational leadership and social capital
of 55 teams, and the enterprise level construct of HRM prac-
tices of eight firms call for a multi-level statistical analysis.
However, the relatively small number of companies could
not yield sufficient statistical power to conduct a three-level
analysis. However, depending on group members' behav-
iors, including communication, politics, and conflicts, the
perception of leadership style, social capital, and HRM
practices will vary from one SP to another. Moreover, job
performance, the outcome construct of the study, was
assessed individually. Therefore, the SP was the unit of
analysis.
Second, the data have been collected from IT hubs at
Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata in India. Moreover, the
LVSEM includes five latent variables studied through 27
observed variables (Note: Four for EICs, four for transfor-
mational leadership style, seven for social capital, four for
HRM practices, and six for performance. In addition, there is
one observed variable for value of knowledge sharing and
another for opportunities for knowledge sharing.). Estimating
the sample-size (Soper, 2013; Westland, 2010) for 5 latent
and 27 observed variables requires a minimum of 463
respondents if one wishes to detect effects with a statistical
power level of .8 and with a small effect-size of .10 (Cohen,
1988), and a minimum of 129 respondents for the structure
of the model. Although the sample-size is adequate for the
structural model, LVSEM falls short by 22 respondents to
detect effects. Therefore, caution must be exercised in gener-
alizing the findings.
Conclusion
Reviewing the literature from individualistic Euro-American
cultures, a model of SPs'performance was proposed specify-
ing the antecedents and facilitators of performance. Analysis
of information collected from the collectivist culture of
Indian SPs supports the model suggesting its cross-cultural
validity and application in work settings.
Extending Goleman's (1995) proposition, transforma-
tional leadership, social capital, and HRM practices in soft-
ware firms along with SPs' EICs are found to improve the
performance of SPs. Such relationships are also found to be
elevated under high values of and opportunities for knowl-
edge sharing.
