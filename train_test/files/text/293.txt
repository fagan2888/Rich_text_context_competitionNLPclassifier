Background. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) causes Kaposi sarcoma. In the United States, transmission routes
for HHV-8 are uncertain.
Methods. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III sampled individuals from the US general
population (1988­1994). We used enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) to measure HHV-8 antibodies (K8.1 and open
reading frame [ORF] 73 antigens) in 13,894 surveyed adults. HHV-8 seroprevalence was examined according to
sexual history and viral coinfection markers.
Results. Overall, seroprevalence was low when a highly specific cutoff was used (K8.1, 1.6%; ORF73, 1.5%)
but was higher when a less-specific cutoff was used (K8.1, 7.1%; ORF73, 7.4%). When the more-specific approach
was used, K8.1 seroprevalence was similar in men and women. Men who have sex with men (MSM) had a higher
K8.1 seroprevalence (8.2%). Among other men, K8.1 seroprevalence was marginally associated with duration of
heterosexual activity ( ) and was positively associated with the lifetime number of sex partners ( )

and with coinfections with hepatitis B virus (6.1% vs. 1.2% without coinfection; ) and herpes simplex

virus 2 (2.7% vs. 1.0%; ). Among women, K8.1 seroprevalence was not significantly related to duration
P p .003
of sexual activity, the lifetime number of sex partners, or viral coinfections. The ORF73 EIA revealed similar but
less clear-cut patterns.
Conclusions. Among men, HHV-8 transmission may occur through sexual activity, particularly sex with other
men. No evidence was observed for heterosexual transmission to women.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is the etiologic agent
of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a malignancy that occurs at
greatly increased incidence in persons coinfected with
HIV [1­4]. HHV-8 in the United States and western
Europe is highly prevalent among men who have sex

with men (MSM), with seroprevalence estimates rang-
ing from 20% to 60% [4­6], and the relationship with
the number of recent male sex partners is consistent
with transmission through intimate contact between
men. Evidence for heterosexual transmission has been
less consistent [7­10]. The exact mechanism by which
the virus is conveyed between hosts is uncertain. HHV-
8 is frequently shed in saliva from infected individuals
and is found less commonly and at lower levels in
genital secretions [11­13].
The epidemiology of HHV-8 infection in the general
US population remains unknown. Most previous epi-
demiological studies of HHV-8 in the United States
have focused on groups at the highest risk for HIV
infection, including MSM [4, 5] and injection drug
users [14­16]. HHV-8 seroprevalence appears to be low
among US blood donors (2%­5%) [17, 18], but blood
donors are screened for various infectious diseases and

are therefore a select group. There have been no studies eval-
uating risk factors for infection in the general US population.
Furthermore, studies have used varying HHV-8 assays with
differing or uncertain sensitivity and specificity [17, 19], making
comparisons across studies and populations problematic. Thus,
further data on the epidemiology of HHV-8 in the United States
would be valuable.
In the present study, we used serum samples and data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) III--a large, population-based, cross-sectional
study--to study the epidemiology of HHV-8 in the US general
adult population. We describe evidence of sexual transmission
of this virus among US men.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
NHANES, which is conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics, US Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, is a series of cross-sectional surveys that provide national
statistics on the health and nutritional status of the US non-
institutionalized civilian population through household inter-
views, standardized physical examinations, and collection of
biological samples at special mobile examination centers [20].
NHANES III was conducted during 1988­1994 and included
39,365 individuals randomly sampled through a complex, mul-
tistage probability design [20]. Specific subgroups were over-
sampled, including children, elderly persons, non-Hispanic
blacks, and Mexican Americans.
The present article describes data on adults aged 18 years or
older from NHANES III (figure 1). Of 19,618 adult NHANES
III participants, 17,295 were examined and 16,923 had a phle-
botomy performed. We performed HHV-8 antibody testing on
13,894 subjects with available remaining serum samples.
Laboratory methods. HHV-8 antibody testing was per-
formed using EIAs to detect antibodies to the HHV-8 K8.1
structural glycoprotein (expressed during lytic viral replication)
and open reading frame (ORF) 73 (also known as latency-
associated nuclear antigen, a viral regulatory protein expressed
during latent infection). Serum samples were diluted 1:20 for
the K8.1 EIA and 1:100 for the ORF73 EIA. EIA methods have
been detailed elsewhere [21]. We measured both K8.1 and
ORF73 antibodies because some infected individuals, includ-
ing those with KS, make antibodies only to lytic or latent
antigens [22].
HHV-8 testing was conducted over a period of 6 months.
Quality control criteria determined an acceptable range for var-
iation in the controls, and plates that had control optical density
values outside the acceptable range were repeated. Nonetheless,
there was noticeable plate-to-plate variability in the EIA optical
density results for the positive controls on each plate and, in
parallel, in the mean optical density value for samples tested
on each plate. To account for this plate-to-plate variability, we
Epidemiology of Human Herpesvirus 8 · JID 2007:196 (15 July) · 201
adjusted the optical density results for samples by regressing
them against the mean optical density of the positive controls
on the respective plate. The regression equations were as fol-
lows:
sample positivecontrol
OD p 0.109 + 0.169OD + R ,
ij i ij
for the K8.1 assay, and
sample positivecontrol
OD p 0.128 + 0.169OD + R ,
ij i ij
for the ORF73 assay, where i denotes the plate, j denotes the
sample, and Rij
is the residual from the regressions. A sample's
residual Rij
value can be interpreted as the amount that the
sample's optical density was above or below the expected value
for that plate. For most samples, these residuals clustered in a
single peak with low antibody levels, although there was a mi-
nority of individuals who had higher reactivity. After visual
inspection of histograms of the residuals, we chose cutoffs for
the residuals (1.20 for the K8.1 assay and 0.70 for the ORF73
assay), with subjects whose residuals were above the cutoff
classified as seropositive. The cutoffs chosen from the regression
were highly conservative, to increase the specificity of the EIAs
and to enhance the positive predictive value of the test results.
As a consequence, seroprevalence results may underestimate
the true prevalence of HHV-8 infection, but comparisons of
results across groups should be valid. In a sensitivity analysis,
we used cutoffs for these EIAs that we had used previously: for
the K8.1 EIA, the cutoff was ; for the

yielded higher seroprevalence estimates but did not fully ac-
count for the plate-to-plate variability captured by the regres-
sion method.
Laboratory testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C
virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV)­1, HSV-2, and hu-
man papillomavirus (HPV)­16 was performed as described
elsewhere [23­27]. Antibodies to HBV core antigen were de-
tected by radioimmunoassay [25]. Samples were tested for HCV
infection with a second-generation EIA and a supplemental test
[23]. The presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection was assessed
using immunodot assays for viral gG1 and gG2 glycoproteins,
respectively [24, 26]. HPV-16 testing, which was limited to
participants !60 years old from phase 2 of NHANES III (1991­
1994), was performed using a virus-like particle EIA [27].
Statistical methods. We examined HHV-8 seroprevalence
in the total population and in subgroups of NHANES III sub-
jects. These analyses considered each EIA separately, to account
for biological variability in serological responses; for compar-
ison, we also present an overall estimate of seroprevalencebased
on positivity on either EIA. The primary analyses used the
cutoffs chosen on the basis of our regression method, but, in
a sensitivity analysis, we also examined seroprevalence based
on prior cutoffs.
HHV-8 seroprevalence estimates were weighted according to
the NHANES III sampling scheme, to provide unbiased esti-
mates for the total US population and specific demographic
subgroups. However, adult NHANES III participants lacking
serum samples for our study were older than the included
subjects and differed from them by sex and race/ethnicity (data
not shown). Because these differences could have introduced
bias, we generated a new set of sample weights by poststratifying
the standard NHANES III sample weights, so that the new
weighted totals by age, sex, and race/ethnicity matched cor-
responding totals for the US population [28]. All analyses used
these new sample weights.
We report HHV-8 seroprevalence data for specific subgroups
of NHANES III subjects. Subjects with missing data were ex-
cluded. Race/ethnicity was defined as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Mexican American; persons not fitting
these categories were still included in the total population. We
examined HHV-8 seroprevalence according to markers of sex-
ual activity separately for men and women, because preliminary
analyses revealed important differences by sex. All participants
17­59 years old were asked questions regarding sexual history
in a face-to-face interview. Questioning began with, "At what
age did you first have sexual intercourse?" and, for subjects
who had had intercourse, "With how many different partners
have you ever had sexual intercourse?" Men were further asked
how many of these partners were male. We considered MSM
activity to be present if a man reported at least 1 male sex
partner. We examined seroprevalence according to the duration
of sexual activity, lifetime number of sex partners, and MSM
activity. Among sexually active adults, the duration of sexual
activity (0­20, 21­30, 31­40, and 41 years) was calculated as
the current age minus the age at first reported sexual activity.
The lifetime number of sex partners was categorized into quar-
tiles (1, 2­4, 5­9, and 10). Finally, we examined HHV-8 se-
roprevalence according to coinfection with viruses considered
to be transmitted sexually (HBV, HSV-2, and HPV-16), sexually
or through other intimate contact (HSV-1), and through par-
enteral exposures such as injection drug use (HCV).
SUDAAN (release 9.0.1; Research Triangle Institute), a sta-
tistical package for analyzing complex survey data with mul-
tistage sampling, was used for analysis. We calculated sero-
prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the
basis of the logit method. P values for differences in seroprev-
alence across groups were derived from the Wald F test from
logistic regression models. Tests of trend across categories were
performed using logistic regression by assigning increasing in-
teger values to increasing levels of the categories. Because we
were concerned that small numbers could affect the validity of
these P values, we checked them using a quasi-score test [29],
202 · JID 2007:196 (15 July) · Engels et al.
and these agreed. We examined associations with markers of
sexual activity separately for men and women, adjusting for
age (in 5 categories, treated as an ordinal variable) as a potential
confounder.
RESULTS
Using a highly specific assay cutoff, 307 of 13,984 adult subjects
were K8.1 seropositive, yielding a seroprevalence estimate of
1.6% (95% CI, 1.4%­1.9%). Likewise, there were 238 individ-
uals who were ORF73 seropositive according to a specific cutoff,
yielding similar seroprevalence (1.5% [95% CI, 1.1%­1.8%]).
There were 436 individuals seropositive on either assay, cor-
responding to a seroprevalence of 2.5% (95% CI, 2.2%­3.0%).
A total of 109 individuals were seropositive on both assays
( ).
k p 0.39
As noted in Subjects and Methods, in a sensitivity analysis,
we also calculated seroprevalence using previous assay cutoffs.
In that approach, the overall seroprevalence was substantially
higher (K8.1 seroprevalence, 7.1%; ORF73 seroprevalence,7.4%).
Demographic patterns in K8.1 and ORF73 seroprevalence
are shown in table 1, using the highly specific cutoffs chosen
after standardizing EIA results for plate-to-plate variability.
K8.1 seroprevalence increased with age, from 0.6% among those
18­30 years old to 2.6% among those 60 years old (P !
). K8.1 seroprevalence was higher among non-Hispanic
.001
blacks (2.1%) and Mexican Americans (2.1%) than among
non-Hispanic whites (1.5%). K8.1 seroprevalence decreased
with level of education ( ) and, in the comparison of
P p .002
marital status, was higher in individuals who were widowed or
separated/divorced than in those who were married or never
married ( ). K8.1 seroprevalence was also higher in
P p .002
individuals living in households with incomes below the US
poverty level than in those at or above the poverty level
( ). K8.1 seroprevalence was the same in men and
P p .01
women ( ) and did not vary by place of birth (table 1).
P p .7
Patterns for ORF73 seroprevalence were similar to those for
K8.1 seroprevalence, but differences across subgroups were less
distinct and did not reach statistical significance (table 1).
Data on sexual partnerships were available for 4173 (94.5%)
of 4414 men !60 years old. Of these, 69 reported a history of
MSM activity (weighted prevalence, 1.9% among all men [95%
CI, 1.2%­3.0%]). The median number of reported male part-
ners was 4 (interquartile range, 2­15). K8.1 seroprevalence was
substantially higher in this small group of MSM than in men
!60 years old who did not report a history of MSM activity
(8.2% vs. 1.3%; ). A less-pronounced difference was
P p .005
seen in ORF73 seroprevalence (3.3% vs. 1.6%; ). When
P p .4
the previous assay cutoffs were used, each assay yielded higher
seroprevalence in MSM (25.2% by the K8.1 EIA and 18.4% by
the ORF73 EIA).
We next examined patterns in HHV-8 seroprevalence ac-
cording to sexual history and markers of other viral infections.
Results are shown separately for men (excluding 69 MSM; table
2) and women (table 3), again when assay cutoffs with high
specificity were used. Results were similar to those in table 2
when we excluded older men (who were not asked about sexual
history) or other men for whom data on MSM activity were
missing (data not shown).
Among men (table 2), K8.1 seroprevalence increased with
the duration of heterosexual activity ( ) and lifetime

number of heterosexual partners ( ), although these

trends were not strong and were reduced in significance after
adjustment for age ( and , respectively). K8.1

serostatus was associated with coinfections with HBV (K8.1
seroprevalence, 6.1% in subjects with coinfection vs. 1.2% in
subjects without coinfection; ), HSV-1 (1.9% vs. 0.2%;
P ! .0001
), and HSV-2 (2.7% vs. 1.0%; ). These asso-
P ! .001 P p .002
ciations remained significant after age adjustment. K8.1 sero-
status was not associated with HCV or HPV-16 coinfection.
Among women (table 3), K8.1 seroprevalence did not in-
crease significantly with either duration of sexual activity or
lifetime number of sex partners, but seroprevalence was rela-
tively high (4.6%) among the few women reporting no prior
sexual activity. The 5 K8.1-seropositive women who reported
no prior sexual activity ranged in age from 18 to 59 years, and
all were unmarried; 2 were coinfected with HSV-1, but oth-
erwise all were uninfected with the other viruses considered.
Overall, K8.1 seroprevalence in women was nonsignificantly
elevated in women coinfected with HSV-1 (1.7% vs. 0.9%;
) or HSV-2 (2.0% vs. 1.2%; ) but was not elevated

at all in women coinfected with HBV (1.6% vs. 1.5%; ).

K8.1 serostatus was not associated with HCV or HPV-16
coinfection.
To some extent, patterns in ORF73 seroprevalence for men
and women mirrored those for K8.1 seroprevalence, although
they were less pronounced (tables 2 and 3). In men, ORF73
seroprevalence was lower in HCV-infected subjects than in un-
infected subjects ( ), but this association was not sig-

nificant in women. In both men and women, ORF73 se-
roprevalence was positively associated with HBV coinfection
(4.8% vs. 1.3% [ ] and 3.1% vs. 1.2% [ ], re-

spectively). Among women, there were nonsignificant inverse
associations with HSV-1 and HSV-2 coinfection (table 3).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to systematically
evaluate the epidemiology of HHV-8 in the general US pop-
ulation. We used 2 different assays to independently measure
antibodies to HHV-8 proteins expressed in lytic or latent in-
fection. An important finding was the association between
HHV-8 serostatus and markers of sexual risk behaviors among
men.

a Test for trend.
As expected, we found that HHV-8 infection was especially
frequent among MSM (when highly specific assay cutoffs were
used: K8.1 seroprevalence, 8.6%; ORF73 seroprevalence, 3.4%).
Among MSM, HHV-8 seroprevalence increases with the num-
ber of previous male partners [4­6, 30], but the particular acts
responsible for HHV-8 transmission among MSM are uncertain
[31]. HHV-8 seroprevalence was noticeably lower among MSM
in our study than in prior studies (20%­60%) [4­6, 9, 30]. A
likely explanation is the high specificity of the assay cutoffs that
we relied on. Indeed, HHV-8 seroprevalence in MSM was ma-
terially higher when we used our prior cutoffs. Another expla-
nation could be the recruitment of men in NHANES III from

atively few male partners (e.g., a median of 4 lifetime partners
among NHANES MSM vs. a median of 6­10 partners during
the preceding 2 years among MSM in the study by Martin et
al. [4]). Likewise, men in the general population who report
MSM activity may engage in less-risky types of behavior than
those considered typical for MSM in prior studies (e.g., atten-
dance at "bath houses" or the use of stimulant drugs).

Even among US males who did not admit to prior MSM
activity, HHV-8 seroprevalence was positively associated with
markers of sexual activity, such as the lifetime number sex
partners and coinfection with the sexually transmitted viruses
HBV, HSV-1, and HSV-2. These associations might arise be-
cause of the heterosexual transmission of HHV-8 to men. How-
ever, it is equally plausible that our findings reflect unreported
MSM activity. In NHANES III, questions regarding sexual ac-
tivity were asked in a face-to-face interview, and the proportion
of men who reported prior sexual activity with other men (1.9%
206 · JID 2007:196 (15 July) · Engels et al.
[95% CI, 1.2%­3.0%]) was lower than suggested by recent
surveys (4.7%) [32]. It is therefore not possible to rule out that
underreporting of MSM activity by NHANES III males ac-
counts for the observed associations with markers of sexual
activity among men.
Interestingly, we did not find evidence that HHV-8 sero-
prevalence was associated with these same markers of sexual
activity among women. Both women and men could have un-
derreported their sexual history, which might have obscured
an association with sexual transmission. Nonetheless, HHV-8
was only weakly associated with HSV-2 in female subjects, even
though HSV-2 is sexually transmitted and a clear relationship
between HSV-2 and sexual history is present in women in
NHANES III [24].
Existing data on heterosexual transmission of HHV-8 are
inconclusive. One prior study of male and female attendees at
a sexually transmitted disease clinic found no association be-
tween HHV-8 infection and number of recent partners [9].
Studies of HIV-infected men and prostitutes also have provided
no evidence for heterosexual transmission of HHV-8 [7­9, 33],
although the studies were limited by small size. Interestingly,
in 2 high-risk cohorts of US women, HHV-8 serostatus was
positively associated with HIV infection and a history of other
sexually transmitted infections but was not related to the life-
time number of male sex partners or prior sex with a bisexual
man [10, 34]. In support of heterosexual transmission of HHV-
8 to US women, KS risk is especially high among HIV-infected
women who acquire HIV (and, presumably, HHV-8) from a
bisexual man [35].
Ways by which HHV-8 could be transmitted sexually are
uncertain. HHV-8 is frequently shed in saliva from infected
individuals [11], raising the possibility of direct oral transmis-
sion (e.g., by kissing). Among homosexual men, HHV-8 in-
fection is strongly associated with a recent history of oral or
anal sex [5, 30], which may involve contact of saliva with the
insertive partner's penis. Given the associations that we ob-
served with markers of sexual activity among men but not
women, it is possible that HHV-8 is spread heterosexually to
men through similar acts between a man and his infected female
sex partner.
We also observed differences in HHV-8 seroprevalence by
race/ethnicity, education level, marital status, and household
income. The elevated seroprevalence among blacks and Mex-
ican Americans and among those with lower education level
and household income could reflect environmental conditions
(e.g., crowding and inadequate nutrition) associated with lower
socioeconomic status and conducive to HHV-8 transmission
by as-yet-undefined mechanisms [36]. HHV-8 is transmitted
within families in areas of high endemicity [37], and such trans-
mission might occur in the United States as well.
Each HHV-8 assay separately yielded an overall estimate of
1.5%­1.6% seroprevalence in US adults and, considering the
presence of antibodies on either assay to indicate infection,
provided an upper estimate of 2.5%. Although the presence of
antibody to HHV-8 might thus appear to be somewhat un-
common, we are reluctant to emphasize this result as an es-
timate of the prevalence of HHV-8 infection among US adults.
A general limitation of studies of the epidemiology of HHV-8
is the lack of a standard serological assay for infection. We
deliberately chose cutoffs for the EIAs that yielded a high pre-
dictive value for positive results. In the end, this approach was
supported by the demonstration of clear associations of K8.1
antibody results with demographic and sexual risk factors. Also,
although the results with the ORF73 EIA were less definitive,
the level of agreement between the 2 assays appeared to be
reasonable ( ). However, our approach to standardizing
k p 0.39
optical density measurements across plates has not been vali-
dated, and we could have underestimated the prevalence of
infection. A sensitivity analysis using an alternative approach
for determining seropositivity, with our previous cutoffs,
yielded substantially higher seroprevalence estimates. However,
we did not rely on this analysis, because it did not fully account
for the observed plate-to-plate variability in EIA results and
because the specificity (and thus the false-positive rate) was
uncertain.
An additional limitation is that the seroprevalence estimates
and associations for some groups (e.g., HCV-infected indi-
viduals) were based on small numbers of NHANES III sub-
jects. Although the CIs and P values reflect the statistical un-
certainty, we caution against overinterpreting these results.
Finally, NHANES III lacks data on sexual practices, which pre-
vented us from exploring potential routes of sexual transmis-
sion in more detail.
In conclusion, our study provides population-based epide-
miological data about the determinants of HHV-8 serostatus
in US adults. Our results suggest that HHV-8 infection is in-
creased in relation to markers of sexual activity among men.
Additional research may further clarify transmission routes,
which would ultimately help the development of interventions
that prevent infection.
