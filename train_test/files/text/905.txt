Objectives. We examine the relationship between living arrangements and multiple measures of physical, cognitive, and
emotional functioning in late midlife.
Methods. Using cross-sectional data from the Health and Retirement Study, we first assess the bivariate relationship be-
tween living arrangements and functioning; we then take into account demographic characteristics and measures of household
resources and demands.
Results. Wefindevidence of differential functioning among individuals in various living arrangements. Married couples liv-
ing alone or with children show the highest levels of functioning, whereas single adults living in complex households show the
lowest levels. Functional deficits for those in complex households are reduced but not eliminated when we take demographic
characteristics and household resources and demands into account. We find few differences by gender and race/ethnicity in the
relationship between living arrangements and functioning.
Discussion. We show a pattern of poorer functioning among those in arguably the most demanding and least supportive
household environments. This points to a vulnerable andrisk-filledtransition from middle to old age for these persons. Because
Blacks and Hispanics show lower levels of functioning than Whites and are more likely to live in complex households, they
may be particularly disadvantaged.
TN middle through early older ages, people live in diverse fam-
1. ily structures (Siegel, 1993). A large proportion of adults in
their 50s and 60s are "empty nesters," living only with their
spouses. Others live with their children--some with their
spouses and children, some with their children only, and some
in complex households including their spouses, children, and
other relatives. A sizeable minority of persons in this age group
lives alone; a smaller minority lives with a cohabiting partner.
Finally, a modest but significant number live without spouse or
children in complex households. As in other stages of the life
course, these patterns differ by race and ethnicity. Single-parent
families and multigenerational households are both more com-
mon among older Blacks and Hispanics than among older
Whites (Himes, Hogan, & Eggebeen, 1996).
The various household structures make very different de-
mands on the adults in them and offer very different levels and
types of resources. These differences may have implications for
the well-being of adults at the threshold of old age. Although
most middle-aged adults remain healthy and continue to func-
tion at high levels, in late middle age some people begin to ex-
perience functional limitations associated with aging (Jette,
1996). Impaired functioning among those living indepen-
dently--or those on whom others are dependent--points to an
increased risk of transition to disability and suggests a potential
unmet need for support.
In this article, we consider the household as a specific and im-
portant context in which functional limitations may create prob-
lems for older adults. Using the Health and Retirement Study,
we examine the cross-sectional relationship between household
structure and levels of physical, emotional, and cognitive func-
tioning for a group of adults poised to become young-old.
Background
Recent conceptualizations of the disablement process have
defined functional capacity as an individual's inherent capability
to perform fundamental physical, emotional, or mental actions
(Verbrugge & Jette, 1994; World Health Organization, 1997).
The notion of functional capacity is intended to separate generic,
situation-free actions, such as walking, lifting heavy objects,
climbing stairs, normal affect, and short-term memory from
more complex, situation-dependent activities, such as household
maintenance, cooking, or bathing (Verbrugge & Jette, 1994).
Functional limitations--restrictions in performing such fun-
damental actions--constitute a key step in the disablement pro-
cess. In this perspective, disability reflects "the expression of a
functional limitation in a social context--the gap between a
person's capabilities and the demands of the environment"
(Pope & Tarlov, 1991, p.81). This view is similar to Lawton's
(1982) notion of "competence" or physical, mental, and emo-
tional capabilities of individuals, which combines with "envi-
ronmental press" to affect behavior. Other conceptions have
also highlighted the importance of the social and built environ-
ments in shaping the aging experience (Golant, 1984; Moos,
1996; Regnier & Pynoos, 1987).
Each of these frameworks suggests that the development of
problems with age, especially disability, is critically dependent
S136
LIVINGARRANGEMENTSAND FUNCTIONAL STATUS S137
upon the relationship between an individual's functional status and
his or her environment. Aging individuals live and act in many
overlapping environments. Of these, the household presents the en-
vironment that a person must negotiate on a daily basis to fulfill
basic needs. By household, we refer both to household composi-
tion--the number and identity of persons in the household--and
to the physical features of the dwelling (Burch & Matthews, 1987).
The centrality of the household follows from a number of its
features. First, the household is the repository of critical social
roles--notjust self-care and household maintenance, but also
roles such as spouse, parent, and grandparent (Verbrugge & Jette,
1994). Second, the presence and types of others in the household
not only determines the roles a person expects and is expected to
fill, but they also determine the particular task demands associ-
ated with a role and the potential for change in these obligations
in the face of functional limitations. The tasks embodied in social
roles make physical, cognitive, and emotional demands on role
incumbents; however, others in the household may constitute a
resource, taking over tasks that a functionally impaired individual
is not able to do. Third, household others form the principal web
of interactions for the aging person. The attitudes and motiva-
tions of the person and the others surrounding him or her shape
the individual's response to functional limitations (Nagi, 1965).
Finally, quite apart from the inhabitants of the household, the
characteristics of the dwelling shape the residential environment
of the aging person (Golant, 1992; Lawton, 1990). As often dis-
cussed, the size of the dwelling, whether it has stairs, and the ex-
tent to which it is suited for special needs define the demands that
residents face in accomplishing day-to-day tasks (Czaja, Weber,
& Nair, 1993; Satariano, 1997).
Each household type contains a distinct configuration of de-
mands and resources. For example, being married brings the de-
mands of the spousal role, but a member of a married couple
may rely on a spouse tofillin gaps left by functional limitations.
The particular closeness of marital relationships may make the
adjustment especially successful. In contrast, although persons
living alone have no demands placed on them by others, they
have no one to compensate for any functional limitations. The
person living alone must fulfill all of the requirements of inde-
pendent living and lacks the instrumental and emotional support
from others that might mitigate a functional limitation.
A more complex case is presented by multigenerational house-
holds. Coresidence with children, grandchildren, or others may
be a response to economic hardship or may reflect cultural tradi-
tions that emphasize kin solidarity and intergenerational ties
(Himes et al., 1996). Recent research suggests that intergenera-
tional households are most often based on the needs of the
younger generations (Aquilino, 1990; Ward, Logan, & Spitze,
1992). Thus although these households are often expected to be
uniquely supportive, they may actually present special stresses
and challenges to senior members with functional limitations.
The importance of extended household structures among minor-
ity individuals, especially those living in poverty, suggests that
this is a critical issue (Bengtson, Rosenthal, & Burton, 1996).
Research Questions
Our aim is to examine the cross-sectional relationship be-
tween living arrangements and functional limitations in a rela-
tively youthful sample to assess the relevance of the household
as a context for aging. We address four questions.
First, do adults living in different types of households differ in
levels of physical, cognitive, and emotional functioning? Adults
in their 50s and 60s live in a variety of households. Although
most are healthy, some show moderate to substantial deficits in
functioning on some dimensions. Do those in the least support-
ive and/or most demanding types of households show higher
levels of functioning than those in other households? How do
known influences of household composition on health translate
into differences in functional status by living arrangement?
Second, to what extent are any deficits in functioning among
middle-aged adults in certain living arrangements accounted for
by their other characteristics? The likelihood of both functional
limitations and widowhood increase with age (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1996). Older men are substantially less likely than
older women to live alone and show lower prevalence of limita-
tions (Siegel, 1993). Blacks are more likely than Whites to be
single-adult heads of families and are more likely to have func-
tional limitations (Schoenbaum & Waidman, 1997; U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1996). We compare the association be-
tween living arrangements and functioning before and after tak-
ing into account these demographic characteristics.
Third, to what extent is the relationship between living ar-
rangements and functioning attenuated or exacerbated when we
consider the resources available to the household and the de-
mands made upon its members? Certain characteristics of indi-
viduals represent the resources that they can use to ameliorate
the impact of functional limitations. Formal schooling has been
shown to have strong, persistent, and positive effects on health
and functioning (Ross & Wu, 1995). Income allows an individ-
ual to purchase equipment, services, and home alterations in the
face of deficits in functioning (Smith, 1997). The physical char-
acteristics of the dwelling may assist or further challenge a
functionally impaired person (Czaja et al., 1993; Lawton, 1990;
Pynoos & Golant, 1996).
Fourth, do differences in resources and demands exacerbate
or ameliorate racial and ethnic differentials in living arrange-
ments and functioning? Blacks function at lower levels, on av-
erage, than Whites (Schoenbaum & Waidman, 1997) and are
also more likely to live in complex and demanding households
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996). At the same time, Blacks
have lower household incomes (Smith, 1997) and lower levels
of education than Whites (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994).
Hispanic older adults are substantially more likely than others to
live with relatives (Burr & Mutchler, 1993) and to live in house-
holds with more people (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996).
They also have lower average levels of education and income
than White older adults (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994). We
assess whether these racial and ethnic differences multiply to in-
crease the potential impact of functional limitations.
METHODS
Data
Data for this analysis are drawn from Wave 1 of the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal survey of a nation-
ally representative sample of the 1931-1941 birth cohorts.
These cohorts were aged 51-61 in 1992, so the initial inter-
views for the HRS are centered in the retirement period, years
of transitions in labor supply, family structure, and health. The
analysis sample is comprised of White, Black, and Hispanic
S138 WATTEAND HUGHES
age-eligible respondents for whom information on family struc-
ture and household finances was available (N= 9,424).
Measures ofFunctioning
We report results for multiple measures of functioning, se-
lected to represent the individual's situation-free capacity in
three domains: physical, cognitive, and emotional. In construct-
ing the measures, we followed Wallace and Herzog (1995).
Definitions and distributions of these variables are summarized
in Table 1. All measures are coded so that higher values indi-
cate better functioning.
Physical functioning.--We use two measures of physical
functioning. The first, Self-Rated Health, is designed to capture
respondents' subjective assessments of their own medical and
functional status. Respondents were asked to rate their health
on a 5-point scale from poor to excellent. Although we use Self-
Rated Health as a situation-free measure of physical capacity, it
should be kept in mind that respondents may take into account
the demands and supports of their environment when assessing
their status. Second, the Mobility Index is calculated by sum-
ming responses to five items assessing difficulty with specific
forms of ambulation, such as walking a block and climbing a
flight of stairs. This measure directly assesses the individual's
capacity for physical mobility. If valid, our measures of physi-
cal functioning must relate to other health measures in theoreti-
cally meaningful ways. Wallace and Herzog (1995) show sig-
nificant associations between Self-Rated Health and the
Mobility Index and strong associations between the Mobility
Index and the presence of eight key diseases. We calculated an
alpha coefficient for the Mobility Index of .78, suggesting the
scale is internally consistent.
Missing values on the Mobility Index are due primarily to
answers that people "don't do" one or two components--walk
several blocks and climb several sets of stairs. Analyses of these
cases suggests that people do not perform these actions because
they are unable to do them, imparting a conservative bias to our
analysis by excluding persons with the most limitations.
Cognitive functioning.--The HRS includes three tests of
cognitive functioning; we use all three. The Immediate Free
Recall Test assesses ability to acquire new information and in-
volves recalling 20 nouns read by the interviewer. The score is
simply the number of words recalled. The Delayed Free Recall
Test assesses ability to remember these nouns after several in-
tervening survey questions. Again, the scores range from 0 to
20. The Similarities Subtest, which taps abstract reasoning, is
an abbreviated version of the Similarities Subtest of the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised. Seven pairs of
words were presented to the respondent with instructions to de-
scribe how the words in each pair are alike. The resulting scores
range from 0 to 14. As expected, immediate and delayed recall
are strongly correlated. All three measures are positively associ-
ated with respondents' reports of ability to think quickly and
difficulty remembering.
Approximately 8% of cases have no information for
Immediate and Delayed Recall, and 11% have no Similarities
Score. The missing information is almost completely due to re-
fusals and essentially falls into two groups: respondents who
are missing on all three measures and respondents who are

missingjust the Similarities Score. Those missing all three mea-
sures are likely to be married men living with children or oth-
ers; those missing only the Similarities Score are more likely to
be Black, Hispanic, and of lower education.
Emotionalfunctioning.--The HRS includes a short version
of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale,
which has been used extensively for respondents across a range
of ages. For each item on the scale, respondents answered in a
range of 1 to 4; the summary score is the average of the 11
LIVINGARRANGEMENTSAND FUNCTIONAL STATUS S139
items. We also use Self-Rated Emotional Health, scored on a 5-
point scale ranging from poor to excellent. Like Self-Rated
Health, these measures may reflect environmental influences so
they may be less pure measures of functional status. The
Depression Scale shows an alpha coefficient of .84, indicating
high internal consistency. Associations with Self-Rated
Emotional Health and with presence of "emotional, nervous, or
psychiatric problems" are substantial, supporting the concurrent
validity of both the Depression Scale and Self-Rated Emotional
Health (Wallace & Herzog, 1995).
Measures ofLiving Arrangements
We distinguish six living arrangements: (a) married persons
living with their spouses only; (b) married persons living with
their spouses and children only; (c) married persons living with
their spouses and others; (d) unmarried persons living alone; (e)
unmarried persons living with children only; and (f) unmarried
persons living with others. We distinguished these arrange-
ments because we believe their incumbents face qualitatively
different demands and resources. The distribution of our re-
spondents across living arrangements is shown in Table 1.
The category "unmarried" refers to current status and in-
cludes all types of non-marriage--these respondents are sepa-
rated, widowed, divorced, or never married. Due to the rarity of
cohabitation in these cohorts, we did not have enough cohabit-
ing couples for separate analysis; the 240 cohabiting respon-
dents are treated as married. Married couples or singles who are
living with others may also be living with children; we con-
structed our measures to distinguish households in which the
relationships were nuclear from those with relationships that
are more complex. The vast majority of the "others" in these
complicated households are lineal relatives who are one more
generation removed (e.g., the parents or grandchildren of the
HRS respondent). The category "single with others" includes a
substantial proportion of persons who are living in someone
else's household. In the other categories nearly all households
are headed by the HRS respondent or his or her spouse.
Measures ofCovariates
Demographic characteristics.--Because functioning on
some dimensions declines with age (Siegel, 1993), we include
a measure of age within the 51-62-years-old age range included
in the HRS. We also include the gender of the respondent, be-
cause men and women tend to differ on functioning across di-
mensions (Siegel, 1993). Finally, we include indicators of race
and ethnicity to capture rather substantial group differences in
health (Schoenbaum & Waidman, 1997). The distributions of
these and all other covariates are shown in Table 1.
Household resources.--Both education and household in-
come act as resources that can be used to offset declines in
functioning, by allowing one to alter the environment or adjust
to difficulties (Ross & Wu, 1995). Home ownership reflects
economic assets in addition to household income (Smith,
1997). Family and friends in the neighborhood, in addition to
those in the household, can act as sources of help and support
(Logan & Spitze, 1996). We also include a measure of employ-
ment, which brings both resources and demands, as does the
number of the respondent's children.
Household demands.--We include several characteristics of
the dwelling to represent the demands that the residence places
on the individual (Golant, 1992; Newman & Struyk, 1990). The
first measure indicates that the respondent did not live in a
house, but in an apartment, mobile home, or other structure. The
second variable is a crude indicator of the number of flights of
stairs the respondent might have to climb. For respondents living
in houses, this measure simply refers to the number of stories in
the house, not counting the basement. For those in apartments,
the measure indicated what floor the apartment was on. Third,
we include a dummy variable indicating whether residence had
six or more rooms. Because these three variables came from in-
terviewer observation, they included a fair amount of missing
data, which we had no reason to believe was not random. We as-
signed values for the missing cases at random according to the
distribution of values among nonmissing cases and included
variables indicating these cases in the equation. To test the impli-
cations of this procedure, we also ran models excluding cases
missing this information and found that our overall conclusions
remained unchanged. The coefficients for characteristics of the
dwelling either strengthened significantly or remained the same,
suggesting that our procedure had a conservative bias.
The final residential variable reflects the ease with which the
respondent reported that his or her dwelling could be altered to
accommodate any limitations. Modifying the home is one strat-
egy functionally impaired individuals may use in order to "age
in place" (Pynoos & Golant, 1996). We created a dummy vari-
able showing whether the respondent thought his or her house
was very easy to alter or had already been altered.
RESULTS
Tables 2,3, and 4 present the results of three ordinary least-
squares regressions for each of our seven measures of function-
ing. For each measure, the first column (Model 1) presents a
model that contains only measures of living arrangements. The
model in the second column (Model 2) adds key demographic
variables--age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. The final
model (Model 3) adds an extensive series of measures of the re-
sources available to the individual and the demands made upon
him or her. These three models correspond to our first three re-
search questions; our fourth question, relating to racial and eth-
nic differences, is addressed by both Models 2 and 3.
LivingArrangements and Functioning
The basic models (Model 1) of all the measures of function-
ing tell a consistent story: married couples living alone or only
with children show the highest levels of functioning on all di-
mensions. Couples living alone are the reference category in
our analyses; the significant coefficients for the dummy vari-
ables representing alternative living arrangements are nearly all
negative, indicating that individuals in these other arrangements
have poorer functioning than individuals who are members of
married couples living alone. However, on all dimensions but
one, married couples living only with their children are at least
as advantaged as solo couples. In fact, on the Mobility Index,
married couples with children appear to function somewhat
better than solo couples.
The magnitudes of the differences between members of mar-
ried couples and persons in other arrangements differ by the
particular arrangements. Without exception, single adults living

with others show the lowest levels of functioning on all mea-
sures of all dimensions. Moreover, the differences in function-
ing between married adults living alone and single adults living
with others are generally on the order of a half a point on 5-
point scales like Self-Rated Health, and a full point on scales
like Immediate and Delayed Recall, which range from 0 to 20.
Thus the deficits in functioning of single adults living with oth-
ers tend to be substantially larger than those of adults in any
other riving arrangement.
These groups--married couples living with and without chil-
dren and single adults living with others--anchor the high and
low ends, respectively, of the continuum of functioning across
all dimensions. The groups in between--single adults living
alone, single parents living with children, and married couples
who live with people other than their children--all fall in the
middle on functioning, always significantly worse than married
couples alone or with children only, and always better than sin-
gle adults living with others. But within this middle range, rela-
tive positions shift across measures and dimensions.
In sum, respondents in what are likely to be the most support-
ive household structures--married couples with and without chil-
dren--also show the highest levels of functioning, and those in
the potentially least supportive or most demanding household
structures--single adults living alone, living with children, or liv-
ing with others--show the lowest levels of functioning. Recall
that most of those in households with others live with their own
parents, who would be quite aged, or with grandchildren. In either
case, these others are more likely to bring demands than resources.
Adding Demographic Characteristics
Model 2 adds basic demographic characteristics to Model 1. It
shows that for all measures of functioning, holding constant basic
demographic characteristics reduces the deficits shown by those
in unmarried or complex households. For example, in the model

of Self-Rated Health, the coefficient for "couple with others" in-
creases from -.293 to -.154 and the coefficient for "single with
others" falls from -.5% to -.384 with the addition of demographic
characteristics. Clearly, some of the lower average levels of func-
tioning among single adults living alone, with children only, or
with others stem from age, gender, race, or ethnicity. However, in
almost all cases, the coefficients that were significant in the basic
model remain statistically significant with the addition of demo-
graphic characteristics, and we continue to see significantly lower
levels of functioning for persons in these households compared to
members of married couples who live alone. The two exceptions
both appear for single adults living with children: taking account
of demographic characteristics eliminates the previous functional
deficits for persons in this arrangement on the Mobility Index and
the Similarities Test Score.
Model 2 also highlights the large differentials in functioning
across racial and ethnic groups. The coefficients for "Black"
and "Hispanic" are quite large for all measures of functioning,
often the largest or among the largest in the model. Thus, con-
sistent with previous research, we find that Blacks and
Hispanics are disadvantaged with respect to physical, cognitive,
and emotional functioning. The strongest effects of race and
ethnicity appear for the three measures of cognitive functioning
and the smallest for the two measures of emotional functioning.
Adding Household Resources and Demands
In Model 3, we add measures of household resources and de-
mands to Model 2 to assess whether differential functioning by
living arrangement merely reflects these characteristics. The
model shows somewhat smaller coefficients for living arrange-
ments than the previous models. But in virtually all cases, the
pattern observed in Model 1 remains: those living in unmarried
or complex households show deficits in functioning compared
with members of married couples living alone or with children

only. The exceptions include "couple with others" in the model
of Similarities Score, and "single alone" in the model of
Immediate Recall, both of which are no longer significantly dif-
ferent from members of married couples living alone. In several
cases insignificant differences become significant in the more
complex model, including "couple with children" for both mea-
sures of emotional health, and Immediate Recall and "single with
children" for the Mobility Index and Similarities Test Score.
However, in this final model, we no longer observe that single
persons living with others always have the poorest functioning.
Although they are often the most disadvantaged, on some mea-
sures single persons in other arrangements or couples in com-
plex arrangements are the most functionally limited. Thus the
pattern has shifted somewhat, to a distinction between members
of married couples with and without children and all others.
It is also evident from Model 3 that respondents with the most
personal resources also tend to show the highest levels of func-
tioning. For instance, consistent with previous research, higher
education and greater income are associated with better func-
tioning. Respondents who do not own their residences show sig-
nificantly lower functioning on all measures, net of household
income. Well-educated and high-income individuals are the
most able to compensate for reduced functioning and thus avoid
experiencing disability, for example, by purchasing services or
by altering the demands of their environment. Respondents who
own their own homes both have larger assets and are more likely
to be able to alter their environments. Current employment has a
strong positive association with functioning on all measures but
one (Similarities Test Score), probably because low functioning
reduces the chances of employment.
In contrast to the importance of these personal resources,
neighborhood resources in the form of either friends or family
fail to show any relationship with functioning in slightly more
than half the models. Where significant effects appear, respon-
LIVINGARRANGEMENTSAND FUNCTIONAL STATUS S143
dents with friends in the neighborhood tend to have higher lev-
els of functioning, whereas those with family in the neighbor-
hood tend to have lower levels of functioning.
Turning to the physical demands of the household setting, re-
spondents with relatively demanding settings (i.e., two or more
stories and/or relatively large dwellings) tend to show higher
levels of functioning, perhaps because those with difficulties
have altered their living situations to meet their needs.
Alternatively, this association may appear because respondents
of higher socioeconomic status have both higher functioning
and larger dwellings with more stories.
Finally, Blacks still show significantly lower levels of func-
tioning on the physical and cognitive dimensions, but not on the
emotional dimension. Thus the physical and cognitive functional
deficits that Blacks experience are not accounted for by any of
the characteristics we have included in this model. In contrast, the
deficits in functioning that appeared for Hispanics in Model 2 are
reduced in the most complete model and sometimes eliminated
(for Self-Rated Physical Health and the Depression Index).
Interactions by Gender and Race/Ethnicity
We reestimated Model 3 (results not shown; availablefromthe
corresponding author) with interactions between gender and liv-
ing arrangements to determine whether the association between
functioning and household structure differed for men and
women. These results suggest that, on balance, men and women
in different types of living arrangements show quite similar levels
of functioning. We found that of the 35 interactions we examined
only 7 were significant; all indicated higher functioning for men.
Five of the 7 appeared for physical functioning and 2 for cogni-
tive functioning. No other differences by gender appeared.
We also reestimated Model 3 (results not shown) allowing
interactions between living arrangements and race/ethnicity
and, again, found few differences in the relationship with func-
tioning. Of the 35 interactions we tested for Blacks, only 3 were
significant and all appeared for Immediate Recall. Blacks living
in married couple households with children, in married couple
households with others, and unmarried Blacks living with oth-
ers showed lower scores than Whites in similar households.
The relationship between functioning and living arrange-
ments for Hispanics, however, shows some consistent and theo-
retically interpretable patterns. Hispanic adults living in married
couple households with others--most often parents or grand-
children--show higher levels of functioning across four of the
seven measures, Self-Rated Health, Mobility Index, Depression
Scale, and Self-Rated Emotional Health, than Whites in similar
households. These patterns are consistent with arguments that
for cultural reasons Hispanics value family closeness and inter-
generational coresidence (Himes et al., 1996). We also found
that Hispanic adults living alone show worse scores on the
Depression Scale and on the Similarities Score, perhaps be-
cause this living arrangement is culturally devalued and indica-
tive of greater distress among Hispanics man other groups.
DISCUSSION
In this article, we have presented strong and consistent evi-
dence of differential physical, emotional and cognitive function-
ing by living arrangement among adults in their 50s and early
60s. Married couples living alone show the highest levels of
functioning, with married couples living with children a very
close second. Single adults living in complex households show
the lowest levels of functioning on all dimensions. Deficits in
functioning for persons in unmarried and complex households
are reduced but not eliminated when we take demographic char-
acteristics and household resources and demands into account.
Clearly, the patterns of functioning and living arrangements that
we observe in this cross section are the result of prior processes,
including the impact of living arrangements on pathology, im-
pairments and functioning, and perhaps adjustments in house-
hold structure to compensate for functional limitations.
These patterns point to vulnerabilities for some adults as they
age and experience further declines in functioning. Generally,
individuals best equipped to deal with reductions in physical,
cognitive, or emotional functioning have access to help from
others in the household, adequate resources, and a relatively
malleable and/or undemanding environment. However, we
found a definite pattern of poorer functioning among respon-
dents who are arguably in the most demanding and least sup-
portive household environments.
In addition, adults who are already functioning at less than
optimal levels in late middle age are often disadvantaged in
other ways. We see this especially for the Black and Hispanic
adults in our sample. Both groups consistently function at lower
levels and are more likely to live in unmarried or complex
households than Whites. They also tend to have lower house-
hold incomes, fewer assets, and lower levels of education than
Whites of the same age. Thus, Black and Hispanic older adults
are likely to be disadvantaged in their levels of physical, emo-
tional, and cognitive functioning, the demands and supports in
their households, and the resources that they can bring to bear
on any problems that arise. From this perspective, it is mislead-
ing to say that, for example, Black older adults function at only
slightly lower levels than Whites, once we take into account
their education, income, family structure, and other factors. In
fact, Black, and to a lesser extent, Hispanic adults suffer from a
combination of threats to their well-being that points to a vul-
nerable andrisk-filledtransition from middle to old age.
Disability, not death, is the principal consequence of chronic
conditions and the principal concern of aging societies (Jette,
1996; Olshansky Carnes, & Cassel, 1990). Recent conceptual-
izations suggest that disability ultimately results from the inter-
action of the individual's functional capacity and the social and
physical environment that he or she encounters (Pope & Tarlov,
1991; Verbrugge & Jette, 1994; World Health Organization,
1997). We have argued that the household is a particularly criti-
cal environment for the development of disability, for it defines
the roles an individual expects to fill, the tasks associated with
these roles, interactions with others, and a built environment.
Both previous research and U.S. public policy have stressed the
importance of physical environment in shaping the experience
of disability. Our results, which show a distinct patterning of
living arrangements and functional status, suggest that we
should look closely at the household as a key social context in
which disability may be created or avoided.
Future research on the role of the household in the disable-
ment process will need to adopt a dynamic view, examining tran-
sitions in functional status, household structure, and disability
overtime.This will require specifying more exactly how various
household types create or prevent disability. We have assumed
and not examined differences across household structures in de-
S144 WATTEAND HUGHES
mands and supports to members. In addition, attention must be
paid to intrahousehold processes of adjustment, as the internal
dynamics of the household will certainly affect how members re-
spond to functional limitations. It will be particularly important
to examine these processes separately by race and ethnicity.
Clearly, such approaches also require moving beyond the
task batteries of Basic and Instrumental Activities of Daily
Living as indicators of disability. The emphasis in the disable-
ment process on the variety of human activities and the situa-
tional and experienced nature of disability suggest a more sub-
jective notion of disability. This innovation will need to be
paired with situation-free measures of functional status in order
to assess rigorously the interaction of functional status and
household environment in the creation of disability.
The difficulties presented by systematically investigating the
environmental creation of disability from functional limitations
are inherent to relational definitions of disability (Verbrugge &
Jette, 1994). However, explicitly addressing the contextual cre-
ation of disability is not merely a semantic issue. Current ap-
proaches to "successful aging" emphasize a holistic approach to
aging well, in particular maintaining health, physical, and cogni-
tive functioning, and engagement with life (Rowe & Kahn, 1997).
Assessing the ways in which personal functional status and envi-
ronmental characteristics shape individuals' ability to carry out
usual roles is entirely consistent with this aim. Such knowledge
could have large theoretical and practical payoffs and help main-
tain a high quality of life of future generations ofelders.
