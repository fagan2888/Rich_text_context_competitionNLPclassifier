Mass legal executions in America up to
1865
Pagination de l'édition papier : p. 33-61
1 Throughout recorded history, governments have executed citizens and subjects. In many
instances, groups of persons were executed for the same offense. People have been executed
because they have a specific trait (i.e., race, religion) and/or political beliefs that were believed
to threaten the states, or an undesired trait may simply have increased the likelihood of
execution for less political offenses. Threats to the state may also have affected the probability
of mass execution of those charged with mala in se crimes, such as murder or rape.
2 Currently, a mass legal execution would be extremely unlikely in the United States, since
the execution of any convicted prisoner is rare. The cost to taxpayers in the prosecution,
defense, and appeals process, coupled with the delaying tactics of attorneys defending death
row inmates has made any execution problematic. In addition, with the recent limitations on
the use of the felony murder rule and the use of testimony by those involved in a crime against
accomplices, it unlikely that as many as two persons will be executed for the same crime in
the United States, and difficult to imagine more than two being thus executed. It took a stretch
of the American constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy to raise the possibility of a
second person's eventually being executed for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed
169 persons, and after ten Muslim terrorists were convicted of murdering six and injuring over
a thousand in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City ­ a nearly successful
effort to bring down the building and kill 10 000 to 20 000 persons ­ there were no initial
sentences of death2. That certainly suggests that the execution of four blacks for a murder in
Arkansas in 1960 was the last mass execution3.
3 The concept of mass execution is easy enough to understand, with various works focusing
on numerous such incidents over time4. An Internet search engine asked to look for «mass
execution» will instantly find several thousand references, from a book about America's
execution of seven German prisoners of war with the phrase in its subtitle, to reports about
mass executions of millions of persons5. Like mass murder or serial murder, it may be easier
to understand the general idea than to come up with a working definition suitable for statistical
analysis. Mass legal execution is here defined as the execution of four or more persons for
the same criminal incident by government entities following some form of trial. Over time, of
course, what constituted a trial and due process varied, with fairness varying even within the
same time periods and in the same colonies or states.
4 The questions that remain are how frequent were mass legal executions in the United States
during its history from colonial times on, and what a study of those executions reveals that more
general studies about capital punishment will not. Ordinary executions reveal what crimes
were being committed for which the death penalty was the normal, and accepted, sentence,
and the sorts of persons ­ minorities, literal or societal outsiders ­ on whom such sentences
were most likely to have been imposed. A decline in the number of persons executed singly
for burglary or robbery as the eighteenth century progressed suggests that capital punishment
was ceasing to be an accepted punishment for property related crimes, with juries declining to
convict or governors eager to commute death sentences for those crimes, even before the law
removed them from the list of capital offenses6.
5 The change in types of crimes subject to ordinary capital punishment certainly shows change.
Through the eighteenth century, only three-eighths of those executed were convicted of
murder; it accounted for an increasing percentage of those executed in the nineteenth century,
over 90% of those executed during the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, and, for
several decades now, the only crime for which criminals are executed. But murder was
the primary offense for only 8% of those executed in groups of four or more through the

eighteenth century7. There were three general types of behavior that led to mass executions.
The first involved actions that were seen as such threats to the social order as to be sanctioned
by both legal and extra legal execution, the latter with no fear of government punishment
of the executioners. For these threats, executions following due process were generally
outnumbered by less formal mass killings. In antebellum America, the three most common
instances involved insurrections, uprisings, and treason or other war crimes ­ or the fear
of such potential actions ­ by slaves, Indians, and supporters of the enemy. Less common
were some perceived threats from religious and ethnic minorities, as well as from ordinary
criminals prior to effective organization of courts8. For some of those offenders, mass legal
executions sometimes had benefits for the victim beyond the perfunctory shriving time allowed
condemned slaves. The most offensive actions by slaves were punished by hideous tortures
without pretense of trials9. For this type of offense, just as criminologists often prefer to
study homicide because that crime is more consistently reported than other offenses, so legal
executions may provide the best hard data on matters of such concern to society as to be
thought worthy of the ultimate sanction.
6 The second type of offenses were actions seen as generally group threats to organized society,
but only punished by organized society. The most prominent example was a single American
episode of witchcraft, but piracy was a more common example. The final category involved
offenses of no apparent concern to the public at large, but of overriding concern to its leaders,
who often thought anything short of mass execution would be an inadequate deterrent. Military
leaders periodically found the threat of desertion or mutiny to require exemplary executions
to restore proper discipline.
7 Capital punishment itself probably better indicated not just the crimes but the criminals society
most feared. For example, when blacks and whites were both convicted in connection with
slave insurrections, blacks ­ slave or free ­ were generally subject to capital punishment while
whites were subject to corporal punishment and expulsion10. Similarly, blacks were much more
likely to be executed for homicide alone, whereas whites were more likely hanged only for
what would now be described as aggravated homicide: murder in the course of another felony
such as robbery or rape11. There were also differences in the way criminals were treated after
sentencing. For example, from the seventeenth on into the early nineteenth century, persons
condemned to die were often given two weeks or more to prepare their souls to meet their
maker, but delays were generally relatively short for those executed in mass executions.
8 Mass executions could, however, serve as a bellwether of the crimes most likely to continue to
be acceptable as capital offenses. From the seventeenth on early into the nineteenth centuries,
the North may have more severely punished moral offenses and the South property offenses,
but the last mass legal executions for such offenses occurred near the end of the seventeenth
century in the North and early in the eighteenth century in the South, a century before they
ceased to be capital offenses. Later in the eighteenth and into the nineteenth centuries, when
capital punishment remained acceptable for civilians primarily just for violent crimes, mass
executions occurred only for fatal offenses in the North and for fatal offenses plus slave revolts
in the South. Finally, although it took until the final third of the twentieth century for capital
punishment to be limited to aggravated murder, such a limitation had occurred, at least for
Caucasian mass executions, by the final third of the nineteenth century12. Offenses that failed
to lead to mass executions suggested crimes that eventually would cease to be acceptable for
any executions, or else ceased to occur as crimes.
9 In addition to indicating popular fears or concerns, others factors also affected trends in the
numbers of mass executions over time. What constituted a capital offense varied over time,
from place to place within the same period, or was dependent upon status. By the end of
the eighteenth century, for example, the South had many more capital property offenses than
the North, and felonies punishable with imprisonment of whites were capital offenses when
committed by blacks, especially if they were slaves13. Even within a region, the time and
place of executions for slave revolts indicated not simply general, but localized, fears of
insurrection14.

10 Similarly, the extent of adversarial process varied over time and circumstance, with
substantially less of an adversarial process for all trials before the late eighteenth century, and
then still less due process afforded blacks and Indians than whites, and with lower levels of due
process for military trials than in civilian courts. This study focuses on executions following
due process of groups convicted for the same offense rather than just a common execution date
and place, with some thoughts on why mass legal executions changed in nature and number
in postbellum America.
Method
11 For several reasons, there is no complete record of mass legal executions in the United States.
First, this has been an area that has not been researched by others. Specific instances may
be famous and have been the focus of intense scholarship (e.g., the Salem witch trials, the
Lincoln assassination trial), but this is the first attempt to begin to quantify and compare them.
Second, many instances of mass execution may have been lost to history. Third, even defining
mass legal execution is no simple task; it is one of several terms or concepts for which the
temptation is to repeat what American Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart substituted for a
precise definition of obscenity: «I know it when I see it.»
12 To impose a precise definition on a less precise concept, mass legal execution is here defined
as the execution, by duly constituted authorities following some form of trial, of four or more
persons for the same criminal incident, in what is now the United States (excluding territories).
This definition of «mass» was fashioned after a fairly common criminological definition for
mass murder as the criminal killing of four or more persons; this number was recently also
used for a study of mass lynching15. A complicating factor is defining «incident» since the
same fears that led to mass executions might involve a variety of specific charges, particularly
where different evidence might exist as to the existence of witchcraft or a conspiracy of slaves
to revolt. A cursory look at incidents in New York and nationally suggests that reducing the
number executed from four to three ­ another popular number for criminological studies of
mass murder ­ would increase the number of such executions but not change the sorts of crimes
thus punished16. Reducing the number to two would, like single executions, tell more about
the sorts of crimes and criminals subjected to capital punishment ­ that is, the willingness of
society to use capital punishment ­ but rarely anything more. Executions by Indians of persons
of European, African, or Asian descent are excluded regardless of whether tribal due process
was observed, as are war related summary executions most commonly found in wars involving
various Indian tribes and explorers and colonists from England, Spain, and France17.
13 One complicating factor for this definition is determining what constitutes due process of law.
It is fairly clear that ordinary lynchings would not fall within this definition, even though
some lynchings included at least the pretense of a trial. Yet some vigilance committees,
acting regarding slave revolts and ordinary crimes, operated with more serious trials before
executing those condemned than some judicial trials for slave revolts. For some executions,
particularly military ones, it is not totally clear which executions were summary or followed
courts martial, whether any court martial seriously considered evidence or simply ordered
summary executions, or, for that matter, how many of those executed for the same incident had
hearings and how many did not. A good example of such confusion, at least in reports, would
be the termination of Bacon's Rebellion in 1676 Virginia, where the total number executed was
probably 23, with some clearly summary executions, some possibly following courts martial,
however seriously held, and some civil trials18.
14 In most studies dealing historically with capital punishment in America, any discussion of
mass executions has been anecdotal or not really mentioned at all. Such executions are rarely
featured in general studies of capital punishment in America, or in those works dealing only
with limited aspects of capital punishment, such as the executions of assassins or military
executions19. The few published studies of capital punishment in different states or territories
have reports of mass executions in Pennsylvania and in New York, included in lists of everyone
known to have been legally executed in those two states, and even there, mass executions were
rare and constituted a small minority20.

15 The major exception is in Herbert Aptheker's study of slave uprisings, where he noted the
punishments meted out when the uprisings were put down, with some effort to distinguish
between those executed by the authorities and those simply killed by either private parties
or military or militia bodies. It is not certain that he was always able to make the distinction
accurately, with flaws generally (but not invariably) exaggerating rather than minimizing the
number lawfully executed. It is also not clear that the punishments were for actual conspiracies
or revolts, or because of unfounded fears of possible revolt. As an indication of social fear,
however, the reality of the conspiracy is not relevant21.
16 After reviewing the literature, the next step was to examine the list, compiled by M. Watt
Espy, Jr., of legal executions from colonial times to the present. That list currently includes
almost 19 000 executions, but there is access to only three fourths of it, generally referred
to as the Espy File; that portion is available on-line from the Inter-university Consortium
for Political and Social Research, and it is not always reliable because of coding errors. For
example, the black slaves executed for a revolt in New York City in 1712 are all recorded as
Caucasians22. Also, the data are incomplete23. This might be partly because, until the 1820s
and 1830s, newspapers rarely reported executions, which might be covered by broadsides
instead, which are less likely to have survived to the present. Official local records have
often disappeared in numerous courthouse fires, accidental and deliberate. For example, Philip
Schwarz can document the death sentence for four slaves among a larger group charged with
«stealing themselves» and a boat in an escape attempt, but the records of what followed are
missing.24 Newspaper coverage improved when executions changed from public areas to the
privacy of prison yards25. In addition, colonial records were often better at recording sentences
of death than whether those sentences were carried out; commutations were fairly common
in antebellum America26. Overall, sources differ in the numbers of persons executed for the
same incident, their ethnicity, the date of execution, and the offense for which persons were
executed. For slave executions, variation in date is sometimes explainable by Espy's use of the
date compensation was paid to the slaves' owners rather than the actual execution date, since
compensation established greater certainty that a recorded death sentence was implemented.
17 In addition to ordinary problems, ideology affects some of the data. With slave owners fearing
slave revolt, they may have seen activity as revolt where it had not actually occurred, but slave
owners also thought it best to minimize incidents of possible revolt both to avoid inspiring
additional revolts and to preserve the image of satisfied slaves. One result was to both perceive
and punish possible revolt as simply murder. Herbert Aptheker, on the other hand, had his own
ideological bias leading him to see uprising of the oppressed even where it may just have been
murder. At the time of his initial research, the Communist Party, in which he was an active
member, was tying itself to civil rights issues, and finding slave revolts helped both to show
that blacks were not so docile as southerners pretended, and to encourage the idea of nascent
revolutionary activity against an oppressive capitalist system. Similarly, the prominent Samuel
Sewall's diary described killings by Indians in the Massachusetts Bay colony, followed by
an execution of several of them27. The Indians were involved in King Philip's war, but the
colonists viewed many Indian conflicts as crimes, with trial and execution28.
18 Espy's data are by no means definitive, and some other data sources have different numbers
of persons executed at the same time and place for the same offense. In addition to
incompleteness, inconsistencies, and coding errors, there are two minor problems with the
Espy data, making them suggestive but insufficient. First, listings alone cannot tell whether
an offense qualifies as a mass execution for two reasons: a listing by dates might suggest
that executions on the same date are related when they may not be, and the Espy File would
fail to call attention to executions of persons for the same criminal incident that are spread
out over time. The first was a problem primarily in the earlier years of the republic and prior
colonial times, particularly in northern urban areas, where executions were done in groups
even if the individuals had nothing in common beyond the day they died. A listing that four
persons were executed for murder on a particular day in Philadelphia, for example, does not
mean that they were involved in the same murder29. This tendency is a potential problem
Mass legal executions in America up to 1865 6
Crime, Histoire & Sociétés / Crime, History & Societies, Vol. 8, n°2 | 2004
primarily for mass executions for murder. It did not exist to the same extent in southern
dealings with blacks, where there was less tendency to have regular hanging days or to be
concerned about leaving sufficient shriving time. If four or more slaves were executed at the
same time for the same offense in a rural county, particularly if they were owned by the same
person, it is likely that it was a mass execution30. Nor did the problem occur with other offenses
more common in antebellum mass executions than ordinary executions. Pirates, witches, and
Indians, for example, were not executed with criminals associated with different criminal
incidents. Even for murder, the problem was minimized in most jurisdictions by the goal of
staging the execution to maximize its deterrent value, often hanging the offender near the scene
of the offense31.
19 The second problem, rare before 1866, is that persons might be executed for the same offense
but on different dates, with the common tie lacking in broad listings of executions. Two
antebellum examples would be that using a single date alone would separate the three groups
and two individuals executed for witchcraft in Salem and would separate John Brown from
the execution of most of his co-conspirators in the Harpers Ferry raid, who were executed two
weeks later, and from an additional pair executed three months later32.
20 Various military sources and books about America's wars on American soil were used to find
military executions; such instances are not systematically included in the Espy File, which
is devoted to executions «under civil authority» (although he certainly lists some executions
for desertion). A variety of sources, especially Aptheker's study of slave uprisings, but also
general books on capital punishment, the Internet, and other sources, also have been used to
attempt to find pre Civil War era legal executions. It would appear that of the nearly 20 000
legal executions in what is now the United States from the seventeenth century to the present,
approximately 8% of those executed were involved in mass executions as here defined; mass
executions accounted for over a quarter of those executed before the end of the Civil War
and just 3% of those executed during the following century. As with all such percentages
mentioned, this is approximate, since the complete list compiled by Espy has not been made
public. A list of known pre 1866 mass legal executions is appended. One thing the data clearly
indicate is that there was a dramatic change in the nature of mass legal executions following
the conclusion of the Civil War, partly because of the nature of the crimes subject to capital
punishment and partly because blacks were kept in their place not by slave patrols and the
suppression of slave revolts but by Jim Crow laws and the use of lynching and other forms
of intimidation.
Executions through 1865
21 The vast majority of America's mass legal executions occurred during a span of just over
two centuries, as the population grew from about a quarter million to nearer forty million
persons. Only about one eighth of the subjects of mass executions had been convicted of
murder, currently the only crime for which persons are sentenced to death and that even then
accounted for 60% of all executions. About one fifth of the mass executions involved crimes
related to war (treason, desertion, mutiny, espionage), with about 9% involving piracy. If the
small number of legal executions related to Indian uprisings are added to those related to slave
revolts, mass executions for those two offenses by oppressed minorities against the ruling
authority account for over half of the mass legal executions in those two centuries. Meanwhile,
the most famous mass legal executions, resulting from the Salem witch trials, accounted for
just 2% of the mass executions of the period prior to the end of 1865.
22 There were a number of reasons for more mass legal executions in the first centuries of
European residency in America. Some crimes ­ slave revolt and piracy, for example ­ are
group activities, inviting punishments of groups. In addition, the legal system made mass
execution easier. Death was the mandatory sentence for some felonies. In the South, trials
might be before a justice of the peace rather than a jury; when with a jury, slaveholders were
overrepresented, further minimizing due process for accused slaves. The rules of evidence
impaired the ability of slaves to defend themselves, while protecting whites since blacks could
not testify against them. As a result, convictions were easier to obtain and appeals were almost
Mass legal executions in America up to 1865 7
Crime, Histoire & Sociétés / Crime, History & Societies, Vol. 8, n°2 | 2004
nonexistent; even petitions for gubernatorial commutation might only be initiated by free
men. Trials remained relatively rapid, with appeals relatively rare, throughout the nineteenth
century33.
23 On the other hand, as perceptions of what offenses warranted execution changed in the second
half of the eighteenth century, there was a greater tendency for jury nullification, especially
with property crimes, where the only sentence for the guilty was death. In addition, convicts
might seek commutation of the sentence, generally from the governor, and arguments for
commutation might include legal as well as other arguments; executive clemency prevented
many executions from occurring. In the northern colonies, and later states, there might be
weeks or months between conviction for most crimes and execution to allow the condemned
to prepare his soul for God and to seek clemency on earth, although delays were sometimes
minimal in the case of witches, pirates, and soldiers.
24 Indeed, one difference between normal executions and mass executions may have been the
way culprits were perceived and thus the speed with which mass executions were carried out.
The general seventeenth and eighteenth century view was that all men were sinners; those
committing capital crimes subject to execution were seen as similar to other folks who, but
for the grace of God, might have committed the same act. However, this perception did not
apply to the crimes and criminals subject to mass executions; they were viewed more as the
condemned generally in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There was less concern with
allowing time for, and encouraging, penitence in the nineteenth century, as the view changed
from one of all men being sinners to one that the law abiding were virtuous and the condemned
more alien. In the southern colonies and later states, particularly when dealing with black
defendants, there was less concern with the condemned slaves' souls, and executions were
conducted more promptly34.
Piracy
25 Hanging pirates accounts for roughly 9% of the mass executions through 1865; there were
ten incidents beginning with the first mass execution in 1661, with the last mass execution
for piracy occurring in 1835. Piracy was a crime for which mass execution seems particularly
feasible, and about two thirds of all persons executed for piracy were hanged in groups. Their
offense was the most serious of property crimes, threatening as it did trade in which the
government had a compelling interest and thus a crime more against the government than other
property offenses. In the seventeenth century, Sir Edward Coke, probably the most important
legal figure for colonial America, described a pirate as «an enemy of the human race»35. In
addition to being societal outsiders, with no ties to or defenders in the community, their arrest
may well have involved the risk to, or actual loss of life of, the arresting body36.
26 Pirate life was fairly democratic, with the captain first among equals, making it difficult for
associates to claim either impressment or innocence, although some suspects did successfully
claim compulsion or, essentially, apprenticeship status. The democratic nature of life as a
pirate was in many ways more appealing than life in the navy or on ordinary merchant ships.
In addition, relatively few pirates were actually captured. At any rate, on those occasions
when pirates were captured and tried in a group, they also were hanged as a group, and fairly
promptly, often less than ten days after conviction37. In recounting a mere two day delay
between sentence and execution of some pirates in the British West Indies, for example, Daniel
Defoe recounted that, when the «Prisoners pray'd for longer Time to repent and prepare for
Death,» their request was rejected. They were told that they should have been using the four
weeks since their apprehension for that since from that date on «they ought to have accounted
themselves as condemned by the Laws of all Nations»38. Although not all pirates were male,
all those hanged in mass executions in America were, and, where ethnicity was noted, the only
minority reported was a group of five Hispanics, the final group of pirates hanged, in 183539.
Witchcraft
27 The Salem witch trials led to perhaps the best known of mass executions in colonial America.
The Salem witch trial suspects included prominent persons as well as those in ill repute, and
Mass legal executions in America up to 1865 8
Crime, Histoire & Sociétés / Crime, History & Societies, Vol. 8, n°2 | 2004
men and children in addition to women. With one of the leaders of the prosecutorial conspiracy
a physician, the victims included midwives and a competing physician. Political, religious,
economic, and even family feuding may have been distinguishing characteristics of the Salem
trials, which could also be seen as an effort to explain and expiate whatever sins had led God
to abandon the English colonists so that they were humiliated in a military attack on French
(Canadian) colonists40. The witch hunt eventually included about two hundred suspects in as
an area with perhaps a thousand households.
28 The 20 men and women executed primarily on July 19, August 19, and September 22, 1692 ­
the last male, refusing to plea, was pressed to death on September 19 ­ constituted 57%
of alleged witches executed in America. Four others died while imprisoned in Salem that
year, including the infant daughter of one of those hanged, whose older sister, aged four, the
youngest accused and imprisoned for witchcraft, was released on bail after her mother's death.
The times between condemnation and execution varied. Although only a week passed between
the first condemnation and execution, a group of five women executed in July had three
weeks to prepare, those in August two weeks, and those in September included some given
two weeks and some only five days41. Once the governor prohibited spectral evidence, most
witchcraft trials ended in acquittal with the few convictions commuted. During the seventeenth
century, an additional 13 persons (mostly women) were hanged as witches in Connecticut and
Massachusetts, and one slave woman in Maryland in 177942. Those selective hangings fail to
indicate the same pervasive social fear as the Salem witch hunt.
Murder and other felonies
29 Only about one sixth of the persons included in mass executions during this period dealt with
ordinary murders or the other felonies (especially robbery and burglary) for which capital
punishment was commonly the sanction, at least through most of the eighteenth century.
Whereas about 28% of all persons executed before 1866 were involved with mass executions,
only about 7% of convicted murderers were thus dealt with. Several reasons help to explain
this. One is that most such crimes probably included only one or two culprits. Another is
that gang activities might still escape such punishment since, particularly in the North, two
legal responses limited such executions. First, since the mandatory sentence for conviction
of serious felonies was execution, juries occasionally simply acquitted those clearly guilty if
they deemed death too severe a sentence for less culpable gang members. Second, executive
clemency ­ commutation of sentences by the governor (or, in a few colonies or states, other
bodies with pardoning power) ­ was fairly common, granted in one quarter to one half of death
sentences as compared to one or two percent in twentieth century America.
30 By the nineteenth century, only the South retained capital punishment for large numbers of
felonies less serious than murder, particularly for such crimes as sexual assaults, committed by
slaves43. Even with murder and serious offenses, mass execution was most likely when there
was some aggravating factor, such as homicides committed in the course of robbery and/or by
gangs ­ robbery related murder being considered into the nineteenth century, as it had been
for centuries, as an especially heinous murder ­ or by slaves, Indians, Hispanics, and others
considered to be outsiders44.
War related executions
31 Approximately 20% percent of the massexecutions during the period were related to military
activities, probably enhanced by the fact that two major wars of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries were civil wars, where both sides were represented by American civilians. The
number understates the actual figure. There were some summary military executions without
use of courts martial. Also, executions following courts martial by British forces during the
Revolutionary War would not have been viewed as following due process by the existing
revolutionary authorities. The impact of war on executions can be shown by the fact that
whereas a quarter of those executed antebellum were subjects of mass execution, well over
half of Civil War era executions occurred en masse.
Mass legal executions in America up to 1865 9
Crime, Histoire & Sociétés / Crime, History & Societies, Vol. 8, n°2 | 2004
32 A number of the war related mass executions appear to be related to popular concerns about
disloyalty among fellow citizens and to concerns by military leaders about the relatively
common problem of desertion and/or mutiny. The first such mass executions occurred when
Sir William Berkeley, Virginia's governor, put down Bacon's rebellion in 1676-77, with 23
executed for treason, 14 of whom were after quick courts martial often presided over by the
governor against whom they were rebelling but 9 were after civilian convictions45. A few of
the other mass executions were also related to more localized events such as two groups of
deserters executed in New York in May 1756 during the French and Indian [Seven Years]
War, and one group for treason in Louisiana in 1769, where the hope was for French rather
than Spanish rule46.
33 Desertion was a common problem in America's eighteenth and nineteenth century wars
(French and Indian War, Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Civil War), as were executions
for desertion, with the number executed increasing partly to frighten potential deserters from
committing that offense; other means included rewards for capturing deserters and offers of
pardons to deserters who returned fairly promptly to duty47. Most executions for desertion ­
perhaps 60% of those so slain ­ were mass executions. In 1756, convicted New York deserters
were split into two groups for execution to enlarge the sphere of deterrence, one group
in Albany, where the court martial occurred, with another group sent to Schenectady for
execution. During the War of 1812, General Winfield Scott ordered a court martial that had
originally sentenced only one deserter to die, to reconsider and order all four convicts to be
shot48. The execution of deserters during these wars was actually imposed on only a fraction
of the persons who were guilty of the offense, with the number chosen based on perceptions
of what was needed to impose discipline.
34 Such mass executions were not based on social or popular concerns but on efforts by the
military and political leaders to ensure compliance with orders. It may be indicative of a greater
problem with desertion by Confederate forces, particularly in the later stages of the war, that
led to more victims of mass execution for desertion in the Confederacy ­ 55 in three incidents,
with 22 possibly not really deserters, versus 18 in four incidents of Union soldiers49.
35 A complicating factor in some wars was determining which soldiers were deserting and which
were merely fighting for the side other than the one for which they were expected to fight.
The Confederacy executed for desertion 22 white males who had been fighting with Union
forces, insisting the men were not Union soldiers, and thus prisoners of war, but Confederate
deserters. The perceived execution of POWs led to formal protest and the threat of similar
executions by Union forces of Confederate POWs should there be any repetition of the event50.
There were three instances of mass execution of black Union soldiers, not for desertion but
for rape, murder, and mutiny, with all of the executions coming after General Robert E.
Lee's surrender at Appomattox. There were no mass executions recorded of white Union or
Confederate soldiers for violent offenses, except for Confederate soldiers executed primarily
for desertion, but who also had murdered while resisting arrest for desertion51.
36 Some of the military related mass executions during America's wars for independence and
preservation of the union involved perceptions of treason. Unlike desertion, the executions of
perceived enemies clearly indicated social fears along with strong popular views. Some Tory
sympathizers were executed for treason, murder, and/or robbery, for acts they presumably saw
as supportive of the legitimate government52. Again, similar actions against those supporting
independence might not have been recorded as legal executions.
37 There were similar executions by both sides of the Civil War. For example, in north Texas
where there was concern that relatively recent arrivals who were non slaveholders might be
sympathetic to the Union side, there were not only mass executions of a total of 36 men
immediately following a trial, but the lynching of another 14 and informal shooting of three
others, with no trial or prior to a verdict from the «citizen's court»53.
38 In war, some executions were related to battle. For example, at King's Mountain in the
Revolutionary War (1780), the winning rebels reacted to perceived previous refusal of the
loyalists to give quarter to defeated rebels by refusing to accept surrender and instead
Mass legal executions in America up to 1865 10
Crime, Histoire & Sociétés / Crime, History & Societies, Vol. 8, n°2 | 2004
massacring many of the British troops and supporters. They followed the massacre with
summary trials of some of the survivors, quickly followed by mass legal executions54.
39 Espionage was another war related offense punished in mass executions. The most prominent
incident served as the basis for two major films ­ The General (1926), with Buster Keaton, and
The Great Locomotive Chase (1956). Two civilians and about 20 ununiformed Union soldiers
stole a locomotive in Georgia with the intent of destroying railroad bridges on their escape
through Tennessee. As the movies portray, the men were captured, but the fact that eight men
were hanged was not featured in the films. Most of those soldiers were among the first men
awarded the new Congressional Medal of Honor55.
Indian uprisings
40 There were relatively few mass legal executions for Indian uprisings; most hostilities between
European settlers and the native population did not involve even the pretense of judicial
proceedings56. The mass executions occurred primarily after settlements had been established,
and trouble ensued as Indians reacted to what they perceived as mistreatment. The actual
mass executions occurred only near the beginning and the end of the period in question.
Massachusetts executed 8 Indians in 1676. After that, the next two recorded mass executions
of Indians occurred during the Civil War, although it is possible that mass executions of
Indians for murder in (Spanish) California in 1778, in Arkansas and Alabama in the 1830s,
and in Oregon in 1850 were actually minor uprisings57. In late 1862, the federal government,
following a military tribunal and presidential review of the initial 300 death sentences,
executed 38 Dakota Sioux in response to a series of massacres in Minnesota resulting in the
deaths of about 800 civilians58. Five Indians from the Nome Cult Reservation were executed
in Mendocino County, California, the following year, in response to civilian complaints about
«Indian outrages»59.
Slave revolts
41 Almost half of the subjects of mass legal executions during the two centuries ending with the
Civil War were involved in slave revolts, and almost all of those executed were blacks ­ mostly
slaves but a few free men. Most of those executions occurred in the nineteenth century prior to
the start of the Civil War; there were relatively few during the eighteenth century, and during
the Civil War there was decreased recourse to due process and greater use of troops to suppress
insurrections. In the case of slaves and slave revolts, there were an undetermined number
of killings without due process in addition to legal executions. Under some circumstances,
slaveholders had the authority to kill their slaves, and, even where illegal, such actions were not
apt to be punished by the state; but such punishment was generally of single slaves, not groups.
Slaveholders, in general, preferred to let the courts deal with slaves' crimes, especially group
offenses, since they could be reimbursed for executed slaves; the compensation was deemed
necessary in part to prevent slaveholders from protecting their property from the criminal
justice system. In the case of slave insurrections, many slaves were killed in putting down some
of the larger revolts, particularly those led or inspired by Gabriel in 1800, Denmark Vesey in
1822, and Nat Turner in 183160.
42 Most slave revolts, as recorded by Aptheker, resulted in the apparently lawful execution
of selected slaves rather than mere killing, although the total number executed was likely
surpassed by the number slain without a trial. Both numbers would have been dramatically
higher but for the economic pressures against destroying «property» and/or compensating
owners for such «property». The extent of due process varied and could be minimal. The
surviving record of a slave revolt in St. Peter's Parrish, Louisiana, seems limited to a teenager's
recollection: «There was a rumor afloat of a threatened insurrection among the slaves. But like
almost every other plot of the kind, the scheme failed. Information was given by one of the
negroes, wiser, or more timid than the rest. The ringleaders were seized a few hours before the
time appointed for the outbreak. They were tried without delay and ten, or a dozen, condemned
to be hanged. Their heads were cut off, stuck on poles and set up along the highway leading
from Purrysburg, the place of trial, to Coosawhatchie, the judicial capital of the District»61.
Mass legal executions in America up to 1865 11
Crime, Histoire & Sociétés / Crime, History & Societies, Vol. 8, n°2 | 2004
43 Most of the revolts resulted in relatively small numbers of slaves being executed, generally
just a few ringleaders rather than the more numerous followers, although there were several
with a dozen or more executions. Punitive focus on ringleaders may also help to explain the
vast predominance of males among those executed for slave revolts. Only about 3% of the
slaves executed were female. That focus also explains why most slave revolts did not result
in mass executions. While Aptheker records over one hundred slave revolts ­ defined by him
as involving more than merely killing as an owner or overseer, or attempting to escape, but
a planned or attempted uprising, by 10 or more persons, against the system ­ only about
one third of them resulted in mass legal executions. On the other hand, although the data
are not too reliable, that third accounted for up to 80% of executions for perceived slave
revolts. The relatively small number of slaves executed was not due to slaveholder or the
state concern about black lives, but for two other reasons. To slaveholders, slaves constituted
valuable property, not lightly to be destroyed, if selective executions were sufficient to
assure compliant behavior in the future, then other participants might suffer severe corporal
punishment (whippings, nailing an ear to a post and then removing it, etc.) and/or sale of some
slaves out of state. In addition, the executions of slaves were costly to the states, since most
state laws called for reimbursing slaveholders for property essentially taken by the state. There
was thus a desire to balance the competing goals of deterrence and frugality or economy62.
In addition ­ somewhat ironically in view of the lack of legal counsel for free blacks facing
capital charges after the Civil War ­ slaves were often entitled to counsel for capital trials63.
44 Executions of blacks for all offenses, including slave revolts, were much more common than
for whites in the South. Death was the standard sentence for slaves for a number of non
lethal offenses for which the penalty for whites was only a few years' imprisonment64. Unlike
whites, who could at least appeal for commutation, any such appeal was sometimes precluded
for blacks who were dependent upon whites to make such appeals on their behalf65. Mass
executions of blacks, however, were generally for life threatening offenses such as murder,
attempted murder, and slave revolts. Although southern whites were occasionally executed
or lynched for anti slavery or pro slave activity, whites were among those hanged in mass
executions clearly related to anti slavery activity on only four occasions: the New York City
slave revolt of 1741, aiding runaway slaves in Florida in 1846, John Brown's raid, and one
white man hanged along with three blacks in a Georgia slave revolt during the Civil War66.
45 In an effort to make the selective mass executions more effective as a future deterrent as well
as, perhaps, to indicate their disapproval of the revolts, some of the methods of execution were
more traumatic than hanging, the standard method of execution until the late nineteenth century
(except for the firing squad used for some military executions). These included beheading
slaves after execution, with the heads displayed as a permanent reminder to slaves as to what
might happen to them if they revolted; using the gibbet, thus exposing the entire body rather
than burying it; and burning, considered a sort of «super-capital punishment»67.
46 Burning had two advantages for the state and slaveholder. First, it was a more painful death
than hanging. Second, along with vengeance for the victims and the authorities, burning was
thought to reduce the likelihood of salvation of the soul. Particularly during the seventeenth and
eighteenth century, the execution of whites was an effort to punish without imposing eternal
damnation on the soul of the person executed. Although trials might be relatively speedy,
depending upon when the court regularly met relative to when a person was arrested for a
crime, executions were often delayed to allow the convicts plenty of time to make their peace
with God and to ready the soul68. But there was less concern when slaves were executed. The
delays were shorter ­ at most days instead of weeks or months ­ and, particularly with death by
fire, there was a desire to humiliate the corpse and assure «the living that the culprit's remains
would not rise whole on the Last Day of Judgment»69.
47 Even for leaders of slave revolts such executions were rare, with the desecration of the body
only imposed after death; there were still occasional recommendations that the offender spend
his remaining days «making peace with the God who you have offended ­ Your crime must
have been great but it has not placed you beyond the pale of forgiveness ­ God is merciful ­
Mass legal executions in America up to 1865 12
Crime, Histoire & Sociétés / Crime, History & Societies, Vol. 8, n°2 | 2004
Repent and save your immortal soul!»70 The judge, after enthusiastically sentencing Nat
Turner, leader of the largest slave revolt, to «be hung by the neck until you are dead! dead!
dead!», immediately added «and may the Lord have mercy upon your soul»71. Whatever may
have happened to Turner's soul, his postmortem body was reportedly skinned, with some of
the skin turned into a money purse, the skeleton going to a doctor, and the rest of the body
destroyed72.
48 The mass execution of slaves clearly demonstrated a social fear of a slave insurrection,
although widespread reporting of most perceived revolts and executions was limited.
Southerners may have feared insurrection, but they also feared that reports of insurrection
might encourage more revolts, and reports would undermine southern claims that slaves were
satisfied with their lot. Differences between Aptheker's counts, based on newspaper and
personal accounts, and those of Espy and others, based on legal documents where preserved,
indicate that, when revolts were reported, the numbers executed may have been exaggerated,
either for deterrent purposes or just expressive of a normal human tendency.
49 The most vicious punishments for convicted slaves, however, occurred outside the South and
in Louisiana during the first half of the eighteenth century. Breaking on the wheel was used
as the punishment for one or two slave revolts in Louisiana73. When four slaves killed their
owner's family in New York in 1708, execution was reportedly by torture, with the black
female slowly burned74.
50 The most painful executions were efforts to suppress revolts in New York City, first in 1712,
and then in the better known revolt of 1741. The 1712 revolt resulted in far fewer executions.
After arson, stabbing, and shooting killed 9 whites and injured another 7, about 20 black males
were executed over a period of about three months after convictions on charges of murder or
accessory to murder. The law did not specify the means of execution, so the governor opted
for selective viciousness due to the fear the revolt had created among the populace. Several
were just hanged, but one was hung in chains until he died of starvation, another broken on
the wheel, and three burned. Tom, the slave of Nicholas Roosevelt ­ the last common ancestor
of both Presidents Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt ­ was roasted slowly, the process
reportedly taking more than 8 hours75.
51 By the time about 32 persons were executed for the New York City revolt of 1741, the methods
of execution were more limited, but the panic greater. Unlike most southern revolts, where the
punishments for white conspirators were generally relatively light (whipping, banishment)76,
the New York City revolt was suppressed with the execution of 2 white females and 1 or 2
white males, all hanged. Of the 29 black males executed, 15 were burned. The white panic ­
leading to the banishing of 70 blacks and 7 whites in addition to over 30 executions in the
city and 2 executions in New Jersey for arson77 ­ is exemplified by the treatment of Johannes
Roosevelt's slave, Quack. Part of the panic was caused by the burning of the governor's
mansion (which the lieutenant governor believed to have been an accident) and various other
buildings. Quack was convicted even though Roosevelt, a prominent New Yorker who had
served on the grand jury indicting various slaves, provided the alibi that Quack was occupied at
the time of the arson of which he was accused, and thus could not have been guilty. As Quack
and another slave were prepared for execution by burning, Roosevelt suggested to Quack that
his only hope was to say he was guilty and seek a reprieve, but the mob watching the execution
refused to allow a delay for a reprieve to be considered, and the two slaves were burned78.
Conclusion
52 From early colonial days to the end of the Civil War, the mass executions of slaves indicated
the great concern of the white community over the possibility of insurrection by persons
who constituted either a substantial minority (as in New York City in the first half of the
eighteenth century and most southern states) or even a majority of the population of as an area79.
Mass execution for piracy was related mostly to the nature of the crime and its occasional
punishment, and for desertion was related to the need to establish military discipline. The other
major contributors to mass executions ­ Indian and slave uprisings and witchcraft ­ seem more
indicative of great localized fears rather than just the frequency with which particular crimes
Mass legal executions in America up to 1865 13
Crime, Histoire & Sociétés / Crime, History & Societies, Vol. 8, n°2 | 2004
were being committed. While Indian uprisings and the witch hunts were sharply limited in
time and place, the fear of slave revolts was an overriding concern wherever slavery existed
prior to the North's victory over the South.
53 Before the end of the Civil War, the study of capital punishment would show a greater use for
moral offenses in the North and property offenses in the South, discrimination against outsiders
everywhere, gradual declines in the use of the extreme sanction for non lethal offenses ­ more
than made up for by its use against murderers ­ a greater perception of offenders as different
from non offenders rather than just other sinners gone bad, and largely unsuccessful political
efforts to reduce the use of the sanction, with its imposition instead just less likely to be at a
public ceremony80. Mass legal execution, on the other hand, showed limitation only for less
frequently committed offenses (witchcraft, Indian uprisings, piracy), but greater use where
social and/or political fears were greatest, related to slavery and war. For example, incidents
of mass execution occurred roughly once every three years in the eighteenth century, twice
every three years in the antebellum nineteenth century (a period of increasing numbers of real
and feared slave revolts), and five times a year during the Civil War.
54 Following the Civil War, there was a dramatic decline in the use of mass legal execution.
There are a number of reasons for that, related to the types of crimes that tended to be punished
with mass execution and, for that matter, with capital punishment at all. The last execution
for witchcraft took place in 1779, and the last execution for piracy in 1862. Slavery ended
following the Civil War, although there remained fear of blacks and black equality in the South,
and of immigrants and labor unrest throughout the country. But for southern blacks, this meant
lynching and disproportionate use of ordinary, not mass, legal execution; nationally, blacks
accounted for one third of those executed in mass executions, but about half of all executions,
and almost three fourths of all lynchings (seven eighths of those in the South)81. During the
half century heyday of lynching (1880-1930), approximately as many blacks were lynched as
were legally executed. About 7% of those lynched were murdered in groups of four or more,
less than the antebellum percentage but higher than the percentage of postbellum mass legal
executions82. For the most part, in the final decades of the frontier, the final suppression of
the Indians was conducted by the army rather than with the use of the judicial system, and
other warfare on American soil all but ceased, and with it the need to suppress mutinies and
desertions.
55 Various changes had occurred over the decades and centuries as well. It has been suggested
that crimes became less group and more individual activities83. After a century, attacks on
capital punishment itself, while failing, had certainly limited the number of offenses for which
persons were commonly executed. By the final third of the nineteenth century and throughout
the twentieth, murder was almost the only crime for which whites were executed, and whites
were rarely executed for murder alone, but for murder with aggravating circumstances, such
as in the course of another crime, as part of a gang activity, and the like. Blacks were more
susceptible to legal executions for rape and murder, even without aggravating circumstances,
but rarely for other offenses84. Mass executions have generally been limited to the crimes for
which ordinary capital punishment is most supported, and which would remain constitutional
even following late twentieth century U.S. Supreme Court decisions requiring findings of
aggravating circumstances even for murder to warrant execution. Following the Civil War,
there were only two mass executions resulting from crimes that did not involve the loss of life:
the execution of 6 Nazi saboteurs in 1942 and the execution of 7 blacks for rape in 1951.
56 In addition to the limited number of crimes subject to capital punishment, and especially mass
execution, criminal suspects had greater rights both at trials and after, limiting the likelihood
of a death sentence being imposed. There was also a change in the way cooperative criminals
were treated. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, cooperation did not necessarily mean
exemption from execution, although the hope for clemency was a motive for cooperation. In
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was more common for those turning state's evidence
to be assured at least lesser sanctions. Felony murder convictions gradually led to fewer
executions of those who, while involved in murderous activity, did not personally take another
person's life.

57 Finally, diminished political support of capital punishment itself renders mass executions even
less appealing, even to supporters of death penalties, who would rather not have the sorts of
executions that would likely increase opposition to all capital punishment. Until the last mass
execution in 1960, and particularly for those prior to the end of the Civil War, however, mass
legal executions helped to show not just which offenses were of great concern to the public or
its leaders, but the types of crimes likely to survive as bases for ordinary executions as well,
despite the growing opposition to capital punishment during the past two centuries.

58 SOURCES: At least one source is noted for each incident, keyed below. Where A (Aptheker)
is the sole source, while one may be confident that there were executions for perceived slave
conspiracies or revolts, less confidence may be warranted for the precise date and number
executed, and regarding whether due process was observed.

85 «State» here refers to where the place of execution would currently be found, regardless of whether,
at the time of the execution, it was a colony or territory, and regardless of whether the trial was by state,
federal, or military authorities.
86 All slave revolts are classified as slave insurrection regardless of whether the actual criminal offense
was murder, arson, robbery, conspiracy, etc., and regardless of the involvement of slaves. On a smaller
scale, killing a master might be tried as petit treason, but is here murder, as is robbery-murder. A mass
murder or other violence by Indians against white settlers is categorized as an Indian uprising.
87 Gibbet is hanging with the body not promptly removed; here gibbet or beheading indicate post-mortem
actions to display (part of) the deceased as a possible deterrent. Torture involved such things as breaking
on the wheel, roasting alive, and gibbeting alive.
88 A fifth slave was acquitted of the crime, but was ordered to hang the four convicted.
89 Officially, for murder by Cayuse Indians of Presbyterian missionary/physician for witchcraft (Indian
medicine men, too, were subject to execution for bad magic), and of his wife and others, following a brief
war between settlers and natives. With competing missionaries, the hanged Indians rejected Presbyterian
rites opting instead for those of the Catholics.
90 There were also about 50 executions of white males by firing squad ­ the less insulting punishment
for desertion ­ but it is not clear that all were for desertion or any other single criminal incident.

91 Mary Surratt was probably innocent, and was executed in part due to presidential defiance of a last-
minute writ of habeas corpus, in addition to earlier recommendations for leniency. Drimmer (1990, pp.
265-272).

Résumés
Through recorded history, governments have executed persons, sometimes in groups for the
same offense. In the United States, most post trial mass executions, defined as executing four
or more persons for the same incident, occurred prior to 1866. This unstudied aspect of capital
punishment is interesting for what it tells us about the social climate of the era (colonial days
through the end of the American Civil War) in which those executions occurred and the leading
fears of the society and/or its leaders. Following the American Civil War, mass executions
not only declined in number and rate, but also matched more the trends in capital punishment
overall. A detailed list of mass legal executions in America up to 1865 is appended to this
article.

Les archives montrent que tout au long de l'histoire, les gouvernements ont pratiqué la peine
de mort, et ce parfois collectivement. Aux États-Unis, la plupart des exécutions judiciaires de
masse ­ entendues comme la mise à mort de quatre personnes au moins pour un même crime ­
sont survenues avant 1866. Cet aspect inexploré de la peine capitale est intéressant pour ce
qu'il nous révèle du climat social de l'époque (de la période coloniale à la fin de la guerre de
Sécession) des principales peurs régnant dans la société ou des craintes des dirigeants. Après
la guerre de Sécession, le nombre d'exécutions de masse a décliné en nombre et en taux, se
rapprochant des tendances de la peine de mort ordinaire. Une liste détaillée des exécutions
judiciaires de masse jusqu'en 1865 est annexée à l'article.
