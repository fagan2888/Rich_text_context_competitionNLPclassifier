Reading is not a natural task, and learning to read is not easy
(Coltheart & Prior, 2007). Although perhaps 85% of students
learn to read via home experiences and classroom instruc-
tion, approximately 15% will need additional school support
beyond that feasibly provided in the classroom (Department
of Education and Training [DET], 2010). Of that 15%, a sub-
group of perhaps 5% may need intensive support beyond that
provided within the school (DET, 2010).
While many urban areas provide families with access to
private- or government-funded services--such as speech-
language pathologists specializing in reading, cognitive and
developmental psychologists, pediatricians, specialist learn-
ing and developmental clinics, and even quality tutoring ser-
vices--these services are not often available to those who
reside in rural or remote regions of Australia. Graham and
Bailey (2007) claimed that appropriate support systems for
isolated families are not yet available, and a recent report has
identified that there is a lack of services in rural and remote
areas and suggested that the distance and costs involved in
travel to access services in the city compound the already
considerable effects of isolation (DET, 2010). The current
study reports on a pilot investigation of the effectiveness and
feasibility of using Voice Over the Internet Protocol (VoIP)
to deliver reading intervention services to children in rural
and remote regions.
VoIP is an Internet-based protocol that allows two or more
individuals to videoconference from remote locations. It is
usually freely available for users (e.g., Skype) or comes bun-
dled with computer operating systems (e.g., the Apple
Macintosh iChat software) and can be used, usually without
difficulty, by anyone with an Internet connection, a micro-
phone, and a webcam. The software chosen for this study
was iChat (Apple Computer, Inc., 2004), which comes bun-
dled with the Mac OS X operating system. iChat was chosen
because it allows screen sharing with good screen resolution.
The teacher is able to open a document on their computer
that contains the reading materials and then share their screen
with the student. The student sees a facsimile of the teacher's
display. Screen sharing also allows the teacher to provide
prompts (e.g., by highlighting parts of words using the
mouse), to make modifications to words (e.g., such as in
letter­sound manipulation games--changing sit to sat to pat
to pit and so on), and to use a blank document to present new

Voice Over the Internet Protocol
as a Medium for Delivering Reading
Intervention: Evidence From
a Single Case
Craig Wright1, 2, Elizabeth G. Conlon1, and Michalle Wright2
Abstract
Voice Over the Internet Protocol (VoIP) holds promise as a platform by which services can be delivered to students in rural
and remote regions who have reading difficulties.VoIP is an Internet-based protocol that allows two or more individuals to
videoconference from remote locations. This study used a single-case research design to investigate whether VoIP would
produce significant gains in reading ability in BM, a 10-year-old with long-standing word-level reading problems. BM was
provided with a theoretically motivated reading intervention 4 times weekly.The intervention was delivered remotely using
the Apple iChat software. Substantial growth in regular- and nonword reading covaried with onset and removal of treatment.
Treatment gains were maintained at 10-week follow-up. Meaningful gains were also seen in text-reading accuracy and reading
comprehension.VoIP-based instruction represents an important avenue for future research and is a teaching method that
holds much promise for rural and remote students.

reading stimuli (e.g., a new irregular word) in the same way
traditional teaching would use a whiteboard.
The expected advantages of VoIP are twofold. First, there
are benefits to parents and children in terms of improving
access to quality services and reducing costs. Second, there
are potential advantages for the state and economy due to the
possibility of centering instruction services around centers of
excellence rather than having intervention services spread
throughout a state or the nation. It is expected that VoIP
instruction would represent a third tier of intervention for chil-
dren with refractory reading weaknesses. Third-tier interven-
tions are the most intensive in a response-to-intervention
model and are implemented when students have not responded
to ideal class instruction and to evidence-based, small-group
instruction within the school setting (Fuchs, 2003).
Characteristics of Effective Reading
Programs
Children with refractory reading difficulties (RD) are likely
to require intensive interventions that specifically target
weaknesses within reading subsystems (e.g., Wright &
Conlon, 2009). It is generally held that students with RD
will require instruction that targets one or more of the fol-
lowing: phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, fluency,
spelling, teaching of high-frequency irregular words, and
vocabulary and comprehension strategies (e.g., Bowey,
2006; Castles & Coltheart, 2004; Department of Education,
Science and Training, 2005; National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, 2000; Reynolds, Wheldall,
& Madelaine, 2010; Torgerson, Brooks, & Hall, 2006). This
study will use Understanding Words (Wright, 2011) to
deliver reading instruction. The program allows the teacher
to provide targeted and systematic instruction in any of the
seven elements of reading instruction noted above. There is
evidence that the program produces clinically meaningful
gains in reading skills in complex populations (Wright &
Conlon, 2009; Wright, Conlon, Wright, & Dyck, 2011a,
2011b).
Study Design and Hypotheses
This study used a single-case research design with a
10-week baseline, 10-week treatment period, and 10-week
follow-up. It was predicted that growth would be negligi-
ble during baseline and that introduction of treatment
would covary with positive growth in reading ability.
Finally, it was predicted that reading growth would be less
marked when formal treatment was removed during the
maintenance period.
Method
Participant
BM was a 10-year-old, right-handed male who was in Grade
4 at a rural school. There is a history of learning difficulties
and nonspecific learning support. He was referred to a pri-
vate development psychology clinic for assessment and
treatment of reading problems.
Pretreatment Assessment
Intelligence was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence
Scale for Children­Fourth Edition (Wechsler, 2003). BM's
full-scale IQ was in the average range. Full-scale IQ is
shown in Table 1.
Oral language. Oral language skills were assessed using
the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (Semel,
Wiig, & Secord, 2003), the Test of Narrative Language (Gil-
lam & Pearson, 2004), and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test (Dunn & Dunn, 1997). Table 1 shows BM's scores on
these tests. In summary, BM had mild expressive language
weaknesses. His receptive language skills were normal.
Mathematics. The Numerical Operations subtest from the
Wechsler Individual Achievement Test­Second Edition
(Wechsler, 2003) was used to assess skill in mathematics.
BM's score was in the average range (standard score = 99),
indicating that the weaknesses in reading and language did
not extend to maths.
Attention. The Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale (DBRS;
Barkley & Murphy, 2006) was used to screen for attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The DBRS includes
two forms for parent and teacher report. Each form assesses
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th
ed.; DSM-IV;American Psychiatric association, 1994) symp-
toms of ADHD. Symptoms are rated on a 4-point scale
(never/rarely, sometimes, often, and very often). Items rated
as often or very often were scored as positive symptoms and
items rated as sometimes or never/rarely were scored as neg-
ative symptoms (Willcutt, Pennington, Olson, Chhabildas, &

his current teacher, and his teacher from the previous school
year. In summary, none of the raters reported significant
symptoms of ADHD.
Outcome Measures
Word-Level Reading Skills. Four different tests of word-
level reading skills were used. These were the Castles
and Coltheart regular-, irregular-, and nonword lists (CC2;
Castles et al., 2009) and a curriculum-based measure of non-
word decoding.
Castles and Coltheart word lists. The revised version of the
CC2 (Castles et al., 2009) was used to assess word-level
reading skills. The CC2 includes three word lists each of 40
words: regular-, irregular-, and nonwords. The test is avail-
able in two formats: a web-based version and a pencil-and-
paper PDF version (see http://www.motif.org.au). The web
version was used in the current study and was administered
face-to-face. The child is presented with the items for read-
ing aloud, one at a time, until he or she makes five consecu-
tive errors on any single item type.At that point, presentation
of that type of word list is ceased. Testing proceeds until the
child makes five consecutive errors on the final item type.
Curriculum-based nonword reading test. A curriculum-based
nonword reading test (hereafter referred to as CBM Non-
words) was constructed. The participants read 88 nonwords
constructed from each of the grapheme-to-phoneme conver-
sion (GPC) rules taught in Level A of the intervention pro-
gram (program name and reference removed to enable blind
review). The items were presented on a 13.3-inch Apple
Macintosh Macbook computer using Mac OS X v10.6 oper-
ating software. Each word was embedded in a Microsoft
Power Point file in 48-point Comic Sans font. The words
were presented to BM in slide show mode where the assessor
pressed an arrow key to introduce subsequent words after the
first word had been attempted. No feedback was provided.
Reading Comprehension. The Neale Analysis of Reading
Ability--Third Edition (NARA-III) (Neale, 1999) was admin-
istered as a measure of reading comprehension. Form 1 was
used at the initial assessment and Form 2 at the conclusion of
the 10-week treatment (r
xx
= .71 for internal consistency for
Form 1 and r
xx
= .81 for Form 2; parallel form reliability r =
.86; maximum raw score = 44). There are four questions for
the first passage and eight for each passage thereafter.
Text Reading Accuracy. The NARA-III (Neale, 1999) was
used to assess text reading accuracy. Form 1 was used at the
initial assessment and Form 2 at the conclusion of the
10-week treatment (r
xx
= .95 for internal consistency for
Forms 1 and 2; parallel form reliability r = .98; maximum
raw score = 100).
Procedure
The study was conducted under the auspices of a private
clinic, and use of the data was authorized via University
Human Research Ethics Committee arrangements. Following
the initial assessment, the family was invited to participate
in a pilot program that had the stated aim of investigating
whether VoIP could be used to deliver reading intervention
for children with RD. Following their consent, all services
were provided gratis.
All measures were administered at initial assessment. The
CBM Nonwords were administered weekly. The first author
delivered the treatment. The initial three sessions occurred
face-to-face, and thereafter, all sessions were run remotely
using VoIP. Sessions occurred 4 times weekly and ran for ~40
min (43 sessions in total). All assessments occurred face-to-
face with the exception of the weekly CBM Nonwords,
which were tested using the iChat VoIP medium.
Intervention Procedures
Teaching Program. Understanding Words (Wright, 2010)
was used to deliver reading intervention. The effectiveness
of the program for improving reading skills has been demon-
strated previously in traditional face-to-face format (Wright
& Conlon, 2009; Wright et al., 2011a, 2011b). The teaching
curriculum of Understanding Words contains seven strands:
phonological awareness, phonics, spelling, fluency, irregular
words, vocabulary, and comprehension strategies. A brief
summary of the types of activities used in each strand is pro-
vided below.
Phonological awareness. Understanding Words teaches
phonological awareness until the student can identify initial,
medial, and final phonemes in cvc, ccvc, and cvcc words and
when the student can blend and segment phonemes in vc,
cvc, ccvc, cvcc, and ccvcc words. As BM had mastered all
skills, the phonological awareness strand did not form part of
the current treatment.
Phonics. Approximately 10 min of each session was
devoted to phonics. A maximum of one new GPC rule was
introduced per session. BM was explicitly taught the new
GPC, and the act of phonological decoding was reinforced
via reading of words lists. The words in each list consisted of
the new GPC and GPCs previously mastered. The grapheme
sequence in Level A of the program is as follows: t, a, s, p, i,
n, d, o, ck, e, m, r, h, u, f, l, b, g, ai, j, oa, w, ay, ch, tch, sh, th,
qu, final "e," ng, oo, ee, x, or, igh.
Irregular words. Approximately 2 to 3 min of each session
was devoted to high-frequency irregular words (those that
cannot be or can only partially be identified using phonologi-
cal decoding strategies, for example, "put"). The words were
selected from the Children's Printed Word Database (Mas-
terton, Stuart, Dixon, & Lovejoy, 2003) and were taught
4 SAGE Open
using a combination of flashcards and spelling--methods
that have been shown to be effective in improving lexical
processing in single cases (e.g., Kohnen, Nickels, Brunsdon,
& Coltheart, 2008).
Spelling. Spelling activities occupied up to 5 min. Spelling
served two purposes. First, spelling was used to reinforce
new and old GPCs. When a new GPC was introduced, BM
was asked to spell unfamiliar regular words that included the
new GPC and previously mastered GPCs. Second, spelling
was used to reinforce the orthographic patterns in irregular
words (see above).
Fluency. Repeated oral reading of sentences and stories
was used to address fluency. The sentences and stories were
all part of the program. The sentences and stories were writ-
ten to be as decodable as possible and to contain as many of
the irregular words as possible. For example, if BM had
learned all of the single-letter sounds, that the digraph "ai"
represents/ae/and the irregular word "put," he might read the
sentence: "Ted put his bag on the train." These activities
comprised 5 to 10 min of session time.
Vocabulary. Understanding Words (Wright, 2010) uses a
method for teaching vocabulary that borrows from Correc-
tive Reading (e.g., Engelmann, Osborn, & Hanner, 1999)
and the rich vocabulary approach (e.g., McKeown & Beck,
2004). BM was taught that many English words can have
multiple meanings depending on context and that the best
clues to the meaning of a novel word can be found in sen-
tence context. The teacher then presents a target word (pro-
duce) in a sentence (e.g., Maggie helped her Mum produce a
chocolate cake). BM was asked to use the context to identify
the meaning of the target produce. The activity continues
with a discussion of things BM has produced himself or
things he owns that have been produced by others. Finally,
the target produce was placed in oral sentences, and BM had
to repeat the sentence using a synonym (e.g., Maggie helped
her Mum produce a chocolate cake).
Oral sentence comprehension. The student engages in oral
comprehension of simple and then complex sentences. For
example, the activities begin with simple subject­verb sen-
tences (Dad drove) and BM was asked questions that had to
be answered specifically (e.g., Who drove [Dad]; What did
Dad do? [Drove]). Later activities present subject­predicate
sentences (Dad drove to work; What did Dad do? [Drove];
Who drove? [Dad]; Where did Dad drive? [To work]) and
complex sentences (Dad drove to work because he was lazy;
What did Dad do? [Drove]; Who drove? [Dad]; Where did
Dad drive? [To work]; Why did Dad drive to work? [Because
he was lazy]; Who is lazy? [Dad]). BM was taught similar
strategies for "understanding" passive sentences and how
words such as before, after, as, during, when, then, during,
under, over, above, below, first, and next contribute to sen-
tence meaning.
Inference activities. Inference activities begin by teaching
that sentences do not always include all the information we
might need for comprehension. For example, BM repeated
the sentence "Kate hates eating toast at breakfast" and was
asked specific questions about sentence meaning (see sen-
tence comprehension above). He was then asked whether the
sentence tells why Kate hates toast and whether Kate eats
cereal for breakfast (the answer being no to both). The
teacher then explained that sentences provide facts but that
sometimes we have to go beyond what the sentence tells us
directly to help with comprehension. BM then learned how
to play a "Yes, No, Maybe" game in which he repeated a
sentence (e.g., Jack ate all his lunch) and was then asked
questions to which he had to answer yes, no, or maybe. The
maybe questions (e.g., Did Jack have yoghurt for lunch?) tap
information that is not contained in the sentence. The notion
of drawing an inference is then introduced by using words
such as all, some, always, and sometimes. For example, BM
might repeat "Jack ate all his lunch" and was then asked
"Was there anything left in his lunchbox?" (No). BM then
began to make cohesive inferences by providing him with
two facts (e.g., All cats are black; Snowy is a cat) and requir-
ing him to answer a question that required an inference based
on the facts (e.g., What else do we know about Snowy? She/
He is . . . black).
Reading comprehension. The oral sentence comprehension
method described above is carried into reading after the oral
method is mastered. BM read sentences (e.g., The dog dug a
hole in the backyard) and then read and answered questions
that required specific answers: "What dug?" (The dog),
"What did the dog do?" (Dug), "What did the dog dig?" (A
hole), Where did the dog dig a hole? (In the backyard), and
"What did the dog do in the backyard?" (Dug a hole).
Treatment delivery. The study used an Apple Macintosh
platform with the Mac OS X operating system. Videoconfer-
encing and screen sharing was accomplished with the iChat
AV v.3 (Apple Computer, Inc., 2004), a software program
bundled with Mac OS X (Version 10.4.3).
Results
BM's scores in the baseline period, after the 10-week inter-
vention, and at 10-week follow-up are shown in Figures 1
and 2.
Baseline Data and Reading Growth
BM had poor lexical and nonlexical reading skills. His z
score on the CC2 irregular-word test was -2.17 (second
percentile). His nonword reading score from the CC2 was
-2.68 (lesser than first percentile). Text-reading accuracy
from the NARA-III was in the first percentile and reading
comprehension in the second percentile.
Growth on the CBM Nonwords measure over each of the
three 10-week stages of the study (baseline, treatment, and
maintenance) is shown graphically in Figure 1. Little growth
in nonword reading occurred during baseline. In contrast,
substantial improvement occurred over the treatment period.
Wright et al. 5
There was also an upward trend in the maintenance period;
however, the growth slope was substantially shallower than
when formal treatment was being provided.
Figure 2 shows gains made on the CC2 word-reading lists
over the three 10-week stages of the study. There was little
growth in any of the different types of word-reading skills
across baseline. In contrast, sharp improvements can be seen
during the treatment period on the CC2 regular- and non-
word-reading measures. These gains were maintained at the
conclusion of the 10-week maintenance period. There was
no obvious trend for gains in irregular-word reading at any
stage of the study.
Quantitative Analysis of Reading Gains
To assess BM's reading gains quantitatively, it was neces-
sary to adopt a rule of thumb against which the clinical
significance of changes could be compared. Some studies
have used posttreatment status (e.g., a posttest standard
score of 90) as a benchmark for clinically significant
response to intervention (Torgesen, 2000; Torgesen et al.,
2001). However, this method may obscure the amount of
reading growth in response to intervention (Fuchs, 2003). To
assess the clinical significance of BM's reading growth, we
obtained the standard deviation of the relevant raw score
distribution for the CC2 word-reading tests (Castles et al.,
2009) and the NARA-III text-reading accuracy and reading
comprehension tests (Neale, 1999). These data were obtained
from the test manuals. The CC2 SD was based on a 10- to
10.5-years-aged cohort, and the NARA-III SD was based on
a grade-level cohort.
The criterion then required BM to make change of 0.8 of
a standard deviation from the highest of the two baseline
measures to posttreatment. The 0.8 standard deviations rule
of thumb was selected because it represents a large effect
size (Cohen, 1992).
BM made >0.8 of a standard deviation change from base-
line to posttreatment on all measures except the CC2 irregu-
lar-word list. The amount of change on each measure with
the exception of CC2 irregular-words list was equivalent to a
strong effect (Cohen, 1992).
Posttreatment Reading Status
At 10-week maintenance, BM's z score on the CC2 regular-
word test was -1.32 (9th percentile). His z score on the
irregular-word test was -2.48 (1st percentile). His nonword
reading score from the CC2 was -1.4 (8th percentile). Text-
reading accuracy from the NARA-III was in the 4th percen-
tile and reading comprehension in the 10th percentile at
posttreatment.
Treatment Satisfaction
BM's mother indicated being satisfied with his response dur-
ing the treatment. She also indicated that she was very satis-
fied withVoIPas a platform for delivering reading instruction.
She identified that it allowed BM to access services to which
he might not otherwise have had access. She also identified
costs savings in terms of travel and savings in time because
the instruction was delivered within the home.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to provide a pilot investiga-
tion of whether VoIP provides a platform via which effective
reading instruction can be delivered to students in rural and
remote regions. The preliminary answer is yes. The inter-
vention covaried with substantial gains in the ability to rec-
ognize and/or phonologically decode novel words. Gains
in regular- and nonword reading also covaried with substan-
tial improvements in text-reading accuracy and reading
comprehension.

Was Growth Due to theTreatment?
Provided sufficient experimental controls are employed,
single-case research allows conclusions to be drawn about
treatment effectiveness. Indeed, single-case research is con-
sidered a rigorous scientific method that can form part of the
process of establishing evidence-based practices (Horner et
al., 2005). In single-case research, an independent variable
(e.g., reading intervention) is systematically varied to docu-
ment a functional relationship between independent and
dependent variables. Performance during treatment is con-
trasted with performance during, preferably, multiple base-
lines and untreated periods. An experimental effect is
demonstrated when predicted change in a dependent vari-
able (e.g., improvements in reading) covaries with manipu-
lation of the independent variable (onset and/or cessation of
intervention; Horner et al., 2005).
In this study, little growth was seen during the no-treat-
ment baseline. In contrast, substantial growth in regular- and
nonword reading was seen in the 10-week treatment phase.
Furthermore, removing treatment during the maintenance
substantially slowed growth in all word-level skills. This
covariation of treatment onset and removal with growth and
nongrowth in reading therefore provides evidence that the
effects were due to the treatment itself and not due to some
other psychosocial variable.
While a single case on its own cannot be considered to
provide strong support for evidence-based practice, this
study at least provides preliminary evidence that VoIP-based
instruction can be effective. Furthermore, the current results
indicate that VoIP-based instruction is an important area for
future investigation.
DifferentTypes of Reading Improvement
The principle gains seen in this study were in regular- and
nonword reading. This is unsurprising given the emphasis on
phonics. In contrast, irregular-word reading remained static
throughout the three phases of the study. The simple expla-
nation for this is that while irregular words were taught in
the intervention program, they were not the same words as
on the CC2 test. By their very nature, irregular words cannot
be decoded using phonological information (at least not
completely), and irregular-word training may not generalize
to untaught words (Broom & Doctor, 1995).
Gains were seen in text-reading accuracy and reading
comprehension that were equivalent to a strong effect size
(Cohen, 1992). However, conclusions about these skills must
be tempered by the fact that only pre­post measures of these
skills were acquired. There is therefore less evidence for
their covariation with onset and removal of treatment than
there is for the word-level skills discussed above.
Nevertheless, they at least provide preliminary hope that
VoIP-based instruction can also deliver meaningful gains in
text-reading and comprehension.
Advantages ofVoIP
It is unlikely that VoIP will produce better gains than tradi-
tional face-to-face teaching or therapy (although it may
produce comparable gains). However, where such services
are unavailable, it may represent an effective alternative. Its
advantages seem to lie mainly in ease of access and lower
costs. The treatment in this study was delivered from a num-
ber of remote locations--the first author ran teaching ses-
sions from his office, from home, and in other locations
while away on business. BM was able to videoconference
from a room at his school, at home, and when away on a
family trip. It was time-effective in that there was no travel
to a mutual venue for either teacher or student. The sessions
simply involved logging onto iChat using an Internet con-
nection. This ease of use may represent advantages for
future government and nongovernment projects because
teaching can be delivered from anywhere, thus reducing
costs. Second, while some children who have RD will
respond quickly to an outreach service such as that mooted
by the New South Wales (NSW) Centre for Effective
Reading, there will remain a significant minority who will
have refractory reading problems. These children will
require significant and intensive intervention and support
from their parent school and possibly from private bodies
outside of school. Unfortunately, this intervention and sup-
port is not always available in many rural and remote loca-
tions. While the recent DET review associated with the
NSW Centre for Effective Reading (DET, 2010) has noted
the need for effective professional development and for
training young teachers in evidence-based practices, there is
still no guarantee that sufficient skill or the time and finan-
cial resources to deploy that skill effectively will be avail-
able "at the coalface" in rural and remote schools. If VoIP
proves effective in larger studies, it may allow government
or nongovernment organizations to concentrate teaching
assets in one or several locations and thus ensure that quality
teaching services are provided to children in rural and
remote regions. Finally, VoIP could also be a useful tool in
an urban area to reduce travel time and costs for parents. It
would allow reading specialists to provide services to a
larger client base due to reduced travel time.
Limitations and Future Research
The principle limitation is inherent in the single-case design.
It is not clear from a single case just how far the results will
generalize. Future research will be required using students
who have a range of characteristics to determine which chil-
dren respond best to this novel treatment delivery format.
For example, it may be that students who have ADHD may
not respond as well because VoIP makes it more difficult,
relative to face-to-face teaching, to manage inattentive and/
or challenging behavior. This could be accomplished using a
multiple case-series design. Studies should also investigate
Wright et al. 7
the characteristics of teachers who provide the best instruc-
tion via VoIP. Future research should also use control group
designs to investigate whether VoIP has comparable efficacy
to face-to-face teaching. Finally, the intensity of the current
intervention delivered by a skilled teacher will not be easy
to replicate in the real world. It is more likely that students
will receive a less intensive intervention (e.g., one to two
sessions per week). Future studies should seek to determine
the minimum intensity required to make meaningful change.
Studies should also investigate whether parents are capable
of increasing the intensity of therapist-led intervention by
administering treatment between therapist sessions.
