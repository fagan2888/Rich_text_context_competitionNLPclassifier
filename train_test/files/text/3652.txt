Introduction
Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to promote athero-
sclerosis1,2 by activating various signaling pathways and
augmenting oxidative stress via type 1 receptor (AT1
) activa-
tion,3,4 which leads to increased expressions of the redox-
sensitive genes involved in atherogenesis.5,6 In contrast, the
effect of Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2
) on atherogenesis
remains controversial. Daugherty et al. demonstrated that
AT2
antagonist treatment exaggerated Ang II-induced ather-
osclerosis in apoE-/- mice7; however, studies using AT2
-
deficient mice showed conflicting results. Daugherty et al.
showed that AT2
deficiency did not affect atherosclerosis in
low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient mice,8
whereas Iwai et al. reported that the atherosclerotic lesion
area was significantly enhanced in AT2
/apoE double-defi-
cient mice through the exacerbation of oxidative stress.9
These results raise concerns about the AT2
-medited anti-
atherogenic effect of long-term treatment with Ang II
receptor blockers (ARB) or compound 21 (C21), a recently
developed orally active non-peptide and selective AT2
agonist.10
The expression of AT2
is known to be restricted in the
adult cardiovascular system, with lower expression levels
relative to the AT1
receptor, while it is up-regulated in vari-
ous pathological conditions including post-myocardial
infarction, heart failure, and arterial injury.11­13 It was

Abstract
Introduction: The angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor exerts pro-atherogenic action by augmenting oxidative stress,
whereas the Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2
)-mediated effect on atherosclerosis remains controversial.
Materials and methods: AT2
transgenic (AT2
-Tg) mice, which overexpress AT2
in their vascular smooth muscle cells, were
crossed with apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) mice to generate AT2
transgenic apoE-/- mice (AT2
-Tg/apoE-/-).
Results: A subpressor dose of Ang II infusion exaggerated atherosclerosis development in apoE-/- mice, which was mark-
edly suppressed in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice. Inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (L-NAME) or bradykinin type 2 receptor
completely abolished AT2
-mediated anti-atherogenic actions. The vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression levels
and degree of monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the intima were also considerably reduced in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice;
these phenomena were completely reversed by L-NAME treatment. Ang II infusion significantly enhanced the accumula-
tion of dihydroethidium-positive mononuclear cells in the intima and mRNA expression levels of Nox2, a phagocytic
cell-type NADPH oxidase subunit in apoE-/- mice, which was completely inhibited in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice.
Conclusions: Vascular AT2
stimulation exerts anti-atherogenic actions in an endothelial kinin/NO-dependent manner,
and its anti-oxidative effect is likely to be exerted by inhibiting the accumulation of superoxide-producing mononuclear
leukocytes.

medial layer of the aorta and in endothelial cells of resistant
arteries,14 and it is also up-regulated in the aortas of apoE-/-
mice on an atherogenic diet.9,15 We previously generated
AT2
transgenic (AT2
-Tg) mice featuring targeted AT2
over-
expression in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)
and demonstrated that AT2
in VSMCs promotes intracellu-
lar acidosis by blocking the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+
exchanger, leading to kininogenase activation followed by
bradykinin release from VSMCs, resulting in endothelial
nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation and an anti-pres-
sor response to Ang II.16 These findings lead to the hypoth-
esis that AT2
in the aortic medial layer exerts its
anti-atherogenic action through endothelial bradykinin/NO
system activation.
In this study, we crossed AT2
-Tg mice with apoE-/- mice
to generate vascular AT2
-overexpressing apoE-/- (AT2
-Tg/
apoE-/-) mice in an effort to elucidate the involvement of
the kinin/NO system in the observed AT2
-mediated anti-
atherogenic action. We found that vascular AT2
activation
exerts its anti-atherogenic action in an endothelial kinin/
NO-dependent manner accompanied by decreased oxida-
tive stress through decreased accumulation of superoxide-
producing mononuclear leukocytes. Our findings support
the notion that direct AT2
activation could be a potential
therapeutic option for preventing the development of ath-
erosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.
Materials and methods
Animal preparation
AT2
-Tg mice (C57BL/6) overexpressing the AT2
under con-
trol of the -smooth muscle actin promoter were generated
as described previously.16 Homozygous AT2
-Tg mice were
crossed with homozygous apoE-/- mice (C57BL/6) to yield
double heterozygous mice. These heterozygous littermates
were bred with apoE-/- mice to establish AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice
(backcrossed>10 times). Male apoE-/- mice and AT2
-Tg/
apoE-/- mice were weaned at 5 weeks of age onto a high-
cholesterol diet (21% fat, 0.125% cholesterol; Oriental Yeast
Co., Tokyo, Japan) that was maintained for 8 weeks. Starting
at the age of 8 weeks, a subpressor dose ofAng II (100 ng/kg/
min) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was administered
for 4 weeks using an osmotic minipump. Before the implan-
tation of osmotic minipumps, mice were anesthetized with a
single intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and
xylazine (8 mg/kg). Sufficient anesthesia depth was con-
firmed by the lack of a tail pinch response.Additional groups
of 8-week-old apoE-/- and AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice were treated
with either L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME;
1 mg/ml in drinking water) or the bradykinin receptor inhibi-
tor icatibant (70 mg/kg/day, osmotic minipump) in parallel
with the Ang II infusion.
Before the aortic tissues were isolated, the mice were sac-
rificed by transcardiac perfusion under terminal anesthesia
by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg).
All investigations conformed to the Guidelines for Animal
Experiments of the Kyoto Prefectural University of
Medicine. The experiments were also approved by a local
university ethics review board.
Membrane preparation and receptor assay
Membrane fractions were prepared from pooled aortic sam-
ples and incubated with different concentrations (0.05­1 nM)
of [125I]Sar1, Ile8-Ang II, or [125I]CGP42112Afor 120 min at
20°C for the saturation experiment as described previously.17
Specific binding of [125I]Sar1, Ile8-Ang II, and [125I]
CGP42112A was determined from the difference between
counts in the absence of 10 µmol/l AT1
antagonist (losartan)
and the presence of 1 µmol/l AT2
antagonist (CGP42112A).
Kd
and Bmax
values were estimated by Rosenthal analysis of
the saturation data, while the AT1
and AT2
densities were cal-
culated from the Bmax
values.
Hemodynamic analysis
Mean blood pressure and heart rate were measured under
conscious and unrestrained conditions using a programma-
ble sphygmomanometer (BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan).
Plasma lipid analysis
Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were deter-
mined using an automated chemistry analyzer (Wako
Chemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan). LDL-cholesterol levels were
quantified by an enzymatic reaction using a commercially
available kit (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Quantitative measurement of atherosclerotic
lesions
The mice were euthanized at 12 weeks of age and the ath-
erosclerotic lesions were analyzed as described previ-
ously.18 Image analysis was performed on Oil Red O-stained
aortas using Scion Imaging software. The aortic lesion area
in each animal was measured as the percentage of lesion
area per total aortic area.
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical analysis and superoxide product
evaluation,AngIIwasadministeredfor2weekstotheapoE-/- and
AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice from the age of 8 weeks. The aortic arch
was rapidly removed after PBS perfusion, embedded in opti-
mal cutting temperature compound, and quick-frozen in liquid
nitrogen. The atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch region
were examined at five locations at 100 µm intervals, and nine
serial 6 µm-thick sections were prepared from each location,
stained immunohistochemically with fluorescein isothiocy-
anate (FITC)- or tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate
Takata et al. 313
(TRITC)-conjugated antibodies against vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1 (VCAM-1; clone 429, Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA) and monocyte/macrophage antibody-2 (MOMA-2;
Serotec, Oxford, UK), and then observed using a confocal
microscope (FLUOVIEW FV300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
As a negative control, non-immune immunoglobulin and
FITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were used.
Positive VCAM-1 and MOMA-2 staining was evaluated using
image-analysissoftware.ThepercentagecoverageofVCAM-1
in the total aortic area and the MOMA-2 staining area were
assessed in five sections from six animals in each group.
In situ detection of superoxide anions
Fresh-frozen cross-sections of the ascending aorta (30 µm
each) were incubated with dihydroethidium (DHE) (1 µM)
in PBS for 30 min at 37°C in a humidified chamber pro-
tected from light.19 To detect the ethidium, samples were
examined using a fluorescence microscope equipped with
a computer-based imaging system. The fluorescence
intensity was pixilated and quantified using Scion Image
software.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction
The thoracic aortas of the mice were dissected and the total
RNA was isolated. Real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) was performed using a LightCycler ST300
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) with SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix and RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) as described previously.20 The dissocia-
tion curves were monitored to check for the aberrant primer
dimers formation. PCR-amplified products were electro-
phoresed on 2% agarose gels to confirm the presence of a
single band. Data are expressed as levels relative to apoE-/-
mice with PBS treatment.
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate oxidase activity
Protein samples were extracted from aortas after 1 week of
Ang II infusion, and incubated for 30 min in Krebs-HEPES
buffer at 37°C. The rings were transferred to scintillation
vials containing 100 µmol/l L-012 in Krebs-HEPES buffer
and incubated for 5 min at 37°C in the dark. After incuba-
tion, chemiluminescence was measured using a luminom-
eter (Lumat LB 9507; Berthold Technologies Ltd) over a
period of 10 min at 1 min intervals. After measurement,
100 µmol/l nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO) was added
and the rings were further incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
L-012 chemiluminescence was expressed as relative light
units per milligram of dry tissue weight per minute.
NADPH oxidase activity was quantified from the absorb-
ance with or without NADPH.
Measurement of Ca2+-dependent NO
synthase activity
Protein samples were extracted from the aortas after 1 week of
Ang II infusion. NO synthase (NOS) activity was measured
using the conversion rate of radio-labeled L-[3H] citrulline
from L-[3H] arginine (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK).21
Duplicate incubations were performed for 60 min at room
temperature for each sample in the presence or absence of
ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (2 mmol/l) to determine the
Ca2+-dependent NOS activity.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as means ± SE. Mean values were
compared using analysis of variance. If a statistically sig-
nificant effect was found, Scheffe's F test was performed to
detect the difference between groups. Values of p<0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
Expression of AT2
in the aortas of AT2-Tg/
apoE-/- mice
We generated five different AT2
-Tg lines and then crossed
AT2
-Tg901 and AT2
-Tg902 mice, which expressed aortic
AT2
most abundantly, with apoE-/- mice. As the findings
obtained from AT2
-Tg901/apoE-/- and AT2
-Tg902/apoE-/-
mice were similar, we here described the result from
AT2
-Tg901/apoE-/- that expressed aortic AT2
(10.1 ± 1.8
fmol/mg protein) (Supplemental Figure 1) more abundantly
than AT2
-Tg902/apoE-/- mice (8.9 ± 1.2 fmol/mg protein).
The proportion of aortic AT2
relative to AT1
was 33% ±
0.1%, identical to that in AT2
-Tg901 mice aortas (39% ±
0.2 %). AT2
was not detected in the aortas of apoE-/- mice,
and there were no significant differences in aortic AT1
receptor density between apoE-/- and AT2
-Tg901/apoE-/-
mice (Supplemental Figure 1). The Kd
value (nmol/l) of
AT2
in the aorta from AT2
-Tg901/apoE-/- mice was 0.39 ±
0.05, similar to that in AT2
-Tg901 (0.31 ± 0.01). These ani-
mals had similar weights relative to their control littermates
(designated as apoE-/- mice), and there was no evidence of
obvious morphological changes of the aorta.
Vascular AT2
activation inhibits
atherosclerosis development in apoE-/- mice
We first compared the atherosclerotic lesion area between
apoE-/- and AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice fed a high-cholesterol
diet for 8 weeks; however, no significant difference was
observed between groups. We next examined the effect of
a subpressor dose of Ang II (100 ng/kg/min) on athero-
sclerotic lesion development. Atherosclerotic lesion area
was markedly increased in apoE-/- mice (from 3.0% ±
0.4% to 14.5% ± 1.6%, p<0.001); however,Ang II-induced
314 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)
atherosclerotic lesion development was substantially
reduced by 53% in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice (p<0.05) (Figures
1(a) and 1(b)), suggesting that activation of the vascular
AT2
exerts anti-atherogenic actions. Hemodynamic
parameters and lipid profiles did not differ between the
two groups (Supplemental Figures 2A and 2B).
Blockade of the bradykinin/NO system by
L-NAME or icatibant abolishes AT2
-mediated
anti-atherogenic actions
We previously demonstrated that targeted overexpression
of the AT2
in VSMCs exerted an antipressor response to
Ang II through a kinin/NO-dependent mechanism.16 To
elucidate the involvement of the kinin/NO system in AT2
-
mediated anti-atherogenic actions, L-NAME or icatibant
was administered in combination with the Ang II infusion.
Co-treatment with L-NAME did not affect the Ang
II-induced atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice; how-
ever, the lesion area in L-NAME-treated AT2
-Tg/apoE-/-
mice was significantly increased to a similar extent as that
seen in apoE-/- mice (13.6% ± 1.0% vs. 12.1% ± 1.6%,
apoE-/- vs. AT2
-Tg/apoE-/-; p=n.s.) (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).
Similarly, the AT2
-mediated anti-atherogenic action
observed in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice was completely reversed
by icatibant treatment. Considering that the bradykinin
type 2 receptor is exclusively expressed in the endothe-
lium, these results suggest that the endothelial bradykinin/
NO system is likely to be involved in AT2
-mediated anti-
atherogenic action.
Vascular AT2
activation increases Ca2+-
dependent NOS activity in apoE-/- mice
To further elucidate the activation of an endothelial brad-
ykinin/NO system in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice, Ca2+-
dependent NOS activity in the aorta was examined after
1 week of Ang II infusion, in which few adhesive mono-
nuclear cells were observed in the intima (data not
shown). In the absence ofAng II infusion, Ca2+-dependent
NOS activity did not differ between the two groups of
mice (Figure 3). In contrast, Ang II infusion into AT2
-Tg/
apoE-/- mice markedly increased Ca2+-dependent NOS
activity (67% increase vs. PBS infusion, p<0.01), but had
no effect on that in apoE-/- mice. This finding further sup-
ports the notion that the AT2
-mediated enhancement of
NOS activation and the subsequent NO production
through an endothelial kinin/NO-dependent mechanism
play a critical role in AT2
-mediated anti-atherogenic
action.

Vascular AT2
inhibits Ang II-inducedVCAM-
1 expression and monocyte/macrophage
accumulation
In the early stage of atherosclerosis, activated endothe-
lial cells expressing various kinds of adhesion molecules
such as VCAM-1 play a critical role in the accumulation
of mononuclear cells within the intima.22 Since
endothelium-derived NO has been shown to inhibit
adhesion molecule expression,23 we examined VCAM-1
expression levels and monocyte/macrophage accumula-
tion by immunochemistry after 2 weeks of Ang II infu-
sion. In the absence of Ang II, the VCAM-1 expression
was equivalent between the two groups of mice.
Consistent with the previous data,24 Ang II infusion sig-
nificantly increased the expression of VCAM-1 on the

was added in the drinking water of mice in parallel with Ang II (100 ng/kg/min). Icatibant (70 µg/kg per day) was co-infused with

inner surface and medial wall in apoE-/- mice, whereas it was
markedly inhibited in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice (Figures 4(a)
and 4(b)). Similarly, Ang II-induced monocyte/mac-
rophage accumulation in the luminal surface was signifi-
cantly decreased in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice compared with
apoE-/- mice (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)), suggesting that aug-
mented NO production inhibits VCAM-1 expression,
resulting in attenuated accumulation of monocytes/mac-
rophages in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice.
We also examined the effects of L-NAME on Ang
II-induced VCAM-1 expression and monocyte/mac-
rophage accumulation. L-NAME treatment further
increased Ang II-induced VCAM-1 expression in both
apoE-/- and AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice; however, the extent was
much larger in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice than in apoE-/- mice.
Consequently, there was no significant difference in
VCAM-1-positive area between apoE-/- and AT2
-Tg/apoE-/-
mice after L-NAME treatment (Supplemental Figure 3A).
Similarly, L-NAME treatment markedly augmented Ang
II-induced monocyte/macrophage accumulation in
AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice to the same extent as that in apoE-/-
mice (Supplemental Figures 3B and 3C). These findings
further supported the current hypothesis that vascular AT2
overexpression exerts anti-atherogenic action through an
endothelial kinin/NO system.
Vascular AT2
attenuates Ang II-induced
oxidative stress by inhibiting the
accumulation of superoxide-producing
mononuclear leukocytes
To elucidate the manner in which AT2
counteracts AT1
-
mediated oxidative stress, cell-specific generation of super-
oxide anions was examined. In the absence of Ang II, the
fluorescence intensity of DHE-positive mononuclear cells
in the intima did not differ between apoE-/- and AT2
-Tg/
apoE-/- mice (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). In contrast, 2 weeks of
Ang II infusion into apoE-/- mice significantly increased the
fluorescence intensity, particularly in the intima, which was
completely inhibited in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice. Consistent
with this finding, the mRNA expression level of Nox2,
phagocytic NADPH oxidase,25 was markedly increased in
apoE-/- mice (5.1-fold vs. PBS; p<0.05) after Ang II infu-
sion (Supplemental Figure 4A), but was significantly
reduced in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice, suggesting that AT2
-
mediated anti-oxidative action is mostly exerted by inhibit-
ing the accumulation of superoxide-producing mononuclear
leukocytes.
We also examined the activity of NADPH oxidase after
1 week of Ang II infusion, at which time few adhesive
mononuclear cells were observed in the intima (data not
shown), and found no significant difference between the
two groups of mice (Supplemental Figure 4B). These find-
ings suggest that vascular-targeted overexpression of AT2
exerts its anti-oxidative action by attenuating the accumula-
tion of superoxide-producing mononuclear leukocytes
rather than by a direct effect on vascular NADPH oxidase
activity.
Discussion
This is the first study to indicate that targeted overexpres-
sion of AT2
in VSMCs significantly attenuates atheroscle-
rotic lesion development in an endothelial kinin/
NO-dependent manner. We previously demonstrated that
AT2
stimulation in VSMCs promotes intracellular acidosis
by blocking the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger,
leading to activation of kininogenases followed by brady-
kinin release, which causes endothelial NO-dependent vas-
odilation in mice.16 Accumulating evidence supports the
notion that the AT2
stimulates a vasodilator signaling cas-
cade that includes bradykinin, NO, and guanosine cyclic 3',
5'-monophosphate.26 The present study using AT2
-Tg/
apoE-/- mice provides new evidence that the AT2
bradykinin
NO system exerts its anti-atherogenic action by attenuating
the increased VCAM-1 expression and monocyte/mac-
rophage accumulation, both of which are essentially
involved in the early stage of atherosclerosis development.
Furthermore, the protective effect ofAT2
on oxidative stress
was mostly exerted through reduced accumulation of
superoxide-producing mononuclear leukocytes rather than

by a direct effect on vascular NADPH oxidase activity.
These findings provide new insight into the AT2
-mediated
anti-atherogenic actions and support the possibility that
direct AT2
activation could be a potential therapeutic strat-
egy for preventing the development of atherosclerotic car-
diovascular diseases.
AT2
is substantially expressed by endothelial cells of
the microvasculature,27,28 whereas its expression in larger
arteries such as the thoracic aorta was barely detectable by
a conventional binding assay or immunohistochemis-
try.16,28 However, an autoradiography study revealed that a
low level of aortic AT2
expression was detected in the cell
layer at the medial­adventitial border rather than the
medial­endothelial wall.29 Similarly, using a newly devel-
oped polyclonal anti-AT2
antiserum, Utsunomiya et al.14
reported that AT2
expression was observed only in the aor-
tic muscular medial layer and not in the endothelium.
Furthermore, both AT1
and AT2
expression were up-regu-
lated in the aortas of apoE-/- mice fed an atherogenic
diet.9,15 Sales et al. showed that the mRNA expression of
the AT2
was threefold higher in apoE-/- mice fed an athero-
genic diet compared with those on standard chow diet.15
Iwai et al. also observed that the AT2
was expressed in both
the lesion and the aortic medial wall in apoE-/- mice on a
high-cholesterol diet.9 The previous in vitro studies inves-

endothelial cells showed the discordant results, which is
probably due to the difference in animal species and cell
lines to be tested. The biological relevance of these results
should be assessed in vivo experiments. From this point of
view, AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice in which AT2
is overexpressed
in aortic VSMCs might be a suitable model for investing
the vascular action of aortic AT2
in atherogenesis. Our
findings suggest that AT2
receptor in VSMCs plays a criti-
cal role in atherogenesis, especially in hypercholester-
olemia which elicits re-expression of the aortic AT2
in the
medial cell layer including VSMCs.
Studies investigating the effect of AT2
on the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis showed conflicting results. AT2
exerted an anti-atherogenic effect in AT2
/apoE double-defi-
cient mice,9 whereas no such action was observed in AT2
/
LDL double-deficient mice.15 These discrepancies most
likely resulted from the different stages of atherosclerosis
investigated. For example, the atherosclerotic lesion areas in
AT2
/apoE double-deficient mice were estimated after 10
weeks on a high-cholesterol diet, corresponding to the early
stage of atherosclerosis, whereas the AT2
/LDL double-defi-
cient mice were analyzed at 5 months of age, at which point
the plaque evolution was further advanced. Similarly,
Daugherty et al. demonstrated thatAT2
antagonist PD123319
treatment exaggerated the Ang II-induced atherosclerotic
lesion area in 2-month-old apoE-/- mice, whereas no such
effect was observed at the age of 11 months.7
Long-term treatment with a Western diet has been shown
to impair endothelial function in apoE-/- mice.30,31
Considering that Ang II-induced Ca2+-dependent NOS
activity was enhanced in AT2
-Tg/apoE-/- mice, the AT2
-
mediated anti-atherogenic effect is likely to be exerted in
the early stage of atherosclerosis, during which endothelial
function was preserved. Therefore, it is of great importance
that the tissue-specific effect and time-dependent action of
vascular AT2
is carefully considered for estimating AT2
-
mediated anti-atherogenic actions in the multifactorial pro-
cess of atherosclerosis.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO are crucial for
the development of atherosclerosis.32 AT2
has been shown
to both increase NO production16 and inhibit ROS produc-
tion9; however, the precise mechanism for AT2
-mediated
modulation of oxidative stress remains to be determined.
Iwai et al.9 demonstrated that the AT2
blocker PD123319
augmented Ang II-induced NADPH oxidase activity in rat
fetal VSMCs, suggesting that the anti-atherogenic effect of
AT2
occurs, in part, through the inhibitory effect on NADPH
oxidase activation, a dominant source of oxidative stress in
the vasculature.25 However, the present study did not show
an inhibitory effect of AT2
on NADPH oxidase activity

Superoxide levels were calculated as the ratio (fold increase) to the control values obtained from sequential unstained sections from
each mouse.The bar graphs represent the mean ± SE relative to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated apoE-/- mice set at 100%.
At least 6 mice were tested in each group. *p<0.05 vs. vessels from PBS-treated apoE-/- mice. #p<0.05 vs. vessels from Ang II-treated
apoE-/- mice.

(Supplemental Figure 4B). Iwai et al. stimulated fetal
VSMCs with 10-7 M Ang II and observed a significant
increase in NADPH oxidase activity,9 while the present
study showed that a subpressor dose of Ang II did not
increase NADPH oxidase activity (Supplemental Figure 4B),
suggesting that AT2
stimulation was likely to antagonize
AT1
-mediated NADPH oxidase activity by directly inhibit-
ing crosstalk of the two receptors. Accordingly, the discrep-
ancy between these two experiments might be attributable
to the extent of AT1
-mediated augmentation of NADPH
oxidase activity.
The clinical relevance of AT2
receptor has not been con-
firmed because of the lack of a selective AT2
agonist avail-
able in clinical practice. Recently, compound 21 (C21), a
non-peptide, orally active and selective AT2
agonist has
been developed.10 Direct AT2
stimulation by C21 has been
reported to exert beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular
function in rodents through an increased production of NO
and/or suppression of the inflammatory response.33,34
Rehman et al.34 reported that endothelium-dependent relax-
ation in isolated rat aortas was enhanced in the C21­losartan
combination groups compared with losartan alone, suggest-
ing that C21 treatment increases NO production, ARB
treatment inhibits superoxide production, and both lead to
the increased NO bioavailability. Considering that the
expression of AT2
receptor is up-regulated in various patho-
logical conditions including post-myocardial infarction,
heart failure, and arterial injury,11­13 the beneficial effect of
AT2
is expected to be assessed in the future clinical trials.
Our findings strongly support the notion that direct AT2
stimulation exerts anti-atherogenic action and could be a
potential therapeutic strategy for producing a clinically
beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system.
Conclusions
AT2
activation in VSMCs markedly inhibited the initiation of
atherosclerotic lesion development in an endothelial brady-
kinin/NO-dependent manner, and AT2
-mediated modulation
of oxidative stress was mostly attributable to the enhanced
NO production and inhibited accumulation of superoxide-
producing leukocytes. These findings provide novel evi-
dence of vascular AT2
-mediated anti-atherogenic actions and
new insight into the mechanism for AT2
-mediated anti-oxi-
dative action, which could resolve the controversial issue
regarding the AT2
-mediated effect on atherosclerosis.
