Abstract
Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common opportunistic infection among HIV-infected
individuals, a major source of serious complications among organ-transplant recipients, and a leading cause
of hearing loss, vision loss, and mental retardation among congenitally infected children. Women infected
for the first time during pregnancy are especially likely to transmit CMV to their fetuses. More children
suffer serious disabilities caused by congenital CMV than by several better-known childhood maladies such
as Down syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome
Methods: Using CMV seroprevalence data from the nationally representative Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, we estimated CMV incidence among the general United States population
and among pregnant women. We employed catalytic models that used age-specific CMV seroprevalences
as cumulative markers of past infections in order to derive estimates of three basic parameters: the force
of infection, the basic reproductive rate, and the average age of infection. Our main focus was the force
of infection, an instantaneous per capita rate of acquisition of infection that approximates the incidence of
infection in the seronegative population.
Results: Among the United States population ages 12­49 the force of infection was 1.6 infections per 100
susceptible persons per year (95% confidence interval: 1.2, 2.4). The associated basic reproductive rate of
1.7 indicates that, on average, an infected person transmits CMV to nearly two susceptible people. The
average age of CMV infection was 28.6 years. Force of infection was significantly higher among non-
Hispanic Blacks (5.7) and Mexican Americans (5.1) than among non-Hispanic Whites (1.4). Force of
infection was significantly higher in the low household income group (3.5) than in the middle (2.1) and
upper (1.5) household income groups. Based on these CMV incidence estimates, approximately 27,000
new CMV infections occur among seronegative pregnant women in the United States each year.
Conclusion: These thousands of CMV infections in pregnant women, along with the sharp racial/ethnic
disparities in CMV incidence, are compelling reasons for accelerating research on vaccines and other
interventions for preventing congenital CMV disease. Nevertheless, the relatively low force of infection
provides encouraging evidence that modestly effective vaccines and rates of vaccination could significantly
reduce CMV transmission.

Background
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common opportunistic
infection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-
infected individuals, a major source of serious viral com-
plications among organ-transplant recipients, and a lead-
ing cause of hearing loss, vision loss, and mental
retardation among congenitally infected children. In fact,
more children suffer serious disabilities caused by congen-
ital CMV than by several better-known childhood mala-
dies such as Down syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome
[1].
Like other herpesviruses, primary CMV infection is fol-
lowed by the establishment of lifelong latent infection
from which periodic reactivation is common [2,3]. Symp-
toms are usually absent during primary infection and
reactivation, but CMV can be shed in various bodily secre-
tions, particularly urine and saliva [4]. CMV is transmitted
person-to-person via close non-sexual contact, sexual
activity, breastfeeding, blood transfusions, and organ
transplantation [4]. For pregnant women, important
sources of infection include sexual activity and contact
with the urine or saliva of young children, especially their
own children [5-7].
Congenital CMV infection is most likely to occur follow-
ing a primary infection in the mother during pregnancy
[8]. However, maternal CMV reactivation or reinfection
with a different CMV strain can also lead to fetal infection
[8]. Approximately 10 percent of congenitally infected
infants are symptomatic at birth, and of the 90 percent
who are asymptomatic, 10­15 percent will develop symp-
toms over months or even years [9].
Incidence of primary CMV infections has been estimated
only in small or specialized populations, such as pregnant
women or day care providers. The most comprehensive
study of CMV incidence was carried out by Griffiths and
colleagues in the United Kingdom [10], in which they esti-
mated that more than three seronegative women per 100
seroconvert each year. However, their study was limited to
pregnant women and was hospital-based rather than pop-
ulation-based. Robust, nationally representative estimates
of CMV incidence are essential for 1) assessing the burden
of primary CMV infection in the United States popula-
tion, especially among pregnant women; 2) examining
whether there are racial/ethnic disparities in primary
maternal infection rates, which might be responsible for
racial/ethnic disparities in congenital infection rates; and
3) evaluating how effective a vaccine or other intervention
must be in order to reduce the incidence of congenital
CMV disease. To obtain estimates of CMV incidence in the
United States, we employed mathematical models that
used age-specific CMV seroprevalences from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III).
Methods
Study population and design
NHANES III was conducted from 1988 to 1994 and pro-
vides nationally representative estimates of the health and
nutritional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized
population of the United States. In order to produce pop-
ulation-representative estimates, NHANES III used a
multistage, stratified, clustered sample design and gener-
ated sample weights proportional to the probability of
participant selection. All our analyses used the NHANES
III sample weights and sample design variables to correct
the CMV seroprevalence point estimates for population
representativeness and the interval estimates for the
multistage complex sample design. The study protocol
was approved by the authors' institutional review board.
More details about NHANES III can be found in the offi-
cial documentation [11]. Serologic testing for CMV
immunoglobulin G (IgG) was conducted as described
previously [12].
The main focus of our models of CMV incidence was the
age range 12­49 years. Over 90 percent of participants in
this age range had sera available for CMV testing (N =
11,859) so that seroprevalence estimates were representa-
tive of the United States population. More importantly,
this age range included women of childbearing age and so
has key relevance for congenital CMV disease. Although
surplus sera was only available for approximately 70 per-
cent of 6­11 year-olds (N = 2,679), we also ran models in
this age group to assess whether incidence rates differed
by race/ethnicity. Nationally-representative CMV sero-
prevalence estimates were not available for children less
than six years old.
Description of models
Here we give an overview of the models of CMV inci-
dence. A more detailed description is provided in the
Appendix. We employed catalytic models [13,14] that
used age-specific CMV seroprevalences as cumulative
markers of past infections in order to derive estimates of
three basic parameters: the force of infection, the basic
reproductive rate, and the average age of infection. The
force of infection is the instantaneous per capita rate of
acquisition of infection [13] and will be expressed in this
article as the number of primary CMV infections per 100
seronegative persons per year. The basic reproductive rate
is a function of the force of infection and is the average
number of secondary infections produced when one
infected individual is introduced into a host population
where everyone is susceptible. The average age of infection
is also a function of the force of infection and is the age at
which an individual in a given population typically
BMC Infectious Diseases 2007, 7:71 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/71

acquires a specific infection. We considered parameter dif-
ferences to be statistically significant when corresponding
confidence intervals did not overlap.
Force of infection can be estimated as time-dependent,
age-dependent, or both. Since our data were taken from a
single, cross-sectional survey, we could not model time
dependence. To evaluate age-dependence, we visually
inspected the slope of the age-specific seroprevalence
graph (see Appendix). We observed no extreme depar-
tures from linearity for the overall population, with the
slope appearing fairly constant as a function of age. How-
ever, because we saw age-dependent changes in slope
within some subpopulations (e.g., Figure 1), we used
piece-wise log-linear models that allowed the slope to
vary between the age groups 6­11, 12­19, and 20­49
years. With the exception of this modification for the sub-
group analysis, our final models were the time- and age-
independent ones proposed by Griffiths et al. [10] for
modeling CMV incidence, where the force of infection is
estimated as the slope of the log-linear regression line hav-
ing the seronegative prevalence as the response variable
and age as the explanatory variable. For all models age was
treated as a continuous variable.
The models made the following assumptions: CMV infec-
tion does not affect the mortality rate; seroprevalence in
newborns equals zero; the death rate is type I, meaning
everyone survives until a specific age, after which the sur-
vival probability is zero; and every person in the popula-
tion is equally susceptible (i.e., homogeneous mixing).
Variables
We estimated the model parameters for the entire United
States population and for specific population groups strat-
ified by sex, race/ethnicity, and/or household income.
Race/ethnicity was a self-reported variable that consisted
of non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Mexican

Americans and Others. As recommended in NHANES III
documentation [15], Others was excluded from the anal-
yses because the sample size was too small and encom-
passed a diverse mix of race/ethnicity. Household income
was divided into low, medium, and high, as defined pre-
viously [11,12].
Estimating risk of CMV infection during pregnancy
We estimated risk of CMV infection for seronegative
women during pregnancy as risk = 100 × [1 - e(-rate×time)],
where rate was the force of infection per 100 women per
year and time was the duration of pregnancy [16]. We
multiplied this risk by the proportion of women who are
CMV seronegative to obtain risk of CMV infection during
pregnancy for the entire population (i.e., seronegative and
seropositive) of women. We then multiplied the risk of
infection in the entire population of women by the aver-
age number of live-birth pregnancies per year for the years
1988­1994 [17]. This product represented the estimated
annual number of women with a primary CMV infection
during pregnancy.
Results
The overall force of CMV infection in 12­49 year-olds in
the United States was 1.6 per 100 persons per year (Table
1). The associated basic reproductive rate of 1.7 indicates
that, on average, an infected person transmits CMV to
nearly two susceptible people. The average age of CMV
infection was 28.6 years. Among 12­49 year-olds, CMV
force of infection was significantly higher among non-
Hispanic Blacks (5.7) and Mexican Americans (5.1) than
among non-Hispanic Whites (1.4) (Table 1). These differ-
ences were reflected in the average age (in years) of infec-
tion, which was 16.3 for non-Hispanic Blacks, 17.5 for
Mexican Americans, and 29.3 for non-Hispanic Whites.
Force of infection was significantly higher in the low
household income group (3.5) than in the middle (2.1)
and upper (1.5) household income groups.
We observed considerable variation in force of infection
when we stratified by age and sex (Figures 1 and 2).
Among adolescent girls (ages 12­19 years), non-Hispanic
blacks had a substantially higher force of infection (9.9)
than the other groups. In contrast, among pre-adolescent
girls (ages 6­11 years), Mexican Americans had the high-
est force of infection (11.0). Among adolescent boys (ages
12­19 years), force of infection was highest in non-His-
panic blacks (6.4) and Mexican Americans (8.7).
Among seronegative women ages 20­49 years, risk of pri-
mary CMV infection during a full-term pregnancy was
estimated to be 1.38 percent among non-Hispanic
Whites, 3.40 percent among non-Hispanic Blacks, and
3.85 percent among Mexican Americans (Table 2). How-
ever, among 12­19 year-old seronegative women, risk was
much higher for non-Hispanic blacks (7.33 percent) than
for Mexican Americans (2.21 percent) and for non-His-
panic whites (0.15 percent). The estimated annual
number of women ages 12­49 experiencing primary CMV
infection during pregnancy was approximately 27,000.
Most of these infections occur in non-Hispanic Whites
because they are the largest racial/ethnic group in the U.S.
However, non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans,
especially those under age 30, are disproportionately
likely to have pregnancies in which they experience pri-
mary CMV infections.
Discussion
Robust estimates of the frequency of new CMV infections
are essential for understanding and preventing viral trans-
mission. This study provides the first estimates of CMV
incidence that are based on population-representative
data. We found that among CMV-seronegative individuals
aged 12­49 in the United States, nearly one in 60 serocon-
verts each year.
This relatively low force of infection indicates that CMV is
less easily transmitted than some other infections, such as
measles or rubella. For these infections, high vaccine effi-
cacy and coverage are required in order to interrupt trans-
mission [18]. In contrast, a CMV vaccine would not need
to have such high efficacy and coverage to substantially
prevent CMV transmission. Griffiths et al. [10], who esti-
mated forces of CMV infection of 3.1­3.5/100 persons/
year in the United Kingdom, showed that modest rates of
vaccination (~60 percent) would be able to eradicate CMV
infection from the human population. Our estimates,
which are similar but even lower overall (force of infec-
tion = 1.6/100 persons/year), provide further evidence
that modestly effective vaccines and rates of vaccination
could significantly reduce CMV transmission.
Our models identified large racial/ethnic disparities in the
frequencies of new CMV infections. The force of infection
for CMV was considerably higher in non-Hispanic Blacks
and Mexican Americans than in non-Hispanic Whites.
The nearly three-fold differences in risk of primary CMV
infection among seronegative women could be responsi-
ble for much of the racial/ethnic disparities in rates of
infants born with congenital CMV [19]. Racial/ethnic dif-
ferences were especially pronounced among adolescent
girls (ages 12­19 years), among whom primary infection
was 50 times more likely in seronegative non-Hispanic
blacks and 15 times more likely in seronegative Mexican
Americans than in non-Hispanic whites. These higher
forces of infection (i.e., incidence in seronegative individ-
uals) suggest that CMV is circulating more frequently in
these racial/ethnic groups. Thus, seropositive, pregnant
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans may be at a
higher risk of suffering re-infection with a different strain

of CMV, which also places their infants at risk of sympto-
matic congenital CMV [8]. These disparities indicate that
interventions, such as vaccines or education campaigns,
may need to be tailored to meet the needs of different
racial/ethnic groups and different age groups.
In addition to race/ethnicity, low household income was
a risk factor for CMV infection. People with low house-
hold income may be more likely to have a larger family
and experience crowding, thus facilitating CMV transmis-
sion via close contact. However, because force of infection

Negative values for force of infection can occur because the models treat the CMV seroprevalences as if they come from a sin-
gle cohort followed over time, when in fact they are age-specific seroprevalences of a population at a single point in time. Thus,
in the younger ages where the sample sizes are smaller, it is possible for an older age group to have a somewhat lower sero-
prevalence than a younger age group, which can lead to a negative value for force of infection. We considered force of infec-
tion differences to be statistically significant when corresponding confidence intervals did not overlap.

was more strongly associated with race/ethnicity than
with household income, high-risk racial/ethnic groups
may have a higher prevalence of additional factors related
to CMV transmission, such as increased exposure to CMV
while caring for young children. A more detailed analysis
of risk factors for CMV infection in NHANES III can be
found in Staras et al. [12].
Among women ages 20­49 years, force of infection
appeared to be independent of age, suggesting that risk of
infection during pregnancy is fairly constant during these
ages, and that interventions to prevent congenital CMV
must target all women of childbearing age. CMV had a
higher force of infection than infections transmitted pri-
marily via sex or injection drug use, such as herpes sim-
plex virus type 2 (HSV-2) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). This
suggests either that CMV is more easily transmissible
through such behaviors [20] or, more likely, that CMV is
transmitted via other, additional routes. Given that CMV
has been shown to be transmitted via urine or saliva dur-
ing close, non-sexual contact, it is likely that this sort of
transmission plays a major role in the dynamics of CMV
infection [7].
We estimated that each year in the United States more
than 27,000 pregnant women experience primary CMV
infection and are thus at high risk of giving birth to a child
with congenital CMV infection. This estimate does not
include any fetal losses that may have been caused by pri-
mary CMV infection, nor does it include the many preg-
nancies affected by CMV reactivation or reinfection
among seropositive women. The burden of primary CMV
infections during pregnancy falls disproportionately on
disadvantaged women--those of low income and racial/
ethnic minorities. Furthermore, teenaged minority
women are at especially high risk of primary CMV infec-
tions during pregnancy, due to their high prevalence of
susceptibility, high force of infection, and high pregnancy
rates.
The risk of primary CMV infection during pregnancy
among seronegative women is similar to previous esti-
mates [4]. For seronegative women, CMV infection repre-
sents one of the highest risks for fetal damage that they
experience during pregnancy [21]. Because CMV transmis-
sion is potentially preventable [1], CMV antibody screen-
ing prior to or near the beginning of pregnancy should be
evaluated as a means of identifying women at high risk for
having congenitally infected infants. Studies should pur-
sue whether knowledge of high risk status is a useful moti-
vational tool for modifying behaviors, such as hand
hygiene, for reducing risk of infection [22]. Such screening
may also lead to the administration of CMV hyperim-
muneglobulins or antiviral drugs for prevention or ther-
apy of fetal infection and disease [23,24].
In this study the modeling assumptions appeared to have
been reasonably satisfied. On a population level, CMV
infection does not contribute significantly to mortality
among infected individuals. Nearly all members (=99 per-
cent) of the population are susceptible at birth, and infec-
tion is believed to induce life-long immunity. The type I
death-rate cut-off was chosen as 70 years to approximate
the U.S. life expectancy during the years that NHANES III
was conducted, but modifying the cut-off had little effect
on the model results. The assumption of homogeneous
mixing is unlikely to be completely true, but because CMV
infection is common and has multiple transmission
modes, susceptible individuals are likely to have similar
risks of exposure to CMV.
An important limitation of our models was that the data
were from a single, cross-sectional study so that time
trends were not able to be addressed. Thus, high CMV
seroprevalence in cohorts of older people might not
reflect current incidence and could cause the models to
overestimate the force of infection [12]. We sought to
minimize this potential bias by focusing most of our anal-
yses on a limited age range (12­49 years). It is also impor-
tant to note that our younger, age-specific force of
infection estimates (i.e., for ages 6­11 and 12­19 years)
were imprecise, with wide confidence intervals. Further-
more, the models implicitly assumed that seroprevalence
was monotonically increasing with age, as if this cross-sec-
tional study were a cohort study in which seroprevalence
was measured at various ages of follow-up. However, this
assumption was violated for some of the younger subpop-
ulations. As a result, we occasionally obtained negative
estimates for the force of infection (Figure 2), although
these estimates were not statistically different from zero.
The calculations of risk of primary infection during preg-
nancy required several assumptions, one of which was
that the force of infection was the same for pregnant and
non-pregnant women. Women who are pregnant may
have fewer sex partners (and thus lower risk of exposure to
CMV) during pregnancy; on the other hand, pregnant
women may be more likely than non-pregnant women to
be exposed to young children (a group that frequently
sheds CMV). Pregnant women may also have a higher risk
of acquiring infections because of pregnancy-induced
immune depression [25].
Based on our models, we would estimate that more than
one million United States women have experienced pri-
mary CMV infections during pregnancy since CMV was
first isolated 50 years ago [26,27]. A substantial propor-
tion of these infections would have led to congenital
infections, leaving thousands of children with lifelong
disabilities. Children from disadvantaged racial/ethnic
groups are likely to have been disproportionately

impacted. These many affected children are a compelling
argument for accelerating research on vaccines and other
interventions for the prevention of congenital CMV [28].
Conclusion
Each year, thousands of CMV infections occur in pregnant
women in the United States, putting numerous unborn
babies at risk for serious disabilities. Incidence of CMV
infection in pregnant women is not distributed evenly,
but exhibits sharp racial/ethnic disparities, especially
affecting non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans.
Because of the magnitude of the problem and its associ-
ated health disparities, there is an urgent need to acceler-
ate research on vaccines and other interventions for
preventing congenital CMV disease. Nevertheless, the low
incidence of CMV infection relative to other vaccine-pre-
ventable infections provides encouraging evidence that

*Ages were selected to be roughly comparable with the ages we modeled; in general, young children were not selected for comparison because
they often had much higher forces of infection. Patients were recruited from 2 different hospitals.

Appendix
To estimate CMV incidence by using the force of infection,
we used the catalytic model approach described in Far-
rington [14] and Anderson [13]. We began by assuming
that the force of infection was age-dependent, so that
where a is age and S-(a) is the age distribution for the
seronegatives. To assess the shape of the integral above we
proceeded as Farrington, by visual inspections. (x)was
evaluated as an exponential decay function and as a poly-
nomial of third or lesser degree. Despite permitting (x)
to be a complicated function, force of infection was
approximately constant as a function of age (i.e., force of
infection was age-independent). Therefore, we used the
log-linear approach where the force of infection is the
slope of the regression model (i.e., (x) equals the con-
stant ) given by ln(S-(a)) = -(
0
+ a). This model, used
by Griffiths [10] to estimate CMV force of infection, also
seemed to fit the NHANES III data in most cases, where 
0
plays the role of the natural logarithm of the age-adjusted
seronegative proportion. We made one modification to
this model when we estimated force of infection within
subgroups:  was treated as constant within pieces of the
age range, namely, 6­11 years, 12­19 years, and 20­49
years (Figure 3).
With the age-independent assumption, the average age of
infection, A, and the basic reproductive rate, R0
, were esti-
mated by:
where L = 70 is the threshold age for the type I death rate.
When estimating force of infection for different subgroup
categories, one category was chosen to be the referent cat-
egory and the others were represented by indicator varia-
bles and were included in the models with interaction for
age. For example, in the case of race/ethnicity, which had
3 categories and White as the referent category, the model
was:
ln(S-(a)) = -(
0
+ 
0
a + 
1
[White - Black] + 
2
[Mexican] +

1
[White - Black]a + 
2
[Mexican]a),
where  [X] = 1 if X and 0 otherwise.
The final models were estimated using the STATA 8.0
(College Station, TX) svypoisson command (log-linear
model), which is appropriate for complex survey estima-
tion. The sample weight, cluster, and strata variables sug-
gested by the NHANES III analytical guidelines were used
to adjust the estimates for the sample design. The variance
was estimated by the linearization method [29]. The R0
and A and their confidence intervals were estimated using
the nlcom command for non-linear transformations of
the regression parameters.
