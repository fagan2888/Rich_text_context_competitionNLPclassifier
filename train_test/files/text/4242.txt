Abstract: This paper examines predictions from evolutionary and socio-structural
perspectives on sex differences in mate selection criteria on a sample of 127
respondents from Serbia. The respondents, mainly college students, were asked to
assess the degree of un/desirability of sixty behavioural and personality traits in a
potential mate, on the 7-point Likert type scale. The sexes strongly agree in
general ranking of the traits' desirability. The obtained statistically significant
differences tend to favour the evolutionary interpretation. The largest differences
are in the perceived desirability of thinness, strength, fearfulness, self-pity,
fragility, aggressiveness, and beauty. Males perceived all these traits as more
desirable (or less undesirable) than females, except that females valued strength
more positively. Male respondents are less troubled by negative character traits of
a potential partner, while females are less concerned with a partner's physical
appearance. The higher status of women correlated positively with their concern
with a mate's potential socio-economic status, contrary to the prediction of the
socio-structural model.

Introduction
Research on sexual dimorphism in mate selection criteria has resulted in the
broad generalization that women are more concerned with prospective mate's
Mate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia
potential control over social and economic resources and with (his) readiness to
share them, while men pay relatively more attention to physical attractiveness
(e.g., Buss, 1998, 1989; Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Townsend and Levy, 1990). The
difference is, of course, relative: both women and men are concerned with mate's
attractiveness and resourcefulness, but they differ in relative weight given to these
two groups of characteristics (Buss, 1987). Convergence of the obtained findings
corroborating this simple generalization about sex differences has been followed
by divergent theoretical interpretations. Two general approaches are presently
relevant: the socio-structural and that of evolutionary psychology.
Buss (1987, 1994) developed a number of evolutionary hypotheses concerning
sex differences in mate selection criteria in humans. Since the number of
offspring a Homo sapiens female can produce is limited, evolution would favor
those who are able to secure sufficient resources for upbringing her offspring.
Therefore, part of the female reproductive strategy is to secure mates that are able
and willing to provide necessary resources. Hence, Buss (1987) concludes, female
mate choice criteria should include signs indicating control or potential control
over necessary resources, and related personality traits ­ ambition, dominance,
diligence.
Basic limitation for males' reproductive success is not so much in the access to
resources (since their parental investment is modest), but rather in their access to
reproductively capable females (Buss, 1987). Since female reproductive value is
closely related to age and health, these should be among the most important
criteria males should take into account. Because it is difficult to directly assess
health and age, "male mate preferences and standards of female beauty should
evolve to reflect the physical and behavioral cues that signify female reproductive
capability... Physical appearance probably provides the strongest set of cues, and
these include features such as clear, smooth, and unblemished skin, lustrous hair,
white teeth, clear eyes, and full lips" (Buss, 1987, p. 341; see also Symons, 1979).
The expected sex differences have repeatedly been observed in different studies
and in different cultures (e.g., Buss, 1994, 1989), and using different
methodological approaches (Feingold, 1990).
Socio-structural perspectives view sex differences in mate selection criteria as
the outcome of the interaction of class and gender inequalities, sexual power
relations, and patriarchal ideology (Eagly and Wood, 1999; Jackson, 1992). Eagly
and Wood (1999) attribute the decisive causal influence to the different social
roles men and women are routinely assigned. Since typical male social roles are
accompanied with greater power and prestige, women, lead by the desire to
"maximize their outcomes within the constraints that society establish for people
of their sex" (Eagly and Wood, 1999, p. 414), seek to exchange their appearance
and nurturance for characteristics associated with male roles (see also Hamermesh
and Biddle, 1994). In favor of the socio-structural interpretation, for example,
could be the finding that in recent decades, with increased social and economic
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 117
Mate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia
equality, sexes have become more alike in their mate preferences, although the
convergence seems to be mostly due to men approaching women's standards
(Buss et al., 2001).
Contrary to the socio-structural hypothesis, however, a number of studies have
found that women of higher socio-economic status emphasize the importance of
potential partner's `good financial prospects' even more than women of lower
strata (e.g., Buss and Barnes 1986; Wiederman and Allgeier, 1992; Townsend,
1989; Townsend and Levy, 1990).
The debate between the two theoretical orientations still seems to be
unresolved, as attested by different interpretations of the same cross-cultural data
(Buss, 1989; Eagly and Wood, 1999; Kasser and Sharma, 1999). One of the
possible ways to contribute to the issue is further cross-cultural research.
Countries of the former 'Second World' are especially rarely studied in this
respect, which is unfortunate given the emphasis placed on equality among sexes
in the official ideology of the 'Real Socialism'. In reality, gender equality was
pursued more sincerely with respect to political freedoms and the labor market
than in the private sphere, where communists remained rather conservative. Thus,
it is important to examine whether experience with the specific official ideology
made our Serbian respondents different from those from other cultures.
Since Serbia culturally represents a mixture of patriarchalism and a socialist
modernization project, we expected to replicate findings reported in the literature,
but we also expected a difference of relatively small magnitude. On the basis of
structural powerlessness hypothesis, we predicted that the socioeconomic status of
women should be negatively related to their emphasis on economic resources of a
potential mate.
Certain methodological aspects of the present study should be noted. We opted
for the Likert-type items rather than for ranking in order to allow for the
expression of equal desirability of different traits. We also included a rather
extensive list of traits (60 items) in order to examine whether sex differences exist
in other areas besides preferences for resources and physical attractiveness.
Finally, the respondents were asked for their preferences concerning long-term
potential mates. Hence, the expected sex differences should be more likely to
appear since men tend to relax their requirements in the context of short-term
mating (e.g., Buss, 1994; for women's perspective on short-term mating see
Greilig and Buss, 2000).
Method
Survey and respondents
The survey was conducted in the spring of 1997, as a part of an extracurricular
course in Social Psychology, at the Open University, Subotica, Serbia. Some of
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 118
Mate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia
the respondents were the attendants of the course, who themselves collected the
rest of data by administering the questionnaire to their peers, family members and
acquaintances. The sample is not a random one, but it is comparable to the
samples from other related studies. Moreover, it is more diverse than typical
psychology student samples. There were 127 respondents in total, of which 74 are
females. The average age of the respondents is 18.5 years; the range from 15 to
42, and the majority of adolescent age: 81% being between 17 and 19 years old.
Instrument
We applied the frequently-used technique of a closed-ended list of un/desirable
traits in potential mates (e.g., Buss, 1989, Townsend, 1989; Wiederman and
Allgeier, 1992). The respondents were asked to asses the degree of un/desirability
of each of the 60 traits and characteristics (see Table 1) of a potential mate, on the
7-point Likert type scale (from 1 ­ completely undesirable, unimportant, to 7 ­
most important, most desirable). The questionnaire also asked for basic socio-
demographic indicators, such as age, sex, and education. Youngsters were asked
for their parents' education, while in case of adult respondents we used their own
educational level.
Results
Average estimates of trait desirability for the entire sample, and females and
males separately, are given in Table 1. Looking at the results for the total sample,
we can observe that among the traits assessed as the most desirable are sincerity,
faithfulness, tenderness, passion, reliability, maturity, and intelligence. Traits
assessed as moderately desirable or important are, for example, courage,
elegance, attractiveness, thinness, talent for sports, strength, thriftiness,
dominance. The least desirable, or the most undesirable are traits such as
conceitedness, selfishness, insecurity, aggressiveness, fearfulness, introversion.
There is a strong agreement between the sexes about this general ordering of
the traits, but there are some statistically significant differences. The largest
differences (p's<.01) are in the desirability of aggressiveness, thinness, strength,
self-pity, fearfulness, fragility, and beauty. Males perceived all these traits as more
desirable (or less undesirable) than females, except for the strength which is more
valued by women.
There are six additional items with somewhat smaller but still statistically
significant differences (p <.05). Two items refer to appearance - good looks and
attractiveness, and four items refer to personality traits: seriousness,
independence, enterprising, sincerity. Men scored higher on the former items,
while the character traits were perceived as more desirable by women .

Correlation coefficients between the estimated trait desirability and socio-
economic status, as indicated by the educational level of a respondent's parent
with the higher degree of education, are shown in Table 2. In the total sample,
SES correlates with the perceived desirability of a mate's erudition (r=.20,

p<.05), talkativeness (r=.19, p<.05), and interesting profession (r=.25, p<.01).
However, the results for the total sample hide the fact that none of the coefficients
is significant in both subsamples.

Among women, SES is in positive correlation with the estimated desirability of
a mate's erudition (r=.36, p<.01), passion (r=.33, p<.01), interesting profession
(r=.33, p<.01), and talkativeness (r=.27, p<.05). Among men, SES correlates
(negatively) only with the importance attached to the taste for clothes (r=-.30,
p<.05). Thus, higher status women desire better educated, more passionate
partners, who have interesting profession and are more talkative. Lower status
men desire, relatively more, partners who show better taste for clothes.
Discussion
Of the 60 examined traits, statistically significant differences were obtained on
13 characteristics. The size of even the largest differences (e.g., thinness,
aggressiveness) is relatively small in terms of the raw scores (somewhat above
one raw score point). Just as in many other studies (e.g., Buss, 1987; Goodwin,
1990), we observed that sex differences in mate selection criteria are small.
Both sexes perceive traits such as faithfulness, sincerity, tenderness, reliability,
passion, carefulness, as highly desirable. Traits with the opposite implications are
assessed as the most undesirable (e.g., conceitedness, selfishness, insecurity,
aggressiveness, shyness). These highly desirable and undesirable traits seem to be
important for interpersonal functioning, and are often regarded as consequential
for mate retention, rather than mate selection (cf. Buss, 1994).
Many of the characteristics particularly relevant for the present research
problem are assessed as moderately desirable, or even neutral. In accordance with
other reported results (Buss, 1989; Buss et al., 2001), traits pertaining to physical
appearance are assessed as moderately desirable by both sexes. There is not a
single trait referring to physical appearance in the upper third of the list - the
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 122
Mate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia
highest graded is physical attractiveness, and it is 22nd on the list.
One category of traits that does differentiate sexes indicates negative
personality characteristics, including fearfulness, self-pity, and aggressiveness.
Although both sexes evaluate these traits negatively, men are more ready to
tolerate them in potential mates. From the point of view of evolutionary theory,
the more negative attitude of females towards fearfulness, fragility, and self-pity,
might speak of their anticipation of the failure of such person in social
competition. At the same time, this can be explained from the perspective of the
gender roles - these traits contradict traditionally defined masculinity.
Seriousness, independence, and being enterprising are traits assessed
significantly more positively by women. From an evolutionary perspective traits
like these are indirectly related to a mate's potential capability to secure resources
and succeed in social competition. However, this provides rather modest support
for the hypothesis about `female choice'. Many of the traits more directly related
to resource acquisition are equally desired by both sexes (e.g., intelligence,
ability, diligence, capability to earn, erudition, ambition, to have money, or to
have a car), thus confirming that "desire for status is fundamental dimension of
mate preferences for both men and women" (Pratto, Sidanius and Stallworth,
1993).
Thinness, attractiveness, good looks, and beauty form another category of traits
that significantly differentiate sexes. All these traits are indicators of physical
appearance, and are significantly more positively valued by men. This result
confirms sex-linked character of the importance of a mate's look in the long-term
mating (e.g., Buss, 1994). It is interesting that a significant difference did not
appear on the item physical attractiveness - the item that significantly
differentiated sexes in 37 cultures (Buss, 1989).
Women's more positive assessment of a mate's strength has somewhat
ambiguous meaning. Besides the `bodyguard hypothesis' (Mesnick, 1997),
strength can be interpreted as a character trait, potentially useful in social
competition. On the other hand, strength could imply physical attractiveness from
the female point of view. Pratto et al. (1993) found that items such as dominant
and tall loaded on factor "sexy" that contained attractiveness and sexuality items
among women. Similar reasoning could be applied to women's lower valuation of
being thin, thus challenging the evolutionary psychologists' claim that females
place less emphasis on the partner's physical appearance. Perhaps, male physical
attractiveness is expressed in terms other than 'physical attractiveness'.
Finally, the higher desirability of sincerity expressed by women, together with
their already discussed more positive assessment of various personality traits
speaks not only about the care to choose a reliable partner, but also about the
attention devoted to the quality of interpersonal relationship and a mate's
personality characteristics. Similar results are reported by, for example, Smith et
al. (1990), Botwin et al. (1997), Shaffer and Bazzini (1997), and Pratto et al.

Mate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia
(1993).
In order to examine the hypothesis about the functionality of mate selection
criteria from the perspective of the subordinate position of women in socio-
economic structure, we examined whether sex differences existed in the
relatedness of SES and perceived trait desirability. SES generally does not
correlate with perceived trait desirability. In the female sample, relatively low
significant positive correlations are obtained between the SES and desirability of
a mate's erudition, passion, interesting profession, and talkativeness. To the
extent that education and interesting profession indicate higher (potential) status,
this finding goes against socio-structural theories (cf. Wiederman and Allgeier,
1992). Women of higher socio-economic status could `afford' relationships with
lower status males since they themselves could provide resources, yet they instead
increase their requirements. While cross-cultural research show that sex
differences in the emphasis on resource-acquisition characteristics diminish in
gender-egalitarian societies (Kasser and Sharma, 1999), our findings reinforce the
generalization that intra-culturally women's preferences for high status mates
increase with their SES.
From the perspective of the theories examined it is not clear why women's
perception of desirability of passion and talkativeness increases with SES. It is
possible that higher-status females tend to become more demanding in general, as
if their higher status is treated as an additional asset in the mate selection strategy
allowing women to increase their demands. Negative correlation of SES and taste
in clothing on the sample of males (the only significant coefficient) is also of
unclear theoretical relevance. It is possible that a clothes, as a status symbol, is
more relevant for respondents of lower social status.
Conclusions
The hypothesis formulated on the basis of the evolutionary psychology
perspective received qualified support: results indicate that males tend to attach
relatively greater weight to physical attractiveness of potential mates.
Nevertheless, sex differences in the evaluation of strength and thinness could be
interpreted as referring to male physical attractiveness, and therefore as evidence
of women's specific emphasis on mate's physical attractiveness.
Women did not perceive traits directly referring to a mate's material wealth as
more desirable than men (traits such as capability to earn, success in job, or to
have money). The differences are obtained concerning the traits more indirectly
related to material propsects of a potential mate, and to his readiness to share
resources as well. These traits are seriousness, independence, being enterprising,
and sincerity.
The hypothesis derived from (one possible interpretation of) socio-structural
theories, stating that with higher socio-economic status women should attach less

Mate selection criteria: A trait desirability assessment study of sex differences in Serbia
importance to a mate's material perspective, is not supported. Moreover, the
results contradict this hypothesis since higher SES is related with higher
evaluation of a partner's erudition among women.
In general the results clearly suggest the essential similarity of men and
women. Their congruence in the assigned desirability of the given traits is
remarkable. Both sexes seem to strive for maximization along dimensions of
attractiveness, status, and personality traits (Shaffer and Bazzini, 1997). Our
respondents seem to be concerned first with finding a partner with whom they
could develop and maintain a satisfying interpersonal relationship, and then with
her or his appearance and economic status.
