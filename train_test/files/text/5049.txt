Abstract
This study provides an overview of homicide clearance in four West European countries: Finland,
the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Using data from the European Homicide Monitor,
employing similar definitions and uniform coding schemes, this study allowed for unique cross-
country comparisons in factors influencing differences in homicide clearance rates. Findings
based on homicides occurring in the period 2009­14 revealed overall low homicide rates in
all countries, with a wide variety in homicide clearance rates, ranging from 77 percent in the
Netherlands to 98 percent in Finland. Results further showed that both event-based as well
as victim-based characteristics significantly influenced the likelihood of homicide clearance,
suggesting that homicide clearance rates can, for a large part, be attributed to the prevalent types
of homicide in each of these European countries.

Homicide clearance
Homicide is a rare, but serious form of interpersonal violence, leading to shock and
incomprehension in society at large. The societal impact of homicide is exacerbated
when cases take a particularly long time to solve or even remain completely unsolved,
usually referred to as `uncleared'. An uncleared homicide typically means police have
not identified a suspect or do not have enough evidence for arrest. More generally, police
are simply missing essential information about the suspect(s), including the victim­
offender relationship, particularly when, for a period of time, the identity of the victim
remains unknown (Quinet and Nunn, 2014).
Outside Europe, homicide clearance rates currently range from 96 percent in South
Korea (Johnson, 2008), 95 percent in Japan (Roberts, 2008), to 24 percent in Trinidad
and Tobago (Maguire et al., 2010). In non-European Western countries, homicide clear-
ance rates vary from 91 percent in New Zealand (New Zealand Crime Statistics, 2015),
87 percent in Australia (Chan and Payne, 2013), to 75 percent in Canada (Mahony and
Turner, 2012) and 65 percent in the United States (Roberts, 2008). Prior research in
European countries has revealed 98 percent of homicides being solved in Finland (Lehti
and Kivivuori, 2012), between 88 and 94 percent in Germany (Polizeiliche
Kriminalstatistik, 2014), 87 percent in Switzerland (Bänziger and Killias, 2014), 85 per-
cent in England & Wales (Smith et al., 2012), and about 80 percent in Sweden (Granath,
2011) and in the Netherlands (Van Os et al., 2010).
One may question, however, the validity of these figures when making interna-
tional comparisons. Linking international homicide clearance rates is hindered by the
differential use of definitions. Further, some reports exclude homicides committed in
conjunction with a felony or other crime. In these statistics, homicides are coded as a
by-product of another felony ­ for example, a homicide committed in the course of a
robbery is coded as a `robbery gone wrong' rather than a homicide (Finch, 2001).
Much of the homicide clearance literature to date relies on data from the United States
(Alderden and Lavery, 2007; Davis et al., 2014; Doerner and Doerner, 2012; Jarvis
and Regoeczi, 2009; Keel et al., 2009; Litwin and Xu, 2007; Quinet and Nunn, 2014;
Regoeczi et al., 2008; Riedel and Boulahanis, 2007; Roberts, 2007; Roberts and
Lyons, 2009, 2011; Schroeder and White, 2009; Taylor et al., 2009). So far, it has not
been possible to compare homicide clearance rates between European countries,
owing to differences in definitions, data sources and criminal justice procedures. To
overcome these limitations, for the purpose of this study we will make use of the
European Homicide Monitor, a unified data system including information on homi-
cide cases, offenders and victims in four European countries: Finland, the Netherlands,
Sweden and Switzerland.
The need to shed light on internationally comparable homicide clearance rates in
Europe is at least threefold. First, homicide is the most violent form of crime. The impact
and consequences of homicide are severe for the relatives, friends and acquaintances
involved. Unsolved homicides cause considerable psychological and emotional damage
for the bereaved. The uncertainty and the apparent lack of a motive for their deaths
inhibit adequate mourning (Poijula, 2010; Wijk et al., 2013). Unsolved homicides are
accompanied by feelings of insecurity, turmoil and injustice.
Liem et al. 3
Second, unsolved homicides ­ owing to the long duration of investigations, whether
or not followed by costly cold case investigations ­ are associated with high financial
costs, without leading to a positive outcome. Poor clearance rates may not only reduce
morale among police officers but also lead to diminished public trust in the criminal
justice system, including the police (Riedel, 1999).
Additionally, certain homicides ­ particularly homicides taking place in a criminal
setting ­ that remain uncleared may constitute a risk of initiating new homicides as
revenge. Such chain-reactions and connections between certain homicides have been
reported in prior studies (Granath, 2011). It is therefore fundamental to gain insight into
what factors determine homicide clearance and, in turn, provide the basis for strategies
necessary to increase the homicide clearance rate.
Theoretical background
Examining the reasons for homicide clearance has potential policy relevance for improv-
ing low clearance rates, and may provide a window into police allocation of investigative
effort (Roberts and Lyons, 2009). Several theoretical frames have previously been used
in relation to homicide clearance rates. Roughly, these theories can be divided in two
groups: Black's theory on discretional factors (Black, 1970) and Gottfredson and
Hindelang's theory on non-discretional factors (Gottfredson and Hindelang, 1979).
Whereas the first theoretical perspective holds that the police and political forces play a
decisive role in the (un)cleared status of a crime, the second perspective suggests that
case-specific factors affect the homicide clearance rate. Put simply, is homicide clear-
ance a function of extra-legal factors, such as the likeability of victims and offenders, or
is clearance a product of the availability of investigative evidence leading to an arrest?
Discretional factors
Black's Theory of Law (1970) suggests that police use discretion in clearing homicide
cases: they base their choices on the social characteristics of the victims and the areas in
which the homicide took place (Black, 1970, 1976; Litwin, 2004). From a victim-deval-
uation standpoint, cases with specific victim characteristics receive more `law', and
hence are more likely to be solved, compared with other cases. For example, cases that
involve female victims, white victims and younger victims are thought to be more likely
to be cleared compared with cases that involve `less likeable' victims, such as victims
with a prior arrest record (Regoeczi et al., 2008; Roberts, 2007; Roberts and Lyons,
2009, 2011; Sturup et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2009). Similarly, Black (1980) hypothe-
sized that crimes are less likely to be solved when they occur in areas with lower social-
economic status, lower educational attainment levels, higher unemployment rates and a
smaller percentage of owner-occupied dwelling units (Litwin and Xu, 2007). What fol-
lows is that those homicides will get less police attention and therefore are less often
solved (Lyons and Roberts, 2014). Later theorists have added that solving crimes, includ-
ing homicides, is a political process (Davis et al., 2014). From this perspective, the strat-
egy and amount of law available are not determined by the individual police detective
but are orchestrated at higher organizational levels. Here, the quantity of law given to
4 European Journal of Criminology 00(0)
each homicide case is affected by the culture and organization of the police force. In the
same line of reasoning, heavy crime workloads are thought to be associated with lower
clearance rates (Paré et al., 2007), suggesting that a high homicide rate goes hand in hand
with low clearance rates, although empirical findings assessing this premise are mixed
(Litwin, 2004; Litwin and Xu, 2007).
Non-discretional factors
Rather than considering discretionary factors or political forces as an explanation for the
processes that lead to an (un)successful clearance, Gottfredson and Hindelang (1979)
suggest that non-discretional factors, or factors outside police control, predominantly
determine the odds of clearance. From this point of view, because homicide is such a
unique crime, there is a strong organizational pressure on police always to be equally
attentive to solving the case, irrespective of who the victim is or where the crime occurs
(Litwin, 2004). From this perspective, only non-discretionary factors constitute essential
predictors for clearance status, such as weapon type, location of the victim's body, area
population, the relationship between victim and offender, homicide circumstances and
simultaneously committed offences (Litwin and Xu, 2007; Lyons and Roberts, 2014).
Each of these factors, Hindelang and colleagues (1979) argue, influence the value and
amount of information available to the police, which in turn influences the clearance rate.
Homicide clearance, according to this perspective, is thus primarily a function of whether
investigators have enough evidence to make an arrest and not a choice of how vigorously
to investigate (Roberts and Lyons, 2009).
Previous findings
So far, research has not provided strong support for Black's police discretion perspective.
It should be noted, however, that Black's theories have mostly been tested in democratic
societies where the police force is under the more or less strict control of civil society.
Research in other types of societies is scarce at best. Keeping this caveat in mind, some
studies find that homicide clearance is equally likely for male and female victims
(Addington, 2006; Litwin, 2004), whereas other studies suggest that cases with female
victims are more likely to be solved (Lee, 2005; Regoeczi et al., 2000). In terms of age,
the literature consistently points out that homicides of children have a high likelihood of
being solved, owing to the frequent presence of family members in their company
(Regoeczi et al., 2008). Homicides with elderly victims, however, have a lower clearance
rate, which is probably because elderly people are more subject to robberies by unknown
offenders (Bänziger and Killias, 2014; Litwin, 2004; Regoeczi et al., 2000). Other soci-
odemographic characteristics, such as marital status, also seem to influence the likeli-
hood of clearance, as previous studies found cases involving divorced or single victims
to be among the lowest clearance categories (Riedel, 1999; Silverman and Kennedy,
1987). In terms of ethnic background, some studies find cases with ethnic minority vic-
tims more likely to be cleared than those with ethnic majority victims (Regoeczi et al.,
2000), whereas other studies identified cases with ethnic minority victims less likely to
be cleared (Litwin, 2004; Roberts and Lyons, 2011). Further, the relationship between
Liem et al. 5
economically disadvantaged areas and clearance rate also seems to be mixed. Because
the solvability of cases occurring in community areas with greater economic disadvan-
tage seems to be sensitive to temporal context (Litwin and Xu, 2007), so far there is no
straightforward support for Black's (1970) discretional factors.
There is some evidence that non-discretional (situational) characteristics may influ-
ence the likelihood of homicide clearance, with the availability of physical evidence and
information being more decisive factors (Roberts, 2007). Homicides that include victims
who were found in public spaces, for example, seem to have a higher clearance rate
compared with homicides with victims who were hidden from the public eye, such as
homicides that lacked eyewitnesses (Sturup et al., 2015) or homicides that have taken
place in alleys (Litwin and Xu, 2007; Lyons and Roberts, 2014). In addition, cases with
victims found in private locations (such as homes or apartments) are the most likely to be
cleared (Addington, 2006; Litwin and Xu, 2007; Mouzos and Muller, 2001; Wellford
et al., 1999), since in those cases the perpetrator is almost always the (estranged) intimate
partner or another family member (Litwin and Xu, 2007). Further, in terms of area popu-
lation, findings are mixed. Some studies find homicides in populated areas to be more
likely to be cleared than those in less populated areas, which can be attributed to the
willingness of witnesses in densely populated areas to share information (Wellford et al.,
1999). Others, conversely, find homicides occurring in a small town or sparsely popu-
lated area more likely to be cleared (Litwin, 2004). Also, US studies find that homicides
committed with a firearm are less likely to be cleared compared with cases involving
other types of weapons (Litwin and Xu, 2007; Sturup et al., 2015), related to less forensic
evidence being left at the scene and the accompanying greater physical distance between
victim and perpetrator (Geberth, 1996; see Roberts, 2007). Findings on the influence of
alcohol intoxication are mixed: whereas some studies find alcohol intoxication to be
associated with lower clearance rates (Regoeczi et al., 2008), others report that cases are
more likely to be solved if the victim is intoxicated with alcohol (Granath, 2011; Sturup
et al., 2015). Finally, research shows that homicides are less likely to be cleared when
there is a concomitant felony, or when the homicide is drug-related or gang-related, com-
pared with homicides where a general altercation constitutes the main motive (Litwin
and Xu, 2007; Regoeczi et al., 2000). This can be attributed to the fact that such homi-
cides tend to be committed in areas with a lower likelihood of willing witnesses. Also, as
Roberts (2007) pointed out, these homicides tend to have a random `hit and run' nature
and are therefore harder to investigate effectively. In addition, such drug and felony
homicides typically involve strangers, which may further complicate the investigation
because it is harder to identify a suspect (Jarvis and Regoeczi, 2009; Roberts, 2007).
Again, the vast majority of these prior studies have been conducted in the United States.
So far, it is not known to what extent these findings are also applicable to homicide clear-
ance in Western Europe.
Aim
The aim of this study is at least twofold. First, by making use of a unique, homogeneous
monitoring system, we seek to provide a very first overview of differences in homicide
clearance in four West European countries: Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and
6 European Journal of Criminology 00(0)
Switzerland. Second, we aim to assess which factors influence differences in homicide
clearance both within and between these European countries. Studying homicide clear-
ance allows us to better understand the factors that influence clearance and helps provide
insight into how clearance rates might be improved (Roberts, 2007).
Methodology
The European Homicide Monitor
Cause of death statistics, police statistics and other types of homicide data can be used to
assess the frequency of homicides in different countries, but their comparability is not
without problems owing ­ among other factors ­ to differential inclusion criteria. Further,
whereas some datasets include only victim-based information, other data sources are
mostly perpetrator-based, hampering the matching and comparability of figures derived
from these datasets. Detailed national data on the characteristics of homicides are even
less comparable owing to legal and definitional differences. To overcome these limita-
tions, we have constructed a joint homicide database entitled the European Homicide
Monitor (EHM), enabling comparisons and analyses among European countries (for a
detailed overview, see Granath et al., 2011; Liem et al., 2013).
The EHM consists of 85 variables and includes victim, offender and incident charac-
teristics. There are differences in the degree to which countries possess detailed informa-
tion on each homicide. In the EHM, homicide is defined as an intentional criminal act of
violence by one or more human beings resulting in the death of one or more other human
beings. This definition covers similar legal codes for homicide in each of the four coun-
tries studied and roughly covers the definition used in other multisite datasets such as the
National Violent Death Reporting System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2016). In Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden, the definition covers the legal codes of
murder, manslaughter, infanticide and assault leading to death. Attempted homicides,
suicides, abortion, euthanasia and assistance with suicide are not included in the data.
Neither are cases of involuntary manslaughter by, for example, drunk driving, nor cases
of intentional but (by court decision) legally justified killings ­ for example, police offic-
ers shooting an individual in self-defence. Switzerland uses a slightly different defini-
tion, which leads to the exclusion of assaults leading to death and the inclusion of killings
from legitimate self-defence.1 For this study, we will apply the EHM framework to pro-
vide an overview of all homicides that took place in the Netherlands, Sweden and
Switzerland in the period 2009­14 and in Finland in the period 2003­14 and had become
known to the authorities by 31 December 2015.
Homicide data sources
Finnish homicide data in the period 2003­14 have been maintained by the Institute of
Criminology and Legal Policy at the University of Helsinki (ICLP) and have been added
into the Finnish Homicide Monitor (FHM). The FHM is based on information produced
during preliminary police investigations, and collected directly by the chief investigator
on a compulsory standard electronic form. For crimes that are not cleared within
Liem et al. 7
a reasonable amount of time, the available data are registered about one year after the
initiation of the investigation, provided that the case is still being investigated as a prob-
able homicide. The FHM contains a great number of detailed variables related to victim,
offender and case characteristics, including external data on prior criminal court convic-
tions of perpetrators and victims, and on court rulings. Owing to the extremely small
number of unsolved cases in Finland during the period studied (nine cases), the outcome
variable was differentially defined in Finland. Cases whose clearance took less than 30
days constituted the outcome. These formed 93 percent of all homicides during the
period in the country. Additionally, the observation period was extended to cover the
years from 2003 to 2014.
Homicide data from the Netherlands for the period 2009­14 stem from three sources:
media reports, police data and court files. Media reports on homicides are retrieved from
the Dutch Associated Press and LexisNexis. These reports are completed and verified
with digitalized national police data on homicide events. Third, homicide data are com-
pleted and verified by assessing hard-copy court files, which include the criminal pro-
ceedings of the case, interview excerpts with suspects, relatives and witnesses and, in
several cases, forensic mental health reports.
Homicide data from Sweden for the years 2009­13 are collated by the Swedish
National Council for Crime Prevention. The data include all cases known to the author-
ities as committed in 2009­13, with the clearance status (solved or as yet unsolved)
registered in over 99 percent of all cases. All assessments of cases are based on police
files, the verdicts from the court (if a trial has been carried out) and records of a foren-
sic psychiatric examination when such an examination had been carried out. In short,
the data contain a large number of variables with individual-level information on case,
victim and offender factors, providing possibilities for disaggregated analyses of clear-
ance trends. For detailed case, victim and offender analyses, data were available for the
period 2009­13.
Homicide data from Switzerland stem from the Swiss Homicide Project, which con-
tains a database covering all intentional, completed homicides in Switzerland in the time
period 2005­14. This project is conducted by the University of St. Gallen and financed
by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Homicide cases are identified by the cantonal
departments of public prosecution, which additionally provided information about
exceptionally cleared cases. Data on homicides with perpetrators undergoing a court
procedure stem from court files. For detailed case, victim and offender analyses, homi-
cide data were available for the years 2009­14.
Definitions of variables
EHM homicide incident characteristics include the homicide location, which is regarded
as public when the event took place in a location such as a park, forest, recreational area,
shop, restaurant, bar, street, public transportation or the workplace. A private location
includes the home of the victim or offender, a hotel, motel, dormitory or car. The modus
operandi was determined by the cause of death of the victim based on external causes of
morbidity,accordingtotheWorldHealthOrganizationICD10(InternationalClassification
of Disease) list of `Assaults'. In applying this system, the EHM employs the same
8 European Journal of Criminology 00(0)
definition as the International Classification of Crimes for Statistical Purposes of the
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Here, causes of death include firearms, blunt
instruments, sharp instruments, strangulation, hitting/kicking or other modus operandi,
such as dying of poisoning, explosives, drowning, fire or motor-vehicle-related injuries.
Homicide types include domestic homicides (partner, child and other family killing),
criminal milieu homicides (rip deals, narcotics affairs and homicides taking place between
perpetrator and victim who are both involved in criminal activities, the homicide having
to do with such activities), robbery killings (commercial businesses, private homicides
and street robberies), homicides in nightlife violence, sexual homicides and other homi-
cides. It should be noted that, because these homicide types are partially based on a known
victim­offender relationship, this variable is often missing in uncleared cases. For this
project, we use the following homicide victim and offender characteristics: gender, age
and ethnicity. Whereas in US literature, race (White, Black, Latino) (Litwin, 2004;
Regoeczi et al., 2000; Roberts and Lyons, 2011) has been used to denote majority and
minority groups, we distinguish between ethnic majority ((parents or individual) same
country of birth) and ethnic minority groups ((parents or individual) other country of
birth). In other words, individuals born in the same country where the homicide took
place, but with parents born in another country, are classed as ethnic minority.
In the EHM, a homicide is deemed to be solved if the police considered the case
cleared with the arrest of a suspect or considered it as exceptionally cleared. Exceptionally
cleared cases involve a suspect or perpetrator who is known to the police but for some
reason cannot be (lawfully) arrested. Examples include charges being rejected by the
prosecutor, perpetrators who committed suicide or perpetrators who left the country and
therefore the jurisdiction area (Riedel and Boulahanis, 2007). Exceptional clearances are
also sometimes referred to as `administrative closures' (Maguire et al., 2010).
Analyses
In order to determine differences between cleared and uncleared cases, ANOVA and chi-
squared tests were used. To estimate the probability of a homicide being solved or
remaining unsolved, or, in Finland, being solved in less than 30 days or not being solved
in this time frame, and to further assess the marginal effect of both discretional and non-
discretional variables, multivariate analyses were conducted. Since our main outcome
was dichotomous (a homicide being solved or not; in Finland, solved in less than 30 days
or in 30 days or more), we employed binomial logistic regression, using the enter method
and reporting the odds ratio (OR). Analyses used SPSS version 23.
Results
Descriptive analyses
In the period 2009­14, a total of 617 homicides took place in Finland, 896 in the
Netherlands, 490 in Sweden and 225 in Switzerland. Table 1 reflects the victimization
rates for each of these countries in the time period studied. Throughout the study period,
the homicide rate in three West European countries declined, from 2.24 to 1.63 per
Liem et al. 9
100,000 in Finland, from 1.08 to 0.81 in the Netherlands, and from 0.96 to 0.88 in
Sweden. In Switzerland, in this period the homicide rate fluctuated around 0.50 per
100,000. In the period under study, on average 98 percent of homicides were cleared in
Finland, 77 percent in the Netherlands, 83 percent in Sweden and 95 percent in
Switzerland. The median number of days for cases to be solved was one day in Finland,
one day in the Netherlands, one day in Sweden and zero days (the same day the homicide
took place) in Switzerland.
Considering homicide event characteristics, results showed that in Finland, the
Netherlands and Sweden, homicides taking place in a public setting were significantly
more difficult to clear compared with homicides taking place in a private setting (see
Table 2). In Finland, 88 percent of `public' homicides were cleared in less than 30 days
versus 95 percent of `private'homicides, in the Netherlands the clearance rate of `public'
homicides was 68 percent versus 81 percent of `private' homicides, and in Sweden 73
percent versus 89 percent of homicides occurring indoors. In Switzerland, because of the
very small proportion of unsolved cases, the difference in clearance rate between private
and public homicides remained non-significant. In terms of geographical location, in
most countries no significant differences in clearance were found in homicides occurring
in urban versus in rural areas. The Netherlands constituted an exception, with a signifi-
cantly higher likelihood of homicide clearance in rural areas (79 percent) versus urban
areas (73 percent). Further, although in all countries but Sweden, the percentage of sin-
gle-victim homicides being solved seemed to be somewhat lower than the percentage of
multiple-victim homicides being solved, this finding remained non-significant in all of
the countries. Regarding the modus operandi, results indicated various patterns: First,
there were significant differences in the clearance speed among Finnish homicides in
terms of the method used in the homicide. A closer look at the results showed that homi-
cides committed by `other' methods, such as drowning, smoke, fire, explosives or by
motor vehicle, were harder to clear (81 percent) as compared with other categories,
including homicides committed by firearms (95 percent). Second, results indicated quite

the opposite in both the Netherlands and Sweden, where homicides committed by fire-
arm had overall much lower clearance rates (56 percent in the Netherlands and 57 per-
cent in Sweden) compared with homicides committed by other means. In Switzerland,
with an overall high clearance rate, the modus operandi did not influence the clearance
rate, insofar as all homicides committed with a blunt instrument, by hitting or kicking, or
by other methods were solved (100 percent). What all four countries had in common was
a relatively high clearance rate (in Finland, fast clearance speed) among homicides com-
mitted by blunt or sharp instruments and by so-called `hands-on' methods, such as stran-
gulation and hitting or kicking, with overall percentages ranging from 85 percent to 100
percent. Although there were no significant differences in terms of the type of homicide
in both Finland and Switzerland, in the Netherlands and Sweden the type of homicide did
influence the likelihood of clearance. In both countries, homicides committed in a crimi-
nal milieu (46 percent in the Netherlands and 48 percent in Sweden) and homicides in the
context of a robbery (75 percent in the Netherlands and 73 percent in Sweden) had over-
all much lower clearance rates compared with other types of homicide, such as domestic
homicides, nightlife homicides or sexual homicides.
In terms of victim characteristics (Table 3), in neither Finland nor Switzerland did
gender seem to be associated with differences in homicide clearance, as both male (93
percent in Finland and 95 percent in Switzerland) and female homicides (93 percent in
Finland and 95 percent in Switzerland) were cleared by a similar rate. In the Netherlands
and Sweden, in contrast, homicides involving a female victim had significantly higher
clearance rates (90 percent in the Netherlands and 96 percent in Sweden) compared with
homicides involving a male victim (71 percent in the Netherlands and 76 percent in
Sweden). Significant differences between cleared and uncleared cases in terms of victim
age were found in all countries except Switzerland. Whereas in Finland the cases hardest
to clear were those with young victims under the age of 6 (81 percent) and with old vic-
tims over 65 (88 percent), different patterns were observed in the Netherlands and
Sweden. Here, the lowest clearance rates were found among victims aged between 25
and 39 (71 percent in the Netherlands and 69 percent in Sweden). Finally, bivariate
analyses for Finland, the Netherlands and Switzerland revealed no significant differ-
ences in homicide clearance rates between events involving an ethnic minority victim
compared with cases involving an ethnic majority victim. In Sweden, these groups dif-
fered significantly, with cases involving an ethnic minority victim having a lower clear-
ance rate (65 percent) compared with cases with an ethnic majority victim (91 percent).
Multivariate analyses
In line with the results from the binary analysis, multivariate analyses (see Table 4a)
showed that the likelihood of fast homicide clearance in Finland decreased significantly
when young victims (OR = 0.306) or elderly victims (OR = 0.427) were involved. The
analysis further showed that homicides occurring in a public location decreased the odds
of being solved quickly (OR = 0.346).
In the Netherlands, homicides involving a female victim were on average twice
as likely to be cleared compared with homicides involving a male victim (OR =
2.431) (see Table 4b). Further, whereas not significant in bivariate analyses,

homicides involving an ethnic majority victim were found to be slightly more likely
to be cleared (OR = 1.079) compared with homicides involving an ethnic minority
victim. Finally, homicides committed by a firearm decreased the likelihood of being
cleared significantly (OR = 0.149) compared with homicides committed by other
methods.
The likelihood of homicide clearance in the Netherlands showed many similarities
with homicide clearance in Sweden (see Table 4c), with female victims significantly
increasing the likelihood of a case being solved more than eight times (OR = 8.142), and
ethnic majority victims increasing the likelihood of clearance more than four times (OR
= 4.440). The use of firearms in a homicide, however, significantly decreased the likeli-
hood of homicides being solved (OR = 0.171).

Owing to the very high clearance rate in Switzerland across all categories (Table 4d),
similar to the bivariate analyses, no significant differences were found between cleared
and uncleared cases in terms of victim or event characteristics.
Discussion and conclusion
Findings
This is the first study assessing the differences in homicide clearance in a multitude of
European countries using the same inclusion criteria, coding and data analyses, allowing
for detailed comparisons between these countries. Overall, findings showed that the
clearance rate in Finland and Switzerland in the years of analysis was very high, in some

years of the analysis even reaching 100 percent. Internationally, these rates are extraor-
dinary high, even in comparison with other European countries such as Italy (67 percent
and, later, 78 percent) (Preti and Macciò, 2012), Estonia (80 percent) (Salla et al., 2012),
England & Wales (85 percent) (Smith et al., 2012) and France (80 percent) (Mucchielli,
2012). Because of the very high clearance rate in these countries, few differences were
found in homicide clearance in both bivariate and multivariate comparisons.
Results showed that the country homicide rate does not seem to have a straightfor-
ward relationship with the clearance rate in any of the years under analysis, Finland is a
case in point. With its relatively high homicide rate in the European context, Finnish
homicide clearance rates are among the highest. The lack of such a relationship rejects to
some extent the assumption that a greater homicide caseload limits police resources and
makes cases inherently more difficult to clear (Paré et al., 2007). This also raises ques-
tions, as Litwin and Xu (2007) point out, about whether country homicide rates are a
valid measure of police workload. One should, however, note that, although the Finnish
homicide rates are high in Europe, in the global context they are among the lowest; thus
even Finland is not a very good case to test the workload hypothesis.
From Black's (1970) theoretical perspective, it would further be expected that discre-
tional factors, such as the `likeability' of the victim, would provide an explanation for
homicides being solved or remaining unsolved. Based on Gottfredson and Hindelang's
(1979) theory, however, non-discretional, case-specific factors would play a key role in
explaining why some homicides are solved while others remain unsolved. The results did
not provide overwhelming support for either of the two theoretical approaches, because,
in all countries except Switzerland, differences in homicide clearance were found in both
discretional (victim-based) and non-discretional (case-based) characteristics. Rather
than these theoretical perspectives providing explanations for the likelihood of a homi-
cide being cleared, we believe that, for these four European countries, the answer lies in
the characteristics of the most prevalent types of homicide per country.
Perhaps not surprisingly, homicides that take place in the private realm overall had the
highest clearance rates. Not only are victims killed in a private location most likely to be
killed by a family member or someone they know (Litwin, 2004), making the number of
suspects limited, such homicides are also frequently followed by the suicide of the per-
petrator. Prior studies show homicide­suicide rates in Finland and Switzerland to be
considerably higher than in other European countries, with rates in Finland ranging from
0.17 to 0.20 per 100,000 (Kivivuori and Lehti, 2003; Saleva et al., 2007) and rates in
Switzerland hovering around 0.09 per 100,000 (Liem et al., 2011) compared with rates
of 0.07 in Sweden (Regoeczi et al., 2016) and 0.05 per 100,000 (Liem et al., 2011) in the
Netherlands, respectively. The relatively high prevalence of homicide­suicide in Finland
and Switzerland could partly explain the relatively high clearance rate in these countries
compared with the Netherlands and Sweden.
From a different point of view, the low clearance rates in the Netherlands and Sweden
could be explained by the relatively high prevalence of criminal milieu related homicides
in these countries and the low clearance rates associated with these types of crimes.
Factors associated with such criminal homicides, such as male victims, victims with an
ethnic minority background and the use of firearms, were found to be significant predic-
tors of homicide clearance in both countries. Among such homicides, even though victim
Liem et al. 17
and perpetrator may know each other, witnesses are not likely to share information
(Litwin, 2004). Similarly, owing to the lack of physical contact between victim and per-
petrator, firearms used in these homicides leave little physical evidence to work with
(Alderden and Lavery, 2007) and hence, in line with findings reported in prior US studies
(Roberts, 2007), result in lower clearance rates.
It should be noted that the relationship between homicide clearance and the use of
firearms was not present in either Finland or Switzerland. In neither of these countries
did the use of a firearm have an impact on the homicide clearance rate. In Finland, about
40 percent of households own at least one firearm. They are mainly hunting rifles and
shotguns;handgunownershipisrareasinotherWestEuropeancountries.ForSwitzerland,
as Bänziger and Killias (2014) have pointed out, the lack of such a relationship may be
attributed to some specificities of gun possession in Switzerland. Because of the militia
system and a widespread tradition of hunting and collecting firearms, roughly one in four
Swiss households owns at least one firearm. The situation is in many ways similar in
Finland. In both countries these firearms are relatively often involved in cases of domes-
tic homicide (Markwalder and Killias, 2012; Lehti, 2016), which by their very nature
have a high clearance rate.
Firearm homicides in the Netherlands and Sweden, however, appear to be solved at a
significantly lower rate (see Tables 2, 4b and 4c). This can be explained by the nature of
firearm ownership in these countries. Legal gun ownership is relatively high in Sweden,
as roughly one in eight households possesses at least one gun (Granath, 2015). In the
Netherlands, less than 5 percent of all households own a firearm (Van Kesteren, 2013).
What these countries have in common is that firearm use in homicide is mainly concen-
trated in the use of illegal firearms in homicides in the criminal milieu or other urban
`street' homicides (Granath, 2015), and seldom in domestic settings.
Further, based on the finding that homicides in the private realm were easier to solve,
one would also expect that homicides involving women, children and elderly victims
would be cleared at high rates, because these victims are typically killed in the private
realm rather than in public places. Although, for the most part, this held true in terms of
homicides with female victims, we did not find straightforward support for higher clear-
ance rates among very young or very old victims. One explanation could lie in the fact
that neonaticides ­ the killing of a new-born ­ are included among very young victims.
Because of the hidden nature of the pregnancy and the killing itself, such cases often
remain unsolved (Brookman and Nolan, 2006). The greater difficulty of clearing cases
involving elderly victims have previously been reported elsewhere (Addington, 2006;
Puckett and Lundman, 2003), suggesting that victim age may not have a linear relation-
ship with homicide clearance (Regoeczi et al., 2008). Elderly victims, particularly elderly
victims living alone, may be killed in robbery homicides without witnesses, which are
generally known for a lower clearance rate (Bänziger and Killias, 2014; Regoeczi et al.,
2008).
Another explanation may lie in the nature of victimization and lifestyle. In a prior
study on unsolved homicides in Switzerland, Bänziger and Killias (2014) found a strong
nexus between homosexuality and clearance rate. Accounts of similar cleared cases
revealed that (older) homosexual men often take other men to their homes with the pur-
pose of having paid sex. The authors stated it was not possible to examine whether the
18 European Journal of Criminology 00(0)
victims died in the circumstances including paid sex. However, homicides occurring in
contexts where men without known ties operate are extremely difficult to solve.
Methodological considerations
This is the first study to provide an overview of homicide clearance in four West European
countries. Using similar definitions and a uniform coding scheme, this study allowed for
unique cross-country comparisons in factors influencing differences in homicide clear-
ance. In spite of our consistent, standardized methodological approach, this study is not
without flaws. First, this study did not include cases of missing persons where no body
was found. In all four countries, such cases are usually labelled as a disappeared person,
even if the police strongly suspect a homicide. Following other studies (Sturup et al.,
2015), because of the unknown nature of these cases (including potential suicides or
voluntary disappearances), these cases have not been included in the study. This may
have resulted in a general under-count of the total number of homicides, including an
under-count of unsolved homicides.
Further, whereas some countries have homicide monitoring systems available with a
great level of detail, which allows for the assessment of factors such as alcohol intoxication
in victims and perpetrators (Lehti and Kivivuori, 2005; Sturup et al., 2015), criminal record
of victims and perpetrators (Sturup et al., 2015), or sexual orientation of victims (Bänziger
and Killias, 2014), this level of detail was not available in all participating countries. This
level of detail would allow us to assess a third theoretical perspective, in addition to the
victim devaluation (discretional) and event characteristics (non-discretional) points of view,
namely the lifestyle perspective (Rydberg and Pizarro, 2014). Lifestyle theory posits that
particular lifestyle choices, such as going out at night and spending time away from the
home, may contribute to future (homicide) victimization by facilitating convergence in time
and space with potential offenders and other risky situations (Rydberg and Pizarro, 2014).
Homicides taking place between individuals equally enmeshed in a deviant lifestyle may
significantly complicate the clearance of such cases. In our work on the EHM, we continue
to optimize the degree and level of detail of information to test these and other hypotheses.
Also, even though we are able to apply the same EHM coding scheme to our national
datasets, allowing for exceptionally high internal validity, owing to national data protec-
tion acts we were not able to merge raw, potentially identifiable data from our national
datasets into one dataset for this study. We hope that future endeavours to meet these
legal ramifications will allow us to combine our data and to conduct multivariate analy-
ses across countries.
Finally, prior research suggests that much is to be learned from shifting the conceptu-
alization of clearance from the traditional dichotomy of cleared/uncleared to an examina-
tion of the length of time to clearance (Regoeczi et al., 2008). Based on the findings
presented in this paper, this may be particularly relevant for Switzerland. An alternative
modelling decision (that is, one based on time-to-solve) might have been more produc-
tive because of the very small number of uncleared homicides during the examined time
period. In terms of future research, the inclusion of time-to-solve and other data such as
the density, structure, expertise and operations of police departments may help improve
our understanding of homicide clearance.
