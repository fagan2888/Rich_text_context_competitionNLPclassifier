With hypotheses derived from a life course perspective in conjunction with life event stress and role theories, we
examine whether a spouse's employment and length of retirement affect a person's postretirement depressive
symptoms and whether such effects differ by gender. Analyses use pooled data from Waves 1­4 of the Health and
Retirement Survey, using a subsample of married individuals who either remained continuously employed over
time or completely retired since the Wave 1 interviews (N = 2,695). Recently retired men seem to be negatively
affected by their spouses' continuous employment when compared with men whose wives were continuously not
employed. In contrast, spouses' joint retirement has a beneficial influence on both recently retired and longer-
retired men. However, for recently retired men, the positive effect of wives' retirement seems to be contingent on
spouses' enjoyment of joint activities. Among women, effects of spouses' employment occur only among very
recently retired wives (0­6 months). These wives report more depressive symptoms if their spouses were already
nonemployed prior to wives' retirement. These results demonstrate the complexity of retirement adaptation
processes and suggest that marital context plays an important role in retirement well-being.
INCREASES in the labor force participation of middle-aged
wives imply that, for many spouses, retirement has become
a ``couple event'' (Szinovacz & Ekerdt, 1995). Dual-earner
couples organize and experience the retirement transition not
only in terms of their own but also in regard to their spouse's
retirement. Although several earlier studies have addressed the
question of how selected couple retirement patterns influence
postretirement marital quality or well-being, many of these
studies were limited because of their reliance on small or
nonrepresentative samples such as data from retirees of specific
firms (Kim & Moen, 2002; Moen, Kim, & Hofmeister, 2001),
use of retrospective or cross-sectional data (Lee & Shehan,
1989; Skirboll & Silverman, 1992), or an exclusive focus on
men's retirement (Myers & Booth, 1996). We revisit this topic
by using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement
Survey (HRS; Juster & Suzman, 1995) and a theoretical
framework that integrates assumptions from the life course
perspective with assumptions pertaining to phases of re-
tirement, gender role ideology, and marital context.
Theoretical Framework
Earlier studies on postretirement well-being focused either on
retirees' activities and roles or on selected resources such as
health, finances, or marital status (for reviews see Atchley,
1976; Kosloski, Ginsburg, & Backman, 1984; Ross & Drentea,
1998). In contrast, the theoretical framework informing our
approach relies foremost on the life course perspective.
According to life course theory, an understanding of life course
transitions such as retirement requires consideration of context,
linked life spheres, and timing, trajectories, and pathways
(Settersten, 2003). Life transitions are contextually embedded;
that is, adaptation to life transitions not only depends on the
occurrence of the transition per se but also on the specific
contexts under which the transition takes place. In the case of
retirement, the most important contexts include former work
roles and work history, health, finances, and marital status
(Bosse
´, Aldwin, Levenson, & Workman-Daniels, 1991; Cala-
santi, 1996a; Kim & Moen, 2002; Richardson & Kilty, 1991;
Szinovacz, 1989). Furthermore, the experience of life transitions
is contingent on developments in other life spheres (linked
lives). We focus on the marital relationship and especially on
spouses' employment and retirement. The concepts of timing,
trajectories, and pathways refer to development within and
across life spheres. Timing of life events is important in regard
to cultural norms and personal expectations; that is, off-time
events tend to undermine well-being (Hagestad, 1990).
Trajectories refer to development within a life sphere such as
the work or retirement career. Specific work career trajectories
(e.g., those ensuring adequate pension coverage and thus
sufficient postretirement income; see O'Rand & Henretta,
1999) may enhance retirement well-being, whereas others may
hinder it (e.g., unstable work patterns; see Marshall, Clarke, &
Ballantyne, 2001). Pathways refer to the combination of
trajectories from different life spheres and the timing of life
transitions in relation to each other. For example, spouses may
enter retirement jointly or separately. In addition to its emphasis
on contexts, linked lives, and transitions, the life course
perspective pays tribute to the gendered nature of life
experiences. Consistent evidence suggests that spouses experi-
ence the marital relationship differently--Bernard (1973)
speaks of a ``his and her'' marriage. Whereas evidence
concerning gender differences in postretirement well-being is
inconsistent (Carp, 1997; Slevin & Wingrove, 1995), studies
indicate that both retirement contexts and retirement meanings
vary by gender (Calasanti, 1996b; O'Rand & Henretta, 1999;
Szinovacz, 1991).

Although the life course perspective provides a general
framework for assessing effects of life transitions on well-being,
it does not provide specific hypotheses about the influences of
contexts, trajectories, or pathways. We thus rely on selected
concepts and assumptions from other theories for hypothesis
development. These include assumptions about phases of
retirement adaptation, gender role ideology, and marital quality.
Retirement phases. --Adaptation to life transitions may vary
over time. Atchley (1976) first suggested five phases of
retirement adaptation--honeymoon, disenchantment, reorienta-
tion, stability, and termination. Although the length of these
phases may vary considerably, our analyses focus on retirement
over one wave of the HRS, typically a period of 2 years, and
thus are likely to reflect only the honeymoon and disenchant-
ment phases (for a discussion of the HRS, see the Methods
section). Some research provides support for a honeymoon
phase, that is, an initial euphoric reaction to retirement, followed
by some decline in well-being (Ekerdt, Bosse
´, & Levkoff, 1985;
Richardson & Kilty, 1995), but other studies failed to sustain
this pattern, especially for women (Kim & Moen, 2002;
Richardson & Kilty, 1995). If retirement phases do indeed
exist, short-term retirees should report fewer depressive
symptoms than longer-term retirees. However, this effect may
be contingent on marital context, especially spouses' employ-
ment and marital quality.
Gender role ideology and retirement patterns of couples. --
Previous research has shown that spouses strive toward joint
retirement (Allmendinger, Bru
¨ckner, & Bru
¨ckner, 1991; Blau,
1998; Henkens, 1999; Szinovacz & DeViney, 2000; Zimmer-
man, Mitchell, Wister, & Gutman, 2000) and that continued
employment of the wife after the husband's retirement is
associated with reduced postretirement well-being (Moen et al.,
2001; Myers & Booth, 1996; Szinovacz, 1996; Szinovacz &
Schaffer, 2000). It has been argued that this timing pattern
undermines the husband's status as the main provider and
reduces his power in the marital relationship (Davey &
Szinovacz, 2004; Kulik, 1996; Kulik & Bareli, 1997; Szinovacz
& Harpster, 1993), both conditions that apparently hinder
retirement adjustment. The disenchantment associated with the
retired husband­employed wife pattern seems more pronounced
among husbands. In light of the negative effect of the wife's
continued employment on the husband's postretirement well-
being, husbands in this situation are unlikely to experience
a retirement honeymoon. We thus expect a retirement honey-
moon effect, as reflected by relatively lower levels of depressive
symptoms, for husbands whose wives were already not
employed at baseline (Hypothesis 1a) or retired during the
same time span as their husbands (Hypothesis 1b).
Given that many couples aim for joint retirement, we expect
wives to benefit from this retirement pattern as do husbands.
Little is known about retirement adjustment of spouses after the
wives' retirement, especially if the husbands continue to work.
In contrast to the nonnormative character of husbands'
retirement prior to their wives, this retirement pattern is
consistent with the traditional provider role. Some research
suggests that the retirement of wives prior to that of their
husbands may profit husbands but not the wives themselves
(Szinovacz & Schaffer, 2000), but other evidence indicates that
husbands' and wives' adjustment to retirement is linked (Haug,
Belgrave, & Jones, 1992). The positive impact of the retirement
of wives prior to that of their husbands on postretirement well-
being may reflect a resolution of disagreements surrounding
wives' employment or a reduction in stress associated with
employed wives' overload problems. We thus predict a re-
tirement honeymoon, as reflected by relatively lower levels of
depressive symptoms, for recently retired wives who retired
jointly with their spouses (Hypothesis 2a) or whose husbands
continued to work (Hypothesis 2b).
Life event stress and marital quality. --The disruption in
lifestyle and daily routines caused by life transitions has been
linked to stress (Burke, 1991; Burke, 1996; Diehl, 1999;
Kessler, Price, & Wortman, 1985; Pearlin, Lieberman,
Menaghan, & Mullan, 1981). However, the extent of stress,
and indeed whether stress occurs at all, is contingent on se-
lected characteristics of the transition (Burke, 1991; Thoits,
1991; Wheaton, 1990; Wheaton, 1996). Most important for our
analyses is the insight that the stress associated with life
transitions depends on the salience of life spheres. Exits from
salient spheres are more stressful, whereas availability of
alternative salient life spheres reduces stress. Indeed, studies
indicate that being married and having a high-quality marriage
contribute to postretirement well-being (Atchley, 1992; Cala-
santi, 1996a; Kelly & Westcott, 1991; Niederfranke, 1989;
Reitzes, Mutran, & Fernandez, 1996), whereas marital prob-
lems enhance perceptions of retirement-related hassles (Bosse
´
et al., 1991). Implementation of a couple-oriented postretire-
ment lifestyle most likely requires that spouses enjoy joint
endeavors. Such endeavors are bound to intensify the salience
of the marital relationship and have been found to be
particularly important for postretirement marriages (Dorfman,
Heckert, Hill, & Kohout, 1988; Vinick & Ekerdt, 1991). We
thus expect the aforementioned hypothesized relationships to be
contingent on couples' enjoyment of joint activities. Specifi-
cally, the predicted honeymoon effect after joint retirement or
a wife's retirement prior to her husband's is expected to be
stronger among couples enjoying joint activities than among
those who do not enjoy joint activities (Hypothesis 3).
METHODS
Sample
In our analyses we use data from the HRS, which was
launched in 1992. The HRS is a longitudinal survey of
households (the interviewed are the primary respondent and his
or her spouse) that is conducted biannually. The data are in the
public domain. Our analyses rely on Waves 1­4 (1992, 1994,
1996, and 1998). The primary original sample for the HRS
consists of main respondents aged 51­61 years at Wave 1 and
their spouses, regardless of the spouses' age (N ¼ 12,652
respondents; 7,702 households). Selection of households was
based on a multistage area probability design with oversamples
for minorities and persons residing in Florida. The response rate
was more than 80% (for further details see Heeringa &
Rodgers, 1998, and Juster & Suzman, 1995).
The selection of the subsample for our analyses is guided by
the assumption that divergent preretirement contexts influence
postretirement well-being. From this perspective it is more
SZINOVACZ AND DAVEY
P234
important to restrict variability in the baseline population than to
attain full generalizability of results. For the subsample used in
our analyses, we first identified all HRS individuals aged 40 or
older (the main respondents or their spouses) from couples with
at least one age-eligible partner (i.e., age 51­61) who were
employed 10 hr or more at baseline and did not define
themselves as retirees. From this subsample we then selected
persons who were either continuously employed throughout all
four waves or who self-defined as ``completely retired'' at
Waves 2, 3, or 4 and had left the labor force (the HRS retirement
measures are discussed in the paragraphs that follow). The
exclusion of Time 1 nonemployed or retired persons was
necessary because we would lack baseline data for this
population. We also excluded individuals working fewer than
10 hr at Time 1. This population may be underemployed or
already in postretirement bridge jobs. Because our analyses
focus on spouses' employment status and retirement, we further
restricted the sample to persons who were married at baseline
and reported no change in marital status or partners at Time 2,
yielding a final subsample of 2,904 individuals. We lost an
additional 122 persons whose partners did not participate in the
surveys, and we lost some respondents (varying by analysis but
fewer than 100) because there were missing values we could
not impute. The final sample consists of 2,695 respondents,
of whom 1,367 were men and 1,328 were women. After
identifying these subsamples, we added information from
spouses to each individual's file through the matching of
records by household and partner identification. It should be
noted that current retirees in the HRS tend to have retired early
(i.e., before 62­65 years of age). Thus, our data may not be
generalizable to those retiring in their mid to late 60s.
The analyses pool persons who retired between Waves 1 and
2, Waves 2 and 3, and Waves 3 and 4. Such pooling is
necessary to achieve a sufficient number of cases for our
complex analyses. It also creates a sample basis that addresses
similar retirement transitions for all respondents, namely the
transition from work to full-time retirement within the past 2
years. We recognize that many individuals do not follow this
retirement path; they retire gradually. In line with our aim to
explore clearly identifiable transition patterns (in the sense of
Weberian ideal types), we focus on the full retirement pattern,
which is also the most common in our sample. In each case, the
earlier wave data serve as baseline and the later wave data as
basis for the construction of change and outcome variables. For
continuously employed workers, we randomly assigned
respondents to waves to achieve relatively equal representation
of waves in the analyses. We also controlled for wave to further
exclude potential cohort or period effects. In the remainder of
the article, we refer to the baseline data as Time 1 and the
outcome wave as Time 2.
Losses of data caused by attrition or missing responses can
bias results. We dealt with both issues. We adjusted for
a potential attrition bias through weights that account for sample
selection and nonparticipation biases as well as attrition. The
HRS provides multistage sampling weights that correct for
sample selection and nonresponse biases but do not account for
attrition. To adjust for attrition, we estimated a logistic
regression equation that predicted being in Wave 3. This used
gender, race, marital status, various health measures (drinking,
smoking, body mass index, self-rated health, depression, and
limitations in activities of daily living, or ADLs), occupation,
income, assets, pension, job satisfaction, point of origin
(foreign), social contacts with neighbors, proxy interview, and
participation in the Wave 2 interview as independent variables.
The equation used the multistage sampling weights in the
estimation of standard errors. From this equation we calculated
the probability of being in Waves 2, 3, or 4 for each respondent.
We then multiplied the inverse of this probability by the sam-
pling weight to arrive at a final weight that includes the
probability of being in the sample and being in all waves. The
attrition weight is normalized so that weighted ns in the overall
sample correspond to observed ns.
Imputation of missing values is recommended especially for
longitudinal studies (Little & Rubin, 1989) to allow general-
izations from the original sample. Except for missing values on
the employment or retirement variables used to select our
subsample, we used multiple imputations to correct for
selective nonresponse. These imputations provide valid stan-
dard errors for all model parameter estimates (Davey, 2001;
Davey, Shanahan, & Schafer, 2001; Schafer, 1997). Repeated
draws were made using a standard noninformative prior and
imputing every 2,000 iterations to construct five complete data
sets. We analyzed each imputed data set separately, and we
then pooled results to arrive at final estimates of parameters and
their standard errors. Note that some variables were already
imputed in the HRS or the data set distributed by RAND (e.g.,
financial information). Where available, we used the HRS or
RAND imputations.
Measures
The main dependent variable is depressive symptoms. We
measured depressive symptoms with selected items from the
Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale
(see Radloff, 1977). The items, wording, and scaling of
measures from the CES-D scale differed between the first wave
of the HRS and subsequent waves, and this is discussed
extensively elsewhere (Steffeck, 2000). A random subsample of
808 individuals received both measures (the original Wave 1
measure and the new Wave 2 measure) at Wave 2. For Wave 1
(a¼.80) and for the Wave 2 subsample receiving both measures
(a¼.81), the original CES-D categories were 0¼rarely or none
of the time, 1 ¼ some of the time, 2 ¼ most of the time, and 3 ¼
all or almost all of the time. For subsequent waves, responses
were coded as yes (1) or no (0) in response to the item stem
``Much of the time during the past week you felt . . ..''
To achieve comparable measures between the first and
subsequent waves, we used the following procedure. Beginning
with the eight comparable domains (felt depressed, everything
was an effort, sleep was restless, felt happy, felt lonely, enjoyed
life, felt sad, couldn't get going), we reverse coded positively
worded items, and we summed the eight items according to their
original coding. From these scales, we next estimated a re-
gression equation to predict Wave 2 scale scores (a ¼ .85) from
Wave 2 scores on the module version, and from self-rated
health, relative health (compared with a year ago), emotional
health, limitations in activities of daily living, race (Black; other
minority; White as reference category), age, age squared, and
gender. The resulting regression equation predicted 71% of the
variance in Wave 2 scale scores. We then used this equation to
estimate Wave 1 rescaled scores. In order to allow for
DEPRESSION AND SPOUSAL EMPLOYMENT P235
uncertainty in these estimates, we added a normally distributed
random variate with a mean of 0 and variance equal to the mean
square error from the Time 2 equation to all estimates. To verify
that estimated rescaled scores behaved in a similar fashion to
the newly scaled Wave 2 scores, we compared correlation
coefficients between Wave 1 (original scale) scores and esti-
mated Wave 1 rescaled scores with the correlation coefficients
between Wave 2 module scores and Wave 2 scores. The
former correlation coefficient was .82 and the latter was .83.
Clearly, then, the behavior of our rescaled version of the Wave 1
CES-D scale was highly consistent with what was observed with
the Wave 2 data.
The independent variables for the analyses are retirement,
length of retirement, spouse's employment or retirement status
at Times 1 and 2, and spouse's enjoyment of joint activities.
Definitions of retirement can be ambivalent and often vary
across studies. In the HRS, several indicators of retirement are
available (Gustman & Steinmeier, 1995). We use a combination
of labor force status (based on answers to this question: Are you
doing any work for pay at the present time? Yes or no) and the
respondent's self-definition as retiree (derived from answers
to this question: Do you consider yourself partly retired,
completely retired, or not retired at all?). Answer categories
for this question reflect the three retirement statuses implied in
the question (partly, completely, or not retired). For our
analyses, retirees are those who had worked 10 hr or more for
pay in the previous wave, stopped working between waves, and
considered themselves as completely retired at Time 2. Persons
defined as continuous employees worked throughout all four
waves considered here and self-defined as ``not at all retired.''
We defined length of retirement as the time since the
respondent stopped working. We dichotomized this variable
into those who were retired up to 1 year at Time 2 and those
retired more than 1 year. Because the length of retirement phases
is not clear, we also subdivided the first group into those retired
up to 6 months and those retired 7­12 months. Subdivision of
those retired over 1 year is not possible because of the smaller
number of cases in this subgroup. We created dummy variables
for retirement status and length of retirement. Continuously
employed persons serve as reference in the analyses.
For spouses we rely exclusively on employment status (any
pay for work). We labeled spouses who did not work during
both waves as ``not employed,'' those who worked at Time 1 but
had stopped working by Time 2 as ``retirees,'' and those who
worked at Time 2 as ``employed.'' The distribution of couples
by respondent's own and spouse's employment status is shown
in Table 1. The sample selection of persons aged 51 to 61
at Wave 1 leads to a relatively young sample so that most
individuals remain continuously employed. Men are somewhat
more likely than women to have nonemployed spouses, whereas
the proportion of respondents whose spouses retired is slightly
higher for women. In line with earlier research, there is
a pronounced association between respondent's and spouse's
employment status: v2(4)¼62.38 for men and 57.19 for women,
p , .01.
Our other main independent variable is enjoyment of joint
activities with the spouse. We use respondents' answers to this
question: Generally speaking, would you say that the time you
spend together with your (husband, wife, or partner) is extremely
enjoyable, very enjoyable, somewhat enjoyable, or not too
enjoyable? Because most respondents answered positively, we
created a dummy variable that distinguishes respondents who
find time with their spouse ``extremely enjoyable'' from all
others.
Controls
Postretirement well-being has been linked to numerous
predictors. We attempted to include variables that have been
shown most consistently to influence postretirement well-being
in the analyses, provided data were available. The first set of
controls consisted of demographic background variables,
namely, age and race (all analyses were performed separately
by gender). Race was entered in the form of three dummy
variables, that is, Black, Hispanic, and other race (Whites serve
as reference).
Our hypotheses refer to change in depressive symptoms after
retirement. It is, therefore, essential that we control for
preretirement psychological distress. We include depressive
symptoms at Time 1, as well as whether respondents ever had
psychiatric problems measured at baseline.
Foremost among other predictors of postretirement well-
being are health and economic situation (Bosse
´ et al., 1991;
Calasanti, 1996a; Hardy & Quadagno, 1995). For respondents'
health we use four indicators, namely self-rated health and
limitations in ADLs, both measured at baseline, as well as
changes in these indicators between waves. We measured self-
rated health with a single item: Would you say your health
is. . .? Answer categories ranged from poor (1) to excellent (5).
We assessed limitations in ADLs across a variety of domains,
16 of which were consistent across waves and were performed
by sufficient numbers of participants to be useful. These
domains were as follows: walk several blocks; walk one block;
walk across a room; sit for about 2 hr; get up from a chair after
sitting for long periods; get in and out of bed without help;

climb several flights of stairs without resting; climb one flight
of stairs without resting; lift or carry weights over 10 lb; stoop,
kneel, or crouch; pick up a dime from a table; bathe or shower
without help; reach or extend your arms above shoulder level;
push or pull large objects such as a living room chair; eat
without help; and dress without help) However, there were
some differences in item scaling across waves. To ensure
comparability, we recoded items to 1 if the individual reported
having any difficulty with the tasks, 0 if he or she did not, and
missing if the individual reported that he or she did not perform
a task. We then used the mean number of ADLs (multiplied by
16 to retain the original scaling) in subsequent analyses. The
final score could thus range from 0 to 16. The coefficient alpha
for Waves 1 and 3 was a¼.86 and for Wave 2 was a¼.87. We
assessed changes in health with simple change scores, that is,
the difference between Time1 and Time 2 scores. In the case of
self-rated health, positive change scores indicate an increase in
self-rated health. For limitations in ADLs, positive change
scores reflect increases in limitations.
We used two measures to capture financial status--couples'
income and net worth. The former variable includes income of
both spouses from all income sources. Net worth reflects
couples' assets minus their debts. We rely on RAND imputed
income data, which are comparable over waves. In addition, we
computed changes in assets and income between waves.
Preliminary analyses revealed that asset changes and income
had no influence on results, and these variables were dropped in
the final models. We retained assets at baseline and change in
income between waves. We logged all income measures to
adjust for skewed distributions.
The other socioeconomic status variable included in the
analyses was education (coded in years). We also considered
current or last occupation, but this variable had no effect on
results and was dropped from the final models. We further
included selected job characteristics. Respondents were asked
whether their jobs required lots of physical effort; lifting heavy
loads; stooping, kneeling, or crouching; good eyesight; intense
concentration; or skill in dealing with people. Answer
categories for these items ranged from 4 (almost all of the
time) to 1 (none or almost none of the time). A second item
battery referred to job difficulty (my job requires me to do
more difficult things than it used to; my job involves a lot of
stress). Answers could range from 4 (strongly agree) to 1
(strongly disagree). On the basis of factor analyses (available
from A. Davey), we created three job characteristic variables:
stress (job more difficult, job involves stress; a for the full
sample ranges from .93 to .95 over the four waves);
concentration (job requires intense concentration, requires
people skills, requires good eyesight; a ranges from .96 to
.98); and physical effort (physical effort, lifting, stooping; a
ranges from .93 to .94). Items for each subscale were summed.
Concentration had little effect on results and was dropped from
the final models.
As postretirement well-being may be linked to individuals'
work commitment, we also included indicators for this concept,
namely, number of years in the current or last job (this is the
best work history variable available in the HRS) and perception
of the importance of work. We derived the latter variable from
the question concerning whether individuals considered work
mostly important as a source of income or whether they valued
their work in itself; we coded it as 1¼only income important, 2
¼ both important, and 3 ¼ work itself important.
Another important predictor of postretirement well-being is
whether retirement is perceived as voluntary (Hardy &
Quadagno, 1995). Interviewers asked retirees whether retire-
ment ``was something you wanted to do or something you felt
you were forced into?'' The answer categories were as follows:
wanted to, forced into, and part wanted, part forced. Because the
last category was not implied in the question, relatively few
individuals chose that answer. We thus created one dummy
variable in which those reporting exclusive ``forced'' retirement
were coded as 1 and the other two groups were coded as 0.
The final set of controls refers to marital characteristics and
family and friend relations. For marital characteristics, we
included length of marriage (in years, based on RAND
computations) as well as spouse's limitations in ADLs and
change in spouse's ADLs over time. The latter two variables
were coded the same way as those for respondents. The family­
friend variables included whether respondents had grand-
children (own or spouse's; 1 ¼ yes and 0 ¼ no), as well as an
index of social integration based on responses (1 ¼ yes and 0 ¼
no) to questions concerning whether respondents had children
or stepchildren living within 10 miles, whether they had other
relatives in the neighborhood, and whether they had friends in
the neighborhood. The social integration index summed scores
over these three variables and could range from 0 to 3. We
measured the family­friend variables at Time 2. For length of
marriage we used the baseline wave. Means and standard
deviations of all variables are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
Analyses
Our analyses are based on ordinary least squares (OLS)
regressions adjusted for complex survey design (Stata, 2003),
with standard errors based on 1,000 bootstrapped samples to
adjust for heteroscedasticity (Efron & Tibshirani, 1986). We
also considered alternative statistical models including Poisson
regression with overdispersion and zero inflation, and interval
regression (Amemiya, 1984; Fahrmeir & Tutz, 1994; Greene,
1990; Long, 1997). These analyses led to essentially the same
results as the OLS models, which we present here for ease of
interpretation.
The analyses were set up to test the hypotheses separately for
men and women. In Table 2 we present results for men who
retired or remained continuously employed (reference) with
specific wife employment status categories as predictors,
whereas in Table 3 we show findings for women who either
retired or remained continuously employed (reference) with
husbands' employment status categories as predictors. To test
specific hypotheses pertaining to spousal employment status, we
designed models with divergent spouse employment status
categories as reference categories. In each case, we first

included the interaction between Own retirement 3 Spouse's
employment 3 Enjoyment of joint activities. Tests for multi-
collinearity suggested that this was not a problem for our
analyses (mean variance inflation was ,2.00 for all analyses
excluding the interaction terms).
RESULTS
The subsamples used for our analyses, as well as the
estimated models, are geared to test the hypothesized relation-
ships. Although results pertaining to other predictors of
postretirement depressive symptoms may be of interest, we
consequently focus our discussion exclusively on effects of
retirement, length of retirement, spouse's employment status,
and enjoyment of activities with the spouse. However, the full
models including all covariates are shown in Tables 2 and 3
along with the relevant interaction effects. Preliminary analyses
indicated that the effects of men's retirement were similar for 0­
6 and 7­12 months postretirement, whereas those for women
were different for these periods. We consequently present
models for men that distinguish solely between recent (1 year)
and longer-term (.
1 year) retirees (Table 2), whereas the
analyses for women refer to three separate postretirement
periods (0­6 months, 7­12 months, and .
1 year; see Table 3).
All analyses control for depressive symptoms at Time 1. The
results thus reflect depressive symptoms at Time 2 net of Time 1
symptoms. To ease interpretation of results, we also present the
significant interaction effects in figures that were derived from
the Tables and are adjusted for mean levels on all covariates.
Our initial analyses, for which we presented no hypotheses,
indicated that none of the independent variables (length of
retirement, spouse's employment status, and enjoyment of joint
activities) exerted a significant main effect on men's depressive
symptoms at Time 2 (Table 2, Models 1a and 1b). For women
(Table 3, Model 1b) we find a negative effect of spouse's
retirement; this suggests that women, regardless of their own
employment status, reported fewer depressive symptoms if their
spouse retired than if he continued working.
Next, we tested our study hypotheses. For men we
hypothesized fewer depressive symptoms at Time 2 if they
were recently retired and their wives were either continuously
not working (Hypothesis 1a) or retired between waves
(Hypothesis 1b). To test the first hypothesis (the hypothesized
coefficients are set in boldface in the tables), we contrasted
recently retired husbands whose wives were continuously
nonworking (reference) with those whose wives remained
employed (Table 2, Model 2a). The finding supports the
hypothesis. As shown in Figure 1 (first two bars for recent
retirees), recently retired men reported more depressive
symptoms when their spouses worked (b ¼ .90, p , .01) than
when their spouses were continuously not employed (reference).
No similar effect of spouse's employment shows for long-term
retired husbands (b ¼ À.10, ns in Model 2a; first two bars for
long-term retired men in Figure 1).
Hypothesis 1b pertains to the effect of joint retirement on
husbands' depressive symptoms. We tested this hypothesis by
contrasting recently retired husbands whose wives remained
employed (reference) and those whose wives retired (see Model
2b in Table 2). The results again confirm the hypothesis.
Recently retired men whose wives retired report significantly
fewer depressive symptoms (b ¼ À.71, p , .05; see last two
bars for recently retired men in Figure 1) than those whose
wives remained employed (reference). In this case, however,
the effect for longer-term retired men is similar although it only
approaches significance (b ¼ À.67, p , .10; last two bars for
long-term retired men in Figure 1).
In addition to the hypothesized effects, the data also revealed
that longer-retired men whose spouses retired between waves
reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than longer-
retired husbands whose wives were continuously not employed
(Model 2a, b ¼À.76, p ,. 05, first and last bar for long-term
retired men in Figure 1).
Thus, in line with Hypotheses 1a and 1b, recently retired men
seem to be negatively affected by their spouses' continued
employment as compared with husbands whose wives were
already nonworking prior to the husband's retirement or retired
jointly with him. The longer-term effects of spouse's
employment status seem to depend on whether the wife was
continuously nonemployed during the husband's retirement
transition or retired during the same period. Longer-retired men
fare particularly well if they retired jointly with their spouses
but less well if their wives either remain employed or were
already nonworking prior to the husband's retirement.
Among women, effects of the spouse's employment or
retirement generally seem more short lived than among men;
that is, differences by spouse's employment status occurred
foremost among women retired 6 months or less. Our
hypotheses for wives (2a and 2b) predict that short-term retired
wives will report fewer depressive symptoms if they either
retired jointly with their husbands (2a) or if their husbands
continued to work (2b). To test these hypotheses, we first
contrasted women retirees whose husbands had retired with
those whose husbands were continuously not employed (Table
3, Model 2a). The data provide support for Hypothesis 2a. Very
recently retired women (within 6 months) whose spouses retired
between waves had significantly fewer depressive symptoms
than women whose husbands were continuously not employed
(Table 3, Model 2a, b¼À.97, p , .05; see first and third bars for
recently retired women in Figure 2). To test Hypothesis 2b, we
contrasted recent women retirees whose spouses were contin-
uously employed with those whose spouses were continuously

employment­retirement, length of retirement, and spouse's employ-
ment­retirement.

not employed. The data again support the hypothesis. Recently
retired women whose husbands remained employed reported
significantly fewer depressive symptoms than those whose
husbands were continuously not employed (Table 3, Model 2a,
b¼À1.09, p , .01; see first and second bars for recently retired
women in Figure 2). In contrast to the findings for men (but in
line with our hypotheses), very recent women retirees whose
husbands retired jointly with them do not differ from those
whose husbands remained employed (b ¼ .11, ns in Table 3,
Model 2b; second and third bars for recently retired women in
Figure 2). These data confirm a honeymoon effect especially for
recently retired women who either retired before or jointly with
their spouses, consistent with Hypotheses 2a and 2b. We find no
significant effects of spouses' employment status for women
retired 7 months or more.
We further hypothesized (Hypothesis 3) that the effects of
joint retirement or wife's retirement prior to her husband's
would be strongest when spouses enjoyed their time together. In
order to test this third hypothesis, we added a three-way
interaction between own length of retirement, spouse's
employment status, and enjoyment of joint activities. Our
assumption was supported only for recently retired men who
retired jointly with their wives. Recently retired men whose
wives retired between waves and who enjoy joint activities
reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than recent
male retirees with retired spouses who derive less satisfaction
from joint endeavors (see Table 2, Model 3a, and last two bars in
Figure 3). Because none of these effects were significant for
women, they are not included in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
Informed by a life course approach in conjunction with
selected assumptions about retirement phases, gender role
ideology, and marital context, the preceding analyses tested
whether length of retirement, spouse's employment status, and
enjoyment of joint activities influence postretirement depressive
symptoms.
Generally, our research supports a life course approach to
retirement adaptation and indicates that the retirement experi-
ence is quite heterogeneous and contingent on the specific
contexts under which retirement occurs. Furthermore, the
influence of such contexts may change over time or, in the
case of couples, encourage retirement of the partner. This
heterogeneity of retirement experiences raises questions about
earlier studies that only assess the direct effect of retirement
on well-being and ignore contingencies of the retirement
experience (Calasanti, 1996a; Charles, 2002; Gall, Evans, &
Howard, 1997). Such research will tend to show little influence
of retirement on well-being as positive and negative experi-
ences are averaged and thus provide few insights to guide
retirement preparation and planning. Indeed, our data offer little
support for a general effect of length of retirement on well-
being, precisely because responses to retirement (including the
experience of a honeymoon) seem to be dependent on selected
retirement contexts. Furthermore, if a retirement honeymoon
period exists at all, it is not clear, as Atchley (1976) pointed out,
how long this phase lasts. Our results suggest that the
honeymoon may last longer among men than among women.
True tests of retirement phases probably also require more
frequent interviews over time, as the analyses of Richardson
and Kilty (1995) suggest as well. If, as our data show,
variability in the retirement experience is particularly pro-
nounced in the immediate aftermath of retirement, then study
designs with a relatively long time span between waves (i.e.,
greater than 6 months) may not capture such variation.
Rather than supporting a general honeymoon effect, the
results offer some support for the hypothesis that length of
retirement and spouse's employment status interact in their
influences on postretirement well-being. Recently retired
husbands report somewhat higher depressive symptoms if their
wives continue to work outside the home. This finding is
consistent with earlier evidence (Moen et al., 2001; Myers &
Booth, 1996; Szinovacz, 1996) as well as with our hypothesis
that wives' continued employment runs counter to traditional
gender role ideology and may therefore undermine retired
husbands' perceived status in the marriage. Other mechanisms
that may contribute to adjustment problems among recently
retired husbands with still employed wives include conflicts
surrounding the division of household labor and the specific
reasons for husbands' retirement prior to their wives. Although

DEPRESSION AND SPOUSAL EMPLOYMENT P241
retired husbands may take over some of their still-employed
wives' housework, their wives still tend to carry the main
responsibility for household work (Szinovacz, 2000). Although
wives may accept such inequity in the division of household
labor as long as their husbands are employed, they may no
longer accept it after husbands' retirement, leading to marital
conflicts that are reflected in husbands' depressive symptoms. In
addition, as one anonymous reviewer suggested, recently retired
husbands with employed wives may feel lonely and bored at
home until they develop postretirement activities and friend-
ships. It is also conceivable that husbands who retire prior to
their wives do so as a result of adverse circumstances such as
unemployment or poor health. Although we control for
``forced'' retirement and health in the analyses, these controls
may not capture the full range of adverse retirement circum-
stances. Clearly, more detailed data are needed to understand the
precise mechanisms leading to the negative influence of wives'
employment on their retired husbands' postretirement well-
being.
The negative effect of wives' continued employment seems to
persist over time, though it is somewhat weaker and only
approaches significance for longer-retired men. Couples may
resolve potential conflicts that arise from this arrangement and
thus reduce its negative influence. Furthermore, retired hus-
bands who are most troubled by their wives' employment may
succeed in persuading their wives to retire. Other research has
shown that retired husbands whose wives are still employed
exert pressure on their wives to retire as well (Skirboll &
Silverman, 1992; Szinovacz, 1989). The latter explanation
would imply that couples remaining in the single-retired
husband status for some time are self-selected; that is, they
underrepresent couples in which husbands are particularly
opposed to wives' continued employment.
We further find that husbands whose wives also retired
between waves are quite happy in retirement. The positive
effect of wives' retirement is particularly pronounced among
longer-retired husbands. This finding suggests that husbands'
retirement honeymoon may be triggered by their wives in
conjunction with or after their own retirement. Perhaps
husbands who initially opposed their wives' continued
employment are particularly happy in the aftermath of their
wives' retirement.
As expected, the positive effect of both spouses' retirement
on husbands' well-being is limited to couples who enjoy joint
activities. Though hardly surprising, this finding once again
demonstrates the contextual nature of retirement adaptation
processes. It also confirms earlier research showing the
importance of high marital quality and joint leisure activities
for retirees' well-being (Bosse
´ et al., 1991; Dorfman et al.,
1988; Vinick & Ekerdt, 1991). However, this effect once again
subsides over time. This suggests, on the one hand, that spouses
who do not enjoy joint activities are able to establish
satisfactory life routines after some time, but this seems to
take them longer than couples who favor joint endeavors. On
the other hand, the euphoria associated with joint retirement
activities among couples enjoying such endeavors may also be
curtailed over time. It might be difficult to maintain high
involvement in particularly enjoyable joint activities such as
travel over long time periods. Couples may then be disap-
pointed that high expectations for joint retirement leisure are no
longer met, and such unmet expectations have been linked to
reduced postretirement well-being (Vinick & Ekerdt, 1992).
It is notable that we do not find a similar interaction with
enjoyment of joint activities for wives. Two explanations for
this result come to mind. First, wives are often responsible for
planning couples' postretirement activities and thus may be
able to gear the couple's retirement endeavors into those
pursuits they themselves enjoy. In this case, couples' previous
enjoyment of joint activities would have little influence on
wives postretirement well-being. Second, husbands more than
wives depend on the spouse for friendships and other social
supports (Huyck, 1995). Thus, wives whose marriages provide
few outlets for joint activities may be better able than husbands
to find alternative social arrangements. Such arrangements
seem to have a similar protective function against high
postretirement depressive symptoms as joint spouse endeavors.
A husband's retirement into a marriage in which the wife
has not been employed for some time has quite different
ramifications for his well-being than joint retirement. Under
this scenario, husbands show relatively few depressive
symptoms in the short term, but they report more depressive
symptoms after 1 year of retirement. This seems to suggest that
after a brief honeymoon, husbands whose wives were not
employed face some adjustment problems. On the basis of
previous research, we suggest that interference and insufficient
distance problems could be responsible for this finding. Wives
of retired husbands sometimes feel that their husbands are
``underfoot'' and impinge on their realm (Ekerdt & Vinick,
1993; Scha
¨uble, 1989; Vinick & Ekerdt, 1991). The often-cited
saying ``I married him for better or for worse but not for lunch''
exemplifies such impingement (Vinick & Ekerdt, 1991b).
Wives with retired husbands may also complain about
curtailment of their privacy and the need to plan retirement
activities for their husbands (Gilford, 1986; Niederfranke,
1991). Women who retired well before their husbands (or who
are housewives) are most likely to have established household
routines and a lifestyle that incorporated their working
husbands' consistent absence from the home. These couples
may have problems finding the right balance of distance and
togetherness (Caradec, 1994), and wives' dissatisfaction with
their husbands' impingement may undermine both spouses'
well-being (linked lives). It is also possible that separate
retirements are more typical for less happily married spouses
who would then lack another salient life sphere after retirement.
The results for wives show more variability in postretirement
depressive symptoms over short time periods of 6 months or
less. These recently retired wives report fewer depressive
symptoms either if they retired jointly with their husbands or if
their husbands remain employed, relative to wives whose
husbands had already exited the labor force. This result
supports a joint retirement honeymoon experience, but in the
case of wives this experience seems to be quite short lived.
Wives whose husbands stopped working before the wife retired
tend to report more depressive symptoms. This couple
retirement pattern is most likely to induce husbands to exert
pressure on their wives to retire as well (Skirboll & Silverman,
1992; Szinovacz, 1989). Such pressure may curtail wives'
control over their retirement decision and eventually undermine
postretirement well-being. It is also conceivable that this
retirement pattern occurs most commonly among couples in
SZINOVACZ AND DAVEY
P242
which the husbands were unable to remain in the labor force
(displaced or disabled men). As already noted, our controls for
husbands' ADLs may be insufficient to capture all negative
effects deriving from husbands' unemployment or disability.
Further analyses differentiating more clearly among truly
retired and displaced or disabled husbands may shed more light
on this issue.
Taken together, the results from this study support
a theoretical framework that combines the life course approach
with selected assumptions from other perspectives. They
demonstrate that it is often not the retirement transition per se
that influences postretirement well-being but rather the specific
circumstances or contexts under which retirement occurs or that
closely follow retirement. Our analyses demonstrate such
contextual effects for spouses' employment and marital quality.
Although several of the hypotheses derived from our theoretical
framework were supported by the data, large data sets such as
the HRS rarely include the detailed information necessary for
unambiguous interpretations. Thus, more research (perhaps
with qualitative data) is needed to definitively explain the
observed trends.
Our data further suggest that postretirement well-being is not
static. This process-oriented view of retirement adaptation is
consistent with an assumption of retirement phases. However,
such phases may be defined not only by time but also by
contextual changes. Because our data are restricted to two time
points, conclusions pertaining to postretirement changes in
terms of length of retirement or the relative timing of spouses'
retirement are tentative. Data comparing retirees over several
waves are needed to address retirement adaptation processes
over time. Use of later waves of the HRS should offer such an
opportunity. Furthermore, the first four waves of the HRS are
restricted to mostly younger and often early (exit before age 62
or age 65) retirees. Consequently, our findings can only be
generalized to this group, and couples retiring later may indeed
have different retirement experiences. Once again, later waves
of the HRS can be used to explore this possibility.
Another limitation of our research pertains to the measure of
marital quality (enjoy time together) and number of cases. The
marital quality measures included in the HRS are quite basic
and highly skewed. Given that interaction effects such as those
tested here require quite large samples, especially to test effects
for more marginal groups (e.g., long-married spouses who do
not enjoy time together), we may very well have found stronger
effects of this variable had we not recoded the data. However,
this would have led to extremely low cell counts and unstable
results. Once more HRS respondents have made the retirement
transition, it should become possible to explore postretirement
experiences among such marginal groups.
Despite these caveats, our results lend themselves to some
suggestions for couples, policy makers, and practitioners.
Couples need to plan not only for their postretirement finances
but also for their postretirement lifestyle. The current problems
associated with the wife's continued employment after the
husband's retirement or with husbands who pressure employed
wives to retire may become less pronounced as less gender-role
traditional cohorts approach retirement. Nevertheless, careful
planning may help couples to achieve retirement timing patterns
that accommodate both spouses. Not only spouses' own actions
but retirement policies and programs that support couples' needs
are essential to further postretirement well-being. Because
husbands are typically somewhat older than their wives, current
Social Security benefit regulations (and many pension plans)
reinforce a retirement pattern in which husbands retire first.
Couples tend to respond by some adjustments in retirement age
(Szinovacz, 2002), which can lead to benefit reductions
especially for wives. Proposals that emphasize a life course
perspective of labor force attachments and leaves would be more
in line with retiring (and younger) couples' needs.
Similarly, couples need to learn, perhaps through retirement
preparation programs or in more extreme cases marital therapy,
how to develop mutually enjoyable endeavors and how to find
the best distance in their postretirement relationship. To be
more useful to couples, retirement preparation programs require
some changes. The nearly exclusive emphasis on financial
issues may distract couples from other potential retirement
problems. Couples would benefit more from these programs
were they to adopt a broader and research-based perspective.
Our research demonstrates the validity of the life course
perspective and the importance of marital context for post-
retirement well-being: How well spouses fare in retirement is
contingent on spouses' employment status as well as marital
quality. They also show that her and his retirement experiences
are indeed different. It is only by capturing such complexities
that we will gain full understanding of retirement adaptation
processes.
