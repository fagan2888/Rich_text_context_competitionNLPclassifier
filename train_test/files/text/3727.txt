Article
Deployment separation is one of the greatest demands of the
military lifestyle on military families as it includes the risk of
injury or death of the service member, as well as additional
responsibilities for the at-home spouse who must adjust to
the role of a single parent (Wright, Riviere, Merrill, &
Cabrera, 2013). Aside from Vietnam, Operation Enduring
Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan has been the longest war the
U.S. military has fought to date, and Operation Iraqi Freedom
(OIF) the third longest (Hosek, 2011). More than 2.1 million
service members have deployed in support of these missions.
Approximately 100,000 (44%) of these service members are
parents, with 48% of these deployed parents having deployed
more than once (Department of Defense, 2010). In this time,
nearly 2 million children experienced a parent's absence due
to deployment (Flake, Davis, Johnson, & Middleton, 2009).
Studies conducted with military families indicate that the
psychological effects of a service member's deployment
extend to their children. For example, the Survey of Army
Families (Orthner & Rose, 2005) reported that approximately
25% of school-age children were depressed because of
deployment separation and 37% reported fear of harm to the
deployed parent. Further evidence comes from a retrospective
cohort study that linked health care visit records of children
with parents' deployment records (Gorman, Eide, & Hisle-
Gorman, 2010), and found that for children aged 3 to 8 years
old, behavioral disorders increased 19% and stress disorders
increased 18% when the military parent was deployed.
Other studies of child psychological adjustment and
parental deployment have found that children aged 3 to 5
years with a deployed parent had significantly higher exter-
nalizing behavior scores and clinically elevated internalizing
behavior when compared with same-aged peers without a
deployed parent (Chartrand, Frank, White, & Shope, 2008).
Children with a deployed parent also experienced more emo-
tional and behavioral difficulties than civilian samples, and

Child Mental Health Symptoms Following
Parental Deployment: The Impact of
Parental Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Symptoms, Marital Distress, and General
Aggression

Abstract
The current study examined the impact of active duty service members' symptoms following a combat deployment on child
mental health symptoms. Soldiers from a brigade combat team (N = 974) participated in the study 2 months following return
from a 15-month combat deployment to Afghanistan, of which 169 soldiers (17.3%) reported having at least one child living
at home. Results supported two research hypotheses examining the interrelationship between parental posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) symptoms, general aggression, and marital distress on child mental health. First, the study documented
a moderate association between parental PTSD symptoms and child mental health symptoms during the postdeployment
reintegration period. This association was significant even after accounting for marital distress. Second, the study demonstrated
that the impact of PTSD symptoms on child mental health symptoms may be explained by parental general aggression such
that aggression mediated the PTSD symptoms­child mental health association.

these difficulties tended to increase with deployment length
(Chandra et al., 2010). Child attachment behaviors also have
been related to length of deployment and number of deploy-
ments (Barker & Berry, 2009), and cumulative length of
parental deployment during the child's lifetime predicted
child depression and externalizing behaviors (White, de
Burgh, Fear, & Iversen, 2011). In one of the few studies
including the previously deployed service member (Lester
et al., 2010), total number of months deployed and parental
distress (both at-home spouse and returned soldier) indepen-
dently predicted child adjustment problems. The returned
soldier's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms
predicted child depression as well as internalizing and exter-
nalizing behaviors. Although these studies support the rela-
tionship between child psychological adjustment and
parental deployment, they do not explain the reasons why
these effects occur. In addition, many studies focus on psy-
chological effects on the family during the deployment sepa-
ration time period rather than on the postdeployment
reintegration period when the service member transitions
back into the family.
To investigate the association between mental health
symptoms in returning service members and the effects on
their children, a targeted assessment to determine possible
pathways and mediators is needed. To this end, the current
study examined the interrelationship between the active duty
service member's PTSD symptoms, general aggression, and
marital distress following a combat deployment on child
mental health symptoms. Two research questions were
examined:
Research Question 1: Can the parental PTSD­child
mental health association be documented for a sample of
active duty service members who had just returned from a
combat deployment, and is the association significant
even after accounting for a known risk factor for child
mental health problems--marital distress?
Research Question 2: Is the impact of PTSD symptoms
in returning service members on child mental health
explained by general aggression of the parent?
PTSD and Child Outcomes
Much of the literature that explores psychological symptoms
in returned war veterans and emotional and behavior conse-
quences for their children has focused on PTSD symptoms as
exacerbating risk for children (Dekel & Goldblatt, 2008).
Several studies have examined parenting behaviors that may
be affected by PTSD symptoms. For example, a longitudinal
study of returned National Guard soldiers and reintegration
effects on the family system (Gewirtz, Polusny, DeGarmo,
Khaylis, & Erbes, 2010) found that PTSD symptoms during
deployment influenced couple adjustment and parenting 1
year later. Positive parenting behaviors, child discipline and
supervision, and involvement and interest in the child's
activities were affected by the soldier's symptoms and
resulted in impaired parent­child interactions.
A review of the literature (Galovski & Lyons, 2004) sum-
marizing the effects of exposure to violence during combat
concluded that PTSD symptoms resulting from such expo-
sure affected family relationships and psychological adjust-
ment. Numbing and arousal symptoms, as well as anger,
were predictive of family distress and secondary traumatiza-
tion. The arousal cluster of PTSD symptoms promoted anger
and hostility toward both spouses and children, and disrupted
marital and parental relationships (Wadsworth, 2010).
Combat exposure, PTSD symptoms, and aggressive behav-
ior have also been related to violence and hostility in the
families of veterans as well as increased aggression in their
children (Glenn et al., 2002). This research was conducted
with an older cohort of children of Vietnam veterans and
revealed a possible continuity of risk of behavioral problems
into adolescence and early adulthood.
Additional support for the negative effects of PTSD on
parenting comes from studies of spouses and partners of vet-
erans (Manguno-Mire et al., 2007) who were secondarily
traumatized by the service members' PTSD, and reported
negativeconsequencesforparentingbehaviors.Psychological
effects have also included secondary traumatization for chil-
dren (Rosenheck & Nathan, 1985) and higher risk of devel-
oping behavioral or psychiatric problems (Davidson, Smith,
& Kudler, 1989). One study compared Vietnam combat vet-
erans with and without PTSD, and found significantly more
behavioral problems among those children of veterans with
PTSD than among children of veterans without PTSD
(Jordan et al., 1992). More specifically, research from the
Veteran Center counselor survey (Matsakis, 1988) reported
that the most common problems among children of veterans
were low self-esteem, aggressiveness, developmental diffi-
culties, impaired social relationships, and symptoms charac-
teristic of secondary traumatization.
These findings suggest that PTSD symptoms in the
returned service member contribute to negative mental health
outcomes in their children; however, the link requires further
explanation. One possibility is the association between
PTSD and aggression (e.g., Taft et al., 2007). As there is evi-
dence that aggression in a parent predicts child outcomes
(Jouriles, Barling, & O'Leary, 1987; Margolin & Gordis,
2000), aggression could be a mediating factor explaining the
PTSD­child outcome link.
PTSD, General Aggression, and Child
Outcomes
Population-based cross-sectional studies of service members
have documented anger and aggression as frequently
reported problems for combat veterans returning from war in
Iraq and Afghanistan (Jakupcak et al., 2007; Killgore et al.,
2008; Thomas et al., 2010). Studies have also identified
aggressive behaviors as comorbid with PTSD (Forbes,
Foran et al. 3
Creamer, Hawthorne, Allen, & McHugh, 2003; Thomas
et al., 2010), and found that combat experiences such as
exposure to human trauma, combat violence, and killing pre-
dicted verbal and physical aggression toward others (Killgore
et al., 2008). Combat veterans with PTSD symptoms, but not
meeting full diagnostic criteria for PTSD, also reported sig-
nificantly higher aggressive behaviors when compared with
the non-PTSD group, thus increasing the potential magni-
tude of postcombat adjustment problems for service mem-
bers returning home to their families (Jakupcak et al., 2007).
Ameta-analysis examined the association between anger and
PTSD (Orth & Wieland, 2006). The authors found larger
effect sizes in samples with military war experiences com-
pared with samples exposed to other types of trauma, sug-
gesting that anger may be a more likely response for those
exposed to combat.
Although very little research has explored the link
between general aggression and child outcomes in families
of returning service members, findings from the civilian lit-
erature indicate that parental aggression is a risk factor for
child behavioral and emotional problems (Jouriles et al.,
1987; Margolin & Gordis, 2000). Notably, general aggres-
sion may affect the child even if it is not directed at the child
but at the spouse or other nonfamily members (Galovski &
Lyons, 2004; Glenn et al., 2002; Hurt, Malmud, Brodsky, &
Giannetta, 2001). A parent's display of anger/aggressiveness
may manifest in several ways that affect the child (e.g., ver-
bal outbursts, marital conflicts, angry facial expressions, and
other visible displays). Children who are exposed to angry
interactions between their parents may become more sensi-
tized to marital conflict and more vulnerable to its effects
(Faircloth, 2012). This, in turn, may lead to the child having
lower thresholds for exposure to aggression and experienc-
ing increased arousal, distress, and fear which can affect
their mental health. Anger and general aggression rather than
more covert symptoms of PTSD may be important in under-
standing the impacts on children and families. Thus, one
mechanism by which PTSD symptoms have an effect on a
child's mental health symptoms may be via increased aggres-
sion in the parent.
Marital Distress and Child Outcomes
From the civilian literature, there is substantial evidence
that parental marital distress and conflict can increase risk
of child mental health problems (Rhoades, 2008).
Consequently, the impact of marital distress on children in
military families is an important consideration as marital
problems have been reported as significant, negative out-
comes of combat deployment. An extensive review of
research on readjustment needs for service members and
theirfamilies(CommitteeontheAssessmentofReadjustment
Needs of Military Personnel, Veterans, and Their Families,
2013) identified several key studies documenting the impact
of deployment on marital and family quality. For example, a
population-based longitudinal study of service members
returning from Iraq andAfghanistan (Milliken,Auchterlonie,
& Hoge, 2007) found an increase in reported interpersonal
problems (including those with family members) from the
reintegration period up to 6 months later. Additional popula-
tion-based assessments of family and marital problems were
documented in the Army Gold Book Report (Department of
the Army, 2012) where 19% of spouses were reported to be
in counseling. Therefore, the consequences of marital dis-
tress and conflict should be considered in the assessment of
child outcomes to determine whether parental relationship
problems are the key mechanism affecting psychological
adjustment in children of returning service members.
Marital Distress, General Aggression,
and Child Outcomes
Marital distress is a robust predictor of anger and aggressive
behaviors, particularly directed at the spouse (Stith, Green,
Smith, &Ward, 2008; Stith, Rosen, McCollum, &Thompson,
2004). Marital conflict also has been identified as a strong
predictor of adults seeking mental health services and of
poor psychological adjustment for children, with severity of
aggression linked to marital functioning for the couple and to
depression, delinquency, aggression, and declines in psycho-
social functioning for children (Faircloth, 2012). Research
conducted with a nationally representative sample (Vissing,
Straus, Gelles, & Harrop, 1991) found that children who wit-
nessed verbally aggressive conflict between their parents had
higher rates of interpersonal problems, aggression, and
delinquency than other children. This finding suggests that
an atmosphere of anger and conflict in the family can lead to
mental health problems for children.
Marital distress also may increase risk of angry and
aggressive behaviors toward children and aggression in
general. As a result, chronic patterns of violence or an
atmosphere of anger and aggression in the home may affect
family relationships and the psychological adjustment of
family members. For example, anger in postcombat veter-
ans has been associated with family relationships marked
by distress and emotional conflict, with the veteran's anger
directed at a variety of targets and not necessarily at their
spouses and children (Galovski & Lyons, 2004). In a
review of family risk and resilience in the context of war,
Wadsworth (2010) reported that OIF/OEF veterans at post-
deployment felt uncertain of their family roles and believed
their family members were afraid of them, with many
describing conflicts involving shouting, pushing, and
shoving. Thus, not only abuse or aggression directed at the
spouse but also other types of aggressive or angry behav-
iors may increase in response to marital distress. Taken as
a whole, this literature suggests that parental aggression
represents one of the possible causal mechanisms linking
parental PTSD symptoms and marital distress to child
mental health problems.

Current Study
The current study examined the interrelationship between
parents' PTSD symptoms, general aggression, marital dis-
tress, and military children's mental health. While many
studies have focused on the civilian spouse during the sepa-
ration period, the current study examined the impact of the
active duty service member's symptoms following a com-
bat deployment on child mental health symptoms (hyperac-
tivity, conduct, and emotional problems). We hypothesized
that the service member's PTSD symptoms and marital dis-
tress would both predict child mental health symptoms.
However, we expected general aggression of the parent
would mediate the impact of PTSD symptoms and marital
distress in returning service members on child mental
health.
Method
Participants and Procedure
Active duty soldiers from a brigade combat team (N =
1,068) were invited to participate in the study 2 months
following return from a 15-month combat deployment to
Afghanistan. The study was approved by the local
Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was
obtained for all study participants, similar to other studies
with active duty soldiers (e.g., Wright, Foran, Wood,
Eckford, & McGurk, 2012). Surveys were administered to
large groups of soldiers and required approximately 1 hr to
complete. After being briefed on the purpose and proce-
dure of the study, 91% consented to participate (N = 974)
and were administered the anonymous paper-and-pencil
survey. Participants in the current study included only
those who reported having at least one child between the
ages of 3 and 17 living at home (n = 169; 17.3% of the full
sample). This rate is expected as this was a study of sol-
diers who served in a heavy combat deployment of which
half of the overall sample was below 24. Sample demo-
graphics are presented in Table 1.
Measures
Parental PTSD symptoms. The widely used 17-item Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL; Blanchard,
Jones-Alexander, Buckley, & Forneris, 1996) was used to
assess PTSD symptoms. This measure has been validated
with active duty military personnel (Bliese et al., 2008) and
shown to have high internal consistency (e.g., Cronbach's 
= .96, current sample). Participants rated symptoms in the
last month using a 5-point scale from 1 = not at all to 5 =
extremely. Possible scores range from 17 to 85 with scores
greater than 34 indicating a positive screen for PTSD symp-
toms among active duty military populations (Bliese et al.,
2008).
Child mental health symptoms.The Strengths and Diffi-
culties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997) was used to
assess child behavioral difficulties in children aged 3 to 17.
In addition to an overall score, the SDQ includes three sub-
scales that assessed emotional problems (five items), conduct
problems (five items), and hyperactivity/inattention (five
items) rated on a dichotomous scale (0 = symptom absent,
1 = symptom present). This measure has good psychometric
properties (Goodman, 2001; Tobia & Marzocchi, 2017), and
has previously been used to assess child mental health symp-
toms among military samples (Chandra et al., 2010). Partici-
pants reported on symptoms for up to six children; symptoms
scores were averaged across children. In addition, scores
were computed using responses for the child with the highest
scores reported within the family. Results were similar, so
only average scores will be presented. In the current sample,
the subscale alphas were .69 for hyperactivity/inattention,
.58 for conduct problems, and .64 for emotional problems.
These low to moderate alphas are not surprising, given that
each subscale consists only of five items that are relatively
broad in symptom content (Cortina, 1993). Cronbach's  for
the 15-item total scale was .77.
Marital distress. Marital distress was examined with three
dichotomous items: "Are you having marital problems?"
"Have you and your spouse gotten into frequent arguments
or disagreements?" and the reverse-scored item, "Is your
relationship strong?" This measure was developed based
on item response theory analysis of commonly used mari-
tal distress items in military samples (Bliese, Wright, Adler,

& Thomas, 2004; Ployhart, 2004). Items were rated on a
scale from 1 to 2, with higher scores indicating more marital
distress. These items have been used in other studies with
military samples (Foran, Wright, & Wood, 2013). Internal
consistency was .81.
General aggression.General aggression was assessed
with eight items developed by the Walter Reed Army Insti-
tute of Research based on longer anger and aggression
scales (Kulka et al., 1990; Spector & Jex, 1998; Spielberger,
1999) and used in previous studies with military populations
(Cabrera, Bliese, Hoge, Castro, & Messer, 2010; Wilk et al.,
2013). The items asked about angry feelings and aggressive
behaviors during the past month (e.g., "threaten someone
with physical violence," "get into a fight with someone and
hit the person," "get angry at someone and yell or shout at
them," "boil inside with anger," "feel like smashing some-
thing," "get angry with someone and kick or smash some-
thing," "slam the door," and "punch the wall"). The items
were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 = never to
5 = five or more times. The internal consistency of the scale
was .89. The aggressive behaviors may have been directed
at the spouse, child, or nonfamily member. The scale was
not meant to assess a specific type of aggression (i.e.,
spouse aggression) but rather aggression in general, which
is a common presenting problem among combat veterans
seeking mental health services (e.g., Taft et al., 2009). As
expected, this measure was significantly but not perfectly
correlated with a two-item measure of spouse aggression
(r = .56, p < .001).
Results
Sample Descriptives and Bivariate Correlations
Almost one third of the sample reported PTSD symptoms
above the cutoff of 34 or higher (31%). This high rate of
PTSD symptoms is expected, given that there was a high
level of combat exposure during the deployment. For exam-
ple, 64% of the sample reported being attacked or ambushed,
79% reported that an improvised explosive device (IED) or
booby trap exploding near them, and 51% reported a mem-
ber of their own unit was killed in action.
In terms of child mental health symptoms, 50.9% of par-
ticipants reported at least three hyperactivity symptoms for
one of their children, 11.8% reported at least three emotional
symptoms, and 9.3% reported at least three conduct symp-
toms. As shown in Table 2, parental PTSD symptoms, child
mental health, marital quality, and general aggression of the
parent were all significantly correlated as hypothesized.
Model of Parental PTSD Symptoms, Marital
Distress, and Child Mental Health
Structural equation modeling was used to test the multi-
variate model of parental PTSD symptoms, marital dis-
tress, and child mental health. Mplus 7.1 statistical
software was used to conduct the analyses (Mplus, 2010).
Model fit was evaluated with a variety of fit indices,
including comparative fit index (CFI) > .95, Tucker­
Lewis Index (TLI) > .95, root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA) < .08, and standardized root
mean square residuals (SRMR) < .08 (Browne & Cudeck,
1993; Hu & Bentler, 1999).
First, we tested a model in which PTSD symptoms and
marital distress predicted latent child mental health to deter-
mine whether they both accounted for unique variance in the
context of each other. Because child mental health symptoms
were strongly correlated, we analyzed them as a single latent
construct in the model, treating each dimension as a separate
indicator in the model. For latent child mental health, the fac-
tor variance was fixed to 1.0 and factor loadings were freely
estimated. Analyses were conducted with full-maximum-
likelihood estimation with robust statistics to adjust for
potential bias due to multivariate nonnormality (Asparouhov
& Muthén, 2005); notably, missing data on the various mea-
sures were minimal (<5%, n = 161-169). Parental PTSD
symptoms and marital distress were free to covary. Results
are presented in Figure 1. The model was a good fit to the

data: 2(4, N = 169) = 5.91, p = .21; CFI = .98; TLI = .95;
RMSEA = .05, SRMR = .03. Both parental PTSD symptoms
and marital distress uniquely predicted child mental health in
the context of each other, and the size of the association was
similar and of moderate magnitude; total variance accounted
for in child mental health symptoms was 21%.
To test our hypothesis that general aggression may be a
mediating factor that explains the association between parental
PTSD symptoms and child mental health and between marital
distress and child mental health, we tested a second model in
which aggression was a mediating variable. Maximum likeli-
hood with bootstrapped standard errors was used to test the
model (1,000 draws). The model was a good fit to the data: 2(6,
N = 169) = 10.59, p = .10; CFI = .98; TLI = .95; RMSEA= .07,
SRMR = .03. Results are presented in Figure 2. In Table 3,
unstandardized estimates and confidence intervals for each path
are reported.The direct paths from PTSD symptoms and marital
distress to child mental health were no longer significant once
parent general aggression was added to the model. Furthermore,
when the direct paths from PTSD symptoms and marital dis-
tress to child mental health symptoms were removed from the
model, 2(8, N = 169) = 13.56, p = .06; CFI = .97; TLI = .95;
RMSEA = .06, SRMR = .04, it did not significantly reduce
model fit,  2(2) = 2.97, p = .23. As shown in Table 3, the
indirect paths from both PTSD symptoms and marital distress to
child mental health via parent aggression were significant. The
model accounted for 28% of the variance in child mental health.
These results suggest that parental general aggression may be
one mechanism through which parental PTSD symptoms and
marital distress influence child outcomes.

Discussion
Results from the current study supported the two research
questions examining parental PTSD symptoms, general
aggression, marital distress, and mental health of their chil-
dren among active duty service members returning from a
combat deployment. For the first research question, the
study documented the association between parental PTSD
symptoms and child mental health symptoms during the
postdeployment reintegration period. This association was
significant even after accounting for marital distress (see
Table 2 and model depicted in Figure 1). For the second
research question, the study demonstrated that the impact
of PTSD symptoms on child mental health symptoms
among returning military personnel may be explained by
parental general aggression such that aggression mediated
the PTSD symptoms­child mental health outcomes (see
Figure 2).
This study extended the literature by focusing on the con-
ditions for children in the military family during postdeploy-
ment as the returning veteran transitions home from combat.
Combat-related trauma as expressed by PTSD symptoms,
and the anger and general aggression found to mediate PTSD
symptoms, may pose a significant problem for the psycho-
logical adjustment of children exposed to deployment transi-
tion challenges. The possibility of increased risk of negative
mental health outcomes for these children suggests the need
for early intervention, given the large numbers of veterans
returning from combat deployment and the numbers of their
children who may face exposure to reintegration adjustment
problems. Future studies are recommended to address how
the effects of combat trauma on family relationships can be
reduced, and how children can be better protected during the
adjustment period following return from deployment
(Wadsworth, 2010). Some recently planned intervention
projects designed to help military families through the
deployment process are promising (Gewirtz, Erbes, Polusny,
Forgatch, & DeGarmo, 2011) as they focus on intervention
strategies to support at-risk families by improving parenting
practices and child adjustment.
To build on the findings from the current study, research
should be conducted to further explore the connections
(pathways and mediating variables) between general aggres-
sion in the returning veteran and effects on their families.
The importance of such research is illustrated by studies con-
ducted with an older cohort of children of Vietnam veterans
(Glenn et al., 2002) that revealed a possible continuity of risk
of behavioral problems into adolescence and early adulthood
for those families exposed to violent and hostile interper-
sonal interactions, suggesting the potential for long-term
negative mental health outcomes.
There are some important limitations to our study that
need to be acknowledged and that raise interesting questions
for future research. Our sample was composed predomi-
nantly of fathers. The high proportion of men in the sample
is consistent with known characteristics of service members
with combat deployment experience who are mostly male.
Nevertheless, it is possible that our results might not gener-
alize to mothers, for whom the parent­child mental health
relationship may differ. For example, in the Morris, Gabert-
Quillen, and Delahanty, (2012) meta-analytic review of the
relationship between adult PTSD and child PTSD symp-
toms among civilian families exposed to trauma concluded
that this relationship was stronger for mothers than for
fathers. Thus, our findings might underestimate the effects
in a sample with greater proportions of mothers. The path-
ways linking PTSD and marital distress to child mental
health symptoms also could differ by gender, such that
aggression could be a more important factor for men than
for women. These possibilities highlight the need for contin-
ued attention to how sample characteristics affect study
findings in this research domain.
Another important issue concerns the fact that we only
gathered data from the deployed spouse and not from the
nondeployed spouse. Our study offers a unique perspective
on child mental health as studies typically only obtain infor-
mation from the nondeployed spouse. However, an assess-
ment from both parents would provide a more complete
picture of child outcomes. For example, the nondeployed
spouse would have greater opportunities to observe their
children's mental health symptoms, whereas the deployed
spouse may only hear about issues when they become prob-
lems. However, child mental health may be a more salient
concern to the nondeployed spouse, leading them to be more
aware of their children's symptoms and/or more affected by
them. Moreover, assessment of the nondeployed spouse to
determine patterns of coping, stress level, and psychological
symptoms during the deployment and following the service
member's return home would provide important information
to better address risk and protective factors from a family
systems perspective. These possible differences in reporting
patterns between service members and nondeployed spouses
raise several interesting questions for future research.
Furthermore, we assessed aggression broadly and did not
include a distinct measure of anger or types of aggression
(e.g., parent-to-child aggression, spouse aggression). There
is substantial literature that indicates anger as a risk factor for
aggressive behaviors (Anderson & Bushman, 2002), and
both anger and aggression are more frequently experienced
among combat-exposed veterans with PTSD symptoms
(Orth & Wieland, 2006; Taft et al., 2007). In addition, our
assessment of anger and aggression broadly maps onto treat-
ment strategies in which both are typically addressed together
(e.g.,angermanagementprogramsforveterans).Nonetheless,
there are also important differences between anger and sub-
types of aggression, and these should be evaluated further in
their relation to child mental health following deployments.
Another potential limitation concerns the cross-sectional
study design. One important issue is that there may be bidi-
rectional effects of adult and child mental health as well as
8 SAGE Open
marital distress and aggression. Both marital distress and
general aggression may have been elevated prior to deploy-
ment. This may have in turn increased the risk of PTSD
symptoms following return from deployment. We are, how-
ever, unable to demonstrate this in the current study, and can-
not conclude whether there are long-term effects on family
adjustment. Prospective, longitudinal studies with larger
samples are recommended that would provide data on preex-
isting child behavior concerns, marital distress, aggression,
and PTSD symptoms to identify either improvements or
exacerbation of problems over the course of the deployment
cycle.
Summary
A particular strength of the current study is that it included an
assessment of redeploying service members during a unique
time frame immediately following their 15-month combat
deployment with data collected from the perspective of the
returning service member. In addition, the study highlights
the importance of parental general aggression as a potential
mechanism of transmission of mental health symptoms from
parent to child. There is evidence of an association between
PTSD and general aggression in returning service members,
and the study now demonstrates that the impact extends to
child mental health outcomes. Future research should explore
the possible bidirectional effects of child outcomes on the
returning soldier and impacts on other family members from
a family systems perspective (Minuchin, 1985).
