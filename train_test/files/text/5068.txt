Introduction
Combinations of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers
(ARBs) and thiazide diuretics are recommended by vari-
ous guidelines for the treatment of high blood pressure.1,2
Most patients with hypertension require two or more drugs
to achieve their target blood pressure (BP).3 In fact, large-
scale clinical trials have shown that thiazide diuretics and/
or calcium channel blockers are frequently added to ARBs
to achieve adequate BP control.4 Nine kinds of single-pill
fixed-dose combinations of ARBs and diuretics are avail-
able for clinical use in Japan (Table 1). The combination of
high-dose telmisartan (80 mg/day) and hydrochlorothi-
azide (HCTZ, 12.5 mg/day) (Micombi®BP) has the strong-
est BP-lowering effect.5 We previously used a changeover
design in which the patients were switched from high-dose
ARBs or a combination of medium-dose losartan (50 mg/
day) and HCTZ to high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ.6
Although we found that high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ
induced a significant reduction of BP at three months after
changeover, the combination therapy resulted in a

Abstract
Objective: We analyzed the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of high-dose losartan (100 mg/day) and
hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 12.5 mg/day) compared with those of the combination of high-dose telmisartan (80 mg/
day) and HCTZ (12.5 mg/day).
Methods: Forty hypertensive patients who received a combination of high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ were enrolled.
We applied a changeover strategy with switching from a combination of high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ to high-
dose losartan and HCTZ. We divided the patients into two groups; those who achieved the target blood pressure
(controlled group) and those who did not reach the target blood pressure (uncontrolled group) before the changeover
and performed further analysis.
Results: The uncontrolled group showed a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (143±12 mmHg to
126±11 mmHg at three months). In addition, serum uric acid significantly decreased in all subjects, and in each of
the controlled and uncontrolled groups. There were no significant changes in other biochemical parameters, such as
potassium and hemoglobin A1c, at three months after the changeover in all subjects.
Conclusion: Combination therapy with high-dose losartan and HCTZ was superior to the combination of telmisartan
and HCTZ with respect to significant decreases in systolic blood pressure and serum uric acid in hypertensive patients.

significant increase in serum uric acid (UA). In particular,
an elevation of serum UA was observed in patients who
were switched from a combination of medium-dose losar-
tan and HCTZ to high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ.
It is still controversial whether a higher level of serum
UA is a risk factor for arteriosclerosis and coronary artery
disease.Although a relationship between serum UAand car-
diovascular events was not observed in the Framingham
study,7 such relationships have been demonstrated in some
studies.8,9 Moreover, in a subanalysis of data from the
Japanese CoronaryArtery Disease Study, a high level of UA
was shown to be an independent predictor of all events,
including cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.10 In
a prospective, randomized trial, allopurinol was shown to
decrease C-reactive protein and reduce cardiovascular and
hospitalization risk in patients with estimated GFR (eGFR)
<60 ml/min.11 AmongARBs, although both losartan and tel-
misartan significantly blocked urate transporter 1 (URAT1)
in in vitro experiments,12,13 only losartan showed uricosuric
action through the inhibition of URAT1 in humans.14
We hypothesized that a combination of high-dose losar-
tan and HCTZ could produce similar reduction in BP and
significant decrease in serum UA compared with a combi-
nation of high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ. Therefore, we
analyzed whether a changeover with switching from a
combination of high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ to high-
dose losartan (100 mg/day) and HCTZ would be more effi-
cacious and safe for hypertensive patients.
Methods
Study design
Forty hypertensive patients who received a combination of
high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ were enrolled. We
applied a changeover strategy with switching from
Micombi®BP (a single-pill fixed-dose combination of
telmisartan (80 mg/day) and HCTZ (12.5 mg/day)) to
Preminent® (a single-pill fixed-dose combination of
losartan (50 mg/day) and HCTZ (12.5 mg/day)) + losar-
tan (50 mg/day). Twenty-four patients (60%) received
Micombi®BP in the morning and the rest of patients (40%)
received it in the evening. After changeover, we did not
change the administration time in all patients.
We divided the patients into two groups: those who
achieved the target BP (controlled group) and those who
did not reach the target BP (uncontrolled group) before the
changeover, and performed further analysis according to
the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines 2009.1
We excluded patients with secondary hypertension, heart
failure of NYHA grade III or IV, moderate to severe liver
dysfunction (defined as aspartate aminotransferase and
alanine aminotransferase levels of more than three-fold the
normal ranges), renal dysfunction (defined as a serum cre-
atinine (Cr) level of more than 2.0 mg/dl), pregnancy, or a
history of allergy to losartan. The protocol in this study
was approved by the ethics committee of Fukuoka
University Hospital, and all subjects gave their informed
consent to participate.
Evaluation of clinical parameters
We analyzed seated office systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP
(DBP) and pulse rate (PR), body weight (BW), and blood
and urinary levels of biochemical parameters at baseline
and at three months after changeover. BP was determined
as the mean of two measurements obtained in an office
setting by the conventional cuff method using a mercury
sphygmomanometer after at least 5 min of rest. All of the
blood and urinary samples were collected in the morning
after the patients had fasted overnight. Data regarding
serum levels of biochemical parameters, such as high-
density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), UA,
Cr, eGFR, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), fasting blood
glucose (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), sodium (Na),
potassium (K), albumin (Alb), urinary (U)-UA, U-Cr, the
ratio of U-UA to U-Cr (U-UA/U-Cr), and the fractional
excretion of UA (FEUA, U-UA × serum Cr/serum UA ×
U-Cr) were collected in all patients. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2.
The characteristics of the patients, with regard to his-
tory of dyslipidemia (DL), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyper-
uricemia (HU), smoking status and medication use, were
obtained from medical records. Patients who had a current
SBP/DBP  140/90mmHg or who were receiving antihy-
pertensive therapy were considered to have hypertension.
Patients with LDL-C  140 mg/dl, TG  150 mg/dl and/or
HDL-C < 40 mg/dl, or who were receiving lipid-lowering
therapy were considered to have DL. DM was defined
using the American Diabetes Association criteria or the
use of a glucose-lowering drug. HU was defined as a

serum UA level of  7.0 mg/dl. Chronic kidney disease
(CKD) was defined as an eGFR level of < 60 ml/min per
1.73 m2.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the StatView sta-
tistical software package (StatView 5; SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA). Data are shown as the mean ± standard
deviation (SD). Categorical variables were compared
between groups by a chi-square analysis. The significance
of differences between mean values was evaluated by
paired and unpaired t-tests or one-way analysis of variance
followed by Fisher's protected-least-significant-difference
test, as appropriate.
Results
Patient characteristics
Table 2 shows the characteristics of the 40 patients, who
included nine (23%) males. No patients withdrew from the
study. The prevalence of DL, DM, HU and CKD was 63%,
13%, 35% and 40%, respectively. In addition, the percentage
use of calcium channel blocker (CCB), -blocker and
-blocker was 98%, 35% and 10%, respectively. There were
no significant differences in the baseline patient characteris-
tics between the controlled and uncontrolled groups. We did
not change these medications throughout the study period.
Changes in BP and PR
In all patients, SBP/DBP and PR at baseline were
126±17/69±11 mmHg and 69±9 beats/min, respectively
(Figure 1). SBP significantly decreased from 126±17
mmHg at baseline to 119±13 at three months after change-
over in all subjects. In particular, the uncontrolled group
showed a significant decrease in SBP (143±12 mmHg to
126±11 mmHg at three months). There were no significant
changes in DBP or PR during the study period.
Changes in biochemical parameters
As shown in Table 3, there were no significant changes in
biochemical parameters such as serum blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), Cr, K, HbA1c, BNP and lipid profile in all sub-
jects, or in the controlled and uncontrolled groups.
Changes in serum UA, U-UA/U-Cr and FEUA
in all subjects, and in the controlled and
uncontrolled groups
The combination of high-dose losartan and HTCZ signifi-
cantly decreased serum UA after three months in all sub-
jects, and in the controlled and uncontrolled groups (Figure
2), whereas there were no changes in U-UA/U-Cr or FEUA
in all subjects, or in the controlled and uncontrolled groups
(Table 3).
Changes in serum UA, K and HbA1c between
sub-groups
The normal UA, K and HbA1c values at our University
Hospital are 5.0­7.0 mg/dl, 3.5­5.0 mEq/l and 4.6­5.6%,
respectively. Therefore, we divided all of the patients into
two groups according to each normal range described as
previously.6 Our `relatively high UA group'was defined as

that at baseline, the average value was still within the nor-
mal range (K=4.3 mEq/l at three months). Moreover, there
were no significant changes after three months in either the
relatively low K group or the low and high HbA1c groups.
Discussion
In the present study, the combination of high-dose losartan
and HTCZ significantly reduced SBP and serum UA after
the switch from high-dose telmisartan and HTCZ.
Moreover, there were no serious adverse effects in any of
the patients.
High-dose losartan and HTCZ significantly reduced
SBP. BP control is the best strategy for achieving remark-
able clinical benefits with regard to cardiovascular and
renal protection. Since the change in SBP using high-
dose losartan and HTCZ was ­7 mmHg in all subjects,
SBP reduction should provide tremendous clinical

benefits. For example, a 2 mmHg reduction in SBP
should provide a 10% lower incidence of stroke mortal-
ity and about a 7% lower incidence of mortality from
coronary artery disease or other vascular causes in mid-
dle age.15
The synergistic effect of the combination of high-dose
losartan and HTCZ may be stronger than that with high-
dose telmisartan and HTCZ. In a previous study, 12.5
mg/day of HCTZ significantly increased plasma renin
activity (PRA).16 In this case, the blockade of the activa-
tion of PRA induced by HTCZ with high-dose losartan
may be stronger than that with high-dose telmisartan.
Since the combination of medium-dose losartan (50 mg/
day) and HTCZ had the same depressor effect as that of
medium-dose telmisartan (40 mg/day) and HCTZ,17 we
did not expect that a changeover from high-dose tel-
misartan and HTCZ to high-dose losartan and HTCZ
would be a useful strategy for inducing a more significant
reduction in SBP.
In this study, high-dose losartan and HTCZ signifi-
cantly decreased serum UA after a switch from high-dose
telmisartan and HCTZ. Losartan has been shown to have
uricosuric action via URAT1 in hypertensive patients.14
Hamada et al. reported that losartan and HCTZ increased
the ratio of UA clearance to creatinine clearance (CUA/
Ccr) in patients with a serum UA above 5.5 mg/dl,
whereas telmisartan and HCTZ significantly reduced
CUA/Ccr.17 Unexpectedly, U-UA/U-Cr and FEUA did
not change after the changeover to high-dose losartan and
HTCZ. The classification of HU into one of two types
(i.e. the overproduction of UA or a decrease in the uri-
nary excretion of UA) based on a 60-min spot urine or
24-h urine collection in outpatients is important for deter-
mining the treatment strategy,18 but there are no standard-
ized methods available. Thus, further studies will be
needed to resolve this issue.
Benson et al. indicated that telmisartan activated per-
oxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-, which
may improve insulin sensitivity,19 whereas losartan did not
activate PPAR-.20 Telmisartan may be useful in hyperten-
sive patients with insulin resistance or DM.21 Nonetheless,
in this study, the levels of HbA1c and FBS did not change
at three months after a changeover from high-dose tel-
misartan and HTCZ to high-dose losartan and HTCZ.
Telmisartan-induced activation of PPAR- may not be
clinically important in this study, and this result was con-
sistent with a previous report.22
Zillich et al. reported that the treatment of thiazide-
induced hypokalemia might reverse glucose intolerance.23
Although the level of K at three months after changeover
was significantly decreased in the relatively high K group,
the average value (K=4.3 mEq/l at three months) was still
within the normal range and was clinically ignorable.
Therefore, the level of K may not influence glucose
intolerance.
Study limitations
This study has three important limitations. First, the sam-
ple size is relatively small, which limits our ability to
determine significance. Second, we applied a changeover
with switching from high-dose telmisartan and HTCZ to
high-dose losartan and HTCZ. However, a crossover study
would be preferable. Third, we applied a changeover strat-
egy with switching from one tablet (Micombi®BP) to two
tablets (Preminent® + losartan). Twenty-four patients
received Micombi®BP in the morning and the rest of
patients received it in the evening before changeover,
whereas we did not change the administration time in all
patients after changeover. The numbers of tablets and
administration time may affect drug adherence and BP
lowering effects.
Conclusions
The combination of high-dose losartan and HTCZ signifi-
cantly reduced SBP and decreased serum UA after three
months. In addition, there were no serious adverse effects
in any of the patients.
