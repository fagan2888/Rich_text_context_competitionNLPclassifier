Individuals at Lower Risk for All-Cause
Mortality?

OBJECTIVE -- The clinical relevance of the metabolically normal but obese phenotype for
mortality risk is unclear. This study examines the risk for all-cause mortality in metabolically
normal and abnormal obese (MNOB and MAOB, respectively) individuals.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The sample included 6,011 men and women
from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) with public-access
mortality data linkage (follow-up  8.7  0.2 years; 292 deaths). Metabolically abnormal was defined as
insulin resistance (IR) or two or more metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) criteria (excluding waist).
RESULTS -- A total of 30% of obese subjects had IR, and 38.4% had two or more MetSyn factors,
whereas only 6.0% (or 1.6% of the whole population) were free from both IR and all MetSyn factors.
By MetSyn factors or IR alone, MNOB subjects (hazard ratio [HR]MetSyn
2.80 [1.18­6.65]; HRIR
2.58
[1.00­6.65]) and MAOB subjects (HRMetSyn
2.74 [1.46­5.15]; HRIR
3.09 [1.55­6.15]) had
similar elevations in mortality risk compared with metabolically normal, normal weight subjects.
CONCLUSIONS -- Although a rare phenotype, obesity, even in the absence of overt meta-
bolic aberrations, is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

subgroup of obese individuals who
are "metabolically normal" (MNOB)
despite increased adiposity (1­4). The in-
terpretation of some of these studies is that
MNOB subjects are not at increased risk for
morbidity and mortality and that obesity
treatment is therefore unnecessary. This is
in clear contrast with the current U.S. obe-
sity treatment guidelines that suggest that
obese individuals should be treated for their
obesity, regardless of their cardiovascular
(CVD) risk status (5).
The purpose of this study is to exam-
ine all-cause mortality risk in "metaboli-
cally normal obese" and "metabolically
abnormal obese" (MAOB) phenotypes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- A sample of 6,011
adults (age 18­65 years) from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey(NHANESIII)PublicAccessMortal-
ity Linkage was used. Age, sex, income, eth-
nicity, smoking status, exercise frequency,
dietary fat (30%), alcohol intake, inten-
tions to lose weight over the last year (yes/
no), and self-reported body weight 10 years
prior were assessed by questionnaire. BMI
cutoffs for normal weight (18.5­25 kg/m2),
overweight (25­29.9 kg/m2), and obese
(30 kg/m2) were used. To increase the
sample size (n  6,011 vs. 3,320), partici-
pants with fasting data (6 vs. 8 h) for at
least three of the four MetSyn criteria were
included.
Metabolic abnormalities were defined
as follows (6,7): 1) triglycerides 1.69
mmol/l or medications; 2) systolic blood
pressure 130 mmHg, diastolic blood
pressure 85 mmHg, or medications; 3)
glucose 5.6 mmol/l or medications; 4)
HDL cholesterol 1.04 mmol/l for men
and 1.29 mmol/l for women; and 5) ho-
meostasis model assessment (HOMA)
2.5 (n  4,602).
Metabolically normal was defined us-
ing three separate definitions: 1) insulin
sensitive by HOMA; 2) one or fewer
MetSyn criteria; or 3) absence of all
MetSyn criteria and IR.
Statistical analysis
Cox regression was used to assess risk for
all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, sex,
income, smoking status, ethnicity, and al-
cohol. Because of small cell sizes, mortal-
ity analyses were limited to metabolically
normal definitions 1 and 2. Analyses were
performed using SAS version 9.1 or SUD-
DAN 10.0, weighted to be representative
of the U.S. population.
RESULTS -- Within the sample, 25.6%
of participants were free from all MetSyn
factors and IR, wherein MNOB repre-
sented 1.3% of the population and 6.0%
of the obese. The proportion of obese who
were MNOB by IR alone (30.2%) or had
1 MetSyn factor (38.4%) was consider-
ably higher than those with no MetSyn
factors (9.4%).
During the 8.7  0.2 year follow-up,
there were 292 (5%) deaths. As defined
by MetSyn factors, MNOB (hazard ratio
[HR] 2.80 [1.18­6.65]) and MAOB (HR
2.74 [1.46­5.15]) were associated with
increased mortality risk compared with
MNNW (referent) (Figure 1). All IR BMI
categories and MNOB were associated
with increased mortality risk (MNOB:
HR 2.58 [1.00 ­ 6.65]; metabolically
abnormal normal weight: HR 2.26
[1.19 ­ 4.42]; metabolically abnormal
overweight: HR 2.44 [1.34 ­ 4.42];
MAOB: HR 3.09 [1.55­6.15]).
Regardless of definition, MAOB sub-
jects had a higher BMI and waist than
MNOB subjects (P  0.05) but reported
similar dietary fat, alcohol consumption,
and weight loss intentions (P  0.10). Ex-
ercise frequency was significantly lower
in IR obese but not by MetSyn factors.
MAOB subjects by MetSyn factors, but
not IR, were older (7.5 years) and heavier
(7.7 kg) 10 years ago.
CONCLUSIONS -- This analysis
suggests that a truly metabolically normal
obese individual is a rare phenotype, ac-

Moreover, obese individuals are at higher
risk of mortality than their nonobese
counterparts, regardless of whether they
present with insulin resistance or a clus-
tering of metabolic risk factors.
Previous studies report MNOB sub-
jects to be 11­40% of obese subjects
(1,3), whereas we report MNOB subjects
to be 6.0­38.4% of obese subjects de-
pending on the definition. We used a
more stringent definition with lower clin-
ical cutoffs and a HOMA cutoff of 2.5 that
is associated with clamp-measured IR (7)
as opposed to an arbitrary 90th percentile
cutoff of 5.13. Despite our stricter defini-
tion, the true prevalence of MNOB may in
fact be lower than the 6.0% that we re-
port, since individuals in negative energy
balance typically display metabolic pro-
files that are better than expected for their
level of obesity (8). Because over two-
thirds of obese individuals are attempting
to lose weight (9), some MNOB subjects
may be in negative energy balance. Nev-
ertheless, reported intentions to lose
weight were not different between MNOB
and MAOB subjects.
The name "metabolically normal" im-
plies MNOB subjects are not at an ele-
vated health risk. For example, Brochu et
al. (1) identified a subgroup of MNOB
postmenopausal women who were insu-
lin sensitive and questioned the medical
urgency to treat these women as they were
"metabolically normal." The notion that
some obese individuals may not require
obesity treatment is in contrast to current
U.S. obesity treatment algorithms (5) that
recommend overweight individuals with
two or more CVD risk factors and all
obese individuals regardless of their risk
profile should be treated. The algorithm de-
fines CVD risk using nonmetabolic (age,
smoking, and personal/family CVD history)
and metabolic (LDL, HDL, hypertension,
and glucose) factors. Although important,
manyofthenonmetabolicCVDfactorscan-
not be altered. Thus, examination of modi-
fiable metabolic factors may be more
clinically relevant and useful.
That MAOB subjects were older and
more obese currently and 10 years prior
may imply that MNOB subjects have not
had sufficiently high levels of obesity, or
adequate time for metabolic abnormali-
ties to develop as a consequence of their
obesity (10). Alternatively, increased
mortality risk could be mediated through
both metabolic and nonmetabolic conse-
quences. Obese individuals are more
likely to die from traumatic incidences
(11) and have cancer diagnosed at more
advanced stages than their normal weight
counterparts (12). Further, weight bias by
some health professionals results in
greater reluctance to provide health
care--a problem that is compounded by
the fact that obese individuals are more
likely to avoid seeking health care (13).
Regardless of the reasons why MNOB and
MAOB subjects are at similarly elevated
mortality risk, these findings reinforce the
importance of obesity reduction in all
obese individuals.
In summary, obesity in the absence of
metabolic abnormalities is a rare condi-
tion. Further, obesity is associated with an
increased risk for all-cause mortality, re-
gardless of whether the obese patients
present with insulin resistance or a clus-
tering of metabolic risk factors. As such,
weight management should continue to
be a target for reducing morbidity and
mortality in all obese individuals.
