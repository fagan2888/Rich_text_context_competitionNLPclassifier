Few studies have focused on the relationship between the trajectories of long-term changes in body mass index
(BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) and all-cause mortality in old age, particularly in non-Western populations. We eval-
uated this association by applying group-based mixture models to data derived from the National Survey of the Jap-
anese Elderly, which included 4,869 adults aged 60 or more years, with up to 7 repeated observations between
1987 and 2006. Four distinct BMI trajectories were identified: "low-normal weight, decreasing" (baseline BMI = 18.7;
23.8% of sample); "mid-normal weight, decreasing" (baseline BMI = 21.9; 44.6% of sample); "high-normal weight,
decreasing" (baseline BMI = 24.8; 26.5% of sample); and "overweight, stable" (baseline BMI = 28.7; 5.2% of sam-
ple). Survival analysis with an average follow-up of 13.8 years showed that trajectories of higher BMI were associ-
ated with lower mortality. In particular, relative to those with a mid-normal weight, decreasing BMI trajectory, those
with an overweight, stable BMI trajectory had the lowest mortality, and those with a low-normal, decreasing BMI
trajectory had the highest mortality. In sharp contrast with prior observations from Western populations, BMI
changes lie primarily within the normal-weight range, and virtually no older Japanese are obese. The association
between BMI trajectories and mortality varies according to the distribution of BMI within the population.

Weight change is known as an important predictor of mor-
tality risk. Although several studies have generally concluded
that, in adulthood, weight loss is associated with an increased
risk of all-cause mortality relative to stable weight, findings
on the relationship between weight gain and mortality have
been mixed (1­10). These observations apply to older popu-
lations as well (1, 4, 11­15). Furthermore, in older adults,
weight changes have been shown to predict mortality better
than a single weight assessment (15).
Although prior studies of weight changes and mortality
yield important insights, the classification of weight change
could be significantly improved in 2 respects. First, weight
changes in the past have been defined largely on the basis of
body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) measured at
2 points in time over a relatively short interval. Because body
weight can fluctuate substantially over the adult life course
(16­18), weight changes measured at multiple time points over
an extended period of time (e.g., 5­10 or more years) may
provide additional important information. Second, prior re-
search has commonly categorized trajectories of change in
BMI by using assignment rules that are based on subjective
criteria (e.g., 5% gain or loss from baseline body weight). Al-
though such assignment rules are generally reasonable, they
are limited because the existence of certain categories of weight
changes must be assumed a priori.Thus, the analysis cannot test
empirically for their presence, which constitutes a fundamental
shortcoming. In addition, ex-ante specified rules provide no
basis for calibrating the precision of individual classifications
to the various groups that comprise these categories. Therefore,
the uncertaintyabout an individual's group membership cannot
be quantified in the form of probabilities (19).
To date, there have been only 2 studies exploring the rela-
tionship between BMI trajectories and mortality, both of
which were based on data from the Health and Retirement

Study for older Americans aged 51­61 years at baseline (20,
21). However, the extent to which their conclusions can be
generalized to other populations remains to be evaluated.
Many non-Western societies differ significantly from the
Unites States in the distribution of body weight. For instance,
inJapan,3.9%oftheadultpopulationareobese(BMI:30.0),
and 20.8% are overweight (BMI: 25.0­29.9), while the prev-
alence of underweight (BMI: <18.5) is 8.2%, and the pre-
valence of normal weight (BMI: 18.5­24.9) is 67.1% (22).
In contrast, 27.7% and 34.9% of the US population are, re-
spectively, obese and overweight, and 1.7% and 35.6% are
underweight and normal weight (23). These differences are
consistent in old-age groups (refer to detailed statistics in
Web Table 1, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). More-
over, a World Health Organization Expert Consultation (24)
concluded that the current World Health Organization cutoff
points do not provide an adequate basis for taking action on
risks related to overweight and obesity in Asian populations.
This suggests the need to apply different thresholds for defin-
ing overweight and obesity in these populations. Therefore,
understanding whether the trajectories of body weight changes
in older Japanese and their relationships with mortality are
similar or different from those observed in Western popula-
tions can carry valuable clinical and public health implications.
The present study has 2 specific aims. First, we apply group-
based mixture models to identify distinct trajectories of BMI in
Japanese adults, aged 60 years or more at baseline. Second, we
examine the relationship between the trajectories of BMI and
all-cause mortality. Our goal is to determine whether the tra-
jectories of body weight changes in older Japanese and their
relationships with mortality are similar to or different from
those observed in Western populations.
METHODS
Study population
Data came from the National Survey of the Japanese El-
derly, which is a 7-wave longitudinal data set that included
4,869 Japanese adults aged 60 years or more, with 16,669 ob-
servations during the period from 1987 to 2006 (an average
of 3.42 observations per participant). This survey began with
2,200 respondents aged 60 years or more in 1987 (wave 1).
The sample was subsequently supplemented in 1990 (wave 2;
n = 580) and 1996 (wave 4; n = 1,210). An additional sample
of those 70 years of age or more was added in 1999 (wave 5;
n = 2,000) (for detailed information on the number of partic-
ipants at each wave, refer to Web Table 2). Face-to-face in-
terviews were used to collect data. Responses obtained from
proxy interviews were excluded. Response rates for each wave
of the survey ranged from 67% to 93%. This study was ap-
proved by the Institutional Review Board of the Tokyo Metro-
politan Institute of Gerontologyand the Universityof Michigan.
Mortality and follow-up
Follow-ups for all-cause mortality were conducted until
December 31, 2012. Participants' dropout from the study or
dates of death were collected by reviewing residence certifi-
cates with the permission of local municipalities where the
participants lived. For people whose date of death (year,
month, and day) could not be ascertained (n = 35), a date
was imputed as the midpoint between the respondent's
last interview and the next wave. If only month or day of
death could not be obtained (n = 363), a date was imputed
as the midpoint of the year or the month of death. Conse-
quently, 54.0% (n = 2,628) died during the follow-up pe-
riod. Those who had refused the interview survey were
treated as censored (6.0%; n = 291). A total follow-up pe-
riod was 25 years (13.8 years of average follow-up per
participant).
Measures
Height and weight were self-reported at each wave (waves
1­7), and BMI was calculated from these self-reported values
according to accepted formula as specified above. Age, sex,
marital status, current working status, education, annual
household income, health behaviors, and health status at
baseline were incorporated as covariates in the present study.
Health behaviors included the number of cigarettes smoked
per day, the number of drinking days per month, and fre-
quency of exercise.
Health status was measured by chronic diseases, self-
rated health, and functional status. The number of physician-
diagnosed chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease,
stroke, lung disease, liver disease, and kidney disease, was
reported by the respondents. Self-rated poor health was mea-
sured by a 3-item composite with a score ranging from 3 to 15
(Cronbach's  = 0.84); a high score indicates poor health. Fi-
nally, functional status entailed a sum of difficulties with 6
activities of daily living (ADLs) (i.e., dressing, walking,
bathing or showering, eating, getting in or out of bed, and
using the toilet) and 5 instrumental ADLs (i.e., grocery shop-
ping, phone calls, climbing stairs, walking a few blocks, and
traveling by bus or train). All items were scored by either a 4-
or 5-point scale. With appropriate adjustment, scores for this
composite ranged from 11.5 to 55 (Cronbach's  = 0.92); a
high score reflects greater functional disability. The measure
for ADLs in 1987 (wave 1) consisted of only1 item (i.e., bath-
ing or showering), whereas ADLs were measured by 6 items
at the subsequent waves (1990­2006; waves 2­7). To ho-
mogenize the 1-item ADL measure collected in 1987 with
the 6-item ADLs measure taken after 1987, we imputed the
values of the 6-item ADLs measure for those who had only
1-item ADL available in 1987 (n = 2,200). This is justified in
view of the fact that the 1-item ADL measure is highly cor-
related with the 6-item ADLs measure (r = 0.92).
Statistical analysis
We used group-based mixture models with maximum like-
lihood estimation to identify distinct trajectories of changes
in BMI (25). As recommended, the best-fitting model (i.e.,
the number of distinct trajectories) was chosen on the basis
of Bayesian Information Criterion scores and an examination
of 95% confidence intervals (19). We estimated models with
2­5 trajectories by assuming linear, quadratic, and cubic pat-
terns of change in BMI over time, using the SAS PROC
TRAJprogram(SASInstitute,Inc.,Cary,NorthCarolina).We

selected the best-fitting model by comparing the Bayesian In-
formation Criterion indices associated with various solutions
and the average posterior probabilities of group membership,
and by evaluating whether successive models identified addi-
tional distinct groups as indicated by nonoverlapping confi-
dence intervals.
In this study, the time from baseline was used as the time
scalebecausedifferentbirthcohortswereobservedatdifferent
ages; thus, cohort and age effects were highly confounded.
Moreover, the time-based approach seems to best capture our

interest in describing distinct patterns of change in BMI
over time among Japanese older adults from different birth
cohorts.
In a subsequent step, indicators of trajectory membership
were included as predictors of mortality in a Cox proportional
hazard model in order to calculate the relative mortality riskof
each trajectory. To control for possible effects of precipitated
weight loss prior to death on baseline BMI, we undertook ad-
ditional analyses excluding people whose death occurred
within a year from baseline. Furthermore, to rule out the con-
founding effects of smoking, physical activity, and chronic
diseases on BMI and mortality, we conducted parallel analy-
ses of selected subgroups: noncurrent smokers, physically ac-
tive individuals, and those without a history of cardiovascular
disease, stroke, lung disease, liverdisease, and kidney disease.
The results were expressed as hazard ratios with 95% confi-
dence intervals. The analyses were performed by using the
SAS PROC PHREG program (SAS Institute, Inc.).
Initial descriptive analysis of the individual variables in
this study indicated that, with the exception of household in-
come with 35.3% missing data, the proportion of cases with
missing data on the remaining items ranged from 0% to 8.6%.
Although PROC TRAJ assumes a missing-at-random mecha-
nism, this is not the case for the Cox regression analysis. With-
out imputation, it may lead to a serious loss of cases in the Cox
regression analysis. To minimize the potential bias associated
with item nonresponse, we used multiple imputation for miss-
ing data (26), by using an inclusive strategy with not only var-
iables included in our analytical models but also auxiliary
variables not included in our analysis (27). Examples of aux-
iliary variables included social support, depressive symptoms,
and follow-up measures of the predictors in the Cox regression
analysis, which were measured at baseline. In particular, 3
complete data sets were imputed with NORM freeware (avail-
able from Springer International Publishing AG, Cham, Swit-
zerkand), and analyses were run on each of these 3 data sets
with parameter estimates derived by averaging across 3 impu-
tations and by adjusting for their variance. The imputation pro-
cedure was performed for surviving participants temporally by
removing participants after death. Both group-based mixture
models and the Cox proportional hazard model were con-
ducted by using the imputed data sets.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the sample descriptive characteristics at
baseline. Mean age was 69.9 years, and 55.3% were female.
Mean BMI was 22.3, with 10.7% underweight, 71.4% in the
normal range, 16.4% overweight, and 1.4% obese.
Figure 1 illustrates the BMI trajectories derived from
group-based mixture models, whereas Table 2 shows the in-
tercept and linear slope of each trajectory. As the patterns of
the trajectories from each imputed data set were similar, we
show the trajectory patterns from only 1 of the 3 imputed data
sets on Figure 1. In particular, 4 distinct trajectories were iden-
tified: "low-normal weight, decreasing" (baseline BMI =
18.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 18.6, 18.9; 23.8% of
sample); "mid-normal weight, decreasing" (baseline BMI =
21.9, 95% CI: 21.8, 22.0; 44.6% of sample); "high-normal
weight, decreasing" (baseline BMI = 24.8, 95% CI: 24.7,
25.0; 26.5% of sample); and "overweight, stable" (baseline
BMI = 28.7, 95% CI: 28.5, 28.9; 5.2% of sample). This model

was identified as the best-fitting model based on the Bayesian
Information Criterion, which revealed an improved model fit
from 2 to 4 trajectories, with little improvement beyond 4
trajectories. In addition, the model with 4 trajectories had a
better fit than that with 5 trajectories.
We also estimated a series of trajectories by assuming qua-
dratic and cubic patterns of change in BMI over time. Com-
paring the fit indices of the different estimated models, we
concluded that the 4 linear trajectories provided the optimal
fit to the data. Although the quadratic functions of these tra-
jectories were statistically significant, the quadratic coefficients
for the 3 declining trajectories were very small. Moreover, the
BayesianInformationCriterionindexforthequadraticmodels
was almost identical to that for the linear models (-38,250.12
vs. -38,253.28). Thus, we chose the linear models in pre-
senting our results. For reference, the quadratic pattern of
BMI trajectories for the 4-group model is provided as Web
Figure 1.
As there is a debate regarding the relative merits of random
imputation of missing values, particularly those of the depen-
dent variable, we undertook PROC TRAJ by using the imputed
data as well as the nonimputed data (refer to Web Table 3
(estimations of growth curve parameters) and Web Figure 2
(illustration of BMI trajectories)). Because the results based
on the imputed data and nonimputed data were quite similar,
we have chosen to present the results based on the imputed
data.
Table 3 presents the baseline characteristics of the 4 trajec-
tory subgroups. The subgroup following the "low-normal
weight, decreasing" trajectory had the highest mean age among
the 4 subgroups; approximately 70% in the "overweight, sta-
ble" subgroup and roughly 50% in the "mid-normal weight,
decreasing" subgroup were female.
Table 4 shows the mortality hazard ratios for each BMI tra-
jectory subgroup, with the "mid-normal weight, decreasing"
trajectory subgroup as reference. In model 1, after adjusting
for sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, health
status at baseline, and entry wave, the "low-normal weight,
decreasing" subgroup had a significantly higher mortality
risk compared with the "mid-normal weight, decreasing"
subgroup (hazard ratio = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.33). On the
other hand, the "high-normal weight, decreasing" (hazard
ratio = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.93) and "overweight, stable"
(hazard ratio = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.96) subgroups had sig-
nificantly lower risks of death. Excluding events occurring
within 1 year from baseline produced no change in the asso-
ciations described in model 1 (model 2a). In the subgroup
analyses of noncurrent smokers and physically active indi-
viduals (models 2b and 2c), the associations of "low-normal
weight, decreasing" and "overweight, stable" with mortality
were attenuated and became nonsignificant among noncur-
rent smokers, while the linkage between "low-normal weight,
decreasing" and mortality became more pronounced among
physically active individuals. Finally, the analysis of those

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first studyevaluating
the heterogeneity of BMI trajectories and its relationship with
old age mortality in an Asian population. In particular, we
found 4 distinct BMI trajectories over a period of 19 years
among older Japanese. Three of them had a baseline BMI with-
in a normal range (i.e., low-, mid-, and high-normal weight)
that decreased over time. The fourth trajectory started at a
level of overweight and remained unchanged over time. Our
research provides new evidence that the trajectories of BMI
and their linkages with mortality differ between Western
and Asian populations.
The findings are quite striking in view of earlier observa-
tions on BMI trajectories in middle and old age based on US
data (20, 21, 28­30). Specifically, among middle-aged and
older Americans, trajectories of overweight and obesity often
account for 70%­80% of the sample, whereas a little over 5%
of older Japanese in our analysis were identified as following
a stable overweight trajectory. Furthermore, among older
Japanese, BMI changes primarily lie within the normal-
weight range (i.e., BMI: 18.5­25.0), although approximately
24% of older Japanese followed a trajectory of "low-normal
weight, decreasing" that started with a BMI of 18.7 and de-
creased to 17.8 over 19 years. Therefore, older Japanese dif-
fer from older Americans not only in terms of the weight
distribution at a single point in time but also in the patterns
of weight changes over time. Of the 4 BMI trajectories iden-
tified among older Japanese, those characterized by higher
body-weight levels were associated with lower mortality.
The "low-normal weight, decreasing" subgroup had the high-
est mortality risk, followed by the "mid-normal weight, de-
creasing," the "high-normal weight, decreasing," and the
"overweight, stable" subgroups. This is consistent with prior
observations showing that weight loss in underweight indi-
viduals is associated with an increased mortality risk than in
normal-weight or overweight/obese individuals (1, 9, 14).
Decreasing body weight is often accompanied by an accumu-
lation of muscle or bone loss (31, 32). This might represent a
reduced ability to maintain energy balance, which shares
many immunological and neuroendocrine features of disease-
associated wasting syndromes (33).
Over the period of our observation, changes in BMI were
relatively small, and these trajectories were relatively parallel.
In contrast to the general population, older populations tend
to have a reverse J-shaped or L-shaped association of BMI
with all-cause mortality (34­36), which was also found in
Japanese studies (37­39). These studies report that under-
weight is an important predictor of mortality, while overweight
has the lowest mortality risk in old age. This has been referred
to as the "obesity paradox" (40). This might be due to energy
and nutritional reserves, as malnutrition is known to be a pre-
dictor of all-cause mortality (41, 42). Thin people with less
energy and nutritional reserves are less resistant to infection
(43). In fact, thinness is associated with a higher risk of
respiratory disease than is normal weight among older Japa-
nese (38). In addition, there is some evidence that stable over-
weight is associated with a low risk of death (1, 8, 10). Extra
body weight may provide protection against nutritional and
energy deficiencies and the loss of muscle and bone.
Therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude that the sub-
group with low-normal but decreasing weight had the highest
mortality risk, while the subgroup with stable overweight had
the lowest mortality risk among the 4 trajectory subgroups.
There have been only 2 US studies to date examining the link-
ages between BMI trajectories and mortality in old age (20,
21), both of which suggested that those who were overweight
but stable had the highest survival rate. This is consistent with
our findings from this Japanese population. More importantly,
according to our results, even a small or moderate weight loss
among those with a normal BMI may have a deleterious effect
on health. Hence, both BMI at baseline and its changes over
time are important in predicting the risk of death. Accordingly,
for older Japanese, a greater clinical and public health empha-
sis should be placed on preventing weight loss, rather than on
combating overweight and obesity.
Among noncurrent smokers in model 2b, the association
between BMI trajectories and mortality became nonsignifi-
cant. This suggests an effect modification of smoking on the
association. Smoking is known to be associated with a lower
BMI trajectory in old age (44) and to reduce life expectancy (45).
Our findings revealed that the association between BMI trajec-
tories and mortality existed among noncurrent smokers only.
A major strength of this research lies in its longitudinal
data derived from a national probability sample of older Jap-
anese over a 19-year period. Many previous studies used an a
priori categorization of the levels and changes in BMI and ex-
amined its relationship with mortality. We applied a person-
centered approach (19), which provided a strong empirical
support to identify distinct BMI trajectories in older Japanese
and to assess differences in mortality risk between these tra-
jectories. Our research yields important new information re-
garding the trajectories of BMI among older Japanese and
how they are associated with mortality, and it suggests that
priorities for weight control in old age may well differ be-
tween Japan and the United States.
The present study has several limitations. First, BMI was
calculated from self-reported measures of height and weight.
As people tend to overreport their height and underreport
their weight (46­48) and heavier people tend to underreport
their weight more than thinner people (46), the BMI may have
been underestimated, particularly among overweight individ-
uals. This could bias the estimated pattern of BMI trajectories.
Meanwhile, as there is a possibility that people underestimate
their current weight due to the factors related to mortality
(e.g., chronic disease progression), the findings of this study
should be carefully interpreted. Second, our approach to model
change in BMI by time since baseline in group-based mixture
models fails to distinguish between age effects and period
effects (49). Although we understand the pitfalls of this ap-
proach, the alternative age-based approach fails to distinguish
between age effects and cohort effects (49). We favored the
time-based approach because it seems to best capture our in-
terest in describing distinct patterns of change in BMI over
time among Japanese older adults that could then be used

to predict mortality. Moreover, in the mortality analysis, we
adjusted for baseline age and entry wave. Third, we did not
distinguish between intentional and unintentional weight
changes. Several studies have reported that, for equivalent
amounts of weight loss, unintentional loss was associated
with a higher mortality risk compared with intentional loss
(50­52). By differentiating between these 2 types of weight
change, we believe that a better understanding of the factors
underlying the association between BMI trajectories and
mortality may emerge. Nonetheless, we adjusted for base-
line health status that may partially account for unintentional
weight loss. Fourth, there is the possibility that diseases other
than the 5 diseases we adjusted for in the analysis confound
the association between body weight and mortality. History
of cancer is a possible confounding factor but was not in-
cluded in the calculation of the health status variable because
this question was not included in wave 1. This was because,
in the 1980s Japanese culture, physicians were often reluctant
to inform a patient of a diagnosis of cancer (53). We under-
took a sensitivity analysis by running the same survival anal-
yses, including an imputed variable of history of cancer in the
model, and obtained results similar to those reported in this
study.
In conclusion, this research provides new insights concern-
ing the complex dynamic linkages between BMI and mortality
in old age in Japan. In contrast with prior observations made in
Western populations, our research identified a downward tra-
jectory at the border between normal weight and underweight
subgroups, which characterized a significant proportion of
older Japanese (i.e., the "low-normal weight, decreasing" sub-
group). This trajectory was associated with the highest risk of
mortality among the 4 trajectories identified in this study. At
the same time, we found a trajectory of stable overweight that
characterized a small proportion of older Japanese who had the
lowest risk of death, which is similar to the results described
earlier in Western populations (20, 21). Our research suggests
that, in later life, a trajectory of low and declining BMI poses a
significant risk for survival; this finding could inform clinical
and public health approaches to body-weight management
aimed to improve the health and survival of older adults, par-
ticularly in Asian populations.
