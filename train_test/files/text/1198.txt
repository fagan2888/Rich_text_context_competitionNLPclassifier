Introduction
Once assumed to be a disorder of childhood, attention defi-
cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been shown to persist
into adulthood and affects over 9 million Americans (1). As
in children, core features of adult ADHD include 
inattention,
impulsivity, distractibility, and/or hyperactivity (2). Adults
with ADHD commonly report procrastination, boredom
intolerance, 
frustration intolerance, disorganization, affect
dysregulation, and heightened emotional reactivity (3).
Adults with ADHD also have elevated rates of arrest histo-
ries, poor 
academic performance, depression, anxiety, traffic
accidents, occupational problems, tobacco use, and substance
abuse (4). Less research has explored health problems associ-
ated with ADHD.
Obesity affects 31% of the US population (5) and certain
mental disorders predict greater risk for obesity-related

disease. Mental disorders characterized by appetite and/or
affect dysregulation such as binge eating disorder (BED) (6)
and depression (7) have been the primary targets of study.
However, a few studies have revealed rates of ADHD in
weight treatment-
seeking adults 5­15 times higher than rates
in population samples (8­11). Whether ADHD is linked to
increased risk for obesity in the general adult population has
not yet been explored.
ADHD may be linked to obesity in children. One study found
19.5% of 5­14-year-old boys diagnosed with ADHD had BMIs
90th percentile and 7.2% had BMIs 97th 
percentile (11),
nearly twice as high as the general population in that age range.
Consistent findings were reported in a study of children aged
8­17 years who were hospitalized for obesity. Over half (57.7%)
met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD (8). A study of children aged
3­18 years with ADHD, 29% were at risk for overweight (BMI
>85th percentile) and 17.3% for obesity (BMI >95th percen-
tile) (12), which is two and three times higher than the 
general
population, respectively. Finally, a population-based study
revealed that among 1,429 Chinese students aged 13­17 years,
those with ADHD symptomatology were 1.4 times as likely to
be obese than lean (13).

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral disorder that affects ~2.9­4.7% of US adults.
Studies have revealed high rates of ADHD (26­61%) in patients seeking weight loss treatment suggesting an
association between ADHD and obesity. The objective of the present study was to test the association between
ADHD and overweight and obesity in the US population. Cross-sectional data from the Collaborative Psychiatric
Epidemiology Surveys were used. Participants were 6,735 US residents (63.9% white; 51.6% female) aged 18­44
years. A retrospective assessment of childhood ADHD and a self-report assessment of adult ADHD were administered.
Diagnosis was defined by three categories: never met diagnostic criteria, met full childhood criteria with no current
symptoms, and met full childhood criteria with current symptoms. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was
33.9 and 29.4%, respectively, among adults with ADHD, and 28.8 and 21.6%, respectively, among persons with no
history of ADHD. Adult ADHD was associated with greater likelihood of overweight, (odds ratio (OR) = 1.58; 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 1.05, 2.38) and obesity (OR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.14, 2.64). Results were similar when adjusting
for demographic characteristics and depression. Mediation analyses suggest that binge eating disorder (BED), but not
depression, partially mediates the associations between ADHD and both overweight and obesity. Results suggest that
adult ADHD is associated with overweight and obesity.

Two studies explored the relationship between ADHD and
obesity in adults. One study of obese patients seeking weight
loss treatment revealed 27.4% met diagnostic criteria for
ADHD, a rate six times greater than what has been reported
in the general population (9). Patients with ADHD also had
significantly higher BMIs and lost significantly less weight
during weight loss treatment than those without ADHD.
Similar findings were reported in a study of 75 severely obese
women referred for weight loss treatment. About 27% reported
symptoms of ADHD in both childhood and adulthood (10).
Findings from these clinic-based studies suggest an associa-
tion between adult ADHD and obesity. Population studies are
needed because rates of psychiatric disorders are typically
inflated in clinic samples. Also, the extent to which depression
and BED account for the relationship between ADHD and
obesity should be explored given that each is independently
associated with obesity (14,15) and ADHD (1,16). The purpose
of the present study was to examine the association between
ADHD and risk for overweight and obesity, and the degree to
which the association is accounted for by depression and BED
among adults sampled from the general US population.
Methods And Procedures
The Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Studies (CPES),

sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health, include three
nationally 
representative surveys of US adults. These surveys were
designed to provide epidemiologic data regarding mental 
disorders
using standardized diagnostic criteria. The three surveys include the
National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), the National
Study of American Life (NSAL), and the National Latino and Asian
American Study of Mental Health (17). Although independent
surveys, the CPES were designed to allow combining of the three
datasets by having shared scientific objectives, measurement tools,
implementation procedures, and sampling methodologies (18).
The core CPES questionnaire was based on the World Health
Organization's expanded version of the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview. The present study included only the NCS-R
and the NSAL because the National Latino and Asian American
Study of Mental Health did not assess ADHD.
The NCS-R was a cross-sectional survey designed to provide repre-
sentative data of the noninstitutionalized population of English-speaking
US adults aged 18 years between 2001 and 2003 (19). The NCS-R used
a four-stage probability sampling method, first sampling Metropolitan
Statistical Areas and counties, then area segments, followed by housing
units within the area segments, and finally eligible respondents within
the housing units (18,19). The recruitment method included a mailed
introductory letter and study brochure followed by a household visit
by a trained interviewer to identify eligible respondents and provide
informed consent. The survey consisted of face-to-face computer-assisted
personal interviews. The interview included two parts. Part 1 included
the core diagnostic assessment of all 9,282 persons participating in the
study (response rate 70.9%). Part 2 was administered to a subset of 5,692
respondents, including all who met lifetime diagnosis of a disorder and
a probability sample of all other respondents. Part 2 included questions
related to disorders of secondary interest. Diagnostic questions for
ADHD were included in Part 2, and were asked only of persons aged
18­44 years (n = 3,197) (1).
The NSAL was a cross-sectional survey conducted between 2001
and 2003 that targeted English-speaking US adults who self-identified
as African American (n = 3,570), of Caribbean descent (n = 1,621)
and non-Hispanic whites living in predominantly black neighbor-
hoods (n = 891). A sampling method similar to that of the NCS-R
was used (18,20). Interviewers made household visits to obtain

consent and complete the computer-assisted personal interview. The

majority of CAPIs (86%) were completed face-to-face and the remain-
ing by phone. The response rate was 71.5%. The entire sample (n =
6,082) completed all components of the computer-assisted personal

interview. Analyses were restricted to respondents aged 18­44 years
(n = 3,538) to be consistent with the NCS-R. Analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.1.2 and Stata version 10.
The analytic sample for this study included 6,735 respondents aged
18­44-years old, 3,197 from the NCS-R and 3,538 from the NSAL. In
the NCS-R, only a randomly selected sub-sample completed questions
related to eating disorders, of whom 1,672 were 18­44-years old. Thus,
analyses including the BED variable were conducted only among 5,210
respondents, 1,672 from the NCS-R and 3,538 from the NSAL. Because
data were missing at random, imputation methods for missing data were
not performed. This study was approved by the University of Massachu-
setts Medical School Institutional Review Board.
Measures
Respondents self-reported their height and weight as part of the core
interview. BMI was calculated using the standard formula (weight
in kilograms/height in meters squared). BMI was included in the
CPES as a recoded six category variable: underweight (BMI 18.4);
normal weight (BMI 18.5­24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0­29.9), class
I obesity (BMI 30.0­34.9), class II obesity (BMI 35.0­39.9), and class
III 
obesity (BMI 40.0). For the purposes of the present study, we
recorded BMI into a three category variable: normal/underweight,
overweight, and obese.
As described elsewhere (1), childhood ADHD was assessed using a ret-
rospective version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (21).
Respondents who reported six or more symptoms of inattention or hyper-
activity were administered follow-up questions regarding the remaining
DSM-IV criteria. If a respondent met criteria for childhood ADHD, they
were then asked whether problems persisted to the present. Clinical reap-
praisal interviews were performed by clinical interviewers on a subsample
of participants using the Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale (22,23),
the ADHD Rating Scale (24), and an adaptation of the ADHD Rating
Scale. Respondents were diagnosed with adult ADHD if they endorsed
six or more symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity within the
last six months (DSM-IV Criterion A), two or more Criterion A symp-
toms before age seven (Criterion B), impairment in two or more areas of
living within the past 6 months (Criterion C), and clinically significant
impairment in at least one of these areas (Criterion D). No attempt was
made to operationalize DSM-IV diagnostic hierarchy rules (Criterion E).
Inter-rater reliability for diagnosis was 0.78. The clinical reappraisal sub-
sample was weighted to be representative of the US population in the age
range of the sample (18­44 years). A detailed description of the clini-
cal reappraisal procedures is reported elsewhere (1,19). We grouped the
ADHD diagnoses into three mutually exclusive categories: never met
diagnostic criteria, met full childhood criteria with no current symp-
toms (childhood ADHD), and met full childhood criteria with current
symptoms (adult ADHD).
Major depressive disorder was diagnosed using the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview. Diagnoses were based on DSM-IV criteria.
Two non-overlapping probability samples were selected, one to com-
plete a clinical reappraisal interview to evaluate lifetime diagnoses, and a

second to complete a clinical reappraisal interview to evaluate 12-month
diagnoses. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (25) was used
for clinical reappraisal. Respondents were classified using three mutu-
ally exclusive categories: lifetime (meeting criteria for a major depressive
disorder at some point during their life), past 12 months (meeting criteria
at some point in the past year), or never having met criteria.
The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was also used to
assign diagnosis of BED; however, although DSM-IV requires binges
to persist for 6 months, the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview required only 3 months. In the present study, respond-
ents were classified into three categories: (i) lifetime, meeting cri-
teria for BED at some point during their life; (ii) past 12 months,

meeting criteria at some point in the past year; or (iii) never having
met criteria.
Respondents were asked to bring in medication bottles for all

medications and medication status was recorded. Because use of

stimulants and antidepressants could potentially influence the results,
the presence/absence of each medication type was dummy coded and
entered as covariates in the analyses. Antidepressants were coded in two
ways: those with a weight gain side effect and all others. Demographic
factors assessed included age, gender, race/ethnicity and education level,
and smoking status.
Statistical analysis
Distributions of BMI categories according to major depressive dis-
order, BED, and ADHD status were compared using 2 statistics.
Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the odds of
overweight and obesity compared to normal BMI among persons
with childhood ADHD and adult ADHD compared to those with
no ADHD. A crude model was computed followed by a multivari-
ate model adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and

smoking status. To explore the possible impact of major depressive
disorder and BED on the association between ADHD and BMI,
mediation models were conducted via methods developed by Baron
and Kenny (26). Accordingly, mediation may be present if the fol-
lowing four criteria are met: (i) the independent variable (ADHD) is
associated with the outcome (BMI), (ii) the independent variable is
associated with the hypothesized mediator (major depressive disorder
and BED), (iii) the mediator is associated with the outcome, control-
ling for the independent variable, and (iv) the association between
the independent variable and the outcome variable becomes attenu-
ated or not statistically different from zero when controlling for the
mediator. Mediation models were derived separately for BED and
major depressive disorder. Each model controlled for demographic
factors and smoking status. Although originally proposed for longitu-
dinal designs, mediational methods (26) may also be valid for cross-

sectional data, although inferences of causality are limited (27).
The CPES dataset included respondent sampling probability weights to
allow inference to the general US population of 18­44 years. The weights
took into consideration the multi-stage sampling methods used in each
study and the over-sampling of Part I NCS-R respondents for Part II
of the questionnaire. Weights for individual datasets and combinations
of datasets were included. The analyses use weights for the combined
NCS-R Part II and NSAL dataset.
Results
Sample description
The mean age of the sample was 31-years old (s.e. = 0.25),
with 51.6% female (Table 1). The majority (63.9%) were non-
Hispanic white, with 16.1% Hispanic, 12.7% non-Hispanic
black and 7.4% Asian or other race, reflecting the population
weighting of the data. Greater than half (54.1%) had attained
education beyond high school. Nearly one-third (29.2%) were
smokers.
Prevalence of DSM-IV diagnoses
Prevalence of childhood and adult ADHD was 7.3 and 3.6%,
respectively. Among individuals with ADHD in childhood
only, 47.3% were inattentive type, 26.0% were hyperactive type,
and 26.7% were combined type. Among individuals with adult
ADHD, 35.4% were inattentive type, 26.3% were hyperactive
type, and 38.3% were combined type. Major depressive dis-
order past year prevalence was 8.4% with lifetime prevalence
of 17.9%. BED prevalence past year prevalence was 2.0% with
lifetime prevalence of 4.9%.
BMI distribution
Almost half (48.9%) had BMI 24.9 (underweight/normal),
29.2% had BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 (overweight), and 21.9%
had BMI 30.0 (obese) (Table 2). Obesity was more prevalent
among persons with adult ADHD (29.4%) than among those
with a history of childhood ADHD but no adult symptoms
(23.7%) and those with no history of ADHD (21.6%) (P <
0.006). Prevalence of obesity (BMI 30.0) was higher among
persons with a diagnosis of BED in the past 12 months (44.6%)
than among those with lifetime diagnosis (26.4%) and those
with no history of BED (21.7%) (P = 0.02).
Multinomial logistic regression models
In the crude multinomial logistic regression (model 1), adult
ADHD was associated with statistically significant increases
in the odds of being overweight (odds ratio (OR) = 1.58; 95%

The criteria for step 1 of the mediation analyses for both past
year major depressive disorder and BED were met, because
adult ADHD was positively associated with both overweight
and obesity. Lifetime variables (as opposed to past year) were
not associated, and were thus not tested for mediation. Adult

ADHD was significantly associated with past year major
depressive disorder (OR = 2.97; 95% CI = 1.56, 5.65) (criteria 2,
see Table 4). Criteria for step 3 was also met, major depressive
disorder in the past year was independently associated with
obesity (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.85). Step 4 criteria was not
met. Adult ADHD remained associated with overweight (OR =
1.57; 95% CI = 0.99, 2.70) and obesity (OR = 1.69; 95% CI =
1.01, 2.82) when controlling for major depressive disorder.
Adult ADHD was significantly associated with past year
BED (OR = 5.1; 95% CI = 2.83, 10.72) (step 2, see Table 4).
Adults with ADHD had rates of past year BED (10.2%) that
were sixfold that of adults with no history of ADHD (1.7%).
Controlling for ADHD, past year BED was associated with
obesity (OR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.21, 6.92), but not with over-
weight (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 0.62, 3.82). The association
between adult ADHD and obesity was no longer statistically
significant when controlling for BED in the past 12 months
(1.41, 95% CI = 0.76, 2.53).
Discussion
This is the first population-based study to examine the asso-
ciation between ADHD and obesity in adults. Results revealed
that having adult ADHD increased the odds of being over-
weight and obese. Among individuals with adult ADHD, 33.9%
were overweight and 29.4% were obese, compared to 28.8 and
21.6% respectively, of individuals with no history of ADHD.
Past year or lifetime history of major depression did not affect
these associations; however, past year BED mediated the asso-
ciations between ADHD and both overweight and obesity.
Findings might suggest mechanistic overlap between ADHD
and obesity, which has been alluded to elsewhere (28,29).
One possible neurobiological mechanism is that both ADHD
and obesity are linked to hypo-dopaminergic function in the
brain (30). In ADHD, hypo-dopaminergic function influ-
ences the prefrontal cortex, which is important for sustaining
and dividing attention as well as inhibiting distraction (31).
Dopamine is also central to appetite regulation. Risk 
taking,
substance abuse, and eating pathology have been 
associated
with DRD2 receptor dysfunction (32). Both ADHD and
obesity have been characterized by deficiencies in the DRD2
receptors (28,32). Davis et al. (29) have suggested that because
palatable energy-dense foods are known to activate dopamine
pathways, overeating among individuals with ADHD may
be an attempt at self-medication. Self-medicating behavior in
ADHD including alcohol and other substance abuse has been
well-documented (33­35).
ADHD symptoms might have implications for weight

regulation. ADHD has been characterized as a problem of
behavioral disinhibition affecting memory, motivation, and
self-regulation of affect (36). As a result, an individual with
ADHD might fail to plan meals ahead of time, frequently
skip meals due to distractions, and/or lose sight of intentions
to moderate food intake. Difficulties with sustaining complex
behaviors have been seen in persons with ADHD and are most
notable when there is no immediate gratification involved (37).
Weight regulation is exceedingly difficult, requiring a great
deal of behavioral inhibition in light of the current obesogenic
environment (29), and would seem especially challenging for
individuals with ADHD.
A diagnosis of BED in the previous year mediated the rela-
tionship between adult ADHD and obesity. Adults with ADHD
have difficulty regulating their emotions, and such 
difficulties
may lead to eating reactively in response to unpleasant moods.
Findings are also consistent with a study that revealed that
ADHD symptoms were associated with eating in response to
negative moods and environmental cues, as well as binge eating
(29). Dysregulated eating could be a potential pathway between
ADHD and obesity. The present study is the first population-
based study revealing a comorbidity between ADHD and BED.
The present study has several limitations. Height and weight
were assessed via self-report, leading to underreporting due
to social desirability biases (38). Features of ADHD such as
impulsivity and distractibility might result in less frequent self-
weighing and therefore less accurate self-reports in those with
ADHD. Infrequent self-weighing could lead to underestimated
self-reports because weight tends to increase over time. Both
potential sources of misclassification would bias the associa-
tion between ADHD and obesity toward the null. Also, BMI
was only available as a categorical variable in the CPES dataset.
There are limitations to the diagnostic measure of adult ADHD
as discussed elsewhere (1) including reliance on DSM-IV cri-
teria for ADHD which were developed for children, and that
direct evaluation was performed on a reappraisal subsample
with imputations performed for the remaining cases. However,
no standard clinical evaluation of adult ADHD currently exists.
Another limitation is that although we test the mediating
effect of depression and BED, causality cannot be 
established
in cross-sectional studies. Despite the large total sample size,
the prevalence of conditions under study was low making it
difficult to assess interactions of major depressive disorder
and BED on the association between ADHD and BMI or the

influence of ADHD subtypes on risk for obesity.
Results suggest that ADHD is linked to both obesity and
BED in the US adult population. The presence of ADHD
in overweight and obese patients has clinical implications,
including difficulty with behavioral weight management skills
such as self-monitoring, meal planning, and adhering to nutri-
tion and physical activity goals. Given that BED mediated the

association between ADHD and obesity, dysregulated eating
patterns among adults with obesity and ADHD should be
studied further.
