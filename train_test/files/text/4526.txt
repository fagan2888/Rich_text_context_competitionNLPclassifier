Abstract
This study investigates the role of the intracellular adenosine transporter equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (ENT3) in
stimulated release of the gliotransmitter adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from astrocytes. Within the past 20 years, our
understanding of the importance of astrocytic handling of adenosine, its phosphorylation to ATP, and release of astrocytic
ATP as an important transmitter has become greatly expanded. A recent demonstration that the mainly intracellular nucleo-
side transporter ENT3 shows much higher expression in freshly isolated astrocytes than in a corresponding neuronal
preparation leads to the suggestion that it was important for the synthesis of gliotransmitter ATP from adenosine. This
would be consistent with a previously noted delay in transmitter release of ATP in astrocytes but not in neurons. The present
study has confirmed and quantitated stimulated ATP release in response to glutamate, adenosine, or an elevated Kþ con-
centration from well-differentiated astrocyte cultures, measured by a luciferin­luciferase reaction. It showed that the
stimulated ATP release was abolished by downregulation of ENT3 with small interfering RNA (siRNA), regardless of the
stimulus. The concept that transmitter ATP in mature astrocytes is synthesized directly from adenosine prior to release is
supported by the postnatal development of the expression of the vesicular transporter SLC17A9 in astrocytes. In neurons,
this transporter carries ATP into synaptic vesicles, but in astrocytes, its expression is pronounced only in immature cells and
shows a rapid decline during the first 3 postnatal weeks so that it has almost disappeared at the end of the third week in well-
differentiated astrocytes, where its role has probably been taken over by ENT3.

Introduction
A multitude of authors have shown Ca2þ-dependent
release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from astrocytes
as recently refereed by ourselves (Hertz et al., 2014). It
was also mentioned that the release of ATP from cultured
astrocytes triggered by receptor stimulation or Ca2þ
uncaging occurs after a delay, with approximately only
4% of the release occurring during the first 30 s
(Pryazhnikov & Khiroug, 2008), and that the time inter-
val is even longer in brain slices (Heinrich, Ando
´ , Tu
´ ri,
Ro
´ zsa, & Sperla
´ gh, 2012). Pangrsic et al. (2007) similarly
noticed a longer poststimulatory delay for the release of
ATP from astrocytes than from neurons.

The released ATP must have been synthesized in the
astrocytes, which cannot accumulate ATP from their sur-
roundings. Adenosine is present in the extracellular space
and can be accumulated through an equilibrative nucleo-
side transporter (ENT) or concentrative (CNT) nucleo-
side transporter (Li, Gu, Hertz, & Peng, 2013; Parkinson
et al., 2011). In cultured astrocytes (but not neurons), it is
predominantly metabolized to adenosine monophosphate
(AMP) by adenosine kinase, and further via adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) to ATP (Matz & Hertz, 1989). In
adult brain, adenosine kinase is also almost selectively
localized in astrocytes (Studer et al., 2006), with one of
its two splice variant, the short form, in the cytosol
(Boison, 2013). We have recently shown in cells freshly
obtained from the mouse brain that mRNA for the
mainly intracellular nucleoside transporter equilibrative
nucleoside transporter 3 (ENT3; Baldwin et al., 2005),
determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), is greatly enriched in astrocytes
when compared with neurons. ENT3 gene expression
has also previously been identified in freshly isolated
astrocytes by microarray techniques (Cahoy et al., 2008;
Doyle et al., 2008), and we have demonstrated its expres-
sion in cultured astrocytes by RT-PCR (Li et al., 2013).
These observations lead to the suggestion that it might
carry adenosine to vesicles involved in the synthesis of
transmitter ATP, which in that case would be synthesized
locally (Li et al., 2013). To obtain further information
whether this might be the case, we have in the present
study compared glutamate, adenosine, and Kþ effects on
astrocyte cultures with downregulated ENT3 due to small
interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment with those in ENT-
expressing astrocytes that had been treated with the other
reagents needed for downregulation with siRNA, but
without the ENT3 siRNA itself and were regarded as
normal controls. In normal astrocyte cultures, each of
these stimuli cause a large increase in ATP release
(Xu et al., 2014). Furthermore, as the vesicular trans-
porter SLC17A9 which transports ATP itself into neur-
onal synaptic vesicles (Larsson et al., 2012) has
been demonstrated in cultured astrocytes of unknown
age and differentiation (Oya et al., 2013), we have
examined the postnatal development of the expression
of this transporter in our well-differentiated astrocyte
cultures.
Materials and Methods
Reagents
Chemicals for the preparation of medium and most other
chemicals, including adenosine (9 -b-D-ribofuranosylade-
nine), glutamate (L-2-aminopentanedioic acid), and the
ecto-ATPase inhibitor, ARL67156 (6 -N,N-diethyl-D-
beta-gamma-dibromomethylene ATP), were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates were obtained from
TaKaRa Biotechnology (Dalian, China). Opti-MEMI
and Oligofectamine used for preparation of cells with
downregulated ENT3 due to treatment with siRNA
against this transporter were purchased from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA, USA). Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) supplied ENT3 siRNA: sc-60588. The
ENLITEN ATP Assay System Bioluminescence
Detection Kit was purchased from Promega (Madison,
WI, USA). Primers for ENT3, SLC17A, and TATA box-
binding protein (TBP) were synthesized by Sangon Co.,
Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Cell Culture
Primary cultures of astrocytes were prepared from the
neopallia of the cerebral hemispheres as previously
described (Juurlink & Hertz, 1992) with minor modifica-
tions (Xu et al., 2013) and planted in 24-well plates in
Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM) with
7.5 mM glucose (to allow some decline between feedings),
the 5.4 mM Kþ traditionally used in our cultures, and
20% serum, which was gradually reduced to 10% after
the age of 1 week during the culturing period. After the
age of 2 weeks, 0.25 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP
(dBcAMP) was included in the medium. Such cultures
are highly enriched in astrocytes (>95% purity of glial
fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and glutamine synthe-
tase-expressing astrocytes (Hertz, Juurlink, & Szuchet,
1985). The addition of dBcAMP at this specific stage of
culturing is a crucial component of our culture prepar-
ation. Thus, expression of many astrocytic genes known
to exist in adult astrocytes in the brain, for example,
aralar (Lovatt et al., 2007), shows a large increase after
it has been added to the culturing medium (Li, Hertz, &
Peng, 2012).
Treatment With ENT3 siRNA
To allow incorporation of siRNAs into astrocytes,
3-week-old astrocyte cultures were incubated in
Dulbecco's medium without serum for 24 hr on the day
before transfection. Transfection solution contained 2 ml
of Oligofectamine, 40 ml of Opti-MEMI, and 2.5 ml of
siRNA (666 ng) and was added to the cultures for
8 hr. Cultures treated in this manner are indicated as
siRNA(þ). To control for possible effects of
Oligofectamine or Opti-MEMI, they were compared
with siRNA(À) control cultures, which had been treated
with transfection solution in a similar manner, but with-
out siRNA addition. After this treatment, 87.5 ml of
DMEM with 37.5 ml of serum was added to the cultures.
The expression of mRNA of ENT3 was measured by RT-
PCR 3 days after transfection.

Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction
For the determination of mRNA expression of ENT3 and
SLC17A9 by RT-PCR of their mRNA expression, a cell
suspension was prepared by discarding the culture
medium, adding Trizol to cultures on ice and scraping
the cells off the culture dish. In our hands, the classical
RT-PCR gives similar results as real-time RT-PCR, and
the results are more directly visible (Peng et al., 2013). The
RNA pellet was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol,
washed with 75% ethyl alcohol, and dissolved in 10 ml
sterile, distilled water, and an aliquot was used for deter-
mination of the amount of RNA. One microgram of RNA
extract was used for RT, which was initiated by 5-min
incubation at 65C of RNA extract with Random
Hexamer at a final concentration of 12.5 ng/l and deoxyr-
ibonucleotide triphosphates at a final concentration of
0.5 mM. The mixture was rapidly chilled on ice and briefly
spun, and 4 ml of 5 Â First-Strand Buffer, 2 ml of 0.1 M
dithiothreitol, and 1 ml of RNaseOUT Recombinant
RNase Inhibitor (40 U/ml) were added. After the mixture
had been incubated at 42C for 2 min, 1 ml (200 U) of
Superscript II was added, and the incubation at 42C con-
tinued for another 50 min. Subsequently, the reaction was
inactivated by heating to 70C for 15 min, and the mixture
was chilled and briefly centrifuged.
PCR amplification was performed in a Robocycler
thermocycler with 5 mg of complementary DNA, 0.2 mM
of sense or antisense nucleotides, and 0.375 U of Taq poly-
merase (TaKaRa Biotechnology). The forward primer for
ENT3 was 50ATAGCAGCGTTTACGGCCTCAC30 and
its reverse primer was 50TCACTGGATGCTGCCA
GGTC30 (Nakagawa et al., 2008). The forward primer
for SLC17A9 was 50AGGTCATCTTGCTGTCAGCC30
and its reverse primer was 50AAGGATCTCTCGCT
CTCCTG30 (Oya et al., 2013). TBP was used as house-
keeping gene, and its forward and reverse primers, respect-
ively, were CCACGGACAACTGCGTTGAT and CGC
TCATAGCTACTGAACTG (El Marjou, Montalescot,
Buzyn, & Geny, 2000). Initially, the template was dena-
tured by heating to 94C for 2 min, followed by 35 ampli-
fication cycles for ENT3 and SLC17A9, and 40 for TBP.
Each cycle consisted of three periods, the first for 45 s at
94C; the second for 45 s at 59.2C for ENT3, 59.8C for
SLC17A9, and 58C for TBP; and the third for 90 s at
72C. The final step was extension for 10 min at 72C.
The PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel
electrophoresis and captured by FluorChem 5500 (Alpha
Innotech, San Leandro, CA, USA). Ratios between
scanned ENT3 mRNA or SLC17A9 and TBP were deter-
mined and averaged.
Luciferin­Luciferase ATP Assay
For the determination of the extracellular ATP, a luci-
ferin­luciferase assay (ENLITEN ATP Assay System
Bioluminescence Detection Kit, Promega) and a
TECAN infinite M200 Microplate Analyzer (Lausanne,
Switzerland) were used to record relative light units
(RLU) as described by Liu, Sabirov, and Okada (2008).
As previously described (Xu et al., 2014), the assay was
performed during 60 min in DMEM without serum or pH
indicator at 37C. The ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL67156
was present in all experiments. Then, the medium was
rapidly cooled to room temperature for the ATP assay
and mixed with a 100 -ml aliquot of luciferin­luciferase
reagent dissolved in dilution buffer provided with the
assay kit, and chemiluminescence values (RLU) were rec-
orded as an indication of ATP content. Even in the
absence of any known ATP, considerable relative high
RLU readings were caused by the medium or tissue.
This appeared larger than the previously measured
1,200­1,600 RLU under control conditions (Xu et al.,
2014), perhaps reflecting some effects of the reagents
other than siRNA itself with which the cells had been
treated.
Statistics
The statistical values of the differences between individual
groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
followed by Fisher's least significant difference test. The
level of significance was set at p < .05.
Results
Figure 1(a) shows blots of two experiments in which
mRNA for the ENT3 gene was determined together
with mRNA for TATA-box protein, used as a house-
keeping gene. In both experiments, the determination
was made (a) in cultures that had undergone the whole
procedure required for ENT3 downregulation by siRNA
3 days earlier [siRNA(þ)] and (b) in cultures that had
been exposed to the drugs used in association with
siRNA treatment (Opti-MEMI and Oligofectamine) but
not the siRNA itself [siRNA(À)]. The figure shows a mas-
sive ENT3 downregulation in siRNA(þ) cultures but not
in the cultures where the siRNA was omitted during the
treatment. TBP is only slightly affected (siRNA(À) cul-
tures). Figure 1(b) shows the scanned ratios between
ENT3 and TBP mRNA expression and confirms the
very considerable downregulation of the ENT3 gene by
the siRNA treatment.
The ENT3 downregulation did not affect ATP release
under control conditions (Figure 2), but it abolished the
response to glutamate (Figure 2(A)), adenosine
(Figure 2(B)), and 45 mM Kþ (Figure 2(C)). The control
values in these cultures, where even the controls had been
treated with the other chemicals used during the siRNA
treatment, seemed larger than previously determined (Xu
et al., 2014), either reflecting larger unstimulated release
Song et al. 3
or a higher blank value, and the stimulatory effects were
perhaps smaller. However, the conclusion that only the
cultures that had not received siRNA responded to stimu-
lation is not affected by these possible changes.
A rapid developmental decrease in the expression of
mRNA of the vesicular ATP transporter SLC17A9 which
in neurons transports ATP into synaptic vesicle is shown
in Figure 3. In very immature astrocytes, its expression is
pronounced, but in well-differentiated astrocytes, it has
almost disappeared at the time the adenosine kinase is
known to have shifted its expression from neurons to
astrocytes (Studer et al., 2006).
Discussion
The previous demonstration of the much more pro-
nounced expression of ENT3, the only mainly intracellu-
lar nucleoside transporter (Baldwin et al., 2005), in
astrocytes than in neurons (Li et al., 2013), leads to the
hypothesis that the astrocytic release of transmitter ATP
may originate from a vesicular ATP pool generated in
situ from adenosine. This concept is supported by the
present finding that downregulation of ENT3 abolishes
stimulated release of ATP. In contrast, neuronal trans-
mitter release of ATP is dependent upon an intracellular
ATP transporter (Larsson et al., 2012). A similar trans-
porter has recently been demonstrated in cultured astro-
cytes of unknown age and in C-6 cells, an astrocytic
tumor cell line (Oya et al., 2013). However, it was asso-
ciated only with lysosomes and not with other intracellu-
lar organelles containing ATP. Moreover, the age and
differentiation of the astrocytic cultures are important
as reflected by the virtual disappearance of the expression
of this transporter in 3-week-old well-differentiated cul-
tures shown in Figure 3. Another relevant example of
differences in poorly and well-differentiated astrocyte cul-
tures is the high rate of adenosine phosphorylation
reported by Matz and Hertz (1989) in cultures similar
to those used in the present study, but not by
Parkinson, Ferguson, Zamzow, and Xiong (2006) in pre-
sumably less differentiated cultures. It may, however,
appear against the present conclusion of adenosine trans-
port into vesicles and intravesicular formation of ATP
that Coco et al. (2003) in an article on astrocytes reported
that bafilomycin A1
(an inhibitor of vacuolar type Hþ-
ATPase [V-ATPase] involved in vesicular uptake)
impaired ATP storage and release, but it should be

noted that this part of their experiments was carried out
using chromaffin cells, not cultured astrocytes. That
mature astrocytes, in contrast to both neurons and chro-
maffin cells, are unable to use ATP imported by
SLC17A9 for stimulated release is in support of their
use of ENT3 for uptake of adenosine which is subse-
quently converted to ATP in the vesicles. This is also
consistent with the lag time between stimulation and
actual release found by both Pangrsic et al. (2007) and
Pryazhnikov and Khiroug (2008).
Summary
Glutamate, adenosine, or high Kþ stimulation of release
of gliotransmitter ATP is abolished by downregulation of
adenosine transporter ENT3, probably due to the inhib-
ition of adenosine uptake in vesicles.
