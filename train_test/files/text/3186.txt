Abstract
This paper studies optimal monetary policy responses in an economy featur-
ing sectorial heterogeneity in the frequency of price adjustments. It shows that a
central bank facing heterogeneous nominal rigidities is more likely to behave less
aggressively than in a fully sticky economy. Hence, the supposedly excessive cau-
tion in the conduct of monetary policy shown by central banks could be partly
explained by the existence of a relevant sectorial dispersion in the frequency of
price adjustments.

Non technical summary
Sectorial heterogeneity in price setting is a well established fact. Among others, Bils and
Klenow (2004) and Dhyne et al. (2004) investigate the issue of the frequency of price adjustments
for CPI data in several sectors of the United States and the euro area. While, on average, about 15%
of prices in the euro area and 25% in the United States are adjusted each month, dispersion across
sectors is most relevant. In the euro area and the United States, energy and unprocessed food prices
display the highest frequency of price adjustment, while service prices are the stickiest.
Another fairly well established fact is the puzzling "caution" that central banks, and the
Federal Reserve in particular, seem to adopt in the conduct of monetary policy. Rudebusch and
Sevnsson (1999), for example, estimate a small-scale model of the United States economy and,
assuming a commonly accepted loss function for the central bank, show that the optimal Taylor rule
in their setting has much larger coefficients on inflation and the output gap than the actual
(estimated) Taylor rule of the Federal Reserve. Sack (2000) provides more evidence by performing
a similar exercise and showing that the response of the federal funds rate to five identified economic
shocks should be stronger than what is actually observed.
This paper argues that the two stylized facts above may be linked. In fact, both the
economic literature and the practice of policy-making assign a relevant role to core inflation
indices. These indices filter out high frequency fluctuations from prices in order to improve the
understanding of medium-term inflationary pressures on the economy (for a survey of methods see
Cristadoro et al., 2005). In particular, simple core inflation indices are derived by eliminating the
most volatile components (usually, unprocessed food and energy prices) from the aggregate price
index. How does this practice of central banks affect their behavior? In particular, do central banks
behave more or less aggressively by using core inflation rather than overall inflation as a measure to
assess inflationary pressures?
Aoki (2001) studies an economy featuring a continuum of sticky price goods and one
flexible price good and shows that, in this economy, an optimizing central bank should fully
stabilize inflation in the sticky price sector rather than overall inflation. Sticky price inflation,
responding to smoothed expectations of output gaps and relative price changes, is defined as core
inflation to the extent that it captures a persistent component of inflation. Both the form of nominal
rigidities in Aoki (2001) and the definition of core inflation are maintained in this paper.
However, in contrast to Aoki (2001), this paper assumes the existence of nonnegligible
transaction frictions. This creates a trade-off between macroeconomic stabilization (that is,
stabilization of inflation and the output gap) and interest rate stabilization, a feature that is rather
plausible empirically. As a result of this assumption, full stabilization of core inflation is no longer
the only desired target of the optimizing central bank. Then, the equilibrium solution for inflation,
aggregate activity and the interest rate conditional to the policy rule followed by the central bank
are derived, based on two assumptions.
First, it is assumed that the central bank can only implement an optimal noninertial plan as
in Woodford (1999): the policy instrument is assumed to be a linear function of only present and
future values of policy relevant variables. Conditional to the optimal non-inertial plan, the dynamics
of the economy can be derived analytically in order to identify the drivers of the aggressiveness in
the reaction of the interest rate to shocks. Comparing the outcomes in the economy with
heterogeneous price setters (heterogeneous economy) with those in an economy with 100% of
sticky price goods (hereafter, baseline New Keynesian economy, described in Woodford, 1999), it
turns out that the optimal non-inertial plan in the heterogeneous economy may generate less
aggressive responses of the interest rate to supply and demand shocks than in the baseline New
Keynesian (NK) economy. A sufficient condition for the latter is that output is rather interest
sensitive, that is the transmission of the monetary impulse to output is rather strong. In fact, the
presence of sectorial heterogeneity in nominal rigidities makes aggregate activity less interest-
sensitive than in the baseline fully sticky price economy. This effect is more pronounced the
stronger the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to output. Moreover, inflation sensitivity
to output is "small" when output is strongly interest-sensitive. These two features reduce the
willingness of monetary policy-makers to engage in macroeconomic stabilization increasing their
willingness to preserve interest rate stability. However, if the sufficient condition above is not
satisfied, other structural features of the economy shape the aggressiveness of monetary policy.
Finally, the assumption of forward-looking policy is relaxed and it is shown that the
unconstrained optimal and time consistent policy rule of the central bank features history-
dependence. Conditional to this policy, the equilibrium path for inflation, output gap and the
interest rate can no longer be analytically derived. Numerical outcomes show that, conditional to the
fully optimal policy and to a wide range of parameters, the reaction of the interest rate to supply and
demand shocks is less aggressive in the heterogeneous economy compared with the fully sticky
economy.
Hence, a central bank in an economy featuring heterogeneity in the mechanisms of price
adjustments is more likely to behave less aggressively than in a fully sticky economy.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Sektorale Heterogenität bei der Preissetzung ist eine gut belegte Tatsache. So sind etwa
Bils und Klenow (2004) und Dhyne et al. (2004) der Frage nach der Häufigkeit von
Preisanpassungen für VPI-Daten in verschiedenen Sektoren der Vereinigten Staaten und des
Euro-Währungsgebiets nachgegangen. Jeden Monat werden durchschnittlich rund 15 % der
Preise im Eurogebiet und 25 % der Preise in den Vereinigten Staaten angepasst. Am
aussagekräftigsten dabei sind jedoch die Unterschiede zwischen den einzelnen Sektoren. So
werden die Preise für Energie und unverarbeitete Nahrungsmittel im Eurogebiet und den
Vereinigten Staaten am häufigsten angepasst, während sich die Preise für Dienstleistungen als
am rigidesten erweisen.
Eine andere recht bekannte Tatsache ist die erstaunliche ,,Vorsicht", die Zentralbanken,
und insbesondere die Federal Reserve, bei der Durchführung der Geldpolitik augenscheinlich an
den Tag legen. So schätzen Rudebusch und Svensson (1999) beispielsweise ein kleines Modell
der US-Wirtschaft und zeigen unter Annahme einer allgemein akzeptierten Verlustfunktion für
die Zentralbank auf, dass die optimale Taylor-Regel in ihrem Szenario viel größere
Koeffizienten der Inflation und der Produktionslücke als die eigentliche (geschätzte) Taylor-
Regel der Federal Reserve hat. Sack (2000) liefert in einer ähnlichen Analyse weitere Belege
dafür, dass die Reaktion der federal funds rate auf fünf identifizierte konjunkturelle Schocks
stärker als tatsächlich beobachtet ausfallen sollte.
Im vorliegenden Papier wird argumentiert, dass zwischen den beiden oben genannten
stilisierten Fakten ein Zusammenhang bestehen könnte. In der Tat weist sowohl die
wissenschaftliche Literatur als auch die reale Geldpolitik den Indikatoren für die Kerninflation
eine wichtige Rolle zu. Diese Indikatoren filtern Hochfrequenzschwankungen aus den Preisen
heraus, um zu einem besseren Verständnis des mittelfristigen Preisdrucks auf die Wirtschaft zu
gelangen (ein Überblick über die Methoden findet sich in Cristadoro et al., 2005). So werden
einfache Kerninflationsraten ermittelt, indem man die volatilsten Komponenten (normalerweise
sind dies die Preise für unverarbeitete Nahrungsmittel und Energie) aus dem Gesamtpreisindex
ausschließt. Inwieweit wirkt sich diese Praxis der Zentralbanken auf ihr eigenes Verhalten aus?
Verhalten sie sich durch Zugrundelegung der Kerninflation aggressiver oder weniger aggressiv,
als wenn sie die Gesamtinflation als Messgröße zur Beurteilung des Inflationsdrucks
verwenden?
Aoki (2001) untersucht eine Volkswirtschaft, die durch ein Kontinuum rigider
Güterpreise (,,sticky prices") und einem Gut mit flexiblen Preisen gekennzeichnet ist, und zeigt,
dass eine optimierende Zentralbank in dieser Volkswirtschaft die Entwicklung im Sektor der
rigiden Preise vollkommen stabilisieren sollte statt die Gesamtinflation. Eine träge Anpassung
des Güterpreisniveaus (,,Sticky-price-Inflation") - als Reaktion auf geglättete Erwartungen in
Bezug auf die Produktionslücken und relativen Preisänderungen - wird insoweit als
Kerninflation definiert, als dass sie eine dauerhafte, rigide Komponente der Inflation
widerspiegelt. Sowohl die Form der nominalen Rigiditäten gemäß Aoki (2001) als auch die
Definition der Kerninflation werden in diesem Papier beibehalten.
Anders als Aoki (2001) unterstellt dieses Papier jedoch die Existenz von nicht zu
vernachlässigenden Transaktionsfriktionen. Dies schafft einen Zielkonflikt zwischen
makroökonomischer Stabilisierung (d. h. Stabilisierung von Inflation und Produktionslücke)
und Zinsstabilisierung - was empirisch recht plausibel ist. Aufgrund dieser Annahme stellt die
vollkommene Stabilisierung der Kerninflation nicht mehr das einzige angestrebte Ziel der
optimierenden Zentralbank dar. Dann werden die Gleichgewichtslösungen für die Inflation, die
gesamtwirtschaftliche Aktivität und den Zinssatz nach der von der Zentralbank angewandten
geldpolitischen Regel auf Basis von zwei Annahmen abgeleitet.
Zunächst wird angenommen, dass die Zentralbank lediglich einen Optimal Noninertial
Plan wie in Woodford (1999) umsetzen kann: Das geldpolitische Instrument ist den Annahmen
zufolge ausschließlich eine lineare Funktion der gegenwärtigen und zukünftigen Werte der
geldpolitisch relevanten Variablen. Im Rahmen des Optimal Noninertial Plan lässt sich die
Wirtschaftsdynamik analytisch ableiten, um die Bestimmungsfaktoren der Aggressivität der
Zinsreaktion auf Schocks zu ermitteln. Vergleicht man die Resultate in der von heterogener
Preissetzung geprägten Wirtschaft (heterogene Wirtschaft) mit den Resultaten in einer
Wirtschaft mit hundertprozentiger Preisrigidität (nachfolgend bezeichnet als Baseline New
Keynesian Economy, wie in Woodford 1999 beschrieben), so stellt sich heraus, dass der
Optimal Noninertial Plan in der heterogenen Wirtschaft weniger aggressive Reaktionen des
Zinssatzes auf Angebots- und Nachfrageschocks zur Folge hat als in der Baseline New
Keynesian (NK) Economy. Als hinreichende Vorraussetzung für Letzteres gilt, dass die
Produktionsleistung recht zinsempfindlich ist, d. h., die Transmission des monetären Impulses
auf die Produktion ist ziemlich stark. In der Tat bewirkt eine sektorale Heterogenität bei
nominalen Rigiditäten, dass die gesamtwirtschaftliche Aktivität weniger zinssensitiv reagiert als
es in der Baseline Economy mit vollkommen rigiden Preisen der Fall wäre. Je stärker der
Transmissionsmechanismus der Geldpolitik auf die Produktion, umso ausgeprägter ist dieser
Effekt. Darüber hinaus ist die Reagibilität der Inflation auf die Produktion ,,gering", wenn die
Produktion sehr zinssensitiv ist. Diese zwei Besonderheiten reduzieren die Bereitschaft der
Geldpolitik, sich eingehend mit makroökonomischer Stabilisierung zu beschäftigen, und
erhöhen ihre Bereitschaft, Zinsstabilität zu wahren. Ist jedoch die oben erwähnte hinreichende
Voraussetzung nicht erfüllt, so sind es andere strukturelle Merkmale der Wirtschaft, die die
Aggressivität der Geldpolitik bestimmen.
Schließlich wird die Annahme der vorausschauenden Geldpolitik abgeschwächt und
gezeigt, dass die uneingeschränkte, optimale und zeitkonsistente geldpolitische Regel der
Zentralbank vergangenheitsbezogen ist. Dadurch bedingt kann der Gleichgewichtspfad für
Inflation, Produktionslücke und Zinssatz nicht mehr analytisch abgeleitet werden. Numerische
Ergebnisse zeigen, dass bei einer vollkommen optimalen Geldpolitik und einer breiten Palette
an Parametern die Reaktion des Zinssatzes auf Angebots- und Nachfrageschocks in der
heterogenen Wirtschaft nicht so aggressiv ausfällt wie in einer vollkommen rigiden Wirtschaft.
Folglich verhält sich eine Zentralbank in einer Wirtschaft, deren
Preisanpassungsmechanismen sich durch Heterogenität auszeichnen, aller Wahrscheinlichkeit
nach weniger aggressiv als in einer vollkommen rigiden Wirtschaft.

Aoki (2001) studies an economy featuring a continuum of sticky price goods and

should fully stabilize inflation in the sticky price sector rather than overall inflation.
Sticky price inflation, responding to smoothed expectations of output gaps and relative

definition of core inflation are maintained in this paper.
However, in contrast to Aoki (2001), this paper assumes the existence of non-
negligible transaction frictions. This creates a trade-off between macroeconomic stabi-

full stabilization of core inflation is no longer the only desired target of the optimizing

out that the optimal non-inertial plan in the heterogeneous economy may generate
less aggressive responses of the interest rate to supply and demand shocks than in the

put gap and the interest rate can no longer be analytically derived. Numerical outcomes
show that, conditional to the fully optimal policy and to a wide range of parameters,
the reaction of the interest rate to supply and demand shocks is less aggressive in the
heterogeneous economy compared with the fully sticky economy.
Hence, a central bank in an economy featuring heterogeneity in the mechanisms
of price adjustments is more likely to behave less aggressively than in a fully sticky
economy.
The structure of the paper is as follows: section 2 presents the model economy and
its loglinear approximation; section 3 describes the optimal monetary policy problem;
section 4 solves the optimal monetary problems and provides an interpretation for the
results; section 5 concludes.
2 The Model
Heterogeneity in the degree of nominal rigidities across sectors is a relevant empirical
feature in the United States and the euro area. Consequently, a model that describes the
optimal behavior of the monetary policy-maker should take this feature into account.
To this end, this paper follows Aoki (2001) by adopting a framework in which there is
a good that has a flexible price2 and a continuum of differentiated goods whose price
2Benigno (2003) and Woodford (2003) specify two sectors (or countries) models with different degrees
of price stickiness and imperfect competition. However, the simplified framework of Aoki (2001) is
adopted here in order to account for the extremely skewed distribution of frequency of adjustment in

The economy is populated by a continuum (0 - 1) of infinitely lived households.
Each household can work at the production of only one single good. A fraction of size
 of these households supply their labor for the production of a continuum 0 -  of
differentiated sticky price goods. The remaining households (of measure 1 - ) supply
their services for the production of a flexible price good. Households receive utility
directly from holding real balances. The expected utility function of household i is

Household i chooses its optimal contingent plan for consumption expenditure, financial

which links the expected evolution of the consumption path to the expected real interest
rate. Higher expected real interest rates induce households to save more and then to a
steeper positively sloped or a flatter negatively sloped consumption path. Notice that
consumption expenditure is not indexed in (2.8) since, in equilibrium, consumers share
risk perfectly. Money demand is the same for all agents: it is positively affected by the
level of transactions and negatively affected by the opportunity cost of holding wealth
in the form of money, the risk-free interest rate. In fact,

that is, they equal the marginal rate of substitution between hours worked and con-
sumption to the real wage they earn. Firms set prices optimally by taking the demand
for their goods as given. For each good i, the following market clearing conditions hold
ys,t(i) = cs,t(i)
and
yf,t = cf,t
that, on aggregate, imply
Yst = Cst, Yft = Cft, Yt = Ct
Moreover, the production function of each of the firms takes the simple linear form
yj,t(i) = Aj,thj,t(i) (2.15)
where there is only a production input, labor, whose marginal productivity is affected by
a stochastically evolving and possibly sector-specific technological factor. Consequently,
total variable costs for producer i in sector j are represented by

be able to reset its price. Moreover, such a firm takes into account a demand curve
for its good of the form (2.12). Finally, as in Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), the
production in the sticky price sector is subsidized at a rate  such that the effects of
markup pricing in monopolistic competition are completely offset. Consequently, firm

In order to solve the model, the first order conditions are loglinearized around a

As for aggregate demand, loglinearization of the Euler equation (8) provides

which is usually defined as the New IS equation8. As its non-linear counterpart, this
equation states that the expected slope of the temporal path of aggregate demand de-
pends on the expected real interest rate it
- Ett+1. However, the sensitivity of the
path to the riskless interest rate (and consequently to monetary policy) is affected by
the (steady state) value of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1

. The
more agents are willing to substitute intertemporally (that is, the bigger the elasticity
of intertemporal substitution), the more aggregate demand is sensitive to the interest
rate and hence to monetary policy. The equations (2.11) and (2.12), relating to the in-
dividual demand for goods, can be aggregated and loglinearized providing the sectorial
demand curves

which are downward sloping in the corresponding prices relative to the overall index.
Importantly, sectorial outputs may be affected by the other sector dynamics through
their dependence on aggregate output and the linkages in relative prices xft and xst,
highlighted in equation (2.21). The first order condition for real balances (2.9) gives
mt = yyt
- iit + t (2.26)
where y and i are two positive coefficients, while t is a composite shock that involves
both Bt and Dt
9. This equation is a stochastic version of the traditional LM equation
where money demand depends positively on the level of transactions and negatively
on the opportunity cost of holding wealth in a monetary form. Natural (or potential)
output10 can be derived by setting prices equal to current marginal cost in both sectors.

one obtains

noticing that, if the labor supply shock and the technology shock are common to the
whole economy, natural output in the sticky price sector and in the flexible price sector
are the same. Aggregate output gap gt is defined as

difference equation in p

Core inflation is forward-looking because firms forecast the future evolution of their
marginal costs when they are allowed to reset the price, as they might not be able to
adjust it in the future. For the sake of simplicity, the elasticity of inflation to current
output gap is defined as
k =

3 The policy problem
This section describes the objectives of monetary policy and the constraints that the
structure of the economy imposes on the central bank in setting the desired contingent
path for the welfare relevant variables.
The quadratic loss function12 of the central bank may be derived by means of a
second order Taylor approximation13 to the utility function of the agents that gives

and
12For a derivation, see appendix 1.
13In deriving the approximation, the transaction frictions described in the previous section are as-
sumed to be "small" in the sense of Woodford (2003). Moreover, it is also assumed that the government
subsidizes production in the sticky price sector in order to eliminate the effects of monopolistic pricing,
as in Rotemberg and Woodford (1997). On the consequences of different assumptions (small or delib-
erately large monopolistic distortions and distortionary taxation), see Woodford (2003) and Benigno
and Woodford (2004).

(3.36)
represent, respectively, the weights of interest rate and output gap stabilization relative
to core inflation stabilization14 and i = ln 1
1+iss
with iss equal to the steady state value
of the nominal interest rate. As in Aoki (2001), the central bank in this economy must
stabilize core inflation (st) and aggregate output gap (gt). Output gap appears in
the loss function because the level of aggregate output in the economy is inefficient,
due to nominal rigidities rather than imperfect competition, whose effect on output is
eliminated by a government subsidy. However, eliminating the output gap is not enough
to lead the economy to an efficient allocation of resources. In fact, price staggering
implies an inefficient dispersion of prices. Such a distortion is eliminated by setting
inflation to zero, which explains why inflation in the sticky price sector (core inflation)
appears as an argument in the loss function. The relative price of the flexible good
with respect to the aggregate is set at a sub-optimal level from a social welfare point
of view only because of the linkages between the two sectors highlighted in (2.21).
Consequently, eliminating distortions in the sticky price sector is enough to restore the
efficient allocation in the flexible price sector and in the aggregate, as well. This is why
no variables relative to the flexible price sector appear explicitly in the loss function.
Output gap and core inflation stabilization will be jointly referred to as "macroeconomic
stabilization" from now on.
On the other hand, the central bank in this model should also dampen fluctuations
in its operating target, the risk-free interest rate, differently from Aoki (2001). In
fact, money provides services to the agents and is included in their utility functions.
Consequently, the central bank should give the agents as much money as needed to
satiate them, driving the nominal interest rate to the return earned by money15. Hence,
every variation of the interest rate from the return to money16 is penalized in the loss
function of the central bank. Hereafter, this objective will be defined as "operating
target stabilization".
Operating target stabilization generally runs counter to macroeconomic stabiliza-
tion. In fact, in (2.32), macroeconomic stabilization implies that the real interest rate
equals the natural interest rate rn
t
, while operating target stabilization requires the
nominal interest rate to be constantly equal to zero. The consequences of this trade-off
will be explored at length in the next section.
The structure of the economy acts as a constraint in the problem of the central
bank. Usually, one must consider the equations defining the dynamics of aggregate
activity (2.32) and inflation in the sticky price goods (2.30). On the other hand, notice
that, from equation (2.22)
t = st +
1 - 

xft
14The weights depend on the deep parameters coming from the microfoundations of the model. The
only parameter that has not been defined before is v, which represents steady state "money velocity".
15This fact is commonly defined as the Friedman Rule.
16Assumed to be zero in this paper.
10
implying that in order to solve for inflation and aggregate activity, the evolution of the
relative price in the flexible price sector is to be taken into account. To this end, by
loglinearizing (2.16) we get
xft = c(yt
- yn
ft
) (3.37)
where
c =
 + 
1 + 
By replacing aggregate inflation in (2.32) with (2.22), the system of equations de-
fined by (2.30) and (2.32) includes the three variables st, gt and xft, as well as the
monetary policy instrument it. Furthermore, (3.37) provides an expression for xft that
depends only on the sectorial output gap in the flexible price sector. Assuming that
all the shocks in the economy are common, sectorial output gaps become equal to
aggregate output gap. This implies
xft = cgt (3.38)
that can be used to eliminate xft giving
gt = Et(gt+1) -
1
S
(it
- Etst+1 - rn
t
) (3.39)
where
S =  +
1 - 

c >  (3.40)
In other words, the central bank is only subject to the two constraints (2.30) and
(3.39) in its minimization problem. Notice that this problem is isomorphic to the one
in Giannoni (2002) and Woodford (1999) "baseline New Keynesian model". However,
inflation is replaced by core inflation and the parameters are different17. As the size of
the sticky price sector () approaches 1, core inflation approaches overall inflation and
the problem here converges to the one in the baseline New Keynesian model. Then,
the outocmes for the heterogeneous ( < 1) economy of this paper are easily compared
to those of the baseline model retrieved by setting  = 1.
Assuming, instead, that the technological and/or labor supply shocks are sector
specific, xft depends on the relative sectorial output gap rather than the aggregate
output gap. At any rate, a structural constraint in the same form as (3.39) can be
easily derived for this case as well. In fact, by defining
xn
ft
= c(yn
t
- yn
ft
) (3.41)
17Giannoni (2002) and Woodford (1999) specify the same loss function as in this paper but with
arbitrary weights on the different objectives. Instead, here the weights come from the microfoundations
of the model. This makes it possible to measure the impact of a different  (smaller than 1 as in the
current model, rather than equal to 1 as in the baseline New Keynesian) on the relative importance of
the macroeconomic and operating target stabilization.
11
as the natural relative flexible price18, it can be shown that
gt = Et(gt+1) -
1
S
(it
- Etst+1 - ut) (3.42)
where, again
S =  +
1 - 

c > 
and
ut = rn
t
- Etxft+1 (3.43)
Hence, assuming sectorial technology and labor supply shocks, the optimal problem of
the central bank remains virtually the same. The only difference in (3.42) with respect
to (3.39) is in the interpretation of the composite shock. For this reason, this paper
only deals with the case of common shocks.
Summing up, in the economy outlined in the previous section, the central bank aims
to minimize a loss function that embeds quadratic terms in core inflation, aggregate
output gap and the interest rate. Both in the case of common and sectorial technology
and labor supply shocks, the central bank is subject to two structural constraints (2.30
and 3.39 or 3.42) on the evolution of aggregate output and sticky price inflation. What
changes on the basis of the assumption on the shocks, is the stochastic process (and
interpretation) of the composite shocks appearing in the equations that define the
evolution of aggregate activity (3.39 and 3.42). Finally, the results obtained in this
paper are easily compared to those in the baseline model solved by Woodford (1999)
and Giannoni (2002) retrieved by setting  = 1 in the results for the model with
heterogeneity.
4 Optimal monetary policy
This section derives the optimal monetary policy followed by the central bank in het-
erogeneous and baseline economies and studies the consequences (in terms of reaction
of the interest rate to shocks) of their implementation.
In particular, in the first sub-section the central bank is assumed to follow the
optimal policy from a timeless perspective in the class of the forward-looking policies
(optimal non-inertial plan). While this policy is sub-optimal because of the constraints
imposed by the forward-looking assumption, it permits to solve analytically for the
path of the interest rate contingent to shocks and provides intuition on the mecha-
nisms explaining the different reactions of a central bank in heterogeneous and baseline
economies.
The second sub-section, on the other hand, derives the monetary policy that is fully
optimal. This policy is not in the class of forward-looking policies since it features.
18This is the (logarithmic) relative price in the flexible sector that would prevail were the whole
economy to feature flexible prices. This variable is different from zero only if, as in this case, the two
sectors can be affected by different shocks.
12
However, results from the forward-looking case can be used in order to interpret the
dynamics of baseline and heterogeneous economies under such a policy.
4.1 The optimal non-inertial plan
In this sub-section, it is assumed that the central bank implements a purely forward-
looking policy: it sets its policy rate at each date depending only on the set of develop-
ments for the target variables that are possible from that period onwards. In particular,
it follows a simple rule of the form19
it = iss + (st
- ss) (4.44)
Among the forward-looking plans, the central bank is assumed to follow the optimal
non-inertial plan20, that is the forward-looking policy minimizing the unconditional
expectation of the loss function L over the stationary distribution of the possible initial
exogenous states rn
0
. This implies that the optimal plan does not depend on the state
of the economy at the time when the commitment is made, so that the central bank
policy is time consistent as in Woodford (1999, 2003). Moreover,  is assumed to
imply determinacy of the rational expectation equilibrium. As a consequence of the
determinacy and the AR(1) assumption for the shocks, the path followed by the interest
rate, output gap and core inflation under the optimal non-inertial plan is
it = iss + firn
t
, gt = gss + fgrn
t
, st = ss + frn
t
(4.45)
where iss, gss and ss are the steady state values for the nominal interest rate, the out-
put gap and core inflation under the optimal policy defined in (4.45). Replacing (4.45)
in (3.39), (3.34) and (2.30) and taking the unconditional expectation, the optimization
problem of the entral Bank becomes
min
fi,fg,f,iss,gss,ss
ss2 + i(iss - i)2 + ggss2 + (f2

+ if2

g

t
) (4.46)
subject to
f(1 - ) = kfg
fg(1 - ) =
1
S
(1 + f - fi)
and
ss(1 - ) = kgss
19As for the specific form of the rule, notice that a slightly more complicated rule that also includes
the output gap would not improve on this simple one. In fact, since the relevant stochastic term for
the problem of the central bank is only the exogenous natural interest rate rn
t
or the composite shock
ut
, a single variable rule is able to implement the non-inertial plan.
20See Woodford (2003) for an application.
13
iss = ss
This optimization problem may be split into two independent parts. On the one hand,
the steady state component (choosing iss, gss, ss) and, on the other hand, the choice
of fi, fg and f for stabilization purposes. The focus of this paper is exclusively on
the impulse response function of the interest rate to shocks, so we only deal with the
solutions for fi, fg and f
21. The first order conditions for the stabilization problem
are
f
- 
1
S
+ (1 - ) = 0 (4.47)
gfg + (1 - ) - k = 0 (4.48)
ifi + 
1
S
= 0 (4.49)
where  and  are the lagrangian multipliers associated with the structural constraints.
Together with the constraints, the first order conditions define a system of five linear
equations whose solution22 is
fi =
g(1 - )2 + k2
g(1 - )2 + k2 + i [S(1 - )(1 - ) - k]2
(4.50)
f =
ki(S(1 - )(1 - ) - k)
g(1 - )2 + k2 + i [S(1 - )(1 - ) - k]2
fg =
i(1 - ) [S(1 - )(1 - ) - k]
g(1 - )2 + k2 + i [S(1 - )(1 - ) - k]2
The coefficient  that implements the desired equilibrium is easily derived since from
(4.44) it holds
fi = f
which implies
 =
g(1 - )2 + k2
ki(S(1 - )(1 - ) - k)
(4.51)
The analysis is restricted to positive values of  and  has to be bigger than one to
ensure determinacy. This implies
0 < S(1 - )(1 - ) - k <
g(1 - )2 + k2
ki
(4.52)
21The interested reader is referred to Woodford (1999, 2003) for the steady state solution in this
context.
22From the solution for st,
gt
and it
, one can derive the solution for all the other variables in the
economy.
14
g(1-)2+k2
ki
is positive, implying that the set of parameters identified in (4.52) is non-
empty.
The impulse response function of the interest rate to a natural rate shock is char-
acterized by the coefficient fi, as in Giannoni (2002). It must also be noted that fi is
always positive and can take values between 0 and 1. In the policy problem defined in
Aoki (2001), fi is equal to 1, due to the lack of stabilization trade-offs for the central
bank. Hence, fi is independent of the size of the flexible price sector in that economy.
However, when the central bank faces a trade-off between macroeconomic stabilization
and operating target stabilization it may not be optimal to set fi to 1. Operating
target stabilization would require fi to be as small as possible, closer to 0 than 1 and
the central bank eventually sets fi at the intermediate level reflecting the right balance
among conflicting objectives. Interestingly, the optimal fi when there is a trade-off
does depend on , the size of the sticky price sector.
Studying the way in which fi depends on the size of the sticky price sector sheds light
on the question if, under certain circumstances, the optimal non-inertial plan in the
heterogeneous economy leads to a less aggressive (a smaller fi) reaction of the interest
rate than in the baseline New Keynesian economy. The difference in the aggressiveness
of the central bank in the two economies can be analyzed by comparing the fi in (4.50)
with f
i
, the counterpart to fi in the baseline case  = 1. Notice that the value of 
affects both the structural equations and the weights of the three economic variables
in the loss function. In fact, besides (3.40), the following relationships hold between
coefficients in the heterogeneous and in the baseline models23
k =
k

(4.53)
i =

i

(4.54)
g =

g
2
(4.55)
The higher weights to interest and output gap stabilization with respect to inflation
in the heterogeneous economy arise because in this type of economy, the sticky price
distortion affects a smaller fraction of the firms than in the baseline economy. Moreover,
sticky price inflation is more sensitive to the level of the output gap in the model with
heterogeneity than in the one without (k > k) and then the output gap weight is
further magnified in the model with heterogeneity even relative to the interest rate
stabilization objective.
Setting  = 1, we can derive the optimal reaction of the interest rate to a shock in
the baseline case, that is
f

g
(1 - )2 + k2

g
(1 - )2 + k2 + 
i
[(1 - )(1 - ) - k]2
(4.56)
23Coefficients of the baseline model are denoted by a star.
15
In order to facilitate the comparison between fi and f
i
, we can use equations from
(4.53) to (4.55) and (3.40) to rearrange terms in fi such that
fi =

g
(1 - )2 + k2

g
(1 - )2 + k2 + 
i

{[ + (1 - )c] (1 - )(1 - ) - k2}2
(4.57)
and consequently
fi < f
i

1

{[ + (1 - )c] (1 - )(1 - ) - k}2 > [(1 - )(1 - ) - k]2
(4.58)
The inequality in (4.58) holds if  is smaller than or equal to 124. In fact, in that
case  is smaller than or equal to c and the left hand side of the equality in (4.58) is
bigger than or equal to the right hand side. However, when  is big enough, fi can
be either bigger than, smaller than or equal to f
i
depending on other features of the
economy.
The result can be interpreted by looking at equation (3.39) and (3.40), which allow
us to recast the monetary policy problem in the model with heterogeneity in a format
that only includes the policy relevant variables (which are those that explicitly appear
in the loss function of the central bank) and is directly comparable to the traditional
problem in the baseline New Keynesian model. These equations imply that the central
bank in the model with nominal heterogeneity behaves like a central bank in a model
with a representative sector but with output less interest-sensitive than in the baseline
case (S > ). Then, in the heterogeneous model, the monetary policy-maker has less
incentive to use monetary policy for macroeconomic stabilization than in the baseline
case since she acts as though monetary policy were less effective at dampening the
fluctuations in aggregate activity and consequently in inflation. This explains why she
rather engages in more interest rate stabilization and then the smaller reaction of the
interest rate to economic shocks. However, when  is big, the result is not so clear
cut and, depending on the values taken by other structural parameters, both more or
less aggressive behavior can stem from the optimal plan in the heterogeneous economy
relative to the baseline. The ratio
S

= 1 +
1 - 
(1 + )
+
(1 - )

(4.59)
may help to understand why. S is always bigger than  implying that the policymaker in
the core model always behaves as if output were less sensitive than in the baseline case,
but this ratio decreases with the increase in , stabilizing around 1 + 1-
(1+)
. Hence,
the difference in the strength of the effects of monetary policy on output tends to
decrease when  increases, making output less interest-sensitive. Moreover, an increase
24Notice that the positivity constraint on 
implies that [ + (1 - )c] (1 - )(1 - ) - k2 is
positive. The inequality also holds for some values of  bigger than 1 since the result can be extended
to those values by continuity. However, deriving the exact upper bound for  is cumbersome and does
not add much content to the main message of the paper.
16
in  increases k more than k as shown by (4.53) and (2.31). Sticky price inflation
is still more sensitive to aggregate activity in the core model than in the baseline
model, but this difference is magnified by the increase in . These two factors imply
that macroeconomic stabilization becomes more attractive relative to operating target
stabilization for the central bank in the core model when  increases. Eventually,
macroeconomic stabilization may become more important in the heterogeneous model
than in the baseline model relative to operating target stabilization, explaining why
monetary policy might turn out to be more aggressive in the former than in the latter
economy.
4.2 The unconstrained optimal interest rule
Although it allows useful insights, in general the optimal non-inertial plan represents a
sub-optimal choice and also one that is not fully supported by the empirical analysis on
the behavior of central banks. Indeed, with forward-looking private agents the central
bank can improve on the non-inertial plan by committing to some form of inertial
behavior that could shape expectations towards a stronger stabilization of the welfare
relevant variables. Moreover, lagged interest rate terms are shown to be empirically
relevant for the analysis of the behavior of central banks.
The fully optimal and time consistent interest rule of the central bank solves the
following problem25:

Demanding that this policy is already in place at time 0 and 1 allows the cen-
tral bank to achieve time consistency (that is, it implements the policy that is optimal
from a timeless perspective). The optimal rule has some notable features already inves-
tigated by Giannoni and Woodford (2002b) for the baseline New Keynesian economy26:

- it is history-dependent in that the optimal interest rates depends on its own two
lags and on the first lag of the output gap;
- it resembles a Taylor rule in that the optimal interest rate is a linear function of
inflation and the output gap.
Next, in order to derive the dynamics of this economy and, in particular, of the
interest rate in response to shocks, the following system of three stochastic difference
equations has to be solved:
st = Etst+1 + kgt (4.60)
gt = Et(gt+1) -

It can be proved27 that, under this policy, the economy can follow only one contin-
gent path (in other words, the solution is determinate) for any value of the parameters.
However, the solution for this system is to be derived numerically28 due to the presence
of three more state variables (the lags of the interest rate and output gap) than in the
optimal non-inertial plan.
As in the previous section, the focus here is on the reaction of the nominal interest
rate to a unitary shock in rn
t
, comparing the outcomes in the heterogeneous to those
in the baseline New Keynesian economy. In order to solve the model, numerical values
have to be assigned to the parameters in equations (4.60) to (4.62). The baseline
calibration takes the values of the parameters estimated in Rotemberg and Woodford
(1997), with some exceptions. In particular,  is set to 0.75, a value that is plausible
empirically and that implies that firms reset their price on average once a year (with
quarterly data). More importantly, the model in Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), does
not feature sectoral heterogeneity in the price adjustment mechanisms. Hence, in order
to calibrate the parameter  (the percentage of firms with a sticky price adjustment),
we follow Bils and Klenow (2004) and set it to 0.75. These and the other values of the
structural parameters in this economy are reported in Table 1.
Table 1: Baseline Calibration

Baseline economy 0.99 0.16 1 0.5 0.75 7 0.6 1 1 0.013 0.16 0.003 0.002
27For a proof in the case of the baseline New Keynesian model, see Giannoni and Woodford (2002b).
The case of the heterogeneous economy does not require a separate proof due to the isomorphism of
the two minimization problems
28The numerical solutions are derived by using the AIM algorithm of Anderson and Moore.

Notice that the values of the first nine parameters (from  to ) are assumed, while
the remaining four parameters are non-linear functions of the previous nine. The only
difference in the values of the first nine parameters between the heterogeneous and
baseline New Keynesian economies lies in the percentage of sticky price firms () which
is 100% in the baseline economy. Given these values of the parameters, figure 1 plots
the reaction of the nominal interest rate in the heterogeneous (solid line) and baseline
(dashed line) economies.

Figure 1 shows that, given the values of the parameters assumed in the baseline
calibration, the reaction of the interest rate in the heterogeneous economy is less ag-
gressive than in the baseline economy. In other words, the concern for interest rate
stabilization is more relevant in the heterogeneous economy than in the fully sticky
economy.
However, in the previous section, we saw that higher values of  imply that this
19
result can be reversed, with the reaction of the interest rate being less aggressive in
the baseline than in the heterogeneous economy. Hence, figure 2 reports results on the
reaction of the nominal interest rate in the heterogeneous and baseline New Keynesian
economies under different values of the parameter . In particular, figure 2 reports

which is the ratio of the reaction of the interest rate in the heterogenous economy
relative to the corresponding reaction in the baseline New Keynesian economy at the
time when the shock is realized (t=1). A value smaller than 1 in this ratio indicates
that, on impact, monetary policy is less aggressive in the heterogeneous than in the
baseline economy.

Figure 2 shows that the reaction of the interest rate in the model with heterogeneity
is always less aggressive than in the case where all prices are sticky. This also happens
for very high values of , although the ratio is monotonically increasing for values of 
higher than one. This result partly mirrors those obtained with the non-inertial plan:
for high values of sigma, the relative importance of macroeconomic stabilization with
respect to interest rate stabilization increases more in the model with heterogeneous
price setters than in the baseline New Keynesian model. However, the numerical sim-
ulations show that, conditional to the values assigned to the other parameters of the
20
models in the calibration, the result of a less aggressive reaction of the interest rate in
the heterogeneous economy remains robust for higher values of .
Appendix 2 reports results for the ratio when several other parameters of the model
are assumed to vary from the values assigned in the baseline calibration. The outcome
of these simulations is that the reaction of the nominal interest rate in the heterogeneous
economy remains robustly less aggressive than in the baseline New Keynesian economy.
In conclusion, the result of the attenuation in the reaction of the interest rate to
shocks in the model with heterogeneous price setters is quite robust. This supports
the idea that the puzzling caution in the conduct of monetary policy by actual central
banks may be partly explained by the fact that they take into account the sectorial
heterogeneity in the frequency of price adjustment.
5 Conclusion
This paper analyzes the optimal monetary policy problem of a central bank facing sec-
torial heterogeneity in price setting. The focus is on the reaction of the interest rate to
structural shocks. Comparing this reaction in an economy with heterogeneity with one
in which all goods have sticky prices, it is found that a central bank is much more likely
to react less aggressively to shocks in the heterogeneous economy. Since actual central
banks take into account the sectorial heterogeneity in price setting mechanisms in that
they derive and monitor core inflation indices excluding the most volatile components
of consumer prices, this finding might help to explain why their reaction to shocks is
considered too cautious.

This appendix expounds the steps taken to derive the loss function of the central bank
by means of a second order approximation to social welfare, defined by aggregating the

For simplicity, define for the general variable At,
at = At

where A is the steady state of At, and
at = ln(

Assume, ss in Woodford (2003), that the transaction technology implies that there is
satiation in real money balances at a finite positive level. Moreover, all the conditions
on the partial derivatives of the utility function with respect to consumption and real
balances invoked in Woodford (2003), pg 422 are verified. Besides that, assume that
 = I
1+I
is small and can be treated as an expansion parameter. This leads to the
conclusion that the economy is well approximated in a neighborhood of the steady state
close to the point in which agents are satiated in real balances.

The term on the right hand side represents the dispersion of prices in the sticky price
sector due to the staggered price setting mechanism described by Calvo. Intuitively,
this term depends on inflation in the sticky price sector, since if inflation in the sticky
price sector is zero at each time, no dispersion would be observed among relative prices
set by sticky price setters. Define
ps,t

High values of  reduce the differences in the reaction of the interest rate to shocks
in the heterogeneous economy compared to the baseline. However, the result does not
disappear even for extremely high values of this parameter. The interpretation for
the convergence of the results in the heterogeneous economy to those for the baseline
economy is that, while the sensitivity of inflation to the output gap does not vary
much with , the sensitivity of aggregate activity to the interest rate decreases a lot in
the heterogeneous economy (conditional to the value assigned to ) when  increases.
Then, the central bank engages more and more in macroeconomic stabilization relative
to the baseline economy.
