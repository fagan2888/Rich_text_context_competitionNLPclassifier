Introduction
Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is proliferating
in the lives of most people today. The ubiquity of CMC invites
interesting debate on the phenomenon of meaning making or
success of communication in the digital environment. As a
result, communication theorists (Baron, 2008; Crystal, 2001,
2006; Herring, 1996; Thurlow, Lengel, & Tomic, 2004) have
been investing considerable time to investigate the emergence
of digital meaning. This scenario seems to be shaping if not
determining many aspects of our real life, as has been argued
by Turkle (2011). Herring, Stein, and Virtanen (2013) further
assert that the Internet mirrors co-construction of the self in
an ad hoc manner. The transformation of "the self" from real
to virtual began with the invention of electronically mediated
communication, such as through the telegram, telephone, fax,
and so on, phenomenon that is almost a century and half old.
However, the virtual self has attracted much attention only in
recent years. This transformation manifests an evolution of
meaning-making self, which is expressed through such medi-
ated communication.
One assumes that there is a good reason to believe that the
expression of meaning is fundamental to language. The pres-
ent study hypothesizes that certain mechanisms, primarily
morphemic and syntactic reduction, are one of the ways used
to achieve this end. We also claim that the use of such mini-
mal mechanisms, more obviously in the context of CMC, is
not random, but rather, it is necessitated by the expression of
meaning under the special circumstances in question. It may
sound as though we hold deterministic attitude toward the
relationship between form and meaning, but our intension is
simply to claim the priority of meaning over form.
Much work by the researchers of CMC (Danet & Herring,
2007; Segerstad, 2002; Tagg, 2009; Thurlow & Poff, 2013,
as well as those referred previously) shows a split approach,
either taking formal reduction or minimization to be an act of
linguistic transgression or considering this kind of variation
to be an inherent property of language, as had always been
evident in the nature of historically older forms of reduced
language, for instance, diary register (Weir, 2012, and the
references cited therein). Crystal (2006) asserts that CMC
heralds novel manifestations of this property mirroring lin-
guistic behavior, in ways primarily different, from the tradi-
tional modes of communication as has been noted by
Bodomo (2009). Rafi (2010), arguing on the same lines,
states that Internet users are habitually and increasingly cus-
tomizing language to capture their experiences and to express
their e-identity through various linguistic innovations.
While discussing grammatical features of English, Ko
(1996) finds that electronically governed communication
typically involves relatively short or shortened words. While

Meaning Making Through Minimal
Linguistic Forms in Computer-Mediated
Communication
Muhammad Shaban Rafi1
Abstract
The purpose of this study was to investigate the linguistic forms, which commonly constitute meanings in the digital
environment. The data were sampled from 200 Bachelor of Science (BS) students (who had Urdu as their primary language
of communication and English as one of the academic languages or the most prestigious second language) of five universities
situated in Lahore, Pakistan. The procedure for analysis was conceived within much related theoretical work on text analysis.
The study reveals that cyber-language is organized through patterns of use, which can be broadly classified into minimal
linguistic forms constituting a meaning-making resource. In addition, the expression of syntactic mood, and discourse roles
the participants technically assume tend to contribute to the theory of meaning in the digital environment. It is hoped that the
study would make some contribution to the growing literature on multilingual computer-mediated communication (CMC).

explaining these features, he shows that the use of present
tense, coordinations, adverbials, demonstrating pronouns,
and intensifiers is used more frequently in real-time or online
communication than in any other type of discourse. However,
grammatical forms such as prepositional phrases, relative
clauses, and perhaps subordinate clause in general are com-
paratively infrequent in CMC discourse. Furthermore, he
claims that discourse markers and hedges are, likewise, less
common and the patterns of turn taking are far from neat and
orderly. He also mentions this proportionately the huge role
that icons play in CMC. Kalman and Gergle (2009, 2010)
assert that repetition of punctuation and letters indicates the
stretching of a word, emulating a stretched out syllable like
in spoken conversation. Furthermore, they explain that these
repetitions tend to communicate tempo, pitch, prosody, and
other paralinguistic elements for achieving visual emphasis.
Reporting similar results, Herring (2011) additionally points
out the prevalence of "nonstandard" typography and orthog-
raphy practices. Danet and Herring (2007) note that research
on other languages has exhibited similar tendencies.
Probably, it is no longer the case that the Internet com-
munication is predominantly in English. Bodomo (2009)
asserts that bilingualism/multilingualism has now become
the norm in CMC. As the Internet has been increasingly
becoming multilingual, researchers have explored new pat-
terns of use and language combination in bilingualism/multi-
lingualism communities (e.g., Androutsopoulos, 2007;
Axelsson,Abelin, & Schroeder, 2007; Barasa, 2010; Durham,
2007; Paolillo, 2007; Seargeant, Tagg, & Ngampramuan,
2012; Warschauer, El Said, & Zohry, 2007). The Urdu spo-
ken in Pakistan, largely adopting the linguistic ecology of
English (Rafi, 2013), is case in point. Thus, the use of Urdu
on the Internet is always embedded within a larger
Anglophone context. Not infrequently involving switches
between the two languages or substitution in writing of an
English letter like b for the whole corresponding semi-
homophonous Urdu word more specifically  /b  i:/
which means "also." The substitution noted above does not
lead to any change in meaning; it does, though, just help the
users make meaning by means of minimal linguistic forms.
In general, the present study intends to investigate forms
that are reduced or have unique configurations, and which
are exploited to project the same range of meaning as corre-
sponding full forms. In section "Method," the methodology
and theoretical as well as the linguistic backgrounds are out-
lined. The remaining sections except the concluding one
present an analysis of the data.
Method
Much like researchers dealing with any kind of data,
researchers who deal with digital data are often confronted
with a variety of non-trivial questions. Most of them relate to
the size and representativeness of data samples, data process-
ing techniques, limitations of genres, kind and amount of
necessary contextual information, and ethical issues, such as
anonymity and privacy protection. Keeping such questions
in mind, this section describes the procedures of data collec-
tion, ethical considerations of collecting and handling data,
data analysis, and the theoretical underpinnings.
Data Collection
The first stage of data collection consisted of the selection of
a sample of appropriate participants. The sample included
both male and female students who were between 18 and 24
years of age and were registered in the Bachelor of Science
(BS) program in five different universities situated in Lahore,
Pakistan. A pilot study suggested that this cohort was indeed
suitable for the investigation under discussion (see, for
example, Ilyas & Khushi, 2012; Leppänen, 2007; Rafi, 2008,
2010, 2013). This study assumes that CMC is typical of this
age group almost anywhere in the world.
According to Grinter and Eldridge (2001), young people
bring with them to college a well-developed practice of
e-styles. As social networks found relatively young people
its potential users, the present study assumes that they know
how to accommodate and appropriate the English language
in CMC. Jørgensen (2001, as cited in Leppänen, 2007 )
argues that youth can take language in their own possession
and typically active in generating more general language
change. Researchers (e.g., Leppänen, 2007; Paolillo, 2011;
Peuronen, 2008) assert that there is always association
between being young and using new patterns of English
along with the native language.
Facebook being popular forum for conversations among
young people was assumed to be a good source of the data
(cf. Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Raskin, 2006; Sengupta & Rusli,
2012). The data collection was confined to Facebook wall,
which gives easy access to enormous subject pool, without
violating anyone's privacy. Furthermore, it is characterized
by the use of a broad range of traits at the very informal end
of the linguistic spectrum like in a natural setting, which is
the primary focus of the present study.
Sample. The sample was drawn from the five private (by and
large not funded by the State) institutions of higher learning
listed in Table 1. The reason to choose these institutions was
to make the sample as representative of BS students as pos-
sible. In terms of academic, linguistic, and cultural back-
ground, the sample was homogeneous. All the participants
were from BS program but strictly speaking in different disci-
plines (e.g., Business of Administration, Engineering, Com-
puter Sciences, and English) and academic years (e.g.,
covering first year to fourth year). As the participants were
between 18 and 24 years of age, they might be considered
young people. Youth is defined here as a chronological age--
number of years since birth (cf. Leppänen, 2007). Also, com-
munication on Facebook was more or less within the same
group. Notwithstanding the possibility of this forum to
Rafi 3
connect people from different linguistic backgrounds, the
participants in this study were evidently Urdu/English bilin-
guals. It should be added that, strictly speaking, the first lan-
guage of most of them was Punjabi but Urdu was their
primary language of communication, both at home and else-
where, and English was their most important academic lan-
guage and the most prestigious second language. They
acquired Punjabi, however, through informal contact with, for
example, lower or middle lower working class--who speaks
it maybe to mark solidarity and identity. They used to meet
with each other both in offline and online contexts. Moreover,
their communication was not only limited to Pakistani con-
texts but it could be referred to international settings also. The
participants linked and shared activities covering information
exchange, debate, problem solving, exchanging picture,
jokes, and video related to varying themes, such as greeting,
politics, showbiz, sports, and sex. Peuronen (2008) argues
that these activities "best describe their being" (p. 104). Their
communication in online context comprised new creative
ways. Importantly, they identified themselves mostly either
through Urdu or English or both. The data were mainly in
Romanized Urdu, English, or a mixture of Urdu and English.
The corpus used was simply in multiple languages, all written
in the same (Roman) script. Tone used in the message threads
was typically informal; however, a number of snippets
seemed to be formal too. A lot of words that the participants
used were clearly from their specific academic context.
Five volunteers who were also students at these institu-
tions were engaged for help during the process of data col-
lection. Each one of them coordinated the data gathering
process for one of the five institutions. The researcher
shared with them the purpose and ethical boundaries of the
study. Each of them managed to add on average 375 stu-
dents over a period of 2 months. Thus, the researcher had
access to all the students through these volunteers. The data
from only 50 participants from each institution were ana-
lyzed on the basis of the quantity of their posting output.
Table 1 shows the distribution of the sample over the five
institutions. The study investigated linguistic postings of
each participant transmitted over the period of a week. The
logic behind collecting the whole week's data was to
observe most of the linguistic features that the participants
used in their communication. Each posting consisted of
usually more than one utterance. Thus, the data collected
were naturalistic and observational, with minimum inter-
ference from the researcher. However, the participants were
asked questions to seek clarifications where it was abso-
lutely necessary.
Nature of the data.As shown in Table 2, the data were col-
lected from 200 participants whose average age was 21
years. The data indicate that each participant spends on aver-
age 6.25 hr on Facebook per week and hosts on average 150
followers, thus creating the likelihood of feedback on his or
her posting. Of 2,516 linguistic postings, 588 are in Roman-
ized Urdu; 1,135 are in English; and the remaining 793 post-
ings are a blend of both Urdu and English. This shows an
increasing trend of English along with mixed Urdu and Eng-
lish in digital discourse. As is evident from Table 2, the par-
ticipants have shown less and marginal need for Urdu as a
medium of communication. The most plausible reason behind
the marginal use of Urdu is perhaps the importance given to
English in academia. Importantly, English is their most pres-
tigious second language. They come across relatively fewer
opportunities to use written Urdu in their academic context,
for example, examination, project, assignment, and so on.
On average, each posting consisted of 137 words ranging
between 1 and 612 words across the data. As many as 27,476
words are accumulated for the analysis.
Much like face-to-face conversation, communication
between the participants reflected physical approximation.
The illustrations in [1] confirm that the distant or even near
future marking system is marginal in the context of CMC.
Overall, the data included the postings, which demonstrated
participants' relationships regarding how close they were
with their followers.

Types of exchanges. Interactivity is a defining characteris-
tics of CMC, which is organized around topics or threads.
Barnes (2003) defines that "a thread is a chain of interre-
lated messages that respond to each other" (p. 20). A lin-
guistic posting on the wall can be generally described as
fragments, phrases, and clauses. The postings on the wall
evolved in a coherent whole around topics of varying
themes. Mostly, a topic was initiated by a single person fol-
lowed by his or her followers' comments, which was either
closed with words of thanks or reflection from the origina-
tor or left without proper closing. The exchanges on the
wall can be classified into a three-part structure of Initia-
tion, Response, and Reflection (IRR). This IRR structure
can be seen in the following example:
[2]
A: <newly made my own pic>
B: <its awsome bro>
A: <thanks>
Unlike IRR structure, instances of dialogue structures,
two-part adjacency pairs (e.g., question­answer), and non-
linear flow of conversation were also prevalent. The dia-
logue structure and adjacency pair can be seen in [3] and
[4]. The postings in the data were extrovert in nature and
each provided a framework within which the next was
formulated.

Although Facebook is thought to be an asynchronous
technology and it often transmits messages in near-real
time, many participants were observed replying instantly to
postings, rendering the technologically asynchronous
medium effectively synchronous. Thurlow and Poff (2013)
argue that with the convergence of new (and old) media,
technological boundaries and generic distinctiveness of
instant messaging, texting, and emailing are becoming
blurred. Notable examples of this are found in micro-blog-
ging (e.g., Twitter and status updates on Facebook), the
multi-functionality of smart-phones (e.g., BlackBerry) and
to some extent, Apple's iPhone. This study assumes that
dividing Facebook conversations on the wall between syn-
chronous and asynchronous modes may be misleading
because the speed of communication mostly inhibits us to
draw a clear line between synchronous and asynchronous
communication. As there is a range of possibilities, we may
consider the participants' conversation on the wall as falling
between synchronous and asynchronous modes. But strictly
speaking, this study considered Facebook communication
on the wall analogous to asynchronous communication.
The participants used to grid a kind of coherent discourse
because most of their postings were in response to a single
individual's reflections. It was found that communication on
the wall usually occurred between one-to-one or one-
to-many--a kind of interpersonal communication. Barnes
(2003) reinforces the fact that the Internet can be used to
distribute messages in any number of directions, that is, one-
to-one or one-to-many.
Ethical considerations. Ensuring that pre-existing ethical stan-
dards were properly met was crucial. In this study, we
adhered to guidelines suggested by Mann and Stewart (2000)
while collecting data.
The participants were informed about the nature of the
study. They were given assurances regarding confidentiality,
security of information, and unauthorized eavesdropping;
that is, information that might identify the participants,
places, institutions, and times was never to be disclosed. The
participants were identified by means of cryptonyms in
reporting research. Access to the database was restricted to
the participants and the researcher. However, the researcher
could not forbid the use of racist and sexist language, and
other contentious and provocative material. Mann and
Stewart (2000) argue that Internet research does not have to
conform to these restrictions.

Data Analysis
To attempt the research question, minimal linguistic forms
and what they communicate in terms of mood were ana-
lyzed. Jørgensen, Karrebæk, Madsen, and Møller (2011)
remark that linguistic features are best suited as the basis for
the analysis of language in polylanguaging context. These
forms were classified into lexical and syntactic tiers. Word
reduction was further subclassified into abbreviations (e.g.,
gf for "girlfriend"), clippings (e.g., pic for "picture"), and
logograms (e.g., some1 for "someone"). For clarity, logo-
grams were further subclassified into phonetic spelling (u
for "you"), lexo-numeric (gr8 for great for "great"), digito-
lexeme (2morow for "tomorrow"), and digit word semi-
homophone (4 for "for").The purpose of these classifications
and subclassifications was to tabulate precisely the lexical
features for measure of frequency. Frequency was calcu-
lated to gauge how many times a particular feature occurred
and to suggest its permanence in CMC. The frequency of
occurrence was determined if at least a word was repeated
twice within a conversation and a minimum of 5 times in the
whole data.
What CMC-unique structures are, and how they uncover
functional roles, I examined (a) types of structures, (b)
deletion of grammatical features, and (c) syntactic expres-
sion of mood. Types of structures were further classified
into fragmented structure, simple structure, compound
structure, and complex structure. To analyze whether or not
the proportions of structure type are different across the
languages, I calculated chi-square test of independence. As
the characteristic of linguistic reduction was assumed as
one of the key features across the corpus, grammatical
properties, which were commonly deleted, were measured.
This measure provided us with further insight to assess how
far the participants compromised on structural rules when
communicating in digital environment. Furthermore, a
careful analysis of structures constituting mood (e.g.,
declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory)
was examined to uncover functional roles and negotiation
common to Facebook.
In addition to analysis of quantitative data, I also drew
on the message threads to elaborate and support my verdict
concerning the research questions, which helped bring tri-
angulation to increase the credibility and validity of the
results. These snippets were in English, Romanized Urdu,
and mixed English and Urdu. They were demonstrated
within mathematical symbols (such as < >) along with their
transliteration in the parentheses. In relation to paralinguis-
tic features, I considered their visual aspects only as a
meaning-making resource in a message thread. Thus, the
analysis was backed up by a large corpus covering both
quantitative and qualitative data sets, which assisted in
attempting the research questions with more extensive
analysis, with far more participants and more rigorous sam-
pling procedures.
Theoretical underpinning. The procedure for analysis was con-
ceived within much related theoretical work on text analysis.
Sinclair (1991, as cited in Stubbs, 1996) argues that intuitive
judgments are particularly untrustworthy with respect to fre-
quency and distribution of different forms and meanings of
words, and to the interaction of lexis, grammar, and meaning.
In the present study, against the reliance on invented data,
example utterances were explicitly taken from the data. The
accountability to data was thus taken into account. Unlike
contemporary studies, which are based on a small data set, a
large corpus based study was planned to address the underly-
ing research question. The actual language text duly recorded
was the main concern in the present study. In addition, inter-
pretation of cyber-linguistic features was based on the whole
data rather than relying consistently on a few examples.
There is reason to believe that a few linguistic features of
a text are distributed evenly throughout. To encompass the
whole data, the study recorded the frequency of commonly
occurring minimal lexical as well as syntactic features
across the corpus to draw emerging patterns. One of the
main uses of the corpus is to identify what is central and
typical in the language (Sinclair, 1991, as cited in Stubbs,
1996). Thus, linguistic patterns that reside in a language can
best be judged when they are studied comparatively across
the text corpora.
As noted above, the data were accumulated from five
groups. The purpose behind the selection of different cohorts
was to have a comparative standpoint whether linguistic fea-
tures were spread across the board or concentrated in a par-
ticular cohort. Overall, the data were organized into lexical
and syntactic tiers. Stubbs (1996) argues that the most pow-
erful interpretation emerges if comparisons of texts across
corpora are combined with the analysis of the organization of
individual texts. Another approach would have been to view
linguistic features in several different media genres (e.g.,
email, social networking, and text messaging), though com-
patible with this principle, seems to motivate relatively dif-
ferent linguistic choices (see, for example, Baron, 2008;
Crystal, 2001, 2006; Thurlow & Poff, 2013) on formal and/
or informal end of the linguistic spectrum. Whereas the pri-
mary focus of this study was to collect naturalistic and obser-
vational data that were limited to Facebook communication
on the wall.
Every language is governed by linguistic selections and
restrictions. For example, both Urdu and English pursue lin-
guistic conventions to transform and transmit a structure. We
can, of course, say how are you? or Ap ka kia hal hai? But we
may not say you are how or Ap hai kia hal ka. Hence, gram-
matical structure restricts the lexis that occurs in it, and con-
versely any lexical item can be specified in terms of the
structures (Stubbs, 1996). The study presupposed that the
linguistic flexibility that young people exercised in the medi-
ated communication was based on the system of language
more or less; however, it was the meaning that governed their
apparently peculiar linguistic choices.

Semantic analysis of corpus has been of main concern in
the Firthian school of thought. As Firth (1957, as cited in
Stubbs, 1996) puts it, "You shall know a word by the company
it keeps" (p. 11). Firth's notion of form and meaning in context
was extended by Halliday (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007) in
systemic linguistics. Systemic linguistics adopts a descriptive
approach to language investigation that answers the questions:
What is language? and How does language work? In the same
way, the present study gives importance to the description of
the characteristics of cyber-linguistic features. It may sound as
though we hold deterministic attitude toward the relationship
between form and meaning, but our intension is simply to
claim the priority of meaning over form.
Minimal Linguistic Forms
Word Reduction
Linguistic reduction was the most common feature in the
data. The participants mostly reduced linguistic forms from
Urdu and English. However, it was English which acquired
the impact of linguistic reduction the most. They minimized,
seemingly either through conscious or subconscious efforts,
words by compounding a number and lexeme or morpheme,
for example, some1 for someone, gr8 for great, b4 for before,
and so on. Words that are composed of two syllables in which
one syllable is substituted with a digit and the other remains
constant may be called lexo-numeric. Conversely, the par-
ticipants also customized words, may be labeled digito-
lexeme, by substituting segment or segments of a word with
a digit at the onset, for example, 2morow for tomorrow, 4get
for forget, and so on. Among other categories of reduction,
digit word homophones were prevalent, which were formed
by replacing a full word with a digit, for example, 1 for
"one," 2 for "to" or "too," 4 for "for," and so on. As many as
1,106 words were tabulated in these categories, which can be
grouped under the basic term, namely, logogram. Thus, the
logograms, in many ways, were the most frequently occur-
ring features in cyber-communication of young Pakistani
students.
The initial ambiguity that might have been as a result of
minimal linguistic forms was seemingly compensated, if not
altogether but mostly, through extralinguistic features. Apart
from this, linguistic reduction can further be explained within
the system of language. Furthermore, segmental reduction in
English and Urdu is systematic, which indicates supposedly
uniform patterns for the success of communication.
Reduction in the segments of English words can be charac-
terized by phonological and morphological properties. As
shown in Table 3, the derived forms conform to fixed phono-
logical patterns, which are characterized by templates in which
"C" stands for consonant sound and "V" represents vowel
sound. Moreover, bold letters, for example, "C" stands for the
sound that was picked up while committing the reduction in
the original word. As is evident from the given template,
vowel sound or vowel-like sound is more susceptible to reduc-
tion. Vowel sounds seem to behave like the fillers in consonant
sounds. We may speculate that English words can be read
without vowels exerting a little effort. Conversely, there is no
instance of reduction in consonant sounds; however, the con-
sonant sounds which were reduced are primarily from conso-
nant clusters. Hence, the consonant sound was used to cover
the rest of the segment in a word. Moreover, diphthongs and
weak vowel sounds, especially // to show a sound occurring
at various segmental positions in a word, were occasionally
truncated.As highlighted in the given template, it is the conso-
nant sound in a word which the primary carrier of a meaning
is. This can be compared with early Semitic languages such as
Arabic and Hebrew in which the words' roots were isolated
sets of consonants, for example, inArabic the root word mean-
ing "write" had the form k­t­b. It signifies that the part of lin-
guistic principles have always been recycling since the first
utterance was articulated as has been supported by Napoli and
Lee-Schoenfeld (2010) who assert that our speech contains
archaism--a little fossil from the past.
As noted above, the participants mostly reduced English
forms; however, they simply substituted bi-syllabic Urdu
words with the whole corresponding mono-syllabic English
homophones or semi-homophones--may be considered a
creative way of reducing morphemic properties of Urdu pri-
marily in Romanized script. While substituting Urdu forms
with its English counterparts, the overextended sound had no
or less homophonous correspondence in some instances. It is
evident that the substitution does not cover aspirated sound
because this requires use of superscript [  ] that the partici-
pants simply avoided.

The logic behind these substitutions is that all the above-
mentioned Urdu bi-syllabic words have the same or nearly
the same sound in English alphabets. It seems as a matter of
ease the participants replaced bi-syllabic forms with their
mono-syllabic counterparts in their conversations. Similarly,
they also substituted the following English words with their
counterparts in Urdu.
Table 4 shows that another very interesting phenom-
enon, may be called reduction, is the substitution of Urdu

graphemes with English phonemes as has been noted by Rafi
(2013) andAhmad (2011). There are 38 alphabets in Urdu but
in Romanized Urdu 66% of them are reduced to 24%.Around
58% of Urdu alphabets find seemingly semi-homophonous
corresponding letters in English. Mostly involved substitu-
tions, between Urdu alphabets, for example, / /, / 
/,/  /,//, and / / and English phoneme, for example,
/a/, /d/, /r/, /k or q/, and /g/, respectively. However, switches
between two languages in writing Urdu letters, for example,
and / / for the whole
semi-homophonous English phoneme, for example, /s/, /z/,
/t/, and /h/, respectively, were not infrequent. Surprisingly, the
participants usually reduced English vowel sounds; however,
when Romanizing Urdu, they preferred to minimize mostly
if not always Urdu consonant sounds. More or less, these
instances seem to be a reflection of linguistic accommoda-
tion, which can be used to support the verdict that CMC is
a new discourse. Trudgill (2003) defines accommodation as
"the process whereby participants in a conversation (usu-
ally face-to-face interaction) converge their accent, dialect,
or other language characteristics according to the language
of other participant(s)" (p. 3). Although convergence of
Urdu graphemes with their English counterparts is appar-
ently due to Roman transliteration of the Urdu language,
this leads us to reveal that Urdu alphabets are reduced
more or less to the size of English which are supposedly
compensated with normal key stocks--to avoid complex
application (shift, alt, and shift & alt) that these graphemes
might have required. There is a fair chance that this trend
may continue and consolidate with the present keyboard
features (see, for example, Sperlich, 2005). Investigation
of technological limitations and their impact on languages
have access to Internet can be an interesting study to gauge
how widespread the phenomenon is! However, investiga-
tion of this dimension is beyond the scope of the present
study.
The second most noticeable lexical feature is the reduc-
tion of words to their initial letters. They are known as abbre-
viations. Abbreviations are commonly used and an accepted
trend of writing the initials of words to make a new word that
is not essentially pronounceable. However, there are
instances of abbreviations, which obey phonetic property, for
example, AFAP for as far as possible, SOB for son of bitch,
Yo for your own, and so on. Abbreviations are usually spelled
in capital letters; however, there are cases where the strings
of words were abbreviated in lower case letters also. Like
reduction in the base forms, abbreviations also involve loss
of material. The principle of orthography is, however, of cen-
tral importance in abbreviations, for example, dp for digital
picture, gf for girlfriend, np no problem, and so on. As men-
tioned above, in limited cases, phonetic properties were also
applied to derive abbreviations known as acronyms, for
example, asap for as soon as possible, lol for lot of laughter,
afap for as far as possible, and so on.
/  /, /   /, /  / and / /
8 SAGE Open
There are words that were derived from the first part of
the base word. This process is labeled as clipping. Clippings
appear as a mixed bag of forms reduced from base forms,
which express familiarity with the denotation of the deriva-
tive. Thus, pic was used typically by the participants to refer
to digital image and bro was part of their vocabulary to show
probably an intimate relationship. There are clippings, for
example, add/addy for address, cos for because, fav for
favorite, grats for congratulations, del for delete, dif for dif-
ferent, jus for just, moro for tomorrow, rehi for hello again,
uni for university, and web for website, which are character-
istic features of cyber-communication.
Another unique way of segmental reduction is "g" omis-
sion in words ending with "g." Perhaps, the participants
thought it an additional sound while texting words ending
with "g." In native-English especially in some parts of the
United Kingdom, for example, Norwich, Cardiff, and else-
where, "g" dropping in colloquial speech is pervasive, as if
there is simply an [n] on the end. This is indicative of some
interesting facts such as migration of "g" dropping in the
conversation of the participant that can be used as a corre-
late of foreign culture. This seems to explain that the so-
called linguistic borders are melting down and spreading
linguistic forms of the dominant language, which is English
in our case, through new media communication.
Types of Structures
The participants used typically fragments and sentences (i.e.,
simple, compound, and complex) to carry out their conversa-
tion. Fragment can be referred to a segment of a sentence that
may contain a single word or a string of words. The examples
[4a-4k] indicate fragments consisting of a single word and a
string of words. Three dots on either sides of the structure
indicate a range of missing syntactic elements, for example,
head word, verb (especially auxiliary verb), and complement.
However, a sentence can be classified into a simple sentence
(that contains a subject and a predicate, and it expresses a
complete thought), a compound sentence (that contains two
independent clauses joined by a coordinator), and a complex
sentence (which consists of an independent clause joined by
one or more dependent clauses). The snippets [4l-4n] show
simple structures consisting of a subject and a predicate. The
example [4o and 4p] highlights types of compound and com-
plex structures present in the corpus. Table 5 shows that the
use of fragmented and simple structures is common. The data
show 45% use of fragments followed by 44% use of simple
structure across the corpus; however, compound and complex
structures constituted relatively a low percentage. Chi-square
test of independence shows p value (.03), which is less than
.05; we can reject the null hypothesis, and say that types of
structures and languages are related. I have further explained
the association between types of structures and languages in
the following section.

p. <yeh dnt get me started on Morroco that and Tunisa is

Syntactic Reduction
As discussed above, structural properties of English were
found to be more susceptible to deletion. Nevertheless, the
participants were relatively diligent about structural proper-
ties of Urdu. Figure 1 indicates syntactic constituents, which
were regularly deleted. The structural properties of English,
for example, pronoun and verb, were more frequently deleted
than article, preposition, and inflection. Deletion of pronomi-
nal especially first person "I" was common. The participants
frequently deleted "I" where it was preceded by an auxiliary
"am." They occasionally truncated "I am" to "am" or "m" or
simply omitted "I," for example, . . . will do asap . . . m hav-
ing my exams!! . . . hope u understand!! . . . love you
mwaaaah. Insertion of three dots signifies deletion of pro-
noun "I." Similarly, they omitted auxiliary verbs, such as is,
are, am, was, and were in their conversations. Given the
structural deletion, there was omission of capitalization in
the beginning of an utterance or in the case of proper nouns
and addition of toggle case. As noted above, only a few

instances of cohesive ties were found across the corpus. As a
result of this, communication was more a reflection of short
structures then supported by linguistic nexuses. The omis-
sion of linguistic features shows that the participants might
have used their pragmatic knowledge to presuppose that the
receiver would know how to map out deleted expressions in
their utterances.
The snippets in [5] show that utterances, even though
shortened, are coherent and meaningful. Apart from obliga-
tory words, the participants omitted optional words by
assuming that obligatory words might be sufficient to express
meanings. However, the English language resists omission
of obligatory strings of words because they hold meaning
and omission may damage intelligibility. In my observation,
the deictic expressions, main verb, and attributive forms
seem sufficient for the projection of deleted string of words.
There is reason to believe that even though their communica-
tion was not structurally rich, concurrent exchanges revealed
somehow that the participants might have inferred the deleted
string of words for the success of communication. It is logi-
cal to argue that instead of structure, meaning was assumed
to be a primary source of carrying a message. How minimal
linguistic forms construe syntactic expression of mood and
overall relevant to the theory of meaning making is exam-
ined in the next section.

Figure 2 reflects a classification of commonly deleted
syntactic forms in the linguistic repertoire of Urdu/English
bilinguals. The sign {Ø} in the figure nuances for the
absence of a feature. As noted above, we did not find dele-
tion in grammatical features of the Urdu language apart
from superficial realization of Urdu graphemes. As shown
in the figure, it is the English language that seems to give
provision to deleting structural properties in digital dis-
course. It seems that the participants might have presup-
posed, of course to a certain extent, linguistic expressions
which were deleted regularly. There is a fair reason to
believe that the structural nativization of English is now
read in the local context as supported by Michael (1993). In
the next section, we will be concerned with the communi-
cative intention of the types of structures that we have
described in this section.
Syntactic Expression of Mood
In attempting to express themselves, the participants did not
only exchange utterances containing the set of rules, they also
performed structural moods. In many ways, they juxtaposed
linguistic features for the success of communication. For
instance, in [6a], imperative structure was used along with the
insertion of exclamatory tone to enquire. Similarly in [6b and
6c], declarative structure was used to enquire. In [6c], use of a

question mark at the boundary indicates that the participant
had intention to enquire. In [6d], the structure is interrogative
but the exclamation mark and comma seem to indicate the
intention. Thus, the structure alone may not be sufficient to
perceive the communicative function in digital discourse. The
subsequent discursive practices they carried out uncover a
success of their communication. They juxtaposed various lin-
guistic and extralinguistic features to choose functional roles
and to resolve a kind of ambiguity that may emerge as a result
of apparently a flexible relationship between structure and
function, for example, a statement can be read as a question or
vice versa (see, for example, Sinclair & Coulthard, 1978).
[6]
a. <Tell me abt it!> (Tell me about it!)
b.<Mje call pe btana Kal paper hai mera.> (Let me know
on phone . . . I have exam tomorrow.)
c. <Kal match on?> (. . . . . . game on tomorrow?)
d. <Phr kon dayta hay apko, clases,,?!> (Then, who does
teach you?)
Conclusion
This study pursued a descriptive approach to analyze the lin-
guistic repertoire of Urdu/English bilinguals to explain how
CMC works. The findings reveal that the participants are prone
to minimizing forms, apparently presupposed, in English and
Urdu. The data indicate that they tend to delete optional words
and segments more or less, which do not hide the base forms
for the projection of missing elements. While mapping out
minimal linguistic forms, we found unique configurations
which were equally rich in their semantic manifestation.
Despite the fact that the participants committed structural
irregularities in their communication, they adhered to gram-
matical rules and conversation principles to the extent that
their communication was intelligible. The elements which
were missed or omitted can be guessed at or perceived
because, while communicating, they were not only con-
cerned with just the structure of their message but with the
meaning and context surrounding the message, as supported
by Spears, Lea, and Postmes (2001). Perhaps meanings,
more than receiver or mode, directed their linguistic choices
as to how far they could manipulate the structure of English
and Urdu. They marked moods with the types of structures
we have discussed. Although we generally construe a mood
both through the transformation of a structure along with
insertion of punctuation marks, they did this simply by
inserting punctuation marks and avoiding structural transfor-
mation. Apart from structure, the discourse roles the partici-
pants technically assumed tend to contribute to the theory of
meaning in digital environment.
Unlike previous studies, which have revealed the ambiva-
lent, if not weird, nature of cyber-linguistic features, this study
helps define a broader classification of them, which suppos-
edly project some unique configurations. The study reveals
that even though Urdu and English are subject to morphologi-
cal and syntactic reduction, their structural manipulation in the
context of CMC does not obscure meaning. The study moti-
vates future researchers to investigate linguistic reduction to
reveal linguistic variation and change in the languages used
for the Internet communication. This would further provide us
with a foreground, so we can understand more about the lin-
guistic behavior and social identity of e-communities.
