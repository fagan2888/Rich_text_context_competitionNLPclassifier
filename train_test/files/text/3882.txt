The Volume-Quality Relationship in
Antibiotic Prescribing: When More Isn't
Better

Abstract
For many surgeries and high-risk medical conditions, higher volume providers provide higher quality care. The impact of
volume on more common medical conditions such as acute respiratory infections (ARIs) has not been examined. Using
electronic health record data for adult ambulatory ARI visits, we divided primary care physicians into ARI volume quintiles.
We fitted a linear regression model of antibiotic prescribing rates across quintiles to assess for a significant difference in
trend. Higher ARI volume physicians had lower quality across a number of domains, including higher antibiotic prescribing
rates, higher broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing, and lower guideline concordance. Physicians with a higher volume of
cases manage ARI very differently and are more likely to prescribe antibiotics. When they prescribe an antibiotic for a
diagnosis for which an antibiotic may be indicated, they are less likely to prescribe guideline-concordant antibiotics. Given
that high-volume physicians account for the bulk of ARI visits, efforts targeting this group are likely to yield important
population effects in improving quality.

Introduction
For surgeries and high-risk medical conditions, higher vol-
ume physicians, on average, provide higher quality of care.1
However, the impact of volume on more basic medical con-
ditions, where the acquisition of procedure- or diagnosis-
specific expertise may be less relevant, has not been
examined. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute
respiratory infections (ARIs) is common and leads to many
negative public health consequences including increased
antibiotic resistance, adverse drug reactions, and increased
cost.2 We examined whether primary care physicians who
see a higher volume of ARI visits provide higher quality of
care in terms of antibiotic prescribing.
Methods
We obtained electronic health record data for all 2012 adult
ambulatory visits for ARIs to primary care physicians in a
large integrated health system that was affiliated with an aca-
demic medical center. The health system is located in the
Northeastern United States, and operates more than 20 hospi-
tals and 400 outpatient sites. Based on prior work,3 we divided
ARI diagnoses (based on International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes) into 2
groups: (1) "antibiotic-appropriate diagnoses" (antibiotics
may be indicated), including streptococcal pharyngitis (034.x),
otitis media (381.x, 382.x), sinusitis (461.x), and pneumonia
(481.x, 482.x, 483.x, 485.x, 486.x), and (2) "non-antibiotic-
appropriate diagnoses" (antibiotics are never indicated),
including non-specific upper respiratory infection (URI;
460.x, 465.x), non-streptococcal pharyngitis (462.x), and
bronchitis (466.x, 490.x, 491.21). We identified oral antibiotic
prescriptions, and calculated the antibiotic prescribing rate for
the following: all ARI visits, individual conditions, non-
antibiotic-appropriate diagnoses, antibiotic-appropriate
diagnoses, guideline concordance (for antibiotic-appropriate

diagnoses only), and broad spectrum (across all visits at which
an antibiotic was prescribed). We defined guideline concor-
dance as antibiotic prescriptions for antibiotic-appropriate
diagnoses that were the first-line antibiotic recommended for
the specific condition based on national guidelines: amoxicil-
lin-clavulanate or amoxicillin for sinusitis,4,5 a macrolide or
doxycycline for pneumonia,6 amoxicillin or penicillin for
streptocccal pharyngitis,7,8 and amoxicillin for otitis media.9
We defined broad-spectrum antibiotics as macrolides, quino-
lones, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and second- and third-genera-
tion cephalosporins.10 We divided physicians into quintiles by
ARI visit volume and generated prescribing rates for each
quintile using average prescribing rates for clinicians. We fit-
ted a linear regression model of prescribing rates across quin-
tiles to assess for a significant difference in trend.
Results
During 2012, 685 clinicians had 31 973 ARI visits and the
overall antibiotic prescribing rate was 50%. For all ARI
cases, physicians in higher volume quintiles were more
likely to list an antibiotic-appropriate diagnosis versus a non-
antibiotic-appropriate diagnosis (P < .001; Table 1).
Physicians in higher volume quintiles had a higher antibiotic
prescribing rate across all ARI visits (P < .001; Table 1), for
non-antibiotic-appropriate ARI diagnoses (P < .001), for
antibiotic-appropriate ARI diagnoses, and for 4 individual
diagnoses: URI, bronchitis, non-streptococcal pharyngitis,
and sinusitis (all Ps < .001). Broad-spectrum antibiotic
prescribing increased significantly as volume increased (P =
.001), whereas guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing
decreased significantly (P < .001; Table 1).
Discussion
Physicians with a higher volume of cases manage ARI in a
very different manner. They are much more likely to list a
diagnosis where an antibiotic may be appropriate. However,
for both non-antibiotic-appropriate diagnoses and antibiotic-
appropriate diagnoses, higher volume physicians are more
likely to prescribe antibiotics. When they prescribe an antibi-
otic for a diagnosis for which an antibiotic may be indicated,
they are less likely to prescribe guideline-concordant antibi-
otics. In contrast to previous studies on the volume-outcome
relationship, for ARI visits, higher volume physicians appear
to provide lower quality care than lower volume physicians.
The relationship between volume and quality is generally
thought to be due to increasing physician experience leading
to better performance or decision making, which in turn can
lead to improved outcomes. However, in the case of ARI vis-
its, additional volume is unlikely to add substantively to the
physician's expertise. In fact, at a certain threshold, higher
volume may be associated with lower quality if physicians
are rushed. Lower volume might also be a proxy for part-
time status, which has been associated with higher quality.11
One key limitation of our study is that it relies on physician
diagnostic coding. Higher volume physicians may see a differ-
ent patient mix, but physicians have substantial discretion in
Gidengil et al 3
selecting specific ARI diagnoses. Also, antibiotic prescribing
is not always indicated for many visits even for "antibiotic-
appropriate" diagnoses.5 In addition, it is possible that physi-
cians who are more likely to prescribe are also simply more
likely to document diagnoses well, resulting in a systematic
reporting bias.
Another limitation is that we did not measure physicians'
overall visit volume or time spent with each patient, potential
markers of whether a physician is rushed. And finally, this is
a single health system study, which may constrain the gener-
alizability of our results more broadly.
Our results help inform efforts to identify targets for inter-
vention. Given that high-volume physicians account for the
bulk of ARI visits, efforts targeting this group are likely to
yield important population effects in improving quality.
