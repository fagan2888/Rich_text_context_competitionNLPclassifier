Abstract
In continuous flash suppression (CFS), a dynamic sequence of Mondrian patterns presented to one
eye suppresses a static target in the other eye for several seconds at a time. Its effectiveness has
been linked to low-level properties such as spatial frequency and orientation, but the role of higher
order influences remains unstudied. Here, using a tracking paradigm, we asked if the spatial and
temporal predictability of the Mondrian sequence affects CFS dynamics. Predictable temporal
sequences were regularly updated every 100 ms or modulated sinusoidally in pixel luminance at
2 Hz. Unpredictable temporal sequences were irregularly updated or had stochastic pixel
luminance changes across time. To vary spatial predictability, sequences were either updated
with different Mondrian patterns or had a fixed spatial pattern. We found a modest effect of
spatial uncertainty when the target modulation was low (0.125 Hz) but not temporal uncertainty,
which had no significant effects regardless of target modulation. Similar results were obtained
when we pitted the standard Mondrian sequence against sequences with a fixed spatial pattern and
temporally low-pass filtered sequences in a binocular rivalry paradigm. Thus, not only was the
effect of information predictability was modest and spatial, but it was also dependent on the
presence of higher temporal frequencies. Together, the results demonstrate the significance of
low-level properties in affecting CFS dynamics and the possible involvement of pattern structure
masking in CFS.

Introduction
Psychologists have long been intrigued by the possibility that important aspects of perception
and cognition could transpire outside of awareness (Driver & Mattingley, 1998; Pillai, 1939;
Sidis, 1898; Vuilleumier et al., 2002). To chart the boundaries of processing outside of awareness,
those of us who study perception exploit phenomena in which ordinarily detectable sensory
stimuli are rendered undetectable. In the case of vision, there are a number of phenomena
that entail just this characteristic and, thus, provide us with psychophysical tools for
rendering the ordinarily visible invisible (Breitmeyer, 2014; Kim & Blake, 2005). Among those
procedures for dissociating seeing and awareness are visual masking (Breitmeyer & Ogmen,
2000), motion-induced blindness (Bonneh, Cooperman, & Sagi, 2001), inattentional blindness
(Neisser & Becklen, 1975) and binocular rivalry (Alais, 2012; Blake, 2001).
Twelve years ago, two research groups (Fang & He, 2005; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005)
independently described a particularly potent means for rendering an interesting, complex
monocularly viewed stimulus invisible for many seconds at a time. Unlike binocular rivalry,
this variant of interocular suppression entails presenting an animation consisting of rapidly
changing series of geometric figures to one eye while simultaneously presenting a target
stimulus to the corresponding retinal area of the other eye. In the version created by Fang
and He, the successive animation frames comprised a random array of tiny squares, while the
version created by Tsuchiya and Koch comprised successively presented coloured rectangles
(a.k.a. Mondrians). With either configuration, the result was almost always immediate and
relatively prolonged suppression of the target by the dynamic series of images, leading
Tsuchiya and Koch to dub the technique continuous flash suppression (CFS). This
compelling form of interocular suppression quickly caught the imagination of vision
scientists interested in perceptual processing outside of awareness, spawning a slew of
psychophysical papers utilising CFS to address that topic (see reviews by Gayet, Van der
Stigchel, & Paffen, 2014; Sterzer, Stein, Ludwig, Rothkirch, & Hesselmann, 2014; Yang,
Brascamp, Kang, & Blake, 2014). In addition, human brain imaging studies have deployed
CFS to study the mode of action of CFS on neural activity within visual cortex (Watanabe
et al., 2011; Yamashiro et al., 2014; Yuval-Greenberg & Heeger, 2013).
One lesson growing out of all of this work is an appreciation that CFS does not work with
equal effectiveness for all participants (e.g., see the series of studies by Sklar et al., 2012,
where results from up to 50% of participants had to be omitted because of insufficient depth
of CFS suppression). As Vadillo, Konstantinidis, and Shanks (2016) have argued, this kind of
rejection of false-positive data raises statistical issues that can compromise conclusions from
studies on unconscious processing. One way to minimise the problem is to use calibration
procedures to establish CFS and target parameters that produce uniform depth of
suppression among all participants (see Han & Alais, 2018; Hesselmann, Darcy, Rothkirch,
& Sterzer, in press). At the same time, it is important to establish the boundary conditions
governing the maximum effectiveness of CFS. To date, the majority of investigations utilising
CFS have employed variants of the configurations introduced by Fang and He (2005) and
Tsuchiya and Koch (2005), namely a dynamic mask consisting of an ever-changing stream of
texture arrays flashed one after the other at a rate of 10 frames/second (10 Hz).
On the belief that good workers benefit from understanding their tools, we and others have
endeavoured to explore factors that contribute to the effectiveness of CFS. Thus, it is now known
that CFS potency varies with the spatial frequency of the masker (Willenbockel, Lepore, Nguyen,
Bouthillier, & Gosselin, 2012; Yang & Blake, 2012), the contrast of the masker (Han, Lunghi, &
Alais, 2016; Ledgeway, McGraw & Thompson, 2013; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005), the update rate of
the masker (Zhu, Drewes, & Melcher, 2016) and the temporal frequency content of the masker
(Han, Blake & Alais, 2018; Han et al., 2016). Previous CFS-masked priming experiments also
2 i-Perception 9(4)
reported shorter response times to tool probes when elongated prime stimuli were used (Almeida
et al., 2014), but these results might have been partially influenced by image leakages in anaglyph
glasses and response time variability to the different probe stimuli (Hesselmann, Darcy, Rothkirch,
& Sterzer, 2018). Another factor impacting CFS potency is repeated testing: The strength of
suppression tends to wane with repeated testing, as evidenced by the propensity for a target to
breach CFS suppression earlier and earlier over repeated trials (Blake, Goodman, Tomarken, &
Kim, in preparation; Ludwig, Sterzer, Kathmann, Franz, & Hesselmann, 2013). This latter
observation led us to wonder whether the predictability of the dynamics of the CFS sequence
might have an impact on the strength of CFS, and this is the idea tested in the experiments
described in this article.
The present study was inspired by the concept of entropy (Shannon, 1948), as it has been
applied to other aspects of visual perception (e.g., see Gilden, Hiris, & Blake, 1995; Lee,
Blake, & Lee, 2009). Expressed mathematically, entropy is a quantity related to the Poisson
rate parameter associated with a given time series. In simple terms, entropy is an expression
of predictability, where successive events unfolding regularly over time have low entropy,
whereas successive events occurring irregularly have higher values of entropy. The entropy
value would depend on the number of alternative random event states and their relative
probabilities, but as rule of thumb, entropy is inversely proportional to predictability.
Viewed within an entropy framework, the commonly used CFS masking stimulus of a
series of random spatial Mondrian patterns presented at a rate of 10 Hz has low entropy
in the temporal domain, as changes will occur predictably every 100 ms, and high entropy in
the spatial domain, as each new Mondrian pattern in the sequence is random and unrelated
to its predecessor. In this study, we have examined the consequences of manipulating
temporal and spatial entropy on the potency of CFS, as assessed by its suppression of a
contralateral bullseye target over a 1-minute viewing period. This allowed us to measure the
initial strength of suppression as typically recorded in breaking-CFS studies (Jiang, Costello,
& He, 2007; Moors, Wagemans, & De-Wit, 2014; Yang, Zald, & Blake, 2007) and to
characterise masker effectiveness over a longer period of time. All experiments described in
this study adopted a dominance tracking paradigm that is used in previous CFS (Tsuchiya &
Koch, 2005; Yamashiro et al., 2014) and rivalry studies (Alais, Cass, Shea, & Blake, 2010;
Andrews & Blakemore, 2002; Brascamp, van Eee, Noest, Jacobs, & van den Berg, 2006;
Dieter, Melnick, & Tadin, 2015; Kang, 2009; Parker & Alais, 2007).
Experiments 1 and 2: The Regularity of Pattern Changes
These experiments asked if the regularity of Mondrian pattern changes affects the dynamics
of CFS. As shown in Figure 1(a), two types of temporal schedules were compared in
Experiment 1: Regular pattern updates every 100 ms or irregular pattern update periods
varying around an average of 100 ms. These temporal schedules were then temporally low-
pass filtered (<4 Hz) and compared in Experiment 2. This was to ascertain the influence of
temporal irregularity, as the irregular update schedule contained longer periods of stationary
patterns that could potentially weaken suppression through increased neural adaptation
(Alais et al., 2010). By low-pass filtering the temporal schedules, we retained the
occurrence of pattern changes but standardised the dominant temporal frequency content
(Han et al., 2016, 2018), while producing a continuously varying pixel luminance timeline.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Recruitment and testing were conducted in the University of Sydney and
Vanderbilt University. As we were interested in evaluating the practical usefulness of

Figure 1. Stimuli used in this study. (a) Presentation schedules used in Experiments 1 and 2. Patterns were
updated regularly every 100 ms or at irregular intervals (i.e., 40 ms, 80ms, 120 ms and 160 ms, averaging
100 ms). The original temporally unfiltered sequences were used in Experiment 1, whereas the sequences were
temporally low-pass filtered in Experiment 2. (b) Maskers used in Experiments 3 and 4. Three types of maskers
were used to produce different degrees of spatial and temporal entropy. The standard masker was updated with
a different pattern every 100 ms, meaning that it had random luminance and spatial pattern profiles (i.e., high
spatial and temporal entropy). The fixed masker was a single pattern sequence that had the same temporal
timeline as the standard masker, and as such, had low spatial entropy. The sine masker was also a single pattern
sequence, with the exception that it modulated regularly (and more predictably than the fixed masker) at 2 Hz.
(c) Maskers used in Experiment 5. The Standard and Fixed sequences from Experiments 3 and 4 were pitted
against temporally low-pass filtered Mondrian sequences in rivalry paradigm. The patterns were composed of
rectangles instead of squares. (d) Stimulus presentation for each trial. For Experiments 1 to 4, each trial begins
with a 30-s adaptation phase of spatial noise composed of 0.5 by 0.5 squares, followed by the dichoptic
presentation of a Mondrian sequence and a 1 cycle per degree, grey scale bullseye target. For Experiment 5,
however, the target was replaced by a Mondrian sequence. Participants were asked to track the appearance of
the target (Experiments 1­4) or the perceptual dominance of either Mondrian sequence (Experiment 5). All
visual stimuli were enclosed with a fusion frame, which is shown to both eyes to encourage binocular fusion.
The presentation of the visual stimuli was fixed within a trial but randomised between eyes across trials.

entropy in providing effective interocular suppression, we determined our sample size based
on previous work, where the estimated effect sizes with 7 to 11 participants were 0.55 to 0.84
using partial eta-squared (Han et al., 2016). Thus, a total of 11 participants were recruited for
Experiment 1, of which 8 of them (5 females), including two of the authors (R. B. and S. H.),
also took part in Experiment 2. Two other participants (one female) only participated in
Experiment 2, giving a total of 10 participants in Experiment 2. All participants had normal
or corrected-to-normal eyesight, and tested normal for stereovision, with the Randot Stereo
Test or the Fly Stereo Acuity Test. Experiments accorded with the Declaration of Helsinki
and were approved by the institutional review board of the University of Sydney and
Vanderbilt University. All participants provided informed consent and were reimbursed
for their time.
Visual stimuli. Masker stimuli were dynamic sequences of randomly generated 4 by 4 grey
scale Mondrian pattern images composed of squares ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 in length.
These sequences were updated in a temporally regular or irregular manner. Temporally
regular sequences in Experiment 1 were updated every 100 ms, whereas irregular sequences
were updated at intervals randomly selected from a pre-determined set of temporal intervals
of 40, 80, 120 and 160 ms (averaging 100 ms; Figure 1(a)). For Experiment 2, these sequences
were temporally low-pass filtered in frequency space. A three-dimensional fast Fourier
transform was first performed on each pattern sequence, followed by the application of a
low-pass temporal filter (<4 Hz) to the amplitude spectrum in the temporal dimension, with
no manipulation of the orthogonal spatial dimensions. The filtered spectral components were
then back-transformed to image space. In each trial, the Mondrian sequence lasted 60 s,
had a root mean square (RMS) contrast of approximately 20% and was normalised to mean
luminance.
The target was a two-dimensional bullseye (Figure 1(b)), generated by computing a
concentric sinusoidal grating with a spatial frequency of 1 cycle per degree and a radius of
3.3 visual angle. To avoid afterimages in the suppressed eye (Gilroy & Blake, 2005), the
target was phase modulated at a rate of 0.125 Hz throughout the duration of dichoptic
stimulation for each trial. During the experiment, the target was presented at 30% of
maximum contrast, and the masker was set to full RMS contrast. These values were
subjectively adjusted for two participants, who reported no target breakthrough with the
aforementioned settings. Higher bullseye contrasts were used for these participants as a
result. To encourage stable fusion, a fusion frame with an internal width of 4 and an
external length of 6.5 was used to enclose all visual stimuli. Visual stimuli were displayed
to participants using a ViewSonic PS225f or Triniton Dell CRT monitor (resolution
1024 Â 768 pixels for both) at the University of Sydney, and a Sony GDM-F90 CRT
monitor (resolution 800 Â 600 pixels) was used at Vanderbilt University. All visual
displays were gamma-corrected and had a screen rate of 100 Hz.
Procedure. Participants viewed the stimuli through a mirror stereoscope. To ensure that the
dichoptic images were fused, each individual first completed a calibration task where the
perceived spatial positions of two 4 by 4 by 0.3 thick square frames were aligned using key
presses to nudge the location of one of them vertically or horizontally. Following that,
participants commenced the CFS task. Each trial began with a prompt to initiate stimulus
presentation with a key press, after which participants were adapted to a 30 s sequence of
noise images (composed of 0.5 by 0.5 squares, normalised to mean luminance: see Figure 1).
Post-adaptation, the masker was presented at the same contrast as in adaptation, whereas the
target's contrast was gradually increased to the preset target contrast over a period of 800 ms.
Han et al. 5
Both target and masker were presented on the screen for 60 s, during which participants were
asked to press a key when any part of the target became visible and to hold it down for as
long as it remained visible. Each trial thus provided the respective dominance durations of
the Mondrian masker and the target, and the number of target breakthroughs.
All participants were instructed to fixate on the central cross throughout the duration of
each trial and were given ample practice to familiarise with the task demands. To avoid inter-
trial effects between the experimental conditions, the effects of irregular and regular pattern
update schedules were tested in counterbalanced blocks. Each block consisted of four trials
that were counterbalanced for the eye of presentation (i.e., each eye received the masker two
times in each block). Each individual thus completed a total of eight trials (four for each eye)
for each condition.
Analysis. Three dependent measures were computed from each individual's data set, namely,
the time to first target breakthrough, the average number of target breakthroughs and
masker predominance. Prior to computing the dependent measures, the dominance
durations of the Mondrian masker were first normalised to the overall average duration.
We then extracted the normalised time to first target breakthrough (henceforth referred to as
normalised suppression duration) and computed the average for each condition. This was
synonymous with the time to visibility measured in previous breaking-CFS studies (e.g., Jiang
et al., 2007) and reflected the strength of the initial suppression. The average number of target
breakthroughs and average masker predominance reflected the overall masker effectiveness
over the course of the trial. For each condition, we computed the average number of target
breakthroughs and averaged masker predominance, defined as the total proportion of
viewing time in a trial where the Mondrian was perceptually dominant (see also Brascamp,
Klink, & Levelt, 2015). Individual data points were plotted for all dependent measures and
were also summarised with the median and median absolute deviation of the between-
subjects data points (see Figure 2). Pairwise comparisons were conducted with the non-
parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test computed using the Hollander and Wolfe (1973)
method in the statistical program R (R Core Team, 2017). This method uses the
parameter V, which is obtained by first computing the difference between the data
compared, and then summing the ranks assigned to positive differences.
Results
The results of Experiments 1 and 2 are summarised in Figure 2(a) and (b), respectively.
Individual data points, each representing the average normalised suppression duration
(left panels of Figure 2), average number of target breakthroughs or average masker
predominance of each participant, are plotted for both experiments. Given the variability
in individual data points, the median was used to represent the central tendencies of the
different dependent measures. As shown in Figure 2(a), manipulating the temporal regularity
of pattern updates in Experiment 1 produced comparable normalised suppression durations,
masker predominance and number of target breakthroughs. The same conclusions are also
reflected statistically, where we obtained no significant differences in normalised suppression
durations, V ¼ 21, p ¼ .32, masker predominance, V ¼ 43, p ¼ .41 and number of target
breakthroughs, V ¼ 35.5, p ¼ .41 (corrected for continuity).
Similarly, in Experiment 2, low-pass filtered regular and irregular pattern sequences
produced comparable normalised suppression durations, masker predominance and target
breakthrough frequencies (Figure 2(b)). Despite controlling for differences in temporal frequency
content, pattern update regularity did not significantly affect the initial breakthrough time of
6 i-Perception 9(4)
CFS, V ¼ 33, p¼ .63. In addition, update regularity did not have a significant influence on the
overall masker effectiveness over prolonged periods of time, V¼ 37, p¼ .38. Similarly, the
number of target breakthroughs was also not significantly different between the two types of
pattern sequences, V¼ 10, p¼ .16 (corrected for continuity).
Discussion for Experiments 1 and 2
In Experiments 1 and 2, we varied the regularity of pattern updates to learn whether
difference in temporal entropy has an effect on CFS effectiveness. Irregular and regular
update schedules were compared in Experiment 1, and the comparison was repeated with
temporally low-pass filtered schedules in Experiment 2. Three dependent measures were
collected, namely, the time to first target breakthrough, number of target breakthroughs
and masker predominance. Initial breakthrough times were synonymous with previous
breaking-CFS studies (e.g., Jiang et al., 2007) and reflected the effectiveness of the initial
Figure 2. Results of Experiments 1 and 2. From left to right, the three panels show results for the average
normalised time to the first target breakthrough, average number of target breakthroughs and average
masker predominance. (a) Experiment 1: results for unfiltered Mondrians. The distributions of individual data
points, the median and the median absolute deviation (denoted by error bars) were plotted. None of the
dependent measures was significantly influenced by the regularity of pattern update, as the data sets for both
types of pattern update had comparable medians and considerable variability. (b) Experiment 2: results for
low-pass filtered Mondrians. Similar to Experiment 1, the data sets for both types of update schedules have
considerable variability and comparable medians and do not differ on any of the dependent measures. These
results indicate that the regularity of pattern update has no effect on CFS dynamics, and that the lack of
significant effects is not confounded by neural adaptation, which conceivably could have played a stronger role
in the temporally unfiltered, irregular update schedule.

suppression. On the other hand, the average number of target breakthroughs and masker
predominance tapped into the effectiveness of suppression over a prolonged period of time.
Our results showed that in neither experiment did pattern update regularity have a significant
effect on any of the three dependent measures.
One possible reason for the absence of an effect of entropy was that the irregular and
regular pattern update schedules had different temporal frequency content. We doubt this
was the case, as Fourier analyses revealed comparable temporal frequency content between
the two types of schedules in Experiment 1 (Figure 3(a)). Moreover, similar results were
obtained when the temporally low-pass filtered maskers were used in Experiment 2.
Instead, it seemed more likely that our manipulation of entropy was inadequate,
producing perhaps a subtle change in predictability that was easily obscured by subjective
sources of variability such as participant decisional criteria (Yang et al., 2014). Figure 3(b)
illustrates this point. Each pattern update in the Mondrian masker was accompanied by
changes in spatiotemporal information. With every new pattern, spatial elements of the
Mondrian masker vary in location, contour shapes and size (Figure 3(b), upper panel).
Temporal changes were also stochastic, though more predictable than spatial changes
as the differences in luminance between patterns tended to be of a smaller magnitude
(Figure 3(b), lower panel). By influencing the temporal dimension with variations in the
update schedules in Experiments 1 and 2, we ignored a potentially important source of
information entropy. Instead, we varied a dimension that had more predictable outcomes.
Figure 3. Properties of the Mondrian maskers. (a) The effect of pattern update regularity on the temporal
frequency spectrum of the Mondrian masker. Amplitude spectra shown were obtained by conducting a one-
dimensional fast Fourier transform on pixel timelines of the irregular and regular Mondrian sequences. Both
types of sequences have a characteristic 1/f profile, which were comparable in low (<4 Hz) and high (>4 Hz)
frequency content, assessed with the average area under the curve estimated from 10 independently drawn
pixel timelines. (b) Spatial and temporal entropy in the Mondrian masker. As shown in the upper panel, spatial
changes between patterns were unpredictable, varying in luminance, size and configuration for a given patch
of pixels in the Mondrian masker. On the other hand, temporal entropy (lower panel) was limited by the
normal distribution of luminance changes between pattern updates, as most pixel changes were of a smaller
magnitude.
8 i-Perception 9(4)
In the following experiments, we adopted a more comprehensive definition of entropy that
involves both the spatial and temporal domains.
Experiments 3 and 4: The Effect of Spatiotemporal Entropy
Experiments 1 and 2 failed to yield any conclusive evidence regarding the effect of temporal
regularity on the dynamics of CFS, leading us to wonder whether our manipulation of
entropy was adequate. We thus defined predictability more comprehensively in
Experiments 3 and 4, this time focusing on changes in spatial patterns and pixel
luminance. Three types of maskers were compared, namely, a standard 10 Hz Mondrian
masker (Standard), a single Mondrian pattern that modulated in luminance sinusoidally at
2 Hz (Sine) or had pixel luminance timelines extracted from a regular Mondrian (Fixed). Of
these maskers, the standard masker had the highest spatial and temporal uncertainty and
therefore the highest entropy in both dimensions. The sine masker, given the use of the single
pattern and periodic changes in luminance, had the lowest spatial and temporal uncertainty
and thus lowest entropy. The predictability of the fixed masker lay in between, as it had low
spatial entropy but with the same stochastic changes in luminance as the standard masker.
For the target stimulus, we chose a phase modulation rate of 0.125 Hz in Experiment 3 and a
rate of 4 Hz in Experiment 4. These values were chosen because the slower target rate was a
better match to temporal frequency content of all three types of maskers (i.e., 2 Hz sine
maskers and 1/f spectrum for the standard and fixed maskers), allowing us to test if
entropy provides a suppressive advantage beyond that of temporal frequency selectivity
(Han & Alais, 2018). Given that pixel luminance changes between Mondrian patterns
tended to cluster around smaller magnitudes in the standard masker, as shown in the
lower panel of Figure 3(b), we expected the manipulation of spatial entropy to have a
larger effect on suppression, for both temporally similar and dissimilar targets.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Recruitment and testing were conducted in the University of Sydney and
Vanderbilt University. The required sample size was determined using the same criteria as
Experiments 1 and 2. Five participants (four females), including author S. H., participated in
Experiments 3 and 4. Six other participants (three females) only took part in Experiment 3,
and another five participants (three females) only participated in Experiment 4. All
participants had normal or corrected-to-normal eyesight, and tested normal for
stereovision, with the Randot Stereo Test or the Fly Stereo Acuity Test. Experiments
accorded with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the institutional review
boards of the University of Sydney and of Vanderbilt University. All participants provided
informed consent and were reimbursed for their time.
Visual stimuli. Three types of masker stimuli were used in Experiments 3 and 4. They were
dynamic sequences of Mondrian patterns (Standard) that were updated every 100 ms, single
Mondrian patterns that modulated in luminance sinusoidally at 2 Hz (Sine) or single
Mondrian patterns that had the same pixel luminance timeline as the Standard Mondrian
sequence (Fixed). All Mondrian patterns used in these experiments were grey scale, 4 by 4
in size and composed of squares ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 in length. As in the previous
experiments, each sequence lasted for 60 s in each trial, had a RMS contrast of
approximately 20% and was normalised to mean luminance. The bullseye target from
Experiments 1 and 2 was used in Experiments 3 and 4, with the exception that the target
Han et al. 9
was presented at a lower contrast (20% instead of 30% of maximum RMS contrast) and
phase-modulated at a rate of 4 Hz in Experiment 4. All visual stimuli were enclosed with
frames measuring of 4 internally and 6.5 externally to encourage stable fusion. The same
display apparatuses from Experiments 1 and 2 were used to present the visual stimuli.
Procedure. The same procedures from Experiments 1 and 2 were used in Experiments 3 and 4.
Analysis. The data sets were prepared in the same manner as in Experiments 1 and 2.
Similarly, non-parametric statistical approaches such as Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and
Friedman tests were used to assess pairwise comparisons and main effects, respectively.
Results
The results of Experiments 3 and 4 are illustrated in Figure 4. As in the previous experiments,
individual data points are plotted to show the average normalised suppression duration,
average masker predominance and average number of target breakthroughs for each
participant. Central tendencies of each dependent measure are also represented by the
respective medians. As shown in Figure 4(a), fixed maskers produced lower masker
predominance and normalised suppression durations than the sine and standard maskers.
Normalised suppression durations were approximately 10% to 30% lower, and the fixed
masker dominated approximately 11% less amount of viewing time than the other two
maskers. The number of target breakthroughs, however, was comparable across all three
maskers. These observations were assessed with the Friedman test, a non-parametric version
of the one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. The results reveal no significant main
effects of masker type on normalised suppression durations and number of target
breakthroughs, 2(2) ¼ 5, p ¼ .08 and 2(2) ¼ 3, p ¼ .22, respectively. However, masker type
did affect masker predominance significantly, 2(2) ¼ 7.8, p ¼ .02. The effect of masker type
on masker predominance was assessed using Holm-Bonferroni corrected Wilcoxon signed-
rank tests. We found that the presence of uncertain spatial information in the standard
masker produced a significantly higher predominance than the fixed masker, V ¼ 51,
p ¼ .03, but the effect seemed contingent on the use of the stepped timeline in the fixed
masker. This was because the predominance of the sine and standard maskers were
statistically no different, V ¼ 32, p ¼ .70. In addition, the sine masker had a significantly
higher predominance than the fixed masker, V ¼ 5, p ¼ .02, even though the latter had a
broader temporal frequency spectrum.
The results of Experiment 3 suggest a modest effect of spatial entropy on masker
predominance, which we tested with a less compatible, 4 Hz target in Experiment 4.
Figure 4(b) shows that the median masker predominance is approximately 7% higher for
the standard masker than the other two maskers. However, compared with Experiment 3
(Figure 4(a)), the distribution of individual data points for masker predominance is
noticeably more variable across all three maskers. For normalised suppression durations,
suppression was approximately 40% longer when the standard masker was used. Compared
with the sine and standard maskers, target breakthroughs were approximately 14% higher
when the fixed masker was presented. None of these observations is statistically significant.
Masker type did not affect the normalised suppression duration, 2(2) ¼ 3.8, p ¼ .15, and had
no significant effect on target breakthrough frequency, 2(2) ¼ 4.7, p ¼ .10. Despite the presence
of both spatial and temporal entropy in the standard masker, masker type had no significant
effect on masker predominance, 2(2) ¼ 4.2, p ¼ .12. Thus, the effect of spatial entropy appears
to depend on the presence of compatible target or masker temporal frequency content.

Discussion for Experiments 3 and 4
We had reasoned that our manipulation of entropy in Experiments 1 and 2 might have been
too simplified in focusing only on the temporal dimension. Thus, in Experiments 3 and 4, we
adopted a broader manipulation of entropy, taking into account the predictability of the
spatial and temporal content. Three types of Mondrian maskers were used, namely, the
standard 10 Hz Mondrian pattern sequences (Standard), single Mondrian pattern maskers
with the same pixel luminance timeline as the standard Mondrian (Fixed) and single patterns
that modulated sinusoidally in luminance at 2 Hz (Sine). To assess the extent of any possible
effects of entropy, target rates that were similar to the maskers (0.125 Hz, Experiment 3) and
dissimilar to the maskers (4 Hz, Experiment 4) were used. Because pixel luminance changes
between Mondrian patterns tended to be of a smaller magnitude (Figure 3(c)), we expected
spatial entropy to have a larger effect on suppression than temporal entropy, regardless of the
Figure 4. Results of Experiments 3 and 4. From left to right, the three panels show results for the
normalised time to the first target breakthrough, average number of target breakthrough and masker
predominance. (a) Experiment 3: the effect of spatial and temporal entropy on the suppression of a 0.125 Hz
target. The bar graphs represent the distributions of data points, the median and the median absolute
deviation (denoted by error bars). The average number of target breakthroughs and normalised suppression
durations was not significantly influenced by the regularity of pattern update, as the data sets for both types of
pattern update had comparable medians and considerable variability. On the other hand, the predominance of
the fixed masker was significantly lower than that of the sine and standard maskers. As there was no
significant difference between the sine and standard maskers, the predominance results demonstrate the
importance of spatial entropy in stepped timelines. (b) Experiment 4: the effect of spatial and temporal
entropy on the suppression of a 4 Hz target. Although the standard masker produced slightly longer
normalised times to first target breakthrough and larger masker predominance than the other two maskers,
none of the dependent measures was significantly affected by entropy. Error bars represent the median
absolute deviation of individual data points.

target modulation rate. Although we did find a significantly larger predominance for the
standard masker than the fixed masker in Experiment 3, performance was comparable
between standard and sine maskers, indicating that the effect was limited to maskers with
stepped timelines. This weak influence of entropy was further demonstrated in Experiment 4,
where the use of the less compatible, 4 Hz target resulted in a null result for all three
dependent measures. Together, the results of Experiments 3 and 4 did not support a
substantial influence of entropy in CFS.
Differences in individual contrast sensitivity and decisional criteria in determining target
visibility (Yang et al., 2014) might have contributed to the variability in the data, reducing
statistical power as a result. Also, it is possible that the extent to which entropy affects CFS
could be better estimated by measuring suppression depth or target contrast thresholds over
time. However, we have observed that comparisons of contrast thresholds and suppression
durations in CFS show a high correlation (Han & Alais, 2018), and we conclude it is more
likely for weaker effects to be obscured by between-subject variability. Instead, lower level
factors seemed to have a larger influence on CFS than entropy. To elaborate, periods of
constant illumination in a masker with a stepped update schedule meant that the fixed and
standard maskers were more susceptible to neural adaptation. As mentioned earlier,
increasing neural adaptation weakens interocular suppression (Alais et al., 2010).
Thus, any loss in suppressive strength over prolonged periods of time might have been
partially compensated by the presence of spatial uncertainty in the standard masker. With
a continuously varying luminance timeline, such compensation was not necessary for the sine
masker, explaining why the standard and sine maskers were comparable in performance in
Experiment 3. In addition, since the 4 Hz target in Experiment 4 was temporally less
compatible to all three maskers, the failure to observe a significant effect of spatial entropy
in Experiment 4 underscores the weak influence of spatial entropy and the importance of low-
level factors such temporal frequency selectivity compared with spatial entropy.
Previous studies have suggested the involvement of adaptation (Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005)
and feature selectivity in CFS (Han & Alais, 2018; Moors et al., 2014; Yang & Blake, 2012;
but see Ananyev, Penney, & Hsieh, 2017), and it was not surprising that these factors might
contribute to our results. More interestingly, was the nature in which spatial entropy
contributed to CFS. As the effect of spatial entropy was limited to the use of stepped
pattern presentation schedules, one possible mechanism was pattern structure masking.
To expand on this point, masking effectiveness was reported to increase with shorter
temporal intervals (Enns & Di Lollo, 2000) and sharp temporal onsets (Macknik,
Martinez-Conde, & Haglund, 2000). The transient, unpredictable phase congruency
changes in the standard masker fit this bill, suggesting that the effect of spatial entropy
was probably dependent on the presence of higher temporal frequencies. In the absence of
higher temporal frequencies (e.g., sine masker), spatial entropy was not particularly
important in CFS and vice versa (e.g., fixed masker). Alternatively, the apparent link
between spatial entropy and higher temporal frequencies might be a consequence of our
CFS stimulus choices. In common with most CFS studies, our stimuli involved a high-
contrast masker and a low-contrast target, resulting in a significant imbalance of stimulus
strength between the two eyes. The imbalance in contrast has been shown to be crucial to
CFS suppression (Han et al., 2016; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005), and combined with other low-
level influences such as feature selectivity, any contributions from entropy on the CFS
process might have been limited by the strong existing suppression of the target. Thus,
instead of a relationship between spatial entropy and temporal frequency content, the
effect of spatial entropy might have been more easily revealed in the stepped schedules
because of greater adaptation. Finally, a third possibility was that entropy had a weak
12 i-Perception 9(4)
influence on interocular suppression and would remain so regardless of the distribution of
stimulus strength between the eyes. To tease apart these possibilities, we would have to
eliminate the imbalance in contrast, and one way to do so would be to have the maskers
compete directly in a binocular rivalry paradigm.
Experiment 5: Boxing Match Between Mondrian Contenders
Experiments 3 and 4 revealed a measurable, albeit modest, influence of spatial entropy on
CFS suppression strength that was limited to the use of stepped presentation schedules. As
the stepped pattern presentations (i.e., fixed and standard maskers) had 1/f, broadband
temporal frequency spectrums (cf. Figure 3 and Han et al., 2016), the results suggested a
relationship between spatial entropy and the low energy, higher temporal frequency content.
Here, we examined this relationship by pitting three pairings of standard, fixed and low-pass
filtered ( < 4 Hz) Mondrian sequences against each other in a rivalry paradigm. By
determining which sequence would be perceptually dominant, this approach allowed us to
re-examine the effect of entropy in the absence of the contrast imbalance typically used in
CFS studies (e.g., Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005; Yang & Blake, 2012). Second, evaluating the
effectiveness of the maskers against each other was a more direct way of assessing entropy's
role in interocular suppression. Third, as the low-pass sequence retained spatial entropy,
pitting the continuously varying low-pass filtered Mondrian sequence against the fixed and
standard sequences allowed us to test the relationship between spatial entropy and higher
temporal frequencies. To draw a light-hearted analogy, the rivalry task was colloquially
referred to as a boxing match. Since there were three combinations of competing
Mondrian sequences (i.e., standard vs. fixed, standard vs. low-pass and fixed vs. low-pass),
a total of three matches were conducted in Experiment 5. Examples of the different Mondrian
sequences are provided (see movies: Vertical Standard, Vertical Fixed and Vertical Low-Pass).
Perceptual judgments were only possible if the competing maskers were discriminable. We
thus generated Mondrian pattern sequences composed of either horizontal or vertical
rectangles. During the experiment, the orientation of each sequence was presented
orthogonally to the competing sequence in the other eye. Assuming that the results in
Experiments 3 and 4 did reflect pattern structure masking, we predicted that spatial
entropy should have a larger effect on rivalling dynamics when it is paired with higher
temporal frequency content. Thus, when pitted against either the low-pass or fixed
sequence, the standard sequence was expected to dominate the boxing match. In contrast,
rivalling the fixed and low-pass sequences were expected to produce a draw, since neither
sequence contained rapidly varying pattern contours and shapes.
Materials and Methods
Participants. Recruitment and testing were conducted at the University of Sydney and
Vanderbilt University. The required sample size was determined using the same criteria as
the previous experiments. Seven participants (five females) participated in Experiment 5. All
participants had normal or corrected-to-normal eyesight, and tested normal for stereovision,
with the Randot Stereo Test or the Fly Stereo Acuity Test. Experiments accorded with the
Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the institutional review board of Vanderbilt
University. All participants provided informed consent and were reimbursed for their time.
Visual stimuli. Each Mondrian pattern was made up of horizontally or vertically oriented
rectangles ranging from 0.47 to 0.70 in width and 1.41 to 2.34 in height. All patterns
Han et al. 13
were grey scale and measured 4 by 4 in size. The standard and fixed Mondrian sequences
were generated with the same procedure as Experiments 3 and 4, and the low-pass sequence
was generated using the same low-pass filtering procedure used in Experiment 2. All
Mondrian sequences were set to maximum contrast (RMS ¼ 25%), normalised to mean
luminance and were presented equally in both orientations. To produce binocular rivalry,
we ensured there was always an interocular spatial conflict by presenting the vertical
rectangles to one eye and the horizontal rectangles to the other. As in previous
experiments, all visual stimuli were enclosed with frames measuring of 4 internally and
6.1 externally to encourage stable fusion. The same display apparatus from Vanderbilt
University was used to present the visual stimuli.
Procedure. The procedures followed in Experiment 5 were largely similar to the previous
experiments, with the exception that the rivalling stimuli were presented for 90 s instead of
60 s. Participants pressed the left arrow key while they saw a horizontal rivalling stimulus,
and the right arrow key while they saw the vertically oriented stimulus. Each trial thus
provided the respective dominance durations of each Mondrian sequence and the number
of alternations. Periods of piecemeal rivalry were not recorded. As with the previous
experiments, participants were instructed to maintain fixation on the centre cross
throughout the duration of each trial and were given ample practice to familiarise with the
task demands. To avoid inter-trial effects between the experimental conditions, each pair of
competing Mondrian patterns was presented in counterbalanced blocks. The pairs presented
were the standard and fixed sequences, the standard and low-pass sequences or the fixed and
low-pass sequences. Each block consisted of four trials that were counterbalanced for the eye
of presentation (i.e., each eye received each sequence twice in each block). Each individual
thus completed a total of eight trials (four for each eye) for each condition.
Analysis. Each boxing match involved rivalling a specific pair of Mondrian sequences (e.g.,
low-pass vs. fixed or standard vs. fixed). Thus, the winning Mondrian sequence of a specific
match was determined by its overall predominance and mean dominance duration across all
trials. Prior to computing these dependent measures, we normalised the dominance durations
of each Mondrian sequence to the average dominance duration of each match. As in the
previous experiments, we determined a sequence's predominance for each trial by computing
the proportion of its dominance out of the total viewing time. The respective predominance
values were then averaged across trials and compared against the competing sequence using
the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Similarly, mean dominance durations were computed for each
trial and then averaged across trials for each competing sequence. To compare the dynamics
of each match, the number of perceptual alternations of each match was averaged across
trials and statistically assessed with the Friedman's test. Finally, as the human sensitivity to
horizontal and vertical lengths has been reported to differ (Gottsdanker & Tietz, 1992), we
compared the predominance and mean dominance durations of vertically and horizontally
oriented sequences.
Results
The predominance and mean dominance duration results of each match are summarised in
Figure 5. As in the previous experiments, individual data points representing the average
predominance and mean dominance duration for each participant are shown for all three
matches. Figure 5(a) reveals that the standard Mondrian sequence dominated perception for
a larger proportion of the viewing time than the low-pass and fixed sequences, that is, 14%
14 i-Perception 9(4)
and 30% higher in median predominance, respectively. On the other hand, when low-pass and
fixed sequences were pitted against each other, both sequences dominated comparable
proportions of the viewing time (approximately 40% to 50% each). Similar trends were
observed with mean dominance durations (Figure 5(b)), and our observations corroborated
with the statistical results. Compared with the low-pass and fixed sequences, the standard
sequence had a significantly longer predominance, V ¼ 28, p ¼ .02 for both, and a
significantly larger mean dominance duration, V ¼ 28, p ¼ .02 and V ¼ 28, p ¼ .03,
respectively. No significant differences were observed between low-pass and fixed sequences
for predominance, V ¼ 8, p ¼ .34, and mean dominance duration, V ¼ 15, p ¼ .94.
Supplementary analyses showed that the standard sequence had a comparable advantage
over fixed and low-pass sequences. That is, the difference in predominance between the
standard and fixed sequences was statistically comparable between that of the standard and
low-pass sequences, V ¼ 19, p ¼ .47, and the same trend was observed in mean dominance
durations, V ¼ 11, p ¼ .69.
Figure 6 summarises the alternation frequencies of each match, the predominance and
mean dominance of horizontally and vertically oriented patterns. As shown in Figure 6(a),

results were summarised as bar graphs, which represent the distributions of data points, the median and the

predominance than the fixed and low-pass sequences, demonstrating an effect of spatial entropy when the
sequences were matched in contrast. As predicted, the low-pass and fixed sequences dominated a
comparable proportion of the total viewing time, indicating a null effect of temporal entropy. (b) Mean
dominance duration results. Similar to predominance, the standard sequence had higher mean dominance
durations than the low-pass and fixed sequences, and there was no significant difference between the fixed
and sine sequences.
Han et al. 15
the match between fixed and low-pass sequences had approximately 20% lower number of
alternations than the other two matches. Collapsed across all three matches, we found that
predominance and mean dominance were comparable between vertically and horizontally
oriented patterns. Statistical analyses showed that the differences in alternation frequencies
were not significant, 2(2) ¼ 4.6, p ¼ .10. The predominance and mean dominance duration of
vertically and horizontally patterns were also not significantly different, V ¼ 5, p ¼ .16 and
V ¼ 10, p ¼ .58, respectively.
Discussion for Experiment 5
Experiments 3 and 4 revealed a modest influence of spatial entropy that was only observed
with stepped presentation schedules. As stepped presentation schedules have a broadband
temporal frequency spectrum, we asked if the effect of spatial entropy was dependent on the
presence of higher temporal frequency content. In addition, because Experiments 3 and 4 had
used a large contrast imbalance between the eyes, we questioned if the effect of entropy was
limited by the existing strong suppression of the target. To investigate these questions, we
eliminated the contrast imbalance between the eyes in Experiment 5 and pitted standard,
fixed and low-pass Mondrian sequences against each other in a rivalry paradigm (or boxing
match). Despite the removal of the interocular contrast imbalance, we obtained similar
results to Experiments 3 and 4. Specifically, the standard sequence produced significantly
higher predominance and mean dominance durations than the fixed sequence.
This advantage, however, was not observed when low-pass and standard sequences
rivalled against each other. The low-pass sequence was less dominant than the standard
sequence, but it performed comparably to the fixed sequence. Since spatial entropy was
preserved in the low-pass sequence, the advantage obtained with spatial entropy was
dependent on the presence of the low energy, high temporal frequency content in the
standard masker. We also found no significant differences when we compared
Figure 6. Results for alternation frequency and orientation in Experiment 5. (a) Alternation frequency for
each boxing match. The number of perceptual switches was comparable across all three matches,
demonstrating that spatial entropy in the standard sequence did not trigger more perceptual switches but
prolonged mean dominance and predominance (cf. Figure 5). (b) Predominance of vertically and horizontally
oriented pattern sequences. Horizontally oriented patterns were slightly more dominant than vertically
oriented sequences; however, the effect was subtle and not statistically significant. (c) Mean dominance
duration of vertically and horizontally oriented sequences. Similar to predominance, both orientations had
statistically comparable mean dominance durations. The bar graphs illustrated the distributions of data points,

the alternation rates of the different matches. On some other tasks not involving interocular
competition, sensitivity differences between horizontal and vertical orientations have been
found (e.g., length judgments: Gottsdanker & Tietz, 1992), but we saw no evidence that those
orthogonal orientations differed in predominance during binocular rivalry. Thus, the main
effect of spatial entropy was to prolong each period of suppression throughout the course of
the viewing time. In addition, this effect was dependent on the higher temporal frequency
content and not likely to be a consequence of pattern orientation.
Compared with temporally high-pass filtered Mondrian maskers, Han et al. (2018) found
that CFS suppression was stronger when temporally low-pass filtered Mondrian maskers
contained coherent pattern edges. While these findings argued for a pairing of low temporal
frequencies and pattern edges in CFS, note that the study examined suppressive effectiveness
using isolated high and low temporal frequency content. By keeping the temporal frequency
content of our Mondrian sequences predominantly biased towards low frequencies, our results
showed that the low energy, higher temporal frequencies in the Mondrian masker could
enhance interocular suppression but only if they were paired with spatial entropy. Without
spatial entropy, higher temporal frequencies in the fixed sequence did not provide any
advantage over the low-pass sequence presumably because of increased adaptation (see Alais
et al., 2010) and inhibitory action from the higher frequencies to the lower frequencies (Cass &
Alais, 2006). As spatial entropy only provided an advantage when transients were present (cf.
Figure 5(b)), our results hinted at the presence of pattern structure masking processes (see Enns
& Di Lollo, 2000; Macknik et al., 2000) which might act in tandem with lower level rivalry
processes suggested elsewhere (e.g., Han et al., 2016; Yang & Blake, 2012).
Conclusion
One of the important concepts in the early years of cognitive science was the notion of
information entropy. Originating in data communication theory (Shannon, 1948), entropy
expresses the simple idea that the predictability of an event is inversely related to its
information content. Expressed even more colloquially, surprising outcomes convey more
information than expected ones (Friston, 2018). We have applied this notion to the analysis
of monocularly viewed sequences of rapidly presented arrays of image features forming
animations used to induce a potent form of interocular suppression dubbed CFS
(Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005). In particular, we have varied the informational uncertainty, that
is, the entropy, of CFS sequences in both the space and time domains, in an effort to identify
the conditions favouring maximal suppression strength.
Our results show that temporal entropy has little influence on CFS effectiveness. This is
perhaps not surprising, as previous work has implicated low temporal rates as optimal for
CFS effectiveness (Han et al., 2016, 2018), and slow oscillations are predictable and thus low
in entropy. Increasing the Mondrian refresh rate, however, has been shown to broaden the
temporal tuning function of CFS (Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005; Zhu et al., 2016). Had temporal
entropy been a dominant part of CFS effectiveness, we would expect suppression strength to
rise with refresh rate because higher refresh rates broaden the temporal frequency spectrum
and increase its resemblance to white noise. Spatially, we observed measurable, but modest
effects of predictability. The presence of unpredictable pattern changes, that is, higher
entropy, prolonged masker predominance significantly, but only if the maskers compared
had stepped presentation schedules and were also presented with a temporally compatible
target (Figure 4(a)). Pitting the different Mondrian sequences in a rivalry paradigm showed
that the effect of spatial entropy was dependent on the presence of the low energy, higher
temporal frequency content in the Mondrian.
Han et al. 17
These results demonstrate some interesting points. First, studies have reported effects of feature
selectivity in interocular suppression (Han & Alais, 2018; Moors et al., 2014; Stuit, Cass, Paffen, &
Alais, 2009). Although we did not test low-level properties explicitly, we did obtain evidence of
temporal frequency selectivity. For example, spatial entropy only had a significant effect on CFS
dynamics when the target and masker were temporally compatible (Figure 4(a)). Similarly,
manipulating the regularity of pattern updates did not result in significant differences in CFS
dynamics, presumably because of the comparable temporal frequency content between the regular
and irregular pattern update schedules (Figures 2 and 3(a)). Second, temporal frequency selectivity
was not the only low-level influence in our data, as fixed and sine sequences performed
comparably regardless of the target rate (Figure 4). Apart from the similarities between the 1/f
temporal spectrum and slow sine modulation (both have low frequency power in common), other
factors include the stepped presentation and high temporal frequency content of the fixed
sequence. These factors could promote neural adaptation (see Alais et al., 2010) and cross-
channel inhibition on lower frequencies (Cass & Alais, 2006), weakening any potential
advantage of the broader frequency spectrum of the fixed masker.
This brings us to the third point. If the low-level factors associated with the stepped
presentation of the fixed masker were detrimental to its effectiveness, how were these
limitations overcome by spatial entropy in the standard masker? We surmise that the
unpredictable, dynamic edges in the Mondrian pattern comprise the key feature of the
spatial entropy effect, as spatially uncorrelated and unpredictable noise patterns have been
shown to be weaker than intact Mondrian patterns (Drewes, Zhu, & Melcher, 2018; Han
et al., 2018). Since the effect of spatial entropy was dependent on the presence of higher
temporal frequencies in Experiment 5, we postulate that the transient, unpredictable phase
congruencies in the Mondrian may provide some form of pattern masking (see Enns & Di
Lollo, 2000; Macknik et al., 2000). As has been suggested by previous reports (Han et al.,
2018; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005; Yang & Blake, 2012), the masking processes could further
enhance ongoing rivalry suppression processes in CFS. Based on our current results and a
previous report by Han et al. (2018), the extent of masking influence appears to be small,
though it may become useful for impairing target visibility at later phases of CFS
suppression. Our results in Experiment 3 (Figure 4(a)) also suggest that masking could aid
in maintaining the effectiveness of CFS suppression over prolonged periods.
In closing, we should stress that our analysis is based on measures of CFS effectiveness
collected over extended viewing periods of 60s (Experiments 1­4) or 90s (Experiment 5).
In our task, participants tracked the changes in visibility and suppression of the target,
similar to the common dominance tracking task used in binocular rivalry to quantify
alternation dynamics (e.g., Brascamp et al., 2006), but seldom used in CFS. It is possible
that different perspectives on CFS strength might arise if suppression potency were measured
using another approach, such as measuring the initial suppression duration before the target
breaks through to visibility (the so-called b-CFS method; e.g., Jiang et al., 2007). Another
useful approach would be to measure the transient reduction in visual sensitivity of the
suppressed eye using the contrast probe technique, as often used in binocular rivalry to
measure the strength of suppression (Nguyen, Freeman, & Alais, 2003) and occasionally
used in CFS studies (Tsuchiya, Koch, Gilroy, & Blake, 2006), although recent work
suggests these measures are highly correlated (Han & Alais, 2018, see Figures 2 and 3).
