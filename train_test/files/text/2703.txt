ABSTRACT
Background: More recent data are required for effective measures to prevent marijuana use
among youth in the United States. Objective: To investigate the risk of marijuana use onset by
age using the most recent data from a national sample. Methods: Data for participants (n = 26,659)
aged 12­21 years from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (50.4% male,
55.6% White) were analyzed. Patterns of the risk of marijuana use initiation from birth to age of 20
years by single year of age were characterized using hazards survival models. Results: The
estimated hazards of marijuana use showed unique age patterns for the overall sample and by
gender and racial/ethnic groups. Up to age of 11 years, the hazards of marijuana use initiation
were below 0.0500; the hazards after age of 11 years increased rapidly with two peaks at age 16
(0.1291) and 18 years (0.1496), separated by a reduction at age 17 years (0.1112). The age pattern
differed significantly by gender (hazards from high to low: male, female) and race/ethnicity
(hazards from high to low: multi-racial, Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian). By age of 21 years,
54.1% (56.4% for male and 51.9% for female) had initiated marijuana use with a mean onset age
of 16.5 years. Conclusions: This study documented the risk of marijuana use initiation by age.
Research findings suggest the timing of marijuana use prevention was no later than middle
school. Additional attention is indicated to multi-racial/ethnic youth. Future interventions should
be developed for both parents and adolescents, and delivered to the right target population at
the right time.

Introduction
Background
Marijuana use represents a significant public health
challenge in developed countries across the globe,
including the United States. Marijuana is the single
most commonly used illicit drug among US youth;
the prevalence of marijuana use continues to increase
despite the increases in the perceived harm of mari-
juana (1­3). Documented studies indicate that mari-
juana use can start at a very young age (4,5). The
health burden of adolescent marijuana use is substantial
because of a number of negative consequences of early
marijuana exposure, including developmental, neuro-
cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral problems
(4,6­9).
Developmentally, early marijuana exposure has been
found to be associated with greater impairment in brain
growth, severe cognitive consequences, and poorer
long-term health outcomes (4,8,10). Neurocognitively,
early onset of marijuana use is reported to be associated
with deficits in cognitive and executive functioning,
including processing speed, sustained attention, work-
ing memory, judgment and planning, problem-solving,
decision-making, and self-regulation (6,7,11­13).
Sociobehaviorally, early onset of illicit marijuana use
has repeatedly been shown to be a risk factor for
tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, other illicit
drug use, sexual risk behaviors, violence, and risky
driving (14­21).
Although adolescence and young adulthood represent
the most vulnerable periods in the life course for sub-
stance use initiation (9,22­24), the likelihood of initia-
tion may vary with age, reflecting the imbalance between
physiological growth and neurocognitive development
(25). Evidence-based drug use prevention strategies
must target the most vulnerable age range to maximize
the intervention effect among young people against mar-
ijuana. The risk of initiating the use of several substances
by age has been documented, including cigarette smok-
ing (22,23,26) and alcohol consumption (22,27).
However, little has been done to investigate the risk of

marijuana use onset by age. To our knowledge, only one
study existed that ever examined the risk of marijuana
use initiation as a function of age. However, that study
was based on data from a female sample in the Midwest,
and did not report hazards of initiation by age (22).
More recent data are required for more effective mea-
sures to prevent marijuana use among youth in the
United States.
In addition to an overall pattern, the likelihood of
marijuana use onset by age may differ by race/ethnicity.
Racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of marijuana
and other substance use have long been recognized
(23,28­30). Part of the explanation for the differences
has been attributed to differences in cultural backgrounds
and the process of acculturation (31­34). Individuals'
cultural background exerts great influence on their beha-
viors (34). For example, the low hazards of substance use
among Asian American adolescents than other groups is
attributed in a large part to the cultural values against such
behaviors at the familial and community level (23). On
the contrary, stress associated with acculturation may
increase the risk for ethnic minority youth in the United
States to use drugs as coping strategies to deal with cul-
tural conflicts and interpersonal tensions (35). The era of
globalization leads to the emergence of another racial/
ethnic group: multi-race due to the growing number of
interracial marriages (36,37). Relative to others, youth
with multi-racial backgrounds could be at a greater risk
to initiate marijuana use because of potential higher
family economic status, increased exposure to cultural
conflicts, and more opportunities to access to marijuana
through dual- or multi-cultural venues (29,30,37).
Purpose of this study
The purpose of this study is to investigate the like-
lihood of marijuana use initiation across the age span
from birth to adolescence, and further to emerging
adulthood. Adolescence-emerging adulthood represents
a critical time in life that is highly susceptible to illicit
drug use. The ultimate goal is to provide more recent
data advancing our understanding on the period when
young people are most susceptible to marijuana use,
and develop potential interventions to prevent mari-
juana use among young people in the United States.
Materials and methods
Data source and study sample
Data used for this study were derived from the 2013
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
that are publically available for use. NSDUH is an annual
nationwide cross-sectional survey, sponsored by the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA). The purpose of this survey
is to monitor the prevalence and correlates of drug use
among the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged
12 years and older in the United States. The participants
were randomly selected using multi-stage clustered sam-
pling method. Sensitive questions, including marijuana
use were administered using Audio Computer-Assisted
Self Interviewing (ACASI) and Computer-Assisted Self
Interviewing (CASI), while other questions were adminis-
tered through Computed-Assisted Personal Interviewing
(CAPI). The screening response rate was 83.93% and the
interview response rate was 71.69% in 2013 (38).
We elected to use the 2013 NSDUH data for this
analysis because they are the most recent data available
in the designated website by SAMHSA (https://nsduh
web.rti.org/ respweb/homepage.cfm). To quantify the
hazards of marijuana use onset by age, only participants
in the age range of 12­21 years were included.
Participants older than 21 years in the public domain
data are presented by age group rather than single year
of age. These participants (n = 28,495) were excluded.
In addition, participants who reported first marijuana
use younger than 5 years of age (n = 6) were excluded,
yielding a final sample of 26,659 participants.
Research conduct
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at University of Florida
Variables and their measurements
Age of onset of marijuana use
The key variable for this study was measured with data
from self-reported age when a participant used mari-
juana the first time in his/her life. In NSDUH, partici-
pants were asked: "How old were you the first time you
used marijuana or hashish?" The reported age in years
was used for analysis. For 138 participants with missing
data on age of onset, imputed results were used.
Retrospectively reported onset age has been used in
survival analysis to estimate age patterns of the risk of
onset, including onset of tobacco use (23) and alcohol
consumption (18,22). In such analyses, the valid esti-
mate of the mean age of first use of a substance can be
obtained assuming the reported errors in the age of
onset to be normally distributed with a zero mean.
Other variables for marijuana use
Participants were coded as "lifetime marijuana users" if
they answered "yes" to the question: "Have you ever,
2 X. CHEN ET AL.
even once, used marijuana or hashish?" They were
further coded as "current marijuana users" if they
reported having used marijuana within the past 30
days in response to the question: "How long has it
been since you last used marijuana or hashish?"
Demographic variables
This group of variables were age (in years), gender
(male/female), and race/ethnicity of White, Black,
Hispanic, Asian, multi-race, and others (American
Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other
Pacific Islanders). These variables were used to describe
and compare the sample characteristics.
Statistical analysis
Survival analysis was used to quantify the hazards of
initiation of marijuana use by age. Different from the
age-specific rate of lifetime use, the hazards of initiation
is referred to as the instantaneous probability at which a
group of individuals at the beginning of an age may
initiate marijuana use during a 1-year period. With this
definition, the single-year age data up to age 21 years
allowed us to quantify the hazards of marijuana use
onset from birth to age 20 years. Survival analysis is a
powerful method to estimate the hazards of onset by
age with a set of functions to characterize the time to
event (39).
We constructed survival models to analyze the data
by treating the reported age of first marijuana use as
time t, measured from birth to initiation of marijuana
use, and the initiation of marijuana use as the event (or
failure in survival analysis). Participants who had not
yet initiated marijuana use at the time of the survey
were treated as censored. Although it would not be
possible to know when and whether these participants
might start using marijuana, the survival modeling
analysis procedures automatically account for the
hazards of these participants. With this modeling
approach, the age pattern of the hazards of marijuana
use initiation was quantified based on a re-constructed
longitudinal cohort.
The SAS PROC LIFETEST for survival analysis
was used to analyze the hazards of onset H(t) at
age or time t, and was estimated with the Kaplan­
Meier product­moment method. The proportion of
individuals who never used marijuana at age or time
t, corresponding to the survival function S(t) was
thus estimated using H(t). Subsequently, 1 ­ S(t)
provides an estimate of survival-model-based preva-
lence of lifetime marijuana use by age from birth to
age 21 years. With the modeled result of 1 ­ S(t), the
mean age (95% confidence interval (CI)) of
marijuana initiation was estimated as the total area
under the curve 1 ­ S(t). This survival-model-based
mean age is more reliable than the directly computed
mean age from self-reported data using the "svy"
statement in Stata, which was used to compute
point estimate and 95% CI, considering the multi-
level cluster random sampling strategy NSDUH used
to recruit participants (23,40).
To test if data were appropriate for survival analysis,
plots of ­log [S(t)] against time (age) and ­log[S(t)]
against log[­log[S(t)]] were used for individual survival
models. An approximately linear distribution of the
plot of ­log[S(t)] against log[­log[S(t)]] was used as
the criterion to assess data­model fit (41). Lastly, the
log-rank test was used to assess differences in the
hazards of marijuana use initiation between male and
female gender and across racial/ethnic groups (41).
This approach has been frequently used in reported
studies to investigate the hazards of onset by age for
other substances (23,26,27).
Statistical analyses were conducted using the com-
mercial software SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC) and Stata, version 14.0 (Stata Corp., College
Station, TX).
Results
Demographic factors and marijuana use
The study sample contained 26,659 participants aged
12­21 years, of whom 50.4% were male, 55.6% were
White, and the mean age of the sample was 16.20 years
(SD = 2.79). Among the study sample, 28.6% reported
lifetime marijuana use and 12.2% reported current use
(see Table 1 for more details).
Hazards of initiation of marijuana use
The plots of ­log[S(t)] against log[­log[S(t)]]
showed a distribution close to a straight line for
the overall sample and for the individual subgroups
by gender and ethnic groups, indicating a good
data­model fit. Figure 1 depicts the estimated
hazards of initiation of marijuana use by single
year of age from birth to age of 20 years. Up to
age of 11 years (corresponding to grade 6), the
estimated hazards of marijuana use initiation were
at a very low level and increased gradually with age.
After age of 11 years, the hazards increased rapidly
to 12.9% at age of 16 years (corresponding to grade
10), forming the first peak. After a transient decline
to 11.1% at age 17 years (corresponding to grade
11), the hazards jumped to 15.0% forming the
THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE 3
second peak at 18 years (higher than the first one)
before it declined. The age patterns of the hazards of
marijuana use initiation were similar by gender;
however, the hazard level for males was significantly
higher than that for females up to age of 18 years.
Log-rank test indicated that the gender difference
was statistically significant (2 = 58.99, p < 0.0001).
Estimated prevalence rate of lifetime marijuana-
use by age
Based on the estimated hazards of marijuana use initia-
tion by age, the estimated prevalence rates of lifetime
marijuana use by age are presented in Figure 2.
Consistent with the estimated hazard of onset pre-
sented in Figure 1, the estimated lifetime prevalence
rates of marijuana use showed an almost linear increase
from age of 13 to 18 years before it started to slow
down. By age of 17 years (12th grade), 31.3% adoles-
cents (33.6% for males and 29.0% for females) had ever
used marijuana; the prevalence reached 54.1% (56.4%
for male and 51.9% for female) by age of 21 years.
Racial/ethnic differences in the hazards of
marijuana use initiation
Results in Figure 3 indicate significant differences in
the estimated hazards of marijuana use initiation
across ethnic groups (2 = 190.48, p < 0.0001).
Overall, the hazards curve of marijuana use initiation
by age was the lowest with the least variation for
Asian Americans and the highest with the largest
variations for multi-race Americans. The two-peak
pattern observed for the total US sample was also
seen across all ethnic groups except Asian. Relative to
Asian Americans, the log-rank test indicated that the

Estimated mean age of marijuana onset
Results in Table 2 indicate that from birth to age of 17
years, the estimated mean age (95% CI) of onset of
marijuana use was 14.88 (14.87, 14.89) years based on
survival models, significantly higher than 13.90 (13.80,
14.00) years, the onset age directly calculated from the
reported data (no 95% CI overlap). Additional results
for the survival-model-based estimates and directly
computed mean ages of onset are presented in Table 2.
Discussion
In this study, we documented the age pattern of mar-
ijuana use initiation among US youth up to age of 21
years. Up to age of 11 years, the risk of marijuana use
initiation is very low for both males and females. After
age of 11 years, the risk increases rapidly with the first
peak at age 16 years (corresponding to grade 10). After
a transient decline at age of 17 years (corresponding to
grade 11), the risk reached another peak at 18 years
higher than that at age of 16 years. The age patterns of
the risk of marijuana use initiation are similar by gen-
der; but the level is higher for males than females,
overall and by most of the racial/ethnic groups.
Findings of this study indicate that the age pattern of
marijuana use onset differs from that of tobacco and
alcohol use initiation. Reported data from published
studies on cigarette smoking and alcohol use indicate
that the likelihood of onset often peaks around age
14­15 years (22,23). This is the period during which
the imbalance between physical and cognitive develop-
ment reaches the highest level (42,43). However, our
study findings indicate a much delayed peak for mar-
ijuana use onset: 16­18 years of age with the highest
peak at age of 18 years when a child becomes an adult.
This peak risk cannot be well explained by the imbal-
anced development of physiology and cognition.
The current age pattern of marijuana use onset has
significant implications for drug use prevention. Early
initiation of drug use in adolescence is positively asso-
ciated with drug use and abuse in subsequent years, and
early prevention has added effect to marijuana use
control (23,44, 45). In this study, the risk of marijuana
use onset was observed to increase rapidly at age of 11
years, while most existing marijuana intervention pro-
grams (46­50) target students aged 15 years and above
in grades 9­12 or college who already had advanced to
the high-risk period for several years. Based on our
findings, effective drug use prevention should start no
later than age of 10 years before the risk of marijuana
use onset starts to increase. Further, findings from our
study also showed a dip in the risk of marijuana use
onset at 17 years when many students in high school
are preparing for college entrance. This finding implies
that among many factors, emphasizing academic work
and achievement may present a strategy to reduce the
risk of marijuana use onset in later adolescence.
Additional research is suggested to study the peak risk
of marijuana use onset at age 18 years after high school.
Likely explanations for this increased risk may include
but are not limited to reductions in parental monitor-
ing, increases in peer influence, and feeling rebellious
when youth leave home the first time for college (5).
One surprising finding of this study is that the
hazards of marijuana use initiation was the highest for
US youth with multi-racial backgrounds across the age/
time span up to age of 21 years. As the United States
becomes more racially diverse, differences in multi-
racial and multi-cultural experience and the process of
acculturation may play a key role in the drug initiation.
The finding that multi-race individuals experience the
highest hazards of marijuana use initiation than others
needs further research. It is likely that these children
may experience more intercultural conflicts at home,
exclusion in schools, and the wider communities
(36,37). They may also struggle in their identification
with a single racial identity or face pressures to not
dissociate with one or more of their ethnicities when

identifying with only one (37,51). Furthermore, the
multi-cultural background may present increased
opportunity for these youth than others to access
marijuana.
Consistent with findings from studies on many sub-
stance use behaviors (23,32), the hazards of marijuana
use onset is the lowest among Asian Americans. This
phenomenon may be associated with the traditional
cultural norms and values in the Asian countries,
where the drug use among adolescents are unaccepta-
ble; and these value norms and values are still observed
in families and communities in the United States (23).
The hazards for Black and Hispanic are similar to those
for White and higher than for Asian. Racial and ethnic
differences in marijuana use onset represent a very
complex question. Findings of this study provide
some preliminary data informing future behavioral
research to investigate factors that may contribute to
the racial ethnic difference and to devise intervention
programs for high-risk groups.
In addition, the hazards of marijuana use initiation
differed by gender. Relative to adolescent females,
males are more likely to initiate marijuana use during
the transition from adolescence to young adulthood.
This finding is consistent with data reported by others
in previous studies (52,53). Furthermore, when the
gender differences were assessed by racial/ethnic
groups, males are at higher risk to initiate marijuana
use than females if they are White, Black, or Hispanic.
These gender and racial/ethnic differences in the risk of
marijuana use initiation should also be considered in
drug use prevention programming.
Mean age of drug use initiation, including mar-
ijuana use initiation is a commonly used indicator
in drug use research and prevention. Traditionally,
this statistic is computed based on the subsample of
participants who initiated drug use. The mean age
calculated using this method tends to be underesti-
mated because it does not consider the contribution
of those in the sample who are likely to but have
not yet started drug use. The survival analysis pro-
vides a method to overcome this limitation. In this
study, we have shown that the traditionally com-
puted mean age of marijuana use initiation is
13.90 by age of 17 years, about 1 year less than
age 14.88, estimated by the survival-model-based
method A greater difference was observed for the
estimated mean age by age 21 years (15.20 vs.
16.46). This model-based mean age can be used in
research to define early and later initiation as seen
in reported studies (4,7).
There are strengths and limitations to this work.
This study was conducted using the NSDUH data that
represents the total US population. We used a retro-
spectively reported age of onset to build a birth cohort
to estimate hazards of marijuana use onset starting at
birth. This approach also enabled us to complete the
analysis avoiding bias due to attrition (drug users are
more likely to lost to follow-up than non-users) as
inherited in longitudinal data (23). However, the lack
of data by single year of age for participants older than
21 years prevented this study from analyzing the
hazards of marijuana use onset for age ranges older
than 21 years. In addition, we cannot examine the
hazards of marijuana use onset for a more detailed
racial/ethnic group analysis because no adequate data
are available from the NSDUH public dataset. The
findings of this study could only be applied to mari-
juana use, and other substances should be included in
future studies. In addition to studying marijuana use
onset alone, future research should pay attention to the
initiation of use of more than one substance and drug
as a comorbidity to better understand the behavior and
to more effectively inform drug use prevention.
Conclusions
Scientific data on the exact time when a person starts to
use marijuana is a prerequisite for evidence-based
intervention and public health policy planning and
decision-making. This study is the first to examine the
likelihood of initiation of marijuana use by age from
birth to 21 years with data from a representative
national sample of the US population. Findings of this
study add to the literature regarding the overall age
pattern of the risk of marijuana use initiation for the
total sample and for both male and female genders and
the major racial/ethnic groups. Such data are urgently
needed for marijuana use prevention programming
among the approximately 43 million US youth aged
12­21 years (54) who are at highest risk of initiating
marijuana use. Drug use prevention programs should
consider the age, gender, and racial/ethnic differences
in risk of marijuana use initiation among adolescents
and emerging adults. Intervention programs should be
developed for both parents and adolescents, and deliv-
ered to the right target population at the right time for
better prevention effect. Attention has also to be paid to
youth with multi-racial/ethnic backgrounds because of
the risk of marijuana use onset among them is higher
than all others.
