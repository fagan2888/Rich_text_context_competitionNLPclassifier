Progressive static pulmonary hyperinflation in survivors of severe
bronchopulmonary dysplasia by mid-adulthood
ABSTRACT
Background: Severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) might be associated with an accelerated
age­related decline of lung function.
Methods: 14 individuals were studied longitudinally at 1564, 1863 and 3863.2 years.
Information on personal history was completed, and lung function testing and skin prick testing
were performed. Longitudinal data were compared intra-individually and with matched controls
from the NHANES III dataset.
Results: The ratio of residual volume/total lung capacity (RV/TLC) increased markedly from
25.967.0% to 39.366.8%. A significant time-effect was found compared to controls for the
forced vital capacity (FVC) which decreased more rapidly than expected. Flow values were at the
lower limit of normal range but remained relatively stable over time. Some individuals had
completely normal lung function results.
Conclusion: Increasing static pulmonary hyperinflation with age is indicative of bronchiolar
dysfunction or early emphysematous changes in survivors of severe BPD. Susceptibility for
long-term sequelae shows significant variability.
In 1967, Northway et al1 reported on
harmful effects of barotrauma and oxygen
toxicity in prematurely born children,
causing an acquired lung disease called
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that was
characterised by patchy bronchoalveolar
scarring, atelectases and overexpansion.
With the introduction of lung protective
ventilation and the advent of surfactant,
the features of BPD have changed.2 Residual
lung function abnormalities, mainly airflow
obstruction and hyperinflation,3 were found
in young adults, and emphysematous
changes found by CT raised the question
whether BPD might ultimately affect
pulmonary ageing, for example, by leading to
the development of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.4 5
A unique cohort of 20 survivors of severe
BPD born before the advent of lung protec-
tive ventilation and surfactant has been
observed longitudinally into adulthood.
Neonatal pulmonary management had
included pressure-controlled mechanical
ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures
up to 40 cm H2
O adjusted to repeated blood
gas analyses; FiO2
values of 0.3, 0.4, 0.75 or
1.0 and 1 to 2 hourly suctioning and at least
48-hourly changing of the endotracheal
tubes. The individuals had undergone
pulmonary function testing at 1564 years
(1983) and 1863 years (1987). Sixteen of
them could be contacted for follow-up at
3863.2 years, and 14 (5 women) consented
to participate. Subjects underwent skin
prick testing to prevalent aeroallergens and
pulmonary function testing. Each individual
was matched for age, sex and height with
one to four individuals from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
III dataset, both for the 1987 and the 2008
follow-up (courtesy of Dr J.L. Hankinson,
Valdosta, GA, USA). Further details are
outlined in the online supplement.
The perinatal characteristics were birth-
weight 17956456 g (mean6SD), gestational
age 31.862.9 weeks, highest documented
peak inspiratory pressures 2664.5 cmH2
O,
endotracheal intubation for 38 (range
4e103) days and FiO2
$0.4 for 36 (range
4e96) days. Five individuals had been
tracheotomised for an extended period. The
first sequential lung function study in 1983
and 1987 had revealed mean flow parameters
around the lower limit of normal, but no
significant changes over time.
Six individuals reported a variety of
persisting respiratory symptoms, mainly
asthma, cough or shortness of breath during
exercise. Four individuals with hay fever
were sensitised to pollens; an additional
person was sensitised to cat allergens
without symptoms. Two individuals were
on occasional inhaled corticosteroids. There
were four current smokers (8e16 pack-years)
and one former smoker. Six individuals had
shown bronchial hyperreactivity to meth-
acholine in 1987, two of whom still reacted

showed moderate reactivity in 2008. Transfer
factor of the lung for carbon monoxide in
2008 was 83.5615.7% (mean6SD, range
58e107%) of predicted; FeNO was 10.868.5
(range 4e27 ppb). The results of pulmonary
function testing are depicted in table 1 and
figure 1. Smoking and other potential
confounders had no significant effect; lowest
flow values were found among non-smokers.
The results are consistent with a progres-
sive static hyperinflation into mid-adulthood,
suggestive of progressive bronchiolar dysfunc-
tion or early emphysematous changes with
ageing in severe BPD. The relatively minor
flow changes during the 20-year period indi-
cate dysfunction of small airways and are
dissimilar to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, hinting to differing disease mecha-
nisms. The current study is in line with the
concept of adult lung disease originating early
in life. Susceptibility for long-term sequelae
shows significant variability.
