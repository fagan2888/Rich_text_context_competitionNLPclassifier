Abstract
Background: Specialty-specific data on career satisfaction may be useful for understanding
physician workforce trends and for counseling medical students about career options.
Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 6,590 physicians (response rate, 53%) in Round
4 (2004-2005) of the Community Tracking Study Physician Survey. The dependent variable ranged
from +1 to -1 and measured satisfaction and dissatisfaction with career. Forty-two specialties were
analyzed with survey-adjusted linear regressions
Results: After adjusting for physician, practice, and community characteristics, the following
specialties had significantly higher satisfaction levels than family medicine: pediatric emergency
medicine (regression coefficient = 0.349); geriatric medicine (0.323); other pediatric subspecialties
(0.270); neonatal/prenatal medicine (0.266); internal medicine and pediatrics (combined practice)
(0.250); pediatrics (0.250); dermatology (0.249);and child and adolescent psychiatry (0.203). The
following specialties had significantly lower satisfaction levels than family medicine: neurological
surgery (-0.707); pulmonary critical care medicine (-0.273); nephrology (-0.206); and obstetrics and
gynecology (-0.188). We also found satisfaction was significantly and positively related to income
and employment in a medical school but negatively associated with more than 50 work-hours per-
week, being a full-owner of the practice, greater reliance on managed care revenue, and
uncontrollable lifestyle. We observed no statistically significant gender differences and no
differences between African-Americans and whites.
Conclusion: Career satisfaction varied across specialties. A number of stakeholders will likely be
interested in these findings including physicians in specialties that rank high and low and students
contemplating specialty. Our findings regarding "less satisfied" specialties should elicit concern from
residency directors and policy makers since they appear to be in critical areas of medicine.
Background
The medical literature is replete with generalizations
about morale within individual medical specialties.
Internists are "unhappy" and "turning some students
away from general internal medicine[1]." "Cardiology is
perceived as very demanding in terms of work hours[2]."
Surgeons are more negatively impacted by "physical
exhaustion" and conflicts between professional and per-

sonal life[3]. Obstetricians and gynecologists may be "at
risk of burnout[4]." Geriatricians "have the highest job
satisfaction of any subspecialty[5]." Stress among psychi-
atrists dissuades "medical students from choosing psychi-
atry[6]." Yet these broad assessments are seldom made in
comparison to other specialties. Apart from our earlier
study, we are aware of no other to compare specialties
with a nationally representative sample[7]. But this previ-
ous study uses data from 1996-1997 and satisfaction
within specialties may have changed[8]. According to a
widely cited study, physicians today want more control of
lifestyle[8].
Satisfaction is important. Physician satisfaction has been
found to strongly correlate with patient satisfaction[9]
and desirable patient outcomes[10]. A balance in the spe-
cialty mix of physicians is necessary to maintain a high
quality of medical care for all Americans[11]. Current dis-
satisfaction may lead to future declines in numbers of
physicians within specialties. Dissatisfied physicians may
be more likely to unionize[12], to strike[13], to experi-
ence medical problems themselves[14] and to exit medi-
cine altogether[15]. Finally, dissatisfaction may increase
rates of medical errors, thus jeopardizing patient
safety[16].
This study will update our earlier study with more recent
data. Comparative data may help medical school faculty
and residency directors to provide medical students with
appropriate career counseling, enable medical group
managers and policy makers to anticipate workforce
trends, and provide practicing physicians with interesting
information that could potentially influence career and
retirement decisions.
Methods
Data
Data were obtained from Round 4 (2004-2005) of the
Community Tracking Physician Study (CTS)[17,18]. The
survey is a representative sample of physicians, not
employed by the federal government, who resided in the
continental United States and who provided direct patient
care at least 20 hours per week. The survey followed a
complex design with a nationally representative sample of
60 communities selected with probability proportional to
size (based on estimated population size in July, 1992)
from strata defined by geographical region, community
size and whether the community is metropolitan or non-
metropolitan. These sites were selected in Round 1 of the
CTS and have been used in Rounds 1-4 for second-stage
sampling of physicians in the so-called site sample. For rea-
sons of economy, an independent national supplemental
sample was not drawn in Round 4, as was done in each of
the three previous rounds. At the second stage of sampling
in Round 4, an unequal probability sample of physicians
was drawn from within each of the 60 sites from strata
and sampling classes defined by cross-classifying physi-
cians in the American Medical Association and American
Osteopathic Association master files. This classification
was carried out according to primary care status and the
physician's status and disposition relative to the survey
frame and selected sample for the previous round (2000-
2001) of the CTS Physician Survey[17] As in previous sur-
vey rounds, some hospital-based specialists such as radi-
ologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists as well as all
residents and fellows were excluded, while primary care
physicians and responders to previous survey rounds were
over-sampled[17,18]. The overall response rate was 53%
in 2004-2005[18]. Response rates by physician specialty
were not available, but CTS administrators maintain that
the data are representative[17,18]. The CTS data are pub-
licly available from the Inter-University Consortium for
Political and Social Research at the University of Michi-
gan.
The CTS dataset included information on a total of 6,628
physicians in 2004-2005. For our analysis, we required
valid (non-missing) answers for the satisfaction question
and for all of the control variables used in the multiple
regression model, a restriction that slightly reduced our
analysis sample to 6,590 physicians.
Dependent Variables
The dependent variable was created from answers to this
question: "Thinking very generally about your satisfaction
with your overall career in medicine, would you say that
you are currently... very satisfied, somewhat satisfied,
somewhat dissatisfied, very dissatisfied, neither satisfied
or dissatisfied, don't know, refused." We coded our satis-
faction-dissatisfaction variable as follows: equal to one if
the physician stated "very satisfied"; equal to zero for
"somewhat satisfied" or "neither"; and equal to negative
one for either "somewhat dissatisfied" or "very dissatis-
fied." "Somewhat dissatisfied" was combined with "very
dissatisfied" to increase power since only 4% stated they
were "very dissatisfied." "Somewhat satisfied" was com-
bined with "neither" to increase power in the middle
value, 0, of our satisfaction score (1 to -1) variable. "Don't
know" and "refused" responses were excluded. Roughly
42.7% were "very satisfied" (coded = +1), 42.9% were
either "somewhat satisfied" or "neither" (0); and 14.4%
were "somewhat" or "very" dissatisfied (-1).
Specialty Variables
Physician specialty codes classified physicians according
to the specialty or subspecialty they reported spending the
most time weekly. To enhance the integrity of findings, we
combined specialty classifications with fewer than 20
respondents into related specialty classifications to
achieve a minimum of 20 respondents in each of the

resulting 42 specialty classifications in the present analy-
sis. We also created a three-level lifestyle controllability
factor, based upon the Dorsey et al[8] study by grouping
specialties. "Controllable" specialties included dermatol-
ogy, emergency medicine, neurology, ophthalmology,
otolaryngology, and child, adolescent, and adult psychia-
try. "Uncontrollable" specialties included family practice,
general practice, internal medicine, internal medicine and
pediatrics (combined), obstetrics and gynecology, ortho-
pedic surgery, pediatrics, general surgery, and urology.
"Neither controllable nor uncontrollable" included the
remaining 26 specialties in our sample. The CTS did not
have data on some specialties mentioned by Dorsey et al8
including anesthesiology, pathology, and diagnostic radi-
ology.
Control Variables
We selected control variables based on literature review
and the Eisenberg Model[19,20]. Variables were classified
as physician characteristics, community factors, and prac-
tice factors, similar to the previous paper[7].
Physician characteristics included age, gender, race,
whether board certified, and whether graduated from for-
eign medical school. Race was available in 2004-2005,
not 1996-1997. Community factors included residence in
a town or area with less than 200,000 population
(roughly 9%) and residence in nine regions of the country
(see Table 1). States were grouped within regions that
were defined in the previous study[7].
Practice factors included: income, practice ownership, cur-
rent employment in a medical school, weekly work hours,
and experience with managed care. The CTS annual
income variable was expressed in dollar units up to a top-
code of $400,000. In regression models, we included a
rescaled version that expressed incomes in $100,000 units
for ease of interpretation of regression results (such that
the regression coefficient so generated indicates the
change in the satisfaction scale for every $100,000
increase in income). We also included in regression mod-
els a dummy variable for incomes reported at the top-code
($400,000 or greater). The three-level CTS practice owner-
ship variable was parameterized with two dummy varia-
bles--full owner (sole proprietor) and part owner
(partner)--using non-owners as the reference category. We
created one variable reflecting whether the physician was
currently employed by an academic medical center or
school, as opposed to working in private practice or work-
ing for a private firm. Work hours were grouped into cat-
egories of hours-per-week (40; 41-50; 51-60; over 60).
The physician's experience with managed care was cap-
tured by the variable "percent of revenue from managed
care," which was measured in 20 percentage-point units.

Statistical Methods
Survey design effects arising from unequal probability
sampling, stratification and clustering were accounted by
using weighting and survey data analysis procedures in
Version 9.2 of the SAS System[21] of statistical software
programs. Descriptive statistics reported the relative fre-
quency and mean satisfaction scores for each level of the
categorical variables.
Mean satisfaction scores were compared in uni-variable
and multiple linear regressions. for survey data in SAS
PROC SURVEYREG. Survey-adjusted Wald F-tests were
used to assess the null hypothesis that mean satisfaction
levels were homogeneous across specialties as well as
across levels of other independent variables. Regression
coefficients for specialties and lifestyle controllability are
reported with and without adjustment for control varia-
bles. Family practice was chosen as the reference category
for specialties for two reasons. First, it contained the most
incumbents (n = 1341) of any specialty. Second, family
practice percentages for our satisfaction score (0.23) was
close to the mean for all specialties (0.28).
Results
Tables 1 and 2 present relative frequencies and mean sat-
isfaction scores for each of the control variables as well as
the "lifestyle controllability" variable. Age range 45-54
contained the plurality of physicians (34%) Roughly 74%
were white, non-Hispanic; 4% were African-American,
non-Hispanic; and 5% were Hispanic, all races. Females
were 28%. Roughly 91% of the sample was board certified
and 20% were graduates of foreign medical schools.
Roughly 30% were sole proprietors and 22% were busi-
ness partners. The most frequent work hours category was
41-50 hours (28%). The bottom panel for "lifestyle con-
trollability" indicates that mean satisfaction scores were
not equal across these three groups: the average satisfac-
tion score for the "controllable" and the "neither control-
lable nor uncontrollable" groups were roughly 0.33
whereas the "uncontrollable" group mean satisfaction
score was only 0.24.
Table 3 left-side, provides descriptive statistics for the 42
specialties. Specialties with the greatest numbers of
incumbents included family practice (1,341), internal
medicine (1,005), pediatrics (740), and emergency medi-
cine (408). Table 3, right-side, provides linear regression
results on the 42 specialties, and ranks them based upon
the population weighted satisfaction score variable. Each
specialty was compared to the satisfaction score for family
medicine. The top two statistically significant specialties
that were positively associated with satisfaction were pedi-
atric emergency medicine and geriatric medicine. The bot-
tom two statistically significant specialties that were
negatively associated with satisfaction were pulmonary
critical care medicine and neurological surgery.

A second linear regression was run on the specialties
together with the covariates listed in Tables 1 and 2. We
present the results from that regression in two tables.
Table 4 contains results on control variables and Table 5
on specialties.
Considering Table 4, we found a U-shape for age with
age<35 and age 65-74 with the highest satisfaction scores.
Mean satisfaction scores did not vary significantly with
gender. We found only one minor result for race. The cat-
egory for "no race data" was statistically significant and
negatively related to satisfaction. Physicians from the East
South Central region reported higher and statistically sig-
nificant levels of satisfaction than those living in the
Pacific region.. Working as a sole proprietor of the practice
was negative and statistically significant in its association
with satisfaction. A positive association was found for cur-
rent employment in a medical school. Higher percentages
of revenue from managed care were significantly associ-
ated with lower levels of satisfaction.
Income and work-hours were the only control variables to
generate p-values below 0.001. Income was positively
associated with satisfaction. Since we controlled for
hours-worked-per-week, this suggested a strong positive
association between hourly wage and satisfaction. The
two work hour categories for more than 50 hours per-
week were strongly negative in their associations with sat-
isfaction.

covariates using linear regression. In comparison to fam-
ily practice, the highest statistically significant specialties

less satisfied than the referent category, "neither controlla-
ble nor uncontrollable."
Table 7 summarizes the statistically significant results on
specialties for 2004-05 and compares them with our ear-
lier analysis of 1996-97 data. Since the 1996-97 study
ranked specialties separately by "satisfaction" and "dissat-
isfaction" we re-interpreted our 2004-2005 results as fol-
lows: if the regression coefficient was positive and
statistically significant, we labeled this specialty as in the
"very satisfied " groups and if the coefficient was negative
and significant, we labeled this specialty as "dissatisfied."
For "very satisfied", there was remarkable consistency
from 1996-97 to 2004-05 with geriatric medicine, derma-
tology, neonatal medicine, and pediatrics at the top of
both lists. But only obstetrics and gynecology appeared on
both lists for "dissatisfied."
Discussion
In this discussion, we first consider the results as well as
the literature on specialties and control variables. Second,
we consider the implications; third we consider limita-
tions; and fourth, conclusions.
Geriatricians ranked at the top of the statistically signifi-
cant specialties labeled "very satisfied" in both 2004-2005
and 1996-1997. Shah et al[22] also find high levels of job
satisfaction for geriatricians. In addition to the steady
(non-erratic) hours, encounters with inspirational sen-
iors, and enduring relationships this specialty is enjoying
increasing demand as baby boomers retire[23]. Geriatri-
cians were also high on the list that did not adjust for any
covariates (ranked second in Table 3). But caution should
be exercised in interpreting these findings. Evidence indi-
cates that relatively poor Medicare reimbursements have
lead to shortages of geriatricians nationwide[24].
Pediatrics and pediatric sub-specialties rated high on sat-
isfaction both the 2004-05 and 1996-1997 samples. There
may be several reasons: 1) children tend to be more joyful
than adults; 2) many health problems are easily resolved
so that physicians feel effective; 3) adults who select to
work with children may themselves be more joyful; 4)

pediatricians encounter less "work stress" than other phy-
sicians [25-27].
The 2004-2005 findings again demonstrate the high satis-
faction levels and low dissatisfaction levels for dermatol-
ogy found in the 1996-1997 data. High satisfaction levels
for dermatology may be explained by 1) "prosperous
employment opportunities[28];" 2) opportunities for pre-
serving business through patient self-referral of their own
skin problems; 3) compared to other specialties, derma-
tologists have more stable work hours; 4) outcomes of
treatment are frequently direct and obvious to patients
thus enhancing patient-physician interactions[28].
A change also occurred for ophthalmology. In 1996-1997,
ophthalmology was statistically significant and high on
the list for "dissatisfied" both before and after controlling
for income and other covariates. In the 2004-2005 data,
ophthalmology was statistically significant and positively
associated with satisfaction prior to controlling for covari-
ates (Table 3) but not statistically significant after control-
ling for covariates (Table 5). A literature search and
discussions with local experts did not reveal any obvious
reasons why changes in satisfaction would have occurred
between 1996-1997 and 2004-2005
The low career satisfaction for neurological surgery and
obstetrics and gynecology specialists may have several
causes: irregular hours, medical malpractice lawsuits; loss
of autonomy; and secular decline in pay compared to
other specialties[4,29,30]. This low career satisfaction
might also be explained by the high expectations these
physicians had when they entered these "top tier" special-
ties versus the current realities of practice. When career
expectations are not met, when workers feel cheated, evi-
dence of career dissatisfaction is widespread within most
jobs, not just medical ones[31]. Interestingly, these results
might generalize to other countries. Lambert et al[32] find
evidence that younger physicians in England reject surgi-
cal specialties and obstetrics and gynecology for reasons
relating to "quality of life" and work hours.
Our results on career satisfaction suggest some effect of
lifestyle, especially "uncontrollable" lifestyle. (Bottom of
Table 2 and entire Table 6). If the CTS had information on
three key "controllable" specialties ---anesthesiology,
diagnostic radiology, and pathology---- our multiple
regression results for the "controllable " specialties may
have been stronger. It is worth noting that two of the
"uncontrollable" specialties, pediatrics and internal med-
icine and pediatrics (combined), rank very high on the
satisfaction scale in Tables 2 and 3. Nevertheless, overall,
our results parallel those observed among medical stu-
dents, for whom lifestyle controllability outranked
income as an influence on career choice[8]..
The lack of statistical significance for age 75+ might be
due to the small "n" within that age bracket(1.7% of sam-
ple). The positive and statistically significant results on
the remaining age categories and relatively large coeffi-
cients in the lowest and highest ranges suggested a U-
shaped curve, with physicians age<35 and 65-74 enjoying
the highest levels of satisfaction. This might be due to the
idealism of youth and the fact that most physicians in
retirement age who choose not to retire must enjoy what
they do.
Our statistically insignificant results on gender reflect the
ambiguity in the literature. McMurray et al[33] find
women more dissatisfied than men. Keeton et al[29], on
the other hand, find among physicians practicing obstet-
rics and gynecology, females are more satisfied than
males.
We found statistically insignificant results for non-His-
panic African-Americans. The social science literature on
many other jobs, however, finds African-Americans more
dissatisfied with their jobs[34]. It could be that the medi-
cal profession may be one of the first to achieve racial par-
ity for career satisfaction.
Work hours variables measuring many hours (>60, 51-60
hours-per-week) were strongly and positively associated
with dissatisfaction, similar to the 1996-97 findings.
Work hours appeared to have become an even more
important determinant of satisfaction in 2004-05 than
1996-97, consistent with the hypothesis that physicians
are becoming increasingly concerned with work-life bal-
ance[29].
Unlike the 1996-97 results, these 2004-05 results did not
indicate that graduation from a foreign medical school
was a statistically significant predictor of lower satisfac-
tion. It may be that the shortage of American physicians
has resulted in better career opportunities for interna-
tional medical school graduates[35,36].
Consistent with the 1996-97 results, higher income con-
tinued to be strongly and positively associated with satis-
faction. Income, in fact, appeared to be among the most
consistent of all covariates in both 1996-97 and 2004-05.
This is consistent with economics literature suggesting
that income is the most important predictor for most
jobs[31]. This is also one of the reasons we reported rank-
ings unadjusted for any covariates in Table 3.
The finding that physicians currently employed in medi-
cal schools was unexpected. It could be due to the intrinsic
rewards of intellectual stimulation, collaborative research,
and creative expression associated with academic life[37].

Consistent with the 1996-97 findings, these 2004-2005
findings also indicate a difference for percent of revenue
from managed care. Whereas managed care may be hav-
ing a waning influence on the public, it may continue to
exert influence on physicians[38].
Implications
As indicated in the earlier study,7 these results might be
useful to medical students contemplating specialty
choice. Presumably, medical students might select a spe-
cialty with high rather than low satisfaction, other things
equal.. Specialty societies may also have interest in the
results since they are concerned about the well-being of
current members and the impression new medical stu-
dents have of their specialty.
A free market for physicians would operate to improve the
lowest ranking specialties since employers and payers
would be forced to improve working conditions or wages
to continue to attract high-quality personnel. But free
market forces are weak in the regulated physician market.
Medical group directors, HMO managers, insurance and
Medicare executives, policy makers, and residency direc-
tors, may want to take direct action to improve career sat-
isfaction among specialties that have especially low
scores. Given the strong and consistent relations among
income and work hours on the one hand and satisfaction,
policy suggestions might include raising payments or
reducing work hours for certain specialties. More research
is needed to elucidate the reasons for low satisfaction
within particular specialties in order to develop policy
solutions.
These results may have implications for the future mix of
specialists There may be fewer medical students entering
obstetrics and gynecology or neurological surgery. Given
the critical nature of these specialties, there may also be
implications for public health.
Limitations
First, the data are self-reported. However, only the physi-
cian knows his or her level of satisfaction. Secondly, even
though a subset of the 2004-05 CTS respondents provided
data in earlier survey rounds--with roughly 29% of these
respondents providing data in all three earlier rounds--we
did not perform a longitudinal data analysis on the subset
of respondents who participated in earlier rounds, opting
instead for a cross-sectional analysis of the full 2004-05
sample that provides the most contemporary and straight-
forward look at the broadest range of specialties. It is dif-
ficult to assign causal relations using cross-sectional data.
But many of the results are consistent with causal relations
asserted by other researchers. For example, Clark and
Oswald[31] assert that high income improves satisfaction
and Becker et al[4] assert that changes in the past 20 years
have resulted in growing numbers of dissatisfied obstet-
rics and gynecology physicians. Third, whereas the
response rates may differ across specialties, the CTS
administrators believe these data are representative of
physicians in the nation[17,18].
Another limitation is our use of a single dependent varia-
ble that ranged from +1 to -1. This variable was not nor-
mally distributed and linear regression might result in
predicted values outside the +1 and -1 range. However,
the validity of our regression-based inferences using this
dependent variable ultimately rests on the approximate
normality of our regression coefficients. Although the
quality of this approximation can only be assured by the
Central Limit Theorem asymptotically, (i.e. for arbitrarily
large sample sizes), we have followed standard practices
to promote acceptably accurate approximations[39]. In
particular, our scoring of the response variable increased
the symmetry of its distribution and we purposely
restricted the categorical independent variables in our
analyses to those with moderately large number of
respondents in each category. A separate problem is that
our dependent variable measured satisfaction and dissat-
isfaction along the same scale. It could be that satisfaction
and dissatisfaction are different concepts and require dif-
ferent survey questions for measurement. Alternatively, if
could be that this scaling masks the importance of inde-
pendent variables that have strong but offsetting effects on
both satisfaction and dissatisfaction
A final limitation involves some specialties with few
incumbents. These include pediatric emergency medicine
(n = 29), other medical subspecialties (n = 20), thoracic
surgery (n = 21), critical care internal medicine (n = 29),
hematology and oncology (n = 23), and neurological sur-
gery (n = 24). Caution should be exercised when interpret-
ing results for these specialties.
We are nevertheless confident in the overall results for sev-
eral reasons. First, the CTS data are reliable, highly
regarded, and used in numerous studies[15,17]. Second, a
number of specialties, e.g. pediatrics and obstetrics and
gynecology, are well-known for their satisfaction and dis-
satisfaction and our results coincide with these wide-
spread beliefs. Finally, results on many covariates
(income, hours, managed care) are consistent with other
studies inside and outside medicine[8,31,32,35-37].
Conclusion
Career satisfaction varies by specialty. It is important for
residency directors, policy makers, physicians and medi-
cal students to understand these inter-specialty differences
as they make personal, professional, and policy choices.
