Article
Attitudes have long been considered to be an "indispensable
concept" (Allport, 1935, p. 798) within social psychology,
and with good reason. It is understood that " . . . all aspects
of responding, including emotions, cognitions, and overt
behavior, are infused with the evaluative meaning that atti-
tudes impart" (Eagly & Chaiken, 1998, p. 269). Thus, not
only do attitudes color our evaluations of the social environ-
ment but they provide us with approach and avoidance moti-
vations to guide our interactions within it (e.g., Cacioppo &
Berntson, 1994). Indeed, by virtue of the fact that attitudes
label things (i.e., people, issues, and objects) as positive or
negative they necessarily have implications for action (Eiser
& Fazio, 2008).
However, despite the centrality of the attitude concept to
social psychology (e.g., Ajzen, 2001; Eagly & Chaiken,
1993; Fazio & Petty, 2008) and despite the recognition that
the majority of our likes and dislikes are learned and not
innate (e.g., Rozin & Millman, 1987), the study of how atti-
tudes are initially acquired and shaped by experience has
been relatively neglected (Eiser, Shook, & Fazio, 2007).
Furthermore, where research into attitude formation pro-
cesses has been conducted, this has tended to focus princi-
pally on how attitudes are formed through "passive"
experience--where opportunities to learn occur indepen-
dently of an individual's own behavior (e.g., mere exposure,
see Bornstein, 1989; evaluative conditioning, see De Houwer,
Thomas, & Baeyens, 2001)--with research into attitude for-
mation in "active" or "experiential" learning contexts receiv-
ing less attention (Eiser & Fazio, 2008).
Attitude Formation via Personal
Exploration
Actively establishing what (or where) is good/beneficial or
bad/costly within a given context (i.e., what should be
approached or avoided) necessarily constitutes attitude for-
mation, as we tend to acquire attitudes consistent with our
experiences (Eiser & Fazio, 2008). However, active learning
scenarios present people with a challenge. The world is a
risky place where approach­avoidance decisions are often
made on the basis of incomplete or imperfect information,
which can lead to errors. For instance, wrongly classifying
something as "bad" when it is "good" can mean that some-
thing desirable (e.g., appetizing food) is avoided.
Misclassifying things as "good" when they are "bad" could
mean that undesirable (or even hazardous) things are

Attitude Formation Through Exploration:
The "Treasure Island" Paradigm and the
Significance of Risk Predictability
Christopher R. Jones1 and J. Richard Eiser1
Abstract
Little experimental research has investigated how attitudes are formed via direct personal experience within risky
environments. This report summarizes the development of Treasure Island (TI), an attitude learning paradigm based on
BeanFest. Two studies are reported: The first designed to compare the outcomes of TI with BeanFest; the second to show
how a manipulation of risk predictability would affect attitude learning within the paradigm. Study 1 demonstrated sampling
and learning asymmetries similar to those seen in BeanFest, although the magnitude of these asymmetries was attenuated by
the opportunity for participants to landmark decisions. The manipulation of risk predictability in Study 2 led participants to
seemingly form a less accurate representation of the underlying pay-off contingencies; however, a significant negative learning
asymmetry did persist. The findings of this research (a) identify TI as a versatile paradigm for the investigation of attitude
learning within risky environments and (b) confirm the robust nature of the negative learning asymmetry in contingent-
learning settings; but (c) assert that care should be taken when generalizing the findings of BeanFest to ostensibly more
variable contexts.

approached (e.g., unappetizing or poisonous food).
Importantly, within active learning scenarios, feedback about
things is often tied to approach responses; thus, it is only by
taking a risk and actively sampling or exploring the environ-
ment that we have the opportunity to learn and refine our
appraisal of it. Remaining quiescent, while often less risky,
presents no such learning opportunity.
Thus, when entering a new learning context we must
strike a balance between approach­avoidance motivations to
facilitate goal pursuit (e.g., finding appetizing food) while
minimizing the risk of harm (e.g., eating something disagree-
able). Exactly how we strike and refine this balance depends
upon a number of factors, including personality factors (e.g.,
sensation seeking, see Zuckerman, 1994; regulatory focus,
see Higgins, 1998) and incentive values (e.g., Liberman,
1993). Ultimately, though, it is often our expectancy about
the likely outcome of an approach/avoidance response (based
on previous direct of inferred experience) and how consistent
this is with their current goals, which shapes such decisions
(consistent with expectancy-value theory, for example,
Fazio, Eiser, & Shook, 2004; see also Feather, 1988, 1992).
The BeanFest Studies
The gap in our understanding of attitude learning in active
learning settings prompted Fazio, Eiser, and colleagues (i.e.,
Eiser, Fazio, Stafford, & Prescott, 2003; Fazio et al., 2004) to
develop the BeanFest paradigm. Based on the principles of
reinforcement learning (see Sutton & Barto, 1998), BeanFest
is a two-stage computer-based foraging paradigm that inves-
tigates how attitudes form and generalize toward new stimuli
(in this case beans) where feedback about the nature of stim-
uli (i.e., whether or not they are "good" or "bad") is contin-
gent on the sampling decisions of the learner. For details of
the procedure, see Fazio et al. (2004) or try BeanFest go to:
http://www.millisecond.com/download/samples/
v3/BeanFest/.
One of the key findings from studies using BeanFest is
how biases in approach behavior tend to result in persistent
negative asymmetries in the learning and generalization (see
Eiser & Fazio, 2008; Fazio et al., 2004; Shook, Fazio, &
Eiser, 2007). In short, because participants are motivated to
approach positive beans and avoid negative beans there is a
greater likelihood that they will approach and correct false-
positives (i.e., believing a bad bean is good) than false nega-
tives (i.e., believing a good bean is bad). This means that
correct identification of "bad" beans typically exceeds that of
"good" beans (negative learning asymmetry). Moreover,
consistent with the "negativity bias" (see Cacioppo, Gardner,
& Berntson, 1997; Rozin & Royzman, 2001), participants
typically show a bias toward labeling previously unseen
beans as "bad," even after controlling for the differences in
the learning of the "good" and "bad" beans (negative gener-
alization asymmetry).
Research using BeanFest has yielded pioneering insight
into attitude formation in active learning scenarios and the
implications this holds for the understanding of diverse top-
ics, such as prejudice (Deutsch & Fazio, 2008), political ide-
ology (Shook & Fazio, 2009), depression (Conklin, Strunk,
& Fazio, 2009), emotional reactivity to stressful events
(Pietri, Fazio, & Shook, 2013), and vulnerability to emo-
tional disorders (Shook, Fazio, & Vasey, 2007). However, to
date all experiments utilizing BeanFest have focused on atti-
tude learning in perceptively uncertain but objectively stable,
prescriptive environments; where stimulus valence is
unchanging (i.e., where good beans are always good and bad
beans always bad) and where target stimuli are presented
sequentially (i.e., where each trial constitutes the presenta-
tion of a single bean to participants devoid of other contex-
tual cues that might aid the decision to approach or avoid it).
These parameters pose problems for our broader under-
standing of attitude formation processes in risky experien-
tial-learning scenarios. For example, our social and physical
environments are arguably more variable than presented
within BeanFest, with the availability and/or valence of
desired resources being altered by our or others' interactions
within them (or by the simple passing of time). For example,
Hardin's (1968) "tragedy of the commons" illustrates how
social competition for a limited resource in line with one's
self interests can lead to the overexploitation and rapid
decline in the availability and/or quality of that resource.
Also, it is not always the case we make sequential, isolated
sampling decisions based solely on the features of an indi-
vidual stimulus, but rather we often concurrently utilize
other features or items within the decision-making context to
aid or landmark these sampling decisions (e.g., when choos-
ing groceries, for example, Putrevu & Lord, 2001).
Considerable research both in human and in lower-animal
subjects exists to indicate how both these (and other) factors
can influence real-world foraging and navigation (e.g.,
Bateson & Kacelnik, 1998; Golledge, 1999; Hunt & Waller,
1999; Kamil & Cheng, 2001; Sorrows & Hirtle, 1999; Weber,
Shafir, & Blais, 2004). For instance, cognate research by
Goldstone and colleagues (e.g., Goldstone & Ashpole, 2004;
Goldstone, Ashpole, & Roberts, 2005; Goldstone, Roberts,
& Gureckis, 2008; Roberts & Goldstone, 2006) indicates
how human foraging within two-dimensional virtual envi-
ronments can be negatively affected by the presence of com-
petitors, resulting in sub-optimal sampling behavior (i.e.,
over- and under-matching of available resources) as partici-
pants utilize the foraging decisions of others to help guide
their own decisions. With this in mind, one might hypothe-
size that factors such as the opportunity to landmark one's
sampling decisions could affect the attitude learning and
generalization observed within the paradigm.
In sum, while BeanFest studies have proved invaluable in
strengthening our understanding of how attitudes form and
function in active learning scenarios, the question of whether
or not the central findings from this research (e.g., the learn-
ing and generalization asymmetries) are generalizable to (a)
perceptively more variable contexts, (b) contexts where the
opportunity to concurrently reference (i.e., landmark) one's
Jones and Eiser 3
approach­avoidance decisions against experiences with
other stimuli, and (c) other kinds of target stimuli (i.e., going
beyond beans) remains open.
The principal aim of the current research was to develop
and test a modified version of the BeanFest paradigm capa-
ble of simultaneously investigating these things--this was
achieved through the evolution of the Treasure Island (TI)
paradigm.
The "TI" Paradigm
The TI paradigm (outlined fully below) is purposefully
designed to operate in a largely comparable way to BeanFest;
however, rather than eating or rejecting beans, participants
play the role of an explorer visiting an "island" where they
are required to search for treasure (equivalent to eating
"good" beans) while avoiding pirates (equivalent to avoiding
"bad" beans). The "island" is created by simply overlaying a
depiction of a TI across the 10 × 10 matrix used to determine
the valence of stimuli within BeanFest. This creates a
two-dimensional life-space with three (hidden) positive
regions and three (hidden) negative regions (akin to the
"good" and "bad" families of beans; see Figure 1).
Participants are presented with a full depiction of the TI on
all trials and so have concurrent access to all stimuli when
making their sampling decisions.
Thus, in contrast to BeanFest, (a) stimuli are differenti-
ated by their location in the spatial matrix as opposed to their
individual features (i.e., shape and speckling of beans), (b)
individual sampling decisions can be landmarked against
prior experiences at other locations, and (c) because partici-
pants can be made to believe that the pirates (negative enti-
ties) are either static or mobile, there is an opportunity to
manipulate the perceived environmental consistency and
hence the anticipated risk associated with sampling
decisions.1
The remainder of this article details the development of
the TI paradigm and reports on two studies: the first designed
to assess whether or not the paradigm would produce the pat-
terns in sampling and learning common to BeanFest, thus
Figure 1. Treasure Island: Highlighted within the island are the six experimental regions (3x positive and 3x negative), which are
formally equivalent to the "coordinates" used to generate good and bad beans in BeanFest.( see Fazio et al. 2004).

providing a test of whether the findings of BeanFest can be
generalized to a new stimulus type (in this case, spatial coor-
dinates) and the second designed to investigate how a manip-
ulation of environmental consistency (specifically the
perceived consistency of coordinate valences) would affect
participants' sampling decisions and attitude learning within
the paradigm. The article ends with a consideration of the
research implications and suggestions for further studies.
Study 1: TI and BeanFest Comparison
Study 1 was designed to test whether or not the TI paradigm
would generate similar trends in sampling and learning to
those observed in BeanFest. It was hypothesized that the
similarities between the BeanFest and TI paradigms should
mean that the negative sampling and learning asymmetries
typical of BeanFest should emerge. That is, participants
should show a greater tendency to approach and correct
"false-positive" than "false negative" beliefs within the task,
resulting in more accurate learning and recall of the negative
coordinates versus the positive coordinates (i.e., negative
learning asymmetry).
Method
Participants. A total of 30 (7 male and 23 female) undergrad-
uate and graduate psychology students at the University of
Sheffield, United Kingdom, participated in this study. All
participants had normal or corrected to normal vision, were
aged between 18 and 38 years (M
age
= 21.7 years), and
received partial course credit or  £2 for taking part. Twenty-
nine participants completed the sampling phase (none with
restarts--explained below).
Procedure. TI was designed on a PC using E-Prime (Schnei-
der, Eschman, & Zuccolotto, 2002a, 2002b). All participants
were tested individually in a quiet laboratory cubicle. Upon
arrival, each participant was provided with a series of instruc-
tions about TI. Participants were informed that the task
would comprise two phases: the first taking the form of a
"treasure hunt" in which their aim was to accrue wealth by
sampling the environment (sampling phase); and a second
phase, instructions about which they would receive follow-
ing the treasure hunt (recall phase). Thus, participants were
not informed at this stage that the second phase would con-
stitute a recall task.
Sampling phase: Instructions.Participants were presented
with the treasure map (see Figure 1) and told that the com-
puter would sequentially select coordinates for them to sam-
ple. They were informed that approach responses (made by
pressing "Z" on the keyboard) could meet with one of two
possible outcomes, that is, the discovery of Treasure (+10
coins) or a Pirate Town (-10 coins). They were also told that
avoidance responses (made by pressing "M") would have
no net impact on their accrued wealth, but that they would
not receive feedback as to the valence of the coordinate (i.e.,
feedback was contingent on approach).2
Participants were notified that they would start the task
with 50 virtual coins and that their coins tally would be
updated following each sampling response. There was no
upper limit to the wealth that could be accrued (other than
that predetermined by the number of trials); however, partici-
pants were notified that if they ran out of coins, they would
be evicted from the island and receive instructions relating to
the second phase of the task. Unlike BeanFest, once partici-
pants were evicted from the island they were not restarted,
unless their eviction occurred within the first 10 min of
beginning the task (i.e., upon receiving the instructions).
This 10-min window was introduced to prevent the prema-
ture attrition of participants. Participants evicted during this
time were restarted minus the initial instructions, whereas
participants evicted after this time were thanked for their
time and dismissed.3
In addition to guaranteed course credit or £2 (approx. US
$3) for participating, participants' performance within the
game was also tied to a donation to a local children's charity.
Participants were informed that a donation of 50p would be
made as a result of their participation and that their final
coins tally would be matched with an additional donation
(i.e., 1p for every coin). The charity donation concept was
introduced as pilot studies revealed that guaranteed course
credit was not sufficient to motivate participants within the
task.
Participants then received an automated demonstration of
a sampling-phase trial, before partaking in a short practice
session, comprising six predetermined trials. These six trials
presented one preselected coordinate from each of the six
regions on the island. Participants were encouraged to
approach all six of these coordinates to become familiar with
the outcomes of correct and incorrect approach decisions.
Sampling phase: Test trials.The sampling phase had a 3
(Trial Block: 1, 2, 3) × 2 (Coordinate Valence: Negative vs.
Positive) repeated-measures design. In each block, the 36
target coordinates (18 × positive and 18 × negative, high-
lighted in Figure 1) were presented once to participants. The
presentation order of the coordinates within each block was
randomized except for the first 12 coordinates in Block 1.
These trials were fixed across participants (as in BeanFest,
see Fazio et al., 2004) to reduce the chance of premature evic-
tion from the island. These trials comprised the presentation
of two coordinates from each of the six coordinate clusters.
Following completion of Block 3 (or when the participant
ran out of coins), a screen appeared notifying the participant
of their eviction from the island. Participants were instructed
to inform the experimenter that they had completed Phase 1.
The experimenter made a record of their coin tally before
providing the participant with details of the second phase of
the experiment.
Jones and Eiser 5
Recall phase: Instructions. Participants were informed that
the treasure hunt aspect of the game was over and that their
task was now to recall which coordinates were "good" and
"bad." They were told that they would be presented with a
series of coordinates and that for each one they should indi-
cate whether they thought it would yield treasure (by press-
ing "Z") or a pirate town (by pressing "M"). The computer
then recorded whether the participants' response accurately
matched the actual valence of the coordinate.4
Recall phase: Test trials. On each trial, one coordinate on
the treasure map was highlighted. Written instructions then
appeared, prompting participants to make their judgment.
During the recall phase, the reward and feedback structure of
the sampling phase did not apply and participants received
no feedback as to the "actual" valence of each coordinate.
Participants were required to categorize each of the 36 pre-
sented coordinates, as well as estimate the valence of 34
novel coordinates (comprising 26 coordinates adjacent to
presented locations and 8 unaffiliated coordinates [A10,
D4, E5, E6, F5, F6, G7, J1]). Specifically, participants were
instructed to remember the valence of presented coordinates
and make predictions about the likely valence of the novel
coordinates. It was hoped that responses made within this
phase of the game could be used to establish the extent of
attitude learning within the paradigm and how readily atti-
tudes might generalize.
This recall assessment provides a subjective measure of
participants'evaluation of stimuli (i.e., coordinates) grounded
conceptually within the expectancy-value framework of atti-
tudes (e.g., Fishbein, 1963). As the gaming aspects of the
paradigm have ceased (i.e., participants choices no longer
reflect approach and avoidance decisions) and participants
are simply invited to comment on whether coordinates are
"good" (contain treasure) or "bad" (contain pirates), this
exercise can be seen as a direct measure of participants' atti-
tudes rather than a behavioral index thereof. For a full justi-
fication of this measure of attitude, see Fazio et al. (2004).
Debrief.Participants were first provided with a short
feedback questionnaire asking them to comment on the per-
ceived purpose of the study and whether they had noticed
anything particular about the distribution of treasure and
pirate towns. Participants were then fully debriefed, thanked,
and dismissed.
Results
Sampling phase. A 3 (Block: 1, 2, 3) × 2 (Valence: Negative
vs. Positive) repeated-measures ANOVA yielded main
effects of both Valence, F(1, 28) = 30.66, p < .001, = .52
(large effect size [ES]),5 and Block, F(2, 27) = 11.37, p <
.001, = .46 (large ES), and a significant Block × Valence
interaction, F(2, 27) = 6.45, p < .01, = .32 (large ES). These
results confirmed that sampling behavior was roughly com-
parable with that observed in BeanFest, with a sharp attenu-
ation in the approach of negative stimuli but a relative
maintenance of the approach of positive stimuli over time
(see Figure 2 for visual comparison with Fazio et al., 2004,
experiment 1).
Recall phase.Participants showed above chance recall for
both positive and negative coordinates (ts  3.08, ps < .01, ds
 1.16; large ESs). This confirmed that participants had suc-
cessfully established the location of the majority of treasure
and pirate towns on the island. A significant negative learn-
ing asymmetry was observed, t(28) = 2.06, p < .05, d = 0.39
(small-medium ES), indicating that participants had more
accurate knowledge of the negative coordinates on the island
(see Table 1).
Generalization.
Valence-congruent generalization from
both the positive and negative regions to adjacent novel
coordinates was found to be above chance (ts  3.10, ps <
.01, ds  1.17 [large ESs]) and comparable (i.e., there was no
negative generalization asymmetry). Responses to the eight
non-adjacent coordinates were recoded to reflect the propor-
tion of participants labeled as negative. Labeling of these
coordinates was at chance levels (i.e., 0.50), indicating that
equal numbers were seen to be positive and negative, t(28) =
1.32, p = ns, d = 0.50 (medium ES; see Table 1).6

Discussion
Taken together, the trends in approach and recall in this study
were broadly consistent with those seen in BeanFest.
Participants were able to use the outcomes of their sampling
behavior to learn about the distribution of treasure and pirates
on the island (and adjust their future approach­avoidance
decisions), but a remaining preponderance of incorrect
avoidance choices resulted in a more accurate learning of the
negative coordinates. In contrast to BeanFest, however, no
significant generalization asymmetry was observed within
TI.
While still evident, the learning asymmetry within this
study was smaller than that observed within BeanFest (see
Figure 2). This finding, combined with the lack of a signifi-
cant generalization asymmetry, is perhaps indicative of the
opportunities that participants had to visually reference their
decisions within the task. Specifically, in contrast to
BeanFest, because TI participants could see all coordinates
at all times, it would arguably be easier for them to recognize
(and recall the valence of) presented coordinates and distin-
guish generalization targets as "new." This should have not
only narrowed the expected learning asymmetry but also
should have reduced the likelihood of automatic generaliza-
tion to novel targets based on mistaken identity (i.e., confus-
ing a novel coordinate for a presented one of known valence).
However, despite the apparent advantage offered within
TI by the opportunity to visually reference (i.e., landmark)
sampling decisions, a significant negative learning asymme-
try did still emerge. This finding is of importance as it is
indicative of a generalization of the negativity bias in attitude
formation inherent to BeanFest, not only to a novel stimulus
set (i.e., spatial coordinates) but also to a scenario where the
stimuli can be viewed simultaneously, as opposed to
sequentially.
Taken together, Study 1 confirmed TI as a viable para-
digm for exploring attitude formation, and one that could
produce similar sampling and learning trends to those
observed in BeanFest. We next sought to investigate how a
manipulation of risk predictability might affect these
trends.
Study 2: Risk Predictability
Manipulation
Risk predictability was manipulated by varying participants'
perceptions of the risk of encountering pirates at particular
locations. This was achieved by either informing participants
(correctly) that the pirates would remain in their towns (con-
sistent condition), or (incorrectly) that the pirates could roam
the island and so turn up in a location that had previously
been safe (inconsistent condition). This manipulation was
made without the need for actual changes to the underlying
matrix (i.e., the pirates did not actually roam), allowing for
the direct comparison of participants' responses in percep-
tively stable (consistent) and unstable (inconsistent) versions
of the same task.
It was hypothesized that participants in the consistent
condition should show patterns of sampling and learning
similar to those observed in Study 1.
In the inconsistent condition, the belief that outcome con-
tingencies could change was hypothesized to lead to more
varied search behavior, especially later in the sampling
phase. Specifically, positive locations that had previously
been found to contain treasure might be later avoided on the
grounds that they may now house pirates. Conversely, loca-
tions that had previously been categorized as negative might
be later approached on the grounds that the pirates may have
moved on.
Overall, we anticipated that the greater perceived unpre-
dictability of the environment should result in generally
more sustained approach behavior--and hence greater expe-
rience of actual reward and punishment contingencies--but
with paradoxically poorer learning of actual valence-location
contingencies.
Method

condition. Of the 35 (10 male and 25 female) participants
who took part in the consistent condition, 30 completed the
sampling phase (5 receiving restarts). Of the 35 (7 male and
28 female) participants in the inconsistent condition, 30
completed the sampling phase (6 receiving restarts). The fol-
lowing analyses are performed on the responses of the 60
participants who managed to complete the sampling phase.
Procedure.The procedure was the same as that outlined in
Study 1; however, the instructions were altered so as to
manipulate the apparent mobility of pirates. Specifically,
participants in the consistent condition were (correctly)
informed that pirates were confined to towns and could not
roam the island; while participants in the inconsistent condi-
tion were (incorrectly) informed that the pirates could roam
the island at will.
Results
Manipulation check. A manipulation check was developed to
ensure that the instructions were having the intended effects
on beliefs about risk predictability. This constituted the addi-
tion of a question to the questionnaire preceding the final
debrief, which asked participants to report on the extent to
which they felt that pirates on the island were mobile (1 = not
at all [very static] to 5 = very much so [roam freely]). The
primary manipulation proved successful with participants in
the inconsistent condition considering the pirates to be sig-
nificantly more mobile than those in the consistent condition,
t(48.04) = 3.00, p < .01, d = 0.80 (large ES; see Table 2).
Sampling phase. Participants in the consistent condition sig-
nificantly outperformed those in the inconsistent condition.
Mean coin yield in the inconsistent condition was lower than
that in the consistent condition, t(48.56) = 2.69, p < .01, d =
0.71 (medium-large ES; see Table 2).
Mean positive and negative approach responses within
the sampling phase were compared using a 3 (Block: 1, 2, 3)
× 2 (Valence: Negative vs. Positive) × 2 (Condition:
Consistent vs. Inconsistent) repeated-measures ANOVA.
Two significant main effects (Block and Valence), two 2-way
interactions (Block × Valence; Valence × Condition), and a
3-way interaction (Block × Valence × Condition) were dis-
covered and are discussed below. The main effect of
Condition failed to reach significance, F(1, 58) = 3.36, p =
ns, = .06 (small ES), meaning that overall participants in both
conditions were engaging in a similar amount of approach
behavior across the sampling trials.
The main effect of Valence indicated that, on average,
participants were approaching more positive than negative
coordinates, F(1, 58) = 72.17, p < .001, = .55 (large ES). The
main effect of Block indicated that participants tended to
sample fewer coordinates as the blocks progressed, F(2, 57)
= 23.80, p < .001, = .46 (large ES). These trends were quali-
fied by the Block × Valence interaction, which showed that
levels of sampling of negative coordinates reduced signifi-
cantly more than sampling of positive coordinates over time,
F(2, 57) = 3.70, p < .05, = .12 (medium ES).
The Valence × Condition, F(1, 58) = 7.46, p < .01, = .11
(medium ES), and Block × Valence × Condition, F(2, 57) =
6.70, p < .01, = .19 (medium ES), interactions indicated that
trends in sampling behavior differed by condition. Figure 3
illustrates that, while participants in the consistent condition
showed the sampling pattern typical of BeanFest (i.e., main-
tained positive sampling with a decrease in negative sam-
pling), participants in the inconsistent condition showed a
relative maintenance in the sampling of both positive and
negative areas across time.
A t test revealed that the Block 3 sampling asymmetry
(B3SA; calculated by subtracting Block 3 positive approach
from Block 3 negative approach) in the consistent condition
(M = -0.36; SD = 0.36) was significantly greater than in the
inconsistent condition (M = -0.09; SD = 0.21), t(47.00) =
3.61, p = .001, d = 0.95 (large ES).
The sampling-phase trends (see Figure 3) appeared to
indicate that participants in the inconsistent and consistent
conditions were refining their sampling behavior differently
as a result of the risk predictability manipulation. To further
explore this, a second repeated-measures ANOVA was con-
ducted to specifically contrast the sampling trends between
Blocks 2 and 3.
Blocks 2 and 3 analysis.The ANOVA yielded signifi-
cant main effects of Block, F(1, 58) = 7.34, p < .01, = .11
(medium ES), and Valence, F(1, 58) = 50.90, p < .001, = .47
(large ES). These main effects confirmed that (a) participants
were approaching fewer coordinates in Block 3 than in Block
2 and (b) participants were approaching fewer negative than
positive coordinates. The main effect of condition was not
significant, F(1, 58) = 2.53, p = ns, = .04 (small ES).
While the two-way interactions between Block × Valence
and Block × Condition failed to achieve conventional levels
of significance (Fs  1.63, ps = ns,  .03 [small and non-
significant ESs, respectively]), the two-way Valence ×
Condition interaction, F(1, 58) = 8.28, p < .01, = .13 (medium
ES), and the three-way Block × Valence × Condition interac-
tion, F(1, 58) = 10.82, p < .01, = .16 (medium ES), did. These
latter significant interactions indicated that there was a dif-
ference between the consistent and inconsistent conditions in
the manner in which positive and negative approach behav-
ior was refined between the second and third blocks.

Paired samples t tests revealed that for the consistent con-
dition, between Blocks 2 and 3, approach of positive coordi-
nates was statistically comparable, t(29) = 0.81, p = ns, d =
0.15 (non-significant ES), whereas approach of negative
coordinates significantly reduced, t(29) = 3.30, p < .01, d =
0.60 (medium ES). By contrast, in the inconsistent condition
participants' approach of positive coordinates significantly
reduced, t(29) = 2.44, p < .05, d = 0.52 (medium ES), whereas
approach of negative coordinates remained statistically com-
parable, t(29) = 0.35, p = ns, d = 0.05 (non-significant ES).
Mediation analysis: Pirate-mobility manipulation on Block 3 sam-
pling.
A mediation analysis was conducted to establish
whether the relationship between condition and the size of
the B3SA was mediated by the manipulation of perceived
risk predictability (i.e., pirate mobility).
Multiple regression analyses were first conducted to
assess each component of the proposed mediation model.
Condition (dummy coded: consistent = 0; inconsistent = 1)
was negatively associated with B3SA, B = -.27, t(58) = 3.61,
p < .001, R2 = .18, f2 = .22 (medium-large ES). Condition was
positively associated with perceptions of pirate mobility, B =
.93, t(58) = 3.00, p < .01, R2 = .13, f2 = .15 (medium ES). The
mediator, pirate mobility, was negatively associated with the
B3SA, B = -.11, t(58) = 3.72, p < .001, R2 = .28, f2 = .39
(large ES).
Because both the a-path and b-path were significant,
mediation analysis of the indirect effect was conducted using
5,000 bootstrapped resamples using bias-corrected 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs; Preacher & Hayes, 2004, 2008). The
direct effect of condition on B3SA reduced in size when con-
trolling for perceived pirate mobility, B = -.17, t(58) = 2.35,
p < .05, although remained significant. The mediation analy-
sis confirmed pirate mobility as a partial mediator of the rela-
tionship between condition and B3SA, B = -.10, CI = [-0.19,
-0.04]. See Figure 4 for the mediation diagram.7
Recall accuracy.Participants in the consistent condition
showed more accurate recall of positive coordinates,
t(53.25) = 2.55, p < .05, d = 0.65 (medium-large ES), than
those in the inconsistent condition. There was a similar,
although not significant, trend toward more accurate recall
of negative coordinates in the consistent condition versus
the inconsistent condition also, t(58) = 1.88, p = .06, d =
0.50 (medium ES).
Recall of positive and negative coordinates exceeded
chance (i.e., 0.50) in the consistent condition, ts  4.58, ps <
.001, ds  1.70 (large ESs). While only recall of negative
coordinates was above chance in the inconsistent condition,
t(29) = 6.34, p < .001, d = 1.70 (large ES); there was also a
trend toward greater than chance recall of the positive coor-
dinates, t(29) = 1.93, p = .06, d = 0.72 (medium-large ES).
Participants in both conditions demonstrated evidence of
a bias toward more accurate recall of negative coordinates (ts
 2.78, ps < .01, ds  0.50 [medium ESs]). The size of the

Block 3 sampling and recall correlations. Correlations were run
to see whether "accurate" sampling decisions in Block 3
(i.e., positive approach and negative avoidance) were signifi-
cantly related to levels of accurate positive and negative
recall, respectively. The results of the consistent condition
revealed a significant correlation between accurate sampling
and both positive and negative recall, rs (30)  .60, ps < .001
(large ESs). Conversely, there was no significant correlation
between accurate sampling and recall in the inconsistent con-
dition, rs (30)  .33, ps = ns (medium and small ESs).
Mediation analysis: Pirate-mobility manipulation on coordinate
recall accuracy.To assess whether the differences in recall
accuracy between the conditions was mediated by the manip-
ulation of perceived pirate mobility, a further mediation anal-
ysis was run. This used the mean proportion of accurate
positive and negative coordinate recall (mean recall) as the
dependent variable.
Initial multiple regression analyses revealed that condi-
tion (consistent = 0; inconsistent = 1) was negatively associ-
ated with mean recall, B = -.011, t(58) = 2.61, p < .05, R2 =
.11, f2 = .12 (medium ES). Condition was positively associ-
ated with perceptions of pirate mobility, B = .93, t(58) = 3.00,
p < .01, R2 = .13, f2 = .15 (medium ES). Estimates of pirate
mobility were negatively associated with the mean recall, B
= -.05, t(58) = 3.20, p < .01, R2 = .21, f2 = .27 (medium-large
ES).
Mediation analysis of the indirect effect was conducted
using 5,000 bootstrapped resamples using bias-corrected
95% CIs (Preacher & Hayes, 2004, 2008). The direct effect
of condition on mean recall became non-significant, B =
-.06, t(58) = 1.44, p = ns, when controlling for perceived
pirate mobility. The mediation analysis confirmed pirate
mobility as a mediator of the relationship between condition
and mean recall (B = -.05, CI = [-0.092, -0.018]). See
Figure 5 for the mediation diagram.8
Generalization
Independent samples t tests revealed that participants in the
consistent and inconsistent conditions showed equivalent
levels of "positive generalization" and equivalent levels of
"negative generalization" (ts  1.66, ps = ns, ds  0.42
[small-medium ESs]; see Table 1 for means). Levels of "neg-
ative generalization" were above chance (i.e., 0.50) in both
conditions (ts  3.25, ps < .01, ds  1.21 [large ESs]); how-
ever, "positive generalization" only exceeded chance in the
consistent condition, t(29) = 2.60, p < .05, d = 0.97 (large
ES); inconsistent, t(29) = 0.95, p = ns, d = 0.35 (small ES).
The positive and negative generalization asymmetry was not
significant in either condition (ts  1.89, ps = ns, ds  0.29
[small ESs]).
Responses to the eight non-adjacent coordinates were
recoded to reflect the proportion that participants labeled as
negative. In both conditions, the labeling of these coordi-
nates was at chance levels (i.e., 0.50), meaning that there was
no overall negativity bias in the labeling of these coordinates
(ts  0.12, ps = ns, ds  0.05 [non-significant ESs]).9
Discussion
The results of Study 2 indicated that the manipulation of per-
ceived risk predictability had, in the absence of any actual
underlying change to the TI matrix, prompted marked differ-
ences in the sampling behavior and recall accuracy of partici-
pants in the consistent and inconsistent conditions.
Participants in the consistent condition showed sampling-
phase trends, recall accuracies, and generalization tendencies
consistent with having established a reasonably accurate rep-
resentation of the good and bad locations. While no significant

generalization asymmetry was observed (akin to Study 1),
there were significant negative asymmetries in Block 3 sam-
pling and recall. These trends indicated how sampling behav-
ior within the paradigm (and hence learning) was being
governed by expected outcomes at the presented locations, a
result supported by the significant correlations between
"accurate" Block 3 sampling behavior and recall within this
condition. Consistent with Study 1, it was also evident that
the residual preponderance of false-negative beliefs resulted
in less accurate recall of the positive coordinates.
By contrast, participants in the inconsistent condition
showed evidence of apparently more maladaptive sampling
behavior (particularly between Blocks 2 and 3) and poorer
recall compared with the consistent condition, suggesting
that the risk predictability manipulation had disrupted atti-
tude learning. Indeed, the lack of significant correlations
between sampling and recall within this condition suggested
that participants were not as readily matching the outcomes
of their accurate sampling behavior in Block 3 with congru-
ent recall responses.
Interestingly, while general recall accuracy was lower in
the inconsistent condition compared with the consistent con-
dition, a negative learning asymmetry did persist. This asym-
metry was ostensibly the result of the risk predictability
manipulation having had a marked impact on participants'
learning of positive versus negative locations. We argue that
the sampling strategy employed by participants in the incon-
sistent condition offers an explanation for the retention of
this asymmetry.
First, if participants did believe that the island was change-
able during the sampling phase, then their resultant tenden-
cies to avoid returning to positive areas (believing them to be
negative) and to re-approach negative areas (believing them
to be positive) should have served to directly decrease and
increase their actual experience of positive and negative
location contingencies, respectively. Second, the continued
experience of negative outcomes at areas thought to have
been vacated by pirates (from an incorrect approach of nega-
tive coordinates) should have led to a belief among partici-
pants in the inconsistent condition that the environment was
negatively biased. Both experiences would have likely
inflated negative responding relative to positive responding
in the recall phase.
It is clear, then, that the manipulation of risk predictability
did have a notable impact on sampling trends and recall
responses relative to seemingly more stable versions of the
TI task. However, while we contend that the findings from
Study 2 support the original hypothesis accompanying this
study (i.e., that participants in the inconsistent condition had
genuinely developed less accurate representations of the
valence-location contingencies relative to those in the con-
sistent condition), there is a competing explanation for the
findings that would argue that the detriment shown in sam-
pling and recall within the inconsistent condition was more
apparent than real.
Within the sampling phase of the inconsistent condition,
for instance, if participants were convinced that the environ-
ment was changeable, you might predict that those who had
developed an accurate representation of the underlying
matrix (perhaps equivalent to that of the consistent condi-
tion) should show poor sampling accuracy. In other words,
poor sampling accuracy should be expected if participants
had established where the good and bad locations were but
who were then erroneously updating their approach behav-
iors based on the assumption that the valence of these loca-
tions had changed.10 Similarly, within the recall phase, if
participants were making predictions about the likely future
valence of locations as opposed to simply recalling their last
experiences at these locations, then this might also be antici-
pated to artificially lower recall accuracy within the inconsis-
tent condition (this issue is dealt with further in the general
discussion).
In sum, while we conclude that the trends in sampling and
recall are indicative of participants in the inconsistent condi-
tion having poorer learning of the valence-location contin-
gencies, we concede that further research is required to
disentangle the extent to which this detriment is genuine.
General Discussion
The present research developed a modified version of the
BeanFest paradigm which we used to investigate how people
might form attitudes toward spatial location within a percep-
tively variable active learning scenario (i.e., where the pre-
dictability of risk could be manipulated) but one in which
they could landmark their approach­avoidance decisions.
Study 1 illustrated that trends in sampling and learning in the
new TI paradigm were broadly consistent with those seen in
BeanFest studies (e.g., Eiser & Fazio, 2008; Fazio et al.,
2004; Shook, Fazio, & Eiser, 2007); however, no significant
generalization asymmetry was observed. Study 2 revealed
how a simple manipulation of perceived (not actual) risk pre-
dictability was apparently sufficient to disrupt participants'
learning of the actual underlying valence-location contingen-
cies, although the extent to which this detriment is real or
apparent should be resolved through further research.
The results of Study 1 are important in illustrating the
generalization of the negative learning asymmetry inherent
to BeanFest to (a) an ostensibly easier learning environment
(i.e., where participants could landmark their approach­
avoidance decisions) and (b) a task using a qualitatively dif-
ferent kind of stimulus (i.e., spatial location vs. beans). We
suggest that this is indicative of the robust nature of this
asymmetry under perceptively stable conditions.
We argue that the opportunity to landmark approach­
avoidance decisions within TI explains the lack of the emer-
gence of a clear generalization asymmetry. Unlike BeanFest,
it would have been easier for TI participants to recognize
generalization coordinates as new, thus limiting automatic
generalization based on mistaken identity (i.e., mistaking a
Jones and Eiser 11
novel bean of unknown valence for a presented bean of
known valence due to visual similarities). We contend that
this finding is indicative that the generalization asymmetry
inherent to BeanFest is, at least in part, tied to the decision to
sequentially present stimuli--as people are required to retro-
spectively recall rather than simultaneously reference their
decisions.
The results of Study 2 indicate the apparently detrimental
impact that perceived risk predictability has on attitude
learning and, in doing so, assert that one should take care
when generalizing the findings from BeanFest to situations
where the environment and the objects therein are percep-
tively more variable. Our research suggests that within per-
ceptively variable environments, the translation of experience
into learning is slower and less clearly defined than posited
by the results of studies employing the BeanFest paradigm.
That having been said, even within this perceptively more
variable context, the negative learning asymmetry common
to BeanFest did still emerge. We argue that this finding is
thus indicative of the transferability of this asymmetry to
perceptively less stable learning contexts.
Paradigm Limitations and Future Research
While the research outcomes from these studies may hold
some relevance for our understanding of judgment and deci-
sion making (JDM) in risky situations (for a discussion of the
research challenges in this field, see Rakow & Newell, 2010)
and human foraging behavior (e.g., Goldstone & Ashpole,
2004; Goldstone et al., 2005), we reason that they are most
valuable for (a) enhancing our understanding of "active" atti-
tude formation within ostensibly variable environments and
(b) producing a tool for further expanding our understanding
of this under-researched field of psychology. However, bear-
ing in mind the novelty of this paradigm and the limitations
in the studies outlined, there remains a number of interesting
research opportunities in this area. We outline a few of these
below.
Changes to the task instructions
Obedience to authority.Building on the early findings
of Fazio, Eiser, and colleagues (Eiser et al., 2007; Fazio et
al., 2004, Experiment 5), these studies highlight the influ-
ence that an individuals' beliefs about a learning environ-
ment can have on their perception of actual reinforcement
contingencies experienced. Notably, within the inconsistent
condition, participants appeared to give greater credence to
the expected outcomes (based on the indirect information
provided at the start of the task), rather than their directly
experienced outcomes at these locations. Indeed, within this
condition people were seemingly less able to overcome the
(incorrect) advice provided to them before commencing the
task, resulting in significantly poorer performance.
It is possible that this finding is related to the fact that the
task instructions came from the experimenter, whom
participants perhaps saw as either an expert and/or as unlikely
to provide incorrect information. It could be hypothesized
that if the instructions was seen as coming from a less author-
itative source (e.g., other participants, for example, Eiser et
al., 2007; Fazio et al., 2004) that people might have more
quickly overcome the inaccuracies in the advice provided
and would thus show sampling and recall patterns consistent
with better learning.
Equally, however, this finding may stem from a conflict
between motivation and learning within this perceptively
more complex version of TI (see discussion of Yerkes-
Dodson Law, for example, Hanoch & Vitouch, 2004;
Liberman, 1993; Teigen, 1994). Specifically, the perceived
complexity of the inconsistent condition could have led par-
ticipants to complete the task in a narrower, more piecemeal
fashion than those in the consistent condition. This might
have resulted in a kind of "confused chasing" of individual
pay-offs and difficulties in recognizing the broader regional
contingencies present within the life-space (see Ert & Erev,
2007).
We argue that a formal investigation of (a) how the per-
ceived source of the instructions and advice within the task
influences sampling and recall trends and (b) the interactions
between motivation and attitude learning within a TI or
BeanFest type scenario could provide fruitful avenues for
future research in this field.
The impact of inconsistency: Poorer learning or experimen-
tal artifact?We have concluded that the manipulation of
risk predictability in Study 2 led to a poorer leaning of the
actual location-valence contingencies among participants in
the inconsistent condition as compared with the consistent
condition. This conclusion would appear to fit both with the
more indiscriminate sampling and poorer recall accuracy
shown in this condition. However, we have also discussed
the possibility that the detriment within the inconsistent
condition could be more apparent than real. This alterna-
tive explanation could be strengthened by limitations in the
instructions accompanying the recall task.
In short, while the instructions accompanying the recall
task asked participants to remember which areas were "good"
and "bad" (i.e., insinuating that the participants should recall
their last experiences at each location), it is possible that
some participants believed that this instruction was asking
them to predict future outcomes at each location (as was the
case of novel coordinates presented during this phase). If this
was the case, and if those in the inconsistent condition main-
tained a belief that the environment was changeable, then
this could help to explain the lower recall accuracy in this
condition. That is, while participants in both conditions may
have had an equivalent appreciation of the pay-off matrix at
the end of the sampling phase (i.e., may have shown equiva-
lent learning), those in the inconsistent condition may have
been less trusting of this knowledge in predicting future
experiences at given locations. Thus, if these participants'
12 SAGE Open
recall responses were reflective of anticipated future out-
comes at visited locations (not intended) rather than their
most recent experience at these locations (intended), this
could have artificially lowered recall accuracy in this
condition.
Future research could usefully adapt the TI procedure to
formally investigate this possibility. This could be achieved
by a simple rephrasing of the recall instructions to ensure
that participants focus on their last known experience at each
location. These responses could then be compared with those
from a secondary task where participants are invited more
explicitly to make predictions about the future valence of
each location. One would anticipate that accuracy should be
similarly poor in both "recall" and "prediction" tasks if the
risk predictability manipulation has resulted in genuinely
poorer learning; but that "recall" should be superior to "pre-
diction" (and on par with responses in the consistent condi-
tions), if the effect of the manipulation is more artifactual.
Creating a more realistic foraging space
Actual versus implied change to stimulus valence. TI is not
a traditional foraging paradigm in the sense that partici-
pants do not personally navigate the environment to identify
resources but are, akin to BeanFest, presented with a pre-
selected series of stimuli in a randomized order. Moreover,
within the current studies, the manipulation of risk predict-
ability was achieved through a variations in the information
provided to participants only and not through actual changes
to the underlying pay-off matrix.
While both factors could be seen to undermine the eco-
logical validity of the findings, these design decisions were
purposeful so as to ensure a broad underlying comparability
to all test conditions (i.e., all participants had the same poten-
tial to have the same experiences within the task). Also,
while there was no underlying change to the pay-off matrix,
it was reasoned that the predictability manipulation should
be self-propagating and would thus not require us to make
such changes. Specifically, to the extent that participants
were basing their decisions on the expected outcomes, the
self-generation and subsequent approach of false-positive
beliefs (generated by the manipulation of environmental
consistency) should have enhanced the perception of the
environment as changeable.
Participants in the inconsistent condition did believe the
pirates to be more mobile in comparison with the consistent
condition; however, estimates of mobility within this condi-
tion were fairly moderate. This is presumably because of the
actual underlying stability of the pay-off matrix and the tim-
ing of the manipulation check (i.e., the manipluation check
took place after the TI task was complete and so participants
may have established that the pirates were immobile). It is
likely, therefore, that the results of the risk predictability
manipulation observed within this research are moderate
compared with those that would be expected from studies
where the predictability threat is real (i.e., where the pay-off
matrix does vary).
Future research should thus investigate to what extent
attitude learning is affected within actually variable contexts
and/or where participants are more able to select the order in
which they experience stimuli, akin to more real-world
foraging.
The impact of resource depletion on attitude learning.Real-
world foragers must often contend with resource deple-
tion, for example, as inter- and intra-species competition
for resources alters the availability of these resources (e.g.,
Goldstone et al., 2005; Goldstone et al., 2008). Future stud-
ies might investigate how resource depletion (i.e., the pre-
dictability of reward) might affect on sampling decisions and
attitude formation within the paradigm. This manipulation
could be achieved either by altering the actual availability
of resources (i.e., treasure) on the island or, akin to Study
2, by altering participants' perceptions about the availability
of treasure on the island (e.g., informing them that treasure
yielding coordinates might have less/no treasure once sam-
pled).
One key feature of TI that would aid such investigation is
that it lessens the rigid "resource-trial" contingency present
in BeanFest. As opposed to BeanFest where for each trial
participants must choose to approach (eat) or avoid (not eat)
individual beans, TI presents participants with spatial coordi-
nates that could feasibly contain variable amounts of a
desired resource (e.g., lots of treasure or not much treasure)
that could be seen to deplete as a result of sampling
decisions.
Investigating individual differences and other applications
The impact of personality and individual differences.The
BeanFest and TI studies indicate that attitude learning within
contingent-feedback scenarios is (a) related to the approach
and avoidance decisions of participants; and (b) influenced
not only by the information provided to participants but
also by state and trait individual differences (e.g., Conklin
et al., 2009; Fazio et al., 2004; Pietri et al., 2013; Shook &
Fazio, 2009). For example, Fazio et al. (2004, Experiment 3)
showed that priming people to be more promotion or preven-
tion focused within BeanFest resulted in smaller and larger
negative learning asymmetries, respectively. Furthermore,
Shook and Fazio (2009) discovered that political conserva-
tism related to more avoidant strategies in BeanFest, result-
ing in a stronger learning asymmetry compared with those
with a more liberal political ideology.
The TI paradigm offers further opportunity to investigate
how individual differences might interact with attitude learn-
ing, particularly within less-predictable contexts. Of particu-
lar interest here could be traits relating to an individual's
tolerance of uncertainty; for example, low ambiguity toler-
ance (Furnham & Ribchester, 1995), high need for closure
(Webster & Kruglanski, 1994), and high personal need for
structure (Neuberg & Newsom, 1993). These personality
characteristics have been linked to a number of impression
formation biases (e.g., the correspondence bias and
Jones and Eiser 13
erroneous group stereotyping) as people attempt to ascribe
order to their social world (see also Schaller, Boyd,Yohannes,
& O'Brien, 1995). Feasibly, the TI paradigm could be uti-
lized to explore how these characteristics might facilitate or
impede attitude learning within variable environments,
which could have implications for our understanding of prej-
udice formation and transmission.
Intergroup prejudice.Relatedly, the TI paradigm could
provide a better platform for assessing the formation and
function of attitudes toward more socially relevant stimuli
(e.g., individuals, groups) than BeanFest. The TI theme argu-
ably makes the experimental scenario more social than that
presented by BeanFest. That is, rather than approaching and
avoiding "beans," participants enter a dynamic intergroup
setting where they run the risk of approaching a threaten-
ing group of people (in this case pirates). While variations of
BeanFest have been utilized to draw inferences about inter-
group processes (e.g., stereotyping; Deutsch & Fazio, 2008),
we contend that TI provides a more appropriate conceptual
platform for investigating such issues due to the more social
nature of the exploratory context,.
Future research could, for instance, focus on how preju-
dice reduction strategies might affect the formation, mainte-
nance, and transmission of the negative learning and
generalization asymmetries common to this research (see
Paluck & Green, 2009). One might anticipate that strategies
promoting greater openness to interactions with outgroups
(e.g., imagined contact; Crisp & Turner, 2009) could serve to
increase sampling behavior, thus reducing the size of these
asymmetries.
Conclusion
The aim of these studies was to advance understanding of
attitude formation processes via direct personal experience
within ostensibly risky environments through the develop-
ment and testing of a new computer-based paradigm based
on BeanFest (i.e., TI). The findings of Study 1 support the
pioneering research achieved using the BeanFest paradigm,
illustrating how an apparent failure to correct for false-nega-
tive beliefs results in the emergence of negative learning
asymmetry. However, it would appear that provision of an
opportunity to visually landmark decisions attenuates the
size of this asymmetry and limits the extent of generalization
from learning experiences. Meanwhile, the results of Study 2
indicate how a verbal manipulation of risk predictability can
serve to disrupt sampling behavior and recall in the task.
Taken together the findings of this research would appear
to confirm the robust nature of the negative learning asym-
metry in contingent-learning settings but simultaneously
argue that care should be taken when seeking to generalizing
the findings of BeanFest studies to ostensibly more variable
contexts and/or those where participants can more easily
landmark their decisions. This is an important finding being
that real-world environments are perceptively (and often
actually) (a) more changeable than BeanFest asserts; and (b)
often offer more opportunity for people to reference their
decisions than is provided in the BeanFest paradigm. We
hope that TI will be further utilized and developed to further
advance research in this presently under-investigated field of
attitude research.

Notes
 1. While the option of varying the perceived consistency of target
stimuli could be investigated within BeanFest (e.g., by inform-
ing participants that beans could ripen or rot over time); the
Treasure Island (TI) paradigm allows for a more parsimonious
investigation of this manipulation within an experimental con-
text that can be used to investigate the other factors of interest
to the current research.
2. Participants were encouraged to actively approach or avoid
coordinates by pressing the "Z" and "M" keys. If no response
was made within 60 s of the stimulus presentation, this was
treated as a nil response. There were no sampling-phase nil
responses within the studies presented in this article.
3. The instructions and practice took approx. 5-7 min to com-
plete. The restart window for evictees would thus have covered
the instructions, the practice trials, and a small proportion of
Block 1 sampling (mainly the first 12-fixed moves). Restarted
evictees should therefore not have accrued a significant learn-
ing advantage over non-restarters. By contrast, evictees fall-
ing outside this window may have (a) accrued too much of a
comparative advantage over others or (b) completed too few
sampling trials to participate fairly in the recall phase. Hence,
their eviction was final and their data were removed.
4. If no response was made within 10 s, this was treated as an
incorrect labeling of the target coordinate. Nil responding
was rare: In Study 1, only two nil responses were recorded,
whereas in Study 2 there was one nil response in the inconsis-
tent condition and three in the consistent condition.
 5. Effect size (ES) magnitude inferences were made according
to Cohen (1988, 1992): (partial eta-squared) and f2 (Cohen's
f2) = .02 (small), .13 (medium), .26 (large); d (Cohen's d)
= 0.20 (small), 0.50 (medium), 0.80 (large); r (Pearson's
r) = .10 (small), .30 (medium), .50 (large). Where an
14 SAGE Open
ES is termed "non-significant," this refers to statistical
significance.
 6. There were two nil responses in non-adjacent coordinate label-
ing. Even when accounting for this, the difference from chance
remained non-significant (M = 0.44, SD = 0.27), t(28) = 1.19,
p = ns, d = 0.45 (medium ES).
 7. It is likely that the strength of this mediation was affected by
the timing of when participants provided estimates of pirate
mobility. Participants only made such estimates at the end
of the TI task, at a time when they might have learned that
the pirates were less mobile than thought. A secondary boot-
strapped mediation confirmed that learning (as assessed by
the B3SA) did mediate the relationship between condition
and estimates of pirate mobility (c path: p < .004; c path: p
< .167). Future research should thus seek to clarify the theo-
retical impact of the predictability manipulation on learning
by having participants assess pirate mobility at an earlier time
point(s) within the task.
8. See Note 6 for a potential weakness with this mediation
analysis.
 9. There was one nil response in non-adjacent coordinate label-
ing. Even when accounting for this, the difference from chance
remained non-significant (M = 0.49, SD = 0.19), t(29) = 0.18,
p = ns, d = 0.07 (non-significant ES).
10. Sampling trends were statistically comparable between the
conditions in Blocks 1 and 2, only diverging significantly
between Blocks 2 and 3. Arguably, this could be taken as evi-
dence that the participants in each condition had equivalent
learning of the matrix by Block 2 but then applied this learning
differently on later trials (Block 3).
