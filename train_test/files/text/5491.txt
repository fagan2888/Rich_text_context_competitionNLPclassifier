ABSTRACT
The molecular requirements for human myelination are in-
completely defined, and further study is needed to fully un-
derstand the cellular mechanisms involved during develop-
ment and in demyelinating diseases. We have established
a human co-culture model to study myelination. Our earlier
observations showed that addition of human -carboxylated
growth-arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) to human oligoden-
drocyte progenitor cell (OPC) cultures enhanced their survival
and maturation. Therefore, we explored the effect of Gas6 in
co-cultures of enriched OPCs plated on axons of human fe-
tal dorsal root ganglia explant. Gas6 significantly enhanced
the number of myelin basic protein-positive (MBP+ ) oligo-
dendrocytes with membranous processes parallel with and
ensheathing axons relative to co-cultures maintained in de-
fined medium only for 14 days. Gas6 did not increase the
overallnumberofMBP+ oligodendrocytes/culture;however,
it significantly increased the length of MBP+ oligodendro-
cyte processes in contact with and wrapping axons. Multiple
oligodendrocytes were in contact with a single axon, and sev-
eral processes from one oligodendrocyte made contact with
one or multiple axons. Electron microscopy supported confo-
cal Z-series microscopy demonstrating axonal ensheathment
by MBP+ oligodendrocyte membranous processes in Gas6-
treated co-cultures. Contacts between the axonal and oligo-
dendrocyte membranes were evident and multiple wraps
of oligodendrocyte membrane around the axon were vis-

INTRODUCTION
Myelination is essential for efficient ensheathment and in-
sulation of axons allowing for enhanced axonal conduc-
tance and transport. While a great deal of our understanding
of myelination comes from studying rodent model systems,
there is an incomplete understanding of how efficient myeli-
nation is achieved during human development, and repar-
ative processes occurring subsequent to neurologic diseases
in the central nervous system (CNS). This lack of knowledge
has hampered our understanding of how to optimize treat-
ment for humans. Unlike rodent oligodendrocytes, human
oligodendrocytes do not synthesize mature myelin proteins
in the absence of axons. Several studies show that addi-
tional factors that enhance survival, maturation and myeli-
nation in human-derived models are required. Our goal was
to combine growth factors that enhance oligodendrocyte
progenitor cell (OPC) survival and maturation to generate a
human co-culture model that expresses myelin-synthesizing

proteins resulting in myelination. Our earlier studies deter-
mined that a vitamin K-dependent protein, growth-arrest-
specific protein 6 (Gas6), is a survival/maturation factor for
human O4+ OPCs. When maintained in platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF)-containing medium in the absence of
Gas6 there was significant apoptosis 6 days post-plating. The
addition of 5.6 nM recombinant human Gas6 prolonged sur-
vival and promoted the expression of 2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide
3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) protein (Shankar et al., 2003,
2006).
Gas6, detected in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) (Sainaghi
et al., 2008, 2013), and expressed in neurons and stem
cells, can signal through the mitogen-activated protein ki-
nase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. In the ner-
vous system, Gas6 is expressed and secreted by several
types of neurons including motor neurons in spinal cord and
large neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (Li et al.,
1996; Allen et al. 1999). Gas6 and its receptors are expressed
widely in the CNS, and the interaction between Gas6 and its
receptors have physiologically relevant function (Crosier and
Crosier, 1997; Avanzi et al., 1998; Allen et al., 1999; Prieto
et al., 1999, 2000; Tsiperson et al., 2010; Binder et al., 2011;
Weinger et al., 2011).
Gas6 is a ligand for the Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) family
of receptor tyrosine kinase. The relative affinity of Gas6 for
its receptors is Axl>Tyro3>Mer. In situ hybridization stud-
ies performed in rat CNS demonstrated that members of the
TAM family are expressed on neurons and in white matter
during myelination (Allen et al., 1999; Prieto et al., 2000).
Transcription of Axl and Tyro3 are increased in the presence
of nerve growth factor (NGF), the growth factor essential for
healthy axonal outgrowth (Gundersen and Barrett, 1979). RTÂ­
PCR studies showed that Axl, Tyro3, and Mer are expressed
in human O4+ oligodendrocytes (OLs), cultured fetal human
microglia, and all three RNAs are expressed in human fetal
brain and spinal cord (Shankar et al., 2003), and in the ro-
dent CNS (Prieto et al., 2000). We proposed that Gas6 ligand
receptor interaction enhances signaling between axons and
OLs during myelination. By combining growth factors that
enhance survival and maturation of human OLs and neurons
we have generated a human co-culture system that expresses
mature myelin proteins and can be further manipulated for
a more complete understanding of human myelination.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human fetal tissue including spinal cord, DRG and brain were
obtained from the Human Fetal Tissue Repository as approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Albert Einstein College
of Medicine and state and federal laws.
DRG explant cultures
DRGs were prepared from specimens 15 gw. DRGs
were stripped of meninges, placed on previously prepared
coverslips (12 mm) coated with diluted (1:7) growth
factor-reduced Matrigel (356230; BD Biosciences) and
covered with 300 l of NB (neurobasal)/F medium. NB/F
consists of NB medium containing 2% B27 (Gibco),
4 mg/ml D-glucose (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco),
1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco), 50 ng/ml NGF (Harlan)
supplemented with 10 M 5-fluorodioxyuridine and uridine
(Sigma) (Chan et al., 2004; Taveggia et al., 2008; Wang et al.,
2012). Cultures were maintained at 37C in 5% CO2.
Every
3 days, the medium was alternated with NB medium, NBF
medium minus 5-fluorodioxyuridine and uridine. After three
alternate feeds in NBF and NB, the DRGs were maintained in
NB until axons radiating from the explant reached the edges
of the coverslip. The total time frame was 3 weeks. All
DRG explant cultures selected for co-culture were of similar
axonal density.
Enrichment of OPCs
OPCs were prepared from mixed glial cultures of brain 16
gw. The fetal mixed glial culture was established from fetal
brain tissue 3weeks after the DRGs were plated (Jana et al.,
2007; Taveggia et al., 2008). Mixed glial cells were grown
in poly-D-lysine-coated T-75 flasks in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 plus 10% FCS for 9 days. An
initial 2 h shake-off at 240 rev./min was performed to re-
move the microglia and fresh medium was added. On day
11, an 18 h overnight shake-off at 180 rev./min was per-
formed to remove the OPCs from the adherent monolayer.
Prior to plating on the DRG explant the nonadherent OPCs
from the shake-off were purified by two rounds of plating
on uncoated tissue culture dishes for 1 h at 37C, 5% CO2,
to further eliminate contaminating microglia, and plated on
the DRG (see below).
Direct isolation of OPCs from human fetal brain mixed
glial cultures was the best method for preserving the integrity
of OPCs for co-culture. We did not find immunopanning
to be better than the direct isolation of enriched OPCs.
By reducing the amount of manipulation we observed an
increase in the total number of viable OPCs, and minimized
cell death. All lineage-committed OLs express IV
tubulin
(Terada et al., 2005). Immunohistochemical examination of
enriched OPC cultures determined that 95% of the cells
were positive for PDGFR, the transcription factor Olig2
and IV
tubulin. There were 5% GFAP+ astrocytes and no
detectable Iba1+ microglia.
OPC/DRG co-cultures
Unless otherwise noted, enriched OPCs purified from mixed
glial cultures were immediately plated without further cul-
turing on to the DRG explant at 1Ã105 cells/well in de-
fined medium consisting of DMEM high-glucose medium
(Gibco 11995) supplemented with 2% B27 (Gibco 17504),
1% N2 (Gibco 17502), 20 ng/ml recombinant human brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Peprotech), 20 ng/ml

insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (eBioscience), 40 ng/ml
tri-iodothyronine (T3), 40 ng/ml thyroxine (T4), 5 ng/ml NT3,
1% antibiotic/antimycotic, plus and minus recombinant hu-
man Gas6 ranging from 0.77Â­5.6 nM (55Â­400 ng/ml; Am-
gen). When co-cultures were maintained in PDGF-containing
medium, BDNF and IGF1 were not added. When PDGF was
removed from the medium, BDNF and IGF1 were added and
referred to as defined medium. Co-cultures were maintained
at 37C, 5% CO2
. The medium was changed three times/week
for 14 days whereupon co-cultures were fixed and analyzed
by immunofluorescent staining.
While maintaining the DRG explant cultures, the mixed
glial cultures and the DRG-enriched OPC co-cultures is chal-
lenging and time consuming, the culture conditions could be
optimized to obtain consistent results. On average each co-
culture experiment study took 7 weeks to complete, and an
additional 2Â­3 weeks to perform immunostaining and data
analysis. For our co-cultures, Matrigel was utilized as the
support matrix throughout all the studies.
Growing OPCs in culture
To determine the purity of the OPCs, enriched OPCs were
isolated from mixed glial culture (Jana et al., 2007) and
maintained in OPC medium [NB medium (Gibco 21103-
049), DMEM high-glucose (Gibco 11995-065), 1 mM pyru-
vate (Gibco 11360-070), 5 g/ml insulin (Sigma I6634),
10 g/ml biotin (Sigma B4639), 0.1% Cellgrow Trace Ele-
ments B (MT99-175-C10), 2% B27 (Gibco 17504-044), 2 mM
L-glutamine (Gibco 25030-081), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic
(Gibco 15240-096), 100 g/ml transferrin (Sigma T1147),
60 ng/ml progesterone (Sigma P8783), 100 g/ml BSA
(Sigma A4161), 16 g/ml putrescine (Sigma P7505), 40 ng/ml
sodium selenite (Sigma S5261), 40 ng/ml T3 (Sigma T6397),
40 ng/ml T4 (Sigma T1775)] at 37C, 5% CO2
, for 20 days, and
then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. By immunohistochem-
istry, OPCs were stained for the OL markers IV
-specific tubu-
lin and the transcription factor Olig1 (Figure 1). In addition,
O4 and PDGF-R were consistently positive (data not shown).

Recombinant human Gas6 (Amgen) grown in vitamin K-
containing medium was measured using the human Gas6
Quantikine ELISA kit (DGAS60, R&D Systems) following the
manufacturer's protocol.

polyclonal antibody (pAb) (1:5000; Millipore) was used to
identify axons. Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) anti-
body mAb 1567 was obtained from Millipore. Olig1 pAb was
a gift from Dr John Alberts, Dana Farber Institute. Olig2 pAb
(Dr John Alberts, and Millipore) were used to identify the per-
centage of Olig2+ oligodendrocytes that were MBP+ , and
in contact with axons. IV
tubulin (1:400; Sigma) was used to
identify OLs (Terada et al., 2005). Two PDGF-R pAbs, an anti-
rabbit obtained from Dr William Stallcup and an anti-goat
(R&D Systems), were used to demonstrate that the OPC cul-
tures were PDGF-R-positive (data not shown). Co-cultures
were incubated with antibodies against P0 (anti-chick, Mil-
lipore), and PMP22 (anti-rabbit, Sigma) to verify that the
co-cultures were free of Schwann cell contamination (data
not shown). P0 was generously provided by Dr James Salzer
(NYU, NY).
Antibodies evaluated for nodal and paranodal proteins
included (Caspr), obtained from Dr David Colman, neuro-
fascin antibody L11A/41.6 mAb, Kv1 channel, ankyrinG (neu-
romab@ucdavis.edu), and several neurofascin antibodies ob-
tained from Dr Barbara Zonta and Dr Peter Brophy (University
of Edinburgh). Co-cultures were fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde in PBS, washed three times in 1ÃTris-buffered saline,
pH 7.4 (1ÃTBS), methanol-fixed for 10 min at - 20C,
washed with 1ÃTBS, followed by a 1 h incubation in 2% goat
serum and 5% non-fat dried milk in 1ÃTBS + 0.1% Triton X-
100. All antibodies were diluted in 5% non-fat dried milk in
1ÃTBS + 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated overnight at 4C.
Cultures were washed three times in 1ÃTBS + 0.1% Triton
X-100 and incubated with AlexaFluor-conjugated, isotype-
specific secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature
(22C). Sections were visualized on an Olympus Digital Micro-
scope or a Zeiss Axioskop2 plus microscope with an AxioCam
MRC camera. Randomly selected fields were selected on the
MBP+ (green) channel, selecting MBP+ OLs with no knowl-
edge of association with the NF+ axon (red). For some stud-
ies, additional Z-series images were collected by confocal mi-
croscopy using the Lecia SP2-AOBS. To measure the length of
axonal ensheathment by MBP+ oligodendrocyte processes,
multiple Ã60 oil fields were photographed and the length
of the processes were calculated in ImageJ (NIH). Additional
measurements were obtained following determination of the
longest MBP+ process length using Volocity 3D image analy-
sis software. The software permits visualization of z-stacks as
interactive 3D images that improve the resolution of confocal
images. An in situ cell death detection kit fluorscein (Roche)
was used to analyze TUNEL+ cells/Ã60 fields in co-cultures
minus and plus Gas6 (n = 3). Briefly, random Ã60 fields from
three coverslips/condition were viewed on the NF+ chan-
nel to avoid biasing the TUNEL+ fields. Merged images were
analyzed for the mean number of condensed stained nuclei.
Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise noted, statistical analysis was evaluated in
GraphPad Prism using the unpaired t test. A MannÂ­Whitney
test was performed to evaluate the length of the longest
processes.
Electron microscopy (EM)
Co-cultures maintained for 14 days in defined medium mi-
nus and plus Gas6 were fixed with 2.0% paraformaldehyde,
2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4),
and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 1%
uranyl acetate, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol
and embedded in LX112 resin (LADD Research Industries). Ul-
trathin (80 nm) sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut UCT,
stained with 0.01% uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate
and viewed in a JEOL 1200EX or an Hitachi H600S instrument.
Toluidine blue-stained 1 m epoxy sections were examined
by light microscopy (Tsiperson et al., 2010). Co-cultures in
the absence of Gas6 were not processed further for EM as
the MBP+ immunofluorescent staining indicated that en-
sheathment was sparse, short or incomplete and, therefore,
requisite ensheathment necessary to observe wrapping and
myelin by EM would not be observed.
RESULTS
Establishment of DRG/OL co-cultures using
human fetal DRG explants and enriched OPCs
purified from mixed glial cultures
This is the first report of successfully maintaining human fe-
tal DRG in explant culture with long axons radiating from the
explant and reaching the edge of the coverslip. We have de-
termined that using growth-factor-reduced Matrigel stabi-
lized the axons better than fibronectin or poly-lysine alone or
in combination with Matrigel. Figure 1 shows a DRG explant
with parallel arrays of axons by phase microscopy (Figure 1A),
and axons following incubation with a chick NF polyclonal
antibody (Figure 1B). In our experience, a 3 week DRG explant
was optimal for use for co-culture resulting in axons that ex-
tended to the edge of the 12 mm coverslip. DRGs less than
15 gestational weeks could not support MBP+ OL expression
in co-culture and were not included in analyses. Optimal co-
cultures were obtained when the age of both the DRG and
the OPCs were >16 gestational weeks.
Using our current method to isolate enriched OPCs from
fetal brain, we examined whether addition of Gas6 (2.8 nM,
200 ng/ml) to IV
tubulin+ OPCs (n = 3 coverslips/treatment)
would enhance OPC maturation following 20 days in culture.
Fixed cultures were incubated with antibodies against IV
tubulin (green) and the transcription factor Olig1 (red), and
stained with Hoechst dye (blue). IV
tubulin+ specific OLs
with long bipolar and tripolar processes were observed in
all OPC cultures, with Olig1 in the nucleus. Post-mitotic OLs

Establishment of a human OPC/DRG co-culture
express Olig1 in the nucleus, and during myelination Olig1
is expressed in the cytosol (Arnett et al., 2004). As shown
in Figures 1(C) and 1(D), based on the IV
tubulin and Olig1
staining there was no dramatic morphologic changes in the
OPCs.
Characterization of human DRG/OPC co-cultures
supplemented with Gas6
Human OLs do not express mature myelin proteins in the
absence of axons. Therefore, we tested whether different
cocktails of growth factors and hormones in serum-free
medium support myelination in human OL/DRG co-cultures.
Since neurons synthesize and secrete Gas6, we measured the
amount of Gas6 secreted in the co-culture medium. After
feeding co-cultures in defined medium supplemented with
20 ng/ml IGF1 and BDNF for 3 days, the medium was ana-
lyzed for Gas6 using a human Gas6 ELISA kit. The amount
of Gas6 in the spent medium was 852 pg/ml or 12 pM.
Several sources of recombinant Gas6 are commercially avail-
able; however, we have only used recombinant human Gas6
obtained from Dr Brian Varnum at Amgen. This full-length
human Gas6 was grown in vitamin K-containing medium to
ensure -carboxylation of Gas6 required for activation and
phosphorylation of the TAM receptors. Using the ELISA assay
we determined that the Gas6 stock was stable over time and
equivalent to 1.86 mg/ml. In our co-cultures, we have exam-
ined a range of Gas6 concentrations from 0.35 nM to 5.6 nM
(25 ng/ml to 400 ng/ml). We determined that medium sup-
plemented with 0.77Â­5.6 nM Gas6 was beneficial for MBP+
process extension along the axon and enhancement of ax-
onal wrapping. We have determined that 0.35 nM Gas6 was
not effective, and concentrations greater than 2.8 nM were
similar to the 1.4 and 2.8 nM doses.
We evaluated human MBP+ OLs after 14 days in a differ-
entiating medium characterized for rat co-cultures (Chan et
al., 2004). Using that medium, as well as co-cultures main-
tained in medium with 10 ng/ml PDGF, we observed very few
MBP+ OLs relative to the total number of Olig2+ OPCs.
In PDGF-containing medium (n = 6 co-cultures), there were
24.2 +
- 5.7 MBP+ /Olig2+ oligodendrocytes per coverslip. In
co-cultures with 2.8Â­5.6 nM Gas6 (n = 4 co-cultures) there
was no significant increase in the number of MBP+ oligo-
dendrocytes and the total number of Olig2+ OPCs did not
increase; P > 0.05. The MBP+ OLs in co-culture plus or minus
Gas6 was <0.5% of the total OPCs plated. As shown in Fig-
ure 2(A), analysis of MBP+ OLs (green) determined that the
majority of the OLs maintained in PDGF medium had minimal
to no interaction with the axon. Figure 2(B) shows that while
the number of MBP+ OLs did not increase in the presence
of Gas6 there were more MBP+ OL processes in direct con-
tact with and parallel to axons (arrow) by immunofluorescent
staining and light microscopy. The mean length +
- S.E.M. of
the longest MBP+ linear segment was unchanged in the
absence (8.6 +
- 5.3 m) or presence (8.2 +
- 4.1 m) of Gas6,

indicating that in PDGF-containing media, Gas6 does not en-
hance MBP+ OL process outgrowth but does enhance MBP+
OL process association with the axon.
Gas6 increases the number of OL processes
ensheathing axons in co-culture maintained in
IGF1 + BDNF
Following addition of IGF1 + BDNF to our defined medium
the total number of MBP+ OLs/co-culture was significantly
increased compared with co-cultures maintained in PDGF-
containing medium. In the presence of IGF1 + BDNF the mean
number of MBP+ OLs/co-culture was 223.3 +
- 37.4 (n = 6
co-cultures). In IGF1+ BDNF+ medium supplemented with
0.77 nM Gas6 the mean number of MBP+ OLs/co-culture
was 209 +
- 50.1 (n = 6 co-cultures) with no significant dif-
ference in the overall number of MBP+ OLs (P > 0.05); the
addition of higher concentrations of Gas6 (2.8Â­5.6 nM) did
not increase the overall number of MBP+ OLs. Co-cultures
plus and minus Gas6 were stained for MBP, NF and TUNEL.

The mean number of TUNEL+ cells +

determined from three separate coverslips/condition. Quan-
tification determined that there were fewer TUNEL+ cells in
the Gas6-treated co-cultures (1.3 +
- 0.35/Ã60 field) relative
to the cells in defined medium only (5.1 +

Figures 2(C)Â­2(F) show representative images from multi-
ple co-cultures maintained in IGF + BDNF minus Gas6 (Fig-
ures 2C and 2E) and plus Gas6 (Figures 2D and 2F) with MBP+
OL processes wrapping axons (see arrows in Figures 2E and
2F). To test the prediction that Gas6 enhances MBP+ OL
process alignment and membrane ensheathment of axons,
co-cultures were treated with Gas6 for 14 days. The addition
of Gas6 led to a significant increase in the number of OL
processes ensheathing axons in several independent experi-
ments (P < 0.05). For each experiment, a minimum of three
coverslips/treatment were immunostained for MBP and NF
protein and 20 randomly selected MBP+ oligodendrocytes
were photographed by fluorescent microscopy (Ã60 oil). Us-
ing digital microscopy, one-dimensional analysis (length), and
Image J, the percentage of MBP+ processes (green) wrap-
ping NF+ axons (red) relative to the total number of MBP+
OLs/field was determined for each coverslip, and the mean
value was calculated/treatment. We determined that Gas6, at
0.77 nM and 2.8 nM, led to a significant increase in the num-
ber of OL processes ensheathing axons (P < 0.05). In the pres-
ence of Gas6 (n = 5 coverslips) there was a 6-fold increase
in the number MBP+ oligodendrocyte processes aligned and
wrapping axons relative to co-cultures maintained in the
absence of Gas6 (n = 4 coverslips). The histogram in Fig-
ure 3(A) shows that in the presence of Gas6 the percent-
age of wrapped axons in random fields was 50.5% while in
the absence of Gas6 the percentage of wrapped axons was
6.7%; P = 0.014. Although the overall percentages varied
from experiment to experiment, we consistently observed
significantly more wrapping in Gas6-containing co-cultures.

Establishment of a human OPC/DRG co-culture
In another experiment presented in Figure 3(B), we observed
73.3% of MBP+ oligodendrocytes ensheathed axons in cul-
tures maintained in 0.77 nM Gas6 relative to 38.9% MBP+
OLs ensheathing axons in medium minus Gas6; P = 0.0029.
There was no difference in the mean total number of MBP+
OLs in the co-cultures plus and minus Gas6, P > 0.05. In ad-
dition, using ImageJ we measured the length of the longest
MBP+ OL process completely wrapping the axon. Figure 3(C)
shows that the mean value of the longest MBP+ process
wrapping an axon in the Gas6-containing co-cultures was
24.7 m +
- 3.3 and the mean value for the co-cultures mi-
nus Gas6 was 11.9 m +
- 2.4; P = 0.007.
Having established that defined medium containing IGF1,
BDNF and Gas6 was optimal for OL processes ensheathing
axons we examined whether DRG explants isolated from the
cervical, thoracic and lumbar levels of the cord (17Â­19 gesta-
tional weeks) supported the differentiation of OPCs to MBP+
oligodendrocytes. Co-cultures consisting of a DRG explant
from each level of the cord and OPCs were analyzed for the
total number of MBP+ oligodendrocytes/co-culture. The to-
tal number of MBP+ oligodendrocytes/co-culture plus and
minus Gas6 was unchanged. The mean value was: cervical,
189 versus 153 MBP+ OLs/co-culture; thoracic, 297 versus
280 MBP+ OLs/co-culture; lumbar, 142 versus 115 MBP+
OLs/co-culture. Having demonstrated that DRGs from all lev-
els support OPC maturation, we repeated this study and ex-
amined whether Gas6 (0.77 nM) enhanced the percentage
of MBP+ OL processes that ensheath NF+ axons relative
to defined medium minus Gas6. We photographed MBP+
OLs aligned with NF+ axons, and calculated the percentage
of axonal processes ensheathed by MBP+ OL processes/40Ã
field. The number of MBP+ OL processes wrapping at least
one axon relative to the total number of MBP+ OL processes
parallel to the axon was determined for all images. The per-
centage of MBP+ OLs wrapping axons in Gas6-containing
medium relative to defined medium minus Gas6 was: cervi-
cal, 72% ( +
- 1.5; n = 2) versus 35% ( +
- 1.0; n = 2); thoracic,
72.5% ( +
- 8.5; n = 5) versus 24.6% ( +
- 11.3; n = 5; P = 0.01);
lumbar, 61% ( +
- 4.6; n = 3) versus 25% (+
- 7.1; n = 3; P =
0.013).
Human co-cultures express MAG and MBP, but
not P0
To examine the expression of additional mature myelin
proteins immunofluorescent staining on fixed co-cultures
was performed using antibodies against P0, a PNS-specific
marker, MAG, MBP, and NF. P0 expression was not detected
in any co-cultures examined. Figure 4 shows that MAG+ (red)
and MBP+ (green) OLs are expressed in IGF1+ BDNF+ co-
cultures. MAG+ MBP+ OLs with extensively branched pro-
cesses were observed both in the absence and presence of
Gas6 (n = 4 coverslips/condition; P > 0.05). In the presence
of Gas6, MAG+ processes (red, Figures 4G and 4J) and MBP+
processes (green, Figures 4H and 4K) wrapping NF+ axons
(blue) are observed. In Figures 4I and 4L (arrows), MAG+
OLs that express little MBP immunoreactivity and have no
processes wrapping axons are shown. OLs expressing MBP
have more myelin membrane sheets associated with axon
ensheathment (Figures 4HÂ­4N). We examined MAG+ MBP+
OLs by Z-series confocal microscopy and Volocity. All im-
ages were captured at the same laser intensity. Figure 4(M)
shows three strongly MAG+ OLs from a co-culture grown
in defined medium minus Gas6. The OL in the lower-left
corner is strongly MBP+ and maximal projection indicates
that the process is wrapping axons. Consistent with our data,
OLs grown in defined medium plus Gas6 have more exten-
sive wrapping. Figure 4(N) shows maximal projection of an
OL with multiple MBP+ processes wrapping multiple axons.
MAG expression appears to extend further to the periphery of
OL processes suggesting that MAG expression precedes MBP
in outer sheet formation of human fetal OLs (Figures 4M
and 4N). Co-cultures maintained in the absence or presence
of Gas6 had a similar percentage of OL processes with MAG
extending farther than MBP in OL processes along the axon,
56% versus 54% respectively (n = 4, P > 0.05). Consistent
with functional OLs, we found that a single OL could initiate
wrapping of a single axon at multiple sites. Also, MBP+ OLs
could wrap multiple axons.
To further explore if Gas6 consistently enhanced the
ensheathment of axons by MBP+ OL processes, we eval-
uated MBP+ processes aligned with the axon for ev-
idence of complete wrapping by Z-series confocal mi-
croscopy and 3D analysis. Figure 5(a) shows that in co-
culture maintained in the absence of Gas6, MBP+ OLs
processes were able to spirally wrap axons (arrow). Fig-
ure 5(b) shows an additional OL with MBP+ processes
ensheathing the axon (arrowhead) (Supplementary Movie
1 at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/006/an006e135add.htm).
Consistent with previous experiments, cultures minus Gas6
had fewer MBP+ OL processes wrapping axons, and the
length of the longest wrap of an OL process completely
around an axon was significantly shorter. Figure 5(c) shows
the Volocity projection of the longest process observed in
the co-culture in defined medium plus Gas6 (arrowhead)
(Supplementary Movie 2 at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/
006/an006e135add.htm).
We evaluated by immunofluoresecent staining and con-
focal microscopy whether the ensheathment of the axon
resulted in the expression of nodal or paranodal proteins
indicative of compact myelin from co-cultures maintained
for 14 days in 0.77 nM Gas6 (55 ng/ml) and 2.8 nM Gas6
(200 ng/ml). Co-cultures were incubated with antibodies
against NF, MBP and a nodal/paranodal protein including
caspr, ankyrinG, claudin11, NaV1.6
, and neurofascin 155 and
186 and examined by confocal microscopy. We did not find
localization of nodal or paranodal proteins immediately ad-
jacent to MBP+ OL processes ensheathing NF+ axons in
the vast majority of co-cultures examined. Based on these
finding we conclude that within our in vitro co-cultures,
Gas6 enhances axonal ensheathment and the formation of

fascin antibody (NeuromAb) showed nodal formation at a

Electron microscopic analysis confirms OL
processes in contact with and ensheathing axons
Immunofluoresecent staining and microscopy combined with
Volocity 3D software showed MBP+ processes wrap axons in
co-cultures. We examined OL process/axon interactions and
the extent of wrapping by electron microscopy. Figure 6
shows that multiple oligodendrocyte processes are in con-
tact with axons. In addition, axonalÂ­OL interactions suggest
that axonal ensheathment by OL processes requires a critical
axonal diameter. Axons (AX) shown in Figures 6A, 6(C), 6(D)
and 6(E) are  5 m in diameter. We did not observe con-
tacts between OLs and small diameter axons 1 m. As seen
in Figure 6(A), we observed numerous elongated OL mem-
branes forming contacts with an axon. The box is enlarged
to show multiple OLÂ­axon membrane contacts (Figure 6B).

observed. Figure 6(E) illustrates the axon in Figure 6(D) at
low magnification to indicate the OL processes in the upper-
left corner contacting the axon at three sites consistent with
our light microscopic data.
In addition to observing multiple OLÂ­axon membrane con-
tacts we observed OL processes wrapping the axon support-
ing our light microscopic data. The majority of the wraps
observed were one to two wraps of myelin membrane en-
sheathing the axon and with these co-cultures we did not
observe compact myelin. Figures 7(A)Â­7(D) shows represen-
tative axons wrapped in myelin membrane. Interestingly, we
observed in several grids with OL membrane wrapping and
multiple contacts/adhesions between the axonal membrane
and the OL membrane; see asterisk in Figure 7(B) and higher
magnifications of the contacts in Figures 7(F) and 7(G). Addi-
tionally, as observed in Figure 7(D), we observed an OL mem-
brane wrapping an axon, as well as contacting an additional
axonal membrane; higher magnification in Figure 7(H). These
data show that human fetal OL/DRG co-cultures generate
non-compact myelin that is able to contact, elongate, form
physical contacts, and ensheath axons. However, ultrastruc-
tural analysis failed to observe compact myelin in co-cultures
maintained in Gas6.
DISCUSSION
Myelination of axons is a highly regulated process relying
upon neuronal activity, adhesion, extracellular ligands, se-
creted molecules and receptor engagement on OLs and axons
(Emery, 2010; Piaton et al., 2010). With the exception of the
axonal initial segment, nodes and termini, the vast major-
ity of axons are ensheathed along their length to maximize
axonal conductance velocity. In the vertebrate CNS, myelin
is generated by elongated and flattened OL processes which
ensheath axons in multiple layers of lipid-rich plasma mem-
brane. Mature myelin is composed of both noncompact and
compact myelin consisting of lipids and several specialized
proteins synthesized by the OL. MBP, a 14Â­22.5 kDa protein,
is one of the most abundant proteins expressed in myelin.
MBP is highly charged and interacts with the cytoplasmic
side of the membrane serving as a molecular sieve to allow,
as well as restrict, select proteins to be incorporated into
the myelin sheath (Aggarwal et al., 2011). Based on the im-
portant role of MBP in myelination, we developed a human
co-culture model system to enable us to examine the effect
of Gas6 and other signaling molecules on MBP expression
and myelination.

Figure 6 Multiple OL/axonal contacts are observed in Gas6-treated co-cultures
A co-culture maintained for 14 days in defined medium plus Gas6 was embedded in Epon, and uranyl-stained and 1-m sections were
examined by EM. Examination of grids found fields containing axons with multiple oligodendrocytes. Scale bars in (AÂ­D) are 1 m; the
scale bar in (E) is 0.5 m.
We have determined that Gas6 enhanced ensheathment
of axons by MBP+ processes in human co-cultures. In earlier
studies using microarray analysis and RTÂ­PCR, we determined
that transcripts for PI3K, Axl and Mer were expressed at very
high levels in O4+ human OLs when myelination was ongoing
in fetal spinal cord. Our current data support these findings
and suggest a role for Gas6 signaling in ensheathment of the
axon by myelin membranes generating noncompact myelin.
Gas6 is detected in CSF (Sainaghi et al., 2008), and is ex-
pressed in and secreted by motor neurons and large neurons
of the DRG (Li et al., 1996; Allen et al., 1999). Gas6 and
its receptors are expressed widely in the CNS (Crosier and
Crosier, 1997; Avanzi et al., 1998; Allen et al., 1999; Prieto
et al., 2000). In situ hybridization studies performed in rat
CNS demonstrated that members of the TAM family are ex-
pressed on neurons and in white matter during myelination
(Allen et al., 1999; Prieto et al., 2000) supporting our finding
that Gas6/receptor interaction may enhance adhesion and
ensheathment between axons and OLs during myelination,
where high levels of both ligand and receptor are observed
(Prieto et al., 2000).
Gas6 activates Axl, Tyro3, and Mer receptor tyrosine ki-
nases in a concentration-dependent manner. While we have
no evidence that Axl is the receptor to which Gas6 is signaling
to in our co-culture model, Axl is preferentially activated by
Gas6 and is expressed during myelination (Prieto et al., 2000).
Also, Axl is required for Gas6-enhanced OL survival during tu-
mor ncerosis factor (TNF) challenge (Shankar et al., 2006). Axl
contains two binding sites for Gas6; Tyro3 and Mer each have
one binding site. In the developing CNS, Axl down-regulation
results in increased Tyro3 expression, but both continue to be
expressed in the mature CNS. Ligand/receptor engagement

results in kinase activation and autophosphorylation at three
tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain, and the re-
cruitment of signaling molecules such as Grb2 (pYXNX) and
PI3K (pYXXM) via the p85 subunit. Gas6 activation and re-
cruitment of Grb2 can activate MAPK and ERK (Fridell et al.,
1996). Whether the Grb2 binding domain and the PI3K do-
main can be engaged simultaneously or occurs sequentially is
yet to be determined. In survival studies we determined that

the p85 subunit of PI3K bound to the pYXXM site, and re-
cruited active PI3K (p85p110). Also, we determined that Akt
activation at the membrane occurred within 5 min of Gas6
treatment (Weinger et al., 2008). The ability of TAM recep-
tors to recruit Grb2 and signal to ERK kinase is intriguing as
ERK signaling has been implicated in axonal ensheathment
(Furusho et al., 2012). It is likely that there is redundancy in
the various growth factors and signaling molecules and sev-
eral may be required to achieve ensheathment and extensive
compact myelin formation in vitro and in vivo.
Gas6 was shown to enhance survival, and maturation of
PNS and CNS cells including neurons, OLs and Schwann cells
(Li et al., 1996; Shankar et al., 2003, 2006). In this study,
we have observed positive effects on myelination with Gas6
concentrations of 0.77Â­5.6 nM. By ELISA, we determined that
co-cultures maintained in the absence of Gas6 express  852
pg/ml Gas6 (12 pM) into the medium, although we cannot
directly equate this to the local Gas6 concentration imme-
diately following secretion by the neuron. Gas6 concentra-
tions in the CSF from patients with various diagnoses in-
cluding multiple sclerosis, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclero-
sis, headache, psychiatric conditions simulating neurological
diseases, otologic dizziness, GuillainÂ­BarrÂ´
e syndrome (GBS)
or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy were
5.6Â­11.5 ng/ml (Sainaghi et al., 2008, 2013).
For all our studies, we have only used recombinant hu-
man Gas6 that was grown in vitamin K-containing medium
and purified at Amgen. The resulting Gas6 is -carboxylated,
measurable in an ELISA assay, and is able to phosphorylate
Axl and Tyro3 (Brown et al., 2012). We have determined that
several of the commercially available recombinant Gas6 do
not contain the Gla domain, are not grown in the presence
of vitamin K, and are not tested for activity, only in a pro-
liferative response. Recombinant mouse Gas6 (R&D Systems)
has extremely low activity in in vitro kinase assays where
minimal Tyro3 was autophosphorylated (personal communi-
cation, A. Prieto). We do not know whether the Gla domain of
Gas6 is required for the ensheathment of axons by Gas6, and
we have not found any published studies that demonstrate
that Gas6 minus the Gla domain is active in vitro or in vivo.
We know that the Axl-Fc decoy is able to block the benefi-
cial effects of Amgen's Gas6 in primary OL cultures (Shankar
et al., 2006).
Factors differentially expressed by axons, OPCs, and myeli-
nating OLs rely on activation of promyelinating signaling
molecules as well as the suppression of extracellular in-
hibitory signals. We examined the ability of the human
DRGs and OPCs to support myelination at several gesta-
tional ages. OPCs isolated from brains at 14 gestational weeks
and younger never synthesized MBP+ OLs when co-cultured
with DRGs from early or late gestational ages. In two in-
dependent experiments, we determined that OPCs from 14
gestational weeks or younger did not mature to MBP+ OLs in
co-culture even when the co-cultured were maintained for
21 days. We determined that the DRG gestational week is less
critical than the OPC gestational age as 15 gestational week
DRGs could support myelination of 16 gestational week OPCs.
OPCs from 19 gestational weeks yield the highest number of
MBP+ OLs with some co-cultures containing as many as 470
MBP+ OLs/12 mm coverslip. However, the total percentage
of MBP+ OLs relative to the initial 100000 OPCs plated at
day 0 was less that 1%.
We determined that administration of Gas6 by mini-pump
directly to the corpus callosum enhanced re-myelination fol-
lowing cuprizone-induced demyelination (Tsiperson et al.,
2010). Additionally, Gas6-knockout mice had a delay in
remyelination during the recovery phase following cupri-
zone withdrawal suggesting that Gas6 promotes myelination
(Binder et al., 2011). Additional growth factors such as BDNF
enhance MBP+ expression (VonDran et al., 2010, 2011) in
murine oligodendrocytes and in rodent co-cultures (Prieto
et al., 1999, 2000; Cui et al., 2010). IGF1 increases myelin
in transgenic mice and myelination is altered in IGF1 null
mice (Carson et al., 1993; Ye et al., 2002). We determined
that BDNF, IGF and Gas6 enhanced ensheathment of axons
in human co-culture, and EM confirmed our immunoflores-
cent staining and confocal microscopy findings. Our studies
demonstrated that multiple OLs can contact a single axon,
and multiple MBP+ processes from single OLs can ensheath
a single axon, or multiple axons. The nature of the proteins
contained at the "adhesion contact" observed between the
OL membrane and the axon by EM requires further analysis.
A recent paper suggest that both the adhesive properties of
proteolipid protein and the loss of sialic acid residues from
the cell surface during myelinogenesis aid in myelin mem-
brane adhesion and the compaction of CNS myelin (Bakhti
et al., 2013).
Finally, we examined by EM whether there is a pref-
erential axonal diameter for initial myelination in our hu-
man co-cultures. We determined that the majority of myeli-
nated axons had a mean axon diameter of 5 m. It is
possible that the limited number of axonal wraps observed
in our co-cultures is the result of variability in the diam-
eter of the axons. Small axons tend not be myelinated,
and larger or swollen axons are more difficult to myeli-
nate. We determined that aged DRG explants maintained
for longer than 4 weeks did not efficiently support myelina-
tion when plated with OPCs in co-culture. Additionally, 1%
paraformaldehyde-fixed axons did not support human OPC
formation of MBP+ myelin membranes. While our studies
show that Gas6 supports wrapping of noncompact myelin
membranes in a human co-culture system, many aspects of
myelin biology are still unresolved. Future studies will ex-
plore additional pathways to determine whether activators
and inhibitors affect wrapping, and whether Gas6 can syner-
gize with signal transduction pathways to enhance compact
myelin formation. Thus, for successful myelination to occur,
intrinsic and extrinsic factors must be co-ordinately regu-
lated both at the axon and at the OL. The co-ordinated inte-
gration of multiple intrinsic signaling pathways determines
when differentiation and maturation in the human CNS oc-
curs. Our methodological analyses for the establishment of

Establishment of a human OPC/DRG co-culture
human DRG/OL co-cultures provide a foundation for future
in vitro studies of human myelination. Furthermore, our data
demonstrate that IGF1 and BDNF enhance the expression
of mature myelin proteins, including MAG and MBP, and
supplementation with Gas6 results in OL processes extend-
ing myelin membranes that augment axonal ensheathment.
Growth factors including insulin, BDNF, IGF1, thyroid hor-
mone and Gas6 are among the ligands that, through receptor
engagement and downstream signaling by multiple kinases,
regulate OL differentiation and myelination. Clearly, the com-
plex interactions necessary to obtain axonal ensheathment,
noncompact myelin, and compact myelin formation will re-
quire cross-talk and integration of multiple signaling path-
ways. The MAPK/ERK, the cAMP pathway, PI3K/Akt and mam-
malian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways have
all been implicated in myelination (Hannila and Filbin, 2008;
Nave, 2010; Wood et al., 2013)
