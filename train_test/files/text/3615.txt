Abstract
Objective: The disappearance of a loved one is claimed to be the most stressful type of loss. The present review explores the
empirical evidence relating to this claim. Specifically, it summarizes studies exploring the prevalence and correlates of psycho-
logical symptoms in relatives of missing persons as well as studies comparing levels of psychopathology in relatives of the dis-
appeared and the deceased. Method: Two independent reviewers performed a systematic search in PsychINFO, Web of Science,
and Medline, which resulted in 15 studies meeting predefined inclusion criteria. Eligible studies included quantitative peer-
reviewed articles and dissertations that assessed psychopathology in relatives of missing person. Results: All reviewed studies
were focused on disappearances due to war or state terrorism. Prevalence rates of psychopathology were mainly described in
terms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and varied considerably among the studies. Number of experienced
traumatic events and kinship to the missing person were identified as correlates of psychopathology. Comparative studies showed
that psychopathology levels did not differ between relatives of missing and deceased persons. Conclusions: The small number of
studies and the heterogeneity of the studies limit the understanding of psychopathology in those left behind. More knowledge
about psychopathology postdisappearance could be gained by expanding the focus of research beyond disappearances due to war
or state terrorism.

Systematic reviews have shown that the death of a significant
other can lead to serious mental health issues including depres-
sion, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and complicated
grief1 (Kristensen, Weisæth, & Heir, 2012; Lobb et al., 2010;
van Denderen, de Keijser, Kleen, & Boelen, 2015). One of the
risk factors for developing psychological symptoms following
the loss of a significant other is the type of loss (Kristensen
et al., 2012; van Denderen et al., 2015). Unnatural, sudden, and
violent losses, such as homicide and suicide, are associated
with increased risk of psychopathology (Boelen, de Keijser,
& Smid, 2015; Currier, Holland, & Neimeyer, 2006).
A unique type of loss is the disappearance of a loved one,
also referred to as an "ambiguous loss"2 or "unconfirmed loss"
(Boss, 1976; Powell, Butollo, & Hagl, 2010). Disappearances
of persons affect thousands of people around the world yearly,
especially in the context of war and/or state terrorism3 (i.e., acts
of cruelty conducted by a state against its own people; Aust,
2010, p. 265). A frequently cited assumption (e.g., Betz &
Thorngren, 2006; Heeke & Knaevelsrud, 2015) originating
from family stress theories (Betz & Thorngren, 2006) and
family systems theories (Carroll, Olson, & Buckmiller, 2007)
is that "Ambiguous loss is the most stressful loss because it
defies resolution and creates confused perceptions about who is
in or out of a particular family" (Boss, 2004, p. 553).
Recently, Heeke and Knaevelsrud (2015) presented a brief
overview of seven quantitative studies focusing on psycho-
pathology after the disappearance of a loved one due to war
and state terrorism. They concluded that (a) PTSD, depression,

and complicated grief symptoms are common following the
disappearance of a loved one, and (b) these symptoms are more
severe compared to symptoms observed in people confronted
with the death of a loved one. However, there are some limita-
tions that preclude firm conclusions. From a methodological per-
spective, the review may not give a complete and valid overview
of the existing literature because it lacked a systematic approach
(e.g., no systematic search strategy, specifics about study selec-
tion criteria, and quality assessment of the reviewed studies).
Furthermore, the evidence does not unequivocally support Heeke
and Knaevelsrud's (2015) conclusions. For instance, indices of
psychopathology were only significantly higher among relatives
of missing persons compared to relatives of deceased persons in
three of the five comparative studies (Powell et al., 2010; Quirk &
Casco, 1994; Zvizdic & Butollo, 2001). Moreover, in these three
studies, some but not all indices of psychopathology differed
significantly. All in all, Boss's (1976, 2004) claim that the dis-
appearance of a loved one is the most stressful type of loss does
not seem to rest on a solid empirical basis.
The current review provides a systematic overview of the
scientific research on psychological symptoms in people con-
fronted with the disappearance of a loved one. Our review
complements Heeke and Knaevelsrud's (2015) review in that
we used a systematic approach, in order to prevent selection
bias of the reviewed studies and to guarantee replicability.
Given the large number of people who are confronted with a
disappearance due to war and state terrorism, it is important to
give a systematic overview of current state of the literature
regarding psychological symptoms in relatives of missing per-
sons. This may contribute, among others, to (1) knowledge
about the nature and severity of psychopathology in relatives
of missing persons, (2) the identification of risk factors for
psychopathology, and (3) directions for future research. In the
following, we address three objectives. First, we aimed to sum-
marize the studies examining prevalence rates of psychological
symptoms in relatives of missing persons. Second, we sought to
describe correlates of psychological symptoms. Our third goal
was to enumerate the results of studies exploring differences in
severity of psychopathology among relatives of disappeared
people compared to relatives of deceased people.
Method
Inclusion Criteria
Quantitative studies published in peer-reviewed academic jour-
nals and dissertations of which the abstract is indexed in scien-
tific literature databases were included. The studies needed to
report about psychological symptoms in spouses, family mem-
bers, and/or friends of missing persons. A missing person is
defined as: "Anyone whose whereabouts is unknown whatever
the circumstances of disappearance. They will be considered
missing until located and their well-being or otherwise establish-
ed" (Association of Chief Police Officers, 2010, p. 15).
An article was excluded if it (1) was a qualitative or case
study, (2) did not include data of participants (e.g., a literature
overview), (3) was focused on participants of whom a relative
had returned after a period of disappearance, (4) was focused
on ambiguous loss in terms of being physically present but
psychologically absent (e.g., dementia patients; cf. Boss,
1976), or (5) concerned relatives of persons whose loved one
was absent but not missing (e.g., foster care). A protocol of the
review can be obtained in the PROSPERO register (Lenferink,
de Keijser, Boelen, & Wessel, 2015). The preferred reporting
items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines were followed (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman,
& PRISMA Group, 2009).
Search Strategy
Three topics structured the search terms: (1) missing persons,
(2) people who are left behind, and (3) psychological symp-
toms. Because of the different words that can be used for each
of the three search topics, we entered multiple search terms (at
least 12 per topic) to be as complete as possible (see Appendix
Figure A1 for the search terms). Three electronic literature
databases (PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Medline) were
searched in June 2015. No date or language restrictions were
applied in the search strategy.
Study Selection
The consecutive steps for the selection of studies that were
performed independently by two reviewers are displayed in
Figure 1. In sum, the search terms in three databases resulted
in 770 hits. After removal of duplicates, the remaining articles
were screened first by title, second by abstract, and lastly by
full text based upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Finally, the raters screened the reference lists of the eligible
studies (n ¼ 17) for additional studies meeting the inclusion
criteria. As for interrater reliability, the percentages of absolute
agreement between the raters ranged from 81% to 92%. In case
of disagreement, consensus was reached through discussion.
The databases were again searched in March 2016 for recently
added literature, which resulted in zero eligible studies.
Two dissertations (Boss, 1976; Munczek, 1996) initially
deemed eligible for inclusion were eventually excluded from the
current review because reading the full text revealed that they
provided the basis for published articles that were already
included (Boss, 1977; Munczek & Tuber, 1998). Likewise, one
study (Hagl, Rosner, Butollo, & Powell, 2014) was excluded
because it appeared to be a clinical trial of which the relevant
data were reported in another study (Powell et al., 2010) that was
already included in the review. In addition, a language barrier
necessitated discarding a study published in Croatian after
including it based upon the abstract (Bek, Buzov, & Bilic
´, 2001).
Synthesis of Results
First, current and/or lifetime prevalence rates of psychopathol-
ogy in relatives of missing persons are described for each study.
The prevalence rates reflect the percentages of participants
2 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE XX(X)
scoring beyond the established clinical threshold of the specific
measure used. Second, results of correlation analyses or regres-
sion analyses, t test, w2 test, and/or F test, to assess correlates of
psychological symptoms are summarized. Third, Cohen's d
effect sizes were computed for the studies that compared the
severity of psychological symptoms between relatives of miss-
ing persons and relatives of deceased persons. According
to Cohen's (1988) effect sizes, d ¼ 0.2 to 0.5 are small,
d ¼ 0.5 to 0.8 medium, and d ¼ !0.8 large.
Quality Assessment of the Included Studies
Performing a quality assessment of observational studies in
systematic reviews is one of the criteria in the PRISMA guide-
lines for reporting systematic reviews (Moher et al., 2009). We
assessed the quality of the included studies using the systematic
assessment of quality in observational research (SAQOR; Ross
et al., 2011), a checklist that is developed for (Ross et al., 2011)
and previously used in quality assessment of psychiatric obser-
vational studies (e.g., Kohrt et al., 2014). The SAQOR evalu-
ates the quality of studies based on meeting criteria in six
domains: (i) sample, (ii) control/comparison group, (iii) quality
of exposure/outcome measurements, (iv) follow-up, (v) distort-
ing influences, and (vi) reporting data. Each domain consists of
multiple criteria. The domain is rated as "adequate,"
"inadequate," "unclear," or "not applicable" based on the fre-
quency of fulfilled criteria of the subsequent domain. An over-
all quality rating--high, moderate, low, or very low--of each
study is then determined based on frequency of adequate
domains. As recommended by the authors of the tool (Ross
et al., 2011) and consistent with authors using it (e.g., Kohrt
et al., 2014), we slightly adapted the SAQOR to fit our specific
population (see Appendix Table B1 for more details).

2014; Campbell & Demi, 2000; Navia & Ossa, 2003; Powell

(Basharat, Zubair, & Mujeeb, 2014; Munczek & Tuber,
1998), and four studies for very low quality (Boss, 1977,
1980; Clark, 2001; Quirk & Casco, 1994; see Appendix

15 studies). The four very low-quality studies are not addressed

Characteristics of the Included Studies
All 11 low to high quality studies used a cross-sectional design.
The sample sizes varied from 14 to 225 relatives of missing
persons. Two studies (Barakovic
´ et al., 2013, 2014) relied on a
sample of women (n ¼ 120) whose male family member dis-
appeared during the war in Bosnia Herzegovina 15­18 years
earlier. Another sample included women from Bosnia Herze-
govina (n ¼ 56), whose husbands disappeared during the war
on average 7 years earlier (Powell et al., 2010). A fourth study
included a sample of adolescents (n ¼ 201) whose fathers had
been missing since 3­4 years in the context of war in Bosnia
Herzegovina (Zvizdic & Butollo, 2001). Two studies were
conducted in the United States among a small sample of family
members of men listed as missing in action (MIA; Campbell &
Demi, 2000; n ¼ 20) or prisoner of war (POW; Reisman, 2003;
n ¼ 14) for over 25 years ago. Two studies were executed
among relatives of disappeared persons in Colombia; one due
to state terrorism 13 years earlier (n ¼ 73; Heeke et al., 2015)
and another due to economic extortive kidnapping (n ¼ 46;
Navia & Ossa, 2003). Navia and Ossa (2003) did not provide
information on the amount of time that had passed since the
disappearance. In Chile, Pe
´rez-Sales, Dura
´n-Pe
´rez, and Herz-
feld (2000) studied people (n ¼ 75) whose relative disappeared
due to state terrorism more than 20 years earlier. Children (n ¼
16) whose fathers disappeared 9 years ago, on average, due to
state terrorism were the subjects of a study in Honduras (Munc-
zek & Tuber, 1998). The last study was focused on Pakistani
family members (n ¼ 225) who lived for 1­9 years with the
disappearance of a loved one due to state terrorism (Basharat
et al., 2014).
Prevalence of Psychological Symptoms (Objective 1)
In four unique samples, described in five articles, prevalence
rates of psychological symptoms were reported (Barakovic
´
et al., 2013, 2014; Heeke et al., 2015; Navia & Ossa, 2003;
Pe
´rez-Sales et al., 2000). Due to the heterogeneity of the
studies (e.g., studies varied in terms of instruments used to
assess symptoms and in terms of ethnic background of
study samples), the prevalence rates of psychological
symptoms are reported separately for each study (see Table 1
for a summary of the characteristics and the main findings
of the studies).
The two studies of Barakocic et al. (2013, 2014) relied on
the same sample and showed current self-rated prevalence
rates of 88% for depression, 65% for mild to severe anxiety
complaints, 56% for PTSD, and 43% for somatic complaints.
Heeke et al.'s (2015) study showed that 69% reported current
depression, 67% PTSD, and 23% complicated grief based on
interviews. Interview-based current prevalence rate of PTSD
was 39% in a study of Navia and Ossa (2003). A final study
reported considerably lower interview-based current and life-
time prevalence rates of PTSD (1%/3%), depression (3%/
17%), anxiety (1%/5%), and complicated grief (7%/27%;
Pe
´rez-Sales et al., 2000).
Correlates of Psychological Symptoms Among Relatives
of the Disappeared (Objective 2)
Gender. Three studies examined whether psychopathology lev-
els varied as a function of gender (Basharat et al., 2014; Camp-
bell & Demi, 2000; Heeke et al., 2015). To begin with,
Basharat et al. (2014) found that females were significantly
more stressed (d ¼ 0.41), depressed (d ¼ 0.52), and anxious
(d ¼ 0.38) than males. A second study reported that gender was
not significantly associated with complicated grief severity
(Heeke et al., 2015). A third study reported that gender was
unrelated to severity of complicated grief and PTSD (Campbell
& Demi, 2000).
Age. Three studies explored the association between age and
psychological symptoms (Basharat et al., 2014; Campbell &
Demi, 2000; Heeke et al., 2015). The first showed that older
participants were significantly more generally distressed than
younger participants (Basharat et al., 2014). Two further
studies reported nonsignificant associations between age and
psychopathology in terms of complicated grief and PTSD
(Campbell & Demi, 2000; Heeke et al., 2015).
Kinship. In two samples, the difference in severity of psycho-
pathology according to type of kinship was examined
(Barakovic
´ et al., 2013, 2014; Basharat et al., 2014). Women
with a missing son experienced significantly higher levels of
PTSD, depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms compared to
women with a missing husband, brother, or father (Barakovic
´
et al., 2013, 2014). Basharat et al.'s (2014) study showed that
spouses were significantly more distressed than parents and
siblings. In addition, parents were significantly more dis-
tressed than siblings.
Time since disappearance. The association between time since
disappearance and psychopathology was studied twice
(Basharat et al., 2014; Heeke et al., 2015). Basharat et al.
(2014) showed that participants whose loved one disappeared
1­3 years earlier reported significantly higher levels of
general distress than those whose loved one disappeared
3­9 years ago. However, in the same study, participants
whose loved one disappeared 6­9 years ago experienced sig-
nificantly higher levels of general distress than participants
whose loved one disappeared 3­6 years ago. Heeke et al.'s
(2015) study reported a negative correlation (r ¼ À.31,
p < .01) between time since disappearance (in months) and
complicated grief severity, but time since disappearance was
not a significant predictor of complicated grief after control-
ling for other variables (e.g., depression).
Educational level. The association between educational level and
psychopathology was only examined by Heeke et al. (2015).
They found education (in terms of number of years of
education) to be unrelated to complicated grief.

Number of experienced traumatic events. Four studies assessed
the number of traumatic events the relatives of missing persons
had been exposed to (Barakovic
´ et al., 2014; Heeke et al., 2015;
Powell et al., 2010; Zvizdic & Butollo, 2001). Barakovic
´ et al.
(2014) found an increase in the number of experienced trau-
matic events to be associated with increased levels of depres-
sion (r ¼ .61, p < .001), PTSD (r ¼ .58, p < .001), and anxiety
(r ¼ .44, p < .001). Zvizdic and Butollo (2001) found that more
exposure to several war-related events (e.g., loss of home) and
postwar-related events (e.g., family problems) were both also
associated with depression (r ¼ .26, p < .01 and r ¼ .26,
p < .01). A third study performed 11 regression analyses with
type of loss (disappearance vs. death), number of prewar, war-
time, and postwar stressors as predictors and several psycholo-
gical symptoms as outcome variables. Number of postwar but
not prewar or wartime stressors were associated with one of the
complicated grief subscales (defined as traumatic grief;
t ¼ 3.03, p < .01) and depression (t ¼ 2.37, p < .01) next to
type of loss (Powell et al., 2010). Finally, Heeke et al.'s (2015)
study showed that an increase in the number of experienced
traumatic events was associated with complicated grief
(r ¼ .30, p < .01); this association disappeared, however, when
gender, severity of PTSD, and depression were partialled out.
Family functioning. Two studies examined the association
between perceived functioning of the family and psychopathol-
ogy (Campbell & Demi, 2000; Navia & Ossa, 2003). Navia and
Ossa (2003) found no significant associations between five
family coping strategies (e.g., seeking spiritual support and
passive appraisal) and PTSD and general psychological distress
in a subgroup (n ¼ 18) of their sample. This subgroup included
one family member per missing person in order to handle the
within-family clustering effect. In addition, within the same
subgroup of their sample, a significant association was found
between general psychological distress and aspects of family
functioning (i.e., family roles, r ¼ .52, p < .05, i.e., the way in
which family members allocate responsibilities; behavior con-
trol, r ¼ .52, p < .05, i.e., the way in which families provide
clear standards and rules of behavior; and general family func-
tioning, r ¼ .50, p < .05). A higher score on family functioning
was indicative of unhealthier family functioning. No signifi-
cant association was found between PTSD and family function-
ing. Campbell and Demi (2000) reported that individuals
experienced less PTSD symptoms of the avoidance cluster,
when they felt their family was cooperative in solving prob-
lems (r ¼ À.47, p < .05) and is in control over dealing with
adverse life events (r ¼ À.49, p < .05). Furthermore, individ-
uals reported less complicated grief when they viewed their
families as active in managing challenging situations
(r ¼ À.50, p < .05) and in control over dealing with these
situations (r ¼ À.62, p < .05).
Coping strategies. The association between use of coping strate-
gies and psychopathology was examined in only one study
(Basharat et al., 2014). That study showed that greater use of
emotion-focused coping strategies (e.g., seeking sympathy from
others) was associated with increased levels of depression
(r ¼ .38, p < .001), anxiety (r ¼ .24, p < .001), and stress
(r ¼ .41, p < .001). Greater use of problem-focused coping stra-
tegies (e.g., thinking about dealing with the problem) was asso-
ciated with decreased levels of depression (r ¼ À.48, p < .001),
anxiety (r ¼ À.35, p < .001), and stress (r ¼ À.26, p < .01).
Extent of hope that the missing person is alive. The association
between extent of hope that the loved one is still alive and
psychopathology was explored in one study. Extent of hope
explained 5% of the variance in complicated grief above gender,
depression and PTSD severity, number of experienced traumatic
events, and time since disappearance (Heeke et al., 2015).
Summary of the results of correlational studies. No clear conclu-
sions can be drawn about the association between psychopathol-
ogy and gender or age. The results with respect to the association
between kinship and psychopathology were consistent across
two samples. More specifically, spouses and parents of missing
persons seem to be the most affected compared to siblings.
Based on one study, years of education were unrelated to com-
plicated grief. The two studies that explored the association
between time since disappearance and symptom severity yielded
contrasting results. The results of four studies indicated that
number of traumatic events that people had been exposed to was
significantly associated with increased levels of psychopathol-
ogy. Two studies assessed the association between family func-
tioning and psychological symptoms and found inconsistent
results. Using emotion-focused coping strategies, more fre-
quently and problem-focused less frequently coping strategies
were related to higher psychopathology levels based on a single
study. One study showed a positive association between extent
of hope that the loved one is still alive and psychopathology.
Disappearance Versus Death (Objective 3)
Six studies, all cross-sectional studies, compared relatives of
disappeared to deceased persons, all in the context of state
terrorism or war. Homicide was the cause of death in all cases,
with an exception of the study of Heeke et al. (2015) of which
93% of the deceased persons were victims of homicide and the
other 7% died due to another reason related to state terrorism
(e.g., illness). A summary of the studies is offered in Table 2.
PTSD. In four studies, the severity or prevalence of PTSD symp-
toms did not differ significantly between relatives of victims of
disappearance to relatives of homicide victims (Heeke et al.,
2015; Munczek & Tuber, 1998; Powell et al., 2010; Reisman,
2003). A fifth study showed that lifetime prevalence rate of PTSD
sincethelosswassignificantlyhigheramonghomicidallybereaved
individuals (9.0%) than individuals confronted with the disappear-
ance of a family member (1.3%; Pe
´rez-Sales et al., 2000).
Depression. One study showed that spouses of men who disap-
peared had significantly more severe depressive symptoms
than homicidally bereaved spouses (Powell et al., 2010). This
8 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE XX(X)
difference had a medium effect size (d ¼ 0.67). Another study
reported that those for whom a loved one disappeared also
experienced significantly higher depression levels than homi-
cidally bereaved individuals (d ¼ 0.22; Zvizdic & Butollo,
2001). Three other studies did not find significant differences
in severity or prevalence of depression between relatives of
victims of disappearance or homicide (Heeke et al., 2015;
Munczek & Tuber, 1998; Pe
´rez-Sales et al., 2000).
Anxiety. Anxiety symptom severity did not differ significantly
between children and spouses of men who were victims of
disappearance or homicide (Munczek & Tuber, 1998; Powell
et al., 2010). Lifetime prevalence rates of anxiety disorders
since the loss was significantly higher for the relatives of the
disappeared (5.3%) compared to the homicidally bereaved
(0.0%; Pe
´rez-Sales et al., 2000).
Complicated grief. Women whose husbands disappeared reported
significantly higher levels of "traumatic grief" compared to homi-
cidally bereaved women (Powell et al., 2010). This difference can
be interpreted as a medium effect (d ¼ .79). Within the same
study, no significant differences were found between groups in
termsof"existentialgrief"(Powelletal.,2010).Itremainsunclear
in this article how traumatic and existential grief were defined and
how they differed from each other. A second study also failed to
show significant differences in severity or prevalence of compli-
cated grief between relatives of the disappeared compared to
homicidally bereaved family relatives (Heeke et al., 2015).
Pe
´rez-Sales et al. (2000) reported nonsignificant differences in
prevalence rates of complicated grief between family members
of persons who disappeared or were victims of homicide.
Social dysfunction and somatic symptoms. One study examined the
differences in severity of social dysfunction and somatic symp-
toms between wives whose husbands disappeared or were vic-
tims of homicide. No significant differences were shown for
the two groups (Powell et al., 2010).

terrorism, indicated that relatives of disappeared persons and
relatives of homicide victims overall did not significantly differ
in severity or prevalence rate of psychopathology. Only 4 of the
24 comparisons across six studies yielded significantly higher
levels of severity or prevalence of psychological symptoms in
the disappeared group compared to the homicide group, and
these differences had a small to medium effect size (see Table 2).
Discussion
The present study reviewed research relevant to Boss's (2004)
frequently cited claim that the disappearance of a loved one is
more traumatic than other types of loss. The first aim was sum-
marizing the results regarding prevalence rates of psychological
symptoms in relatives of missing persons. Prevalence rates of
psychopathology were mainly described in terms of PTSD and
depression and varied widely across a small number of studies
(i.e., 1­67% for PTSD, 3­88% for depression, 1­65% for anxi-
ety, 7­23% for complicated grief, and 43% for somatic com-
plaints). Several things stand out from this summary of
prevalence rates. Only 5 of the 11 studies assessed prevalence
rates of psychological symptoms. Furthermore, these five studies
varied in (a) instruments used to assess psychopathology (e.g.,
none of the studies used the same instrument), (b) ethnic back-
ground of study samples, (c) composition of study samples (e.g.,
female family members or children of missing persons and rela-
tives of missing persons due to war vs. due to state terrorism),
and (d) methodological quality. Therefore, no general conclusive
statements can be made about which psychological symptoms
are most common among relatives of missing persons.
The second aim was exploring correlates of psychological
symptoms in relatives of missing persons. Compared to other
background characteristics, the type of kinship as correlate of
psychopathology yielded the most consistent results. Spouses and
parents ofmissingpersons seem tobe the most affected compared
to siblings. However, only two studies explored the association
between type of kinship and psychopathology. The association
between other demographic variables--gender, age, educational
level, and time since disappearance--and psychopathology was
conflicting. The results of these correlational studies are roughly
in accord with earlier studies among bereaved individuals.
Reviews (Kristensen et al., 2012; Lobb et al., 2010; Stroebe &
Schut, 2001) ongrief-relateddistressindicatethatthe relationship
between gender, educational level, age, and time since loss on the
one hand and psychopathology on the other hand is conflicting.
The relationship between kinship to the deceased and psycho-
pathology is more consistent and indicates that parents and
spouses are most strongly affected by a loss.
It should be noted that our systematic review does not war-
rant drawing firm conclusions about the association between
background characteristics and psychopathology because,
taken together, the evidence is not sufficient. The composition
of the majority of the study samples precluded the examination
of the association between some of the background character-
istics and psychopathology. For example, some samples con-
sisted of solely females, which precluded studying the
association between psychopathology and gender (Barakovic
´
et al., 2013, 2014; Powell et al., 2010). Others only included
one type of kinship (e.g., children of missing persons) and
therefore did not allow to study the potential differences in
severity of psychopathology across different familial relation-
ships (Campbell & Demi, 2000; Munczek & Tuber 1998;
Powell et al., 2010; Reisman, 2003; Zvidic & Butollo, 2001).
Furthermore, four studies (Barakovic
´ et al., 2014; Heeke
et al., 2015; Powell et al., 2010; Zvizdic & Butollo, 2001)
yielded evidence that the number of traumatic events partici-
pants had experienced is associated with increased levels of
psychological symptoms. This is in line with previous trauma
research indicating that cumulative trauma heightens the risk of
development of PTSD (e.g., Johnson & Thompson, 2008;
Kolassa et al., 2010; Wilker et al., 2015). More specifically,
several studies showed that being exposed to traumatic events
and the loss of a loved one heightens the risk of development of
complex psychopathological symptom patterns characterized by
comorbid symptoms of complicated grief, PTSD, and depression
(cf. Mutabaruka, Se
´journe
´, Bui, Birmes, & Chabrol, 2012; Nick-
erson et al., 2014). Relatives of missing persons with comorbid
symptoms may benefit most from interventions targeting differ-
ent types of symptoms, such as brief eclectic psychotherapy and
cognitive behavioral therapy (cf. Smid et al., 2015).
It has been postulated that holding on to hope for the return
of the missing loved one may be associated with less emotional
distress (Wayland, Maple, McKay, & Glassock, 2016). How-
ever, inconsistent with this notion, the single empirical study
(Heeke et al., 2015) examining this linkage actually showed
that the extent of hope that the loved one was still alive was
associated with higher levels of complicated grief. The present
review revealed mixed results regarding the use of coping stra-
tegies and family functioning as correlates of psychopathology.
No further conclusions can be drawn about to what extent
psychopathology is related to these constructs, since these
potential associations were only explored in three studies,
which yielded inconclusive results and differed from each other
in many ways (e.g., sample composition and measures used).
The third aim of the present systematic review was explor-
ing whether the disappearance of a loved one is associated with
more severe distress compared to the death of loved one (Boss,
2004). The claim that people who experience an ambiguous
loss suffer from more severe psychological symptoms than
individuals who experience another type of loss does not seem
to be supported by the comparative studies reviewed here. Only
4 of in total 24 comparisons across six comparative studies
revealed that relatives of missing persons suffered from signif-
icantly more severe psychological symptoms compared to
homicidally bereaved individuals. This is in contrast with the
conclusion drawn in Heeke and Knaevelsrud's (2015) over-
view. Although there is overlap in the reviewed studies of the
overview of Heeke and Knaevelsrud (2015) and our review,
incompleteness of this former overview and different weighing
of the empirical evidence may explain the difference in con-
clusion drawn. For instance, Heeke and Knaevelsrud (2015)
omitted some comparative studies in their review (e.g.,
10 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE XX(X)
Munczek & Tuber, 1998). In addition, they elaborated on sig-
nificant findings of a study of Quirk and Casco (1994) that we
rated as very low quality and was therefore not discussed.
It is possible that methodological drawbacks of the reviewed
studies are responsible for the lack of differences in psycho-
pathology between relatives of the disappeared and the
deceased. One of the major methodological shortcomings was
the small sample size of the studies, increasing the risk of Type
II error. Furthermore, all comparative studies were conducted
in the context of war or state terrorism. Both groups were
traumatized by different stressors, which might have made it
difficult to distinguish between the effect of the loss of a loved
one and the effects of other traumatic experiences. Lastly, we
believe it is important to emphasize that studies conducted in
the context of war-related disappearances may not be compa-
rable to disappearances in the context of state terrorism. Our
conclusion therefore needs to be interpreted with caution.
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
providing a systematic review of empirical findings about the
nature and severity of psychological symptoms in relatives of
the disappeared. However, this present review has primarily
revealed gaps in the literature on psychological symptoms in
relatives of missing persons. The field of psychological
research in relatives of missing persons could benefit from at
least two types of improvements: (1) expanding the focus of
research to comparing relatives of missing persons in the context
of war and state terrorism as well as focusing on relatives of
missing persons outside the context of war and state terrorism
and (2) employing more rigorous research methods.
Expanding the Focus of Research
The results of our systematic review indicate that with no
exception, the existing literature is focused on disappearances
in the context of armed conflict (e.g., war or state terrorism). It
would be interesting to study to what extent the experience of
the disappearance of a loved one due to war differs from the
disappearance due to state terrorism. Losing a significant other
in war due to lack of protection by the state may not have the
similar impact as experiencing the disappearance of a signifi-
cant other due to violations conducted by the state. In the latter
case, it is possibly more likely that the missing person is still
alive, but those left behind may avoid searching for the missing
person out of fear for prosecutions or reprisals. In addition,
professional support may be less available in the case of dis-
appearances due to state terrorism because, among others, pro-
fessionals are at risk to become a victim of state terrorism as
well. Enhancing knowledge about the similarities and differ-
ences in psychological consequences but also assessments of
needs and barriers to care for relatives of missing persons in the
context of war and state terrorism may be relevant for devel-
oping support tailored to the needs of people with different
types of enforced disappeared relatives.
Disappearances outside the context of war and state terror-
ism may occur in a wide range of circumstances varying in
intentionality (e.g., deliberately leaving without informing
relatives vs. being murdered and hidden or accidentally drown-
ing; Biehal, Mitchell, & Wade, 2003). As an example, consider
the incidence rate of persons reported as missing to the
Australian police. This rate (1.55 per 1,000 yearly) is higher
than the number of reports of sexual assault, homicide, and
unarmed robbery combined (Henderson, Henderson, &
Kiernan, 2000). Expanding the focus of research from disap-
pearances due to war or state terrorism to other types of dis-
appearances is of interest for at least two reasons.
First, the type of disappearance might be a risk factor for
the development of psychopathology, as the type of death is
a risk factor for the development of psychological symp-
toms in the bereaved (Lobb et al., 2010). For example,
violent deaths are associated with increased complicated
grief symptoms (Kaltman & Bonnano, 2003; Lobb et al.,
2010). This might also be the case for disappearances that
are probably caused by an act of violence (e.g., kidnapping)
compared to accidental disappearances (e.g., drowning acci-
dent). Enhancing our knowledge about severity and corre-
lates of psychopathology related to different types of
disappearances may facilitate identifying people at risk for
developing post-disappearance psychopathology.
Second, studying post-disappearance psychopathology out-
side of the context of war or state terrorism could verify to what
extent the results of our review are applicable to relatives of
missing persons in general. With the exception of studies that
are focused on relatives of men listed as MIA/POW, inherent to
the studies about relatives of enforced disappearances due to war
or state terrorism are the confounding effects of the (1) exposure
to additional potential traumatic events (e.g., torture and death of
family members) and (2) ethnic background of the participants.
It has been repeatedly shown that cumulative trauma heightened
the risk of development of psychopathology (e.g., Johnson &
Thompson, 2008). Previous research also support that intensity
of grief-related distress differs as function of ethnic background
(Laurie & Neimeyer, 2008; Oltjenbruns, 1998). Studies in West-
ern societies outside the context of war and state terrorism could
explore to what extent the results of our review are applicable to
relatives of missing persons without the confounding effects of
cumulative trauma and ethnic background.
Methodological Improvements for Future Research
Our review revealed several methodological drawbacks in the
literature. First, only 5 of the 11 studies assessed prevalence
rates of psychopathology. Other studies did assess psycho-
pathology but used nonvalidated measures and/or measures
without established cutoff criteria for determining "caseness"
of psychological disorders (e.g., Munczek & Tuber, 1998).
Future research should use validated measures, preferably clin-
ical structural interviews, for assessing the severity of psycho-
pathology among those left behind in order to gain more
insights into the extent of the mental health issues. Noteworthy
is that the majority of the studies reporting interview-based
prevalence rates focused on PTSD and depression. Prevalence
rates of complicated grief, conceptualized and measured in
Lenferink et al. 11
different ways, were only studied twice (Heeke et al., 2015;
Pe
´rez-Sales et al., 2000). Two other studies (Campbell & Demi,
2000; Powell et al., 2010) did use a measure assessing grief
manifestations, but these measures were not validated or lacked
an established cutoff. Likewise, studies including measures of
complicated grief are not self-evident in the literature about
psychopathology following the death of a loved one (Kristen-
sen et al., 2012; van Denderen et al., 2015). It has been repeat-
edly shown that complicated grief shows overlap with, yet is
distinguishable from depression and anxiety (e.g., Boelen &
van den Bout, 2005; Prigerson et al., 1996). In order to encour-
age further research into complicated grief, persistent complex
bereavement disorder (PCBD) has been included as condition
for further study in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (American Psychiatric Associa-
tion [APA], 2013). Expanding the study of PCBD to relatives of
missing persons might yield more insight into normal and dis-
turbed grief processes of individuals who experience this unique
type of loss.
A second methodological drawback of existing studies
focused on psychopathology in relatives of missing persons
is that only one study examined multiple potential correlates
of psychopathology in relatives of missing persons simultane-
ously in one regression model (Heeke et al., 2015). Results of
zero-order correlational analyses might be spurious due to con-
founding effect of other variables. Two other studies also per-
formed regression analysis but also included participants of the
comparison group in the analysis, and as a result, these analyses
do not reflect the unique effect of the disappearance (Barakovic
´
et al., 2014; Powell et al., 2010). More research that examines
potential associated variables of psychopathology simultane-
ously is needed to gain more insights into psychological vari-
ables underlying the occurrence and maintenance of
psychopathology. Up until now, correlational studies primarily
focus on the association between psychological symptoms and
background characteristics and number of experienced traumatic
events. Theories about complicated grief and PTSD following
the death of a loved one highlight the importance of cognitive
and behavioral variables, as well as attachment styles, in the
development and persistence of complicated grief and PTSD
symptoms (e.g., Boelen, van den Hout, & van den Bout, 2006;
Ehlers & Clark, 2000; Maccallum & Bryant, 2013; Shear &
Shair, 2005). It would be interesting to study whether these
variables are also associated with psychological symptoms fol-
lowing the disappearance of a loved one. This may help to
identify individuals at risk for development of psychological
symptoms following the disappearance of a loved one and to
develop interventions to target these variables in treatment.
Third, all reviewed studies used a cross-sectional design.
Longitudinal studies are needed to gain knowledge about pro-
spective risk factors for the development and maintenance of
psychopathology in relatives of missing persons.
Fourth, although most of the reviewed studies consisted of
clustered data (i.e., multiple relatives of the same missing per-
son), none of the studies used statistical techniques that could
handle this clustering. Ignoring the nested structure of the data
heightens the risk of spurious significant results. Using multi-
level modeling could solve this problem in future research.
Fifth, the results of the comparative studies are highly likely
biased due to again a lack of use of validated measures and
solely use of mainly nonprobability samples that consisted of
relatives of enforced disappearances that were exposed to addi-
tional traumatic events that might interact with psychopathol-
ogy. Moreover, due to nonprobability sampling methods, the
generalizability of the results to relatives of missing person
within the same context is also limited. Comparative studies
using probability sampling methods outside the context of war
and state terrorism could give more insights into the unique
potential differential effect of the disappearance and the death
of a loved one on severity and correlates of psychological
symptoms in those left behind.
Sixth, multiple studies were excluded from the current review
because they did not distinguish between relatives of missing
persons and relatives of formerly missing persons (e.g., Greif &
Hegar, 1991) or individual confronted with other potential trau-
matic experiences (e.g., Al Obaidi & Atallah, 2009). Future
research could benefit from subgroup analyses to explore the
potential differential effect of the disappearance of a loved one.
Conclusion
The small number of studies and heterogeneity of the studies
limit understanding of the complex and unique experience of
those left behind after the disappearance of a loved one. How-
ever, based on the findings of our review, we conclude (with
caution) that (1) prevalence rates of psychopathology, mainly
described in terms of PTSD and depression, varied consider-
ably among the studies; (2) spouses, parents, and those who are
more exposed to additional traumatic events are vulnerable for
the development of psychological symptoms post-disappear-
ance of a loved one; and (3) the severity of these symptoms
does not significantly differ from homicidally bereaved indi-
viduals in the context of war and state terrorism. Researchers
are challenged to further explore this underresearched field to
gain more insights into the nature, prevalence, and correlates of
psychopathology in relatives of missing persons.

matched the target population and used random sampling to arrive at the sample. The "source" criterion was met if the study included a description of where the sample was drawn from. The "method" criterion was
met if the recruitment or selection procedure of participants was explicitly stated. The "sample size" criterion was met if a power calculation was reported and the sample size was in accord with the power calculation.
The "inclusion/exclusion" criterion was met if a description and justifications was given of inclusion/exclusion criteria. To achieve a score of "adequate," a minimum of three sample criteria had to be met. For control/
comparison group, all types of control/comparison groups were taken into account. The "inclusion" criterion was met if a control/comparison groups was included. The "identifiable" criterion was met if the control/
comparison group was identifiable and a distinction was made between the groups in the study. The source criterion was met if a description was given of the source and recruitment of the control/comparison group.
The "matched" criterion was met if matching or randomizing techniques were applied and described. The "statistical control" criterion was met if statistical differences between the groups were controlled for except
for the primary outcomes or when it was described that there were no statistical differences between the groups. To achieve a score of adequate, a minimum of three control/comparison criteria had to be met. Studies
without a control/comparison group were rated "not applicable" for this domain. For outcome, "outcome" criterion was met if the article clearly stated what measures were used for which purposes and these
measurements were methodologically sound. To achieve a score of adequate in this category, studies must have met the criterion. For follow-up, all study designs were marked as not applicable, due to cross-sectional
design. For distorting influence, controlling for "traumatic events" was used as criterion for the current review since the majority of studies were conducted in the context of war and state terrorism. This criterion was
met if studies in the context of war and state terrorism controlled for exposure to traumatic events. "Other" criterion was met if the study controlled for other confounding variables and gave a clear description of how
and why they controlled for other variables. To achieve a score of adequate in this category, studies in the context of war and state terrorism must have met both of these criteria. Studies outside the context of war or
state terrorism must have met the other criterion in order to achieve a score of adequate. For data reporting, "`missing data" criterion was met if the article reported about how missing data were dealt with. The "clarity
accuracy" criterion was met if data were clearly and accurately presented (e.g., appropriate use of statistics). To achieve a score of adequate, studies must have met both criteria. A final quality level was computed for the
studies as follows: high three or more adequate in applicable domains, moderate two adequate in applicable domains, low one inadequate in applicable domains, very low none adequate in applicable domains.

Declaration of Conflicting Interests
The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to
the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.
Funding
The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for
the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The current
review is part of a PhD project "Living With the Disappearance of a
Loved One," which is funded by the Victim Fund, Foundation for the
stimulation of Bereavement Research, and the University of
Groningen.
Notes
1. We use the term "complicated grief" throughout the article to
denote a pattern of adaptation to the death/disappearance of a sig-
nificant other "that involves the presentation of certain grief-
related symptoms at a time beyond that which is considered
adaptive" (Lobb et al., 2010, p. 674). See Lobb et al. (2010, p.
674) for examples of grief-related symptoms. In previous studies,
the terms "prolonged grief disorder" or "traumatic grief" were used
interchangeably to refer to complicated grief. In recent literature,
grief-related distress may also be referred to as "persistent complex
bereavement disorder" in accord with the fifth edition of the Diag-
nostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychia-
tric Association, 2013).
2. Boss distinguished two types of ambiguous loss: The first denotes
when the loved one is physically present but psychologically
absent (e.g., due to dementia), and the second when the loved one
is psychologically present but physically absent (e.g., when some-
one is reported as missing). Note that within this review, the term
ambiguous loss refers to the physical disappearance of a loved one.
3. There is no consensus on the definition of state terrorism (Aust,
2010). Within this article, we use "disappearances due to state
terrorism" to refer to disappearances that are probably caused by
political repression. Studies included in this review that referred to
"political repression" in their text were referred to as "state
terrorism" in the current review. Studies that referred to "war" in
their text were referred to as "disappearance due to war" in the
current review.
