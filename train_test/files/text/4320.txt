Introduction
Land cover and land uses have distinct meanings. However,
they are often used interchangeably in the literature (Jansen,
Carrai, & Petri, 2007; Koomen & Stillwell, 2007). Land
cover can be observed (e.g., grass, building) whereas land
uses refer to the actual use to which the land is put (e.g.,
grassland for grazing, building for residences; Lambin et al.,
2001). This research focuses on land-cover changes, which
are arguably a major factor of climate change (Ahmed,
Kamruzzaman, Zhu, Rahman, & Keechoo, 2013; Dale, 1997;
Feddema et al., 2005; Pena et al., 2007; Shaw, 1992; Watson
et al., 2000). However, this relationship is not unidirectional;
rather, it is more complex and interdependent (Koomen &
Stillwell, 2007; Lambin, Geist, & Lepers, 2003). For exam-
ple, a change in land-cover pattern (e.g., deforestation) is
likely to affect the climate whereas any climatic changes
(e.g., excessive temperature) are also likely to alter the land-
cover patterns (e.g., deforestation) of an area. As a result, it is
critical to examine whether our land covers are changing sus-
tainably, and in particular, in urban areas, given that urban
land covers are more susceptible to unsustainable changes
due to rapid urbanization (Chang & Franczyk, 2008). Such
an analysis not only enables to monitor changes but also
allows steering urban growth in a more sustainable way
(Meyer & Turner, 1994; Walker, Steffen, Canadell, &
Ingram, 1997).
Sustainable development has been defined as develop-
ment that "meets the needs of the present without compro-
mising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs" (World Commission on Environment and
Development, 1987, p. 8). This general definition has been
expanded with various scopes for sustainable urban develop-
ment such as the concept of smart growth (Li & Yeh, 2000).
Smart growth principles highlight the need to foster compact
development through promoting infill development, and
thereby to preserve open spaces, and to limit the outward
expansion of cities (Berke, Godschalk, Kaiser, & Rodriguez,

Current Policies

Abstract
Urban areas are growing unsustainably around the world; however, the growth patterns and their associated drivers vary
between contexts. As a result, research has highlighted the need to adopt case study based approaches to stimulate the
development of new theoretic understandings. Using land-cover data sets derived from Landsat images (30 m × 30 m), this
research identifies both patterns and drivers of urban growth in a period (1991-2001) when a number of policy acts were
enacted aimed at fostering smart growth in Brisbane, Australia. A linear multiple regression model was estimated using the
proportion of lands that were converted from non-built-up (1991) to built-up usage (2001) within a suburb as a dependent
variable to identify significant drivers of land-cover changes. In addition, the hot spot analysis was conducted to identify spatial
biases of land-cover changes, if any. Results show that the built-up areas increased by 1.34% every year. About 19.56% of the
non-built-up lands in 1991 were converted into built-up lands in 2001. This conversion pattern was significantly biased in the
northernmost and southernmost suburbs in the city. This is due to the fact that, as evident from the regression analysis, these
suburbs experienced a higher rate of population growth, and had the availability of habitable green field sites in relatively
flat lands. The above findings suggest that the policy interventions undertaken between the periods were not as effective in
promoting sustainable changes in the environment as they were aimed for.

2006; Pacione, 2009). As a result, the concept of smart
growth is being applied in different contexts to manage urban
growth in a more sustainable way by reducing the ecological
footprint of an area while enhancing its economy and quality
of life (Queensland Government, 2009b; Tomalty & Curran,
2003; Weitz, 2012).
Numerous studies have been conducted in different con-
texts in identifying the patterns of land-cover changes
(Bohnet & Pert, 2010; Long, Tang, Li, & Heilig, 2007;
Ningal, Hartemink, & Bregt, 2008; Pfeffer, Schlelhas,
DeGloria, & Gomez, 2005; Pijanowski & Robinson, 2011).
These studies have shown that urban areas are growing
unsustainably because growth is taking place in areas critical
to maintain ecological balance. For instance, Pijanowski and
Robinson (2011) have analyzed the rates and patterns of
urban growth in five U.S. regions and found that all regions
gained considerable amounts of urban land, but lost lands
from agriculture, and forest areas. Similarly, in a study in
Cairns, Australia, Bohnet and Pert (2010) reported the loss of
important coastal lowland habitats and agricultural lands.
Based on a prospective analysis, that study also found that
the loss of important habitats including areas of high ecologi-
cal significance within the urban footprint is highly likely
due to increased pressures to develop lands for urban uses
within this designated area. These studies, therefore, high-
light the need for a critical analysis of driving forces associ-
ated with land-cover changes, and to develop land use
policies accordingly so that the ecologically sensitive areas
are protected from urban invasion (Hersperger & Bürgi,
2007).
A growing concern is evident on the adverse impacts of
urban growth on the natural environment. Policy makers are
searching for options to manage land-cover change under the
banner of smart growth or sustainable growth (Liu, 2012).
Being a dynamic system, the present landscape is the result
of past processes; and provides the basis for the formation of
future landscapes (Pena et al., 2007). Therefore, the identifi-
cation of patterns of changes in the past and their associated
processes (i.e., drivers of land-cover change) can facilitate
informed decision making for improved, sustainable, and
environmentally sound land cover in future (Antrop, 2005;
Jansen et al., 2007). Jansen et al. (2007) also have mentioned
that the modeling of land-cover changes helps to understand
the processes of continuing urbanization and can also be of
value in informing policy makers of possible future condi-
tions under different scenarios. Various models have been
developed over the years to support the analysis of the causes
or consequences of land-cover changes (Verburg, Schot,
Dijst, & Veldkamp, 2004). These are commonly classified
into: (a) static versus dynamic, (b) transformation versus
allocation, (c) land use versus land user, (d) deterministic
versus probabilistic, and (e) sector specific versus integrated
(Jansen et al., 2007). Details about the different modeling
techniques have been discussed elsewhere and are not dis-
cussed here (Koomen & Stillwell, 2007). However, the basic
construct of all of these models is that they take into account
the patterns of past changes to model the future land cover of
an area, based on the driving forces associated with such
changes.
Despite research that has identified a number of drivers/
factors that underpin the land-cover changes, they vary
between contexts, and also depend on the type of land-cover
changes under investigation (e.g., nature to urban, nature to
nature). As a result, Verburg, van Eck, et al. (2004) have sug-
gested that case studies of the drivers of land-cover change
can help to identify which factor/theory is more appropriate
in a particular region that can also stimulate the development
of new theoretic understandings.
Based on the above discussion, the objective of this
research is twofold: first, to understand the patterns of land-
cover changes in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, between
1991 and 2001, and second, to identify the drivers that sig-
nificantly influenced land-cover changes between the peri-
ods. Brisbane was chosen to study in this research because
despite being the capital of Queensland, little is known about
the patterns, drivers, and impacts of urban growth in this
context. There are two main reasons for the selection of the
above time interval (1991-2001) to study in this research:
first, the period (1991-2001) witnessed significant policy
changes that could both favorably (e.g., the Environmental
Protection Act 1994) and unfavorably (e.g., construction of
major highways) drive land-cover changes for sustainable
development in the region. As a result, it is critical to under-
stand whether land-cover changes occurred (un)sustainably
in this period, and if so, then what are the impacts of different
drivers/policy changes; and second, a significant change in
land use policy also occurred in the subsequent period (i.e.,
post-2001), and therefore, knowing the impacts of different
drivers in previous period (pre-2001) would enable one to
understand the likelihood of the post-2001 policy impacts on
promoting sustainable urban development in the region.
Drivers of Land-Cover Changes
Driving forces are the forces that cause observed landscape
changes, that is, they are influential processes in the evolu-
tionary trajectory of the landscape (Bürgi, Hersperger, &
Schneeberger, 2004; Pena et al., 2007). Five major types of
driving forces have been identified in the literature: socio-
economic, political, technological, natural, and cultural
(Bürgi et al., 2004; Verburg, van Eck, de Nijs, Dijst, & Schot,
2004). The socioeconomic driving forces are primarily
rooted in the economy. They include consumer demands,
market structure, and structural changes, as well as govern-
mental subsidies and incentives. A common variable in the
economic models of land use change is the distance between
residential and employment locations, as a proxy for the
costs associated with travel (Verburg, van Eck, et al., 2004).
Political driving forces range from infrastructure policy to
policies on nature protection and defense. Cultural driving
Shatu et al. 3
forces include way of life, demography, and the past devel-
opment of a society. Technology has shaped the landscape
enormously. Striking examples are the distinct impacts of
railroads and highways on settlement patterns (Bürgi et al.,
2004). Road expansion and improvement not only lead to
more development but may also lead to a different pattern
through a reorganization of the market structure, which then
feeds back to further infrastructure development (Verburg,
Schot, et al., 2004). The natural/spatial configuration driving
forces can be classified into the following: site factors such
as spatial configuration (e.g., existing land uses and transpor-
tation networks), topography and soil conditions, and natural
disturbances such as global change and mudslides (Bürgi
et al., 2004; Hersperger & Bürgi, 2007).
A number of studies have found that accessibility, and
especially the road network, acts as a major driving force for
the development of cities (Antrop, 2005; Verburg, van Eck,
et al., 2004). Mediterranean landscapes have undergone
major changes, mainly because of population growth (Sonis,
Shoshany, & Goldshlager, 2007). Shi, Wang, Fan, Li, and
Yang (2010) have examined the correlation between popula-
tion growth and land-cover changes in Original-stream Zone
of Tarim River between 1994 and 2005. This work found that
cropland area increased in the region with the increases of
population density at the expense of grassland. Similarly, in
a study in Papua New Guinea, Ningal et al. (2008) found that
agricultural land use increased by 58% and population grew
by 99% between 1975 and 2000. However, this study also
reported that most new agricultural lands were taken from
primary forest; and consequently, the forest area decreased
from 9.8 hectare per person in 1975 to 4.4 hectare per person
in 2000. Population growth has also been identified as a sig-
nificant factor by Pfeffer et al. (2005) in Honduras. This
study reported that in areas of high population density, fal-
lows give way to more intensive land uses between 1993 and
1999 (Pfeffer et al., 2005). Long et al. (2007) found that
paddy fields, dry land, and forested land decreased by 8.2%,
29%, and 2.6% from 1987 to 1994, and by 4.1%, 7.6%, and
8% from 1994 to 2000, respectively, in Kunshan, China. In
contrast, urban settlements increased by 87.6% between
1987 and 1994. This study concluded that industrialization,
urbanization, population growth, and China's economic
reform policies are the four major driving forces that contrib-
uted to land-cover changes in the region. However, after
reviewing different cases, Lambin et al. (2001) found that
neither population nor poverty alone constitute the sole and
major underlying causes of land-cover change worldwide.
Rather, peoples' responses to economic opportunities, as
mediated by institutional factors, drive land-cover changes.
Similar findings have also been reported by Skonhoft and
Solem (2001) in their analyses of macroeconomic factors in
explaining the reduction of wilderness land in Norway
between 1988 and 1994. Based on regression analyses, this
study found that the relative amount of wilderness land (i.e.,
wilderness land as a fraction of the total area within each
county) is negatively related to the level of economic
activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) per
capita. This research also reported that the wilderness land
decreased with the increase of GDP over the period.
Data and Method
This research identifies land-cover patterns and the drivers of
land-cover changes in Brisbane, Australia. Both macro (city
level) and micro level (suburbs) changes were investigated in
this research. The former analysis focuses on the patterns of
changes at the city level (i.e., entire Brisbane) whereas the
latter identifies the drivers of such changes at the suburb
level. Micro level analysis is important to understand detailed
land-cover change patterns whereas the macro/aggregated
level of analysis (e.g., community, city) may show patterns
that remain invisible at the detailed scale, which are impor-
tant in the land use policy and planning process (Jansen et al.,
2007; Veldkamp, Kok, De Koning, Verburg, & Bergsma,
2001). The research also focuses on the temporal dynamics
and measured land-cover changes between 1991 and 2001.
The factors/drivers of land-cover changes were also selected
from different sub-systems (e.g., transport/infrastructure,
population growth, housing market/rent) operating within a
system (e.g., urban) and thereby incorporated in the "level of
integration" concept as identified by Verburg, Schot, et al.
(2004). The following sub-sections describe the methodol-
ogy used to take into account the above issues in this research.
Study Area and Policy Context
This study was conducted in the context of Brisbane, located
in the middle of South East Queensland, Australia (Figure 1).
Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, is one of the fastest
growing cities in Australia, and currently, it is the third larg-
est city in terms of population in Australia. However,
Brisbane is the largest urban local government body (in
terms of size) in Australia with an area of about 1,163 km2
(by excluding areas located at different islands).Amajor por-
tion of the city is undulating and the elevation ranges between
-3.96 m and 706.21 m above the sea level. The city is cen-
tered along the Brisbane River. The spatial extent of the
study area is shown in Figure 1.
Australia has a three-tiered system of urban governance:
federal (national), state and territory, and local government.
The role of each tier in the planning and management of land
uses can be found elsewhere (Williams, 2007), and as a
result, they are not discussed here in detail. Briefly, the fed-
eral government plays little to no role in the formulation of
planning policies in Australia. Examples of federal powers
include trade and commerce with other countries; taxation;
postal, telegraphic, and similar services; quarantine; foreign
affairs; immigration; foreign corporations; and defense.
Significantly for urban planning, these powers do not include
a general power over management of natural resources, plan-
ning, environment, and regulation of land use development.
However, the federal government has certain role to play for
4 SAGE Open
planning in case of national interest (e.g., cross-state collabo-
ration for the construction of motorways or river manage-
ment; Williams, 2007).
The general powers in these sectors (e.g., natural
resources, environment, and regulation of land use develop-
ment) reside with the six state and two territory governments.

This has meant that each state and territory has established
its own planning system complete with statutory, policy, and
procedural frameworks. The administration of these systems
is the responsibility of each state and territory government,
although in practice, they do delegate a number of day-to-
day decision-making functions to local government. Local
government is a creation of the states. Most day-to-day plan-
ning decisions are made at local government level. Bulk of
applications for development or planning permission are
being lodged at local government level and these are assessed
and determined by local councils based on strategic guidance
rather than state governments. However, strategic planning is
usually subject to state government direction. As a result,
Brisbane is subjected to both state level policies in
Queensland and in particular to the South East Queensland
(SEQ) regional policies, and other policies associated with
Brisbane City Council (Queensland Government, 2008,
2009b).
Brisbane has experienced 4.4% population growth
between 1981 and 1991 (from 736,660 to 769,087 persons;
Queensland Government, 2009a). To accommodate such
population growth in a more sustainable way while main-
taining the economic prosperity of the region, the Queensland
Government enacted a range of policies/acts in the subse-
quent period (1991-2001) including the Environmental
Protection Act 1994, the Integrated Planning Act 1997, and
the Water Act 2000. The pre-1991 anticipation of the govern-
ment that population growth will continue in the post-1991
period was proven. Statistics showed that population
increased by 17% between 1991 and 2001 (from 754,042 to
884,054 persons1; Queensland Government, 2009a).
However, to accommodate this further growth while ensur-
ing a balanced economic growth in the region, several major
infrastructure projects were undertaken in this period such as
the construction/upgrade of the Pacific Motorway (M1),
Logan Motorway (M2), Inner City Bypass, and M3 (Figure
1; Queensland Motorways, 2012). Therefore, the period
(1991-2001) experienced both favorable policy changes for
sustainable development (e.g., the Acts) and drivers of land-
cover changes that can lead to unsustainable growth (e.g.,
population, infrastructure).
A further population growth has also been anticipated for
the post-2001 period and the government intended to man-
age such growth in a sustainable way by maintaining the
region's ecological footprint while enhancing its economy
and residents' quality of life. One of the long-term strategic
visions for the Queensland Government (2008) is to build
Queensland as a strong, green, smart, and healthy state by
reducing congestion and by cutting one third of its current
carbon emissions. The SEQ Regional Plan 2009-2031, oper-
ational since 2005, provides specific policy guidelines to
meet these stated goals (Queensland Government, 2009b).
One of the policy guidelines is to identify an Urban Footprint,
as a means to control unplanned urban expansion. The Urban
Footprint establishes a boundary for urban development,
containing urban growth and promoting a higher density
urban form. By consolidating urban growth into an identified
area, travel times and distances can be greatly reduced and
accessibility to essential services improved. The Urban
Footprint identifies land that can meet the region's urban
development needs to 2031 in a more compact form.
As a result, it is critical to investigate the following: (a)
the impacts of the policies undertaken in the 1991-2001
period on land-cover changes, and (b) the differential impacts
of various drivers that influenced land-cover changes
between 1991 and 2001 so that the likelihood of the post-
2001 policy impacts on promoting sustainable urban devel-
opment in the region can be understood.
Data
This research analyzed land-cover changes in Brisbane
between 1991 and 2001. Two Landsat satellite images (5
TM [thematic mapper] and 7 ETM [enhanced thematic map-
per]), one for each period containing scene of WRS-2 Path
89 and Row 79, were acquired from the United States
Geological Surveys (USGS) database. Cloud-free images
were selected based on the highest temporal consistency
(i.e., collected in the same month/season) to reduce the
effects of both seasonal and phonological differences on
land covers (Ottinger, Kuenzer, Liu, Wang, & Dech, 2013).
The Landsat TM and ETM images were captured on
September 6, 1991, and September 9, 2001, respectively.
Both images were geo-referenced and corrected to obtain a
systematic radiometric and geometric accuracy according to
the USGS Level 1 terrain (L1T) correction system based on
ground control points and a digital elevation model (DEM)
for topographic accuracy. Note that the study area covers
only a portion of the whole scene, and as a result, the images
were extracted to the extent of the study area as shown in
Figure 1. The Transverse Mercator projection (within Zone
56) and the Australian Geographic Datum (GDA) 1994 were
applied to the images to match with other spatial data sets
used in this research. The other spatial data sets (e.g., road
network, statistical local area vis-à-vis suburb, digital eleva-
tion model) were downloaded from the Queensland
Government Information website (http://dds.information.
qld.gov.au/dd-s/). In addition, a land use map prepared in
1994 and an aerial photograph acquired by Nearmap in 2004
were collected from the library of Queensland University of
Technology. These were used as reference maps. The former
and the latter were used to assess the accuracy of the 1991
and 2001 land-cover maps generated from the satellite
images.
Derivation of Land-Cover Classes
This research followed the USGS land-cover classification
scheme, which was found to be consistent in this context
according to the data reported by the Australian Bureau of
6 SAGE Open
Statistics (ABS, 2008; Table 1). The supervised classifica-
tion method was used to classify the acquired satellite images
into four broad land-cover types using ENVI 5.0 software
(Table 1). This method was chosen because the researchers
had a priori knowledge of the study area. As a part of the
classification process, a number of training sites were identi-
fied and digitized for each land-cover type based on the ref-
erenced aerial photographs. The number of training sites for
each class varies between 20 (for water body) and 50 (for
built-up areas). In total, 150 training sites were selected for
each period, which was found to be representative of previ-
ous studies on this topic (Cai, Zhang, Pan, Chen, & Wang,
2012; Tan, Lim, Matjafri, & Abdullah, 2010). The training
sites of both images were then analyzed in terms of their
spectral and spatial profiles. Based on the training sites, the
statistical characterizations (i.e., signatures) of each land-
cover class were developed. The maximum likelihood clas-
sification method was then applied with equal priori
probability for all classes--one of the most commonly used
methods in the literature (White, Shao, Kennedy, &
Campbell, 2013). The maximum likelihood classifier calcu-
lated the probability of each pixel belonging to each class
based on their attributes. A filtering technique was also
applied to generalize the classified land-cover images. This
post-processing operation replaced the isolated pixels to the
most common neighboring class. Finally, the generalized
images were reclassified to produce the final version of land-
cover maps for different years. Figures 2 and 3 show classi-
fied land-cover maps of Brisbane for 1991 and 2001
respectively.
An accuracy assessment exercise was then carried out to
identify the quality of the classified images. Using the litera-
ture, a total of 200 pixels were selected from the classified
images of each period based on a stratified random sampling
technique (Ahmed et al., 2013; Bakr, Weindorf, Bahnassy,
Marei, & El-Badawi, 2010; Tan et al., 2010). The selected
pixels from the 1991 satellite image were then matched
against the 1994 land use maps whereas the pixels from the
2001 image were checked against the aerial photograph. The
evaluation results in Tables 2 and 3 show that the overall
accuracies of the classified images (1991, 2001) were 92.5%
and 88.5% in respective year. The high overall accuracies for
both images signify that the selected classes produce very
distinguishable reflectance and are clearly identifiable on
earth surface.
Deriving Land-Cover Changes
The classified data sets of the two periods were used to ana-
lyze their patterns for each period. In addition to analyzing
land-cover patterns, a conversion matrix of land covers (cell
to cell) between the periods was derived using the
"Conditional Or" tool in ArcGIS.
Table 1 shows that only the built-up category bears the
characteristics of urban land use whereas the remaining three
categories are more related to ecologically sensitive land
uses. As a result, the classified images were further reclassi-
fied into built-up and non-built-up categories, and a similar
conversion matrix was derived. These conversion matrices
were then used to examine the patterns of land-cover changes
in Brisbane between the periods.
Measuring Spatial Biases in Land-Cover Changes
In addition to identifying the statistical patterns, this research
further investigates the spatial patterns of land-cover
changes. The aim was to examine whether the conversion
patterns followed any spatial biases or whether they are ran-
domly distributed across Brisbane. As a result, the hot spot
analysis was conducted in ArcGIS based on the percentage
of suburb's lands that were converted from non-built-up to
built-up areas in each suburb (157) in Brisbane. The suburbs
were chosen as a unit of analysis because of their relevance
to planning and policy in Brisbane, Australia. Although all
properties in Brisbane are subject to at least two plans (e.g.,
SEQ Regional Plan, Council's City Plan), many suburbs/
communities in Brisbane also have their own local or neigh-
borhood plan as a part of the City Plan. Consequently, these
neighborhood plans are used to focus where growth and
change occur, and to protect the character of housing and
ecologically sensitive areas (e.g., parks and wildlife corri-
dors; Brisbane City Council, 2013).
The hot spot analysis tool calculated the Getis-Ord Gi*
statistics for each suburb based on the proportion of con-
verted land in each suburb and also taking into account the
proportion of conversion in surrounding suburbs. This means
that a suburb with a high percentage may not be a statistically
significant hot spot unless it is surrounded by suburbs with
high percentages of conversion. The tool calculated local
sum of conversion for a suburb and its neighbors and com-
pares proportionately with the sum of conversions associated

and swamps.

with all suburbs; and when the local sum is very different
from the expected local sum, and the difference is too large
to be the result of random chance, a statistically significant z
score results. The hot spot analysis was conducted using the
inverse distance conceptualization of spatial relationship.
This method is suitable for continuous data type and in situ-
ations where the closer the features are in space, the more
likely they are to influence each other. A fixed distance band
was used to generate the hot spots because the data sets were
polygonal in nature (suburbs) with a large variation in sizes.
The Multi-Distance Spatial Cluster Analysis (Ripley's k
function) tool in ArcGIS was used to derive an appropriate
distance band that exhibited maximum spatial autocorrela-
tion (Kamruzzaman, Baker, Washington, & Turrell, 2014).
The tool returned z scores and p values for each suburb.
Investigating the Exurbanization Process in
Brisbane
Further exploratory analysis was conducted to understand
whether the land use conversion patterns in Brisbane could
best be explained with the exurbanization phenomenon.

8 SAGE Open
Crump (2003) has mentioned that exurban development
occurs beyond the suburbs and is outside easy commuting
range to the central city. As a result, the exurban locations are
viewed as the middle ground between densely populated
(urban and suburban) regions and sparsely settled rural
(towns and countryside) areas (Pacione, 2009). Therefore, it
is neither urban nor rural; it may, in fact, represent a new
settlement form that is giving rise to a unique landscape.
Nelson (1992) has identified four principal factors explain-
ing the exurbanization phenomenon: (a) continued decon-
centration of employment and the rise of exurban
industrialization; (b) the latent anti-urban and rural location
preferences; (c) improved technology that makes exurban
living possible (e.g., car); and (d) an apparent policy bias
favoring exurban development over compact development.
To assess the exurbanization process, the converted built-
up areas were spatially classified according to five major
sub-divisions in Brisbane: (a) Inner Brisbane, (b) Northwest
Inner Brisbane, (c) Southeast Inner Brisbane, (d) Northwest
Outer Brisbane, and (e) Southeast Outer Brisbane. Therefore,
the Inner Brisbane area represents the core of the city whereas
both Northwest Inner Brisbane and Southeast Inner Brisbane

are the traditional suburbs in Brisbane. In contrast, according
to Crump (2003), Northwest Outer Brisbane and Southeast
Outer Brisbane possess the quality of exurban areas in
Brisbane. Consequently, the locational preferences of people
to live in these areas were investigated based on population
growth between 1991 and 2001. Therefore, this method is
representative of the second factor of Nelson (1992; i.e., the
latent anti-urban and rural location preferences) as discussed
earlier.
Identifying Drivers of Land-Cover Changes
Given that the driving forces cause observed landscape
changes, such causal relationship needs to be verified objec-
tively and scientifically. Four criteria have been proposed in
the literature to establish causal linkages: (a) associations--a
statistically significant relationship between the cause (inde-
pendent variable) and effect (dependent variable); (b) non-
spuriousness--a relationship that cannot be attributed to
another variable, that is, no third factor creates an accidental
relationship between the variables; (c) time precedence/
order--the cause precedes the effect; and (d) causal mecha-
nisms--a logical explanation for why the alleged cause
should produce the observed effect (Singleton & Straits,
1999). An effort has been made to satisfy these criteria in
identifying the drivers of land-cover changes in Brisbane
through estimating a multiple linear regression model.
The model was estimated using the proportion of non-
built-up land in 1991 that was converted into built-up use by
2001 as an outcome variable. The variable was selected
based on the literature (Ottensmann, 2003). Note that differ-
ent types of models have been estimated in previous studies
to identify drivers of land-cover changes including linear
multiple regression (Skonhoft & Solem, 2001), binary logis-
tic regression (Braimoh & Vlek, 2005; Cheng & Masser,
2003; Nong & Du, 2011), multinomial logistic regression
(Turner, Wear, & Flamm, 1996), aggregated logit model
(Ottensmann, 2003), and so on. The binary logistic regres-
sion model is suitable when the outcome variable is binary in
nature (e.g., 1 = change from non-built-up to built-up areas;
0 = no change). This model is better suited when cell-to-cell
conversion patterns are analyzed. However, unlike the cell-
based analysis, the drivers were identified at suburb (statisti-
cal local area) level in this research, and as a result, analysis
shows that all suburbs in Brisbane experienced some levels
of conversion (min: 0.38%, max: 49.14%). Therefore, the
binary logit model was not suitable to operationalize in this
research. The multinomial logit model is appropriate when
the outcome variable contains discrete conversion categories
(e.g., from vegetation to built-up, from vegetation to water
body, etc.; Hepinstall, Alberti, & Marzluff, 2008). Although
it was possible to categorize the outcome variable into sev-
eral discrete classes to run a multinomial logit model, such
discretization would result in a natural ordering among the

classes rather than different types of conversions. In addi-
tion, such discretization means that minor variations would
not be captured in the model (Ottensmann, 2003).As a result,
a linear regression model was estimated. The outcome vari-
able was also found to be approximately normally distrib-
uted supporting the suitability of linear regression model
(Figure 4).
Potential drivers of land-cover changes as identified in the
literature (discussed in section "Drivers of Land-Cover
Changes") were entered as independent factors in the model.
These included base population of the suburb in 1991, popu-
lation growth within the suburb between 1991 and 2001, dis-
tance to the motorways, distance to the central business
district (CBD), base rental (residential) values (Aus$) in a
week in the suburb in 1996, changes (%) in rental values
within the suburb between 1996 and 2001, proportion of sub-
urb land that was designated as built-up in 1991, topography
(average slope), and proportion of individuals born in
Australia. Clearly some of the included factors meet all the
four criteria used to assess causal relationships (e.g., popula-
tion growth, changes in rental values). Although other fac-
tors do not satisfy the time precedence criterion (e.g., slope,
Australian), these factors were derived based on the well-
developed literature on this topic, and they together corre-
spond to the five categories of drivers as discussed in section
"Drivers of Land-Cover Changes."
Straight line distance from each converted cell to the
motorway and CBD was derived. These were subsequently
averaged for each suburb. The distance to CBD variable
reflects both accessibility and economic types of driver
because most of the jobs and higher order goods and services
(e.g., banks) are located in the CBD whereas the distance to
motorway variable represents an accessibility type of driver.
The 1996 and 2001 census data were used to obtain the aver-
age weekly rental (residential) values associated with each
suburb and their changes. The census data were downloaded
from the ABS website (http://www.abs.gov.au/). Originally,
the rental value data were coded at census collection district
(CCD) level (the smallest administrative unit used to collect
census data in Australia). This was summarized to get an
average rental value at suburb level (suburb is the next higher
level unit of CCDs). The rental values were assumed to be
representative of property values in these suburbs, and there-
fore, they represent an economic type of driver associated
with land-cover changes. This is due to the fact that a higher
conversion rate was expected (demanded) at lower priced
land. The amount of urban land that existed in 1991 repre-
sents the spatial interaction/neighborhood effect. Urban
expansion is only possible if there are lands available to
build new houses. Number of population within a suburb
indicates their habitability. Verburg, Schot, et al. (2004) have
mentioned that urban expansion is often situated right next to
the already existing urban area. One of the biophysical/natu-
ral characteristics included in this study is the elevation
(slope), which has been identified to be directly related to
settlement patterns (Verburg, van Eck, et al., 2004). The pro-
portion of people born in Australia represents cultural fac-
tors. About 71.5% of the people in Brisbane were born in
Australia. Any pattern of this factor would indicate the exis-
tence of social segregation in land-cover conversion pattern.
The regression analysis was conducted using the Enter
method, and the multicollinearity among the variables was
checked based on the Eigenvalue and Condition Index
method.
Results
Patterns of Land Cover in Brisbane
Upland natural areas were the main land-cover type in 1991,
which comprised of 39.51% of the total land area in Brisbane
(Table 4). An approximately equal proportion of areas
(36.88%) were found to be dense vegetated land in this
period in Brisbane, followed by built-up (21.61%) and water
body (2%). The overall patterns of land-cover classes
changed dramatically in 2001 (Table 4). Built-up areas were
the dominant land covers (35.10%), followed by dense veg-
etation (32.17%), upland natural (30.77%), and water bodies
(1.96%).
Patterns of Land-Cover Changes in Brisbane
Table 4 shows that built-up areas increased by 13.49% from
25152.39 hectares in 1991 to 40850.64 hectares in 2001.
This overall rate of urban growth was, therefore, lower when

compared with the population growth rate (17%) in this
period as discussed in section "Study Area and Policy
Context." This means that, on average, built-up areas
increased by 1.34% every year from 1991. Table 4 shows
that from 1991 to 2001, there was a rapid decline in the
upland natural and dense vegetation. Upland natural
decreased by 8.74%, whereas dense vegetation decreased by
4.71% between the periods. However, water decreased by
0.04% between the time periods. Tables 5 and 6 show spe-
cific land-cover change patterns between the periods.
Table 5 shows that a substantial change in the land-cover
patterns occurred between the periods. About 91.4%
(22997.25 hectares) of the built-up lands in 1991 remained
built-up in 2001 whereas 80.43% (73375.74 hectares) non-
built-up lands in 1991 remained non-built-up in 2001. These
findings signify that around 19.56% of the non-built-up lands
in 1991 were converted into built-up lands in 2001. Besides,
Table 5 shows that only 8.56% of the built-up areas in 1991
were converted into non-built-up usage in 2001. Figure 5
shows the locations of these changes in Brisbane. It is appar-
ent from Figure 5 that urban growth (both from non-built-up
to built-up and the opposite) took place across the city. Also
noticeable from Figure 5 is that the conversion into built-up
area took place mainly in the outskirts of the city. Table 6
details the contribution of different non-built-up categories
to the formation of built-up lands in 2001.
It is clear from Table 6 that almost every land-cover cat-
egory in 1991 received land from all other categories as well
as contributed to the formation of all other categories in
2001. The diagonal cells in Table 6 show that the most dra-
matic changes took place in the upland natural areas. Only
61.02% of the upland natural areas in 1991 remained vege-
tated in 2001. This means that 38.98% (17923.41 hectares)
of the upland natural areas were converted to form the other

land classes. Among them, the upland natural areas contrib-
uted most to the formation of built-up areas (29.78%), dense
vegetation (9.5%), and water bodies (0.16%).
The next dramatic changes took place in the dense vegeta-
tion category. About 23.70% (10169.91 hectares) of the
dense vegetation lands in 1991 were converted into different
land-cover types. Table 6 shows that these conversions were
mainly to form the upland natural (14.62%) and built-up
(8.97%) areas. According to Table 6, a very small portion of
the built-up areas in 1991 were converted into upland natural
(5.79%), followed by dense vegetation lands (2.11%).
Moreover, the conversions from dense vegetation and upland
natural lands into water body areas were estimated 0.66%
and 0.09% respectively. About 328 hectares of water body
were converted into different types of land classes between
1991 and 2001. Among these, 310.5 hectares were converted
into built-up, followed by upland natural (15.03 hectares),
and dense vegetation land (2.88 hectares).
Figure 6 shows the locations of the conversion patterns
for different land classes within the study area. Clearly,
Figure 6d shows that the coastal areas located in the east of
Brisbane were subjected to conversion from water body to
built-up areas. However, the conversions to the built-up areas
were mainly in the southern and northern part of the city.

Spatial Biases in the Conversion Pattern: From
Non-Built-Up to Built-Up Areas
Figures 5 and 6 show that the conversion from non-built-up
into built-up usage took place mainly in the outskirts of
Brisbane. However, some orange spots are clearly evident
within the inner city areas (Figure 5). Despite the existence
of orange spots in different places in Figure 5, the hot spot
analysis results in Figure 7 confirm that the rate of conver-
sion was significantly higher in the southernmost and north-
ernmost suburbs (brown and orange colors) whereas some of
the inner suburbs experienced a significantly lower rate of
conversion (greenish color). Therefore, the conversion pat-
tern shows some levels of sectoral bias in Brisbane.
Conversion From Non-Built-Up Into Built-Up
Areas and the Process of Exurbanization
The spatial distributions of the converted lands within the five
major sub-divisions in Brisbane are shown in Figure 8. Table
7 shows that although the population in Brisbane grew by
17.24% between 1991 and 2001, population growth in exur-
bia averaged 24.17%. In 2001, 499,606 people lived in the
exurbs of Brisbane, with the greatest numbers of exurbanites

living in the north (33% of Brisbane's population) compared
with south (23% of Brisbane's population). Despite the total
number being higher in the north in 2001, the rate of growth
was, however, significantly higher in the south (27% in the
south compared with 22% in the north) between the periods.
In addition, the conversion pattern was significantly higher in
the south (Figure 7;ABS, 2014). The findings suggest that the
south experienced the exurbanization process more inten-
sively between the periods than the north. This could be due
to the fact that the north experienced the exurbanization pro-
cess earlier than the south as evident in their population figure
in 1991. Consequently, the north possessed little habitable
land to accommodate further conversion between 1991 and
2001. The exurbanization phenomenon was further confirmed
with the lowest rate of population growth within the inner
suburban areas (even lower than the Inner Brisbane area), as
advocated by Pacione (2009).
Despite the evidence of exurbanization process, the fol-
lowing is not known: "Why did the exurbanization process
take place?" or "why were the conversions so high in those
hot spot areas?" or "was it only because of the transport cor-
ridor or did other factors contribute to the high conversion
pattern in those areas?" The results from the regression anal-
ysis answered these questions as discussed below.

Drivers of Land-Cover Changes in Brisbane
Table 8 shows the results found from the regression analysis
in identifying the drivers of land-cover changes (from non-
built-up to built-up) in Brisbane. About 40% of the variance
in data was found to be explained by the factors considered
for regression analysis. This was also found to be representa-
tive of previous studies (Skonhoft & Solem, 2001; Verburg,
van Eck, et al., 2004). The part and partial correlations and
the multicollinearity analysis results, using all the explana-
tory variables entered in the regression model, showed that
none of the explanatory variables had a lower level of toler-
ance value. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was found to
be acceptable for all factors (Table 8). The collinearity diag-
nostics (based on the Eigenvalue and Condition Indices) also
confirmed that there were no serious problems with
multicollinearity.
Among the different factors considered, four of them were
found to have significant association with the conversion of
non-built-up areas into built-up areas (e.g., slope, population
in 1991, population growth between 1991 and 2001, and % of
suburb area as built-up in 1991). The standardized beta coef-
ficients in the model show that the "population growth"
within a suburb was the main driver of urban growth in that
suburb in Brisbane between the periods. Moreover, a positive
coefficient of the "suburb population in 1991" indicates that
urban growth was higher in those suburbs where the popula-
tion was already higher in 1991. However, this is only true in
those suburbs where there were lands available to accommo-
date further growth. A negative coefficient of the "percent of
suburb area as built-up in 1991" factor suggests that urban
growth was significantly lower in already built-up areas. In
addition, a negative coefficient of the "slope" factor indicates
that the conversion process was significantly lower in hilly
suburbs. In summary, the above findings signify that urban
growth took place in those suburbs where there was pre-
occupied habitation but with the potential to accommodate
more people in terms of available flat lands.

Discussion and Conclusion
This research is the first of its kind in the context of Brisbane
that empirically investigates the patterns of land-cover
changes between 1991 and 2001, and also identifies their
associated driving forces. The findings from this research
bear important policy implications for Brisbane vis-à-vis
Queensland in Australia, given that the drivers of land-cover
changes vary depending on the context (Verburg, van Eck, et
al., 2004). However, the lessons learnt from this research can
effectively be used to make an informed land use policy deci-
sion around the globe (Antrop, 2005; Jansen et al., 2007).
The Queensland Government aimed at promoting sustain-
able urban growth by enacting various policies and Acts
(e.g., the Environmental Protection Act 1994, the Integrated
Planning Act 1997). The analyses presented in this research
enabled us to evaluate the effectiveness of such policy mea-
sures based on an understanding of the patterns of land-cover
changes and by identifying their associated processes.
The findings presented in this study clearly show that the
policy interventions undertaken in the study period (1991-
2001) were not as effective in promoting sustainable changes
in the environment as they were aimed for. Most new devel-
opments took place in green fields, thereby increasing the
ecological footprint in the city (Tewolde & Cabral, 2011).
The influence of nature protection policies (e.g., the
Environmental Protection Act 1994) was found to have little
role because about 3,850 hectares of vegetated lands and
13,692 hectares of upland natural lands in 1991 were con-
verted into built-up areas in 2001.
The results from both the exploratory (e.g., hot spot,
descriptive statistics showing population growth with differ-
ent sub-divisions of Brisbane) and confirmatory (e.g., regres-
sion) analyses showed the evidence of exurbanization
process in Brisbane. The hot spot analysis showed that the
conversions were significantly clustered in the outer
(Northern and Southern) parts of the city. Population growth
in these areas was significantly higher, whereas the popula-
tion growth in Inner Suburb areas was significantly lower.
Consistent with prior studies (Pfeffer et at., 2005; Sonis et
al., 2007), results presented in this study showed that popula-
tion growth is the main driving force of land-cover change in
Brisbane. From this perspective, the findings clearly justify
that the current land use policies (e.g., South Queensland
Regional Plan 2009-2031) are more promising in Brisbane in
promoting sustainable urban growth. This is due to the fact
that the current policies aim to accommodate population
growth through facilitating development in a more compact
way--that is, smart growth--either through infill develop-
ment or through increasing density in some selected nodes or
activity centers (Queensland Government, 2009b). The cur-
rent policy would also be effective because it identified
urban footprint areas, and all developments must be located
within the footprint to protect, manage, and enhance the
region's biodiversity values and associated ecosystem ser-
vices and maximize the resilience of ecosystems to the
impacts of climate change. However, care must be taken to
protect the natural lands located within the urban footprint
areas.
In addition to verifying the demographic hypothesis (pop-
ulation growth) of land-cover changes, this research also
verifies the natural configuration hypothesis that topography
(e.g., steep slope) can act as a natural constraint on urban
growth (Müller, Steinmeier, & Küchler, 2010). However, the
insignificant influence of the ethnicity (e.g., percent
Australian) factor falsified the cultural hypothesis of land-
cover changes in this context (Bürgi et al., 2004; Hersperger
& Bürgi, 2007; Zeug & Eckert, 2010). This is also true in
case of technological (access to motorways) and economic
(access to CBD, rental values) drivers.
Despite the evidence of exurbanization process presented
in this research, the findings are not complete because a
number of other relevant factors were not analyzed in this
research. Pacione (2009) has indicated that exurbia tends to
be dominated by middle-class residents, many of whom
commute long distances to work in the city or in the newer
suburbs. Other groups are also present in the exurban loca-
tions including retirees and young households seeking social
status, more land, and new housing at a lower cost than is
available in the suburbs. In addition, this study investigates
the exurbanization process only within the local government
boundary of Brisbane. It is possible that the exurbanization
process was more pronounced outside the study area bound-
ary. Future research should seek to explore this issue in a
wider geographic context by utilizing the above omitted
indicators and improve on the model presented in this
research. Despite the rental values being considered in this
research as a proxy of land value, the results were somewhat
surprising showing their insignificant impacts on urban
growth in this context. Future studies should utilize the land
value data to verify the findings reported in this study. In
addition, although evidence in this research shows a surpris-
ing and significant land conversion pattern--from built-up
into non-built-up areas--these were not investigated inten-
sively. Future research should examine this phenomenon to
further the knowledge on this topic.
