Results: A total of 1065 DEGs were identified in patients with NS (n ¼ 10) vs those in remission
(n ¼ 9). These DEGs correlated with cytokine and/or immune system signalling and the
extracellular matrix. Comparisons between SSNS (n ¼ 6) and SRNS (n ¼ 4) identified 1890
DEGs. These markers of steroid responsiveness were enriched with genes related to the cell cycle,
targets of microRNAs, and genes related to cytokines.
Conclusions: Meaningful DEGs were identified. Additional studies with larger numbers of
patients will provide more comprehensive data.

Introduction
The first-line therapy for children with
idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) is
steroid treatment, which induces remission
in most patients.1­3 The main clinical prob-
lems associated with steroid-sensitive NS
(SSNS) are frequent relapse and subsequent
drug toxicity.4 Patients with steroid-
resistant NS (SRNS) who do not respond
to steroids and other treatments are at risk
of the deterioration of renal function leading
to end-stage renal disease.5,6 Both SSNS and
SRNS are associated with effacement of
glomerular epithelial cell (podocyte) foot
processes, a cardinal morphological feature
of NS.7 The aetiology of podocytopathy
resulting in NS, reasons for steroid non-
responsiveness, and the mechanisms under-
lying relapse in SSNS remain to be fully
established.8
It has been speculated that the patho-
physiology of SSNS involves disturbance of
the immune system, especially T cells. This
speculation is based on findings including
the association between NS and lymphoma
in some cases, relapse coinciding with infec-
tion, response to various immunosuppres-
sive medications, and imbalances of a
subpopulation of lymphocytes.3,9­12
Several cytokines and other soluble plasma
components may also be associated with
NS.13,14 A case has been described in which
SSNS disappeared after bone-marrow trans-
plantation,10 suggesting that hematopoietic
cells are involved in the pathogenesis of
SSNS. SRNS has been shown to recur after
kidney transplantation in some patients,
suggesting that the pathogenesis of this
condition resides outside the kidney; in
addition, the efficacy of plasmapheresis in
most recurrent cases indicates the presence
of circulating factor(s) that cause SRNS.15,16
However, these contributing factors remain
to be identified and validated.17­20 Although
immunosuppressive agents are effective in
some patients with SRNS, there are cur-
rently no tools to determine the optimal
treatment for a patient before a therapeutic
trial, or for predicting recurrence after
kidney transplantation.15,21
Comprehensive information regarding
NS would lead to a better understanding
of the pathogenesis of the disease, mechan-
ism of relapse, optimal medication choice,
and prediction of prognosis. Thus, the
present study applied whole-transcriptome
sequencing of peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with
NS, using a next-generation sequencing
(NGS) method of RNA sequencing.22
PBMCs were used because of the high
probability of immune system involvement
in the pathogenesis of NS, and their easy
accessibility, a prerequisite for a useful bio-
marker.23,24 Compared with microarray
Kang et al. 949
technologies, RNA sequencing can capture
the dynamic range of transcriptomes in
terms of both expression profiling and dif-
ferentially expressed isoforms (DEIs) on a
massive scale.25­27 We report the prelimin-
ary results of signature gene sets of NS and
steroid responsiveness.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited children aged <18 years
who were newly diagnosed with idiopathic
NS at Seoul National University Children's
Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea, between
January 2008 and December 2011. Patients
who were on long-term treatment prior
to transfer to our hospital were excluded
from the study. Pathological diagnosis was
obtained only in patients with SRNS.
The study was approved by the Seoul
National University Hospital Institutional
Review Board (No. 0812-002-264), and the
participants' parents or legal guardians
provided written informed consent prior to
enrolment.
Sample collection
Peripheral blood samples were collected from
patients and PBMCs were isolated using
Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifuga-
tion, then stored at À80C until RNA extrac-
tion. Nephrotic samples were collected at the
time of onset or relapse of NS, before
commencing any treatment. Remission sam-
ples were collected from patients with SSNS
during remission, when having not been
taking steroids for >2 months.
Whole-transcriptome sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs
using a QIAamp RNA mini kit (Qiagen,
Austin, TX, USA). Libraries were prepared
based on the Illumina protocol according to
the manufacturer's instructions, and 54 bp
of paired-end RNA sequencing data were
generated using the Illumina Genome
Analyzer IIx (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA). The prepared libraries were quanti-
fied using quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) according to the quantifica-
tion protocol guide in the manufacturer's
instructions. The read quality was checked,
then the differentially expressed gene (DEG)
sequences were identified using R package
DEGseq (version 1.10.0),28 through count-
ing the reads and assessing the distribution
of count differences between samples. Raw
read quality scores and read counts were
summarized.
For annotation, RNA sequence reads
were aligned to the human reference
genome (University of California, Santa
Cruz [UCSC] hg19; 20 October 2011) using
TopHat software (version 1.4.0)30 and
Bowtie software (version 1.12.5),31 with the
supplied annotations, a set of gene-model
annotations and known transcripts, and the
­no-novel-juncs option to disable mapping
for novel splice junctions.29­31 The aligned
reads were quantified with Cufflinks (version
1.3.0) to obtain the fragments per kilobase
of exons per million fragments mapped
(FPKM) values for the genes or gene tran-
scripts, and then merged into an expression
table for the next analysis step, outlined in
Figure 1 and conducted as described.31
Expression profiling and functional
annotation
The average number of reads produced from
each sample was 74 million. Only those of
protein coding genes listed on the UCSC
Genome Browser32 were analysed. Loci with
low variance in FPKM values or zero reads
across all samples were removed. Variance-
stabilizing normalization and upper-quartile
normalization were applied to the boost
sensitivity without a loss of specificity.33
The DEGs were obtained from one-way
analyses of variance (ANOVA) for
950 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
each group, and false discovery rate (FDR)
multiple testing corrections were applied.
Post-hoc analyses were performed to detect
the relationships between groups via the
Tukey's honest significance test. Analyses of
DEIs were performed similarly, but no
significant DEIs were obtained.
The DEGs of the groups of interest were
obtained by t-tests. For functional annota-
tion and clustering, the Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) program (version 2.0.8)
with the Molecular Signatures Database
(version 3.1)34 and the Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated
Discovery (DAVID, version 6.7) were used
to enhance understanding of the underlying
biological relevance.35,36 Clustering analysis
was performed using the kmeans function in
R 3.0.2, which performs k-means clustering
(K ¼ 10 clusters specified) on a given expres-
sion profile for DEGs. The hypergeometric
distribution is used to compute P-values for
Gene Ontology (GO) annotation for clusters
with the Molecular Signatures Database
(version 5.1).34 For upstream analysis of
DEGs, gene-sets of microRNA targets
(n ¼ 221) and transcription factor targets
(n ¼ 615) from Molecular Signatures
Database (version 5.1) were downloaded
and compared with DEGs.34
Results
In total, 18 patients with idiopathic NS were
enrolled (15 males/3 females; mean age
8.2 Æ 4.0 years; age range 2.7­16.7 years).
The median age at onset of NS was 5.9 years
(range 3.0­14.4 years). Nephrotic samples
Figure 1. Workflow of the RNA sequencing data analysis in a study investigating disease markers of
paediatric idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) and steroid responsiveness. First, a pipeline was built to
identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on mRNA expression levels. Functional annotations were
applied to the DEGs, including pathway enrichment analysis, functional annotation clustering, and gene set
enrichment analysis.
Kang et al. 951
(n ¼ 10) were obtained from six patients with
SSNS and four with SRNS. Pathological
diagnosis was obtained only in those with
SRNS, and was focal segmental glomerulo-
sclerosis in all cases. Of the four patients
with SRNS, two responded to cyclosporine
treatment (calcineurin inhibitor [CNI]
responders [CRs]), and two responded to
neither steroids nor CNI (nonresponders
[NRs]). A total of nine remission samples
were collected from patients with SSNS.
The gene expression profile was deter-
mined by analysing 19 samples from 18
patients (one patient provided both a neph-
rotic sample and a remission sample) and 18
551 genes. Statistical analyses identified
1065 DEGs in the NS group (n ¼ 10) relative
to the remission group (n ¼ 9) (Figure 2).
Functional annotations of these genes
revealed that these DEGs were related to
dorsal/ventral pattern formation (enrich-
ment score [ES] 2.05), extracellular matrix
structural constituents (ES 1.75), and actin
binding (ES 1.36) according to the DAVID
functional annotation module. Based on the
GSEA, compared with the remission group,
the gene-expression profile of the NS group
was enriched with genes pertaining to ster-
oid hormones, matrix metalloproteinase
(i.e., enzymes that degrade the extracellular
matrix)-inducing cytokines, extracellular
matrix-receptor interaction, acyl chain
remodelling of phosphatidylglycerol, G b:g
signalling through PI3Kg, CTLA4 inhibi-
tory signalling, the early response to
TGFb1, IL4 receptor signalling in B
lymphocytes, pantothenate and CoA bio-
syntheses, the syndecan 3 pathway, and the
mTOR signalling pathway.
More stringent criteria (P < 0.01 and
>2-fold changes of expression) were applied
to identify the highly significant genes in
idiopathic NS. A total of 49 genes were
found to be significantly upregulated in NS,
and 67 genes were found to be downregu-
lated (Table 1). K-means clustering for 116
DEGs revealed 10 clusters of 3­37 genes,
with enriched GO terms listed in Table 2
(hypergeometric test, P < 0.005). Upstream
analysis revealed that DEGs of NS were
enriched with targets of MIR-370
(P ¼ 0.0163, reported in Wilms tumour)
and MIR-519E (P ¼ 0.0428, clinical rele-
vance not yet known), as well as targets of
transcription factors ATF2, ATF6, EVI1,
HMGA1, IRF8, ITGAL, JUN, MEF2A,
NFAT, PGR, POU3F2, and STAT6.
Gene expression patterns differed signifi-
cantly between SSNS and SRNS (Figure 3),
with 1890 DEGs identified (P < 0.1). These
DEGs were enriched with genes related to
the microtubule organizing centre and regu-
lation of the response to biotic stimuli based
on the GO terms. Based on the GSEA,
compared with the SRNS group, the gene
expression profile of the SSNS group was
enriched with genes pertaining to TGFb1
signalling, the cell cycle and p53 signalling,
Y branching of actin filaments, FoxP3 tar-
gets in T lymphocytes, cytokines IL6 and

IL4, and targets of MIR106B (related to
renal cell carcinoma37) and MIR16
(expressed in the kidneys38).
More stringent criteria (P < 0.01 and >2-
fold changes of expression) were applied to
identify the markers of steroid responsive-
ness. Consequently, 23 genes were selected
(Table 3; enriched GO terms per k-means
clustering Table 4). Upstream analysis did
not reveal any significant findings.
Discussion
This study used whole-transcriptome
sequencing to identify genes that differed in
expression in children with idiopathic NS in
remission or with nephrotic status. Analysis
using t-testing with P < 0.05 revealed 1065
DEGs for NS independent of steroid
responsiveness. These DEGs were enriched
with extracellular matrix structural constitu-
ent/actin binding/cytoskeletal protein bind-
ing according to the GO term of molecular
function, as well as cytokine and/or immune
system signalling related to steroids;
CTLA4, TGFb1, IL4, and mTOR according
to GSEA. IL4 is a representative cytokine of
Th2 immune reactions, and Th2 immune
reactions have been reported to be predom-
inantly associated with childhood NS.11
Additionally, CTLA4 and TGFb1 are
related to immune regulation, and impaired
regulatory T cell function has been reported
in idiopathic NS.39 Upstream analysis
showed that DEGs of NS were enriched
with targets of MIR-370, which is related to
Wilms tumour of the kidneys, suggesting
relevance of DEGs affecting the kidneys.40
Furthermore, among 12 upstream genes,
ITGAL, MEF2A, STAT6 are members of
steroid responsiveness panel genes in U.S.
patents.41 Therefore, the findings of the
present study generally agree with know-
ledge regarding NS. Further refinement of
these results in larger studies will improve
our understanding of NS.

Although steroid treatment is the first-
line treatment for children with NS, it is
associated with significant toxicity.4 For
patients who do not respond to steroid
treatment, initial treatment with steroids
could be harmful as well as ineffective.
Moreover, more aggressive treatments,
such as CNI, rituximab and plasmapheresis,
could induce remission in many patients if
instituted without delay, as seen in recurrent
SRNS after kidney transplantation.15,21
Therefore, the identification of reliable mar-
kers for steroid responsiveness would allow
more directed treatment of paediatric NS.
Patients who are nonresponsive to steroids
could be other treatment options without
delay. In search of markers for steroid
responsiveness in paediatric NS, we identi-
fied a total of 1890 DEGs, and selected 23
genes based on more stringent criteria.
Interestingly, the DEGs of patients with
SSNS (vs SRNS) were enriched in genes
pertaining to the cell cycle and the targets of
microRNAs MIR106B and MIR16, in add-
ition to those related to cytokines. The
emergence of cell cycle-related genes may
imply differences in the proliferative proper-
ties of SSNS and SRNS, which could be
utilized for the development of novel thera-
peutic options. The 23 genes that were
selected as markers of steroid responsiveness
seem heterogeneous, but following refining
with different sets of samples for validation,
list of genes or part of this list can be used as
markers of steroid responsiveness.
Interestingly, comparison of the signature
genes of SSNS with those listed as SSNS in
the patent for ``Kit and method for identify-
ing individual responsiveness to steroid
therapy of nephrotic syndrome''41 did not
reveal any common genes, despite the simi-
larity of the methods, indicating that clinical
utilization of this approach requires further
study. Notably, previously proposed circu-
lating factors indicative of SRNS (cardio-
trophin-like cytokine factor 118 and
urokinase-type plasminogen activator

receptor17) were not found among the DEGs
in the present study, possibly due to the
heterogeneous nature of our study popula-
tion. These proposed circulating factors
were discovered in patients with recurrent
NS after kidney transplantation in which
steroid treatment can achieve remission in
the majority of patients.
The present study has several shortcom-
ings. First, the sample size was small, limit-
ing the statistical power. Additionally, some
relevant DEGs may not have been identified
due to this small sample size. The DEGs
identified in this study were able to clearly
classify the groups, so our approach seems
valid and justifies further studies to identify
disease/therapeutic response markers for
clinical applications. Secondly, although
RNA sequencing was used rather than
mRNA microarrays, DEIs and alternative
splicing pattern differences between groups
were not identified. To discover novel splice
sites and rare transcripts, deep sequencing of
at least 100 million reads of 76bp in length is
required (according to the guidelines of the
Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements Project42).
The insufficient number of reads of this study
(mean 77 million reads with up to 75% of the
reads properly aligned against a reference
genome) could be the reason for the failure in
the DEI search, in addition to the small
number of samples per group. Finally, the
validation of candidate markers of NS or
steroid responsiveness was not performed in
this study. Clearly, many of the DEGs are
not linked to pathogenesis but rather are the
results of or surrogate changes due to disease.
A validation study may be helpful in dis-
criminating these differences.
In conclusion, whole-transcriptome
sequencing of PBMCs found that DEGs of
NS were enriched in immune system signal-
ling, and potential therapeutic targets were
suggested. Further studies with larger num-
bers of patients will provide more compre-
hensive information to enable the application
of precision medicine to paediatric NS.
