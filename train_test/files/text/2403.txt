Disadvantaged social environments are associated with adverse
health outcomes. This has been attributed, in part, to chronic
stress. Telomere length (TL) has been used as a biomarker of
chronic stress: TL is shorter in adults in a variety of contexts,
including disadvantaged social standing and depression. We use
data from 40, 9-y-old boys participating in the Fragile Families and
Child Wellbeing Study to extend this observation to African American
children. We report that exposure to disadvantaged environments
is associated with reduced TL by age 9 y. We document significant
associations between low income, low maternal education, unstable
family structure, and harsh parenting and TL. These effects were
moderated by genetic variants in serotonergic and dopaminergic
pathways. Consistent with the differential susceptibility hypothesis,
subjects with the highest genetic sensitivity scores had the shortest
TL when exposed to disadvantaged social environments and the
longest TL when exposed to advantaged environments.
gene­environment | adversity | senescence
Alarge body of research has documented a positive associa-
tion between exposure to disadvantaged social environ-
ments and morbidity and mortality (1, 2). A key mechanism for
explaining this association is chronic stress, which is believed to
degrade physiological functioning (3­6), thus "weathering" the
individual and making him or her less resistant to disease (7, 8).
We examined (i) whether the association between exposure to
a disadvantaged environment and stress biomarkers was evident
in childhood and (ii) whether the association was more pro-
nounced for children carrying specific genetic variants. To
measure the effect of stress on children's physiological state, we
used telomere length (TL) as a biomarker. A recent line of re-
search suggests that accelerated shortening of the telomere, the
(TTAGGG)n
sequence repeat at the end of each chromosome, is
a good biomarker of exposure to lifetime stress (3, 6, 8­11). To
measure the social environment, we used an index based on four
dimensions: economic conditions, parenting quality, family structure/
stability, and maternal depression.
Our analysis extends the existing literature on social environ-
ments and TL in several ways. First, we focus on children, whereas
prior research has focused primarily on adults, with few exceptions
(12). Second, we examine a sample of African American boys
whereas prior research has used mostly samples of whites. Third, we
examine for the first time, to our knowledge, whether the associa-
tion between the social environment and TL is moderated by var-
iations in selected genes. Although recent research suggests that
some people are genetically more sensitive than others to their
social environments (13­15), research on TL has not taken account
of this potential moderating factor. Finally, we use a saliva DNA
source of TL, which we show to be highly correlated with blood
leukocyte TL (see Figs. S2 and S3). Our study validates other
work showing that multiple tissues, including saliva, can be used
to measure TL (16, 17).
Disadvantaged Social Environments and Telomere Length
During DNA replication, chromosome ends shorten with each
cycle of chromosomal replication and cellular division. The repetitive
telomere sequence is sacrificed to protect genetic information near
the ends of chromosomes. In addition, the presence of the telomere
prevents fusion of adjoining chromosomal ends. Over time, due to
each cell division, the telomere ends become shorter, and so the
telomere has been referred to as a "mitotic clock" (11, 18­20). As-
sociated with progressive telomere shortening, the cell activates
signaling events that produce replicative senescence. Salient to this
report, stress appears to augment replicative TL shortening, perhaps
by promoting nonenzymatic hydrolysis of telomere base pairs (11,
18). Stress-related telomere shortening could evoke physiological
weathering in a way similar to aging (8, 18, 21, 22). Research sug-
gests several possible behavioral mediators of the negative asso-
ciation between stress and TL, including smoking, mental illness
(particularly depression), caregiver stress, and obesity (23­25).
Considering the strong association between social deprivation and
these mediators, it is not surprising that some measures of social
standing and social deprivation have also been found to be associ-
ated with TL (8, 9, 17, 26).
Significance
This paper makes two contributions to research on the link
between the social environment and health. Using data from
a birth cohort study, we show that, among African American
boys, those who grow up in highly disadvantaged environ-
ments have shorter telomeres (at age 9) than boys who grow
up in highly advantaged environments. We also find that the
association between the social environment and telomere
length (TL) is moderated by genetic variation within the sero-
tonin and dopamine pathways. Boys with the highest genetic
sensitivity scores had the shortest TL when exposed to disad-
vantaged environments and the longest TL when exposed to
advantaged environments. To our knowledge, this report is the
first to document a gene­social environment interaction for TL,
a biomarker of stress exposure.

The TL literature has focused almost exclusively on adults, al-
though several studies have used retrospective reports to measure
childhood conditions (10), and one prospective study has exam-
ined the association between childhood conditions between ages 5
and 10 and TL (27) and a second study determined that the du-
ration of exposure to institutional care between 22 and 54 mo was
negatively associated with telomere length (12). A second limita-
tion of current TL literature is that most studies are based on
samples of middle-class whites; research on minority children and
children from low-income families is sparse. Finally, existing re-
search on TL has not examined the role of genetic sensitivity in
modifying the association between the social environment and TL.
A growing body of research shows that specific gene variants
moderate the association between the social environment and
children's health and well-being (13­15). Of particular interest are
genes found in the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. We
hypothesized that the association between children's social envi-
ronment and TL would be moderated by specific gene variants.
Results
Our analysis is based on 40 African American boys (age 9) who
participated in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study
(FFCWS). We focused on African American children because
this group is understudied, and we focused on boys because prior
research indicates that boys may be more sensitive than girls to
negative family conditions (14). As described in Materials and
Methods, our sample was chosen to represent extreme environ-
ments, based on the child's family's economic conditions, par-
enting quality, family structure/stability, and maternal depression
(see Materials and Methods for more details about these mea-
sures). Half of the children in the sample were raised in very
disadvantaged environments, and the other half were raised in
advantaged environments. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics
for the variables used to measure children's environments along
with other variables used in the models. Body mass index (BMI)
did not differ between harsh and nourishing environments. Due
to concerns of outliers and influential data points in a sample of
40, we use robust ordinary least squares (OLS) regression (using
Cook's D and Huber weighting), which is 95% as efficient as
traditional OLS (28).
Social Predictors of Telomere Length. Model 1 (M1) of Table 2
shows that living in a disadvantaged environment was associated
with a 19% shorter TL (P = 0.02). The next set of models (M2­M5)
show the associations between boys' TL and each of the envi-
ronmental measures separately. Model 2 (M2) shows that a
doubling of the family income/needs ratio was associated with
a 5% increase in the boys' TL (P = 0.03). To provide more
context for this estimate, in the larger Fragile Families sample
the mean income/needs ratio is 0.7 for children at the 25th
percentile and 2.7 for children at the 75th percentile, which is
equivalent to an 8% difference in TL under this model. As
a robustness test for economic conditions, we also examined the
association between a boy's TL and his mother's education (see
M5 in Table 2). Compared with children of mothers with less
than a high school education, having a mother with a high school
degree is associated with a 32% increase in a child's TL (P =
0.006), and having a mother with at least some postsecondary
education is associated with a 35% increase in TL (P = 0.005). In
sum, family economic status was a significant predictor of a boy's
TL measured in middle childhood. Model 3 shows that a low
score on the parenting quality index was associated with a 3%
decrease in a boy's TL. Finally, model 4 shows that being ex-
posed to multiple changes in family structure was associated with
a 40% decline in a boy's TL (P = 0.010).
Gene­Environment Interactions with Telomere Length. The models
in Table 3 present estimates of the main and interaction effects
of dopamine and serotonin pathway genes and the environ-
mental factor for a boy's TL, controlling for age of the mother
and age 9 standardized BMI. Because there are a variety of ways
to code genetic effects, and no set way of combining multiple
genetic markers, we use two common methods of coding and
summing genetic markers. A key component of this coding is
using the gene­environment interaction literature of these genes
to designate a "sensitizing" or reactive allele. This sensitizing
allele is often the allele typically thought to confer risk, but in
this case that definition would apply only to those in the harsh
environment, whereas those with the same allele would see an
amplification of the positive effect in the nurturing environment.
Our serotonergic sensitivity score sums the sensitizing alleles or
homozygous genotypes composed of sensitizing alleles for four
serotonin markers from two genes (5-HTT: 5-HTTLPR and
STin2; TPH2: rs4570625 and rs1386494). Our dopamine sensi-
tivity score similarly sums the sensitizing alleles or homozygous
genotypes of sensitizing alleles for four dopamine markers (DAT1,
rs40184; DRD4, third exon VNTR; DRD2, Taq1a, rs1800497;
COMT, Val158Met, rs4680). The distribution of specific genotypes

did not differ significantly between subjects in harsh and nourishing
environments (Table S1).
Model 1 and model 2 of Table 3 suggest a significant in-
teraction between the social environmental and the serotonin
sensitivity score (M1: b = -0.22, P value = 0.016; M2: b = -0.21,
P value = 0.049) such that, although the environmental measure
has a negative association with TL, it is the most negative for
those with variants most associated with higher levels of envi-
ronmental sensitivity. M3­M4 shows the interactions for the
dopamine pathway genetic sensitivity scores. Although less de-
finitive than in the case of the serotonergic pathway, the negative
association between the social environment and TL is stronger
for boys with dopaminergic pathway genetic variants most associ-
ated with higher levels environmental sensitivity (M3: b = -0.18,
P value = 0.098; M4: b = -0.07, P value = 0.18).
Fig. 1, Upper shows that, among children with 0 sensitizing
serotonin genotypes, there is little difference in TL between
children in advantaged and disadvantaged environments. How-
ever, for children with higher levels of genetic sensitivity (i.e.,
those with 2+ sensitizing genotypes), we see a large difference. In
fact, consistent with the differential susceptibility hypothesis, the
point estimates suggest that the most sensitive group has the
longer TL in the advantaged environment and the shorter TL in
the disadvantaged environment. This finding implies a geneti-
cally encoded differential sensitivity to the environment using TL
as the biomarker (13­15). Fig. 1, Lower shows a similar (but not
as strong) relationship with dopamine pathway genotypes. Namely,
for boys with 0 sensitizing dopamine genotypes, there is only a
small, insignificant difference in TL by environment, whereas for
boys with 1 and 2+ sensitizing dopamine genotypes, there is a large
and significant difference by environment, with boys with sensitizing
genotypes having the longer TL in advantaged environments and
the shorter TL in disadvantaged environments.
Discussion
Our analysis makes a number of methodological and substantive
contributions. We demonstrate the utility of using saliva DNA
to measure the children's telomere length (SI Text). This is
important in that most TL research uses blood, which is more
difficult to collect than saliva. That saliva DNA is a valid in-
dicator of TL makes it easier and less expensive for researchers
to collect samples of TL at multiple points in time and thereby to
examine how changes in the social environment are associated
with changes in TL (8, 9, 17, 26). A second methodological
contribution is the use of prospective data to measure children's
environmental exposures in real time. Only one study that we
know of used real-time measures of children's environments and
that study examined ages 5­10 (27). Finally, our analysis is, to
our knowledge, the first to examine TL in a sample of African
American children.
Our analysis provides evidence that exposure to disadvantaged
environments in childhood is associated with shorter TL. Decom-
posing the environmental factor into its different components also
provided insight. Here we were able to replicate the positive asso-
ciation between family socioeconomic status (SES) and TL (8, 9, 17,
26) for a sample of children. In addition, we were able to document
significant associations between family structure/stability and TL
and harsh parenting and TL.
Due to sample size limitations, we were not able to examine the
independent effect of each of these measures. Nevertheless, we
tested the measured variables pairwise and found that the SES
measures were the strongest predictors of TL. Although the other
variables maintained the same pattern of association, the coef-
ficients declined dramatically with the inclusion of poverty ratio
and mother's education.

Most importantly, to our knowledge, this report is the first to
examine a gene­social environment interaction for a biomarker,
TL. Using two genetic sensitivity scores (related to serotonin and
dopamine pathways), we found that African American boys with
the highest scores on the serotonin and dopamine pathway ge-
netic sensitivity had shorter TL than their peers when exposed to
disadvantaged social environments and longer TL when exposed
to advantaged environments. A similar pattern was found for the
dopamine pathway genetic sensitivity score.
Our findings on gene­social environment interactions raise in-
triguing questions about the mechanisms involved. We suggest that
an individual's genetic architecture moderates the magnitude and
direction of the physiological response to exogenous stressors.
Materials and Methods
Sample. Our data were taken from two studies: the FFCWS and a benchmark
study designed to provide information on the effect of the sample collection
process and tissue source for TL. FFCWS follows a stratified, multistage,
probability sample of children born in large US cities (200,000+) between
September 1998 and September 2000, with an oversample of children born
to unmarried parents (three-quarters unwed, one-quarter wed) (29). Be-
cause of the large oversample of nonmarital births and because of the urban
location of the study, the children in the sample come from a wide range of
social environments. This feature of the data afforded us greater power to
detect the effects of social environment than an equally sized sample of all
births would have provided. Baseline interviews with mothers and fathers
were conducted within 48 h of the child's birth, and subsequent interviews
were conducted when the focal child was 1, 3, 5, and 9 y old. Saliva DNA
samples were taken at the age 9 follow-up, using the Oragene DNA sample
collection kit (DNA Genotek Inc.). DNA was extracted following the manu-
facturer's protocol and stored at -80° until use. We used data from all five
waves and restricted the analysis to children with genetic information. From
this pool we selected subsamples of children from the most extreme envi-
ronments in the FFCWS. Initially, we identified 40 families based on a three-
step process. In the first step, the sample was constrained to boys meeting
the following conditions: (i) boys provided saliva at age 9 (wave 5) in-home
interview, (ii) whose mother self-identified her race as black or African
American, (iii) for whom no data were missing on the criterion variables
described below, and (iv) who were male.
Next, we arrayed the subsample on an index of advantage­disadvantage
from birth to age 9 based on an equally weighted combination of (i) family
economic conditions, (ii) parenting practices, and (iii) family structure/sta-
bility. Finally, we took children with the 20 highest scores in the disadvan-
taged index whose mothers had experienced at least one depressive episode
and the children with the 20 lowest scores on the index whose mothers had
never experienced depression. Thus, boys who scored highest on this index
(n = 20) lived in homes with high levels of poverty, high levels of family
instability, harsh parenting, and maternal depression. Boys who scored
lowest (n = 20) lived in affluent, stable families and were not exposed to
either harsh parenting or maternal depression. We then assayed the children
for TL.
Telomere Measurement. Telomere length was measured using our modifi-
cation of a quantitative real-time PCR assay that incorporates an oligomer
standard to permit measurement of absolute (in kilobases per chromosome)
rather than relative telomere length (30). Briefly, this method adapts the
approach of Cawthon (31) in which relative telomere length is determined
by quantitative PCR by determining the ratio of telomere copy repeats to
a single-copy reference gene (the gene is 36B4). To determine absolute
telomere length, an 84mer oligomer standard TTAGGG is used to construct
a standard curve. A separate standard curve for the single-copy gene
incorporates a 79mer containing the reference gene 36B4. This enables
calculation of total telomere length per diploid genome, whereas the 36B4
product gives the number of diploid genomes. Length per chromosome is
given by dividing telomere length per genome by 92, the number of telo-
meres per diploid genome. Samples are measured in triplicate and the
results are averaged. Distribution of samples in the 96-well plates was ran-
domized, and each plate contains at least 10 repeats from prior runs to
detect and limit potential batch effects. To mitigate batch effects, reference
DNA from a tel- cell line and the same line after stable integration of tel
were included in each plate. Reference DNA was harvested at a single time,
aliquoted, and frozen. Telomere length was normalized by this reference to
assure plate-to-plate consistency. The coefficient of variation of a standard
(DNA from a 40-y-old female) was 10% across 100, 96-well plates.
The average TL for our sample was 9.9 kb long, with a SD of 3.3 kb. Fig. S1,
Upper indicates that the TL data are positively skewed (even with outliers
removed). The best transformation of the data are the natural log (other
transformations not shown). Fig. S1, Lower shows the distribution and Q-Q
plot of log-transformed TL. Once transformed, both distributions track the
normal distribution fairly well. Due to the close approximation to normality,
we used log telomere length (lnTL) for the remainder of the analyses.
Most prior reports of telomere length have used DNA derived from cir-
culating blood cells. To evaluate TL in DNA derived from blood cells and saliva,
we compared TL in DNA from both origins from 16 volunteers. Telomere
length was significantly greater in saliva than in blood leukocyte-derived
DNA [6.5 kb ± 1.8 SD (saliva) vs. 4.2 kb ± 1.2 SD (peripheral mononuclear
blood cells) P < 0.001] (Fig. S2). However, saliva and leukocyte DNA lengths
were highly and significantly correlated (R = 0.72, P = 0.002) (Fig. S3).
Social Environment Measures. In addition to comparing boys exposed to the
best and worst environments, we also examined the association between TL
and each of the individual components used to construct the disadvantage/
advantage index. To measure the economic conditions of the household, we
used the average income/needs ratio across all five waves of the study. This
measure adjusts total household income by household size and is a better
indicator of economic resources than income alone. To measure the mother's
completed education, we used four categories: (i) less than high school, (ii)
high school graduate, and (iii) at least some college. To measure family
structure/stability, we used four categories: (i) stable two-parent families, (ii)
stable single-mother families, (iii) families with one partnership change, and
(iv) families with multiple partnership changes. To measure harsh parenting,
we used a count of how often mothers engaged in harsh psychological
behaviors (e.g., yelling, threatening) and harsh physical behaviors (hitting,
slapping). These items were taken from the Conflict Tactics Scale (32). To
measure maternal depression, we used the composite international diagnostic
interview (CIDI) short form (33). We measured mother's self-reported age
Fig. 1. ln(telomere length) by environment type and serotonin pathway
(Upper) and dopamine pathway (Lower) homozygous genotype counts. Al-
though the possible range of homozygous genotypes was 0­4, due to the small
number of minor allele frequencies the range is top-coded at 2+. For the se-
rotonin pathway genotypes, the environment effect is borderline for 0 geno-
types (P = 0.09), not significant for 1 genotype (P = 0.32), and significant for 2+
genotypes (P = 0.02). For the dopamine pathway genotypes, the environment
difference is not significant for 0 genotypes (P = 0.63), significant for 1 geno-
type (P = 0.05), and borderline for 2+ genotypes (P = 0.08).

at birth. Father's age is highly correlated with mother's age (0.8) and
was missing from multiple of the single-mother births; therefore, only
mother's age was used. BMI was assessed in the home by an interviewer and
was age-standardized to age 9 to account for slight differences in age
at interview.
Genes and Their Variants. Serotonergic. Our measure of the serotoninergic
pathway comes from four genetic variants each of two genes. First, we use
two length variants within the most studied gene of this system, the serotonin
transporter gene (5-HTT). This gene codes for the protein that recycles the
serotonin from the synapses. The two well-examined variants of the sero-
tonin transporter gene are (i) a functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the
5 regulatory region and (ii) a 17-bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)
in the second intron region (called STin2 VNTR). For the 5-HTTLPR poly-
morphism, the most common alleles are the short (S) 14-repeat and long (L)
16-repeat of a 23-bp incomplete repeat, but other less common repeats are
also found in various populations. Compared with the L allele, the S allele of
the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism has been shown to be associated with reduced
transcription (34). For the STin2 polymorphism, the two most common
alleles are the 10 and 12 repeat, and compared with the 10-repeat allele, the
12-repeat allele is also associated with reduced transcription (35). We also
used variants of the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene (TPH2), which codes
tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of sero-
tonin (36). Alleles of TPH2 have been associated with depression, bipolar
disorder, and other mental health problems (37, 38). We used variants at
two loci related to the TPH2 gene. The first variant is rs4570625, a G/A SNP
that appears associated with reduced transcription rates. Similarly, the sec-
ond variant, rs1386494, a T/C SNP, is also associated with reduced transcription
rates (39).
Due to the novelty of the differential susceptibility model, there is little
guidance in how to code the reactivity of a genetic variant or polymorphism.
To date, most studies have taken genetic markers that were formerly clas-
sified as "risky" and reclassified them as reactive or "sensitizing" (13, 15).
Normally, these risky (now sensitizing) polymorphisms are the variants as-
sociated with lower transcriptional efficiency (15), and this is generally the
case in our study. In combining the serotonergic system variants, we create
two serotonin pathway genetic sensitivity scores by (i) summing the number
of homozygous genotypes composed of sensitizing alleles (5-HTTLPR-S,
STin2-12, TPH2a-G, TPH2b-T) and (ii) summing the number of sensitizing
alleles. This results in a possible score of 0­4 for the first measure and 0­8 for
the second measure.
Dopaminergic. For the dopaminergic pathway, we used one measure each for
four different genes along the dopaminergic pathway. DAT1 (SLC6A3,
5p15.3) is the gene that codes the dopamine transporter protein that
removes dopamine from the synapstic cleft (40). The DAT1 variant (rs40184,
intron 14) is a SNP, and the C allele is associated with reduced transcription
of the DAT1 gene (41). Both DRD2 (Taq1a, 11q23) and DRD4 (11p15.5) code
for postsynaptic dopamine receptors (42). We measured the DRD2 taq1a
variant (rs1800497), which may affect expression of the receptor. For DRD4,
we used the 48-bp VNTR in the third exon. We coded 6­10 repeats as "long"
or 7R alleles (which make up 80% of long alleles) and call the short allele
"4R" because it constitutes 85% of the short (2R-5R) alleles. Finally, catechol-
O-methyltransferase (COMT, 22q11.21) codes for a major enzyme involved in
the inactivation of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, and the Met allele of the
Val158 Met polymorphism (rs4680) is known to decrease COMT activity (43).
Similar to the serotonergic scores, we created two dopamine pathway
genetic sensitivity scores by (i) summing the number of homozygous gen-
otypes composed of sensitizing alleles (the C allele for DAT1, 7R for DRD4,
T allele for DRD2, and Met allele for COMT) and (ii) summing the number of
sensitizing alleles. This results in a possible score of 0­4 for the first measure
and 0­8 for the second measure.
Genotypes for HTTLPR, STin2, and DRD4 were obtained by PCR followed
by gel or capillary electrophoresis, and other variants were determined by
real-time PCR using primer systems supplied by Life Technology.
