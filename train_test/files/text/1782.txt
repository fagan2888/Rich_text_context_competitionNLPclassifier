Background
National guidelines recommend the same approach for treating
hypertensive men and women. It is not known, however, whether
current US antihypertensive medication utilization patterns and
the resulting degrees of blood pressure (BP) control are similar or
different among hypertensive women and men.
Methods
The study was a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey
of the noninstitutionalized civilian US population. Persons aged
18 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999­2004 were classified as hypertensive based on a
BP 140/90mmHg, currently taking antihypertensive medication, or
having been diagnosed by a physician.
Results
Among hypertensives, the prevalence of antihypertensive
medication use was significantly higher among women than
men (61.4% vs. 56.8%), especially among middle-aged persons
(40­49 years, 53.1% vs. 42.7%) and among non-Hispanic blacks
(65.5% vs. 54.6%). Also, treated women were more likely than men
to use diuretics (31.6% vs. 22.3%) and angiotensin receptor blockers
(11.3% vs. 8.7%). Among treated hypertensives, the proportion taking
three or more antihypertensive drugs was lower among women than
men, especially among older persons (60­69 years: 12.3% vs. 19.8%,
70­79 years: 18.6% vs. 21.2%, and 80 years: 18.8% vs. 22.8%).
Only 44.8% of treated women achieved BP control vs. 51.1% of
treated men.
Conclusions
Hypertensive women are significantly more likely to be treated than
men, but less likely to have achieved BP control. Additional efforts
may be needed to achieve therapeutic goals for the US hypertensive
population, especially for hypertensive women.

Hypertension remains a major public health challenge in the
United States. Approximately 72 million Americans are cur-
rently living with hypertension, and the estimated direct and
indirect costs for hypertension in 2007 were $66.4 
billion.1
Effective drug therapies have been available for several
decades and the substantial benefit of hypertension treatment
on coronary heart disease and stroke has been demonstrated
in numerous clinical trials.2­5 However, most population-
based studies indicate that a large proportion of hypertensive
persons who are on drug therapy still have elevated blood
pressure (BP), and a considerable proportion of hyperten-
sive persons are not even treated with any antihypertensive
drug.6­9 As the 
prevalence of hypertension has increased
over the past decade,10 it is important to understand current
antihypertensive medication utilization patterns and to study
their impact on BP control and hypertension-related clinical
outcomes.
Historically, hypertension in women has received little
attention compared to their male counterparts because men
have a higher incidence of total cardiovascular end points at
all ages.11 Early clinical trials of treating mild-to-moderate
hypertension were primarily conducted on a middle-aged
male population, and most decisions regarding hypertensive
treatment for women prior to the 1990's were based on data
obtained from trials done predominately on male patients.
Although some studies have shown that the treatment of
hypertension among women conferred less benefit against
cardiac events compared to antihypertensive treatment
among men,12­14 large long-term clinical trials of antihy-
pertensive treatment include both men and women have not

demonstrated clinical significant gender differences in BP
response and outcomes,15,16 and the national guidelines rec-
ommend the same approach for treating hypertensive men
and women.
Antihypertensive medication use in the hypertensive popu-
lation significantly increased in the past 10 years.17 However,
direct comparison of the reduction of BP using hypertensive
treatment between men and women with the same age, the
same ethnicity, and the same coexisting medical conditions
has not been performed. To understand gender-related dif-
ferences in the treatment and control of hypertension, we
used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999­2004 data to estimate the prevalence of anti-
hypertensive medication use among US adults with hyperten-
sion, to compare the utilization patterns between hypertensive
men and women, and to access the impact of pharmacological
treatment on BP control rates.
Methods
The NHANES 1999­2004 is a continuous cross-sectional
survey based on a nationally representative sample of the
civilian noninstitutionalized US population.18 Survey partici-
pants received a detailed in-person home interview, followed
by a physical examination including BP measurements at a
mobile examination center. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants, and the protocol was approved by the
institutional review board of the National Center for Health
Statistics.
During the home interview, participants were asked, "Have
you taken or used any prescription medicines in the past
month?" Respondents who answered affirmatively were fur-
ther asked to report the name, duration, and main reason for
each product used. An interviewer recorded the exact product
name from the medication container label. If the container was
unavailable, the participant verbally reported this information.
Antihypertensive agents reported by participants in NHANES
1999­2004 were identified and categorized into the following
therapeutic classes: (i) diuretics, (ii) -blockers, (iii) calcium
channel blockers, (iv) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tors, (v) angiotensin receptor blockers, and (vi) other antihy-
pertensive agents (including 1
-blockers, central 2
-agonists,
direct vasodilators, and other centrally acting drugs). A person
who reported using more than one antihypertensive medica-
tion, either as a single-combination pill or as multiple drugs,
was only counted once for the any antihypertensive medica-
tion use category, and once within each drug class category.
Each antihypertensive medication that was reported was, how-
ever, used to compute the total number of antihypertensive
medications used within the past month.
A history of physician-diagnosed diabetes, stroke, conges-
tive heart failure, angina pectoris, heart attack, or coronary
heart disease was also assessed by questionnaire. Serum crea-
tinine19 as well as urine albumin and creatinine20 were mea-
sured according to standard methods. Serum creatinine values
for NHANES 1999­2000 data were corrected according to
the recommended standards.19 Glomerular filtration rate was
estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
equation.21 Chronic kidney disease was defined as either an
estimated glomerular filtration rate <60ml/min per 1.73m2 or
>200mg albumin per gram urinary creatinine.2
BP was measured with the participant in the sitting position
after 5min of rest by trained physicians at the mobile exami-
nation center following a standard protocol. Appropriate cuff
sizes were used for participants based on measurement of
mid-arm circumference. The average of up to three measure-
ments was used. Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic
BP 140mmHg, a mean diastolic BP 90mmHg, currently
taking antihypertensive medication, or being told at least
twice by a physician or other health professional that one has
high BP.1,10 Hypertensive subjects who reported taking any
antihypertensive agent identified from the NHANES prescrip-
tion medication data were considered as treated hyperten-
sives. The NHANES 1999­2004 response rate for completion
of the interview and health examination was 75%.18 Of those,
5,510 adults aged 18 years were identified as hypertensives,
100 subjects were excluded due to lack of prescription medi-
cation data (n = 54) or pregnancy (n = 46). The final analytic
sample was 5,410.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (RTI, Research Triangle Park, NC).22
Sample weights were used to account for differential prob-
abilities of selection and the complex sample design and to
obtain estimates representative of the noninstitutionalized US
population aged 18 years.18 Variance estimates were com-
puted using the Taylor series linearization approximation
approach.23 An estimate with a relative s.e. 30% was consid-
ered statistically unreliable and noted in the tables. Statistical
hypotheses were tested with a t-statistic or a 2, as appropriate.
Trend tests were used to evaluate changes in estimates across
age groups. We also conducted logistic regression analysis to
estimate prevalence of antihypertensive drug use and BP con-
trol rates according to gender, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity,
and comorbidities using predictive marginal probabilities.24
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the hyperten-
sive population by gender are summarized in Table 1. The
average age of women was >5.4 years than men. Compared
to hypertensive men, hypertensive women were more
likely to be non-Hispanic black, to have a higher systolic BP
(143mmHg vs. 138mmHg, P < 0.001), a lower diastolic BP
(74mmHg vs. 79mmHg, P < 0.001), and a higher pulse pres-
sure (68mmHg vs. 59mmHg, P < 0.001). A higher percent of
women had more severe hypertension (BP 160/100mmHg;
women 22.5% vs. men 12.5%, P < 0.001). Women also had
greater prevalences of obesity, chronic kidney disease or
stroke. Men, however, were more likely to be smokers and to
have ischemic heart disease including angina pectoris, coro-
nary heart disease, and/or heart attack.

and comorbidities, specifically among 40­49 years age group
and non-Hispanic black persons. However, women with a
prior history of stroke were less likely to receive drug therapy
compared with their male counterparts.
Among treated hypertensive persons, ~30% used two anti-
hypertensive drugs, and <20% used three or more antihyper-
tensive drugs (Table 2). Treated men and women had similar
proportions for the use of two antihypertensive drugs across
all age and race/ethnicity subgroups. However, women with
kidney disease or ischemic heart disease were more likely than
their male counterparts to receive 2 antihypertensive drugs.
The proportion of use of three or more antihypertensive drugs
was significantly lower among old women than old men.
Table 3 compares the distribution of antihypertensive drug
classes prescribed to hypertensive persons and to those with
hypertensive complications. Both unadjusted and multi-
variable adjusted estimates indicated that nearly one-third
of hypertensive women reported using diuretics in contrast
to less than one-fourth of hypertensive men. Diuretic use
was significantly higher among women than men for those
with diabetes and kidney disease. Women were also more
likely than men to use angiotensin receptor blockers, espe-
cially among those with diabetes. In contrast, angiotensin-

converting enzyme inhibitor use was significantly lower
among women than men for those with kidney disease. There
were no gender differences in the use of -blockers or calcium
channel blockers.
Forty-five percent of treated women achieved BP control,
whereas 51% of treated men achieved BP control (Table 4).
Among both genders, the proportions of BP control rates
decreased with age (P < 0.01) and non-Hispanic whites were
more likely to have their BP controlled compared to non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans (P < 0.05). Gender
differences in BP control rates were observed among older
age groups. Multivariable adjusted analyses indicated that BP
control rate was significantly lower among women than men,
specifically for older persons, non-Hispanic whites, and those
with coexisting medical conditions such as kidney disease,
stroke, or ischemic heart disease. Poor systolic BP control was
the major contribution to lower BP control rates observed in
treated women.
Additional multivariable adjusted regression analyses were
conducted to examine whether BP control rates differed among
men and women treated with the same antihypertensive drug
class. Among diuretic users, women were less likely than
men to have their BP controlled (44.2% vs. 54.6%, P = 0.002).
Among -blocker users, women were also less likely than men
to have their BP controlled (42.1% vs. 53.4%, P = 0.001). There
were no gender differences in BP control rates among calcium
channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or
angiotensin receptor blockers users.
Discussion
The findings of this study demonstrate that significant gender
disparities continue to exist in hypertension treatment and
control among the US hypertensive population. Consistent
with previous reports,7 women were more likely than men to
use antihypertensive medications, but treated women were
significantly less likely than men to achieve the recommended
goals of therapy even after adjusting for differences in age,
race/ethnicity, and comorbidities. When comparing men
and women of the same age, ethnicity, or medical

gender differences for antihypertensive use were less appar-
ent and appeared to be present only among the middle-aged
group and non-Hispanic blacks. However, gender differences
in the control of hypertension were most evident among
older age groups, non-Hispanic whites, and those with a his-
tory of cardiovascular disease. Lower control rates among the
elderly may partially contribute to the 
unfavorable outcomes
seen in women. Although the Framingham Heart Study orig-
inally observed a consistently greater number of coronary
heart disease events caused by hypertension in men com-
pared with women at any age, other studies have estimated
the attributable risk percent to be as great or greater in wom-
en.25 As more women than men have hypertension, optimal
BP control, particularly systolic BP control, may well result

in a greater number of hypertension-related events prevented
among women.
To achieve therapeutic goals for hypertension treatment,
national hypertension prescribing guidelines emphasize mul-
tidrug therapy and the use of a diuretic in the basic therapeu-
tic regimen.2 Our study found that less than one-third of the
hypertensive population were being treated with a diuretic
and less than half of treated persons had received more than
one drug. Women appeared to be less aggressively treated,
as evidenced by the lower use of three or more antihyper-
tensive drugs, although their overall use of antihypertensive
medication was higher compared to men. Owing to the cross-

sectional design of NHANES, we could not confirm whether
the less aggressive therapy was associated with poorer BP con-
trol among currently treated women. However, large clinical
trials have demonstrated that most patients with hypertension
can achieve and sustain adequate BP control only with the use
of multiple antihypertensive drugs.26,27
Utilization patterns for certain antihypertensive drug classes
were also clearly different by gender. Women were more
likely to use a diuretic compared to men. Seemingly, greater
use of diuretics among women did not confer more benefit
in terms of BP control. Instead, when examining individual
drug classes, BP control rates were significantly lower among
women than men treated with a diuretic or a -blocker even
after adjustment was made for differences in age, race/ethnic-
ity, and coexisting medical conditions. This, however, contrasts
with the results of long-term clinical trials of antihyperten-
sive treatment, which have not demonstrated clinically sig-
nificant gender differences in BP responses and outcomes.15,16
Fu and Levine28 suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors plus dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may
be a particularly effective combination in elderly women with
systolic hypertension based on Lipsitz's study.29 Gender differ-
ences in response to pharmacologic treatment of hypertension
may be incompletely understood. Further research appears
warranted to compare men and women of similar ages and
medical conditions directly to determine the precise levels of
reduction of cardiovascular outcomes with hypertension treat-
ment and control.
Hypertension, although typically asymptomatic, is a
major risk factor for stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart

disease. Hypertension is also commonly associated with dia-
betes and renal insufficiency. New clinical trials continue to
demonstrate different clinical outcomes of therapies tailored
to specific coexisting medical conditions. National guidelines
have incorporated these findings and recommended preferred
drug classes for treating hypertensive patients with different
diseases, specifically with diabetes, chronic kidney disease,
congestive heart failure, stroke, and ischemic heart disease.2
Our study found that antihypertensive prescription patterns
were generally compliant with current recommendations for
both men and women with diabetes, heart failure, or ischemic
heart disease.
BP control rates were poor among the US hypertensive
population, especially among older women and those with
coexisting medical conditions. The Department of Health
and Human Services has established a national goal to con-
trol high BP in at least 70% of treated hypertensive patients by
the year 2010.30 Clinical trials, including the Antihypertensive

Hypertension Treatment and Control
and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack trial
with 66% control rates31 and the controlled Onset Verapamil
Investigation of Cardiovascular Endpoint study with 70% con-
trol rates32 have shown that the relatively lower hypertension
control rates that currently prevail in the general US hyperten-
sive population can be substantially improved.
The primary strength of this study is the use of current
NHANES data with its nationally representative samples
and oversampling of key demographic subgroups such as the
elderly and racial/ethnic minorities. BP was measured by a
physician using a standardized approach. Prescription medica-
tion data were collected by trained interviewers, with the use of
an in-person, household interview protocol. Drug names were
recorded and verified by inspection of medication containers.
The observed gender differences in the prevalence of hyper-
tension treatment and control in our study were based on an
enhanced data collection protocol, incorporating BP question-
naire data, and prescription medication data. This allowed us
to identify all antihypertensive agents currently used by hyper-
tensive persons. Using the specific drug class data also allowed
us to examine drug utilization patterns and outcomes more
completely in terms of BP control as well as to illustrate how
the national guidelines for antihypertensive therapy are cur-
rently being applied to the US hypertensive population.
However, several potential limitations of our study should
be noted when interpreting our findings. First, while the aus-
cultatory method of BP measurement in NHANES is fully
consistent with national standards, NHANES measurements
are performed only at a single time point, rather than on two
separate occasions. It is therefore possible that some subjects
were misclassified with regard to their BP control status. This
potential problem was minimized to some extent by taking
the average of three separate measurements obtained under
the same standardized conditions. Second, NHANES is a
cross-
sectional study, and participants were asked to recall
medications used in the past month to minimize recall bias.
Thus, hypertensive subjects who used an antihypertensive
drug at any time before the 1-month recall period are classi-
fied as nonusers. The prevalence estimates could be affected
by the particular choice of a study recall period. In addition,
drug dosage and strength information are not collected in
NHANES. This limited our ability to address differences in
drug therapy responses across demographic subgroups and
clinical conditions. Third, 
antihypertensive medications may
be used for other indications. In our data, 91% of antihyper-
tensive users provided an affirmative answer to the question
"current taking prescribed medicine for hypertension". The
remaining 9% of antihypertensive users may have used the
drug for another indication.
The treatment of hypertension and the assurance of BP
control have been challenging and remain to some extent

unsatisfactory. Potential benefits of antihypertensive therapy
depend on both the efficacy of treatment and the underly-
ing risks for cardiovascular disease in the individual subject.
Although it is well demonstrated that age, race/ethnicity, and
coexisting medical conditions are important 
considerations
in BP control, gender is also a significant factor that needs to
be considered. The gender disparities in hypertension treat-
ment and control as evidenced by the current US national
data will likely stimulate further prospective studies on
whether the response to antihypertensive treatment is the
same or different between the sexes. Ultimately, it is possible
that men and women may require different antihypertensive
regimens due to differences in the progression and presenta-
tion of hypertension. Efforts are still needed to achieve thera-
peutic goals for the US hypertensive population, especially
for 
hypertensive women.
