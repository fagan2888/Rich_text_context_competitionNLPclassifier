Separate studies using data from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1976-1980 (NHANES II) have shown that blacks in the United States have higher blood lead levels than whites and that blood lead is positively related to blood pressure. Based on these reports, we examined data from NHANES II to determine the extent to which race differences in blood pressure were explained by elevated blood lead levels in blacks. Regression analyses, with race as an indicator variable, were used to estimate the contribution of blood lead to black-white differences in blood pressure. The overall effect of blood lead on race differences in blood pressure was small, reflecting, in part, the magnitude of race differences in blood lead and in the association of blood lead and blood pressure. Nevertheless, a pronounced and consistent effect of lead on race differences in blood pressure was found among the poor, particularly women. (Epidemiology 1991;2:348-352)

Black-white differences in blood pressure are well docu­ mented for populations in the United States:1--4 Even after adjusting for dietary, environmental, and genetic fac­ tors,5 7 the blood pressure of blacks remains substantially higher than that of whites. One possible explanation may be race differences in environmental exposures such as lead. Blacks are more likely than whites to be poor, to live in central cities, and to be employed in occupations conducive to lead exposure. In the lead subsample of the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1976-1980 (NHANES II) blacks had higher blood lead levels than whites. 8 9 Blood lead was also correlated with blood pressure in NHANES II.10 11 In this study, we used the data from NHANES II to assess the extent to which black-white differences in blood pressure are attributable to higher blood lead levels in blacks.

vices delivery, and disease prevalence among civilian, noninstitutionalized residents of the United States. Em­ phasis was placed on the inclusion of young chil-dren, low-income families, and the elderly. Questionnaire and examination components included demographic, medi­ cal, dental, anthropometric, and hematological measures on 20,322 persons aged 6 months to 74 years. Details of the survey design have been published elsewhere. 11
  The present analysis is based on information from persons 18-74 years of age who participated in a special lead subsample 11 and for whom there were valid observa­ tions on key variables including blood lead, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, age, weight, height, race, sex, and poverty income ratio. Because blood pressure rather than hypertensive status was the outcome of interest, treated hypertensives were excluded from the analysis. The study population consisted of 473 blacks (235 of whom were male and 238 female) and 3,627 whites (of whom 1,809 were male and 1,818 were female).
  The nonresponse rate for adults in the lead subsample was 35.7%, 9 in contrast to 27% for the full NHANES II sample. 11 Analyses of nonresponse for the lead subsample indicated no systematic bias by race, sex, income, or residence. 14 Missing blood lead values were more com­ mon for children less than 6 years of age. Among those selected and interviewed for the full survey, the largest nonresponse rate was found for the elderly, those living in the northeastern United States, residents of central cities, and individuals from smaller families. Response to the examination portion of the survey was higher among persons who had health problems that they wished to.

DEFINITION OF VARIABLES
Race was defined using self-reported ethnicity, with Hispanics excluded from the white population.  Body mass index was computed as (weight in kilograms)/ (height in meters1 ) . Age of the subject in years was recorded at the examination.
  Blood lead (µg/dl) concentrations were assessed from whole blood specimens obtained by venipuncture  and sent to the Clinical Chemistry Division, Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease  Control, where analyses were performed by atomic absorption spectrometry.11 Blood lead in micrograms per  deciliter was retained as a continuous variable in the analysis.
  Diastolic and systolic blood pressures (mm Hg) were determined by a standard mercury sphygmomanometer at the first and fifth phase Korotkoff sound on two separate occasions during the examination.11 The mean of the two seated blood pressure readings, one obtained at beginning and one at the end of the physical examination, was used in the analysis.
  Because socioeconomic status is often correlated with race, blood lead, and blood pressure, an indicator of economic resources was included. A poverty  income ratio, based on a ratio of total household income to a minimum subsistence income adjusted for family size, sex, and age of household head and farm/nonfarm residence, 12 was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. The values ranged from 0.04 to 8.8, with a poverty income ratio equal to or less than 1.0 indicating an income at or below the federal poverty standard. Two poverty income ratio strata ( :5; 1 and > 1) were created.

ST ATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Since NHANES II is a stratified probability sample, we used the program SUDAAN (Software for Survey Data Analysis) 15 in the analysis. We computed weighted means and proportions with associated standard errors adjusted for design effects from the DESCRIPT procedure. The REGRESS procedure was employed to calculate weighted regression coefficients and for estimating weighted stan­ dard errors based on the Taylor series linearization method. Sample weights consisted of inflation of the observation by the reciprocals of the sampling probabili­ ties, adjustment for nonresponse and post-stratification by age, sex, and race. We calculated two-sided 95% confidence intervals.
  Regression models were sex-specific and included age, body mass index, blood lead, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure as continuous variables. Race and poverty income ratio terms in the model were categorical. The primary measure of effect was the magnitude of the regression coefficient for race (representing the difference in mean blood pressure between blacks and whites adjusted for age and body mass). The precision of the regression coefficient was assessed from the 95% confi­ dence interval. We compared the regression coefficients for race with and without a blood lead term in the model to determine the portion of the race effect on blood pressure attributable to blood lead. To control for poten­ tial confounding by socioeconomic status, we  repeated the analysis within poverty income ratio strata.

Results
Black-white differences in age-adjusted blood pressure and blood lead levels are shown in Table 1. Blacks had higher mean blood pressures than whites, although the

differences were pronounced for females only (3.6 mm Hg, 95% CI: 1.85-5.41 for diastolic and 5.2 mm Hg, 95% Cl: 2.18-8.31 for systolic blood pressure). Blacks also had higher mean blood lead levels than whites (1.0 µg /dl, 95% Cl: 0.13-1.92 for females and 3.3 µg /dl, 95% Cl: 1.95-4.64 for males). In regression models with age and
body mass index as covariates, blood lead was a stronger predictor of diastolic blood pressure in males (13 = 0.13 mm Hg per µg/dl, 95% CI: 0.04-0.21) than in females
(13 = 0.08 mm Hg per µg/ dl, 95% CI: -0.80, 0.25).
Blood lead was not an important predictor of systolic blood pressure in either sex (13 = 0.08 mm Hg per µ.g/dl, 95% Cl: -0.03, 0.19 for males and 13 = 0.04 mm Hg per
µg / dl, 95% CI: -0.28, 0.20 for females) .
  Table 2 presents estimates of the contribution made by blood lead to explaining the race differences in blood pressure. In females, the coefficient for race was reduced from  1.57  mm  Hg  (95% CI: 0.08-3.06)  to 1.49  mm Hg
(95%  Cl:  -0.02,  3.03)  for  diastolic  blood  pressure and
increased from 2.31 (95% CI: -0.11, 4.73) to 2.36 (95% Cl: -0.05, 4.78) for systolic blood pressure after the addition of a blood lead term to the model. Both the percent and the magnitude of the absolute change attributable to higher blood lead levels in blacks were relatively small (5% or 0.08 mm Hg for diastolic and 2% or 0.05 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure).
  In males, the coefficient for race declined from 1.13 mm Hg (95% Cl: - 1.03, 3.30) to 0.73 mm Hg (95% Cl:
-  1.50, 2.96)  for diastolic and from 0.55 mm Hg (95% CI:
-  1.20,  2.30)  to 0.29  mm Hg (95% CI:  -  1.42,  2.00) for
systolic blood pressure. The relative reduction attribut­ able to blood lead was larger for males (35% and 47%, respectively) than for females, as was the absolute change in  the  regression  coefficient  for  race  (0.40  mm Hg and
0.26 mm Hg). However, given the small magnitude  of race differences in blood pres ure among males, these

results did not constitute an important effect of blood lead on the black-white difference in blood pressure.
  Because poverty is related to both race and blood pressure and may modify or confound associations be­ tween the two, the analyses were repeated within poverty income ratio categories. Among females (Table 3), black-white differences in blood pressure varied by poverty category: Race differences in blood pressure were most pronounced in the lowest poverty income ratio stratum. Within this stratum, the coefficients for race were of sufficient magnitude to suggest a meaningful effect of race on blood pressure (3.54 mm Hg, 95% CI: 0.55, 6.53 for diastolic and 3.37 mm Hg, 95% Cl: -0.73,
7.47 for systolic blood pressure). There was little evi­ dence, however, of important black-white differences in blood pressure among women in the  upper  poverty income category.
  Within the lowest poverty income ratio stratum, adjustment for higher blood lead levels in black women resulted in a reduction of the coefficient for race from 3.54 mm Hg to 2.56 mm Hg  (95% CI:  -0.12, 5.25)  for
diastolic and from 3.37 mm Hg to  2.50 mm Hg  (95% Cl:
-1.40, 6.40) for systolic blood pressure. Blood lead accounted for reductions of 0.98 mm Hg and  0.87  mm Hg, respectively, or a relative change of 28% and 26% in the black-white difference in blood pressure. Blood lead was of almost no consequence for explaining race differ­ ences in the upper poverty income ratio strata.
  Among males (Table 4), estimates  of race  differences in blood pressure showed little variation by socioeco­ nomic status. The effect of blood lead on black-white differences in blood pressure was most pronounced for diastolic blood pressure in the lower poverty income ratio category, with the regression coefficient for race declining from 0.82 mm Hg to 0.02 mm Hg (95% Cl: -3.11, 3.16). Nevertheless, given that the initial race difference was

less than l mm Hg, the percent reduction attributable to blood lead (98%) must be viewed with skepticism. Adjustment for blood lead actually increased the race difference in systolic blood pressure. The impact of blood lead on black-white differences in blood pressure within the upper poverty income ratio stratum was 0.32 mm Hg or 38% for diastolic and 0.20 mm Hg or 83% for systolic blood pressure. In none of these cases was the coefficient for model l (without a lead term) substantially different from model 2 (with a lead term) .

Discussion
Blood pressure differences between blacks and whites in the United States population have been explained only partially by known risk factors for hype rtension . Al­ though the association of race with blood lead and of blood lead with blood pressure provided a plausible mechanism for explaining, in part, race differences in blood pressure, the results of the current  study suggest that higher blood lead levels in blacks accounted for only a small portion of the overall black-white difference in

blood pressure for participants in the lead subsample of NHANES II. The absence of stronger empirical support for our theoretical model was, in part, a consequence of the relatively small magnitude of the blood lead/blood pressure association. For example , using diastolic blood pressure and based on the  regression coefficient for blood
lead  in  males  (    = 0.13) and  the 3.3 µg/dl  race differ­
ence in blood lead means for white and black  males shown in Table 1, adjustment for the higher mean blood lead levels in blacks would be expected to account for approximately 0.43 mm Hg of the race difference in blood pressure (the observed change was 0.40 mm Hg).
  Similarly, variations in the effect of blood lead on black-white differences in blood pressure by sex were explained by larger race differences in blood lead found among males (3.3 µg/dl) compared with females (l.O
µg/dl) and by sex differences in the blood lead/blood pressure association ( = 0 .13 for males and f3 = 0.08 for
females). Algebraically, the pattern of effects by poverty income category was a function of the same limitations . An increase in race differences for systolic blood pressure

in women (after adjustment for blood lead) was the result of an inverse association between blood lead and systolic blood pressure (13 = -0.04 for all women and 13 = -0.11
for women in the lowest poverty income ratio stratum). Two additional factors inherent in the design of
NHANES II may account for the absence of a more pronounced effect of blood lead in explaining race differences in blood pressure. First, blacks were not oversampled, and the number of blacks available for analysis was small, resulting in a loss of precision. Second, NHANES II was a cross-sectional survey, a design that has implications for the measurement of both exposure and outcome. The measurement of blood pressure and blood lead at one point in time may introduce substantial error that can produce an underestimate of the associa­ tion between blood lead and blood pressure.10 17 More­ over, blood lead is not an optimal indicator of body burden or chronicity of exposure to lead.18 19
  Despite the absence of a more pronounced effect of blood lead on race differences in blood pressure, a potentially important effect of lead was observed among women in the lowest poverty income ratio category. Variations in blood lead, the association of blood lead and blood pressure, and the contribution of blood lead to race differences in blood pressure by sex and poverty level may be a reflection of dietary deficiencies. One possible mechanism may be inadequate calcium in the diet,18 a factor that is related to the absorption of lead.
  A persistent difference in the health status of blacks and whites in the United States population is one of the critical issues confronting public health investigators today, particularly the identification of modifiable risk factors for hypertension. Exposure to lead appears to be more common among blacks, and the presence of higher blood lead levels in blacks compared with whites from NHANES II suggests that the health consequences of environmental exposures may be disproportionate by race, thereby adding another dimension to the health risk burden of blacks.
