Nasal Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus
and Methicillin-Resistant S aureus in
the United States, 2001-2002
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of invasive infections, yet most
assessments of prevalence are based on health care­based samples. We computed
population-based estimates of nasal carriage of S aureus and risk factors for car-
riage, as well as population-based estimates of nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant
S aureus (MRSA).
METHODS We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2001-2002 to estimate carriage of S aureus and MRSA for the non-
institutionalized US population including children and adults.
RESULTS An estimated 86.9 million persons (32.40% of the population) were colo-
nized with S aureus. The prevalence of MRSA among S aureus isolates was 2.58%,
for an estimated population carriage of MRSA of 0.84% or 2.2 million persons.
Among individuals with S aureus isolates, individuals aged 65 years or older had
the highest MRSA prevalence (8.28%). Among all the racial/ethnic groups studied,
Hispanics had the highest prevalence of colonization with S aureus but, when colo-
nized, were less likely to have MRSA.
CONCLUSIONS This first nationally representative assessment of carriage of
S aureus indicates that nearly one third of the population is currently colonized by
this organism. Although the prevalence of MRSA remains low, more than 2.2 mil-
lion people carry this resistant organism; thus, vigilance in promoting appropriate
microbial transmission protocols should remain a priority.

INTRODUCTION
Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common human pathogens and
is capable of causing a wide range of infections. Although primary
S aureus infections are not common, a great deal of the virulence from
this organism occurs through cross-infection by spread from patient to pa-
tient in hospitals and other institutional settings. In contrast, healthy indi-
viduals have a small risk of contracting an invasive infection caused by
S aureus, but they can be carriers of the organism.1 Because its primary habi-
tat is moist squamous epithelium of the anterior nares,2 most invasive
S aureus infections are assumed to arise from nasal carriage.3
The incidence of community-acquired and hospital-acquired S aureus infec-
tions has been rising with increasing emergence of drug-resistant strains called
methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA).4-8 MRSA is an established pathogen in
most health care facilities. Previously limited to hospitals, MRSA infections
have been increasingly reported in the community.8,9-14 A recent meta-analysis
of 27 studies of the prevalence of community-acquired-MRSA among hospital
patients that used clinical specimens, as opposed to surveillance cultures con-
ducted at the time of admission, yielded a prevalence of MRSA of 30.2%.15
The strains of MRSA associated with recent community outbreaks have

CARRIAGE OF S AUREUS AND MRSA
unique microbiologic and genetic properties that may
allow them to spread more easily or cause more skin dis-
ease than traditional hospital-based strains.16
Because many clinical infections arise from spread
from a healthy carrier, an understanding of the risk fac-
tors for carriage of S aureus is crucial to understanding
the potential for invasive infections and transmission
of MRSA; however, most surveillance of S aureus and
MRSA has focused on individuals with invasive infec-
tions rather than on an entire population.10-12,17,18 Focus-
ing on individuals with invasive infections provides a
good indication of severe disease but does not provide
an accurate assessment of the reservoir of S aureus and
potential for transmission.
A variety of studies have examined community
prevalence of nasal carriage of S aureus in diverse sub-
populations, such as adult outpatients, health care
workers, college students, and injection drug users.19-24
The prevalence of S aureus ranges from 20% to 45%,
with an estimate of MRSA colonization from 10 com-
munity surveillance studies of 1.3%.15 Few studies,
however, have focused on which individuals are most
likely to be colonized with S aureus and which are most
likely to specifically have MRSA. These are issues that
may be very useful to clinicians when trying to decide
the likelihood that a given patient has a staphylococcal
infection and, if so, whether antibiotic coverage should
be provided for resistant strains. We undertook this
population-based study to produce population-based
estimates of nasal carriage of S aureus and to identify
risk factors for carriage and to determine population-
based estimates of nasal carriage of MRSA.
METHODS
The data used for the present study come from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2001-2002. The NHANES 2001-2002 is a
nationally representative sample of the noninstitution-
alized US population. The NHANES design includes
an oversampling of minorities and allows determina-
tion of population estimates. More information on the
methods of the 2001-2002 survey including laboratory
assessment can be found elsewhere.25
Assessment of S aureus was conducted for the entire
sample; thus, all participants aged 1 year or older were
tested and were included in this study. The number of
individuals used in the unweighted sample was 9,622,
which represented a weighted population of 268,219,049.
Procedure
Assessment of S aureus
The procedure for processing the nasal cultures in the
NHANES 2001-2002 began with an inspection of the
nasal swabs for proper labeling and integrity. Nasal
swabs were refrigerated and shipped weekly to a con-
tract laboratory. Specimens collected from the nares
were plated on mannitol salt agar (MSA), a selective
medium for the isolation of S aureus. MSA plates were
incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Mannitol-ferment-
ing colonies (ie, those that were yellow or gold) were
selected from the MSA plates and subcultured to plates
with trypticase soy agar containing 5% sheep blood (ie,
blood agar plates [BAPs]) and incubated at 37°C over-
night. MSA plates with little or no growth were reincu-
bated at 37°C overnight, and plates with non­manni-
tol-fermenting growth were held at room temperature.
These plates were reexamined the next day, and any
yellow or gold colonies were subcultured to BAPs.
Overnight cultures on BAPs were first screened
using Staphaurex, a rapid latex kit for the identification
of S aureus (Remel, Lenexa, Kan). A tube coagulase test
using rabbit plasma with EDTA was then performed on
Staphaurex-negative isolates from BAPs with morphol-
ogy consistent with S aureus and on Staphaurex-positive
isolates with morphology inconsistent with S aureus
(ie, nonhemolytic). Staphaurex-positive isolates and
Staphaurex-negative, tube coagulase­positive isolates
were identified as S aureus and saved for further testing.
Staphaurex-positive, tube coagulase­negative isolates
were discarded.
Assessment of MRSA
S aureus isolates were screened for methicillin resistance
by the disk diffusion method of the National Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute. Overnight cultures
from BAPs were plated on Mueller-Hinton agar, and a
1-µg oxacillin disk was placed on the inoculated plate.
Zone diameters were measured and recorded after a
24-hour incubation at 37°C; the results were classified
as sensitive (13 mm), intermediate (11-12 mm), or
resistant (10 mm).
Potential Risk Factors
Several variables were investigated as potential charac-
teristics indicative of carriage of S aureus. These factors
included the common demographic variables of age, sex,
race/ethnicity, and place of birth. We also examined car-
riage of S aureus according to self-reported health status,
poverty-income ratio, outpatient health care use in the
past 12 months, hospitalization in the past, long-term
care admission in the past 12 months, use of antibiotics
in the past 30 days, self-report of physician diagnosis of
diabetes, self-report of physician diagnosis of asthma,
self-reported oral health, and current exposure to ciga-
rette smoke (operationalized as either being a current
smoker or living in a house with a current smoker).
Given the limited population carriage of MRSA, we
ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE  WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG  VOL. 4, NO. 2  MARCH/APRIL 2006

CARRIAGE OF S AUREUS AND MRSA
investigated a limited number of characteristics based on
whether the unweighted sample size was large enough
to make a reliable population estimate (ie, the standard
error was less than one third of the parameter estimate).
Analysis
The selection of variables was based on the ability
to use the entire population for our estimates. The
NHANES limits some questions to certain age-groups
(eg, adults) or other population subsets (eg, Hispanics).
Consequently, we investigated variables that were avail-
able for the entire sample.
We used SUDAAN software (Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for
the complex sample design used in the NHANES in
the analysis. Our analysis incorporated both the strati-
fication and clustering aspects of the sampling design.
The proper weighting procedures include adjustments
for the basic probability of selection and adjustments
for nonresponse. Because minorities were oversampled
and the sampling design was complex, we used sam-
pling weights provided by the NHANES to compute
population estimates based on weighted parameter
estimates and standard errors. Chi-square analyses were
used for bivariate comparisons. We also conducted a
logistic regression analysis of all variables with a bivari-
ate P value of <.10 and then removed variables that
were not significant at this level.
We initially attempted to compute the relationship of
several potential risk factors for carriage of S aureus and
MRSA but found that for some variables, there were too
few unweighted individuals in a cell to make a reliable
population estimate. Admission to a long-term care facil-
ity was one such variable and is therefore not presented.
RESULTS
Carriage of S aureus
We found that the prevalence of nasal carriage of
S aureus in the US population was 32.40% or 86,906,811
persons. Among adults aged 20 and older, nasal car-
riage of S aureus was present in 30.67%. Table 1 pro-
vides an indication of the population prevalence of
nasal carriage of S aureus based on demographic charac-
teristics; age, sex, race/ethnicity, and country of birth
were associated with carriage in this community sur-
veillance. In particular, it was noteworthy that non-His-
panic blacks were less likely than non-Hispanic whites
or Hispanics to be colonized by S aureus.
In addition to looking at demographic characteris-
tics, we also explored the relationship between clinical
characteristics and nasal carriage of S aureus (Table 2).
Among these characteristics, having asthma was posi-
tively related to carriage, whereas exposure to cigarette
smoke and recent use of antibiotics were negatively
associated with carriage.
To account for potential confounding
among the demographic and clinical char-
acteristics, we further analyzed the relation-
ship between the potential predictors with
a logistic regression model (Table 3). This
model shows that even when controlling
for the effect of the other characteristics
(eg, age, sex, race/ethnicity), the relation-
ships found in the bivariate analyses remain
significant.
Carriage of MRSA
We also looked at carriage of MRSA in the
same population. The prevalence of MRSA
among S aureus isolates was 2.58%. This
value corresponds to a total population car-
riage of MRSA of 0.84% or 2,239,888 per-
sons and a carriage of methicillin-susceptible
S aureus (MSSA) of 31.57% or 84,666,923
persons. Among adults aged 20 years or
older, the prevalence of carriage of MRSA
was 0.95%. Total population carriage of
MRSA was 0.67% for individuals aged 1 to
64 years and 2.16% for individuals aged 65
years or older.

CARRIAGE OF S AUREUS AND MRSA
isolates varied by age, race/ethnicity, and sex. Among
individuals with S aureus isolates, 2.03% of those aged
1 to 64 years were carriers of MRSA, compared with
8.28% of those aged 65 years or older (P = .01). Also
among individuals with S aureus isolates, 2.70% of
non-Hispanic whites carried MRSA, compared with
4.14% of non-Hispanic blacks and 0.79% of Hispanics
(P = .01). In addition, 4.14% of women with S aureus
isolates carried MRSA, compared with only 1.33% of
men (P = .01).
DISCUSSION
This study provides the first nationally representative
assessment of carriage of S aureus in the total US popu-
lation. The results suggest that nearly one third of the
population is currently colonized by S aureus. Although
the community carriage of MRSA is relatively low at
less than 1%, this figure translates to more than 2.2
million people in the United States carrying this resis-
tant organism.
Our prevalence results are similar to those of several
previous regional studies focusing on different sub-
groups of the population in the United States.21,24 In
regional estimates that were based on patients, however,
even though the patients did not have invasive infec-
tions, their MRSA prevalence tended to be substantially
higher than that in the more generally representative
sample of the NHANES 2001-2002.
Our study extends the previous knowledge in this
area by identifying several predictors of nasal S aureus
carriage. These predictors may help inform clinical
decision making when treating community-acquired
infections. First, teenagers and male individuals are more
likely to be carriers of S aureus. When clinicians encoun-
ter infections in these 2 groups, especially in body areas
where staphylococcal infections are common, such as
the skin, treatment should include an antibiotic that
is effective against S aureus. But while carriage is more
common in these groups, the prevalence of MRSA
remains low; therefore, clinicians should not be highly
suspicious of methicillin resistance in these populations
unless the infection is atypical, such as one occurring in
a body area that is uncommon for staphylococcal infec-
tion (eg, the lungs) or one that is rapidly advancing.
Our study also may be useful in that our findings
point out that relative to younger individuals, older
adults are less likely to be colonized with S aureus but,
when colonized, are more likely to have
MRSA strains. This finding suggests that
older adults with suspected staphylococ-
cal infections may need antibiotic coverage
against resistant strains. Because of the higher
rates of carriage of resistant organisms in this
medically vulnerable population, clinicians
may want to initiate vancomycin therapy ear-
lier in the course of a suspected S aureus infec-
tion in patients older than 65 years.
Whereas studies looking at the risk of
carriage of resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae
indicate that recent beta-lactam use increases
the rate of carriage of this organism, our
data indicate that recent use of antibiotics
is associated with a reduced risk of S aureus
nasal carriage.26 Unfortunately, because
the prevalence of MRSA was low and the
number of individuals using antibiotics was
small, we were not able to explore whether
antibiotic use is related to antibiotic resis-
tance in those who do carry S aureus. Among
individuals with an S aureus isolate who had
recently used antibiotics, 4.83% were colo-
nized by MRSA, while only 2.45% of those
who had not used antibiotics were colonized
by MRSA. This estimate, however, does not
meet criteria for reliability in this popula-
tion-based study because only 6 people had
used antibiotics recently and carried MRSA.

CARRIAGE OF S AUREUS AND MRSA
Finally, these data reflect a national sample. Local
rates of carriage and resistance may vary consider-
ably. Additionally, data for this study were collected in
2001-2002. Rapid changes in patterns of carriage and
resistance are possible. One recent study of children
in Nashville, Tenn, for example, showed an MRSA
colonization rate similar to that in our study (0.8%) in
2001, but a considerably higher rate when children of
the same age-group were sampled just 3 years later.27
Consequently, when clinicians are making therapeutic
decisions, they should monitor bacterial carriage rates
and resistance patterns for their own hospital and city,
as well as take into account the risk patterns found in
our study.
This study has several strengths. It provides the
first nationally representative community surveillance
estimates of S aureus and MRSA carriage for the United
States. By focusing on nasal carriage within an undif-
ferentiated sample ranging from small children to the
elderly, the study provides an estimate of the reservoir
of S aureus and MRSA that has not been available in
studies focusing on individuals in the health care sys-
tem or small regional samples.
Even with the aforementioned strengths, our study
has some limitations. Because of the small number of
individuals colonized with MRSA and the correspond-
ing inability to make reliable population estimates,
we were limited in our ability to identify risk factors
for community carriage of MRSA; thus, although it is
encouraging that the community prevalence of MRSA
is less than 1%, our ability to identify characteristics
of this group beyond age, race/ethnicity, and sex was
limited. A second limitation of the study was that it
was restricted to the noninstitutionalized population.
Although this population provides for the broadest
assessment of the entire population, carriage of S aureus
and MRSA may differ in other settings.
In conclusion, our study confirms the high preva-
lence of S aureus nasal colonization in the United States;
however, it also shows that the rate of MRSA carriage
remains low. Few demographic or clinical characteris-
tics are related to either S aureus carriage or, more spe-
cifically, MRSA carriage. Consequently, clinicians and
hospital infection control personnel cannot target spe-
cific populations who are at highest risk of transmitting
S aureus and should remain vigilant in using appropriate
protocols for minimizing microbial transmission.
