THERE IS STRONG AND CONSIS-
tent evidence from observa-
tional studies that physical
inactivity and poor cardiores-
piratory fitness (ie, fitness) are associ-
ated with higher morbidity and mor-
tality from all causes, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
cancer.1 United States population
reports describe an increasingly less
physically active society, with marked
downturns in reported physical activ-
ity during adolescence and young
adulthood.1-3 Physical activity has
been described in the population and
in relation to health outcomes; how-
ever, prior to the current National
Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES),4 data were not
available to quantify objectively deter-
mined cardiorespiratory fitness in the
US population.
A recently published large interna-
tional case-control study attributed
12.2% of myocardial infarction in the
world's population to physical inactiv-
ity.5 The extent to which physical
inactivity affects the risk of heart dis-
ease through its negative impact on
cardiorespiratory fitness, which is
associated with a high prevalence of
other CVD risk factors, is not known
at the population level. The objectives
of this report are to describe the
prevalence of low fitness in the US
population of adolescents and adults
younger than 50 years and to relate
low fitness to CVD risk factors in this
population.

Context Population surveys indicate that physical activity levels are low in the United
States. One consequence of inactivity, low cardiorespiratory fitness, is an established
risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, but the preva-
lence of cardiorespiratory fitness has not been quantified in representative US popu-
lation samples.
Objectives To describe the prevalence of low fitness in the US population aged 12
through 49 years and to relate low fitness to CVD risk factors in this population.
Design, Setting, and Participants Inception cohort study using data from the cross-
sectional nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
1999-2002. Participants were adolescents (aged 12-19 years; n=3110) and adults (aged
20-49 years; n=2205) free from previously diagnosed CVD who underwent submaxi-
mal graded exercise treadmill testing to achieve at least 75% to 90% of their age-
predicted maximum heart rate. Maximal oxygen consumption (V
 O2
max) was esti-
mated by measuring the heart rate response to reference levels of submaximal work.
Main Outcome Measures Low fitness defined using percentile cut points of es-
timated V
 O2
max from existing external referent populations; anthropometric and other
CVD risk factors measured according to standard methods.
Results Low fitness was identified in 33.6% of adolescents (approximately 7.5 mil-
lion US adolescents) and 13.9% of adults (approximately 8.5 million US adults); the
prevalence was similar in adolescent females (34.4%) and males (32.9%) (P=.40) but
was higher in adult females (16.2%) than in males (11.8%) (P=.03). Non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans were less fit than non-Hispanic whites. In all age-sex
groups, body mass index and waist circumference were inversely associated with fit-
ness; age- and race-adjusted odds ratios of overweight or obesity (body mass index
25) ranged from 2.1 to 3.7 (P.01 for all), comparing persons with low fitness with
those with moderate or high fitness. Total cholesterol levels and systolic blood pres-
sure were higher and levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower among
participants with low vs high fitness.
Conclusion Low fitness in adolescents and adults is common in the US population
and is associated with an increased prevalence of CVD risk factors.

METHODS
Population
The NHANES is a nationally repre-
sentative sample of the noninstitu-
tionalized civilian US population.
Race/ethnicity was self-reported, and
participants were identified using a
complex, stratified, multistage prob-
ability cluster design that over-
sampled non-Hispanic blacks, Mexi-
can Americans, persons aged 60 years
and older, and low-income individu-
als so that nationally representative
estimates of health could be generated
in these often understudied popula-
tion groups. Beginning in 1999,
NHANES became a continuous bian-
nual survey rather than the periodic
survey that it had been in the past.
This report includes survey years
1999-2000 and 2001-2002. A detailed
description of the study design and
sampling methodology for NHANES
is available.6,7
The overall response rate for those
who completed the household inter-
view was 81.9% (9965/12 160), and the
response rate for those examined in mo-
bile examination units was 76.3%
(9282/12 160). Participants aged 12
through 49 years without existing medi-
cal conditions, diagnosed CVD, physi-
cal limitations, or abnormal hemody-
namic parameters (ie, systolic blood
pressure 180 mm Hg, diastolic blood
pressure 100 mm Hg, or heart rate
100/min) were eligible to partici-
pate in the cardiovascular fitness com-
ponent of NHANES. Of the 8457 par-
ticipants in the age range for the
cardiovascular fitness examination,
5315 (3110 adolescents [12-19 years]
and 2205 adults [20-49 years]) com-
pleted the examination. Further de-
tails of the exclusion criteria are avail-
able.6,8 The NHANES protocol was
reviewed and approved by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics in-
stitutional review board. All partici-
pants provided written informed
consent at the time of the household in-
terview and the mobile clinic exami-
nation; additional parental consent was
required for adolescents younger than
18 years.
Fitness Estimation
The cardiovascular fitness component
of NHANES was implemented in 1999
toprovidenationallyrepresentativedata
on cardiovascular fitness and its rela-
tion to health conditions.8 Because it
was not feasible to conduct maximal ex-
ercise tests in a population sample this
size at multiple examination sites, a sub-
maximal treadmill exercise protocol
was used. The initial goal of the sub-
maximal test was to elicit 75% of the
age-predicted maximum heart rate
(220-age). During the course of data
collection the protocol was modified to
allow adolescents and adults to achieve
up to 90% and 85%, respectively, of
their age-predicted maximum heart
rate. To achieve this goal within the
allotted test time of 8 minutes (2-
minute warm-up and two 3-minute
stages), the protocol was designed to ad-
minister test protocols of varying dif-
ficulty (ie, speed, grade)8 to partici-
pants based on age, sex, body mass
index (BMI), and self-reported partici-
pation in physical activities.
All tests were supervised by trained
technicians. Participants walked or ran
on treadmills. Heart rate was mea-
sured at the end of warm-up and each
minute during recovery using an au-
tomated monitor with 4 electrodes con-
nected to the thorax and abdomen. At
the end of each stage, heart rate and
blood pressure were measured. Maxi-
mal oxygen consumption (V
 O2
max)
was estimated by measuring the heart
rate response to reference levels of sub-
maximal work. Higher V
 O2
max is in-
dicative of more favorable cardiores-
piratory fitness. Details of the protocols
and fitness calculation formulas are
available.8
Although submaximal exercise test-
ing is used clinically to diagnose CVD,
it is less than ideal for estimating high
fitness, as truly fit persons may not
have been asked to perform to their
highest level.9 Thus, we focused our
report on "low fitness" in the popula-
tion by using categorizations of low,
moderate, and high fitness based on
reference percentile cut points as rec-
ommended in the NHANES fitness
assessment manual.8 Low (20th per-
centile), moderate (20th-59th percen-
tiles), and high (60th percentile) fit-
ness was defined for adults based on
published data from the Aerobics Cen-
ter Longitudinal Study9,10 and for ado-
lescents based on the FITNESSGRAM
program.11,12
Other Measures
Data were collected at all study sites by
trained personnel according to stan-
dardized procedures.6 Sociodemo-
graphic information (ie, age, sex, race/
ethnicity, educational attainment,
personal and family medical history)
was collected during the household in-
terview. Physical examinations and
laboratory measurements were per-
formed in a mobile examination cen-
ter. Weight and height were measured
using standard methods and digitally
recorded. Body mass index was calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by
the square of height in meters. Waist
circumference was measured horizon-
tally at the uppermost border of the
ilium at the end of a normal expira-
tion. Blood pressure was measured 3
to 4 times (first measurement was
excluded) with participants in the
seated position using a mercury
sphygmomanometer.
Blood specimens were processed lo-
cally, then stored and shipped to cen-
tral laboratories for analysis. Levels of
total serum cholesterol and triglycer-
ides (measured in the morning exami-
nation session only) were measured en-
zymatically, levels of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were
measured using precipitation, and lev-
els of low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C) were calculated using the
Friedewald equation.13 Plasma glucose
levels (morning examination session
only) were processed using the refer-
ence analytic method.14,15 Glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c
) values were stan-
dardized to the method used in the Dia-
betesControlandComplicationsTrial.16
Overweight and obesity were identi-
fied in adults and adolescents by the
World Health Organization BMI crite-
rion.17 While participants with previ-

elevated resting blood pressure at the
time of examination were excluded
from participating in the fitness test,8
we identified previously undetected
hypertension in adults according to
modified guidelines (identification in
this survey was based on a single mea-
surement) from the Report of the Sev-
enth Joint National Committee.18
Hypertension in adolescents was iden-
tified as the 90th percentile of systolic
or diastolic blood pressure based on
age, sex, and height.19 Glucose level
was categorized according to cut
points defined by the 2004 American
Diabetes Association guidelines.20 The
metabolic syndrome was determined
in adults by National Cholesterol Edu-
cation Program Adult Treatment Panel

III guidelines21 in the subset of adults
with measured levels of glucose and
triglycerides. The metabolic syndrome
was identified in adolescents with 3 or
more of the following: triglycerides
level of 110 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) or
greater , HDL-C level of 40 mg/dL (1.0
mmol/L) or less (girls and boys), waist
circumference greater than or equal to
the sex-specific 90th percentile, fasting
glucose level greater than 100 mg/dL
(5.6 mmol/L), or hypertension as
defined above.19
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were stratified by age cat-
egory (adolescent and adult) and sex.
Participant characteristics were de-
scribedusingmeansandproportionsand
their95%confidenceintervals(CIs).The
age-adjustedestimatedpopulationpreva-
lence (and its 95% CI) of low fitness in
the sample was compared across ethnic-
ity using 2 tests. To evaluate the pat-
tern of association between fitness and
CVD risk factors, we categorized esti-
mated V
 O2
max into age- and sex-
specific deciles and plotted the age- and
race-adjusted means of each CVD risk
factor.Next,wecalculatedage-andrace-
adjusted means and 95% CIs by catego-
riesoffitnessandcomparedthelow-and
moderate-fitness categories with the
high-fitness category using F tests. Lo-
gistic regression modeling was used to
calculate odds ratios and 95% CIs for
each of the categorical risk factors (eg,
hypertension), comparing participants
with low fitness with those in the mod-
erate-orhigh-fitnesscategories.SASver-
sion 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC)
and SUDAAN version 9.0.1 (Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC) were used to conduct all
analyses; SUDAAN was used to ac-
count for the complex sampling design
and to apply sampling weights to pro-
duce national estimates.7 Statistical sig-
nificance was determined at P.05.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics (ie, lipid lev-
els, glycemia measures, and blood pres-
sure) of the sample were generally
within the normal reference ranges, and
the prevalence of newly identified hy-
pertension and diabetes was low
(TABLE 1). While the percentage of ado-
lescents reporting no vigorous or mod-
erate physical activity in the previous
30 days was below 15%, more than a
quarter of adult men and women re-
ported no activity. Among adults, the
mean BMI (26.8) indicated over-
weight, and nearly a fifth (19%) of
adults had the metabolic syndrome.
Nineteen percent (19.2%) of the sur-
veyedpopulation--anestimated16mil-
lion adolescents and adults younger
than 50 years--were in the low fitness
category, and 33.6% of adolescents (ap-
proximately 7.5 million US adoles-
cents) and 13.9% of adults (approxi-
mately 8.5 million US adults) had low
fitness. Among adolescents, the preva-
lence of low fitness was similar be-
tween females (34.4%) and males
(32.9%) (2=0.73; P=.40), but among
adults the prevalence of low fitness was
significantly higher in females (16.2%)
compared with males (11.8%) (2=5.2;
P=.03). FIGURE 1 shows the preva-

lence of low fitness by racial/ethnic
group. Low fitness was more preva-
lent across age groups and sex in blacks,
Mexican Americans, and those report-
ing "other" ethnicities than in non-
Hispanic whites.
FIGURE 2 displays the association be-
tween deciles of fitness estimated by
V
 O2
max and selected CVD risk factors
across age-sex groups. Anthropomet-
ric measures, ie, BMI and waist circum-
ference, demonstrated the most con-
sistent inverse associations with fitness.
Total cholesterol levels demonstrated
a graded inverse association with fit-
ness among adolescents, whereas
among adults a trend was less evident.
There was a graded positive associa-
tion between HDL-C levels and fitness
in adolescent and adult males, whereas
a similar pattern could not be ob-
served in females. Systolic blood pres-
sure was highest among adults and ado-
lescent males in the lowest fitness
category, but there was no association
in adolescent females. Although par-
ticipants in the lowest fitness decile had
correspondingly higher HbA1c
values
than those in the highest decile, asso-
ciation across deciles was not graded.
When fitness was categorized into 3
levels, participants across age-sex
groups with low fitness had overall
significantly higher mean BMIs and
waist circumferences than those with
high fitness (TABLE 2). Mean systolic
blood pressures and total cholesterol
levels showed a similar pattern by fit-
ness categories, but some trends did
not achieve statistical significance in
adult females (systolic blood pressure)
and adult males (total cholesterol).
Diastolic blood pressures were signifi-
cantly higher, while HDL-C levels
were significantly lower, among adults
with low vs high fitness. Comparable
patterns were evident for HDL-C lev-
els in adolescent males, but there was
no association in adolescent females.
The inverse associations between fit-
ness category and mean values of tri-
glycerides, glucose, and HbA1C
did not
universally achieve statistical signifi-
cance.
Adolescents and adults with low fit-
ness were 2 to 4 times more likely to be
overweight or obese than were partici-
pantsinthemoderateorhighfitnesscat-
egories(TABLE 3).Adolescentswhowere
less fit were more likely to have hyper-

drome, though the association with the

calsignificanceonlyinadolescentmales.
Newly identified hypertension, low
HDL-C levels, and hypercholesterol-
emia (among women only) were more
prevalent among adults with low vs
moderate or high fitness. Nonsignifi-
cant increases in prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome were observed among
the least-fit participants.
COMMENT
Findings from this report indicate that
low cardiorespiratory fitness affects ap-
proximately 1 out of 5 persons aged 12
through 49 years in the US popula-
tion--with a disproportionate impact
on adolescents, adult females, and non-
white minorities. The most striking in-
dication of the health burden of low fit-
ness in the US population is the strong
association among low fitness, obe-
sity, and CVD risk factors that is al-
ready present in adolescents and young
adults.
Who Is at Risk?
There is a high prevalence of low fit-
ness in adolescents and a strong corre-
lation between fitness and the presence
ofCVDriskfactors.Therelativelyhigher
prevalence of low fitness in adoles-
cents compared with adults in this re-
port may be due in part to study exclu-
sion criteria and the method for defining
low fitness. Adults with existing hyper-
tension or other clinical CVDs, which
are rare conditions in adolescents, did
not participate in the treadmill compo-
nent of the examination. This poten-
tially biased the sample of adults to-
ward being more fit. Alternatively,
because aerobic capacity declines with
age,22,23 the standards for defining ad-
equate fitness in adolescents are higher
than those for adults. The categories of
fitness used in this study were derived
from an external reference standard for
adolescents that was based on a smaller
select sample.11,12 Our data suggest that
few adolescents in an ethnically di-
verse representative US sample meet
these fitness expectations.
Although adolescents are not gener-
ally considered at risk for having clini-
cal CVD events in the short term, the
development of risk factors during ado-
lescence and young adulthood sets the
stage for heart disease in the middle and
older ages. Much of this evidence has
come from longitudinal studies such as
the Coronary Artery Risk Develop-
ment in Young Adulthood (CARDIA)
study,24 the Bogalusa Heart Study,25 the
Amsterdam Growth and Health Lon-
gitudinal Study (AGHLS),26 and the
Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns
Study.27 With the exception of CARDIA
and the AGHLS, these studies have not
investigated the relationship between
objectively determined fitness and de-
velopment of CVD risk factors, and only
the AGHLS measured fitness during
adolescence. While we are unable to re-
late adolescent fitness to the subse-
quent development of risk factors in this
cross-sectional survey, we can extrapo-
late from previous research to suggest
that a large segment of US youth who
are unfit and overweight are at risk for
negative cardiovascular consequences
as they age.
Low fitness is more prevalent among
females compared with males, and
among females, disparities by race/
ethnicity were apparent. Absolute lev-
els of cardiorespiratory fitness differ be-
tween females and males,22 but fitness
categorizations in this study were made
based on a sex-specific referent popu-
lation. Because physical activity, the
health behavior most strongly associ-
ated with fitness, is consistently lower
among women,2 our findings of lower
fitness among women are not surpris-
ing. Racial/ethnic differences in fit-
ness may also be explained by compar-
atively lower levels of activity in
nonwhites vs whites. Sex and racial/
ethnic differences in low fitness nearly
parallel the prevalence of obesity in the
population28 and may account for the
higher prevalence of overweight and
obesity in females compared with
males.29 The relatively higher preva-
lence of diabetes and hypertension in
racial/ethnic minorities may be attrib-
utable, in part, to poorer fitness and

groups. The notable exception that may
not be due to health behaviors is the
generally higher levels of HDL-C re-
ported among females and blacks.
Fitness and CVD
Numerous studies in adult men and
women10,30-36 report an association be-
tween low fitness and increased mor-
tality from cardiovascular and other
causes, including cancer.1,37,38 The re-
lationship between low fitness and car-
diovascular mortality in particular
is proposed to be mediated by the de-
velopment of CVD risk factors includ-
ing hypertension, diabetes, dyslipid-
emia, and the metabolic syndrome.24,39
Further, physical activity training in ef-
forts to improve fitness have been
shown to lower the risk of developing
risk factors, independent of changes in
weight.40
Obesity and overweight could be de-
scribed as the seminal public health
problem today.41 Body mass index and
waist circumference, which are esti-
mates of overall and central adiposity,
respectively, demonstrated the most
consistent association with fitness in
this study, as evidenced by the highest
mean values among the least-fit per-
sons that decreased in a nearly graded
fashion with increasing fitness. While
the correlation between low fitness and
other CVD risk factors was not as con-
sistent or dose-dependent, patterns in-
dicated a generally worse cardiovascu-
lar profile among the least-fit
participants. We attempted to relate low
fitness to the 10-year CVD risk using
the Framingham Risk Score among
adults, but scores were generally too
low in this relatively young popula-
tion sample selected to be at low risk.
Despite this, evidence of higher BMI,
total cholesterol level, and blood pres-
sure with lower fitness status suggests
that less fit persons are at risk for de-
veloping CVD if these deleterious pat-
terns persist.
Strengths and Limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first at-
tempt to characterize fitness, deter-
mined by objective treadmill testing, in
adolescents and adults at the popula-
tion level. However, these findings are
not without limitations. In this sample
of US adults, fitness was estimated from
a submaximal treadmill test proto-
col.42 In contrast to symptom-limited
maximal protocols with or without di-
rect measurement of oxygen consump-
tion, submaximal testing is inferior for
determining fitness because of its reli-
ance on prediction formulas.9,42 These
prediction formulas, which are based
on estimates of predicted maximum
heart rate that are often too low for
physically fit persons43 and may not ap-
ply to women,22 further compound the
risk of error. We were less confident in
the ability of the submaximal protocol
to accurately estimate "high" fitness.
Consequently, we chose not to focus on
the prevalence of this protective fac-
tor in the population and were unable
to quantify the level of fitness that cor-
related with favorable CVD risk factor
levels in the population. Thus, recom-
mendations for achieving specific lev-
els of fitness cannot be made based on
this report.
Although treadmill testing is gener-
ally considered a safe diagnostic test
when conducted in the presence of
trained medical personnel, there re-
mains a small risk of death during ex-
ercise. To balance the need for public
health information about fitness with
risks to the individual survey partici-
pants, we surveyed a population at very
low risk for complications from exer-
cise. Besides the obvious exclusion of
older adults who are at higher risk for
CVD, individuals with previously di-
agnosed hypertension were poten-
tially the largest additional group of
high-risk individuals who were not
tested. An important consequence of
this restriction is that we are unable to
make generalizations to the popula-
tion at greatest risk for CVD and the
complications of low fitness--ie, older
adults and individuals with existing risk
factors for CVD. As a result, these data
likely represent an underestimate of the
true prevalence of low fitness in the
population. There remains a paucity of
population-level research on the dis-
tribution of fitness in older persons and
persons with comorbid CVD.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite these limitations, this report in-
dicates that low fitness is a prevalent
and important public health problem
in the US population. The conse-
quences of declines in physical activ-
ity over time are now evident by the
large proportion of society with low lev-
els of fitness. The correlations we re-
port between low fitness and CVD risk
factors suggest a potential trend of in-
creasing morbidity and mortality from
chronicdiseases--thefirstsignofwhich
is the burgeoning obesity epidemic. His-
torical evidence from the campaign to
educate about the dangers of cigarette
smoking indicates that education ef-
forts, particularly among youth, can re-
tard and reverse these negative health
behaviors. Thus, it is plausible that a
similar education campaign about the
health benefits of physical activity to im-
prove cardiorespiratory fitness, in com-
bination with changes in health care
policy to make environments more con-
ducive to physical activity, could be-
gin to reverse this serious public health
problem.
