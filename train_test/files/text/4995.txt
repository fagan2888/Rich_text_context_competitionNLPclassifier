Introduction
The mass media hold a central role in the politics of many
contemporary democratic systems. Scholars have frequently
studied the political agenda-setting effect of the media
(Dearing and Rogers, 1996), and have found that the media
agenda systematically influences political agendas; an
increase in media attention for an issue leads to an increase in
political attention for the issue (see e.g. Edwards and Wood,
1999;VanNoijeetal.,2008;Walgraveetal.,2008).Politicians
thus adopt media issues in their political activities. However,
the media do not influence all political actors to the same
extent. Researchers investigating the conditionality of politi-
cal agenda setting--a research agenda proposed by Walgrave
and VanAelst (2006)--demonstrate that there are notable dif-
ferences in levels of media responsiveness, both between par-
ties, and between individual politicians within parties (Midtbø
et al., 2014). Some parties in parliament are more attuned to
the media agenda than other parties, and some MPs are more
often inspired by the media than other MPs.
While the variation between parties has been exten-
sively addressed and has been accounted for (see Green-
Pedersen and Stubager, 2010; Vliegenthart and Walgrave,
2011), the heterogeneity on the individual level has not
satisfactorily been explained. In particular, the relationship
between politicians' political motivations and their media
responsiveness has never been studied. This paper takes up
this question, asking: Do politicians' individual political
goals affect the degree to which their personal initiatives
are inspired by the media?
The paper contributes to the growing political agenda-set-
ting literature by (partly) explaining the micro level heteroge-
neity that existing scholarship has so far left unexplained.
Focusing on the individual level, and particularly on the
motives and goals of individual politicians, helps to better
define and understand the exact mechanism connecting the
media agenda with the political agenda. It is individuals, not
institutions or parties, who attend to information and issues.
By analyzing in detail who react to the media it can be better
understood why they do so and how the existing, consistent
macro level findings about the media's agenda setting power
are generated. Additionally, by focusing specifically on the
goals of individual politicians, the mechanistic approach that

Abstract
This paper addresses the micro level variation in media responsiveness by political elites. It hypothesizes that individual
political goals, in addition to party position, affect the extent to which MPs' parliamentary initiatives are inspired by
media cues. Regression analysis on data from a survey with Belgian national parliamentarians confirms this assumption.
Opposition MPs react more to the media than coalition MPs. Within parties, MPs who are focused on party political
goals display higher levels of media responsiveness than MPs who are not. The findings are explained by the differential
usefulness of news coverage for various political actors.

considers the mass media as a powerful actor in its own right
that imposes its agenda on politics is avoided. Instead, this
paper shows that individual politicians, and some more than
others, strategically employ the media to realize their goals.
Empirical analyses are based on data from a survey with
national Dutch-speaking MPs in Belgium. The results show
that politicians' individual political goals matter in addition
to their partisan environment. Concretely, the more an MP
is focused on party political goals, the higher the usefulness
of media coverage to realize his/her goals, and hence the
higher his/her media responsiveness.
Party level variation in media
responsiveness
In contemporary politics, the media play an important
agenda-setting role. This paper defines the media as the
`traditional' mass media, both in their old forms (newspa-
pers, television and radio) and in new derivatives (such as
websites from newspapers).1 Large-scale studies in differ-
ent countries have shown that the aggregate-level political
agenda is influenced by the media agenda (see e.g. Edwards
and Wood, 1999; Van Noije et al., 2008; Vliegenthart and
Walgrave, 2011). Those studies have addressed the varia-
tion in media responsiveness between parties. Most impor-
tantly, they have shown that opposition parties are more
inspired by media coverage than coalition parties (Green-
Pedersen and Stubager, 2010; Thesen, 2012; Vliegenthart
and Walgrave, 2011). The reason lies in the usefulness of
the information that the media provide. Political actors do
not passively respond to all kinds of information sources;
on the contrary, they actively follow those sources that pro-
vide information they can employ to realize their political
goals (Kingdon, 1973). The literature mentions various,
typical coverage characteristics that enhance the usability
of media coverage for opposition parties, while decreasing
it for coalition parties.
In terms of content, the mass media cover a large variety
of policy topics. Editors strive for a balanced composition,
trying to appeal to a large and diverse audience (Galtung
and Ruge, 1965). Consequently, media information is gen-
eral rather than specialized. Concerning style, the news
tends to be negative in tone (Galtung and Ruge, 1965),
especially news about politics (Farnsworth and Lichter,
2007; Kepplinger, 2002). Furthermore, media coverage
often focuses on conflict and controversy (De Vreese et al.,
2001; Shoemaker and Reese, 1996) and takes a `responsi-
bility attribution frame', indicating which political actors
are to blame or to reward for problems in society (Semetko
and Valkenburg, 2000). And finally, the media regularly
focus on the business of politics itself, rather than on sub-
stantive issues (Davis, 2009).
These particular characteristics of news coverage--gen-
eral, negative, conflict-rich, responsibility-attributing and
focused on the political game--make the coverage especially
useful for opposition parties. Their role in parliament is to
control the government, often via interpellations and parlia-
mentary questions.2 News coverage gives them potential
ammunition to attack the government (Walgrave and Van
Aelst, 2006). Coalition parties also engage in party politics,
but must be careful in this respect because attacking other
politicians, especially those from the government, could
threaten the stability of the coalition (De Winter and Dumont,
2006). Accordingly, they often avoid negative, conflict-rich
and responsibility-attributing media cues. This assumption is
confirmed by studies that examine the type of news that poli-
ticians react to most (see e.g. Thesen, 2012), and which find
that political actors react most to those messages that they can
use in the `attack and defense game' between parties (Green-
Pedersen and Stubager, 2010).
Individual level variation in media
responsiveness
Whereas differences in media responsiveness between par-
ties are well documented, research into individual level
variation is still in its infancy. Only two studies, which both
rely on elite surveys, specifically asked politicians about
the extent to which they personally act upon media cues in
their parliamentary work (see Midtbø et al., 2014;Walgrave,
2008). These studies explain micro level variation by look-
ing at structural features of MPs. Much like the studies of
aggregate political agenda setting, these micro level studies
find that opposition MPs are more responsive to the media
than coalition MPs are. Men, more than women, are
inspired by the mass media when taking parliamentary ini-
tiatives. Some authors think that women are less `media-
oriented' in general (Aalberg and Strömbäck, 2010).
Finally, the media are used less by older politicians, who
have built up networks and have other sources of informa-
tion beyond the media to nurture their activities (Midtbø
et al., 2014; Walgrave, 2008). Accordingly, this paper
includes party position (government/opposition), sex, and
age as control variables in its analysis.
This paper goes beyond the well-known structural fea-
tures of elites and argues that their different goals affect
their varying degrees of media responsiveness; inspired by
the literature stating that the usefulness of media coverage
is key to explain media responsiveness, this argument deals
with two individual goals that MPs may have: fighting the
party political competition and making public policy. These
goals are not exclusive; many politicians probably have
both foci simultaneously. This study measures the degree to
which each politician attributes importance to each of the
two goals.
In this paper, the MPs who focus mainly on the first
goal--engaging in party politics--are called 'party warri-
ors'. In a recent study about legislative roles, Van Vonno
(2012) describes these MPs as being in `interparty mode',
viewing politics as an ideological struggle between parties.
Sevenans et al. 3
Party warriors play the `attack and defense game'. They are
eager to publicly confront political rivals with their incom-
petence and mistakes. They are not proactively selective:
they 'wait and see what crises appear in the media and then
select their topic on this basis' (Searing, 1987: 442). The
average usefulness of media coverage for these MPs is
expected to be high. The media cover many issues from
which a party warrior can pick the one that is most suitable
in the competition. Features such as negativity, conflict and
responsibility attributions are useful for attacking other par-
ties. The news has become an important means for these
politicians to gauge the `political mood' (Sellers, 2009).
Those MPs who consider policy making to be their pri-
ority are different from `party warriors'. In line with Searing
(1987) and Van Vonno (2012), they are called `policy advo-
cates' here. These MPs take up governing-related tasks in
their parties; realizing policy goals is crucial to them. Since
developing bills and amendments is a technical and often
slow process, it is expected that the quick, general and the-
matically diverse nature of media coverage will be less
usable for these MPs. Davis, who interviewed British MPs
about the role of the media in their work, found indeed that
'although many MPs listed the news media as an important
source of information for their jobs, it was not usually
regarded as a source of information on specific policy mat-
ters' (Davis, 2007: 187). At first sight, however, this
assumption may seem to contradict the literature that policy
makers strategically use the news media to promote their
ideas and put their policy initiatives on the agenda of their
colleagues (Davis, 2009), or that policy makers consciously
launch initiatives when there is a lot of media attention for
the issue, because it creates a `window of opportunity' to
change existing policy (Kingdon, 1984; Yanovitzky, 2002).
But, in those instances, the media determine the timing of
an initiative taken by a policy maker, or they serve as a tool
for promotion, rather than as a source of inspiration.
Whereas party warriors can be more re-active--since stra-
tegic political discussions are volatile and can follow the
quick, daily rhythm of the news production--and can thus
be inspired by media coverage, the information-seeking
behavior of policy advocates is more long-term, pro-active,
and topic-focused. It is likely that policy advocates typi-
cally use other sources to determine their issue agenda.
Individual MPs probably do not define their political
goals fully autonomously. Their goals are determined by
their own preferences, but also by the broader context in
which they operate. It is likely that MPs from the opposi-
tion are generally more focused on party politics, while
MPs from the majority attribute greater importance to pol-
icy making. Parties may also impose a division of labor on
their MPs, assigning some the task to engage in war with
the other parties, while asking others to focus on policy.
The party and individual level are thus interwoven. This
paper claims that individuals adapt their media responsive
behavior contingent on their goals, their roles, and how
they are embedded in the partisan structure. Two hypothe-
ses are tested:
Hypothesis 1: The more an MP is focused on party polit-
ical goals, the more he or she will be responsive to the
media.
Hypothesis 2: The more an MP is focused on policy
making goals, the less he or she will be responsive to the
media.
Data and methods
These two hypotheses are tested using data from a survey
with Belgian, Dutch-speaking national MPs. The survey,
administered on iPads, is part of a series of face-to-face MP
interviews conducted by the authors and their collaborators
between June and November 2013. In total, 75 out of 87
MPs participated, leading to a response rate of 86%, which
is exceptionally high for elite research. Each interview took
approximately one hour and was scheduled beforehand.
Most interviews took place in the MP's office in Parliament
or in his/her hometown.
The dependent variable (media responsiveness) is based
on item (a) of the following survey question:
Of the initiatives you personally raised in Parliament last year
(e.g. bills, written and oral questions), roughly what percentage
were inspired by the following?
(a) The media;
(b) Interest and action groups;
(c) Meeting with individual citizens;
(d) Personal experience;
(e) Within the party (e.g. leadership, research center);
(f) Other.
The six items add up to 100% for each politician, so this
study's dependent variable is a proportional measure. Using
a proportion--and not an absolute number of initiatives
inspired by the media--allows MPs with different parlia-
mentary activity levels to be directly compared. Moreover,
it is believed that MPs are better able to estimate the rela-
tive importance of the media in their work, than they are
able to precisely count their media-based initiatives in
absolute terms, which would require they recall each indi-
vidual initiative. This measure is limited, as it does not take
the importance of the initiatives into account--some are
more consequential and require more resources than others.
However, the main interest here lies neither in the type of
initiative nor in its importance, but in the source of inspira-
tion, regardless of other factors.
The independent variables measuring MPs' political
goals are constructed based on measures in the same sur-
vey. The question used is the following:
4 Research and Politics 
What features of information make you take action (e.g. ask a
staff member to follow up on it, write a press release, and so
on)? Please indicate for the following features how much they
matter to you (on a scale from 0 to 10; 0 = does not matter at
all; 10 = matters very much):
(a) Can help me realize my policy goals;
(b) Can be used to generate negative attention for another
party.
Item (a) measures the extent to which an MP is focused
on policy making goals--this is believed to be straightfor-
ward indicator of the concept. Item (b) is used to assess the
degree to which an MP focuses on party political goals. It is
only a partial indicator. For instance, having party political
goals could also imply promoting an individual's own party.
Yet, it is believed that this study's indicator captures the
underlying concept of the party warrior reasonably well,
especially in the light of its theoretical conceptualization,
which characterizes party warriors primarily as MPs play-
ing the `attack and defense game'.
Based on the official website of the Belgian federal
Parliament3 three additional features of each MP were
retrieved: sex; age; and party membership (government/
opposition). Descriptive statistics of all variables can be
found in Table 1.
The data suggest that the media are, on average, the
most important source of inspiration for MPs; 23 percent of
their parliamentary initiatives are inspired by the media,
MPs say. As was expected, the share of initiatives inspired
by the media is larger for opposition MPs (26%) than for
coalition MPs (19%). The standard deviation of 11 in both
groups, however, shows that there are considerable differ-
ences between MPs within parties. There is a good deal of
individual level variation that this paper will try to account
for by looking at the goals of individual politicians.
As discussed above, it is anticipated that politicians'
goals are partly determined by the context in which they
operate, namely their party. A t-test shows that opposition
MPs focus slightly more on party politics than coalition
MPs, though not significantly so (t = -1.45; p = 0.15). The
relationship between being a coalition MP and focusing on
policy goals is not significant (t = -0.06; p = 0.95). It is clear
that party membership does not fully explain the individual
goals of politicians; there is plenty of variation within
parties.
To test the two hypotheses, a linear regression analysis
is performed. Some readers may consider this to be prob-
lematic--this study's dependent variable, media respon-
siveness, refers to percentages (always between 0 and 100),
while the predictions of a linear model could go beyond
those bounds. Therefore, an alternative model is also run
following the procedure for proportional dependent varia-
bles as suggested by Papke and Wooldridge (1993)4; the
results are highly similar and the predictions of the two
models are nearly identical. To simplify interpretation, this
paper reports the results of the simple linear regression
model below.
Results
The results of the analyses are shown in Table 2. In spite of
the small N (73), different variables appear to have a sig-
nificant effect on media responsiveness. Most interestingly,
MPs' goals matter. The importance an MP attributes to
`party political goals' has a positive and significant effect
on media responsiveness, corroborating H1: party warriors
use the media more often. The effect of `policy making
goals' goes in the expected direction, as well, but the nega-
tive coefficient is not significant (p = 0.65). H2 cannot be
confirmed.
With respect to the control variables, the effect of party
position is significant. Parliamentarians from opposition
parties are more responsive to media than MPs from the
majority. It is interesting to compare models 1 and 2 in this
respect. The coefficient of being in an opposition party
decreases when adding political goals, indicating that the
individual political goals partly soak up the effect of party
position, though not entirely. Individual goals matter on top
of party membership. Media responsiveness is significantly
higher for younger compared to older MPs. The third con-
trol variable (female) does not yield significant results;
male MPs are not more responsive to media than female
MPs. These results confirm what is already known about

variation in media responsiveness, but they add an impor-
tant new factor: politicians' individual political goals.
Adding goals to the model leads to a substantial increase
of the adjusted R², from 0.13 to 0.21. Political goals clearly
matter. They account for an additional part of the variation
that could not be explained by previous studies.
Figure 1 visualizes the size of the effect of the impor-
tance of party political goals on media responsiveness.
The predicted probabilities show that, keeping all other
variables in the model at their means, MPs who state that
generating negative attention for other parties is very
important (score for `Party political goals' is 10), base
almost twice as much of their parliamentary initiatives (31
percent vs. 17 percent) on the media compared to MPs
who attribute no importance at all to these party competi-
tion-related aspects of politics (score for `Party political
goals' is 0).
Conclusion and discussion
This paper investigated individual level variation in media
responsiveness by Belgian political elites. Descriptive anal-
yses showed that the media provide MPs with important
information--on average, 23 percent of all parliamentary
initiatives are inspired by the news--but that not all MPs
are equally reactive to media. Most importantly, politicians'
individual political goals matter. While MPs who focus
more on policy making goals do not use the media signifi-
cantly less, focusing on party politics does make MPs sub-
stantially more reactive to the media. Furthermore, as is
shown in previous studies, the context in which parliamen-
tarians operate is crucial as well. Opposition MPs are
inspired by the media more often than coalition MPs.
Individual goals matter on top of the party context.
The differential usefulness of media coverage for vari-
ous political actors explains this study's findings. On the
party level, the typically general, negative, conflict-rich
and responsibility-attributing media coverage is much more
relevant for opposition parties than for coalition parties. As
this paper has shown, this is not merely a consequence of
the underlying differences in individual goals. Opposition
party members--even those who are not focused on party
politics--are more reactive to media than government MPs.
An explanation could be that they have fewer alternative
sources for information. Compared with government MPs,
who for instance can get inside information from the cabi-
net and from `their' ministers, opposition members are
`information poor' and have to rely on the media to be
informed and to get inspired. Within parties, there is a divi-
sion of labor as well, leading to differences in media
responsiveness on the individual level. The more MPs con-
sider engaging in the party political game to be important,
the higher the usefulness of media coverage, and the higher
their media responsiveness.

6 Research and Politics 
In this study, it was assumed that motivations and posi-
tion are largely stable and affect MPs' information seeking
behavior, rather than vice versa (for a similar argument see
Searing, 1991). Technically speaking, however, this study's
cross-sectional design only demonstrates the co-occurrence
of the two phenomena and a causal relationship cannot be
demonstrated. It is interesting to reflect on the inverse
mechanism as well. It is possible that politicians partly
define their goals based on what the incoming media infor-
mation is suited for, and that their goals and their media
responsiveness reinforce each other; panel data--which are
difficult to collect since political elites are being dealt with
here--would be interesting to further investigate the exact
causal mechanism.
In any case, this study's findings have implications for
the relationship between media and politics; it was observed
that the party-political rather than the policy-making
aspects of politics are sensitive to agenda influences from
the mass media. This is good news for those who think
media influence on policy-making is undesirable because
policy decisions need to be based on a long-term vision
rather than on the news of the day. Alternatively, media
responsiveness in politicians might be viewed as a good
thing, as it ensures that the topics politicians care and
develop policies about are relevant to what happens in soci-
ety. It is seen that especially party warriors guarantee this
responsiveness vis-à-vis media priorities.
Using a survey design has limitations--though it cer-
tainly has advantages as well. The main drawback is the
possibility of misperception; politicians may not be able to
adequately assess the contribution of the media to their
political initiatives (Van Aelst and Walgrave, 2011). On the
other hand, perceptions are relevant; it is how politicians
perceive reality, and not reality itself, that structures politi-
cians' behavior (Maurer, 2011). A second disadvantage of
surveys is the influence of social desirability on the answers.
In this study, the item gauging MPs' use of information
`that can be used to generate negative attention for other
parties' may to a certain extent be prone to biased answers.
Despite these limitations, it is thought that this survey is an
appropriate method--it is simply impossible to directly
observe political goals, for instance--and produces valid
results.
The current study deals with one country only: Belgium.
Future research should examine whether the same results
are obtained elsewhere. Since this study's findings largely
resemble the results of Midtbø et al. (2014), who conducted
a similar study with MPs of fifteen European countries,
Belgium can likely be considered a representative case for
European countries. Media responsiveness appears to be, at
least partly, a function of individual politicians' goals.
