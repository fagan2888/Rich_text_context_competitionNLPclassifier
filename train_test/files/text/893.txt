Objective. To identify the proportion of community-dwelling elderly persons (70+) who could affect their eligibility for
Medicaidfinancingof a nursing home stay through the use of a trust and to quantify the prevalence and predictors of trusts.
Methods. State-specific Medicaid eligibility regulations were used to determine eligibility and to identify those who could
affect the same through the use of trusts. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify correlates of having a trust. Wave
1 of the Assets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (AHEAD) data base was used.
Results. Four in 10 elderly community dwellers could potentially qualify for Medicaid by using a trust; however, less than
10% had a trust. On average, wealthier persons had trusts. Avoidance of probate and controlling assets after death appear to be
stronger motivations for trust creation among the elderly than achieving Medicaid spend down.
Discussion. The use of trusts was not common, and motives other than spend down were more important for those with
trusts. Our results suggest little need for policy efforts to limit the use of trusts to achieve spend down.
MOST nursing home cost is bome in equal proportions by
the individual or family (private-pay), or by Medicaid
after an individual has become very poor (Murtaugh, Kemper,
Spillman, & Carlson, 1997; Norton & Newhouse, 1994). Private
long-term care insurance covers just 2% to 3% of all nursing
home expenditures in the United States, whereas Medicare fi-
nances 6% to 7% of the total (Murtaugh et al., 1997). This mix
of self-pay and public financing has led to concerns about equity
and quality among some but has been deemed "almost optimal
social insurance" by others (Pauly, 1990,1996).
Medicaid requires elderly persons to deplete virtually all
nonhousing wealth before financing nursing home care. The
conventional wisdom is that persons enter a nursing home as a
private-pay resident, spend virtually all of their nonhousing as-
sets on such care, and then qualify for Medicaid, a process
called spend down. However, empirical evidence indicates that
this occurs less frequently than is often alleged (Norton, 1995;
Sloan & Shayne, 1993).
Alternatively, elderly persons may take several actions to
qualify for Medicaid without first spending their assets on nurs-
ing home care. Such actions include transferring assets to chil-
dren and creating trusts to shelter assets in order to qualify for
Medicaid-financed nursing home care (Barreira, 1989; Bickel,
1994; Cook, 1996; Nemore, Regan, & Perkins, 1994; Palmer,
1994; Regan, 1995). Such actions are viewed by many as con-
trary to the Medicaid program's intent--to provide a safety net
for the needy. Thus, Medicaid financing of nursing home care
may create a moral hazard problem.
Recent public policy efforts, such as the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993, the Kennedy-Kassebaum
Act of 1996, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have made
the use of trusts for this purpose more difficult, and potentially
criminal (Bickel, 1994; Fish, 1996; Kienitz, 1997; Landsman &
Klein, 1997). These steps were motivated by the belief that such
actions to qualify for Medicaid, particularly the use of trusts,
were common (e.g., Landsman & Klein, 1997). However, the
frequency with which trusts are used to achieve spend down is
unknown. This study: (a) estimates the proportion of the com-
munity-dwelling elderly who could alter their Medicaid eligi-
bility through the use of a trust, (b) quantifies the prevalence of
trusts among the elderly, and (c) tests for the strength of several
competing motivations for trust creation.
Motivationsfor Creating Trusts
A trust is a device that transfers legal title of one's property
to another person (or to oneself) as trustee to hold for the bene-
fit of a beneficiary (Orman, 1997). From our review of both the
academic and nonacademic literature (American Association of
Retired Persons [AARP], 1996; Barreira, 1989; Bickel, 1994;
Budish, 1995; Cook, 1996; Espereti & Peterson, 1988; Espereti,
Peterson, Clement, & Strauss, 1996; Hughes & Klein, 1996;
Nemore, Regan, & Perkins, 1994; Palmer, 1994; Regan, 1995;
Rothberg, 1993), there are four primary motivations for the el-
derly to create a trust: (i) to spend down to Medicaid; (ii) to
minimize inheritance tax; (iii) to avoid probate, either for cost
or privacy concerns; and (iv) to control the distribution of assets
upon death or disability.
Medicaid.--Assets placed in certain trusts are not counted
against an individual for the purpose of qualifying for Medicaid
(Bickel, 1994; Hughes & Klein, 1996; Orman, 1997; Rothberg,
1993). A trust must have four features to allow it to provide
asset protection from Medicaid (Table 1).
In short, the trust must be irrevocable and the trustor must
permanently relinquish access to be principal in the trust,
although he or she may receive income from it.
Tax reduction.--Reduction of inheritance taxes is another
motive for trust creation. Until 1997, federal inheritance tax law
exempted the first $600,000 of an estate from inheritance tax;

Distribution ofAssets
Irrevocable means the terms cannot be
changed and the trustor loses complete con-
trol over the principal forever. A revocable
trust can be changed at any time and provides
no spend down benefit. Being irrevocable is a
necessary, although not sufficient, condition
for Medicaid spend down protection.
To achieve spend down protection, assets
must be placed in a trust well before the ap-
plication for Medicaid. The Omnibus
Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993 estab-
lished a federal requirement of a 60-month
"look back" period between the creation of a
trust and application for Medicaid. A trust
that is created and funded at death, or created
before death but not funded until death is not
Medicaid qualifying.
To achieve spend down protection, the trustee
may be neither the trustor nor their spouse;
loss of control over the principal by the
trustor must be complete. A trust may be
structured with the trustor or spouse also
serving as trustee. This provides no spend
down benefit but can provide tax and other
benefits.
A trust may provide income to the trustor dur-
ing his or her lifetime as stipulated in the cre-
ation of the trust. However, the trustor may
not have access to the principal contained in
the trust for it to be Medicaid qualifying.
Notes: Trustor is the person relinquishing control of assets and setting up the
trust. Trustee is the person who owns and controls the assets and administers
them as stipulated in creation of the trust. Beneficiary is the person for whom
the trust is designed to benefit.
the marginal tax rate ranged from 37% to 60% for estates
valued at $20 million and over (Espereti, et al., 1996). Thirty-
four states have no inheritance tax, and those that do vary in
both marginal rates and size of estate that is exempt from tax,
each of which typically varies according to whom is inheriting
assets (children, sibling, nonfamily member; Advisory Com-
mission on Intergovernmental Relations, 1995; Orman, 1997;
Ostberg, 1990). Trusts can double the federal and state exemp-
tions for inheritance taxes (Orman, 1997).
Avoiding probate.--Reasons for avoiding probate include
cost to the estate, delays in clearing probate, and public access
to probate court records (Dacey, 1993; Orman, 1997). The total
cost of probate varies among states, from a low of approxi-
mately $750 for a $350,000 estate in West Virginia to a high of
up to $10,000 in Connecticut, and it takes a minimum of 6
months in several states to 1.5 years in Indiana to complete the
process (Roha, 1997).
Direct expenditure.--A final competing motivation for trust
creation is the desire to control expenditure of one's assets. Trusts
are often used to bequeath wealth unequally to children, to give
to charitable organizations, and to control spending in the event
the person becomes disabled or is unable to make decisions
(Espereti, et al., 1996). A trust can remain in force after death.
METHODS
Approach.--This study tested for Medicaid moral hazard by
estimating whether being able to qualify for Medicaid was an
important reason for creating a trust in a national community-
dwelling sample of elderly persons, while controlling for other
motivations. If policymakers' concern that Medicaid moral haz-
ard induces elderly persons to create trusts is correct, then we
expect to find that individual characteristics related to needing
nursing home care would be positively correlated with having a
trust.
First, we estimated the number of elderly persons living in
the community who would potentially benefit from creating a
Medicaid-qualifying trust. Next, we estimated a model to test
the competing motives for trust creation on the probability of
having a trust. Finally, to place our investigation of trusts in
context of other spend down mechanisms, we identified those
elderly persons who achieved Medicaid eligibility by giving as-
sets directly to children, over a 2-year period.
Data.--We used the Asset and Health Dynamics of the
Oldest Old (AHEAD) database, Wave 1. AHEAD was designed
for research on changes in assets and wealth, and their interrela-
tionship with health among the elderly population after their
main working years have ended (Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, &
Wallace, 1997). AHEAD has a panel design with respondents
between the ages of 70 and 90 years. Data collection for Wave 1
began in October 1993 and continued through May 1994. Eight
thousand two hundred twenty-four respondents, 2,560 of whom
were over 85 years of age, were included in Wave 1. Blacks,
Hispanics, and residents of the state of Florida were oversam-
pled.
Our multivariate analysis was conducted at the household level.
Our sample included 5,767 of the 6,014 households who received
the full battery of questions. There were 2,072 couple households
(4,144 individuals) and 3,617 single households. The primary rea-
son for missing values was the lack of a state identifier for house-
holds, which prevented us from assessing Medicaid eligibility and
several other state-specific covariates. We compared those house-
holds missing state identifiers with those having them. They were
similar on basic demographic variables. We presented our data at
the individual level (N= 7,761; 4,144 persons from 2,072 couples,
and 3,617 single households) to illustrate the distribution of total
respondents according to Medicaid spend down status (Figure 1).
We analyzed the existence of a trust for couples and singles
separately. In the case of couples, characteristics of both the
male and female members of the household were included as
explanatory variables.
Dependent variable.--The dependent variable was having a
trust in Wave 1, as reported by the primary respondent of a
household, whether a single or a couple.
Empirical specification.--We included explanatory variables
for the four motivations for establishing trusts, demographic
characteristics of respondents, and household wealth.

Figure 1. Medicaid spend down status for community-dwelling elderly persons, Wave 1 AHEAD (7,761 individuals; 2,072 couples; 3,617 singles).
To measure spend down motivation, we included three binary
variables that determined potential to use a trust to become
Medicaid eligible. The first identified those households never el-
igible based on income, the second those with assets greater
than a 5-year stay in a nursing home, and, finally, those for
whom spend down would occur in less than 5 years, but who
were not eligible for Medicaid at the time of the survey. The ref-
erence group was eligible households in the community based
on income, assets, and spousal impoverishment provisions at the
time of the survey. Only 8% of the elderly entering a nursing
home remain longer than 5 years (Murtaugh et al., 1997). We
used 1994 Medicaid rules and 1992 average daily nursing home
price, inflated to 1994 dollars using the medical Consumer Price
Index. Persons never eligible based on income were those with
incomes above a fixed state income limit, or those with incomes
greater than the average nursing home price in states with no in-
come limit but that apply medical expenses against income for
purposes of establishing eligibility for Medicaid.
Personal characteristics relating to the probability of needing
nursing home care were measured separately for both the male
and female member of a couple. The first was each respon-
dent's estimate of the probability of needing nursing home care
within 5 years, and the second was the self-assessed probability
of living for at least 10 years. We included a binary variable
equal to 1 if a respondent had a missing value for either subjec-
tive assessment question, because of a substantial number of
missing values for these two variables. Among couples, 552
men (26.6%) and 469 women (22.6%) had missing values on at
least one of these variables, as did 1,283 singles (35.5%).
We also used number of limitations in activities of daily liv-
ing, measured on a scale from 0 to 6. Cognitive status was a bi-
nary variable, with 1 when respondents answered 10 or more
items of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status correctly.
Finally, we included a binary variable for self-assessed health
status equal to 1 when respondents reported their health was
"good" to "excellent" relative to others their age, with "fair"
and "poor" the omitted reference group, a measure shown to
predict survival (Dasbach, Klein, Klein, & Moss, 1994) and use
of personal health services (Pope, 1988). However, the effect of
health status on long-term care coverage is ambiguous (Kumar,
Cohen, Bishop, & Wallack, 1995).
To measure tax motivations for creating trusts, we included
TRUSTSAND MEDICAID MORAL HAZARD S197
variables for the combined federal and state inheritance tax rate
given respondent net worth and number of children. We con-
trolled for number of children since persons with more may
have a higher bequest motive and are thus more likely to try to
avoid inheritance taxes.
To measure the motive for avoiding probate, we created binary
variables for whether a state had stringent lawyer fee regulation
for probate, whether a respondent's assets would qualify for an
affidavit estate transfer in the respondent's state (which generally
does not allow for transfer of a house), and whether a respon-
dent's assets would qualify for a summary probate procedure.
The dollar value for the size of estate qualifying for a summary
probate procedure ranged from $3,000 in Alabama to $100,000
in Nevada in 1994 (Hughes & Klein, 1996). To the extent that
administrative costs of probate are lower because of summary
probate or affidavit transfer, fewer elderly persons should want to
create trusts to circumvent probate. However, to the extent that
the state statutes are a binding constraint on lawyers' fees,
lawyers may push trusts for which there is no fee regulation.
For the motive of controlling one's assets, we included bi-
nary variables for whether the household donated at least $500
in the past year to charity, whether the will provided for un-
equal shares of the bequest for children (we used the will of
men for couples), and whether the will provided for charity.
Persons with charitable motives and with wills that benefited
children unequally would be expected to be more likely to have
a trust to control assets.
We included demographic characteristics for race (White),
education (less than high school), age, and whether the inter-
view was completed by a proxy. The analysis was run sepa-
rately for married couples and singles. For singles, a binary
variable equal to 1 was included if they were widowed, as was
a control for gender (female =1).
Finally, we included variables for household net worth other
than primary housing wealth, net worth in primary place of res-
idence, and nonearnings household income in the previous year.
A binary variable was also included for missing income in the
past year. We specified wealth in this way because Medicaid
excludes housing wealth from the asset screen for eligibility if
there is a positive probability that the nursing home resident
will return there (see e.g., Budish, 1995).
Estimation.--Mulitvariate logistic regression was used to es-
timate the probability of a household reporting a trust in Wave 1
AHEAD. Robust estimates of standard errors were obtained
using the Huber-White sandwich estimator procedure (STATA
Corporation, 1997). Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square and ROC
statistics were used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the models.
RESULTS
Approximately 40% of the respondents could potentially
alter their Medicaid status by creating a trust (Figure 1). A
roughly equal proportion were eligible for Medicaid financing
of a nursing home stay while in the community, and 1 in 5
could not alter their Medicaid status through the use of a trust
because their nonearning income was too large.
Four hundred forty-four of the 5,689 households (7.8%) re-
ported a trust in Wave 1, with 6.3% of single households and
10.4% of couples reporting a trust. We compared the characteris-
tics of respondents with and without a trust at Wave 1, for both
the single and couple sample (Table 2). Most of the mean values
were significantly different. Those with a trust were wealthier,
faced a higher combined inheritance tax rate, were more edu-
cated, were more likely to be White, and were more likely to have
a will that leaves money to a charity and which was designed to
benefit children unequally, contingent upon having children.
Among couples, male and female values of individualized ex-
planatory variables were generally similar, both in terms of mag-
nitude and statistical significance, when comparing those with and
without a trust. However, in the case of expectations of needing
nursing home care within 5 years, and of living at least 10 years,
this pattern did not hold. Men in couples with a trust were signifi-
cantly more likely than those without a trust to believe they would
move to a nursing home within 5 years, but women did not differ
in this respect. Women in couples with a trust had a higher expec-
tation of survival, but there was no difference among men.
Having more assets to protect were the strongest predictors
of having a trust in multivariate models (Table 3). Couples with
nonhouse assets equal to more than a five-year nursing home
stay were the most likely to report a trust (adjusted odds ratio
5.58 [95% CI 2.40,12.98]). However, those couples who could
never qualify for Medicaid because of their income were nearly
as likely to have a trust (5.06 [95% CI 2.32,11.07]). A weaker,
but statistically significant effect was detected for couples
whose assets were equal to at least 1 day in a nursing home, but
less than 5 years (2.27 [95% CI 1.05^.91]). All comparisons
were against couples that were eligible for Medicaid while in
the community at the time of the survey. For singles, relation-
ships were similar, but weaker.
When male members of a couple viewed themselves as more
likely to live at least 10 more years, the household was less
likely to have a trust (0.54 [95% CI 0.31,0.94]), whereas the
effect of the same variable for women had the opposite effect
(1.71 [95% CI 0.99, 2.96]) and was nearly significant at con-
ventional levels (P = 0.053). Notably, the subjective probability
of needing nursing home care within 5 years for the male or fe-
male did not have a significant effect on the existence of a trust,
for couples or singles.
Female members of a couple who reported their health status
was the same or better than others their age were about 50%
more likely to be in a couple with a trust (1.57 [95% CI 1.00,
2.46]). The point estimate for male self-assessed health status
was similar (1.49) but was less precisely measured (P = 0.055).
None of these variables were significant predictors of having a
trust among singles.
We found that some persons set up trusts to avoid probate.
Couples living in states with stringent probate lawyer fee regu-
lations were about two thirds more likely to report having a
trust relative to those in states without strict controls, suggesting
lawyer created demand for trusts (1.64 [95% CI 1.18,2.28]).
Also, control of assets was a motive. Couples who reported a
provision in the male's will that benefited a charity were more
likely to report a trust (2.36 [95% CI 1.47-3.77]), and singles
whose will benefited their children unequally were more likely
to have a trust (1.60 [95% CI 1.15,2.23]).
Finally, Whites were much more likely to have trusts than
others even after controlling for income, wealth, and education
(4.66 [95% CI 1.34,16.26] for couples and 3.49 [95% CI
1.46,8.53] for singles). The effect of being one year older was
similar for men in couples and for singles (approximately a 5%

aHosmer-Lemeshow chi-square was used because Pearson chi-square showed that the number of covariate patterns was nearly as large as the number of observa-
tions. Hosmer-Lemeshow was calculated after grouping the predicted probability of having a trust into 10 groups; lack of statistical significance signifies good fit.

increase in likelihood of having a trust), but age of the woman in
a couple was not statistically significant. For singles, both mea-
sures of wealth and yearly income were significant predictors of
having a trust, with persons with higher wealth being more
likely to have a trust. For couples, there was no independent
wealth effect once the couple's spend down status was assessed.
We conducted sensitivity analysis of the way in which income
and wealth were entered into the model, specifying the variables
as quartiles. The results for couples were not sensitive to the func-
tional form of these variables, but among singles, when wealth
and income were entered as quartiles, the variables representing
time to spend down were not statistically significant.
There are other ways in which an individual may purposefully
achieve spend down to Medicaid. Between Waves 1 and 2, a 2-
year time interval, 113 respondents achieved Medicaid eligibility
after giving a substantial gift (in terms of proportion of their
wealth) to children. Twelve of these persons reported a subjective
probability of needing nursing home care within 5 years of 0.5 or
better. These twelve cases combined potential spend down moti-
vation with an act that achieved spend down eligibility. Only 1 of
the 113 persons gave away assets that were equal to more man a
5-year stay in a nursing home to achieve spend down.
DISCUSSION
We do not find much evidence that Medicaid spend down is
commonly achieved by the use of a trust. Trusts were rare among
community-dwelling elderly persons--less than one in 10 had
them--in spite of several motivations for their creation and a cot-
tage industry that touts the various benefits of trusts for the elderly
person (Dacey, 1993; Hughes & Klein, 1996; Orman, 1997). By
comparison, 1 in 100 members of the total sample gave assets to
their children between Waves 1 and 2 that qualified them for
Medicaid financing of a nursing home stay. Comparison of wealth
distributions with the Health and Retirement Study (respondents
51-61) rule out prior inter vivos transfers before persons reach the
age of our sample (70+) (Smith, 1997). Many elderly persons
(roughly 40%) were poor enough to qualify for Medicaid financ-
ing of a nursing home stay while living in the community.
While several of our findings are consistent with the hypoth-
esized Medicaid spend down motivation, it appears that trust
creation is generally most strongly associated with high wealth.
For example, our finding that those with assets equal to more
than a 5-year nursing home stay are more likely to have a trust
could be construed as support for a hypothesis that trusts are
used by the wealthy to achieve spend down. However, having
income which would preclude ever spending down, regardless
of asset level, was also predictive of having a trust, although
such a trust could never achieve spend down. Finding that level
of wealth is related to having a trust is in line with other re-
search on a less restricted age group (Wolff, 1994). On balance,
we also found evidence supporting trust creation for the pur-
pose of avoiding probate and preserving control of assets after
death.
Several differences between men and women and between cou-
ples and singles provide some evidence regarding trust creation be-
havior. Couples in which the man expected to live longer were less
likely to have a trust, the opposite effect being true for women.
This suggests couples are more likely to plan for the future with a
trust when the woman is seen as likely to live relatively long and
face the prospect of being widowed for a longer time. Men who
expect to live longer do not appear to see a need for trust creation,
suggesting they believe they will be aroundto"take care ofthings."
However, when the man was more disabled, net of other factors,
the couple was more likely to have a trust, possibly anticipating the
need for long-term care (theADL limitation variable may be pick-
ing up some of this type of effect for men with missing nursing
home expectation information, which was substantial).
The decision of singles to create a trust is not affected by
longevity expectations, probably showing they do not have to
worry about widowing a spouse. However, single trust creation
does appear to be related to a person's history of making charita-
ble donations, and of creating a will to benefit children un-
equally, suggesting past experience with detailed financial/estate
planning (having a will specifying unequal bequest to children).
Singles are also more likely to create a trust given a higher ex-
pectation of moving to a nursing home in the near term. The
most likely motive given other findings is that singles are mov-
ing to maximize their estate available, either to children, or to
charitable concerns, whereas among couples, the spouse, not the
children, is foremost in motivating estate planning via a trust.
Our research is subject to several important limitations. First,
we analyzed the existence of a trust in a cross-section. In pre-
liminary analysis, we looked at trust creation and found it to be
extremely rare between Waves 1 and 2 of AHEAD (a 2-year
period). The next several waves will allow for a more complete
follow-up to identify those respondents that ultimately enter
nursing homes, allowing for a link between estate planning ac-
tivities, family structure, perceptions of need, and actual behav-
ior. Second, all trusts do not achieve Medicaid spend down pro-
tection. The AHEAD data in Wave 1 did not ascertain whether
a trust was irrevocable, a necessary but not sufficient condition
for spend down protection. In Wave 2, such information was
ascertained, but preliminary attempts to link Waves 1 and 2 to
infer the type of trust present in Wave 1 proved to be too inac-
curate. Further, the proportion of trusts in Wave 2 that were ir-
revocable was so small as to make multivariate analysis im-
practical, as well as to suggest that virtually no one had a trust
that could achieve spend down. Third, it is possible that elderly
persons who have created trusts for the purpose of achieving
spend down protection may be understandably unwilling to
admit this. However, the question regarding existence of a trust
was not asked in the context of Medicaid estate planning, less-
ening the risk of purposeful nonreporting.
The study sample consisted of elderly persons 70 years of age
and older who lived in the community. A community sample is
best to investigate trust creation to spend down because a nurs-
ing home-based sample would not be able to observe the for-
ward-thinking actions necessary for an elderly person to qualify
themselves for Medicaid. Even before the provisions of OBRA
1993 took effect (which expanded the look back for trusts to 60
months), the vast majority of the group most likely to benefit
from the use of trusts to spend down did not have one.
Our results suggest that there is limited rationale for further
public policy efforts designed to limit the use of trusts to
achieve spend down, because such behavior is rare. However,
the baby boom generation has accumulated large amounts of
wealth over the past three decades, particularly in relatively liq-
uid forms of retirement savings, such as 40IK or 403B ac-
counts, as opposed to nonbequeathable pensions. This means
that the potential motivation of sheltering such assets from use
TRUSTSAND MEDICAID MORAL HAZARD S201
to pay nursing home costs may increase. Monitoring future use
of trusts for purposeful spend down may be necessary to ensure
that the purpose of the Medicaid program, to provide a safety
net for the poor, is not circumvented.
