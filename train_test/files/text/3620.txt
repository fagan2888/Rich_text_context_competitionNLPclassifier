Journal of Workplace Rights
Introduction
Over the last decades, studies have highlighted the increas-
ing conflict between work and family for many workers
(Duxbury, Higgins, & Lee, 1993, 1994; Galinsky, Stacy, &
James, 2001; Nelson & Quick, 1985; Tremblay, 2012a,
2012b, 2012c), but much work has centered on professionals
and managers (cf. Tremblay & Genin, 2010; Tremblay &
Mascova, 2013), and little has been done on lower level
workers or workers with difficult working conditions. This is
what brought us to look into a group of workers that has less
favorable working conditions to see to what extent they suf-
fer from work­family conflict.
The work­family or work­life conflict is generally ana-
lyzed in reference to the lack of time faced by parents, which is
the result of a conflict between the time allowed to working and
the time that they manage to have for their family (work­fam-
ily conflict) and for other activities--political, social, cultural,
leisure (work­life conflict more generally). These various
activities (social, cultural, leisure, political, etc.) are often put
aside; parents sometimes procrastinate and end up completely
excluding them from their lives (Tremblay, 2012a, 2012c). In
addition, some research indicates that a large proportion of par-
ents who are in employment feel stressed because they are not
always able to balance their work and family responsibilities
and tasks (Duxbury et al., 1993, 1994; Galinsky et al., 2001;
Nelson & Quick, 1985). Also, many forms of employment
(temporary, independent, on-call, casual) and schedules (part-
time, split, or broken schedules, etc.) increase the difficulties
people have in trying to articulate work and family, as well as a
career that meets their wishes (Tremblay, 2004, 2005).
In Canada, as in all industrialized societies, the transforma-
tion of the labor market and the family, as well as demographic
changes, in particular, an aging society, causes difficulties in

Work­Life Integration and Workplace
Rights for Domestic Workers in Support
to Elderly Persons: A Real Challenge in a
Complex Working Environment!
Diane-Gabrielle Tremblay1 and Ilda Ilse Ilama2
Abstract
Our article shows that there is a real challenge in balancing work and family for employees working in support services
in domestic work for elderly persons; their workplace rights on this issue are quite limited, and they depend largely on
managers' understanding and support. Given their difficult working conditions, these workers actually find quite a challenge
in trying to reconcile work and family. Our article is based on a qualitative research mobilizing 33 semi-structured interviews
with employees of the home care sector in the field of the social economy mainly but also in the private sector. We first
present the concept of work­family and personal life, then the area of home care and domestic work for the elderly. Then,
we present the particular challenges observed in reconciling work and family life, where possible by comparing men and
women. The results highlight two major sources of differentiation: age and single parenthood. Those who are older highlight
the fact that children have grown up, and they have (finally) some time for themselves, even if their working conditions are
difficult (broken schedules, etc.). In contrast, single women live a much more difficult situation concerning work­family, partly
because of the lack of workplace rights on this issue and because of the poor working conditions for many (broken hours of
work, low wages, difficult working conditions). We conclude with some recommendations, including the Right to request,
which appears to be the best option, although it would need some further analysis.

balancing work and family, and a good number of employees
sometimes consider leaving their job or leaving the labor
market earlier because of important difficulties in this area
(Lazzari, 2012; Tremblay, 2012a, 2012b; Dykeman &
Williams, 2013). This is particularly important for carers (of
elderly or ill parents or partners) who are in employment
(Lero, Spinks, Fast, Hilbrecht, & Tremblay, 2012) but can
also touch other groups of the population. Concerning the
challenges and difficulties of work­family balance in gen-
eral, studies show that job characteristics are essential to
explain the importance of the work­family conflict (Guérin,
St-Onge, Chenevier, Denault, & Deschamps, 1994; Guérin,
St-Onge, Trottier, Haines, & Simard, 1997).
Over the years and with the development of the service
economy, many precarious and atypical types of jobs have
been created. This increase in jobs and demand for services
is due not only to the increased presence of women in the
labor but also to an aging population, which needs services
during long hours, sometimes outside of the regular 9 to 5
working hours (nursery, day care, health services 24 hr a day,
7 days per week; Lero et al., 2012; Tremblay, 2012a, 2012b,
2007; Tremblay & Larivière, 2013).
As mentioned above, the majority of research on work­
family issues has focused on relatively advantaged profes-
sional categories (cf. Tremblay, 2012a, 2013), so we wanted
this time to turn to the less advantaged workers, with difficult
working conditions. We therefore decided to study the home
help services, which are all the more important in the context
of an increasing demand for these services due to the aging
population.
Faced with an aging population, one of the aims of the
Quebec (a Canadian province) government is to help people
wishing to age in their home to achieve this. With the project
called "Aging and live together at home, in the community,"
(our translation from French), one of the objectives is to
"allow seniors who wish to stay at home as long as possible
to do so and to ensure that their safety is not compromised"
(Ministère de la Famille et desAînés [MFA], 2012).Although
for many years, women took charge of the private sphere and
men the public sphere, the current situation is certainly dif-
ferent with women's access to employment (Cloutier,
Bernard, & Tremblay, 2011).
In the area of home care in general, but especially in ser-
vices for seniors, jobs are sometimes criticized as being of
poor quality (Devetter, Janice-Catrice, & Ribault, 2009), and
we did observe this also in our research. Indeed, these jobs
are characterized by elements such as low pay, low qualifica-
tion, and little recognition of these qualifications (CERC,
2008). The concept of "quality of employment" usually
includes various dimensions such as training, compensation,
and working conditions, which can be seen as partly depen-
dent on human resource management practices, as they
determine workplace rights and working conditions.
Our article shows how the employees in this sector recon-
cile their work and family and personal life, given the low
level of workplace rights--they are usually non-unionized
and subject only to the minimum labor standards--as well as
the low quality of their employment and difficulty of their
working conditions. This led us to the following questions:
Given their working conditions and low workplace rights,
how do male and female employees manage to reconcile
work and family life and in the area of home care, and par-
ticularly in domestic work for the elderly?
To answer this question, a study was conducted with 33
employees and 23 employers in this sector. First, we present
a short literature review on the issue of home care, then on
the issue of work­family/life balance, focusing on the area of
home care. Then, we present the respondents, the data collec-
tion technique, and finally our results.
Home Care, Work­Family, and Work­
Life
Home Care Workers
We reviewed literature on home care aides or home care
workers as they are often called, but we call them domestic
workers, as in our case, these workers do not do anything
related to health or physical care but only domestic work to
help the elderly stay at home. There has not been much
research on this theme; most research is on the health home
care, and this is precisely what brought us to look into work-
ing conditions of home domestic workers.
The existing literature mainly highlights the increasing
need for personal assistance services in industrialized econo-
mies, and some research shows that it is mainly women,
some indicating mainly older women who do these jobs,
which are usually low-status and low-wage work (Butler,
Wardamasky, & Brennan-Ing, 2012).
A certain number of articles are centered on factors that
lead workers to leave or to stay in these jobs (Butler et al.,
2012; Faul et al., 2010). Some articles look into the factors
that can improve these jobs (Kemper et al., 2008). One arti-
cle (Butler et al., 2012) has studied home care aides and has
shown that low and variable compensation often forced
workers to leave these jobs, particularly the younger work-
ers; however, they indicate that these workers surprisingly
find more rewarding than challenging aspects to the job.
In the context where many economies are looking for new
cost-effective models for elderly home care, another article
indicates that the new market model of home care can lead to
less job satisfaction and a higher propensity to leave the job
(Denton, Zeytinoglu, Kusch, & Davies, 2007). This research
deals with health home care, and we have not found similar
work on the group of workers who do domestic work.
However, some elements found in this research were inte-
grated for analysis in our own work (job characteristics,
workload, work intensification, number of visits per day and
time spent for this, organizational and peer support, job inse-
curity, relations with clients, etc.). Geiger-Brown, Muntaner,
Tremblay and Ilama 3
McPhaul, Lipscomb, and Trinkoff (2007) have looked into
the issues of abuse and violence in home care, and found this
could lead to depression. In our own work, we also looked
into this question but actually found few elements to confirm
any form of abuse or violence; on the contrary, most workers
indicate that the elderly for whom they work are eager and
happy to have them at home.
Another research indicates that home care workers have
"a conflicted, often contradictory, relationship to their
labour" (Stacey, 2005, p. 831). Stacey (2005) indicates that
workers can find in this work some constraints that can
reduce their capacity to do a good job or to see the work as
meaningful and rewarding. However, this research highlights
the fact that workers can however find meaning in such a job.
Our results are close to what Stacey (2005) reports; it appears
that workers actually find dignity in the cleaning work (or
dirty work, as Stacey puts it).
Domestic home work for the elderly is clearly a particular
sector of activity as it is situated paradoxically at the fron-
tiers of public and private spheres (Martin-Matthews, 2007);
in Québec, the public sector contributes to the financing of
domestic workers for the elderly, and these workers partly
financed by the public sector enter the private sphere of
elderly people.
Our literature review shows that research has mainly cen-
tered on health care workers and less on domestic work, and
this led us to look into the work­family balance issue for this
group. We wanted to complete the picture presented by exist-
ing research and try to determine whether these workers do
manage to deal with the constraints of the work. We also
observed that if working conditions were treated in some
research, no work had been done on the impact of these con-
ditions on work­family and work­life challenges.
Definition of Work­Family and Work­Life
Challenges
Having decided to address the issue of work­family and
work­life for this group, we pursued our literature review on
this theme. The expression of "work­family balance" is
fairly recent, and it is with the feminization of employment
that the term appeared in the literature during the 1990s
(Tremblay, 2005). However, the term work­life or work­
family balance does not always lead to consensus among
researchers. Some choose to speak of "articulating work­
family," others of "harmonization between work and personal
life" or of "balancing work and family" (Tremblay, 2012b).
The first expression refers to both employment and family,
but the inclusion of "personal life" is also used to extend
beyond responsibilities of working parents, to include those
who have older handicapped children or elderly/ill parents.
Indeed, over time, researchers have gone beyond parental
responsibilities to include the responsibilities of anyone who
has gainful employment and who wishes to have time for his
or her personal life, thus adopting a perspective centered
more on a life course view. It must be recognized that family
responsibilities are increasing the difficulties related to
working time for many workers, and although the work­
family issue has not translated into workplace rights in most
countries (see the debate on "Right to request" working time
arrangements, cf. Tremblay & Nogues, 2014), we consider
that this should warrant special attention from the employers
(Tremblay, 2012b).
The expression of work­family reconciliation or integra-
tion refers to the objective of reducing a real or potential con-
flict between work and family. The work or employment
dimension refers to the workplace, workplace rights, and the
specifics of the job, especially the degree of autonomy in
work, workload, workplace rights, or other job specifica-
tions, which can influence the level of work­life conflict
(Guérin et al., 1994; Tremblay, 2012a, 2012b, 2012c). The
job specifications and workplace rights are essential to deter-
mine the importance of the work­family conflict by socio-
professional class, as the difficulties clearly vary depending
on the professional category, various groups having different
levels of autonomy, a different type of workload, and work-
place rights (Tremblay, 2012a, 2014; Tremblay & Mascova,
2013). Constraints at work may be more important while
workplace rights may be lower, as in the group studied here,
and these may then constitute an important obstacle to work­
family balance (Guérin et al., 1997; Tremblay, 2012a, 2012b,
2013).
Work­Family Conflict in Québec
Not only are work­family challenges different from one sec-
tor to the other, but the link between work and family changes
over time (Tremblay, 2012a, 2012b). It should first be noted
that the number of mothers in the labor market has increased
considerably, a change that has occurred particularly since
the 1960s (St-Amour, Laverdure, Devault, & Manseau,
2005; Tremblay, 2004, 2012a, 2012b); women's presence in
the labor market has an impact not only on child care but also
on elder care (Lero et al., 2012; Tremblay & Larivière, 2013).
In the 1980s, not only has Quebec seen an increase in wom-
en's participation in the labor market, but also, the participa-
tion of young mothers has increased (Tremblay, 2004, 2012a,
2012b).
The new labor market includes more dual-income fami-
lies, more and more single women workers who must pro-
vide care for children, and many men and women who need
to provide care for elderly parents or disabled persons (Lero
et al., 2012; Tremblay & Larivière, 2013). Also noteworthy
is the aging of the population, which clearly represents an
increased challenge in balancing work and family, as women
are often also caring for elderly relatives (St-Amour et al.,
2005; Tremblay & Larivière, 2013). This has also contrib-
uted in an important increase in the number of home care and
domestic care jobs, so that domestic workers are at the fore-
front of today's challenges in an aging society with more and
4 SAGE Open
more women active in the labor market and thus less avail-
able to offer care and support to elderly members of the
family.
Finally, several changes have occurred in the labor market
and in employment relationships (Tremblay, 2004). We are
witnessing a gradual and steady decline in the normal work-
ing hours (the traditional "9 to 5") and an increase in atypical
schedules or "non-standard," split schedules; evening, night,
irregular schedules; and so on. Women working in the ser-
vice sector are quite concerned by these changes as they are
the majority in the areas of retail, health, restaurants, and
hotels, where these working schedules and working times are
most frequently observed (Tremblay, 2012a).
Domestic Care in Quebec
We now present the situation of domestic work for elderly
care in Québec. Although there are some private companies
active in this field, home care often falls within the scope of
the social economy in Québec. Indeed, since 2006, the
Québec government has favored the development of various
social economy sectors and companies, and these social
economy firms are characterized by social objectives. As
indicated on their website, the social economy firms were
created to promote the satisfaction of individuals and local
communities, and the social economy is very much centered
on human values (Tremblay, 2012c). Among the 10 sectors
that are part of the social economy, personal services attracted
our attention when we decided to look at work­life issues in
the less advantaged sectors of the economy (from the point
of view of wages, working conditions, and rights). This cat-
egory of personal services brings together all services con-
tributing to the well-being of people wherever they live,
whether it be their home, place of work or leisure. The per-
sonal services sector is however very diversified (Pétillon,
2009). We chose to look into home care services to seniors,
and particularly domestic services (not health or nursing ser-
vices), which help maintain the elderly in their homes by
doing the cleaning for them. This sector occupies a special
place in personal services because of the nature of jobs and
the type of clients or beneficiaries involved (the elderly and
frail benefit from special support programs).
In Quebec, in the context of the provision of public ser-
vices, home help services are integrated into the broader cat-
egory of "home support" services to the elderly or frail
people, people with disabilities, and sick or convalescing,
which also include professional home care (doctors, nurses,
occupational therapists, etc.). Home help services refers to
the following: personal assistance services: health care, food
aid, assistance to the mobilization and transfer, domestic
help services (housekeeping home, meal preparation, laun-
dry, shopping, etc.), and community activities related to civic
support (help in administering a budget, completing admin-
istrative forms, etc.; Ministère de la santé et des services
sociaux [MSSS], 2004).
Faced with an aging population, the need for domestic
help has increased over recent years (Ratel, 2012). Depending
on requirements, these home care services can be offered by
the local authority, community organizations, volunteer
groups, staff hired directly by the local health services, per-
sonnel hired directly by individuals, or social economy firms,
and the latter have become important providers over the
years (MSSS, 2004).
The history of the development of these services helps us
understand the increase in the share of the social economy
firms over the years. During the period of 1984-1990, the
community services supported by the government (CLSC-
Local Center for Community Services) started to use private
companies rather than their own personnel to give services,
which contributed to a privatization movement over time.
The public sector became less important in the delivery of
services, while the private sector increased its presence.
Indeed, with the support of the Ministry of Health and Social
Services (MSSS) as well as regional health centers and social
services (CRSSS), a large share of public funds was used to
outsource to private sector companies the home care ser-
vices, rather than use public sector staff (Vaillancourt &
Jetté, 1997). By 1996, the CLSC (public services) had started
to use mainly the social economy enterprises in domestic
help (ESSAD- Entreprises d`économie sociale en services
d`aide domestique ) for the delivery of home help services.
Over time, the state officially recognized these social econ-
omy firms (ESSAD) by giving them direct funding for these
services. The ESSAD now provide most of the housekeeping
for the elderly, and these services are practically no longer
offered by public structures (Boivin, 2013).
The quality of employment, as well as working conditions
and rights, is a major issue in the field of home care. Indeed,
the quality of employment for carers, including domestic
helpers, is often considered to be of lesser quality. (Boivin,
2013) The difficulty of this work refers in particular to diffi-
cult schedules, split schedules, travel between places of
work, and generally the difficulty of the work itself. Working
conditions combine industrial discomforts and some chal-
lenges of the service sector in dealing with individuals
(Boivin, 2013; Volkoff & Gollac, 2007), and this clearly sup-
ports the idea of difficult working conditions and low-level
employment in this sector (Devetter et al., 2009), as well as a
general absence of workplace rights (Boivin, 2013). In
Québec, as mentioned above, workers mainly rely on the
minimal workplace rights offered by the minimal standards
law (2 weeks vacation, overtime pay over 40 hr, and the like,
but no right to working time arrangements whatsoever).
Also, among the various work-related discomforts, Juhel
(1998) mentions the physical and mental exhaustion, con-
tacts with beneficiaries who may be difficult, monotony of
tasks, and often the lack of time to perform all tasks. These
are all elements that we found in the work done by the
domestic help workers; although the working conditions
may be a little easier in the social economy sector, the work
Tremblay and Ilama 5
itself remains difficult, and the schedules are also often split
schedules as is the case in the private sector.
In our research, we thus wanted to address the issue of
how these employees reconcile their work and family respon-
sibilities as well personal life in the context of working con-
ditions and workplace rights that are rather minimal.
Our Research on Work­Family
Challenges in the Home Help Sector
Portrait of Respondents and Research Method
Portrait of respondents. We conducted a qualitative research
based on semi-structured interviews lasting on average 1.5 hr
with 33 domestic workers in Quebec, namely, 10 employees
in the private sector and 23 in the social economy firms
(ESSAD). We also interviewed 23 employers with 3 private
companies and 20 ESSAD managers. In this article, we con-
centrate on the views of employees, although the employers'
views gave us a better understanding of the specifics of the
context and confirmed some elements from the employee
interviews. We need to mention that to access the employees,
we had to go through the managers, and interviews were car-
ried out under a voluntary basis, after managers put out a call
for volunteers to contact us directly. The domestic help
workers that we met were all working with elderly people
who wanted to stay at home but needed regular support to
do so.
Method of analysis. We used content analysis as it is proposed
by a group of colleagues (Bardin, 1993; Savall & Zardet,
2000) who designed a method of thematic treatment based on
excerpts from the interviews, which they call "witness sen-
tences." This method brings us to encode the text, and analyze
it to gain an understanding of the representations and inter-
pretations of the respondents' discourse. It is based on the
division of the text into sections, reading section by section to
determine the important elements of content, and then encod-
ing the various categories or themes (Fallery & Rodhain,
2007). The transcripts were cut into sections and analyzed
with the ideas or words contained in these sections. In other
words, we identified key sentences expressed by the respon-
dents, which some colleagues call "witnesses sentences"
(Savall & Zardet, 2000). This method allowed us to find "pat-
terns" and to collect and understand the research results.
Research Results
Importantdifficultieswithworkplaceconditionsandrights.Accord-
ing to our interviews, the home help staff faces difficult situa-
tions regarding working conditions and workplace rights. In
terms of schedules and hours of work, employees indicate
that the number of hours of work varies quite often, and
schedules are often split. People who work on-call do not
always visit the same customers, and therefore, the hours can
vary considerably in some cases. Many mention the complex
issue of working hours, and their fragmentation, which
causes instability in private life. Moreover, hours and sched-
ules are strongly related to the working environment; as
many mention, this type of work is done essentially in the
homes of the beneficiaries of domestic help, and it mainly
has to do with cleaning the house or apartment.
Workers are often confronted with unpredictable events,
and this can have an impact on their working hours. For
example, an elderly person can cancel a service at the last
minute, for various reasons (hospitalization, not feeling well,
or whatever). The worker is then not paid, without any right
to some form of compensation for the lost hours and wage. It
apparently happens relatively frequently that the client/ben-
eficiary falls ill or he or she returns to the hospital, so this can
have an important impact on the worker's and the family's
budget.
Travel times are sometimes long as distances between two
clients can be important. Again, there is no right to any form
of compensation here, although some social economy firms
pay for the public transportation ticket. However, as some
workers mentioned, it is sometimes preferable to go by car,
to lose less time in transportation and thus reduce the total
length of the workday. This is particularly important for lone
mothers, who cannot pay for someone to take care of their
kids until they come home. Although there is public day care
in Québec, if a parent takes more time to return home, there
is no pay for the extra time at the end of the day. The vari-
ability of distances is important due to the fact that the
employee does not work in the same place every day, nor
even every half day; not having the same client means work-
ers are required to travel all the time. Interviewees who work
outside of the main cities mentioned that they cover a very
large territory, and therefore, transportation time can be quite
long, and all the more so when they are on call, and the places
visited can vary on short notice. A few excerpts from the
interviews confirm this:
Interview 3: 
I have no contract, I am always on call. The
CLSC contacts me and if there are calls I take
them as I prefer to work full time than part-
time, so as long as there are calls, I take them,
even if at a distance.
Interview 1: 
Work schedules, it's complicated, sometimes
I start at midnight at Mrs. K's, sometimes it's
early morning. It may be just the afternoon,
one hour, two hours. That's more difficult . . .
this is the most difficult part of the job, I'll
say, it's worse in the private sector here, there
is nothing stable here. There are stable con-
tracts yes, but there are not many.
Interview 14: 
The number of hours, it depends, sometimes
we have cancelations, there is no other client
to replace, and we lose our hours. I normally
do 32 hours. I would like to work more hours
6 SAGE Open
yet . . . I'd like to do a little more over my 30
hours, yes.
Interview 19:
The hours are very variable, because in my
area, I am in a rural area, so the houses are far
apart, the area I cover is large, the country is
big so I can have important distances to cover.
Also I live in St-Gabriel, I have to go one
place two or three times a week and that is a
40-45 minutes drive, and I often have to drive
20 minutes to the clients' places.
These quotes from the interviews highlight some of the
difficulties facing these employees. Schedules and hours of
work are not stable, there are problems due to the large ter-
ritories covered by the workers, and the work schedules are
sometimes changed because of cancelations. These workers
have no rights to compensation for these last-minute changes,
nor for the long driving distances, even if their wages are
quite low, usually minimum wage and sometimes a little
higher, but not much. Faced with these difficulties, we
wanted to see how these employees manage to reconcile
their work and family and personal life.
An important work­family challenge. Most employees do not
expect to have any form of workplace rights regarding work­
family reconciliation. They do not seem to expect support
from their employer, and this is probably one of the most
surprising results, especially as work­family issues have
been high on the agenda in public discussions in Québec for
some years now, and other professional groups will put for-
ward requests to their employers (Tremblay, 2012a, 2012b,
2012c). However, these low expectations are probably due
precisely to the low quality of employment and workplace
rights.
Most workers, men as well as women, say they just "man-
age personally" to get things done and to balance work, fam-
ily, and personal activities. They do not seem to expect much
from their employer in terms of support, although they do put
forward their preferences in terms of schedules and hours,
but just hope that the employer can take them into account,
which appears to be somewhat more frequent in the social
economy firms than in other firms, but cannot be guaranteed,
because of frequent changes in the clients'demands and situ-
ation (illness, hospitalization, etc.).
The workers manage to balance work and family in differ-
ent ways, and they put forward five explanations. The first
explanation refers simply to the fact that a majority of women
say that they just organize themselves personally to reconcile
work and family life to cope with the demands of work and
family simultaneously. They have no choice to work, and
they expect no special support although the social economy
context can present some advantages over the private sector.
Indeed, marginal social benefits are sometimes better. Also,
in a few cases, there is a retirement and medical plan, which
is offered by the social economy group collectively and to
which individual firms can adhere, but it is not all that do.
Finally, sometimes the employer takes their needs into
account in terms of working hours or schedules, or at least
try to as much as possible.
According to one employee, "In life, you have to work
and you need to have some personal organization to manage
to balance work and family"; this woman is therefore not
expecting any help or support from her employer but consid-
ers that she has to organize things by herself. A worker indi-
cates that she organizes the family chores to reconcile
everything, and she manages to do her work and spend time
with her husband. She tries to keep the whole weekend for
her husband and his family. Another employee arranges to
have some "good time," organizing her schedule accordingly
and communicating the hours she is available to her
employer, who seems to respect her requests (in a social
economy firm). If there are things to be done, they are done
when she is on leave or has some time off. According to
another employee, this strategy of personal organization also
requires sacrifices, for being on call, the employee may be
contacted by the company at any time. However, some con-
sider that schedule flexibility is an advantage for work­fam-
ily reconciliation.
The second type of explanation has to do with persons
who say they do not have so much difficulty in reconciling
work and family inasmuch as their children are now adults.
In one case, the children are grown up, they are independent,
and they also know that their mother needs to work, so they
do not ask too much of her.
In the third group, the interviewees indicated that they did
not have children and only have their house or spouse to take
care of and seem to manage correctly in this context. In the
fourth group, the employees say they have no problem in
terms of work­family integration; for them, the most impor-
tant aspect is to not bring work problems back home. They
say they need to think of other things. They manage to get
work schedules that make it possible for them to spend more
time with their children. Although some admit it is difficult
to find time to do their own cleaning and housework, employ-
ees in social economy firms say they can put forward their
requests in terms of working hours, and schedules, and the
employer usually tries to respect their requests. They have no
rights per se to a given schedule or given hours, but there
seems to be a mutual agreement in some organizations, and
things can work out well for some of the workers.
However, the fifth group has to do with single mothers,
for whom it is often difficult to reconcile everything. A single
mother has three children from different fathers, and she
admits she struggles to balance work, family, and personal
life. She says it is difficult to hold a full-time job, which could
help her support her children. She tends to work part-time,
which is not always the best solution from a financial point of
view. Another woman mentions that she has no time for her
children, except on Saturdays. It is difficult to cook a decent
meal for the kids after work, she says, and it is impossible to
Tremblay and Ilama 7
work full-time: "I work a full 3 days, the other 2 days I work
a half-day. When you are a single parent, you have no
choice." Another employee indicates that it is difficult to rec-
oncile work and family because she lives with her husband
and two children, and she has no one to help. This woman is
an immigrant woman, and she lives only with her husband
and children, the rest of the family having remained in their
country of origin. A quote from the interviews supports this
view where these workers tend to organize by themselves,
not having specific rights to working time arrangements or
support, and things just get easier when children grow up:
Interview 15: 
Well, that's okay, that's fine, I have children
they are not all teen but they know that I
need to work. And that's okay, I don't have
too much problems with this.
Interview 16: 
It's perfect, my son is 20, my daughter is 24
years old, my daughter does not live at home,
she has her family, my son's doing well, I
prepare the meal, then if he is working he
just has to warm it up, they are grown chil-
dren so I'm ok now.
As for the men in our respondent group, there are only
five of them, and two of the five men say that they organize
themselves to balance work and family (but they do not seem
particularly involved in family chores or responsibilities).
According to one of them, people need to organize them-
selves so that they can socialize and have a life.Another indi-
cates that he prefers to work at night, because otherwise,
work would intrude with his social life. Another is separated
from his wife and has one child, but he considers himself
"lucky" as he does not have custody of the child and consid-
ers it would be difficult for him to balance work and family
if he did have custody! Not having the child, it is possible for
him to work from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and also follow some
evening classes at the university.
A fourth man says that work­family balance is a state of
mind; he feels quite relaxed, and he does not have a large
family, which also helps to reconcile work and family. The
fourth says that he prioritizes family, and work comes sec-
ond. Many moments are spent with his family, and many
activities are done together. The fifth man indicates he priori-
tizes work and expects his employer to respect his requests
for the given working hours and schedules.
Interview 2: 
I take the time to do what I have to do. We're
together all the time: it's activities, family
dinner, I see the family all the time and my
work comes second.
Interview 3: 
Once I decided to work, I gave my availabil-
ity for work, so I focus more on my work
than being at home. If you have decided to
go to someone's house for the cleaning, you
have to put it first.
Here, we see a significant difference with women who
have young children because it is very rare that they do not
have custody, and some are also single mothers.
Interview 7: 
It is difficult. Especially here I have no time to
myself and no one to help. I'm just with my hus-
band and my two children, and I do everything.
A woman employee mentions that she takes care of her
grandson and now devotes time to him, but she says she has
asked to have less clients as she must also get to the school
and day care.
Also, although schedules are flexible in several organiza-
tions that use these people, mainly in the social economy
firms, many mention that they are always "running for time."
Still, most do not expect support from the employer.
Interview 6: 
In life you have to work, work is important in
life. It's like everyone here, we manage work
and family; if we have 1 hour, we try to we
plan everything, our schedules and all that.
Interview 8: 
I manage to have time for myself, that's for
sure, it's important, I arrange my schedule
accordingly. Then if I have things to do, I
manage to do them when I know I will be on
leave. I manage.
In short, employees in this type of work experience many
difficulties in terms of schedules and working hours, and also
in terms of traveling to each of the homes. To balance their
work, family, and personal life, employees organize things
by themselves, giving their preferred hours and schedules
and hoping the employer can give them these hours, which
happens more in the social economy sector than in the pri-
vate sector. However, single parenthood is a real problem
because it is not always very easy to reconcile work and fam-
ily in this type of situation, as many women have told us.
Conclusion
The objective of this article was to understand how domestic
workers in elderly care manage to balance their work, their
family, and personal life, given their specific, and often dif-
ficult, working conditions. To do this, we first did a literature
review on home care workers and on challenges of work­
family conflict and reconciliation.
Considering the time conflict caused by the different roles
and tasks that many women and men have to assume with
regard to their family, and the difficulty of combining the
competing demands of family and work, it is surprising to
see that most employees interviewed expect very little sup-
port from their employer, although some request and do
obtain specific schedules and working hours. In this type of
low-wage and low-education job, workers only have mini-
mal labor rights, and our results show that they do not expect
8 SAGE Open
workplace support for their work­family challenge as is
more often the case in professions such as law (Tremblay &
Mascova, 2013) and other higher level jobs (Tremblay,
2012a, 2012b).
Our results allow us to say that despite a work environ-
ment that is complex and difficult, domestic workers helping
with the cleaning at elderly persons' homes appear to orga-
nize by themselves. They manage to more or less balance
their work, family, and personal life, inasmuch as they can
given the constraints.
Although the social economy firms seem to offer a little
more support, at least in arranging schedules according to
preferences, people working in these firms as well as those
working in the private firms consider that work­family bal-
ance is essentially a question of personal organization.
Indeed, they do not seem to expect much support from the
employer, and they do not expect workplace rights to be
developed in relation to work­family issues in this sector, as
is more often the case in unionized environments and higher
level work statuses (Tremblay, 2012a, 2012b). This may be
explained by the fact that most employees have a low level of
education and cannot have accessto many other types of
jobs, so they accept these rather low workplace rights and
working conditions for lack of better options. Women with-
out children and those whose children are grown up have
fewer difficulties. Single mothers clearly indicate they have
difficulty, all the while still not expecting anything in terms
of workplace rights.
In our view, there is clearly an issue here, and it would be
interesting to consider some recommendations to make these
workers'situation somewhat easier. First, we would consider
developing the "right to request" working time arrange-
ments, as this has been developed in a few countries, such as
Australia, Great Britain, and New Zealand (Tremblay &
Nogues, 2014). This would be an interesting extension of
this research, as it may offer an alternative for low-wage and
low-rights workers, who generally do not have much auton-
omy or support in their work environment.
We might also consider developing options to exchange
schedules between workers, when some schedules enter in
conflict with a worker's family or personal obligations.
Firms could develop a system to permit workers to exchange
working hours with another worker, although this might be
more difficult to have accepted by the clients, that is, elderly
persons who like to see the same person each week, even if it
is not for health care but for cleaning the home. Finally,
another option could be to develop teamwork, having the
workers take on tasks in teams of two, which would make it
easier if one needed to be absent at a given time.
However, in our view, the best option would clearly be to
develop a more universal and legally enforceable "right to
request" for all workers with family obligations, as this group
is not particularly confident in its capacity to put forward and
obtain any form of benefit or advantage. For this and other
low-level jobs, a universal right would be easier for them to
request and enforce in their own work environment.
