Abstract
Social media and text messaging show promise as public health interventions, but little evaluation of implementation exists. The
B'more Healthy Communities for Kids (BHCK) was a multilevel, multicomponent (wholesalers, food stores, recreation centers)
childhood obesity prevention trial that included social media and text-messaging components. The BHCK was implemented in 28
low-income areas of Baltimore City, Maryland, in 2 waves. The texting intervention targeted 241 low-income African American
caregivers (of 283), who received 3 texts/week reinforcing key messages, providing nutrition information, and weekly goals.
Regular posting on social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) targeted community members and local stakeholders.
High implementation standards were set a priori (57 for social media, 11 for texting), with low implementation defined as <50%,
medium as 50% to 99%, high as 100% of the high standard for each measure. Reach, dose delivered, and fidelity were assessed
via web-based analytic tools. Between waves, social media implementation improved from low-moderate to high reach, dose
delivered, and fidelity. Text messaging increased from moderate to high in reach and dose delivered, fidelity decreased from
high to moderate. Data were used to monitor and revise the BHCK intervention throughout implementation. Our model for
evaluating text messaging­based and social media­based interventions may be applicable to other settings.

What do we already know about this topic?
Past interventions have successfully tested social media and text messaging's positive effect on healthy eating, weight
loss, and physical activity, but few have set evaluation metrics for these strategies.
How does your research contribute to the field?
This paper sets process evaluation standards for implementation of a social media and text-messaging program in a
multilevel-multicomponent obesity prevention intervention and suggests best practices for managing these platforms.
What are your research's implications toward theory, practice, or policy?
This research suggests the benefit of conducting detailed process evaluation when aiming to improve intervention imple-
mentation and provides practices that researchers can use in future interventions to promote behavior change through
social media and text messaging.

Introduction
Obesity is a public health crisis with significant costs for
individuals, communities, and governments.1,2 In Baltimore,
the obesity epidemic affects adults and children, particularly
black and lower income populations with less access to
healthful foods.3,4
As there are various factors that contribute to childhood
obesity, research has urged for multilevel interventions that
simultaneously address these factors.5,6 Multilevel-
multicomponent (ML-MC) interventions intervene at multiple

settings concurrently (eg, corner stores, worksites, and recre-
ation centers) and use multiple components (eg, education,
social marketing, policy) to target sustainable systems change.7
However, these programs can be costly to implement and may
have weak reach to target audiences due to diffusion of limited
resources.7,8 Multiple intervention strategies need to connect
and reinforce each other, such that intervention components
are synchronized across levels.7
Social media and text messaging have the potential to
support multilevel interventions due to their high reach,
relatively low cost, and ability to tie together diverse inter-
ventions.9,10 Internet and social media use have substan-
tially risen over the past decade, with 65% of American
adults using at least 1 social media site as of 2015.11 Social
media refers to Internet-based platforms that allow people
to communicate and interact.10 Text messaging is another
common form of communication across all age groups;
more than 70% of cell phone owners in the age groups 18
to 29 years, 30 to 49 years, and 50 to 64 years cited that
they used their phones to send or receive text messages in
2013.12 African Americans and Hispanics are more likely
to text than their white counterparts.12 Although several
interventions have successfully tested social media and
text messaging's positive effect on healthy eating,9 weight
loss,13 and physical activity,14,15 few have set evaluation
metrics for these strategies, which detracts from our under-
standing and use of these technologies as intervention
tools.14,16 In addition, we have not identified any study to
date that has set standards for implementation of social
media and text messaging in a ML-MC obesity prevention
intervention. This paper addresses these gaps by describ-
ing the process evaluation of the text messaging and social
media components of the B'more Healthy Communities
for Kids (BHCK) intervention.17
Methods
Intervention Overview
The BHCK was a childhood obesity prevention, group-
randomized trial implemented in 2 waves.17 In each wave,
14 zones were selected upon meeting study's eligibility
criteria: low-income, predominantly African American
(>50%) neighborhood with a recreation center at least 0.5
miles from a supermarket. Neighborhoods were random-
ized to be an intervention or comparison zone (n = 28 total
zones). Different zones were used for waves 1 and 2.
Within each zone, an evaluation sample of African
American caregivers, defined as any adult (>18 years old)
responsible for taking care of a 10- to 14-year-old child,
was actively recruited at community sites (eg, recreation
centers, corner stores, carryout restaurants, parks). The first
wave of BHCK intervention was implemented from June
2014 to February 2015; the second wave from November
2015 to July 2016.17 Our evaluation sample included 150
and 133 caregivers in wave 1 and wave 2, respectively. The
BHCK intervened on different components of the Baltimore
food environment (corner stores, carryout restaurants,
wholesaler, and recreation centers) and at different socio-
ecological levels (policy, small food stores, afterschool
program, and informational environment--social media
and text messaging).
Prior to intervention, three focus groups with youth, ages
10 to 14 years, and their adult caregivers were conducted in
predominantly African American communities in Baltimore
(n = 20). Most participants used at least one of the following
social media sites: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Tumblr,
with Facebook being most popular. Participants were open to
communicating and receiving BHCK updates through social
media and texts, and provided feedback on the types of mes-
sages they preferred to receive.
Based on the formative research, we chose Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter, and text messaging to reach caregivers
and connect and reinforce various BHCK intervention
components. Content delivered on these platforms paral-
leled the 3 phases delivered in other intervention levels:
smart drinks, smart snacks, and smart cooking. Intervention
was guided by social cognitive theory, with goal-setting
messages and bidirectional interactions to enhance self-
efficacy and reinforce positive health behaviors to encour-
age behavioral change.18 Sharing recipes and individual
stories of success on our social media accounts and text-
messaging campaign promoted observational learning.
Replying encouraging messages to BHCK participants
who texted us with questions or responses to our chal-
lenge-of-the-week text messages also promoted behavioral
reinforcement. The BHCK interventionists also sought to
improve self-efficacy with supportive posts that helped
people to identify where healthier choices were available
in their food environment, especially when promoted
healthy food and drink items were stocked and on sale in
the corner stores and carryout restaurants that were coop-
erating with BHCK.
The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Institutional Review Board (IRB No. 00004203) approved
this research; written informed consent was obtained from
all adult participants.
Social Media and Text-Messaging Recruitment
Wave 1 recruitment for social media and text messaging
started 1 month before overall BHCK intervention in June
2014 to build initial follower base. All eligible caregivers
in the intervention evaluation arm (n = 150) were invited
to join via email, phone, and letter using contact informa-
tion gathered at their baseline interview.17 Participants
could choose between receiving 3 and 5 texts per week.
They joined the text-messaging program with a specific
keyword and were invited to follow BHCK social media
pages.
Loh et al 3
Wave 2 recruitment of caregivers in the evaluation inter-
vention sample (n = 133) took place during the baseline
interview (April-November 2015). Those who were not
invited or initially declined invitation were called afterward
about enrolling in the program. Based on wave 1 partici-
pants'preference for 3 texts per week, all wave 2 participants
were texted 3 texts per week at off-peak hours.
To involve the community, social media handles were
printed on all wave 2 posters and handouts distributed at
stores and recreation centers, and on cooperating carryout
menus. Participants in the intervention evaluation arm were
actively invited to follow the pages through email, mail,
texts, and calls. Unlike text messaging, social media pages
were open to the public to reach a larger audience and poten-
tial stakeholders.
Text-Messaging Intervention
The BHCK text-messaging intervention targeted adult care-
givers. Messages were drafted by BHCK interventionists,
who were undergraduate and graduate students trained in
nutrition and public health, revised by the registered dieti-
tians on the research team, approved by the primary investi-
gator. The content was designed to encourage bidirectional
communication and allowed for individual follow-up
(Supplemental Table S1). Contact names were used to per-
sonalize text messages. First text of the week was goal-ori-
ented, with the promoted task related to the unit concurrently
taught at the recreation center and corner stores. To encour-
age response from participants, a yes or no question was typi-
cally sent at the end of the week, asking whether they
achieved the weekly challenge. Other message content
included information to support goal attainment, nutrition
information, recipes for promoted food items, and their cost
and availability at corner stores (Supplemental Table S1).
Enrolled participants could opt-out at any point.
TextIt (https://textit.in) was used in wave 1, because it
allowed scheduling of message flows, with automated
responses to preset questions. Due to issues with message
delivery and scheduling inflexibility, BHCK switched to EZ
Texting (https://app.eztexting.com) during wave 2. The
BHCK also used MobileVip (http://mobilevip.me), a custom-
made texting platform that allowed scheduling of automated
responses to preset questions and improved successful text
message delivery.
Social Media Intervention
Social media, namely Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter,
broadened BHCK by targeting the whole Baltimore commu-
nity. Content promoted other program components, includ-
ing BHCK posters and handouts, photos from recreation
centers and corner store interventions, the youth leaders
(local college students trained to deliver the BHCK after-
school program), and cooperating wholesalers and corner
storeowners. The BHCK social media also shared Baltimore-
specific news and community events to engage the
community.
Facebook. It allowed for longer and more frequent posts than
text messaging and the other social media platforms (ie, Ins-
tagram and Twitter) and use of links, photos and videos, cre-
ating a more comprehensive communication platform to
reach study sample and other members within and beyond
Baltimore. The wave 1 Facebook page was maintained for
wave 2 to retain initial follower base. Using a set weekly
posting schedule (Supplemental Table S2), interventionists
posted at least once a day in the evening, which was when
most of BHCK's followers were online based on Facebook
Analytics, to optimize post engagement.
Instagram. During wave 1, users were less engaged with the
"BHCK1" Instagram page than our Facebook Page, such that
the Instagram page had much fewer followers and likes and
comments per post. A new account with a catchier title of
"Bmore4kids" was hence created for wave 2. Before wave 2
implementation, preintervention posting about general nutri-
tion and networking (via liking, following, and commenting)
with users within the target community helped create a sub-
stantial follower base (n = 1443) with the aim of giving cre-
dence to the account as a reliable source for nutrition advice
and community news. The BHCK interventionists posted
according to a weekly posting schedule (Supplemental Table
S3) with 1 to 2 posts per day, as posting on average 1.5 times
per day was found to be best practice.19 All Instagram posts
were generally linked to and posted on Facebook. The BHCK
had weekly Instagram challenges that corresponded to that
week's text-messaging goal, and large giveaway challenges
per phase to increase participation. Large giveaway chal-
lenges were different to the weekly challenges in that they
are larger scale, with the competition open for entry for lon-
ger than a week and involved gift incentives, such that all
Baltimore residents who participated in the giveaway would
be entered into a random drawing for a prize.
Twitter. In wave 1, Twitter was used to connect with caregiv-
ers and shared similar content to Facebook and Instagram.
However, we found poor engagement, as local caregivers
were not active Twitter users. The BHCK team learned Bal-
timore policy makers and organizations were more active on
Twitter, so a new Twitter page, "Bmore4kids," was created
for wave 2. It focused on connecting with agencies that had
an interest in changing the food environment and supple-
mented the BHCK policy component.
Boosting and use of hashtags. To increase reach, BHCK paid
to "boost" 1 to 2 posts per week on Facebook near the end of
wave 1 and on all social media platforms during wave 2.
"Boosted" posts display content to a broader preselected
audience: adults ages 18 to 65 in Baltimore City. The BHCK
4 INQUIRY
interventionists also boosted its overall Facebook page and
tracked both paid and organic, meaning via unpaid distribu-
tion, average reach (ie, number of people who saw any activ-
ity from the page) per month. Hashtags are prevalently used
on social media, especially Twitter and Instagram, to catego-
rize and help users find content. Ten BHCK hashtags were
created with 2 hashtags per phase based on the 3 phase slo-
gans used on BHCK communication materials (eg, #Refresh-
BHCK #SnackSmartBHCK) (Supplemental Table S4).
Definitions of Key Process Indicators
Prior to intervention, process evaluation standards were cre-
ated to track implementation quality and make improve-
ments during the program. Multiple reach, dose delivered,
and fidelity indicators were initially developed based on pre-
vious intervention experience,20 and applied to each social
media platform and text messaging, reviewed and refined as
needed during BHCK team meetings (bimonthly). Reach
was defined as the number of followers and impressions, ie,
the number of times the page or post was displayed, or per-
centage of families in the evaluation sample enrolled in the
text-messaging program. Dose delivered accounted for the
number of BHCK posts on social media platforms and text
messages sent. Fidelity was the effectiveness of the text-
messaging and social media components, and measured indi-
rectly through level of engagement that the page, posts, and
texts generated (eg, likes, comments, replies), and follower
retention rate.
Process Evaluation Standards
Reach, dose delivered, and fidelity were measured by 20 pre-
set standards in wave 1 and an expanded set of 68 standards
in wave 2 (Supplemental Tables S5-S7). The BHCK set stan-
dards based on current literature,13,21 and measurement data
available from social media analytical sites. Each standard
could be met at a low, medium, or high level, with high being
the goal to reflect optimum intervention delivery according
to BHCK initial plans. Aiming to improve implementation
for wave 2, ranges for low, medium, and high were increased
(ie, high ranges in wave 1 standards were set as moderate for
wave 2). The BHCK also modified its social media standards
based on lessons learned and experience from wave 1. Due to
the different process evaluation standards used between
waves 1 and 2, this paper evaluates implementation of both
waves using wave 2 standards. Impact results for the BHCK
intervention are presented elsewhere.22
Data Sources and Analysis
TextIt (wave 1), EZ Texting, and MobileVip (wave 2) were
online platforms used to send messages and track process
data (ie, reach, dose, and fidelity). During wave 1, Facebook
Insights, Instagram, and HootSuite were used to track
follower growth and posts on Facebook, Instagram, and
Twitter, respectively. For wave 2, Iconosquare was used for
Instagram and Twitter Analytics for Twitter. Data were mea-
sured on a weekly and monthly basis and reported as an aver-
age at the end of each phase.
Process data were derived from various program applica-
tions and recorded in Microsoft Word and Excel 2011.
Process evaluation data for each platform were computed
separately. All dose, reach, and fidelity standards were calcu-
lated as a percentage of the high standard met so that results
would be comparable with similar interventions. We defined
low, medium, and high as <50%, 50% to 99%, and 100% or
above of the high minimum standard, respectively. Standard
percentages were averaged to calculate total reach, total dose
delivered, and total fidelity for a total wave 1 average across
the phases and an average for each of the 3 BHCK phases in
wave 2 to track the progress of wave 2 implementation
against wave 1.
Results
Reach
Text messaging. Based on wave 2 standards, total reach of the
wave 1 text-messaging program was moderate (Figure 1). Of
the entire intervention evaluation sample, 97% of all caregiv-
ers (n = 150) were successfully invited to join the BHCK
texting program through email, phone call, or letter, with 5
participants unable to be reached due to invalid phone num-
ber, email, or home address. Seventy-two percent (n = 108)
of the wave 1 caregivers enrolled. In wave 2, of 133 caregiv-
ers in the intervention group, 82% enrolled in the texting,
reflecting high reach.
Social media. In wave 1, low to moderate reach was achieved
for new page likes (Facebook) or follower growth (Insta-
gram, Twitter) per month (Table 1). Over the course of wave
2, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter gained an average of
285.5, 403.7, and 105 new page likes or followers per month,
respectively, reflecting high reach. By intervention's end,
Instagram built the largest follower base (n = 4317), fol-
lowed by Facebook and Twitter (Supplemental Table S8).
Wave 2 overall reach for Facebook and Twitter was consis-
tently high--an improvement over the total moderate reach
for both platforms during wave 1. Instagram improved from
low to moderate total reach, meeting 62% of high minimum
standard on average across the 3 phases as compared with
3.8% achieved in wave 1.
Dose Delivered
Text messaging.On average, wave 1 participants in the
2-texts per week group received 2.3 texts per week, and
participants in the 3-to-5 texts per week group received 3.1
texts per week. Moderate total dose delivered was achieved
Loh et al 5
in wave 1 (Figure 2), as goal-setting text messages were
only sent on 10 of 17 weeks. Wave 2 participants received
4.5 texts per week and 1 goal-setting text weekly, achiev-
ing high total dose delivered. Use of MobileVip also
improved text delivery during wave 2, averaging 89.5%
and 91.3% successfully delivered texts per week in phases
2 and 3.
Social media.During wave 1, 9.3, 10.5, and 7.6 posts per
week were made on average to Facebook, Instagram, and
Twitter, respectively, with 18.6, 7.2, and 7.4 posts per week
during wave 2. New social media dose standards were devel-
oped and met during wave 2 to assess delivery of different
post types (ie, video, article discussion, youth leader feature)
to ensure variety and improve engagement. Total dose deliv-
ered improved from moderate to high from wave 1 to 2
across all platforms (Figure 2).
Fidelity
Text messaging. Total fidelity for wave 1 text messaging was
high (Figure 3). Participation retention rate was high, with
87% of initially enrolled caregivers (n = 94) remaining for at
least 6 months (Supplemental Table S8). On average, 26.9%
of participants responded when questions were prompted.
Wave 2 texting achieved moderate fidelity with an averaged
9.5% weekly response rate (Table 1). Overall, 59.5% of fam-
ilies (n = 105) stayed enrolled in the program for at least 6
months, while 96.3% of families remained for at least 2
months. This discrepancy is largely because many partici-
pants were interviewed and invited into the text-messaging
program after overall start of intervention, so they were not
yet enrolled for 6 months by intervention end. Opt-out rate
declined across the 3 phases in wave 2, from 12.1% to 3.1%
and 0%.
Social media. Fidelity was newly defined after wave 1 with
new wave 2 standards set to indirectly measure fidelity
through engagement. Thus, no data were collected for these
standards in wave 1, and social media fidelity was not quan-
tified. Fidelity in wave 2 was consistently high for Facebook,
Instagram, and Twitter (Table 1). On average, Facebook
gained 19 shares, 66.3 reactions, and 3.8 comments per post
per month. Instagram received 60.8 likes and 1.5 comments
per post. Twitter received 34.2 page mentions per month and
67.9 page likes per week.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first community-based obesity
prevention trial to include multiple social media platforms
and text messaging as part of a multi-level, multi-component
intervention, and to report on implementation quality.
Overall, social media implementation improved from low-
to-moderate to high reach, dose delivered, and fidelity
between the 2 waves. Text-messaging implementation
improved to high reach and dose delivered.
A novel component of this study was its measurement of
fidelity. Fidelity is typically defined as quality of delivery--
or a more refined version of dose delivered.23 We chose to
assess fidelity indirectly, as engagement in the target popula-
tion. We quantified engagement by number of likes, com-
ments, and shares associated with each post. This approach
has been used by others.13 Engagement has also been mea-
sured in other ways, including post views21 and link clicks,10
which we instead defined as reach. We deemed engagement
as an action on the viewer's part and used it to assess fidelity,
as social media and texting were created for social network-
ing. Although engagement assessed for BHCK social media
pages included individuals beyond our target audience (as
pages were open to the general public), an overall higher
Figure 1. Social media and text-messaging intervention reach.
Note. The data points were calculated by averaging the percentage of minimum high standard met for all reach standards. Implementation was considered
low for <50% of the high standard. Medium is 50% to 99% of the high standard, high is 100% or above of the high standard. For texting, 2 out of 2 of wave
2 reach standards were analyzed for both wave 1 and wave 2. Based on wave 2 Facebook standards, 1 out of 6 reach standards were analyzed for wave 1;
six out of 6 reach standards for wave 2. Based on wave 2 Instagram standards, 1 out of 2 reach standards were analyzed for wave 1, and 2/2 for wave 2.
For Twitter, 1/6 wave 2 reach standards were analyzed for wave 1 and 6/6 for wave 2.

aTotal reach is the number of unique people who saw any activity from BHCK page, including posts, others' post on BHCK page, page like ads, mentions,
and check-ins. Organic reach is the number of unique people who saw BHCK post through unpaid distribution, whereas paid reach is the total number of
people who saw BHCK post as a result of advertisements.25

engagement level would still reflect improvement in the inter-
vention's fidelity.
The BHCK interventionists found that posting timely and
personalized content (ie, cultural-specific and community-
specific posts, individualized text responses) and encourag-
ing goal-setting and discussion were successful ways to
promote each platform. These techniques were also shown to
be successful in previous mobile-based14,24 and social media
interventions.21
Beyond boosting to increase reach, social networking was
most effective at increasing reach and gaining followers.
Throughout wave 2, BHCK interventionists dedicated time
to like and retweet from relevant Twitter accounts, and join
Twitter chats. The BHCK also made "shout-out" posts for
other accounts on Instagram and Facebook, to feature weekly
challenge winners and connect with other users. Dose deliv-
ered standards were set in wave 2 to track these activities.
Linking social media pages also helped increase reach by
spreading messages to a greater audience. The BHCK
Instagram posts were always linked to Facebook and often to
Twitter. The BHCK interventionists observed increases in
likes and comments on linked posts. However, effectiveness
of different media types varies within platforms. For instance,
hyperlinks cannot be shared on Instagram; Facebook follow-
ers were less likely to watch a video if a link was posted
instead of the video itself.
A limitation found in this study and previous studies16
was that the quantifiable engagement with social media posts

and text messages was not always directly correlated with
behavioral change. Including specific measures for behavior
changes within intervention may help, such as asking users
to post a photo of their home-cooked meal, which BHCK did
as part of its large Instagram challenges.
Another challenge encountered was in assessing percent-
age of the evaluation sample participating in BHCK social
media sites due to individuals' privacy settings and use of
different usernames. To overcome this, BHCK tried to gauge
engagement by using example posts in the dose received
("exposure") evaluation during post-intervention assessment
with study participants.
The BHCK texting response rate was low compared with
another study that received an average 68.5% response rate
to self-monitoring text messages.13 Difference in response
rates was likely due to the sample population age, as their
participants were college students, who are probably more
familiar with texting than BHCK's older caregiver sample
(mean age = 41 years). However, like the study by Napolitano
et al, BHCK participants also reported positive feedback
about receiving health-related text messages.
Finally, changes in standards between waves 1 and 2 pre-
vented comparison between some process evaluation standards.
However, new process evaluation measures were added based
on best practices and lessons learned in wave 1, and ultimately
improved evaluation and implementation during wave 2.
Conclusions
The BHCK showed that social media and text messaging
were innovative tools to include in and increase reach of a
multilevel community intervention. Valuable improvements
in intervention implementation made in wave 2, based on
lessons learned from wave 1, suggest the benefit of imple-
menting the program in 2 waves and conducting detailed
process evaluation. The overall high level of reach and fidel-
ity achieved by end of intervention demonstrated the need
for consistent high dose delivery and community interest in
using social media and text messages to receive and engage
with health-related topics. This study shows the importance
of understanding the target audience's usage of social media
(ie, which platform(s), frequency, peak hours) to maximize
engagement and successfully utilize it as an intervention
tool. Recommended practices for managing social media
sites include boosting, networking with other accounts, and
posting varied and population-relevant content consistently.
In the text-messaging program, use of personalized texts,
goal-oriented messages, and yes-or-no prompt questions
were among the recommended strategies. This work furthers
the field by identifying features that increase engagement
and retention of target audience and detailing an effective
implementation plan and process evaluation standards for
social media and text messaging. Future researchers can
apply these practices in their own interventions to promote
behavior change and improve reach.
