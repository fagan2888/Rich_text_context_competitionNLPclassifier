Although people with diabetes have decreased lung function, the dose-response relation between measures of
glucose control and lung function in nondiabetic people is not known. The authors used data from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994) to investigate the relation between glucose
tolerance test response and other measures of glucose homeostasis and lung function in an adult population
without a clinical diagnosis of diabetes. Plasma glucose level 2 hours after oral administration of 75 g of glucose
was inversely related to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
), with a difference of ÿ144.7 ml (95%
confidence interval: ÿ231.9, ÿ57.4) for persons in the highest quintile of postchallenge glucose compared with
the lowest. Similar inverse associations with FEV1
were found for other measures of glucose autoregulation. Lung
function did not appear to be related to fasting glucose level. Similar associations were seen for forced vital
capacity (FVC) but not for the FEV1
:FVC ratio. In the total study population, persons with previously diagnosed
diabetes had an FEV1
119.1 ml (95% confidence interval: ÿ161.5, ÿ76.6) lower than persons without diabetes.
This effect was greater in those with poorly controlled diabetes. These findings suggest that impaired glucose
autoregulation is associated with impaired lung function.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects up to 24
million people in the United States and is a major cause of
morbidity and mortality (1). Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease is characterized by increased respiratory symptoms
such as cough and phlegm and obstructive airways disease,
as defined by reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second
(FEV1
) and a reduced ratio between FEV1
and forced vital
capacity (FVC) (2). Cigarette smoking is the main risk
factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but other
nutritional and environmental factors may be important,
including those acting early in life, such as low birth weight.
Diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance (3­17) have been
independently associated with impaired lung function, but
what is not known is the dose-response relation between
lung function and response to an oral glucose load in
persons with no clinical diagnosis of diabetes.
The prevalence of smoking is declining and that of
diabetes is increasing, so it is important to understand
the effects of other exposures that may negatively affect
lung function. For this reason, we used data from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) in a population without a diagnosis of
diabetes to investigate the relation between response to
a glucose tolerance test and lung function as measured by
FEV1
and the FEV1
:FVC ratio. We hypothesized that an
increase in markers of impaired glycemic control would be
associated with a reduction in both FEV1
and FEV1
:FVC
ratio.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used data from NHANES III, a survey designed to
examine the health and nutrition of a randomly selected
sample of the noninstitutionalized US population. The
survey was conducted between 1988 and 1994. Full details
on the survey design and examination procedure have been
published by the National Center for Health Statistics (18).
All adults aged 20­60 years were eligible for inclusion in
the analyses. In the main analysis, persons with a known
diagnosis of diabetes (defined as a physician's diagnosis or
the regular use of diabetic medications) were excluded, as
were those with missing data for lung function, plasma
glycemic markers, and potentially confounding variables
(figure 1). However, persons who had undiagnosed diabetes,
as demonstrated by their fasting plasma glucose level or
glucose tolerance test response, were included in the study
population. In addition, to comply with standardized
procedures for the measurement of fasting plasma glucose
level and glucose tolerance testing (19), we included in
these analyses only those participants who had undergone
examination in the morning and had fasted for 8 hours
or more.
Data collection
Blood samples were obtained for biochemical assays, and
anthropometric measurements were taken, including mea-
surement of height and weight and spirometric factors
(including FEV1
and FVC), using standardized techniques.
We extracted data on various markers of glucose regulation,
including levels of fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglo-
bin (hemoglobin A1c), insulin, and C-peptide and, for
people over age 40 years, results of oral glucose tolerance
testing, in which the subject's initial plasma glucose level
was measured at baseline and 2 hours after oral adminis-
tration of 75 g of glucose (Dextolä or Trutolä). Insulin
resistance was calculated from the measurements by means
of a formula devised for use in epidemiologic studies:
fasting glucose (mmol/liter) 3 fasting insulin (lU/ml)/25
(20). A detailed description of laboratory methods has been
published elsewhere (21).
Statistical analyses
The main population studied was persons with no clinical
diagnosis of diabetes. We also studied a larger population
including persons with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes to
assess the impact of diabetes on lung function. Using self-
reported information on smoking history, we classified
subjects as never smokers, ex-smokers, or current smokers
and quantified total cigarette smoking in pack-years. We
modeled measures of lung function with adjustment for
age, sex, height, smoking (status and pack-years), and race/
ethnicity to derive the most parsimonious model that mini-
mized variance. We examined a variety of more complex
models for lung function that included higher-order variables
for age, height, pack-years of smoking, and body mass index
(weight (kg)/height (m)2), including interaction terms, but
these did not improve the fit of the model; therefore, we chose
the simplest model.
Glycemic markers were arbitrarily categorized into
quintiles, and the relations between measures of glycemic
status and lung function were explored using multiple linear
regression. We fitted the models with quintiles of glycemic
markers as both ordered and unordered factors and com-
pared the two models for evidence of departure from
linearity. The p value for linear trend is presented where
there was no departure from linearity, and the p value from
a test of heterogeneity is presented where the data demon-
strated evidence of departure from linearity. Many of the
markers demonstrated nonlinear relations; therefore, the
results are presented in quintiles. We also divided the fasting
blood glucose values according to the World Health
Organization definitions of normal glucose tolerance, im-
paired glucose tolerance, and diabetes (19). Normal values
for fasting plasma glucose are those less than 110 mg/dl;
impaired fasting glucose values are 110­125.99 mg/dl; and

7,045 subjects excluded to meet World Health Organization (WHO)
criteria for glucose tolerance testing, 79% of those who did not meet
the WHO criteria were excluded for having an afternoon or evening
examination, and the remaining 21% were excluded because of
missing data on the time of examination or the period of fasting. FEV1

values equal to or above 126 mg/dl indicate diabetes. The
normal values for plasma glucose 2 hours after a 75-g oral
glucose challenge are those less than 140 mg/dl; values for
impaired glucose tolerance are 140­199.99 mg/dl; and
values equal to or above 200 mg/dl indicate diabetes. The
impact of these clinical definitions of impaired glycemic
control on FEV1
, FVC, and FEV1
:FVC ratio was examined.
We examined a number of confounding factors, such as
body mass index, waist:hip ratio, poverty index ratio, and
levels of serum triglycerides, serum antioxidants, and C-
reactive protein (fitted as continuous or categorical variables
as appropriate), to determine whether they altered the
regression coefficients.
To obtain additional data, we also used the same
modeling strategies to study the effect of a known diagnosis
of diabetes on lung function using all persons with and
without diagnosed diabetes who had data available. In
addition, we examined the impact of the degree of glucose
regulation in persons with known diabetes by stratifying
these persons into two groups defined by a glycosylated
hemoglobin concentration of <7 percent versus 7 percent.
A factor was considered a confounding factor if its addition
to the model changed the size of the effect by 15 percent or
more. Because of the complex, multistage probability
sample design of NHANES III, we accounted for the survey
design in calculating estimates, using the specialized survey
command within Stata/SE 8.0 (Stata Corporation, College
Station, Texas). Because certain age groups and ethnic
groups were oversampled in the NHANES III study
population, we also repeated the analyses using weighting
variables to establish the descriptive population corrected to
be representative of the general US population.
RESULTS
A total of 12,496 adults were eligible for the initial
analyses. Reasons for exclusion are outlined in figure 1. Six
hundred and eighteen (5 percent) of those excluded from the
initial analysis had a clinical diagnosis of diabetes, and 7,045
subjects (56 percent) were excluded because they failed to
meet World Health Organization criteria for glucose testing.
Our study population was similar to the excluded population
in terms of demographic characteristics (table 1). A total of
4,257 participants (34 percent) had data on serum measures
of glucose control, and 1,612 (13 percent) had data on serum
glucose level 2 hours after a glucose load. The mean age of
the population was 37 years; 54 percent were female. The
mean levels and distributions of the various glycemic
markers are presented in table 2.
For the 1,612 participants who had data on glucose
tolerance testing, an inverse dose-response relation with

was found, such that those in the highest quintile of
plasma glucose after oral glucose loading had a decrease of
144.7 ml (95 percent confidence interval (CI): ÿ231.9, ÿ57.4)
compared with those in the lowest quintile (table 3). A
similar relation was seen with increasing fasting insulin,
plasma C-peptide, insulin resistance, and glycosylated
hemoglobin, although there was no clear association
between fasting plasma glucose and FEV1
.
Adjusting the above associations for body mass index (in
categories) and waist:hip ratio slightly decreased these
associations between measures of glucose control and
FEV1
. Adjusting for other possible confounders, such as
plasma antioxidants, vitamins A, C, and E, poverty index
ratio, C-reactive protein, and triglycerides, did not appre-
ciably alter these associations (data not shown). Stratifying
the results according to age did not produce any noticeable
difference in effect across the age categories, and there were
no significant interactions between smoking and glycemic
markers. Restricting the analysis to persons who had never
smoked did not significantly alter these associations.
The relation between glycemic markers and FVC was
similar to the results shown for FEV1
, although the size of
the effect was greater for FVC (table 4). However, no
consistent association was seen between the different
glycemic markers and the FEV1
:FVC ratio (table 5).
When we compared persons with impaired glucose
tolerance and persons who had clinical diabetes defined by
glucose tolerance testing with persons whose values fell
within the normal range, the differences in FEV1
were ÿ34.3
ml (95 percent CI: ÿ114.5, ÿ45.9) and ÿ108.8 ml (95
percent CI: ÿ217.3, ÿ0.3), respectively (table 6). Impaired
fasting glucose and diabetes as defined by fasting glucose
level were associated with decreases in FEV1
of 60.8 ml
(95 percent CI: ÿ95.7, ÿ25.8) and 93.8 ml (95 percent CI:
ÿ127.4, ÿ60.2), respectively. Persons with an elevated
hemoglobin A1c concentration had an associated decrease
in FEV1
of 75.0 ml (95 percent CI: ÿ231.0, 80.9).
In examining the effect of diagnosed diabetes on lung
function, we found that persons with diabetes had a 119.1 ml
(95 percent CI: ÿ161.5, ÿ76.6) reduction in FEV1
in com-
parison with the rest of the population (table 7). Persons
with suboptimal diabetic control, as determined by a glyco-
sylated hemoglobin concentration of 7 percent, had lower
lung function than persons with well-controlled diabetes.
Correction for the selective oversampling of certain age
and ethnic groups in NHANES III using models that
included the weighting variables did not change the
qualitative nature of the results. Correction for weighting
did increase the effect size of the association between
measures of glycemic control and lung function, and it also
increased the confidence intervals in the analyses of
a smaller sample population, as shown in tables 6 and 7.
We thus elected to present the data using the more
conservative regression models derived from the data
available for each eligible individual.
DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated that in adults without a diagnosis
of diabetes, impaired glucose regulation as indicated by
glucose tolerance testing, higher levels of glycosylated
hemoglobin, plasma insulin (a marker of insulin resistance
(22)), and C-peptide (a by-product of insulin production),
and an epidemiologic measure of insulin resistance are
associated with impaired lung function in a dose-response
manner. However, fasting plasma glucose was not associ-
ated with lung function. We have also demonstrated that
persons with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes have impaired
lung function, a finding that is consistent with previous work
in this area (3­17). These findings were not explained by
obesity or increasing age. This relation was seen throughout
the nondiabetic values of these markers of glucose auto-
regulation, which suggests that the relation between glucose
and lung function is not just an association seen in persons
with overt diabetes. A similar association was also seen
between glycemic markers and FVC but was not seen
consistently with the FEV1
:FVC ratio; this suggests that the
effect is primarily an effect on lung function and does not
influence the development of obstructive lung disease (as
seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
The strength of this study was the use of biologic markers
of glycemic control and physiologic measurements of lung
function in a well-defined population with no clinical
diagnosis of diabetes and no knowledge of the hypothesis
being tested. NHANES III had a high participation rate,
with 86 percent and 78 percent of those invited to participate
in the questionnaire survey and the medical examination,
respectively, taking part (18). However, the population
studied for the effect of fasting glucose, C-peptide, insulin

resistance, and response to glucose tolerance testing was
a subsample of the original NHANES III population, since
we excluded some participants in order to comply with
standardized conditions for collecting the samples (19)
(including only those who had attended a morning exam-
ination and had fasted for 8 hours or more). It is unlikely that
those who were included in this group had lower lung
function than those who did not fast for 8 hours or
underwent examination in the afternoon. We do have to
consider the potential for confounding, especially by
smoking, antioxidants, and early life development. Because
an association between smoking and diabetes has been
demonstrated (23, 24), smoking status may confound the
relation between impaired glycemic control and lung
function (25). However, we rigorously adjusted for self-
reported smoking history using both current smoking status
and total pack-years of smoking, additionally restricting our
analysis to persons who had never smoked, and this did not
alter our findings. Another risk factor that is associated with
both diabetes (26) and reduced lung function (27) is

antioxidant status, although adjustment for serum vitamin C
and vitamin E levels did not alter our findings.
One potentially confounding factor, which we are unable
to exclude, is growth in early life. An association has been
demonstrated between low body weight in early life and
impaired glucose control, insulin resistance (28, 29), and
decreased lung function (30). It is thus possible that our
apparent association between poor glucose regulation and
reduced lung function is a consequence of confounding by
growth in early life, although no effect of birth weight on
lung function was reported in a recent study (9). Alterna-
tively, it may be that poor glycemic control lies within the
causal pathway explaining the association between low birth
weight and decreased lung function. The use of data from
a cross-sectional study such as NHANES III does not permit
temporal relations to be considered; therefore, we cannot
exclude the possibility of reverse causality--that is, lower
lung function's leading to impaired glucose regulation.
The absence of an effect of fasting plasma glucose on
FEV1
in the presence of a negative effect of increasing
levels of other markers of poor glycemic control is
anomalous and difficult to explain. Over 95 percent of our
study population was in the nondiabetic ranges for fasting
plasma glucose, and we theorize that there may be greater
random variation of fasting plasma glucose within these
levels, while the other measures of glycemic control provide
a more consistent measure of glycemic control. Although
we have been unable to find data in the literature to
substantiate this, the association of a gradient of decreasing
FEV1
among persons with fasting plasma glucose levels in
the ``impaired'' or diabetic ranges (table 4) demonstrates
a consistency with the rest of the data, suggesting that this
may be the case. The mechanism by which impaired
glycemic control may lead to a reduction in lung function
is uncertain, though it has been suggested that the increased
systemic inflammation associated with diabetes (31) may
result in pulmonary inflammation (4) and hence airway
damage (32). Alternatively, a reduction in antioxidant
defenses resulting from increased oxidative activity associ-
ated with diabetes (26) may lead to a secondary reduction in
the antioxidant defenses of the lung and hence increased
susceptibility to environmental oxidative insults, resulting
in subsequent loss of lung function. In addition to an
increase in intracellular oxidative stress, increased nuclear
factor-jB, and inflammatory mediator expression, long-
term hyperglycemia causes an increase in collagen molecule
synthesis and cross-linking via the accumulation of ad-
vanced glycosylation end products, which may also ad-
versely influence lung function (33). The observation that
increasing insulin level and insulin resistance is associated
with loss of lung function suggests that insulin may have
a direct negative effect on airway function (34).
The initial studies of diabetes and lung function were
small and had little statistical power, which may explain
why the results were inconsistent (6­8, 35­42). The
subsequent larger population-based studies have been
more coherent, demonstrating reduced pulmonary func-
tion in persons with an elevated plasma glucose level and
a diagnosis of diabetes. Enright et al. (43) reported a small
reduction in FEV1
of 23 ml among persons with diabetes
in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Analysis of 3,254
members of the Framingham Offspring Cohort showed
associations of both diagnosed diabetes and elevated
plasma glucose with reduced FEV1
(4). The results
demonstrated that persons with diabetes had an FEV1
61
ml lower than that of persons without diabetes and that
persons in the highest quartile of plasma glucose had an
FEV1
85 ml lower than that of persons in the lowest quartile
(4). The cross-sectional data from the Copenhagen City
Heart Study demonstrated a reduction in FEV1
of 239 ml
among diabetics who required insulin and a reduction of
117 ml among diabetics treated with oral hypoglycemic
agents (3) in comparison with nondiabetics. In an analy-
sis of persons without diagnosed diabetes, an inverse
association was observed between an elevated nonfasting
plasma glucose level (200 mg/dl) and lung function;
there was a difference in FEV1
of ÿ218 ml in comparison
with persons with normal fasting plasma glucose levels
(3). The longitudinal analyses of the same population
demonstrated an association between a new diagnosis of
diabetes and impaired pulmonary function, with the newly
diagnosed diabetics having an annual decrease in FEV1
of
25 ml more than control subjects (44). A similar increased
decline in lung function among persons with poor diabetic
control has been reported elsewhere (45), although follow-
up at 15 years demonstrated that the decline in FEV1
among those with diabetes was the same as that among
those without the disease. Similarly, in the Normative
Aging Study, Lazarus et al. (10) demonstrated an associ-
ation between decreased FEV1
and increased insulin
resistance, although persons with lower baseline lung
function were observed to be more likely to develop
insulin resistance 20 years later (11)--a result that was
also seen for the development of diabetes elsewhere (46).
However, these relations were not seen in analysis of
adults aged 51­95 years in the Rancho Bernardo Study
(47), where lung function was not associated with fasting
blood glucose level; this may have been a consequence of
studying an older population. Interestingly, a small cohort
study of 18 subjects with type I diabetes who were using
an insulin pump to achieve normoglycemia in comparison
with conventional therapy suggested that intensive insulin
treatment, and hence better glycemic control, may pre-
serve pulmonary function, although the absence of
baseline pulmonary function measurements limited the
interpretation of these data (48).
We have demonstrated that increases in the glucose
response to a glucose tolerance test, glycosylated hemoglo-
bin, serum insulin, and a marker of insulin resistance are all
associated with a reduction in lung function as assessed by
FEV1
(and FVC). This effect is not explained by confound-
ing due to obesity. The observation that persons with
diagnosed diabetes that is poorly controlled have worse
lung function than persons with diagnosed diabetes who
have good glucose control is consistent with the hypothesis
that good control of diabetes is associated with preserved
lung function. Further understanding of the effect of glucose
regulation on the lungs would be obtained by assessing lung
function in participants from a trial of intensive glucose
regulation, such as the Diabetes Control and Complications

Trial, where beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathy are
seen 7­8 years after the end of the intervention (49).
Although smoking is the main risk factor for loss of lung
function, there is an urgent need to understand other factors
that contribute to a reduction in lung function, as demon-
strated by the 95 percent excess mortality among persons
who have never smoked but have reduced lung function in
comparison with those with normal lung function (50). In
addition, the emergence of novel risk factors such as
hyperglycemia will lead to increased understanding of the
pathogenesis of worse lung function and hence new
possibilities for intervention. In view of the public health
importance of lung function in health and the increasing
prevalence of diabetes, this is a subject that warrants further
investigation.
