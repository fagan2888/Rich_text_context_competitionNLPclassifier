Abstract
Background: Debate is ongoing about what role, if any, variation in the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic
region (5-HTTLPR) plays in depression. Some studies report an interaction between 5-HTTLPR variation and stressful
life events affecting the risk for depression, others report a main effect of 5-HTTLPR variation on depression, while
others find no evidence for either a main or interaction effect. Meta-analyses of multiple studies have also reached
differing conclusions.
Methods/Design: To improve understanding of the combined roles of 5-HTTLPR variation and stress in the
development of depression, we are conducting a meta-analysis of multiple independent datasets. This coordinated
approach utilizes new analyses performed with centrally-developed, standardized scripts. This publication
documents the protocol for this collaborative, consortium-based meta-analysis of 5-HTTLPR variation, stress,
and depression.
Study eligibility criteria: Our goal is to invite all datasets, published or unpublished, with 5-HTTLPR genotype and
assessments of stress and depression for at least 300 subjects. This inclusive approach is to minimize potential
impact from publication bias.
Data sources: This project currently includes investigators from 35 independent groups, providing data on at least
N = 33,761 participants.
The analytic plan was determined prior to starting data analysis. Analyses of individual study datasets will be
performed by the investigators who collected the data using centrally-developed standardized analysis scripts to
ensure a consistent analytical approach across sites. The consortium as a group will review and interpret the
meta-analysis results.
Discussion: Variation in 5-HTTLPR is hypothesized to moderate the response to stress on depression. To test
specific hypotheses about the role of 5-HTTLPR variation on depression, we will perform coordinated meta-analyses
of de novo results obtained from all available data, using variables and analyses determined a priori. Primary
analyses, based on the original 2003 report by Caspi and colleagues of a GxE interaction will be supplemented by
secondary analyses to help interpret and clarify issues ranging from the mechanism of effect to heterogeneity
among the contributing studies. Publication of this protocol serves to protect this project from biased reporting
and to improve the ability of readers to interpret the results of this specific meta-analysis upon its completion.

Introduction
Large-scale, collaborative meta-analysis has the potential
to clarify complex scientific questions by increasing
sample size, harmonizing variables, and conducting uni-
form analyses. In this paper, we describe the protocol for
a collaborative, consortium-based meta-analysis to in-
crease understanding of the role of 5-HTTLPR variation
and stress in depression. The publication of this protocol
serves several important purposes. First, we document
our study protocols, design, and primary analysis deci-
sions prior to conducting and publishing our study of 5-
HTTLPR variation, stress, and depression, which will
avoid biased reporting later. Second, publication of these
details will improve the ability of other researchers to in-
terpret the results of this specific meta-analysis upon its
completion. Finally, publishing our detailed protocol
may be helpful to future consortia by detailing key ana-
lysis strategies and as a standard for transparency and
commitment to analytic plans set prior to meta-analysis.
Background
Both genetic and environmental factors influence depres-
sion [1]. As with other psychiatric illnesses, research on the
etiology of depression has identified moderate heritability
estimates of 40-50% [1-6], yet recent genome-wide associ-
ation studies (GWAS) have so far been unable to identify
robust and replicable loci associated with depression [7]. It
has been argued that some of this `missing heritability' is a
result of particular genes exerting an influence on risk for
depression only under specific environmental conditions,
or `gene-environment interactions (GxE) [8,9]. One of the
most high profile reports of GxE involves a common func-
tional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the promoter region
of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT). This gene en-
codes an integral membrane protein that transports the
neurotransmitter serotonin from synaptic spaces into pre-
synaptic neurons, which terminates the action of serotonin.
The repeat length polymorphism has been shown to affect
the rate of serotonin uptake [10]. Specifically, the short (S)
allele of the 5-HTTLPR is associated with less transcrip-
tional efficiency of the promoter compared to the long (L)
allele [11]. Additionally, a single nucleotide substitution
(rs25531, A > G) within both alleles reduces transcription
so that the LG
allele becomes functionally equivalent to the
S allele [12,13]. Studies have suggested grouping LG
with
the S allele to increase efficiency in predicting variation in
serotonin transporter expression [14], although not all
agree on this point.
In 2003, Caspi and colleagues reported evidence of a
G×E interaction between 5-HTTLPR variation and
stressful life events on depression [15], with nearly 5000
citations to date. Carriers of either one or two copies of
the S allele of the 5-HTTLPR were reported to be more
likely to develop major depressive disorder, increased
depressive symptoms, and suicidality in response to
stressful life events and, separately, child maltreatment
than individuals homozygous for the L allele. Further-
more, there was evidence of a dose­response relation-
ship, with risk of depression highest amongst those with
two copies of the S allele compared to individuals with
only one copy in the presence of stress.
In the original report, no main effect of genotype was
found. If the genotype exerts an effect only on those
exposed to the stressor, i.e. a diathesis-stress model, the
lack of main effect may be due to insufficient power
[16]. Alternatively, the genotypic effect may be one
of differential environmental susceptibility [17], in which
the L-carriers are indifferent to the environment, whereas
the S allele confers environmental susceptibility, allowing
S carriers to benefit more from positive experiences as
well as being more sensitive to stress, resulting in no
net genotype-depression association irrespective of sample
size [18]. Studying a large sample may distinguish these
possibilities.
Since the original report of a GxE interaction, hun-
dreds of studies have investigated the combined impact
of 5-HTTLPR variation and stress on risk for depression,
some of which reported replicating the original findings,
while some did not. Meta-analyses, also, have come to
quite different conclusions [16,19-22] and various reasons
for these differences have been proposed [21,23-25].
Below we discuss 4 key factors that complicate the in-
terpretation of existing results related to the interplay
between 5-HTTLPR variation, stress and depression.
1. Study design. One factor complicating interpretation
is differences in study design. Sample sizes vary, with
the majority modest or small. Underpowered studies,
combined with potential publication bias, can lead to
an increased risk of Type 1 errors [26]. Sampling
strategies vary from population-based methods [15,27]
to convenience sampling [28,29]. Different ancestral
populations have been included, with a preponderance
of samples of European ancestry. The age range of
subjects varies, and it has been suggested that GxE
effects are most consistently replicated in young adult
samples [18].
The studies contributing to our meta-analysis
represent a range of study designs, so we will test
whether differing study design contributes to the
heterogeneity of results.
2. Timing of measurements. Brown and Harris [19]
noted that studies that have failed to replicate the
GxE between 5-HTTLPR variation and life events
have measured the occurrence of stressful life events
in the months immediately preceding the depressive
outcomes [19]. In contrast, most of the positive rep-
lications have been in keeping with the original study
Culverhouse et al. BMC Psychiatry 2013, 13:304 Page 2 of 12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/13/304
by Caspi and colleagues in measuring life events in
the five years prior to the outcome. Retrospective
recall of adversity over long periods of time may
increase the risk of forgetting or discounting of
events [30] or lead to a bias due to selective recall
when those who are depressed self report [27,31].
When only a lifetime diagnosis of depression is
available, information about relative timing of
stressors and depression is lost.
Longitudinal studies are largely able to avoid this
bias, so our test of longitudinal vs. cross-sectional
designs will also, in part, address the issue of timing
of stress and depression.
3. Type of environmental stressor. Different stressors
have been examined for interaction with 5-HTTLPR
variation. The most common are broad measures of
stressful life events [32,33] and exposure to child
maltreatment [34,35]. The method of measurement
(self report vs. interviewer), the type of stressors
(e.g. chronic vs. acute) and the scale (binary ex-
posed vs. not exposed, frequency as in the original
study, or continuous variable) also vary. It has been
suggested that the varied methodology in assessing
stressful life events in GxE studies may in part
explain the inconsistency of findings [18], and in a
meta-analysis that differentiated between stressors
(child maltreatment, specific stressors, and stressful
life events), significant differences between types of
stressors were found.
We will therefore perform heterogeneity analyses to
account for different types of stressors and
measurements of stressors. One such test will be to
compare results from the studies that focused on
specific stressors (e.g. pregnancy, heart attack, medical
internship) to those from studies based on summary
measures of diverse stressors (e.g. the LTE-Q).
4. Type of outcome. Some studies used a categorical
measure of depression diagnosis (e.g. DSM-IV or the
ICD-10) as an outcome, others used a symptom
count as continuous outcome, and some used both.
Such differences in outcome measures (e.g., continuous
versus categorical) result in different assumptions
and analytical approaches being used (see for a
Discussion [36]).
The role of 5-HTTLPR variation and stress in the
development of depression remains a topic of active
debate, in part because of the challenges outlined
above. Therefore, we are undertaking this collabora-
tive meta-analysis using a standardized protocol to
improve understanding of this important issue.
Study objectives
The primary objective of this study is to increase under-
standing of the role of 5-HTTLPR variation and stress in
depression, where 5-HTTLPR variation is hypothesized
as a moderator of the response to stress. To address the
complexities of this topic, we will perform a coordinated
meta-analysis of all data available from collaborators,
using consistent de novo analyses and variables deter-
mined a priori.
In keeping with the original finding by Caspi and col-
leagues [15], we will test the following main hypothesis.
The risk of depression, evaluated either as a dichotom-
ous diagnosis or as a continuous phenotype, is greater in
carriers of the S allele versus those homozygous for the
L allele in the presence of exposure to stress.
This main hypothesis will be examined in multiple set-
tings to determine a range of conditions under which
the effect might be found. Additional hypotheses (e.g.
whether there is a main effect of 5-HTTLPR variation
on depression) will be examined to improve our under-
standing of this complex topic.
Methods/Design
Overview
Plans for analysis, definitions of stressors and outcomes,
as laid out in this protocol, were determined a priori by
our study leadership team in consultation with contrib-
uting study investigators, who provided input via confer-
ence calls and email. Individual study analyses will be
performed by the investigators who collected the data,
using standardized analysis scripts developed by the co-
ordinating team at Washington University to implement
a consistent analytical approach across sites. Results from
these analyses will be sent to the coordinating team for
meta-analysis. The consortium as a group will review and
interpret the results. We have previously developed and
successfully implemented this collaborative meta-analysis
approach to investigate the genetics of addiction [37-39].
This coordinated meta-analysis approach has several ad-
vantages over traditional literature-based meta-analyses
arising from the fact that a collaborative meta-analysis is
based on de novo, consistent analyses of harmonized vari-
ables in the primary data. First, the consistent analytic ap-
proach and harmonized variables greatly ameliorate the
effects of two of the chief causes of heterogeneity between
individual studies. In particular, meta-analyzing results de-
rived from differing analytic approaches, such as the use
of different covariates, different phenotype definitions, and
different analytical models, has a clear potential to bias
literature-based meta-analyses [40]. Second, the fact that
the results are based on de novo analyses allows for the in-
clusion of previously unpublished data, both from re-
searchers who have not published on the topic before and
through updated individual data from research groups
who have previously published. Third, coordinated de
novo analyses of primary data allow a collaborative meta-
analysis to conduct secondary analyses that can aid in the
Culverhouse et al. BMC Psychiatry 2013, 13:304 Page 3 of 12

interpretation of the main results. Finally, the coordinated
meta-analysis approach allows the examination of more
homogeneous subsets of the primary data than is possible
through literature review.
Identifying studies
Our goal is to invite participation from all studies with
datasets that have the 5-HTTLPR variant genotyped,
and assessments of stress and depression, on at least 300
subjects. We set a minimum study size anticipating that
the individuals available for our de novo analyses would
typically be only a subset of the study individuals. Setting
an arbitrary study minimum was intended to improve
the balance between the heterogeneity introduced by a
new study and the increased sample size. It also had the
potential to ameliorate bias due to a possible publication
bias amongst small studies. One drawback to this ap-
proach of requiring large sample size is that it may ex-
clude some studies with the most intensive assessments
of stress and depression. Invitations were sent to groups
that had previously published on the topic. Additional
invitations were sent to groups, published or unpub-
lished on this topic, suggested as a potentially qualifying
study by a participating group. The goal of this inclusive
approach is to minimize the potential impact of publica-
tion bias. The participating collaborative studies are
listed in Table 1. All participating studies have approval
from their local boards governing ethical conduct of re-
search in human subjects to conduct the agreed upon
statistical analyses. A list of the review boards can be
found in the acknowledgements. Additional groups that
have been invited, but for a variety of reasons are not
currently participating, are identified by publications
listed in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Inclusion criteria:
 5-HTTLPR variant genotyped.
 Measurement of exposure to stress (including
stressful life events and/or maltreatment).
 Measurement of depression (including symptom
counts and/or diagnosis).
 Study sample size of 300 or more.
Exclusion criteria:
 Studies where the 5-HTTLPR variant was not
directly genotyped.
 Studies with a sample size of less than 300
participants.
Data management, analysis, and meta-analysis
Multiple existing, independent datasets will contribute
de novo analysis results for meta-analysis, following co-
ordinated meta-analysis protocols we have developed
and implemented previously [37-39]. Extensive meetings
between the leaders of the contributing studies have fo-
cused on effective ways to harmonize the available vari-
ables across the studies (see "Data Harmonization"
below) to minimize heterogeneity across the resulting
analyses. Following the common protocol, each contrib-
uting group will format their data for analysis by a com-
mon analysis script. Analyses will be performed by each
individual data contributing site, using standardized
scripts developed by the coordinating site at Washington
University in consultation with the entire consortium.
Beta-testing of these scripts will be performed both by
the coordinating team and individual study teams.
These scripts will ensure consistent analyses across
sites. Results will be returned to the coordinating site
for meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analyses will be
interpreted by the consortium and a collaborative publica-
tion reporting the results will be produced.
Quality control
The data contributing sites will be responsible for check-
ing the quality of their formatted data (e.g., making sure
that values for all variables are credible, confirming the
sample size, and checking the number of missing obser-
vations for each variable) prior to analysis and in the re-
sults returned to the coordinating site. The coordinating
site will review the results and work out any anomalies
with the data providers, and perform meta-analyses.
Data harmonization
Differences in assessment of stress and depression and
information regarding the timing of stress and depres-
sion, is a major challenge for effectively combining the
information from the participating studies. The process
of data harmonization began with surveys of the contrib-
uting studies to determine what key variables were avail-
able in each dataset. Based on this information, the
consortium judiciously balanced the effort of trying to
include as many studies as possible against the most ap-
propriate variables for analysis. Below we describe the
two key variables and approaches selected for study.
1. Depression: Many different assessments and
evaluations are available for study. Differences in
measurement of depression may influence the
association results, and as a result, a thorough
review of the best measurement to be used in this
study was undertaken.
The primary phenotype selected for analysis is a
major depressive disorder defined by DSM-IV cri-
teria. This phenotype is one used in the original [15]
paper. Additional analyses will be completed using
DSM-IV major depressive disorder symptom count,
again as in keeping with the original study.
Culverhouse et al. BMC Psychiatry 2013, 13:304 Page 4 of 12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/13/304
Across the majority of the current contributing
datasets, a lifetime diagnosis of DSM-IV major de-
pressive disorder was assessed. For studies where
DSM-IV definition of major depressive disorder is
not available, a proxy diagnosis will be used. We
will track the assessment used and if a proxy diag-
nostic variable is used, we will examine potential
biases introduced by assessment heterogeneity.

2. Stress: The studies vary widely on the types of
assessments of stress and on the relative timing of
the stressful event and the onset of depression. This
study will examine two main stress assessments: a
narrowly focused stressor, childhood maltreatment
(most frequently used assessment among our
participating groups: the Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire (CTQ) [41]), and a broader defined
stressor class, lifetime stressful events (most
frequently used assessment: the List of Threatening
Events (LTE) [42]). A second dimension we will
investigate is timing of stress exposure relative to the
assessment of depression. Some analyses will require
that timing is known, while others will be broadened
to include datasets where the timing is uncertain. A
comprehensive list of the stress variables used in the
analyses can be found in Additional file 2: Table S2.
We will test our hypotheses in two models, the first
using data from a well-characterized, narrowly de-
fined set of subjects selected to most closely resem-
ble those used in the original study by [15] (young
adults with no prior history of depression), and a
more broadly defined group of subjects.
Heterogeneity
Data harmonization requires compromises, and some
heterogeneity and biases will surely remain. We will ad-
dress this issue and improve the interpretation of our
primary analyses by testing for heterogeneity across a
variety of factors and examining results within and
across more homogeneous subsets.
A priori group comparisons for heterogeneity will in-
clude the following:
 Longitudinal versus cross-sectional studies.
 Different measures of depression (DSM-IV criteria
and other measures).
 Different stress exposure scales.
 Interview versus questionnaire reports.
 Self-report versus report by others.
Should heterogeneity be detected, we will report meta-
analysis results from homogeneous subgroups as well as
results based on all available data. Assessment of hetero-
geneity across groups of studies and meta-analyses of
sub-groups of studies will be carried out by the coordin-
ating team.
Analysis models
In our exploration of the relationship between 5-HTTLPR
variation, stress, and depression, we will try to determine
(1) settings in which an effect can be identified and (2) the
extent to which an effect can be generalized.
In the original report by Caspi and colleagues [15], a
depression outcome at age 26 was assessed using the
Diagnostic Interview Schedule [43], yielding a diagnosis
of a major depressive episode according to DSM-IV cri-
teria, as well as a continuous measure of depressive
symptoms. Stressful life events occurring over a five-
year period were assessed retrospectively when study
members were aged 26. Subjects with a diagnosis of de-
pression prior to the five-year window were excluded.
Stressful events were summed to create a five-level or-
dinal variable (no life events, one, two, three, and four
or more events). Exposure to childhood maltreatment
was also examined at three levels (no, probable, and
likely maltreatment).
Analyses involved both a logistic regression (multi-
plicative) model where depression diagnosis was the out-
come, and an ordinal least squares regression (additive)
model of depressive symptoms. No main effect of geno-
type was found.
As stated above, our analyses will fall into two main
groups of data: a well-characterized, narrowly defined
set of subjects similar to those included in the original
study, and a broadly defined group of subjects. Each of
these groups will be investigated based on two stressor
classes: narrow (childhood maltreatment ­ including
physical and sexual abuse as well as physical neglect oc-
curring before age 17) and broad (any lifetime stressful
events (e.g. death of family member, job loss, assault, life
threatening illness)). The first group of subjects will con-
sist of adults aged 21 to 30, who did not have depression
prior to a 5-year window before assessment, and for
whom stress exposure is known to have occurred before
any current depression. Other than childhood maltreat-
ment, lifetime stressful events will only be considered if
they occurred no more than 5 years prior to assessment.
The second, broader group of subjects will have no age
restriction. Examination of the broader group of subjects
will include additional analyses which drop requirements
related to the timing of the stressors.
Using these approaches, we intend to balance the com-
peting factors affecting power: sample size and purity of
assessments. Analyses of the first class of subjects are de-
signed to most closely match the original report of [15].
By examining the more severe stressor, childhood mal-
treatment, in a larger sample with no age restriction, our
goal is to potentially increase our ability to see the influ-
ence of 5-HTTLPR variation if the effect is not limited
young adulthood. Our broadest analysis, with stress
broadly defined in the largest population, can be expected
to maximize power if there is a general effect of 5-
HTTLPR variation moderating the impact of stress expos-
ure on depression. If we do not see the influence of 5-
HTTLPR variation in this final set of analyses, but it was
present in at least one of the previous analyses, we will be
Culverhouse et al. BMC Psychiatry 2013, 13:304 Page 6 of 12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/13/304
able to examine which factors reduce the effect of the as-
sociation. An important benefit of this design is that we
will also examine the degree to which results observed
with narrower analyses generalize to the broader analyses,
which provides the opportunity to clarify the importance
of specific phenotype, stressor, and age requirements.
Under this protocol, data from a particular study may
be appropriate for inclusion in one or more of these ana-
lysis categories.
Plan details
The primary model of interest, a focused analysis of 5-
HTTLPR variation, consists of two arms (arms A and B)
and most closely follows the original report. The
analysis scripts will also include pre-specified secondary
analyses aimed to aid additional understanding of
the primary analysis results and to explore secondary
hypotheses.
Primary analysis 1: analysis of the impact of 5-HTTLPR
variation in young adults
In keeping with the original study and following reports
that effects of any GxE may be expected to be greatest
among young adults [18], we will first restrict our analyses
to individuals with outcome measures at age 21­30 years.
Two arms differentiated by stressor will be the co-
primary foci for this set of analyses.
Arm A: childhood maltreatment
 Narrower Stressor
 No time limit on gap between maltreatment and
depression
 Stress exposure assumed to occur before depression,
but need not be documented
Childhood maltreatment has been reported as a particu-
lar stressor of interest for understanding the relationship
between 5-HTTLPR variation and depression. The effects
of childhood maltreatment were deemed by the consor-
tium members to have long-lasting adverse effects. As a
consequence, no time limit between exposure to child-
hood maltreatment and adult depression outcome will be
required. This is also in keeping with the original study.
Furthermore, these analyses will assume that childhood
maltreatment antedates the development of depression, so
specific timing of when the maltreatment occurred rela-
tive to any depressive episodes will not be required.
Arm B: stressful life events (including childhood maltreatment)
 Broader Stressor
 Stressors other than childhood maltreatment must
occur < 5 years prior to assessment
The second arm will take a broader measure of stress,
incorporating both stressful life events and maltreatment
history. Because stressful life events other than child-
hood maltreatment were deemed as less likely to have a
lifelong impact, for this analysis, only life stressors
occurring within 5 years of the outcome measure will be
used. Furthermore, in order to elucidate the issue of
causation in the event that an association is observed, only
data in which the relative timing of exposure to stressful
life events and depression outcome is known will be used.
Individuals with a history of depression prior to stress
exposure will be excluded from these analyses.
Key covariates
Several covariates may alter the relationship between 5-
HTTLPR variation, stress, and depression. Effects due to
sex, age, birth cohort, and genetic ancestry will be inves-
tigated in our analysis.
Sex
Analyses stratified by sex and using sex as a covariate
will be conducted.
Age
Age at interview will be included as a covariate in the
primary analyses.
Birth cohort
Cohort effects will be examined using decade of birth as
a covariate. The primary models will not include birth
cohort as a covariate.
Genetic ancestry
Our analyses will stratified by genetic ancestry (European,
Asian, African, Pacific Island, and Admixed European-
African). The majority of data is from participants of
European ancestry and there may be limited power to
detect ethnic heterogeneity in the results. If there is suffi-
cient power to effectively test for heterogeneity and none
is found, then a meta-analysis across all ancestry groups
will be evaluated.

In this analysis, model fit using a likelihood ratio
test is compared with and without the interaction
term to evaluate whether there is statistically signifi-
cant evidence for the interaction. Our primary ana-
lysis will use an additive coding for genotype based
on the number of S alleles carried and lifetime diag-
nosis of depression.
Secondary analyses will evaluate whether alternate
codings for genotype (such as adding a dominance fac-
tor) provide a significantly better fit to the data and the

G = 5-HTTLPR genotype.
This analysis will parallel the description of Model
1A1.
Arm B analysis
Analysis Models 1B1 and 1B2 will be analogous to 1A1
and 1A2, but substituting stressful life events, S, as the
stressor. Stressors other than childhood maltreatment
must have occurred no more than 5 years prior to the
assessment of depression to be included.
These two arms of Primary Analysis 1 will most
closely replicate the analyses in the original report. If, as
has been suggested, the GxE effect is strongest for child-
hood maltreatment [19] or is seen primarily in young
adults following recent stress exposure [18] this set of
analyses will maximize statistical power.
Primary analysis 2: analysis of the impact of 5-HTTLPR
variation across all ages
Our second set of primary analyses will involve larger
sample sizes, including children and adults of all ages.
The increase in sample size will result in increased
power if there is a broad genetic association between 5-
HTTLPR genotypes, stress, and depression. However,
this comes at a cost; in these analyses, we give up the
opportunity to investigate whether stress preceding de-
pression was a potential cause of the depression, as rela-
tive timing of stress and depression may not be known,
and thus will not be included in the models.
Parallel to Primary Analysis 1, these analyses will also
utilize two co-primary arms differentiated by stressor.
Arm A: childhood maltreatment
 Narrower Stressor.
 No time limit on gap between maltreatment and
depression.
 Stress exposure assumed to occur before depression,
but need not be documented.
As noted above, childhood maltreatment has been re-
ported as a particular stressor of interest for understand-
ing the relationship between 5-HTTLPR variation and
depression. This portion of the analysis differs from the
first primary analysis Arm A in that there is no limit on
the ages of the subjects at the time of interview.
Arm B: stressful life events (including childhood maltreatment)
 Broader Stressor
 Stressors occurring < 5 years prior to assessment
when information available.
 Stressor timing unknown will not be reason for
exclusion.
This arm of the analyses will include a series of nested
analyses. The first will be similar to Arm B of the first
primary analyses, except that there is no restriction on
the ages of the subjects. Additional analyses will further
reduce the restrictions on the included data (e.g. timing
need not be known) as we attempt to determine what
are the broadest general conditions under which an ef-
fect can be detected. As we loosen the restrictions, the
sample size will increase allowing the possibility of de-
tecting weaker associations in a broader setting.
Statistical models for primary analysis 2
These analyses will consist of 3 sets of analyses nested
based on the subjects that are included.
Analysis models 2A1a through 2B2a
These are identical to Models 1A1 through 1B2 except
that subjects are not restricted to be between age 21
and 30.
Analysis models 2B1b and 2B2b
These are identical to Models 2A1a through 2B2a ex-
cept that the timing of the stressful life events relative
to depression may be unknown. (Because childhood
maltreatment is assumed to occur prior to the first
major depressive episode, there are no models 2A1b
and 2A2b.)

Analysis model 2C
Our broadest analysis will estimate allele frequencies
among the cells of a 2×2 table defined by stress exposure
and lifetime diagnosis of major depression, followed by a
determination of whether there is evidence of a direct or
interaction association between 5-HTTLPR variation
and depression.
Secondary models
As noted above, in addition to the moderated regres-
sion models described in the 11 primary analysis
models (1A1 through 2C), we will examine a variety
of secondary models to help us interpret the results
of our primary results. Included in these will be
analyses where only stresses other than childhood
maltreatment are considered. Secondary analyses will
also include both alternate statistical models and
analyses of more narrowly defined subsets of subjects
(e.g. subjects from longitudinal studies, subjects for
which the SNP occurring on the L allele has been
genotyped).
Among these secondary analyses will be traditional lo-
gistic and linear regression models parallel to the moder-
ated regression models 1A1 through 2B2b but without
the interaction terms, as illustrated below.

Results from previous studies (e.g. [16]) suggest that
there is likely no main effect of 5-HTTLPR variation on
depression and as a result, this is not part of our primary
analysis. Nonetheless, our secondary analyses will evalu-
ate the possibility of a main effect, both in isolation and
as part of larger interaction models (cf. models S1A1
and S1B1 above) for completeness.
Variables included in the analysis datasets
Additional file 2: Table S2 is a comprehensive list of the
variables used in the analyses. The studies will generally
contain only a subset of the complete list and therefore
each dataset will participate in only a subset of the pro-
posed analyses. In addition to the variables contained in
the datasets, we will gather additional information about
the datasets to allow us to evaluate particular sources of
heterogeneity through meta-analyses of refined subsets
of the datasets.
Variables gathered about each dataset:
1. Genetic ancestry (datasets are stratified by ancestry).
2. Cross-sectional or longitudinal.
3. Information gathered via interview or questionnaire.
4. Information on stress and depression is based on
current or lifetime reports.
Additional secondary analyses
As indicated above, a variety of secondary, interpretive
analyses are planned. In addition to the alternate geno-
type codings and covariates listed above, tests of het-
erogeneity between datasets are expected to lead to
secondary meta-analyses of results from more homoge-
neous datasets. In particular, it has been argued that
many studies that have failed to replicate the original
studies lacked in-depth environmental measures [30].
We will investigate potential differences in results
between brief, self-report questionnaire measures of
stressful life events and face-to-face interviews as well
as differences due to the type of study and the diagnos-
tic system used for assessment. Therefore, in addition
to subsets identified through tests for heterogeneity,
stratified meta-analyses based on the following factors
are planned:
1. Genetic Ancestry (e.g. European, Asian, Pacific
Island, Admixed European-African).
2. Study Type (e.g. cross-sectional versus longitudinal
data collection).
3. Assessment type (e.g. interview versus questionnaire,
diagnostic system).
4. Stress and depression phenotypes are based on
current state or lifetime reports.
One source of heterogeneity within an individual study
is the source of stress. A subset of our participating
groups minimized this particular source of heterogeneity
by ascertaining subjects that had all been exposed to a
uniform stressor (e.g. pregnancy, military conscription,
medical residency, coronary heart disease). Because the
primary hypothesis supposes that the effect of genotype
can be seen most strongly (or only) in subjects exposed
to stress, analyses including only these datasets may have
particular power to detect the hypothesized effect.
Statistical software
All analyses will be conducted using R due to its compu-
tational flexibility and free availability.
Group collaboration
The leadership team is responsible for the project's man-
agement decisions and the daily management of this collab-
oration. A series of conference calls with the contributing
investigative teams discussed and reviewed many issues
in the design of the meta-analysis. The leadership team,
in collaboration with individual study sites, developed
the initial protocol based on these discussions. The

coordinating team at Washington University developed
the analysis scripts and will perform the meta-analysis.
External beta testers for the scripts were essential for
the production and distribution of high-quality scripts
to the consortium members.
Ethics
All participating research groups have appropriate ethics
approval for the use of their data in the proposed sec-
ondary analyses. A listing of the participating studies,
the names of the study representatives collaborating on
this project, and the organizations providing ethical re-
view for the studies can be found in Additional file 3:

Washington University in St. Louis has stated that this
collaborative meta-analysis paradigm does not require
ethical approval beyond what has been provided to the
individual participating groups.
Discussion
Limitations
In this study, our emphasis is on harmonizing the ana-
lysis to maximize the number of studies to be included.
The hope is that a large sample size will overcome limi-
tations due to heterogeneity in measurements of depres-
sion and environment. This assumption is supported
by many GWAS meta-analyses and studies which find
many more genetic associations even when compromis-
ing on phenotyping, e.g. by considering anyone with a
clozapine prescription a case, rather than a formal
schizophrenia diagnosis (e.g. [44,45]). However, there are
limitations to this approach. Although the analysis will
be uniform, neither the phenotype nor the environment
was measured in a consistent fashion in all studies.
Second, the diathesis-stress model would predict that
an alternative approach might be to study a population
that was uniformly exposed to a specific stressor. A mi-
nority of the studies in our consortium are of this type
(e.g. ASPIS (military conscription), Heart and Soul (cor-
onary heart disease), Intern Health Study (medical in-
ternship), POUCH (pregnancy)).
Third, limiting the sample size to 300 was done for
practical reasons. On the other hand, the small pub-
lished studies were in their majority those with positive
findings [21]). Small samples may be more likely subject
to publication bias [23], but also tend to be assessed
more carefully, and hence this criterion may exclude
some of the best characterized samples.
Fourth, although we will perform a number of specific
heterogeneity tests, it is impossible to test all combinations.
Hence, although we will include many possible con-
founds and expect to have power to detect a robust
effect of genotype, a negative finding does not exclude
the possibility that a genetic effect exists that is very
sensitive to timing or to the method of measuring de-
pression or stress.
Summary
There is an ongoing debate about what role, if any, 5-
HTTLPR variation plays in depression. Various studies
have argued for (e.g., [15]) or against (e.g., [46]) the prop-
osition that an interaction between 5-HTTLPR variation
and stressful life events alters the subsequent risk of de-
pression. Both individual studies and meta-analyses of
published results have come to differing conclusions.
Numerous issues may contribute to the conflicting results
including: heterogeneity among studies (varying study
populations, varying definitions of depression, varying
measures of stress, prospective versus retrospective assess-
ments, varying analytical models); issues regarding timing
of stress and depression; underpowered samples; and pub-
lication bias. To address the numerous complexities of the
topic of the potential impact of 5-HTTLPR variation on
depression, hypothesized as a moderator of the response
to stress, we have designed a coordinated meta-analysis
that performs consistent, de novo analyses of all available
primary data, utilizing variables that are harmonized
across the datasets and with analyses that were deter-
mined a priori. These analyses will be implemented in a
set of primary analyses, arising from the original report of
a GxE interaction involving 5-HTTLPR variation, and sup-
plemented by secondary analyses intended to aid in the in-
terpretation of the main findings and to address numerous
issues related to possible heterogeneity between the con-
tributing studies. The risk of data mining and of type 1 er-
rors in large, multidimensional datasets such as ours is
great, and there is a clear need for consensus on best prac-
tice before analyses are conducted. It is our hope that by
publishing this protocol in advance of all analyses being
conducted, we will minimize potential biases.
Nomenclature
 5-HTT: Serotonin transporter gene.
 Official name: SLC6A4, location: 17q11.2. Also
known as HTT; 5HTT; OCD1; SERT; 5-HTT;
SERT1; hSERT.
 Summary: This gene encodes an integral membrane
protein that transports the neurotransmitter
serotonin from synaptic spaces into presynaptic
neurons. The encoded protein terminates the action
of serotonin and recycles it in a sodium-dependent
manner. This protein is a target of psychomotor
stimulants, such as amphetamines and cocaine, and
is a member of the sodium:neurotransmitter sym-
porter family.
 5-HTTLPR: serotonin-transporter-linked poly-
morphic region. Summary: A repeat length

that has been shown to affect the rate of serotonin
uptake. The short ("s") allele is associated with lower
transcriptional efficiency of the promoter compared
to the long ("l") allele.
