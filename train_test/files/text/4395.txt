Abstract
Coronary heart disease is the main cause of mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a
disease known to be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. The role of inflammation and
immunity in atherosclerotic process offers possible explanations for the increased cardiovascular
risk in patients with RA. The immune response to citrullinated peptides has been extensively
studied in RA; antibodies directed to citrullinated peptides are now a cornerstone for RA
diagnosis. However, few studies have investigated the response to citrullinated peptides and the
development of atherosclerotic plaque. Antibodies to carbamylated proteins can be detected
before the clinical onset of RA, suggesting a potential predictive role for these antibodies; on the
other hand, carbamylation of lipoproteins has been described in patients with cardiovascular
disease. This review examines the role of citrullination and carbamylation, two post-translational
protein modifications that appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of both RA and
atherosclerosis, expanding the similarities between these two diseases. Further investigation on
the role of the immune response to modified proteins may contribute to a better comprehension
of cardiovascular disease in patients with RA.

patients with RA.1 The role of inflammation
and immunity in the atherosclerotic process
offers possible explanations for the increased
cardiovascular risk observed in RA patients.
Post-translational modifications encom-
pass a group of reactions that modify the
structure and extend the functions of pro-
teins. Two of these modifications, citrullina-
tion and carbamylation, seem to be involved
in the pathogenesis of both RA and athero-
sclerosis, extending the links between the
two diseases.
Citrullination and RA
Citrullination is an enzymatic post-transla-
tional modification that is mediated by
peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD), which
transform peptide-bound arginine residues
into citrulline, a non-natural amino acid.2
Over the past decade, the immune response
to citrullinated peptides has been extensively
studied in RA, and anticitrullinated protein
antibodies (ACPA) are now a cornerstone
for the diagnosis of RA, with a specificity of
85­95% and a sensitivity of 68­79%.3 These
antibodies have a predictive role (as they can
be detected before RA onset), and a prog-
nostic role, being associated with a particu-
larly severe and erosive arthritis.3
Anticitrullinated protein antibodies are
implicated in the pathogenesis of RA.
Citrullinated peptides bind human leuko-
cyte antigen DRB1, the so-called shared
epitope, and a strong correlation between
ACPA positivity and shared epitope expres-
sion was demonstrated.4 Moreover, smok-
ing may induce an immune response to
citrullinated peptides, with generation of
ACPA and the onset of RA in shared-
epitope carriers.5 Published data support
a link between RA and chronic periodon-
titis; the oral pathogen Porphyromonas
gingivalis has the unique ability to produce
a PAD enzyme that citrullinates proteins
and may induce the development of RA in
genetically predisposed individuals.6
Interestingly, both cigarette smoking and
P. gingivalis are also risk factors for cardio-
vascular disease (Figure 1). The effect of
therapy on ACPA status remains
controversial.4

Citrullination and atherosclerosis
Few studies have investigated the response to
citrullinated peptides and the development
of atherosclerotic plaque. Sokolove et al.7
demonstrated that both citrullinated fibrino-
gen and vimentin were correlated with the
coronary artery calcium score in 134 female
patients with RA. Moreover, citrullinated
proteins and PAD-4 enzyme were detected
within atherosclerotic plaques obtained
from non-RA patients, and ACPA isolated
from patients with RA were able to target
these proteins.7 Citrullinated proteins and
PAD enzymes have also been detected in the
perivascular myocardial interstitium, espe-
cially in RA patients.8 Cambridge et al.9
investigated the possible association between
ACPA and CHD in 432 healthy subjects who
were followed up for 5 years. In this study,9 a
significantly higher percentage of partici-
pants who developed CHD were ACPA-
positive compared with those who did not
develop CHD; the association remained
significant even after adjustment for trad-
itional atherosclerotic risk factors.9
Carbamylation and RA
Carbamylation is a chemical post-
translational modification consisting of the
addition of a cyanate group on self peptides,
leading to the production of homocitrulline.
Among other factors, tobacco smoke seems
to induce protein carbamylation.10 The
immunogenicity of homocitrulline has been
studied in RA patients. Shi et al.11 detected
antibodies to carbamylated proteins in both
ACPA-positive and -negative patients; in
the latter group, carbamylated protein anti-
body positivity was strongly associated with
more erosive forms of RA compared with
antibody negativity.11 Moreover, cross-reac-
tivity between antibodies to citrullinated
and homocitrullinated proteins seems to be
low.11 Similar to ACPA and rheumatoid
factor, antibodies to carbamylated proteins
can be detected before the clinical onset of
RA, suggesting a potential predictive role
for these antibodies.12 The exact pathogenic
role of carbamylated proteins and the effect
of RA treatment on antibodies to these
proteins remain unaddressed.
Carbamylation and
atherosclerosis
Carbamylation of various lipoproteins has
been described in patients with cardiovascu-
lar disease. Carbamylated high-density lipo-
protein may promote atherogenesis by
impairing the balance between macro-
phage-mediated cholesterol uptake and
efflux.13 Carbamylation of low-density lipo-
protein (LDL) might induce endothelial
dysfunction, acting via the lectin-type oxi-
dized LDL receptor 1,14 a scavenger recep-
tor for oxidized LDL that has been
proposed as a biomarker of RA.15
Carbamylated LDL may uncouple endothe-
lial nitric oxide synthase, reducing nitric
oxide bioavailability and impairing endo-
thelium vasodilatation.14 Moreover, carba-
mylated LDL seems to promote monocyte
adhesion to endothelial cells, damage endo-
thelial cells and progenitor endothelial cells,
and induce vascular smooth muscle-cell
proliferation.16 Carbamylation of other pro-
teins that are not yet clearly elucidated, may
also contribute to the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis.
Conclusions
Citrullination and carbamylation are two
post-translational modifications that seem
to link RA and atherosclerosis, expanding
the similarities between these two inflamma-
tory, immune-mediated chronic diseases.
Further investigation into the role of
the immune response against citrulline
and homocitrulline may contribute to a
better cardiovascular outcome in patients
with RA.
