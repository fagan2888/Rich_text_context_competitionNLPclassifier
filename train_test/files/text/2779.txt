IMPORTANCE Psychiatric disorders and comorbidity are prevalent among incarcerated
juveniles. To date, no large-scale study has examined the comorbidity and continuity of
psychiatric disorders after youth leave detention.
OBJECTIVE To determine the comorbidity and continuity of psychiatric disorders among
youth 5 years after detention.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective longitudinal study of a stratified random
sample of 1829 youth (1172 male and 657 female; 1005 African American, 296 non-Hispanic
white, 524 Hispanic, and 4 other race/ethnicity) recruited from the Cook County Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center, Chicago, Illinois, between November 20, 1995, and June 14,
1998, and who received their time 2 follow-up interview between May 22, 2000, and April 3,
2004.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES At baseline, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children
Version 2.3. At follow-ups, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (child
and young adult versions) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version IV (substance use
disorders and antisocial personality disorder).
RESULTS Five years after detention, when participants were 14 to 24 years old, almost 27% of
males and 14% of females had comorbid psychiatric disorders. Although females had
significantly higher rates of comorbidity when in detention (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7),
males had significantly higher rates than females at follow-up (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI,
1.6-3.3). Substance use plus behavioral disorders was the most common comorbid profile
among males, affecting 1 in 6. Participants with more disorders at baseline were more likely to
have a disorder approximately 5 years after detention, even after adjusting for demographic
characteristics. We found substantial continuity of disorder. However, some baseline
disorders predicted alcohol and drug use disorders at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although prevalence rates of comorbidity decreased in youth
after detention, rates remained substantial and were higher than rates in the most
comparable studies of the general population. Youth with multiple disorders at baseline are at
highest risk for disorder 5 years later. Because many psychiatric disorders first appear in
childhood and adolescence, primary and secondary prevention of psychiatric disorders offers
the greatest opportunity to reduce costs to individuals, families, and society. Only a
concerted effort to address the many needs of delinquent youth will help them thrive in
adulthood.

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among juvenile
detainees has been well established.1,2 Almost two-
thirds of males and three-quarters of females entering
juvenile detention have 1 or more psychiatric disorders.2 Co-
morbid disorders are also common in this population, affect-
ing approximately half of the youth in detention.3,4
Far less is known about youth after they leave detention.
Teplin et al5 found that after detention prevalence rates of psy-
chiatric disorders decreased but were still substantially higher
than general population rates. Five years after detention, half
of the males and 40% of females had 1 or more psychiatric dis-
orders. However, longitudinal studies to date have examined
only the prevalence and persistence of specific disorders such
as major depression or alcohol use disorders. To our knowl-
edge, no study has examined the comorbidity and continuity
of psychiatric disorders after youth leave detention.
Many excellent general population studies have exam-
ined the comorbidity and continuity of disorders. However,
findings are not generalizable to detained youth for 2 rea-
sons. First, the demographic characteristics of youth in de-
tention are different from those of the general population.6
Youth in detention are disproportionately poor, and racial/
ethnic minorities are overrepresented.6,7 More than any other
racial/ethnic group, African Americans are disproportion-
ately incarcerated,6 comprising about 14% of the general
population8 but about 40% of youth and young adults in cor-
rectional facilities.9,10 Second, delinquent youth are system-
aticallyunderrepresentedingeneralpopulationinvestigations.5
School-based samples exclude youth who are truant, have
dropped out, or are incarcerated. Household surveys exclude
incarcerated youth. Samples drawn from pediatric clinics ex-
clude those who do not receive medical treatment. Even if
sampled initially, delinquent youth may be lost to follow-up
when they are incarcerated because they cannot be found and
becausestudyingprisonersrequiresspecialproceduresandap-
provals from the Secretary of Health and Human Services.11
Data on the comorbidity and continuity of disorders in de-
linquent youth are needed for 3 reasons. First, comorbid dis-
orders present significant challenges.12,13 Persons with comor-
bid disorders are less responsive to traditional treatments than
those with only one disorder12 and are more difficult to place
intreatmentbecausetheirneedscrosstraditionalboundaries.13
Second, identifying diagnostic predictors of later disorder has
ramifications for secondary prevention, treatment, and policy
inthecommunity.14,15 Juveniledetaineeshaveamedianlength
of stay of only 2 weeks.16 After release, juvenile detainees be-
come the responsibility of the community. Third, longitudi-
nal studies of correctional populations provide needed data
to address health disparities, a priority of the Institute of
Medicine17 and of the Healthy People 2020 publication.18 Data
on females are especially needed because they are a growing
minority in the juvenile justice system, now comprising 30%
of juvenile arrests.19

Procedures to Obtain Assent and Consent at Baseline
and Follow-up
The Northwestern University Institutional Review Board and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Institutional
Review Board approved all study procedures and waived pa-
rental consent for persons younger than 18 years, consistent
withfederalregulationsregardingresearchwithminimalrisk.21
For all interviews, participants signed either an assent form (if
<18 years old) or a consent form (if 18 years old).
Sample and Procedures
We recruited a stratified random sample of 1829 youth at in-
take to the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Cen-
ter in Chicago, Illinois, between November 20, 1995, and June
14, 1998, who were awaiting the adjudication or disposition of
their case. The Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center is used for pretrial detention and for offenders sen-
tenced for less than 30 days.
To ensure adequate representation of key subgroups, we
stratified our sample by sex, race/ethnicity (African Ameri-
can, non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, or other), age (10-13 or 14
years), and legal status at detention (processed in juvenile or
adult court). Face-to-face structured interviews were con-
ducted at the detention center in a private area, most within 2
days of intake.
Follow-up interviews were scheduled for 3 and 4Â½ years
after baseline. For each follow-up, we interviewed partici-
pants whether they lived in the community or in correctional
facilities. Table 1 lists characteristics of the sample.
Measures
Baseline
We administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Chil-
dren Version 2.3 (DISC-2.3),22,23 based on the DSM-III-R, the
mostrecentEnglishandSpanishversionsthenavailable,which
assesses disorders in the past 6 months. Because the DISC-2.3
did not include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we used
the module from the DISC-IV when it became available 13
months after the study began.20,24,25
Follow-up Interviews
We administered the DISC-IV (child and young adult ver-
sions), based on the DSM-IV, to assess schizophrenia, mood
disorders, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity

disorder (ADHD), and disruptive behavior disorders in the past
year.25 To assess past-year substance use disorders and anti-
social personality disorder (APD), we administered the Diag-
nostic Interview Schedule Version IV.26 As in our group's prior
work,5 we checked that changes in prevalence rates over time
were not due to changes in measurement.
Variables
Weconductedanalysesofspecificdisordersand2derivedvari-
ables. The first variable is the number of disorders, including
the count of disorders among mania, major depression, hypo-
mania, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic
disorder,PTSD,ADHD(if17yearsold),conductdisorder(if17
yearsold),oppositionaldefiantdisorder(ODD)(if17yearsold),
APD (if 18 years old), and alcohol and drug use disorders. The
second variable comprises categories of disorder, including in-
ternalizing (mania, major depression, hypomania, dysthy-
mia, GAD, panic disorder, and PTSD), substance (alcohol and
drugusedisorders),andbehavioral(conductdisorder,ODD,and
APD). Participants self-identified their race/ethnicity (African
American, Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, or other).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using commercial software
(STATA, version 12; StataCorp LP) with its survey routines.27
To generate prevalence rates and inferential statistics that re-
flect the population of the Cook County Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center, each participant was assigned a sampling
weight augmented with a nonresponse adjustment to ac-
count for missing data.28 Taylor series linearization was used
to estimate standard errors.29,30 Because mental health needs
of youth in detention differ by sex,2,3 we conducted separate
analyses for males and females.
We present prevalence rates of disorder at 3 time points:
baseline (time 0), time 1, and time 2. As in our group's prior
work,2 time 1 is the first follow-up interview but excludes in-
terviews that occurred more than 18 months after the inter-
view due date. The median time between baseline and time 1
was 3.0 years (mean [SD], 3.2 [0.3] years; range, 2.7-4.5 years).
Time 1 follow-up interviews were conducted between Novem-
ber 19, 1998, and August 8, 2002. For simplicity, we refer to the
time 1 interview as occurring approximately 3 years after base-
line. Table 1 summarizes the sample's demographics and re-
tention; 90.7% of participants had a time 1 interview.
Time 2 is the 4Â½-year follow-up interview. As with time 1,
we excluded interviews that occurred more than 18 months
after this due date. The median time between baseline and the
time 2 interview was 4.7 years (mean [SD], 4.8 [0.4] years;
range, 4.3-6.0 years). Time 2 follow-up interviews were con-
ducted between May 22, 2000, and April 3, 2004. For simplic-
ity, we subsequently refer to the time 2 interview as occur-
ring approximately 5 years after baseline; 82.2% of participants
had a time 2 interview (Table 1) (see the eMethods in the
Supplement for additional details on time 2).
We used logistic regression for 2 analyses. First, we exam-
ineddemographicdifferencesincomorbidity(2disorders[yes
or no]) at time 2. Second, we examined whether the number
of disorders at baseline was associated with having at least 1
disorder at time 2.
Models for Continuity of Disorders Over Time
We used a sequence of logistic regression models to examine
continuityofdisordersovertime.First,intheunadjustedmodel
the disorder at baseline was the single predictor of the disor-
der at follow-up. For example, is major depression at baseline
associatedwithalcoholusedisorderattime2?(Modelsinwhich
the baseline disorder predicts the same disorder at follow-up
arereferredtoashomotypicprediction.Modelsinwhichthebase-
line disorder predicts a different disorder at follow-up are re-
ferred to as heterotypic prediction.) Second, in the adjusted
model (heterotypic prediction only) we included whether the
disorder being predicted at follow-up was present at baseline
as well. For example, is major depression at baseline associ-
atedwithalcoholusedisorderattime2,evenafteradjustingfor
having alcohol use disorder at baseline? To determine whether
conduct disorder predicted APD, we used a modified diagno-
sisofAPDthatdidnotrequireadolescentconductdisorder.How-
ever, because findings were not substantially different from

models using the original APD diagnosis, we present data with
the original criteria. All models predicting substance use disor-
ders at follow-up were adjusted for time in corrections (linear
and quadratic terms for the number of days incarcerated in the
year before follow-up) because access to substances is typi-
cally restricted in correctional settings.
Results
Comorbidity of Psychiatric Disorders
Number of Disorders
Table 2 lists prevalence rates of the number of disorders. One-
third of males at time 1 and more than one-quarter of males at
time 2 had 2 or more disorders. Although females were more
likely to have 2 or more disorders at baseline (odds ratio [OR],
1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7), males were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0-2.0) times more
likely than females to have 2 or more disorders at time 1 and
2.3 (95% CI, 1.6-3.3) times more likely at time 2. African Ameri-
cans had the lowest rates of comorbidity. At time 2, among
males non-Hispanic whites were more likely than African
Americans(OR,2.2;95%CI,1.4-3.4)andHispanics(OR,1.9;95%
CI, 1.2-3.2) to have 2 or more disorders. At time 2, among fe-
males Hispanics were 1.8 (95% CI, 1.0-3.4) times more likely
to have 2 or more disorders than African Americans.
Categories of Disorder
Figure 1 shows the overlap of 3 categories of disorder (inter-
nalizing, substance, and behavioral) at baseline, time 1, and
time 2 for males and females. These figures show decreasing
overlap of categories of disorder over time, especially for
females. Among males, the most common comorbid profile
at time 2 was substance use plus behavioral disorders (16%).
Continuity of Disorders Over Time
Participants with more disorders at baseline were more
likely to have a disorder at time 2, even after adjusting for
demographic characteristics. For every additional disorder
at baseline, the odds of having a disorder at time 2 increased
by 1.2 (95% CI, 1.1-1.4) among males and 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.4)
among females. Among participants with all 3 types of dis-
order at baseline (internalizing, substance, and behavioral),
93.3% of males and 76.0% of females had at least 1 disorder
at time 2.
Figure 2 (males) and Figure 3 (females) list prevalence
rates of disorder at time 2 among those who did and did not
have a disorder present at baseline (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in
the Supplement list rates at time 1). Odds ratios contrast the
prevalence of disorder at time 2 between those who had the
disorder at baseline compared with those who did not have
the disorder at baseline. The first OR is unadjusted, and the
second OR is adjusted for the disorder at baseline (see the
Statistical Analysis and Models for Continuity of Disorders
Over Time subsections of the Methods section). Predictions
between disorders belonging to the same category (eg, PTSD
and GAD) are considered homotypic. We could not examine
continuity of disorder for mania or hypomania because
there were too few cases at baseline. We could not predict
mania, hypomania, dysthymia, panic disorder, or GAD at
time 1 or time 2 because prevalence rates were too low for
stable estimates.

a Descriptive statistics are weighted to adjust for sampling design and reflect
the demographic characteristics of the Cook County Juvenile Temporary

disorders: mania, major depression, hypomania, dysthymia, generalized
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (if 17 years old), conduct disorder (if
17 years old), oppositional defiant disorder (if 17 years old), antisocial
personality disorder (if 18 years old), and alcohol and drug use disorders.

Discussion
Although the prevalence of comorbidity decreased among
youth after detention, 5 years later (when the mean age of
our sample was 20 years) almost 27% of males and 14% of
females had comorbid psychiatric disorders. The drop in
prevalence is similar to that of specific disorders.5 The most
comparable investigations of comorbidity in the general
population included adults of all ages, who have fewer dis-
orders than young adults.31 Even with this caveat, the
prevalence of comorbidity among our sample appears sub-
stantially higher than that in the National Comorbidity Sur-
vey Replication (5.8% of adults 18-44 years old)32 and the
Epidemiologic Catchment Area Survey (4.8% of adults 18
years old).33

more disorders 5 years later. These patterns are of concern. The
longer a disorder persists (especially if there is more than 1 dis-
order), the greater is the impact on the individual in function-
ing, physical symptoms, and stress.37
Among males 5 years after detention, the most common

depression were 2 to 4 times more likely to have substance use
disorders at follow-up than those without those disorders at
baseline. How can we account for these findings? Some argue
that neurobehavioral disinhibition underlies both behavioral
andsubstanceusedisorders,suggestingasharedmechanism.40
Mood disorders may also lead to the abuse of substances (self-
medicationhypothesis).41 Finally,moodandsubstanceusedis-
orders may also stem from a common neurobiological path-
way, increasing vulnerability to both disorders.42
Among females, no diagnostic profile predominated at fol-
low-up.Wefoundsubstantialcontinuityforalcoholanddruguse
disorders, APD (from conduct disorder), and anxiety disorders
(GAD to PTSD). As with males, heterotypic prediction was less
common. However, females with ODD in detention were 2 to 4
timesmorelikelythanthosewithoutODDtohavesubstanceuse
disordersatfollow-up.Moreover,femalesindetentionwithGAD
were 3 times more likely than those without GAD to have major
depression at follow-up. In general population studies,14,43,44
anxiety and depression commonly cross-predict.
Although females were significantly more likely to have
comorbidity at baseline, 5 years after detention males were
more likely than females to have comorbid disorders. Be-
cause males comprise more than 85% of youth in the juvenile
justice system, mental health services for males are critical.10
The prevalence of comorbidity over time may differ by sex for
3 reasons. First, female arrestees may be treated more leni-
ently by the courts than males and are more likely to be di-
verted from detention (chivalry hypothesis).45 Therefore, fe-
males who are detained may be more dysfunctional and have
more problem behaviors and disorders than their male coun-
terparts. Second, after detention females are more likely to re-
ceive mental health services than males.46 Third, females are
less likely to persist in delinquency than males.47,48
Racial/ethnic differences were similar to those for spe-
cific disorders.5 African Americans had the lowest preva-
lence of comorbidity, and non-Hispanic whites had the
highest. As noted in prior studies,2,5 these differences may
reflect racial/ethnic disparities in criteria for detention.
Limitations
Our data are subject to the limitations of self-report. Moreover,
it was not feasible to study more than 1 jurisdiction; generaliz-
ability may be limited to detained youth in urban centers with
similar demographic compositions. Participants may have had
disorders that we did not examine; hence, overall prevalence
rates may be higher than reported. We changed measures dur-
ing the follow-up period because of updates to the DSM and its
associated measures and because of the aging of our partici-
pants. We could not adjust for all comorbid disorders in predic-
tive models owing to small cell sizes. Although retention rates
werehighandhypomaniawastheonlydisorderassociatedwith
dropout, participants who missed interviews might be more
likely to have had disorders than those who were interviewed.
Thesamplewasrecruitedinthelate1990s;however,criticalfea-
tures of the population (demographic characteristics, the in-
crease in delinquent females, and the disproportionate incar-
ceration of minorities) have not changed. Our findings do not
take into account any mental health services received.
Implications for Mental Health Policy and Research
Provide Coordinated Treatment for Youth Leaving Detention
Recent efforts to improve interventions for delinquent popu-
lations have highlighted several empirically supported mod-
els to address not only their complex mental health needs (in-
cluding comorbidity) but also their considerable psychosocial
impairments.49,50 These models have in common a system-
oriented, family-based approach that integrates treatment
across service sectors and settings.49,50 The Institute of Medi-
cine's quality chasm series concluded that treatment of youth
(and adults) with comorbid disorders continues to be compro-
mised by our fragmented systems of care.51 The Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act offers an opportunity to im-
prove treatment by expanding access to care, payment reform,
and information technology (to increase communication), as
well as integrating services such as medical homes that focus
on the whole person.52,53
Implement Early Interventions to Prevent Substance Use Disorders
By the time youth are detained (age range, 10-17 years), it is
too late for primary prevention. Substance use and internal-
izing and behavioral disorders at baseline predicted sub-
stanceusedisordersatfollow-up,consistentwithfindingsfrom
general population studies.54-56 Treating childhood disor-
ders (especially behavioral disorders) might reduce second-
ary substance use disorders.15,57 By improving screening and
referral practices in elementary school15,58 and at pediatric
clinics,59 at-risk youth can be treated in early childhood.
Conduct Prospective Studies of Continuity and Comorbid Disorders
From Childhood to Adulthood in Representative Samples
of the General Population
How one disorder affects or predicts the subsequent develop-
ment or course of another disorder appears to change as youth
age.60,61 Yet, knowledge is hampered by the limitations of gen-
eral population investigations.62 Most large-scale epidemio-
logicinvestigationsofpsychiatricdisordersintheUnitedStates
either did not draw samples during childhood or have not been
longitudinal.63-66 Landmark prospective studies14,15,44,60,67,68
ofchildrenhaveinsufficientdiversity,particularlygivenracial/
ethnic trends in the US census.69 For example, there are few
epidemiologic data on Hispanics, now the largest minority
group in the United States. The advent of DSM-5 and the op-
portunity to advance a new standard of assessment make this
a timely endeavor.
Conclusions
Many psychiatric disorders first appear in childhood and
adolescence.58,70 Early-onset psychiatric disorders are among
the illnesses ranked highest in the World Health Organiza-
tion's estimates of the global burden of disease,71 creating an-
nual costs of $247 billion in the United States.72 Successful pri-
mary and secondary prevention of psychiatric disorders will
reduce costs to individuals, families, and society.73 Only a con-
certed effort to address the many needs of delinquent youth
will help them thrive in adulthood.
