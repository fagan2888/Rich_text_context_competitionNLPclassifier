Obesity and C-reactive Protein Levels Among
White, Black, and Hispanic US Adults
Christina C. Wee1, Kenneth J. Mukamal1, Annong Huang1, Roger B. Davis1,

Objective: Studies suggest that obesity's adverse impact on cardiovascular mortality may be reduced in African
Americans relative to white Americans. We examined whether obesity's association with novel cardiovascular risk
factors such as C-reactive protein (CRP) also varies by race and ethnicity.
Methods and Procedures: We analyzed data from 10,492 white, African-American, and Hispanic-American
participants of the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, who were aged 20 years and
older, with a BMI 18.5kg/m2 and CRP 10mg/l. We fit sex-specific multivariable models of the association of
BMI or waist circumference with log CRP levels and tested for interactions of BMI or waist circumference with
race/ethnicity.
Results: Higher BMI was significantly associated with higher CRP in all racial/ethnic groups for both men and
women (P > 0.05 for BMI­race/ethnicity interaction) before and after adjustment for age, education, and health
behaviors. Larger waist circumference was also associated with higher CRP levels in all racial/ethnic groups
before and after adjustment; among women, the relationship was strongest for Mexican Hispanics (P < 0.01 for
waist circumference­race/ethnicity interaction). Results were similar after additional adjustment for medications
that might affect CRP levels.
Discussion: The association between obesity and CRP is at least as strong in African Americans and Hispanic
Americans as in white Americans. Racial differences in the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular
mortality are unlikely to be due to racial differences in obesity's impact on CRP.

Introduction
Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and a major
contributor to cardiovascular risk and mortality in the United
States. Despite obesity's disproportionately high prevalence
in African Americans and Hispanic American (1,2), stud-
ies suggest that its adverse impact on cardiovascular risk
and mortality may be reduced in some minority populations
(3­8). For example, even though African Americans have a
higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes than white
Americans, evidence suggests that the associations between
obesity and these cardiovascular risk factors are steeper in
white Americans than in African Americans (9­11). The
adverse relationship between obesity and dyslipidemia is
similarly attenuated in African Americans relative to white
Americans (11).
Increasingly, systemic and vascular inflammation are
implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular outcomes
(12,13). C-reactive protein, or CRP, is a sensitive marker of
inflammation and is perhaps the most well studied of these
novel markers of cardiovascular disease (14­16). Higher
levels of CRP are associated with higher risk of myocardial
infarction, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular 
mortality
(14­17). CRP levels are also elevated in the presence of met-
abolic risk factors such as obesity (18). Adipose tissue is a
major producer of proinflammatory cytokines and hormones
and is thought to induce low-grade systemic inflammation
(19). However, while several studies demonstrate that levels
of CRP are elevated in persons with higher BMI (18), and that
weight loss reduces CRP (20,21), few studies have examined
whether obesity might have a differential impact on CRP lev-
els in different racial and ethnic groups.
In this context, we examined the interplay of race, ethnicity,
and obesity on CRP levels in a nationally representative sample
of US adults to evaluate whether the relationship between obe-
sity and CRP is attenuated in Africans Americans and other
ethnic minorities relative to white Americans.

Methods And Procedures
Data source and measurements
We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey, or NHANES, a stratified multistage probability sample of the
noninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States conducted
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National
Center for Health Statistics (22). NHANES is designed to assess the
health and nutritional status of adults and children through inter-
views and physical examination; methodological aspects of the study
have been described in detail elsewhere (22­25). Beginning in 1999,
the study was redesigned to be an ongoing continuous program. Data
are released in 2-year cycles. NHANES oversamples certain popula-
tions, including African Americans, Mexican Americans, and pregnant
women; however, design weights and sampling information are pro-
vided so that analyses can account for the complex sampling design
and be generalized to the US population. Our study utilized the most
recently available completed data from 1999 to 2004. This study was
exempted from continuing review by the Institutional Review Board at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
Our study sample consisted of adults aged 20 years and older, who
completed home interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and phys-
ical and laboratory examinations at mobile examination units. Infor-
mation about participants' sociodemographic characteristics, health
habits, and medical history were collected via in-person interviews and
through self-administered questionnaires. We categorized participants'
self-identified race/ethnicity as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black
or African American, Mexican Hispanic, and non-Mexican Hispanic,
and other race/ethnicity. Because participants in the "other race" cat-
egory are a small but heterogeneous group (n = 466), we did not include
these participants in our study. We also classified participants accord-
ing to other relevant demographic and behavioral factors including
educational status (less than high school, completed high school, high
school and beyond), smoking history (never smoked or smoked <100
cigarettes in lifetime, former smoker, and current smoker), alcohol use,
and physical activity level. Quantity and frequency of alcohol use were
jointly characterized as follows: nondrinker; 1­2 drinking days/week
and less than two drinks per day; 1­2 drinking days/week and two or
more drinks per day; 3 or more drinking days/week and two or less
drinks per day; 3 or more drinking days/week and two or more drinks
per day. We calculated the energy expended in metabolic equivalents
(METs) based on participants' reports of physical activity using estimates
provided in NHANES (22,26) and classified physical activity level in
population-based quartiles.
Participants were also asked to report all over-the-counter and pre-
scription medications including medications that might affect CRP lev-
els such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, lipid-lowering
statin medications, and estrogen-containing medicines (27). At the time
of our study, medication use was available only for participants of the
1999­2002 NHANES.
A standardized set of physical and laboratory examinations were
conducted in mobile examination centers and included measured
height and weight. Our primary measure of adiposity, BMI, was
calculated from measured height and weight; we classified partici-
pants as normal weight (BMI = 18.5­24.9kg/m2), overweight (BMI =
25.0­29.9kg/m2), class I obesity (BMI = 30.0­34.9kg/m2), and class
II­III obesity (BMI = 35.0kg/m2 and higher), according to standard
definitions (28). Waist circumference, our second marker of adipos-
ity, was measured in centimeters and then converted to inches and
was classified in sex-specific quartiles. Blood samples were collected
on adults' aged 20 years and older and centrifuged within 1h of phle-
botomy and frozen at -10°C. CRP concentrations were measured by
latex-enhanced nephelometry (N high-sensitivity CRP assay) (22). We
treated high-sensitivity CRP as a continuous outcome and excluded
participants with CRP levels >10mg/l (n = 1528) (27), as such high
levels likely reflect acute illness. We also excluded a small number
of underweight participants with a BMI <18.5kg/m2 (n = 183) and
women who were pregnant (n = 486).
Statistical analysis
We characterized CRP levels in our overall sample, according to race,
ethnicity, BMI, and waist circumference. Because CRP levels were not
normally distributed, we used the logarithmic transformation of CRP
levels as our outcome measure in sex-specific multivariable analyses
and then "back transformed" our results and expressed our findings
in terms of the geometric mean of CRP. We examined the association
between BMI and log CRP, adjusting for race and ethnicity and then
tested for an interaction between race/ethnicity and BMI. Our primary
analyses were adjusted for age, education, and health behaviors (smok-
ing, alcohol, and physical activity). In sensitivity analyses in the subset
with complete data, we considered the confounding effect of income
and medication use (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins,
and estrogen use in women) separately on the relationship between
BMI and log CRP. To explore the robustness of our findings, we exam-
ined the association between waist circumference and log CRP using
the similar approach as for our BMI-log CRP analyses.
We weighted all analyses to reflect population estimates and used SAS-
callable SUDAAN statistical software (Research Triangle Park, NC) (29)
to produce appropriate standard errors that account for the complex clus-
tered sampling design.
Results
Table 1 describes our study population of 10,492 men and
women aged 20 years and older, who have a BMI of 18.5kg/m2
or higher and a CRP of 10mg/l or lower. Sex-stratified demo-
graphic and behavioral factors differed significantly across race
and ethnicity in our sample. Before adjustment, BMI and waist
circumference also varied significantly by race and ethnicity
in both men and women. In contrast, mean CRP levels were
significantly different by race and ethnicity in women but not
in men; among women, CRP levels were lowest in whites and
highest in Mexican Hispanics.
Table 2 presents age-adjusted CRP levels across BMI and
race/ethnicity, as well as across waist circumference and race/
ethnicity. Higher BMI and higher waist circumference were
associated with higher CRP levels for men and women in all
racial and ethnic groups studied (P < 0.001 for all).
Higher BMI was associated with CRP levels after adjustment
for age, race and ethnicity, education, and health behaviors, P <
0.001 for both men and women (data not shown). Figure 1 pres-
ents mean CRP levels in men and women by race and ethnicity
after adjustment. The relationship between BMI and mean CRP
did not vary significantly across race and ethnicity in men (P =
0.10 for race­BMI interaction) or in women (P = 0.37 for race­
BMI interaction). However, while not statistically significant, the
slope for the relationships between BMI and CRP appear steeper
for non-MexicanHispanicAmericansthanfor other groups;this
apparent steeper relationship was driven primarily by the dis-
proportionately high CRP levels in non-Mexican Hispanics with
a BMI 35kg/m2 which comprised <30 participants. Additional
adjustment for income and relevant medications in sensitivity
analyses did not change our results substantially.
Higher waist circumference was also significantly associated
with CRP levels in both men and women (P < 0.001 for both)
after adjustment for age, race and ethnicity, education, and
health behaviors. This association varied significantly by race
and ethnicity (P = 0.01) in women but not in men (P = 0.77).
Among women, the association between waist circumference

and CRP was most striking for Mexican-Hispanic Americans.
These results were consistent in sensitivity analyses adjusting
for income and relevant medications.
Table 3 presents the age-adjusted mean waist circumference
for men and women across BMI and race and ethnicity in the
overall study population. In analyses stratified by BMI category,
racial and ethnic differences in mean waist circumference were
highly significant (P < 0.001 at all BMI levels) in men. Among
women, racial and ethnic differences reached statistical signifi-
cance only for women in the middle two BMI levels (P = 0.02
for BMI = 25.0­34.9kg/m2). To examine whether racial and
ethnic differences in the adjusted relationship between waist
circumference and CRP (Figure 2) might be due to racial and
ethnic differences in the association between BMI and waist

circumference, we conducted post-hoc multivariable analy-
ses of waist circumference and CRP, additionally adjusting for
BMI (both in categories and linearly). The relationship between
waist circumference and CRP were attenuated but remained
statistically significant; moreover, the interaction between
waist circumference and race-ethnicity remained statistically
significant in women (Figure 3).
Discussion
Our findings suggest that the relationship between obesity and
higher CRP levels appears to be as strong in African Americans
and Hispanic Americans as in white American adults. The
association between BMI and CRP did not vary significantly
across race and ethnicity, and the association between larger
waist circumference and higher CRP levels was also at least as
strong in African Americans and possibly stronger in Mexican-
Hispanic­American women relative to white women.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among
Americans and the leading cause of death attributable to obe-
sity (8). Moreover, among certain racial and ethnic minority
populations such as African Americans, the rate of death from
cardiovascular disease is substantially higher than the rate in
whites (4,5). Paradoxically, while the prevalence of obesity and
the rate of cardiovascular death is higher in African Americans,
a number of studies have suggested that obesity has less of an
adverse impact on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in
African Americans than in white populations in the United
States (3­8). The racial differences are most striking in women,
where the relative risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality
associated with the highest categories of BMI can be several-
fold higher in white women compared to African American
women (8). Much less is known about the impact of obesity on
mortality differing between Hispanic and white populations.
While the factors contributing to racial differences in the
impact of BMI and mortality are unclear, growing evidence
suggests that obesity may have a reduced impact on some tra-
ditional cardiovascular risk factors (9­11). Using data from the

National Health and Nutrition Examination Epidemiologic
Follow-up Study, Resnick and colleagues found that relative to
whites, the risk for developing diabetes in African American
men and women was disproportionately higher in the lean
BMI ranges than in the overweight and obese ranges (9).
These findings are consistent with those of more recent
studies (30). A few studies have also suggested that while
African Americans are more likely to develop hypertension
than white Americans, the association between higher BMI
and the prevalence of hypertension is attenuated in African
Americans (11,31). Similarly, the relationship between obe-
sity and adverse lipid profile may also be reduced in African
Americans relative to whites (11).
However, traditional cardiovascular risk factors do not fully
characterize an individual's cardiovascular risk. Increasingly,
studies in primarily white-American populations suggest
that inflammatory markers such as CRP levels have shown
to independently predict cardiovascular disease and adverse
cardiovascular outcomes (14­17). Although the magnitude
of the predictive contribution of inflammation beyond that of
traditional cardiovascular risk factors is being debated (32,33),
one of the mechanisms by which obesity and adiposity confer
cardiovascular risk is likely through heightened inflammation.
Our findings suggest that the relationship between BMI and
CRP levels is comparable among white, African-American,
and Hispanic populations in the United States and that vis-
ceral adiposity, measured by waist circumference, may be more
adversely associated with inflammation in Mexican-Hispanic
women than in white women. Given our findings, observed
racial differences in the relationship between obesity and car-
diovascular mortality risk are unlikely to be mediated by an
attenuated relationship between obesity and CRP level in cer-
tain racial and ethnic minorities.
Previous studies have suggested that CRP levels do vary by
sexandrace(34­37),althoughfewhaveexaminedthisvariation
in the context of obesity. These prior data suggest that women
generally have higher CRP levels than men and that African
Americans, particularly African-American women and south
Asians generally have higher levels than white adults (34). In
the Women's Health Study, African-American women had the
highest CRP levels, Asian women had the lowest, and white
and Hispanic women had levels in the intermediate range (37).
Our data also suggest that women generally have higher CRP
levels than men but that much of the racial difference in CRP
levels in women, in particular, is substantially diminished after
accounting for age and obesity. We found no racial differences
in the relationship between obesity and CRP level in both men
and women, with one exception. Among women, Mexican
Hispanics with the largest waist circumference had an exag-
gerated CRP level compared to women of other racial/ethnic
groups. The significance of this finding is unclear and needs to
be replicated in future studies.
Our study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional
and observational design prevents us from drawing causal
inferences about the relationship between obesity and CRP
levels. Second, BMI and waist circumference are surrogate
markers for adiposity, and CRP is only one measure of inflam-
mation.Finally,wewereunabletoadjustforresidualconfound-
ing from noncardiovascular, inflammatory conditions that are

outcomes, although we attempted to minimize this confound-
ing by excluding underweight and pregnant individuals and
those with CRP levels above 10mg/l from our study.
In summary, obesity appears to be as strongly associated with
systemic inflammation as measured by CRP levels in African
Americans and Hispanic Americans as in white Americans.
Racial differences in the relationship between obesity and
cardiovascular mortality are unlikely to be mediated by racial
differences in obesity's association with CRP levels. Adiposity
may confer a more detrimental impact on inflammation in
Mexican-Hispanic Americans, and therefore future research
should clarify CRP's role in predicting cardiovascular risk in
this and other racial and ethnic minority groups.
