Introduction
Suicide is a serious public and mental health challenge.
Ranked as the second leading cause of death in 15- to
29-year-olds, globally, suicide claims over 800,000 lives
each year, with a suicide-related death occurring every 40 s
somewhere around the world, and many more people
attempting suicide (World Health Organization [WHO],
2014). As reported generally across the African continent
and most low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs),
there are no official statistics on the epidemiology and bur-
den of suicide in Ghana (Hjelmeland et al., 2008; Knizek,
Akotia, & Hjelmeland, 2011; Quarshie, Osafo, Akotia, &
Peprah, 2015; WHO, 2014). However, recent anecdotal sta-
tistical evidence shows that about 1,556 people (i.e., roughly
five people in a day) die by suicide yearly in Ghana (Citifm
Online, 2012). Although these statistics and estimates may
appear staggering (and arguably crude), they are undoubt-
edly a fair reflection of the reality and burden of the phenom-
enon of suicide in Ghana (Knizek, Akotia, & Hjelmeland,
2011; Quarshie et al., 2015).
WHO (2014) encourages member countries across the
world to place high premium on suicide prevention irrespec-
tive of a country's current position in terms of suicide rate or
suicide prevention activities; and in Africa, there is an urgent
need to prioritize suicide prevention (Burrows & Schlebusch,
2009). Thus, the clarion call to suicide prevention is now a
global imperative targeted at reducing the rate of suicide in
countries by 10% by the year 2020 (WHO, 2013, 2014). The
recommendations to achieve this target according to the
WHO (2013, 2014) include (but not exclusively limited to)
programs such as timely and effective evidence-based inter-
ventions, treatment and support, and decriminalization of
suicide attempts.Asuicide attempt here refers to engagement
in a potentially self-destructive behavior which does not
result in death but in which there is at least some intent to die
(Mars, Burrows, Hjelmeland, & Gunnell, 2014; Nock &
Favazza, 2009).
Suicide attempts are 20 times more frequent than "com-
pleted" suicides (WHO, 2012, 2014) and leave burdens for

Implications

Abstract
The penal code of Ghana condemns suicide attempt. The present study sought to explore the views of the police on persons
who attempt suicide and the law criminalizing the act. Qualitative in-depth interviews were used to explore the views of 18
officers of the Ghana Police Service. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis technique. Findings showed that the police
officers profiled suicide attempters as needy, enigmatic, ignorant, and blameworthy. Majority (n = 14) of them disagreed with the
law and suggested a repeal, whereas only four of them agreed with the law. Regardless of their positions on criminalization,
they showed an inclination to help, rather than arrest, when confronted with such persons in line of their duty. Educating the
police on suicidal behavior may help to deepen their understanding and help improve the way they handle suicidal persons.
This may also strengthen police suicide prevention gatekeeping obligations.

families and communities such as stigma, complicated grief,
and other negative psychosocial outcomes (Ougrin, Zundel,
& Ng, 2010). More significantly, prior suicide attempt is
known to be the single strongest predictor and risk of death
by suicide in the general population (Hawton, Rodham, &
Evans, 2006; Ougrin, Zundel, & Ng, 2010; WHO, 2014).
The implication is that persons who have attempted suicide
in the past are at higher risk of death by suicide in the future
than individuals without any prior suicide attempts.
Therefore, identifying these at-risk individuals and groups to
provide them with follow-up care and support has been
underscored as a key element of any comprehensive strategy
aimed at suicide prevention (WHO, 2012, 2013, 2014).
WHO (2014) admonishes thus, "all countries should review
their legal provisions in relation to suicide to ensure they do
not deter people from seeking help" (p. 51).
However, Ghana is still one of the WHO member coun-
tries with laws against suicide attempt (Adinkrah, 2016;
Mishara & Weisstub, 2015; WHO, 2014). The Criminal
Code of Ghana (Act 29 of Ghana, Section 57; Subsection II,
1960) provides that "whoever attempts to commit suicide
shall be guilty of a misdemeanour." Hence, a person who
attempts suicide is subject to arrest and prosecution, and is
made to face criminal sanctions upon conviction (Adinkrah,
2012b, 2016; Hjelmeland, Osafo, Akotia, & Knizek, 2014;
Kahn & Lester, 2013). This penal code was promulgated
based on the British Common Law (Adinkrah, 2016;
Adomakoh, 1975; Seidman & Eyison, 1969), which has long
been repealed--since 1961--in England and Wales, so that
suicide attempt is no longer seen as a criminal offense in
these countries, but rather treated as a health problem requir-
ing professional psychological and/or psychiatric attention
(Neeleman, 1996).
Seeking to understand the legal position of any country in
relation to suicide (specifically, decriminalizing attempted sui-
cide) requires customized, contextually relevant and culturally
sensitive research (Adinkrah, 2016; Aggarwal, 2015; Kahn &
Lester, 2013; Neeleman, 1996; Ranjan, Kumar, Pattanayak,
Dhawan, & Sagar, 2014). In Ghana, the burgeoning research
efforts aimed at understanding the attitudes of people toward
the act that criminalizes attempted suicide have thus far
focused on the views and attitudes of various stakeholders
(e.g., media, university students, nurses, psychologists, non-
governmental organizations, and researchers) (see Adinkrah,
2012; Adomakoh, 1975; Der, Dakwah, Derkyi-Kwarteng, &
Badu, 2016; Hjelmeland, Osafo, Akotia, & Knizek, 2014;
Kahn & Lester, 2013; Knizek, Akotia, & Hjelmeland, 2011;
Osafo, Knizek, Akotia, & Hjelmeland, 2012). Various argu-
ments for and against the (potential merits and demerits of)
decriminalization of attempted suicide in Ghana have been
comprehensively discussed elsewhere (e.g., see Adinkrah,
2012b, 2016; Adomakoh, 1975; Doku, Wusu-Takyi, &
Awakame, 2012; Hjelmeland et al., 2014; Kahn & Lester,
2013). This study is aimed at extending these studies to include
the police in Ghana.
The police have a long-standing history regarding social
and community intervention with individuals experiencing
mental health problems, even though the extent of their
involvement and the posture of their interactions have
changed across time (Matheson et al., 2005; Spence &
Millott, 2016). The involvement of the police with citizens
experiencing mental health problems (including people in
suicidal crisis) is explained based on two legal principles
(Engel & Silver, 2001; Psarra et al., 2008; Teplin & Pruett,
1992). The first is the police power function principle, that is,
the duty of the police to protect the safety and welfare of the
citizenry by removing dangerous people from the commu-
nity. This responsibility demands that the police apprehend
suspects who break the law irrespective of the suspects'men-
tal health condition (Engel & Silver, 2001; Teplin & Pruett,
1992). The second principle is parens patriae. This principle
provides that it is the duty of the police to assist citizens who
are in need or unable to help themselves. The principle of
parens patriae most often informs police decision, discre-
tion, and arrest behavior in cases where a mentally disturbed
suspect is involved in a misdemeanor, or criminal situations
involving mentally disordered persons, usually posing a
threat to themselves or to community members (Engel &
Silver, 2001; Psarra et al., 2008; Wachholz & Mullaly, 1993).
Ghana has a projected population of 27,670,174 (Ghana
Statistical Service, 2016) with a police­population ratio of
1:784, as against the United Nations's (UN) policing bench-
mark of one police person to 500 people (Ankrah, 2015). The
Police Service Act of Ghana (1970) states that "it shall be the
duties of the Police Force to prevent and detect crime, to
apprehend offenders and to maintain public order and safety
of persons and properties" (Act 350 of Ghana, Section 1).
Thus, with suicides and suicide attempts criminalized in
Ghana, police officers frequently come into contact with sui-
cidal persons and sometimes their significant others, mainly,
because they (the police) are often the first emergency service
to be called upon when a person is suspected to be at risk of
(or even dead by) suicide, and they regularly help to handle
suicide and other mental health­related crises within the com-
munity (Lester & Pitts, 1991; Marzano, Smith, Long, Kisby,
& Hawton, 2016; Matheson et al., 2005; Quarshie et al., 2015;
Spence & Millott, 2016). This implies that the police (apart
from maintaining and enforcing law and order) double as
frontline mental health workers within the community setting
(Fry, O'Riordan, & Geanellos, 2002; Green, 1997;
Omoaregba, James, Igbinowanhia, & Akhiwu, 2015; Teplin
& Pruett, 1992). Furthermore, in the current Mental Health
Act of Ghana (Act 846 of Ghana, 2012), the police engage-
ment in mental health is indicated at the level of diversion.
They are the first point of potential diversion of the mentally
ill to relevant centers for attention and help. Therefore, in the
bid to expand the burgeoning evidence (e.g., Adinkrah,
2012b, 2016; Hjelmeland et al., 2014; Kahn & Lester, 2013;
Osafo, Akotia, Andoh-Arthur, Boakye, & Quarshie, 2017;
Osafo, Akotia, & Boakye, 2016) and training programs (e.g.,
Osafo et al. 3
for media personnel, judges and lawyers, health profession-
als, police officers, etc.) to push for the decriminalization of
attempted suicide in Ghana, the present study finds it impera-
tive to explore the views of personnel of the Ghana Police
Service on suicidal persons and the law criminalizing suicide
attempts in the country. Such a study can further our under-
standing of the gatekeeping role of the police in suicide pre-
vention,aswellascontributingtothedebateondecriminalizing
attempted suicide in Ghana.
Method
The Ghana Police Service is segmented into 12 administrative
regions: Accra, Tema, Ashanti, Eastern, Brong Ahafo, Volta,
Western, Central, Northern, Upper East, Upper West, and rail-
ways, ports, and harbor regions. The Marine Police Unit
(MPU) has recently been created to handle security and polic-
ing matters that emanate from the country's steadily develop-
ing offshore oil and gas industry (Brookman-Amissah,
Wemegah, & Okyere, 2014). Accra, the capital of Ghana, was
the site for this study. The purposive and convenient sampling
techniques were used to select 18 personnel of the Ghana
Police Service (see characteristics in Table 1). Police officers
who were informed about the study by their superiors in their
respective stations and registered their interest were
approached. The informants were aged between 25 and 50
years, with an average age of 40.2 years; they were ranked
from corporal through chief inspector, with an average polic-
ing experience of 15.3 years. The informants were taken
through one-to-one semistructured qualitative interviews.
Among other relevant questions, informants were asked,
"What is your view on the law criminalizing suicide attempts
in Ghana?"; "What is your opinion on why people attempt sui-
cide in Ghana?" Each informant was approached in his or her
office and interviewed in English because all of them preferred
to have the conversation in that medium. Averagely, each
interview lasted 45 min. All the interviews were audiotaped
for transcription and analysis.
Thematic analysis, "a method for identifying, analysing
and reporting patterns (themes) within data" (Braun &
Clarke, 2006, p. 79), was used to analyze the transcribed
data. From listening to the audiotaped interviews vis-à-vis
the transcripts to correct any errors of omission, typos, and
misprints in the transcripts, we began the analysis of the data
by noting and agreeing on initial codes that were closely
related and relevant to the research question. Each of the
researchers iteratively read the transcripts independently to
map out themes related to the initial codes noted. To ensure a
strong connection between the mapped out working themes
and the data, we analyzed and teased out the themes which
were closely and sufficiently supported by the evidence con-
tained in the interviews (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Buetow,
2010; Clarke & Braun, 2013). The interpretation of the noted
working themes was conducted by iteratively reading the
transcripts as well as making reference to relevant literature
and research team consensus. Compelling excerpts of the
police views contained in the transcripts were culled to sup-
port the representation and discussion of the working themes.
The protocol and ethical position of the study were
approved and cleared by the Ethics Committee for the
Humanities (ECH) of the University of Ghana, Legon, and
permission to access participants was granted by the Greater
Accra Regional Headquarters of the Ghana Police Service.
Each of the informants signed an actual consent form prior to
participation.
Findings
The data analysis showed three superordinate themes: profil-
ing suicidal persons, police position on the law, and gate-
keeping posture.
Profiling Suicidal Persons
Prior to examining the position of the police on the law crim-
inalizing attempted suicide, it was imperative to explore how
the police viewed or profiled suicidal persons as offenders of
the law against attempted suicide in Ghana. Offender profil-
ing involves offering an account of the characteristics of an
offender based on the nature of the crime committed (Canter,
2004). The theme, profiling suicidal persons, thus examines
the views of the police regarding suicidal persons based on
their (police) experiences of handling suicide-related cases
in their line of duty. In this study, the police profiled suicidal
persons by drawing upon four psychosocial circumstances

and characteristics they adduced to suicidal behavior: needy,
enigmatic, ignorant, and blameworthy.
Needy. Some police personnel (n = 10) profiled suicidal per-
sons as individuals in need of help. Drawing on facts gath-
ered from previous suicide-related crime investigations, the
police reported that persons experiencing suicidal crisis are
pushed by their unmet psychological, social, and/or material
needs to engage in suicide. When these needs are expressed
by the individual but remain unmet or unrecognized by sig-
nificant others, the result is an enduring psychological pain
(psychache) as asserted by Shneidman (1993). A police offi-
cer illustrated this as follows:
They [suicidal persons] are people who are in need, they need to
be helped. You need to have time, listen to them and then you
will know the cause, the reason behind their attempt to commit
suicide. When you listen to them you might be of help but if you
just look at the face value and dismiss it, it's not the right way.
(Male, 28 years).
The opinion above points to the fact that persons experienc-
ing suicidal crisis are usually in need, requiring help of some
sort, and the need can be identified by a potential helper who
genuinely listens to and empathizes with the suicidal person.
Implicitly, the opinion further highlights as unhelpful atti-
tude of condemnation and trivialization usually shown by
significant others toward persons experiencing suicidal cri-
sis. For example, in Ghana, families tend to sharply condemn
a member who attempts suicide, instead of making empathic
efforts to understand the reasons for the behavior and/or pro-
vide support (Asare-Doku, 2016). This is owed to the fact
that families view suicidal behavior as a social injury and as
such families become more concerned with protecting their
social image and status against stigma and shame (Osafo,
2016b; Osafo, Akotia, Andoh-Arthur, & Quarshie, 2015;
Osafo, Hjelmeland, Akotia, & Knizek, 2011). A shameful
behavior is perceived contagious because the self is defined
in reference to others (Gyekye, 1995). Consequently, a strong
disavowal of suicidal behavior is a commonplace in most
Ghanaian communities (Osafo, 2016a). Thus, the expressed
needs of suicidal persons remain unnoticed and unaddressed,
thereby pushing them further into attempting suicide.
Another police officer shared a case as follows: "Last year, a
houseboy just hanged himself. When we investigated the
incident, we found that the guy was suffering, financially"
(Male, 36 years). In Ghana, a houseboy is usually a young
adult male from a rural area with little or no formal educa-
tion, who is hired by a middle- or higher-class urban family
to perform, usually, multiple roles within the household: a
watchman, gardener, cook, driver, steward, and/or gate-
keeper (Tsikata, 2011). Houseboys (like other domestic
workers in Ghana) receive paltry salaries, which are some-
times not paid consistently at the elapse of time (Tsikata,
2009). However, a houseboy usually has dependents (e.g.,
wife and children or extended relations) to provide for.
Generally, domestic workers in Ghana are categorized within
the informal sector of the economy, and thus lack any explicit
labor and employment legislation or institution providing
them with job security and protection (Tsikata, 2009, 2011).
The implication is that a domestic worker lacks any legiti-
mate right to negotiate for pay increase or improvement in
the general conditions of work, even in the face of the harsh
economic realities across the country. Coroner investigations
in the aftermath of suicide involve some kind of sociological
and psychological autopsies--soliciting the views of signifi-
cant others regarding the palpable life situation and behavior
of the deceased days/months before the suicide (Scourfield,
Fincham, Langer, & Shiner, 2012). In the above case in
point, it is plausible that the financial problem of the deceased
might have been reported to the investigators because while
alive the deceased (directly or indirectly) expressed his
financial needs to significant others, but received no help.
Consequently, the houseboy in the case in point might have
equated his financial difficulties to a lack of achievement or
a loss of his ability to provide for his dependents (or even
himself), presupposing a gross infraction of the social expec-
tation of masculinity. In Ghana, one of the indices of a suc-
cessful masculinity is a demonstration of the ability to take
care of others, and inability to do this invokes social dishonor
for a man (Adomako Ampofo & Boateng, 2007). Hence,
consistent with previous observation of suicidality among
Ghanaian men (e.g., Adinkrah, 2012a; Osafo et al., 2015),
the houseboy in the above case might have killed himself to
avoid any such dishonor to loss of masculinity and dignity of
manliness. Thus, people who attempt suicide are, sometimes,
persons whose expressed needs are not recognized or remain
unattended to by significant others.
Enigmatic.The police officers (n = 7) further profiled sui-
cidal persons as enigmatic--mysterious and elusive persons
whose behaviors are difficult to understand and also predict.
According to the police officers, a person experiencing sui-
cidal crisis shows no visible eccentric behavior or any sign of
suicidal intention, thereby making it very difficult (if not
impossible) for significant others to identify to offer any
needed timely help or intervention. A police officer reported,
Recently, a police inspector hanged himself. It was very, very
shocking, because I saw him personally the night before he
killed himself. So we were all like, how? Somebody who
appeared to be very strong, and active. . . . We were all surprised
and traumatized because we did not suspect him to be like that.
(Male, 34 years)
The shock and surprise as indicated by this participant are
predicated on the absence of warning signs of suicidal crisis
and recent interaction with the deceased. Perhaps clear indi-
cation of an impending suicidal crisis would have prepared
this participant and others to perhaps provide support for the
Osafo et al. 5
deceased. Implicit in the quote is an expectation that the
deceased should have shared his crisis with others to enlist
their support (Osafo et al., 2011). Accordingly, another offi-
cer remarked, "to every problem there is a solution, so peo-
ple should be open to confide in friends, relatives and share
their problems. The best way to solve a problem is not to
commit suicide" (Female, 31 years). An assumption implic-
itly held by this participant is that suicidal persons are obliged
to seek early help from their close relatives, because such
social supports are available. Her recommendation appears
heavily laden with values and moral imperatives within her
sociocultural context. But in light of the widespread condem-
nation and stigma toward suicidal persons in Ghana
(Adinkrah, 2012a, 2012b; Osafo, 2016b; Osafo et al., 2011),
the utility of such suggestion might be questionable.
Ignorant.The police officers in this study (n = 9) reported
that some people experiencing suicidal crisis go on to attempt
suicide or kill themselves mainly because they are naïve as to
the availability of expert workable alternative solutions to
the unmet needs fueling their crisis. As opined by an officer,
They [suicidal persons] lack knowledge. When people don't
have enough education or enough ideas about something then
they turn around to do what they understand. Yes, because
people don't have knowledge on how to control or manage the
stress and troubles they are going through, they feel that the best
way is to take their lives, after all, "all die be die." (Male, 43
years)
This participant views a suicidal person as bereft of insight in
existential struggles, and that such ignorance is often the
cause for suicidality. As he implied, a well-thought-through
solution to crisis in life should lead to a resolve to pursue life
and living than dying. He makes reference to a pervasive folk
knowledge (owuo biara y owuo or "all die be die") to illus-
trate the apathy toward healthy lifestyle, and thus a manifes-
tation of the ignorance he was expounding. There is evidence
elsewhere in Ghana that illustrates, for example, that such
kinds of folk knowledge which belittles personal efforts in
improving health attitudes are easily adopted by people at
risk of HIV/AIDS to neutralize campaign efforts, programs,
and messages aimed at promoting safer sex and reducing
HIV infection in Ghana (Awusabo-Asare, Abane, Badasu, &
Anarfi, 1999). Such mundane understandings provide the
lexica for the understanding and expression of suicidal (and
other mental health) crises and the frame of reference for
managing them (Konradsen, van der Hoek, & Peiris, 2006;
Marecek, 1998). In general, his view that suicidal persons
are ignorant may be explained by lay understandings of sui-
cide in societies where mental health knowledge and services
are less developed and expert knowledge is absent from the
dominant social discourse on health issues (Marecek, 1998).
In addition, another police officer (female, 31 years)
reported, "most people who attempt or commit suicide don't
even know that it's against the laws of Ghana and God. So,
it's all about information and knowledge that they [suicidal
persons] don't have." This opinion underscored two facts: (a)
as observed in previous studies (e.g., Adinkrah, 2012b,
2016), most Ghanaians are not aware of the country's anti-
suicide law; and (b) although Ghana may be described as a
religious country by behavior and practices (see Gilani,
Shahid, & Zuettel, 2012), people who attempt or commit sui-
cide do not seem to know that the act is a religious transgres-
sion. Perhaps she is asserting that awareness of these
proscriptive imperatives would have deterred the suicidal
person. Such kind of ignorance, as she espouses, reflects lack
of information about the prohibitive normative structures
against the act. Such view reflects a superficial, informa-
tional knowledge gap more than the lack of generalized
insight for living intimated earlier by the male participant
(male, 43 years). Generally, as observed in other LAMICs
with antisuicide laws, illiteracy is high and most people do
not know that suicidal behavior is a punishable crime (Latha
& Geetha, 2004).
Blameworthy.
Saliency analysis (Buetow, 2010) of the
responses by four of the police officers (n = 4) as to what
motivates people to attempt/commit suicide revealed that
"completed" and attempted suicides are consequential to the
blameworthy conducts of suicidal persons. According to
these police officers, some people experience suicidal crisis
because of certain self-defeating lifestyle choices they have
made and habits they have formed over time. In a police offi-
cer's opinion,
There is no influence from anywhere . . . If you choose to be an
alcohol man [sic] and you take alcohol and get very drunk, then
you cannot control your brain. So whatever comes into your
mind you will do it. So, it depends on the choice of the individual
himself. (Male, 39 years)
In the above quote, the police officer appeared to suggest that
the precursors and agency in suicidal behavior lie entirely
within the individual. The power to refrain from attempting/
committing suicide belongs to and is wielded entirely by the
individual, unless the individual willingly relinquishes that
control or personal sense of agency through the adoption of a
self-defeating habit or lifestyle: alcoholism. Alcoholism has
been implicated as having a significant influence on the sui-
cidal process, especially among men in Sub-Saharan Africa
(Kizza, Hjelmeland, Kinyanda, & Knizek, 2012; Knizek,
Kinyanda, Owens, & Hjelmeland, 2011; Ovuga, Boardman,
& Wasserman, 2007). People with chronic alcoholism tend
to lose their sense of personal control during suicidal crisis
and go on to kill themselves following a suicidal motivation
(Kizza, Hjelmeland, et al., 2012; Kizza, Knizek, Kinyanda,
& Hjelmeland, 2012; Knizek, Akotia, & Hjelmeland, 2011).
Although all the police officers in this study considered
attempted suicide as a criminal offense, generally those who
6 SAGE Open
profiled suicidal persons as needy, enigmatic, and ignorant
appeared to base the culpability of the suicidal person on fac-
tors beyond the control of the individual suicidal person
(e.g., economic and financial difficulties, intense social
stigma, etc.). Hence, such persons need to be helped rather
than punished. However, police officers who profiled sui-
cidal persons as blameworthy considered such persons as
entirely culpable of the offense, requiring arrest, conviction,
and punishment by the law.
Police Position on the Law
This superordinate theme relates to the police officers'
responses to the question, "What is your view on the law
criminalizing attempted suicide in Ghana?" All the police
officers in this study indicated their awareness of the existing
law criminalizing attempted suicide in Ghana and showed
fair understanding of the reasoning behind its promulgation.
Majority (n = 14) of the police officers disagreed with the
law and suggested a repeal, whereas a few (n = 4) of them
agreed with the law and thus suggested it should be main-
tained. Drawing on how they profiled suicidal persons and
their understanding of the rationale behind the law, the police
officers provided reasons for or against the law criminalizing
attempted suicide in Ghana.
Reasons for maintaining the law. Police officers who, largely,
profiled suicidal persons as blameworthy agreed with the law
criminalizing attempted suicide in Ghana, and therefore sug-
gested that the law should be maintained because of its deter-
rent effect and on grounds of protecting lives.
Deterrent effect.Here, police officers argued that main-
taining the law and sanctioning perpetrators would serve to
deter others from attempting suicide. For instance, "I agree
with the law because when you are caught and punished for
attempted suicide, it will deter others who will also have
the idea or perceive to do it" (male, 38 years). The probable
assumption undergirding this reasoning is that sometimes
people learn by imitating the behaviors of others based on
the (positive social) consequences following the imitated
behavior (Bandura & Walters, 1977). So, generally, a person
would refrain from modeling the behavior of a significant
other if the behavior is followed by punishment or unpleas-
ant consequences.
Protecting lives. Police officers who provided this reason
for the keeping of the law took an ethical position of judging
attempted suicide in the light of rules governing human life.
For example,
It is a crime to kill, whether you attempt to kill someone or you
attempt to kill yourself. You don't have the right to kill. So if you
attempt killing yourself and the law gets you, you will be
punished. (Female, 25 years)
The police officer of the above opinion essentially equated
"completed" suicide/attempted suicide to murder/attempted mur-
derwithinthepurviewofthelaw.Bothactsinvolvedtaking(oran
attempt at taking) human life, which is forbidden by the law.
Reasons for a repeal of the law. Predominantly, police officers
who profiled suicidal persons as needy, enigmatic, and igno-
rant disagreed with the law. According to these officers, the
law criminalizing attempted suicide in Ghana should be
repealed because the law prevents reporting of suicide and it
is inefficient in providing support.
The law prevents reporting of suicide.Police officers who
advanced this reason for disagreeing with the law reflected on
the general inhibitory effect of the law and the considerable
stigma associated with suicidal behavior in Ghana. As narrated
by an officer, "people don't report it because it is a disgrace to
the family and also because of the police. Therefore, most times
when it happens people try to say somebody else killed the per-
son" (male, 41 years). Fear of marring the family social image
(Osafo, 2016b) converges with prosecution from the police to
inhibit people from reporting suicidal behavior and perhaps
also seek early help. Data that could be helpful to inform sui-
cide prevention programs may thus be hampered. Another par-
ticipant also explains the dynamics of fear of the law and how
it further blocks the evidence for eventual prosecution:
Suicide attempt is about evidence. People would come and
report suicidal persons but they will not lead you to get the
evidence because they know when you get the evidence you will
be able to prosecute the person . . . (Male, 39 years)
Here, the participant espouses that fear to follow through
with evidence for prosecution is a challenge to the antisui-
cide law. The law thus becomes a "white elephant" because
fear of prosecution robs the police of the details of cases
reported as evidence. Generally, Ghanaians show an intense
hesitation to involving the police in family affairs, possibly
because of the fear of stigma, abuse of power, or incarcera-
tion of family members (Boateng & Lee, 2014).
The law is insensitive. The argument here is that the anti-
suicide law is insensitive to the mental health needs of sui-
cidal persons. For instance,
I don't think anybody will just wake up and try to end his or her
own life. If somebody wants to commit suicide and you
compound it by sentencing the person then what are you doing?
I think those who attempt suicide should not be treated like that.
We should find a way of counseling them . . . As a society, we
have to provide the needs for the person to come out of his
problems. (Male, 48 years)
The above opinion alluded to the fact that suicidal behavior
is caused by some unmet needs or malaise in the life of
Osafo et al. 7
suicidal persons. Again, the antisuicide law of Ghana is only
punitive, as it does not provide for, even, the chance for men-
tal health assessment, apart from police investigation toward
the establishment of criminal evidence tenable in court.
Given that Ghana's prisons are in deplorable state and less
supportive of inmates, a person convicted on the grounds of
attempted suicide may return from jail with worse mental
health outcomes. In place of the unsupportive antisuicide
law, the police argued that society must devise ways to
address the unmet needs which motivate suicidal behavior in
the first place. In the view of another police officer,
People do not even understand why they should be prosecuted
for attempting to take their own lives. Sometimes they ask,
"when I had problems I got nobody to help me but when I tried
to kill myself (but not someone else) the government has come
in to arrest me?" So, personally I think it [the law] should be
amended in a way to meet the needs of people who are going
through suicidal tendencies. (Female, 38 years)
In the above quote, the participant highlights an inherent
paradox the public finds in the antisuicide law: The law is
dormant when people are experiencing distress but suddenly
springs up when an incident occurs, transforming a person in
crisis into a criminal. This appears to inform his view for
calling for a reform of the law.
Gatekeeping Posturing
This theme highlights the implicit attitudes of the police offi-
cers in this study toward the enforcement of the antisuicide
law when they receive information about suicide attempt.
Almost all the police officers in this study, regardless of how
they profiled suicidal persons and their position on the antisui-
cide law, appeared to have an implicit attitude of either hope
inspiration or diversion as illustrated in the following quotes:
We've been encountering people who have become suicidal
every now and then, especially, people who try to commit
suicide . . . We talk to them in our own small ways about
alternative ways of managing their difficulties, although we are
not professional counselors . . . Personally, I've been using the
Word of God because the Bible says that the Word of God heals,
so I speak the Word of God to them so that they will be healed.
(Female, 43 years)
I once handled a case of suicide attempt. What happened was that,
when the man attempted suicide the first time, I counseled him,
and I invited his relatives to the station and we arranged for him to
see a psychologist also for help.After that we discharged him to his
family. But after some time, like three months, he made another
attempt. This time when the case came to me, I sent him to court
and he was sentenced to six months in prison. (Male, 41 years)
Both quotes above have one common thing: The police offi-
cers, at the encounter of an attempted suicide case (at least in
the first instance), tried to informally "fix the situation"
without effecting any arrest or the full enforcement of the
law. In the first quote, the police officer appeared not to apply
the law at all, whereas in the second quote, the police officer
engaged in diversion until a recurrence of the suicide attempt.
Prosecuting and jailing the suicidal person in the second
quote indicate the frustration experienced by police officers
who handle repeat attempters and the lack of expert knowl-
edge and understanding of suicidal behavior on the part of
the police.
Discussion
Three key findings emerged from this study. First, the police
in this study profiled suicidal persons differently (persons
who are needy, enigmatic, ignorant, and blameworthy).
Second, the study reveals that contrasting views on the law
criminalizing suicide attempt (law be repealed vs. law be
maintained) existed among the police. The third key finding
shows a common inclination of the police toward "helping"
instead of "arresting" suicide attempters in spite of the con-
trasting views about suicidal persons and the laws criminal-
izing the act.
All the police in this study viewed suicide attempt as a
breach of the law. However, majority of the police officers (n
= 14) reflect and draw on their understanding of the psycho-
logical and sociocultural precursors of suicidal crises to pro-
file suicidal persons as needy, enigmatic, and ignorant
offenders of the law. The import of these profiles is that sui-
cidal persons cannot be held responsible for their offense
because they are motivated by unmet needs and factors
beyond their control. These police officers, therefore, appear
sympathetic and supportive of suicidal persons. As observed
in previous studies (e.g., Latha & Geetha, 2004), a person
driven to attempt suicide by factors beyond his or her control
(e.g., financial difficulties, poverty/unemployment, endoge-
nous biological causes, love problems, setbacks in marriage,
and family or other such reasons) may be implicated under
the antisuicide law but cannot be held accountable for the
suicidal behavior. Thus, guided by the parens patriae prin-
ciple of policing, the majority of the police in the present
study try to informally help to ameliorate the suicidal crisis
of an offender by attempting to help the suicidal person.
Hence, these police officers refrain from arresting suicide
attempters. However, the few police officers in this study
who viewed the suicidal persons as blameworthy found the
suicidal person culpable for incarceration. The blameworthy
offender is perceived as entirely responsible for the act and
considered dangerous to other members of the community.
In this case, the police power function principle informs the
police decision to arrest, prosecute, and punish the suicidal
person to ensure the greater safety of the rest of the commu-
nity. This blameworthy position may be problematic because
the presence of mental illness and distress in suicidality have
been established. Consequently, suicidal crisis may represent
a cry for help as well as a means of, or communicating,
8 SAGE Open
distress to significant others for help (Latha & Geetha, 2004;
WHO, 2014). Incarceration will only amount to worsening
the person's mental health state.
The finding that majority of the police officers in this
study disagreed with Ghana's antisuicide law supports previ-
ous evidence (i.e., Hjelmeland et al., 2014) on the subject
matter in Ghana where some of the participating police offi-
cers in the study agreed with the antisuicide law, whereas a
greater number of them disagreed with the law and called for
a repeal. In the present study, the argument for keeping the
antisuicide law is anchored in utilitarian arguments for pun-
ishing to ensure the greater good for the greatest number of
people (Carlsmith, Darley, & Robinson, 2002; Mensah-
Bonsu, 2001). It must serve the purpose of punishing the per-
ceived criminal nature of suicidality, as they implied, and
eventually reduce the occurrence of the act in the country. It
is worthy of note that although the sanctity of human life
demands that life must be respected and as such the law must
deal with anyone who willfully takes (or attempts to take)
life, criminal law serves no purpose in the mental health
problem of suicide (Latha & Geetha, 2004; WHO, 2014). To
date, no data or study has shown any clear cause­effect rela-
tionship or correlation between any antisuicide law and
deterrent of suicidal behavior (WHO, 2014). What is clear is
that people experiencing suicidal crisis are rather deterred
from seeking help, keep their suicidal intentions secret, stig-
matized, and punished by the law (Adinkrah, 2012b, 2016;
Aggarwal, 2015; WHO, 2014). Thus, persons experiencing
suicidal crisis need to be helped but not punished. The
(potential) benefits of repealing the antisuicide law may far
outstrip those (if any) associated with the keeping of the anti-
suicide law (WHO, 2014). For example, people in suicidal
crisis are likely to seek early help which may provide us with
data for designing prevention and intervention schemes. This
resonates with the observation in the present study where
majority (77.8%) of the police officers indicated that the
antisuicide law of Ghana prevents reporting of suicide and it
is insensitive to the needs of the suicidal person. As admon-
ished by WHO (2014),
It is possible that decriminalization will increase the reporting of
suicides once fear of legal recriminations is eliminated. This allows
for more accurate estimates of the true extent of the issue. When
suicide is considered a criminal act, suicide attempts are often
hidden and suicide deaths are unreported, thus giving the false
impression that suicidal behaviours are less prevalent. (p. 51)
Therefore, the conviction is that decriminalizing attempted
suicide, potentially, would (among other benefits) embolden
people experiencing suicidal crisis to seek professional help,
as the social stigma would be reduced considerably (if not
eliminated).
Although the police in this study perceive suicide attempt
as a threat to both the suicidal person and (at least, the social
image of) the community in which it occurs, the police
implicit attitude of hope inspiration and diversion highlights
the application of the parens patriae principle. In this
instance, the police perceive suicidal persons as citizens who
are in need and unable to help themselves, but not as crimi-
nals to be arrested, put before the law court, and punished.
Thus, the principle of parens patriae influences and informs
the discretion of the police to, informally, offer help to meet
the needs of suicidal persons. This observation is consistent
with previous findings (e.g., Cotton, 2004; Green, 1997;
Psarra et al., 2008; Teplin & Pruett, 1992). Another plausible
reason for this gatekeeping posturing manifested through
hope inspiration and diversion relates to the practical reali-
ties of policing. The police spend relatively less of their time
on criminal law enforcement duties (Green, 1997). They
spend the greater chunk of their time and resources on regu-
latory issues and cases, including traffic control and activi-
ties broadly described as peacekeeping. In this vein, criminal
offenses involving mental health problems (e.g., suicidal
behaviors) do not provoke serious application of the criminal
law or regulatory control. Rather, police officers judge such
cases as analogous to public nuisance, requiring the police
officer to make efforts to fix the situation by helping to ame-
liorate the crisis of the suicidal person (Green, 1997; Teplin
& Pruett, 1992).
Conclusion and Implications
Suicidal behavior is viewed by the police in this study as an
infraction of the law but not a crime punishable by criminal
law. Thus, majority of the police in this study disagree with
the antisuicide law of Ghana, calling for a repeal to encour-
age the reporting of suicide and to help meet the needs of
suicidal persons. Thus, the police attempt to help, rather than
arrest and prosecute, attempters of suicide in Ghana.
Contemporary principles of law and punishment have wit-
nessed a paradigm shift from deterrent to reformation (Latha
& Geetha, 2004); therefore, the time has come for the legis-
lature of Ghana to consider repealing the country's antisui-
cide law, Section 57, Subsection II, of Act 29, The Criminal
Code of Ghana (1960).
Based on the findings of this study, a couple of useful
implications for practice, policy, and research can be iden-
tified. Regarding practice, the expression of frustration in
the handling of suicide persons as revealed in some of the
voices in the study points to inadequate evidence-based
expert knowledge about suicide and suicidal persons. This
calls for increased suicide literacy and training aimed at
equipping the police in the handling of suicidal persons in
the line of their professional duties. While training of
police, may enhance their awareness of the needs of sui-
cide attempters and sharpen police's responsiveness in
dealing with such persons, it may also help foster collabo-
ration with suicide researchers in the timely release of sui-
cide information for purposes of intervention and treatment
(Green, 1997). Recent evidence (e.g., Marzano et al., 2016;
Osafo et al. 9
Spence & Millott, 2016) shows that police education and
training related to suicide and mental health are helpful in
improving police attitudes and confidence, and increasing
their skills and knowledge in handling suicidal persons.
Thus, suicidologists (and other allied professionals) in
Ghana may consider organizing gatekeeper training work-
shops for the police in this regard. A recent study in Ghana,
for instance, has revealed a double-edged role of the police
in matters relating to suicide. On one hand, the police can
be key allies for helping people bereaved by suicide, while
on the other hand, their presence can induce fear leading to
further invulnerabilities (Andoh-Arthur, Hjelmeland,
Knizek, & Osafo, 2016). However, effective training of the
police in proscriptive and resource poor contexts, as rec-
ommended in the study above, potentially may help
enhance police gatekeeping roles in two ways: for research
purposes regarding access to data and suicidal persons, and
for suicide prevention purposes regarding diversion of sui-
cidal persons into the mental health system (Andoh-Arthur
et al., 2016; Osafo et al., 2017). On policy, the Ghana
Police Council and the Ghana Police Service may consider
including in the curriculum for training police personnel
elective courses on handling persons with mental problems
(including suicidal persons) who break the law. The
courses should be mandatory and that periodic training on
intervention and de-escalation should be part of their cur-
riculum. Police officers, within this framework, could be
therefore patient and empathic in the handling of attempt
survivors. The police service stands to benefit, a great deal,
from this in terms of good exchange between persons in
suicidal crisis and police personnel who double as gate-
keepers in suicide prevention (Marzano et al., 2016;
Omoaregba et al., 2015; Teplin & Pruett, 1992).
This study could not sample a larger number of police
officers to participate in the study mainly because of the
busy nature of the work of the officers. As qualitative
researchers, we do not discount the use of large sample in
research (Sandelowski, 2001). However, our focus in this
exploratory study (which is part of a larger study, N = 500)
was aimed at understanding the views of a hard-to-reach
but powerful professional group whose views and actions
have significant implications for the law on suicide
attempts. We are convinced that the findings of this study
represent a fair reflection of the views of the police on sui-
cidal persons and the antisuicide law in this study and
would be useful in training them as gatekeepers in suicide
prevention. Future studies aimed at expanding the evi-
dence base to push for the decriminalization of suicidal
behavior in Ghana may consider soliciting the views of
other gatekeepers and persons who have primary contact
with suicidal persons and the law in Ghana. These include
medical doctors, prisons officers, lawyers, judges, and
members of Parliament.
