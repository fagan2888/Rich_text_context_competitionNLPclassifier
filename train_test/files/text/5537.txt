Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with multi-drug resistant
tuberculosis (MDR­TB) in Dalian, China.
Methods: This was a retrospective review of data from patients attending a TB clinic in Dalian,
China between 2012 and 2015. Demographic and drug susceptibility data were retrieved from TB
treatment cards. Univariate logistic analysis was used to assess the association between risk factors
and MDR­TB.
Results: Among the 3552 patients who were smear positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB),
2918 (82.2%) had positive MTB cultures and 1106 (31.1%) had isolates that showed resistance to at
least one drug. The overall prevalence of MDR­TB was 10.1% (359/3552; 131/2261 [5.8%] newly
diagnosed and 228/1291 [17.7%] previously treated patients). Importantly, 75 extensively drug-
resistant TB isolates were detected from 25 newly treated and 50 previously treated patients. In
total, 215 (6.1%) patients were infected with a poly-resistant strain of MTB. Previously treated
patients and older patients were more likely to develop MDR­TB.
Conclusions: The study showed a high prevalence of MDR­TB among the study population.
History of previous TB treatment and older age were associated with MDR­TB.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health
problem.1 Although many efforts have been
made over the past 20 years to control TB,
worldwide, there were an estimated 9 million
new incident cases of TB in 2014.1 The
emergence of drug resistant TB over recent
years has become a major threat in the
control of the disease.2 Two important types

of drug resistant TB have been identified,
multi-drug resistant (MDR)­TB and exten-
sively drug-resistant (XDR)­TB. MDR­TB
strains are resistant to isoniazid and rifam-
pin, the standard, first-line drug treatments
for TB; and XDR­TB stains are resistant
to isoniazid and rifampin, at least one
fluoroquinolone and any of the second-line
injectable treatments (i.e. amikacin, capreo-
mycin, kanamycin).3 The World Health
Organization (WHO) estimated that in
2014 there were 4.8 million new cases of
MDR­TB worldwide and approximately 1.9
million associated deaths.4 Moreover, com-
pared with drug-susceptible TB, treatment
for MDR­TB and XDR­TB can cost up to
25 times more and take three times longer to
be effective.5,6 Importantly, only approxi-
mately 20% of MDR­TB cases are correctly
diagnosed and the strains are highly
transmissible.7
With an estimated total number of 130 548
cases in 2014, China has the largest number of
TB and MDR­TB cases in the world.4
However, the drug resistance rate estimated
by the WHO is inadequate for TB control for
China.1 Therefore, a study was conducted to
determine the prevalence and characteristics
of drug-resistant TB in a specific region in
China with the aim of providing more accur-
ate data on TB surveillance. Data from a TB
centre in Dalian, a coastal city in the north-
east of China with approximately 7 million
inhabitants and a growing number of
drug-resistant TB cases, were used to analyse
drug-resistant TB and identify potential risk
factors, especially for MDR­TB.
Patients and methods
Study design and patient population
This was a retrospective review of data from
TB patients attending TB treatment clinics in
Dalian, Liaoning Province, China between
January 2012 and December 2015. Patient
characteristics and details of drug suscepti-
bility tests were retrieved from TB treatment
cards and recorded by three researchers
(X.T.L., X.Y.S., and X.W.L.). Newly treated
patients were defined as those who had either
never received anti-TB treatment or had
received treatment for less than 1 month.
Previously treated patients were defined as
those who had received treatment for more
than 1 month.1 The retrospective nature of
this study and that it used anonymized data
meant that it did not require ethical commit-
tee approval or patient consent.
Microbiological methods
Two sputum samples had been collected
from each patient with suspected TB. One of
the samples, usually the first unless it was of
poor quality, was used for culture. Smear
microscopy and culture had been performed
by a local laboratory while drug resistance
testing had been conducted at a specialist
centre. The Ziehl­Neelsen stain was used to
confirm the presence of acid-fast bacilli in
sputum smears. Positive smear samples
were then cultured on Lo
¨ wenstein­Jensen
(LJ) culture medium with and without
p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNB). Growth of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is
inhibited by PNB, whereas non-tuberculosis
mycobacteria (NTM) are resistant.
Incubation was at 37 C for up to 8 weeks
and the cultures were checked weekly for the
growth of mycobacteria. Samples contain-
ing NTM were excluded from the study.
Drug susceptibility testing was performed
on LJ medium impregnated with isoniazid
(INH), rifampin (RIF), streptomycin (SM),
ethambutol (EMB), ofloxacin (OFL) and
kanamycin (KM) according to the propor-
tion method as recommended by the WHO.8
The concentrations of anti-TB drugs used
were 0.2 mg/l for INH, 40 mg/l for RIF,
2 mg/l for EMB, 4 mg/l for SM, 2 mg/l for
OFL, and 2 mg/l for KM. Any drug-
resistant TB was defined as resistance to any
of the anti-TB drugs among the six drugs
recommend by the WHO (i.e. INH, RIF,
1780 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
EMB, SM, OFL or KM).4 Mono-resistance
was defined as resistance to only one drug and
poly-resistance was defined as resistance to
two or more drugs excluding INH and RIF.
Statistical analyses
Data analyses were performed using IBM
SPSS software, version 19.0, for WindowsÕ
(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Between
group comparisons were made using 2-test
and univariate logistic regression analysis
was performed to assess the association
between several risk factors and MDR­TB.
A P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate
statistical significance.
Results
In total, 3552 smear positive patients were
included in this retrospective study of
whom, 2918 (82.2%) had positive MTB
cultures. Of these 2918 patients, 1920 were
new TB cases and 998 were previously
treated patients. The sample was
predominantly male (2232 men, 686
women) and the mean Æ SD age was
50.79 Æ 17.07 years.
Drug resistance status for all 3552 smear
positive patients is shown in Table 1. Of the
3552 patients, 1106 (31.1%) had resistance
to at least one of the six tested anti-TB
drugs. Previously treated patients were sig-
nificantly more likely to have drug resistance
(43.4% [560/1291]) compared with newly
treated patients (24.1% [546/2261])
(P < 0.01). The overall prevalence of
MDR­TB was 10.1% (359/3552), of which
5.8% (131/2261) were newly treated patients
and 17.7% (228/1291) were previously
treated patients. Importantly, 75 (2.1%)
patients had XDR­TB isolates of whom 25
(1.1%) were newly treated patients and 50
(3.9%) were previously treated patients.
In addition, 215 (6.1%) patients had a
poly-resistant strain of MTB; 5.4% (123/

(92/1291) of previously treated patients.
More than half the patients with smear
positive TB (54.3%; 1930/3552) were in the
31­59-year age group. The age ranges for
patients with any drug resistant isolates dif-
fered significantly (P < 0.001) compared with
all smear positive patients (Table 2). While
more men than women (75.5% versus 24.5%,
respectively) had smear positive TB results, a
similar proportion of men and women
(31.3% versus 30.5%, respectively) had drug
resistant isolates. However, the difference was
not statistically significant (Table 2). Similar
results were found for patients with MDR­
TB; the age ranges differed significantly
(P < 0.05) from all smear positive patients
and the proportion of men and women with
MDR­TB isolates was comparable (10.3%
versus 9.4%, respectively) (Table 3).
Factors associated with the development
of any drug resistance were investigated and
previous anti-TB treatment was the most
significant (odds ratio [OR] 3.20, 95%
confidence interval [95% CI] 2.72, 3.76;
P < 0.001) (Table 4). Being in the oldest
age group ( ! 60 years) was the next most
significant factor associated with any resist-
ance (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09, 1.56; P < 0.01].
Sex was not associated with development of
any drug resistance.
Factors associated with the development
of MDR­TB were investigated and previous
anti-TB treatment was the most significant
(OR 4.44, 95% CI 3.57, 5.53; P < 0.001)
(Table 5). Being in either of the older two
age groups (31­59 and ! 60 years) was also a
significant factor (P < 0.05). Sex was
not associated with the development of
MDR­TB.
The prevalence of drug resistant tubercu-
losis in Dalian, China over the years 2012­
2015 is shown in Table 6. The prevalence of
MDR­TB and XDR­TB decreased both in
newly treated patients and previously trea-
ted patients from 2012 to 2015.

Discussion
China has a high burden of TB and is a hot
spot region for MDR­TB infection.9 This
current study presented the rates of drug
resistance, including MDR­TB, collected
from a TB Centre in Dalian, China over
the period 2012 to 2015. The MDR­TB
prevalence rates (overall 10.1%; newly trea-
ted patients 5.8% and previously treated
patients 17.7%) were similar to those
reported previously from ten provinces in

China between 1996 and 2004 (overall 9.3%;
newly treated patients 5.4% and previously
treated patients 25.6%)10 and from a
national survey conducted in 2007 (overall
10.2%; newly treated patients 5.7% and
previously treated patients 25.6%).11
In countries that have an effective TB
control programme, the proportion of pre-
viously treated patients should be low.12
However, the proportion of previously trea-
ted TB patients that had any TB resistance
in this study was 43.4%. In addition, the
results showed that previously treated
patients were more likely to harbour drug-
resistant TB and MDR­TB than newly
treated patients. For example, the propor-
tion of previously treated patients with
MDR­TB was approximately four times
greater than that of newly treated patients
(17.7% versus 5.8%, respectively). The
results of a univariate logistic regression
analysis also showed that a history of pre-
vious treatment and older age were the most
significant factors associated with MDR­
TB. This finding is consistent with system-
atic reviews performed in Europe on risk
factors associated with MDR-TB13,14 and
surveys conducted in several countries by
the WHO.4,9,15
Importantly, the current investigation
found 75 patients had XDR­TB. XDR­TB
is associated with high morbidity and mor-
tality and requires individualized treatment
to address both first-line and second-line
treatment resistance.16,17 Surveillance data
from China on XDR­TB are scarce.18
However, China intends to expand an
effective treatment programme for MDR­
TB that is modelled on international best
practice in an attempt to decrease the
number of prevalent cases and reduce trans-
mission of drug-resistant M. tubercu-
losis.11,19 Although this current study
observed high rates of MDR­TB and
XDR­TB, particularly in previously treated
patients, there was also a gradual reduction
in prevalence over the years 2012­2015 in
both newly and previously treated patients.
Further studies on the changing drug resist-
ant rates are required.
The study had several limitations. For
example, risk factors for drug-resistant TB
and MDR­TB were limited to age, sex and
previous anti-TB treatment. In addition,
these current data were only collected from
Dalian and so may not reflect the situation
from the whole Liaoning Province. Also, a
proportion of culture negative samples for

MTB could have been due to extraneous
factors such as the quality of the micro-
scopic procedures, but overall this was not
thought to have caused a systemic bias.
However, further studies are required to
determine the effect of other factors such as
rural or urban location, education level,
coverage provided by the `directly observed
treatment, short course' treatment strategy,
smoking and concomitant diseases.
In conclusion, the rate of drug-resistant
TB in Dalian was close to the nationally
observed value.11 Previously treated patients
were more likely to develop drug-resistant
TB as were older patients. Thus, the timely
detection of drug resistance is of great
importance in order to optimize patient
treatment and to inform infection control
measures designed to block the transmission
of MDR­TB. Further work is required to
understand the social and environmental
determinants that contribute to high trans-
mission rates. Moreover, a systematic study
on the relationship between genotype and
drug resistance is needed.
