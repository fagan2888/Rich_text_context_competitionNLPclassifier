Background: In adults the metabolic syndrome im-
poses a substantial risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and
premature coronary heart disease. Even so, no national
estimate is currently available of the prevalence of this
syndrome in adolescents.
Objective: To estimate the prevalence and distribu-
tion of a metabolic syndrome among adolescents in the
United States.
Design and Setting: Analyses of cross-sectional data
obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (1988-1994), which was adminis-
tered to a representative sample of the noninstitutional-
ized civilian population of the United States.
Participants: Male and female respondents aged 12 to
19 years (n=2430).
Main Outcome Measures: The prevalence and dis-
tribution of a metabolic syndrome among US adoles-
cents, using the National Cholesterol Education Pro-
gram (Adult Treatment Panel III) definition modified
for age.
Results: The overall prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome among adolescents aged 12 to 19 years was 4.2%;
6.1% of males and 2.1% of females were affected (P=.01).
The syndrome was present in 28.7% of overweight ado-
lescents (body mass index [BMI], 95th percentile) com-
pared with 6.8% of at-risk adolescents (BMI, 85th to
95th percentile) and 0.1% of those with a BMI below
the 85th percentile (P.001). Based on population-
weighted estimates, approximately 910000 US adoles-
cents have the metabolic syndrome.
Conclusions: Perhaps 4% of adolescents and nearly 30%
of overweight adolescents in the United States meet these
criteria for a metabolic syndrome, a constellation of meta-
bolic derangements associated with obesity. These find-
ings may have significant implications for both public
health and clinical interventions directed at this high-
risk group of mostly overweight young people.

THE PREVALENCE of obesity
and diabetes mellitus
among adults in the United
States has increased dur-
ing the past decade.1 Re-
cent data indicate that 65% of the US adult
population is either overweight, defined
as a body mass index (BMI, calculated as
the weight in kilograms divided by the
height in meters squared) of 25 or more,
or obese (BMI  30).2 In children and ado-
lescents, the term overweight is used in
place of obese and is defined as a BMI at
or above the 95th percentile on age- and
sex-specific growth charts from the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention.3
Overweight tripled among US children be-
tween 1970 and 2000, and 15% of 6- to
19-year-olds are overweight according to
the most recent estimates.4 Obesity is es-
timated to cause approximately 300000
deaths annually, and its 1-year direct
and indirect costs are estimated to be $117
billion.5
Leaders in the emerging field of pre-
ventive cardiology have increasingly rec-
ognized obesity's role in adult cardiovas-
cular disease. Correspondingly, the
guidelines for adult cholesterol and the pri-
mary prevention of cardiovascular dis-
ease reflect this increased recognition of
obesity's role.6,7 The guidelines for cho-
lesterol also target the metabolic syn-
drome, a constellation of metabolic de-
rangements that predict both type 2
diabetes mellitus and premature coro-
nary artery disease, as a newly recog-
nized entity that warrants clinical inter-
vention. According to the National
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP, or

Adult Treatment Panel III [ATP III]), persons meeting
at least 3 of the following 5 criteria qualify as having the
metabolic syndrome: elevated blood pressure, a low high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, a high tri-
glyceride level, a high fasting glucose level, and abdomi-
nal obesity. Because of the increasing rates of adult obesity
and obesity's association with insulin resistance and type
2 diabetes, the NCEP panel stated that the metabolic syn-
drome will soon have a greater impact on premature coro-
nary artery disease than does tobacco.8 According to re-
cent estimates, the metabolic syndrome affects 22% of
the US adult population overall, including 7% of men and
6% of women in the 20- to 29-year age group.9
As childhood overweight increases,10,11 its medical
complications are becoming more common and more fre-
quently recognized.12-14 For example, the prevalence of
type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically among adoles-
cents in the past 20 years.13 Studies suggest that a sub-
stantial percentage of overweight children and adoles-
cents may be afflicted with the metabolic syndrome
because many have 1 or more of the following: an el-
evated triglyceride level, a low HDL cholesterol level, and
high blood pressure.15,16 Many overweight children also
have elevated insulin levels, indicating an increase in in-
sulin resistence.16 When one considers that autopsy stud-
ies have revealed that overweight in adolescence is as-
sociatedwithacceleratedcoronaryatherosclerosis,17 recent
trends become even more troubling.
The purpose of the current study is to estimate the
prevalence and distribution of a metabolic syndrome in
adolescents using a nationally representative sample of
the US population.
METHODS
Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994) were examined. The
NHANES III used a complex, multistage design to provide a
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian
population of the United States. Approximately 40000 per-
sons aged 2 months to 65 years or older were studied. Young
and old persons and ethnic minorities such as African Ameri-
cans and Mexican Americans were oversampled.18 After being
evaluated in a home interview to determine family medical
history, current medical conditions, and medication use, par-
ticipants were randomly assigned to undergo a morning, af-
ternoon, or evening examination at the mobile examination
centers. Morning participants were asked to fast for 8 hours;
afternoon and evening participants were asked to fast for 6
hours.
The details of the determination and analysis of triglyc-
eride levels, HDL cholesterol levels, and glucose values have
previously been described.9,19 For adolescents aged 17 years
and older, 6 seated blood pressure readings were taken in 2
separate settings. The household interviewer took 3 measure-
ments at the participant's home, and the study physician took
3 during the evaluation in the center. The first and fifth Korot-
koff sounds were used to represent the systolic and diastolic
values.18 We used the mean of these 6 measurements in these
analyses. Adolescents aged 12 to 16 years did not have their
blood pressure taken at home, and thus this age group had
only the 3 measurements taken by the physician. Again, the
mean was used. Height was measured in an upright position
with a stadiometer, and weight was measured at a standing
position using a self-zeroing scale (Mettler-Toledo, Inc, Co-
lumbus, Ohio). The waist circumference measurement was
made at the midpoint between the bottom of the rib cage and
above the top of the iliac crest. Measurements of waist circum-
ference were made for each subject at minimal respiration to
the nearest 0.1 cm.18 The Tanner stage of pubic hair develop-
ment was used as an indicator of sexual maturity because it
was obtained for both sexes.20 There was standardized train-
ing for physicians performing these examinations, and photo-
graphs and written descriptions were available for reference.
Pubic hair was staged from 1, representing immaturity, to 5,
for full maturity.20
The initial sample consisted of 3211 subjects aged 12 to
19 years, to whom the following exclusion criteria were ap-
plied: (1) had not fasted for 6 hours, (2) was currently preg-
nant, or (3) was taking medication classified as a blood glu-
cose regulator, such as insulin, androgens or anabolic steroids,
or adrenal corticosteroids. The final sample numbered 2430,
including some individuals with 1 or more excluding factors.
No children younger than 12 years were instructed to fast as
part of NHANES III.
DEFINITIONS
The criteria for the metabolic syndrome in adults specified by
NCEP's ATP III and the adapted definition used in this analy-
sis for adolescents aged 12 to 19 years are shown in Table 1.7
Because these criteria have never been formally defined or ap-
plied in children or adolescents, we modified the adult criteria
to the closest representative values obtainable from pediatric
reference data. In developing a definition for metabolic syn-
drome in adolescents,21 we considered reference values from
the NCEP Pediatric Panel report,22 the American Diabetes As-
sociation statement on type 2 diabetes in children and adoles-
cents,23 and the updated Task Force report on the diagnosis
and management of hypertension in childhood as well as ATP
III.8 Because no reference values for waist circumference exist
for adolescents or children, we analyzed all adolescents in the
data set who had a waist circumference recorded. We classi-
fied participants with a waist circumference at or above the
90th percentile value for age and sex from this sample popu-
lation as having abdominal obesity. Elevated systolic or dias-
tolic blood pressure was defined as a value at or above the
90th percentile for age, sex, and height.21 If subjects reported
current use of any antihypertensive drugs, they were labeled
as participants with elevated blood pressure. This approach of
counting participants taking medications was also used for
examining the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in adults

in the same national data set.9 The NCEP Report of the Expert
Panel on Blood Cholesterol Levels in Children and Adolescents22
and a table summarizing these values in a review by Styne14
were used to establish the criteria for cholesterol level abnor-
malities. The range of 35 to 45 mg/dL (0.91-1.16 mmol/L) is
given for borderline low HDL cholesterol levels for all sexes
and ages. In children aged 10 to 19 years, a borderline high
range for triglyceride levels is given as 90 to 129 mg/dL (1.02-
1.46 mmol/L). Therefore the midpoint value for HDL choles-
terol (40 mg/dL [1.03 mmol/L]) was used as a 10th per-
centile value, and the midpoint value for triglycerides (110
mg/dL [1.24 mmol/L]) was taken as the 90th percentile
value for age. The reference value for elevated fasting glucose
was taken from the American Diabetes Association guideline
of 110 mg/dL or higher (6.1 mmol/L).23
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Prevalence values were compared using the 2 test for propor-
tions for those children with and without the metabolic syn-
drome. Comparisons of means of continuous variables were done
with the t test. Children identified in the racial/ethnic cat-
egory "other" were included in the overall sample analyzed, but
this subsample was too small for meaningful analysis sepa-
rately. To account for the complex sampling design, SAS24 and
SUDAAN25 statistical software were used in the analysis, and
SUDAAN was used to apply sampling weights to produce na-
tional estimates.
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics associated with the meta-
bolic syndrome in bivariate analyses are shown in
Table 2. The overall prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome in adolescents was 4.2%. It was more common in
males (6.1%) than in females (2.1%) and was more fre-
quent in Mexican Americans (5.6%) and whites (4.8%)
than black subjects (2.0%). By region of the country,
the rate was highest in the West and Midwest and low-
est in the Northeast. Findings for age (12-14 years vs
15-19 years), Tanner stage by pubic hair, poverty level,
and parental history of diabetes and myocardial infarc-
tion were not significant. When stratified by BMI,
28.7% of overweight adolescents (BMI 95th percen-
tile for age and sex) met criteria for the metabolic syn-
drome. A comparison of the final sample with those
subjects who were excluded revealed only 1 difference
by demographic characteristics (BMI also did not dif-
fer): The percentage of African Americans was slightly
higher in the excluded group (18.9% vs 14.6% in the
overall sample; P=.05). The proportion of subjects with
1 or more abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome is
presented in Table 3. In this sample, 41% of subjects
had 1 or more of these risk factors, whereas 14% had 2
or more. There were no subjects who had all 5 of these
risk factors.
The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome by sex
and race/ethnicity is shown in the Figure. The preva-
lence among white (7.1%) and Mexican American
males (7%) was nearly the same, whereas black males
had the lowest rate at 2.6% (P=.003). Among females,
Mexican Americans (4.1%) had the highest rate,
whereas black females (1.4%) had the lowest rate
(P.001).
The distribution of each element of the metabolic
syndrome is shown in Table 4. Overall, high triglycer-
ide levels and low HDL cholesterol levels were most com-
mon, whereas high fasting glucose levels were the least
common. White adolescents had the highest rates of high
triglyceride levels (25.5%) and low HDL cholesterol lev-
els (26.1%). Mexican American subjects had the high-
est rate of abdominal obesity by waist circumference
(13.0%). Black adolescents had the highest proportion
of elevated blood pressure (6.2%). Adolescents with the
metabolic syndrome had a mean BMI of 30.1 and, on av-
erage, were at the 95.5th percentile for BMI by age and
sex (data not shown). Of those adolescents who ful-
filled these criteria for the metabolic syndrome, 25.2%
were at risk for overweight, by BMI, and 73.9% were over-
weight.

COMMENT
The metabolic syndrome has been called several other
names, including syndrome X, insulin resistance syn-
drome, dysmetabolic syndrome X, Reaven syndrome, and
the metabolic cardiovascular syndrome.15,26 Obesity, in-
sulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension are com-
mon to all. The World Health Organization used "meta-
bolic syndrome" in their 1998 report on diagnosis and
classification of diabetes mellitus.27 Both the World Health
Organization and ATP III chose this title for their con-
sensus definitions.7,27 We believe that this is the first study
to examine the prevalence and distribution of a meta-
bolic syndrome in a nationally representative sample of
US adolescents. Perhaps 4% of adolescents overall and
nearly 30% of overweight adolescents meet the criteria
for this syndrome, suggesting that almost 1 million ado-
lescents in the United States are affected.
The metabolic syndrome affects an estimated 47 mil-
lion American adults.9 The syndrome emerges when a
person's predisposition for insulin resistance is wors-
ened by increasing adiposity; dyslipidemia, elevated blood
pressure, and proinflammatory and prothrombotic prop-
erties result.28 Adults with this syndrome frequently
progress to type 2 diabetes and demonstrate markedly
increased risk for morbidity and mortality from cardio-
vascular disease.29-31 The metabolic syndrome in adults
is largely confined to the overweight population32 and rep-
resents a subgroup of obese persons who bear a level of
risk for cardiovascular disease that exceeds that of the
obese in general. An estimated 7% of men and 6% of
women aged 20 to 29 years are affected with the meta-
bolic syndrome,9 so our finding that 4% of those aged
12 to 19 years may have this syndrome should not be sur-
prising. Four previous regional studies of children that
relied on US and international samples demonstrated the
clustering of the risk factors for the metabolic syn-
drome and reported rates from 2% to 9%.33-36
Overweight has important implications for the fu-
ture health of our young people, especially in terms of
coronary heart disease and diabetes. The Pathobiologi-
cal Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth research
group, for example, found that overweight (by BMI) in
young men was associated with fatty streaks, raised le-
sions, and low-grade stenosis of the coronary arteries.17
In addition, studies have established that child and ado-
lescent obesity tracks into adulthood and also predicts
the metabolic syndrome in adults.37-39 Results of one of
the many reports from the Bogalusa Heart Study40 show
that when insulin concentrations are increased in child-
hood they tend to remain elevated in adulthood, and those
adults with consistently elevated insulin levels tend also
to have increased rates of obesity, hypertension, and dys-
lipidemia. In the present study, adolescents with the meta-
bolic syndrome had a mean BMI just above the 95th per-
centile; thus, they represent a fairly common clinical
problem, one likely to be encountered routinely by gen-
eral pediatricians.
Abdominal or centrally distributed fat is associated
with type 2 diabetes and a poor cardiovascular profile in
adults.41-45 In children, an increased waist circumfer-
ence has been shown to correlate with abnormal sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressures and elevated serum
levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein,
triglyceride, lipoprotein, and insulin, as well as lower
concentrations of HDL.36,46,47 The association between
the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and waist cir-
cumference is not only a reflection of the degree of obe-

sity but is also dependent on the regional distribution of
the excess body fat.48,49 Thus, because a more central dis-
tribution of fat correlates with worse cardiovascular risk
and waist circumference has been shown to be the stron-
gest correlate of central fat distribution in children,50 it
seems appropriate to use waist circumference in a pedi-
atric definition of metabolic syndrome. In fact, BMI is a
less sensitive indicator of fatness in children and fails to
account for fat distribution.51 Perhaps for these reasons,
an American Heart Association statement has recom-
mended the inclusion of waist circumference measure-
ments in evaluating children for insulin resistance or those
who manifest features resulting from insulin resistance
that constitute much of the metabolic syndrome.49
Given the growing concern about metabolic syn-
drome, coupled with the alarming increase in the preva-
lence of overweight in children and adults, it is not sur-
prisingthattheAmericanHeartAssociationsetforthaseries
of guidelines for promoting cardiovascular health as part
of comprehensive pediatric care.49,52,53 Evidence shows that
obesity and insulin resistance has already started "the clock
of coronary heart disease" in some adults, even before the
onsetofdiabetes.29 Wecannotdefinitelystatethatthiswould
be the case for overweight adolescents with the metabolic
syndrome according to our definition, but this seems likely
for many because the syndrome is a constellation of car-
diovascularriskfactors.Cluster-trackingstudieshaveshown
that multiple cardiovascular risk factors persist from child-
hood into adulthood in 25% to 60% of cases.54,55 One study
showedthatsubjectswhoeitherdevelopedorlosttheirrisk
factor clustering over time had significant changes in their
adiposity and lifestyle behaviors related to nutrition and
physical activity.55
The first limitation of the data we present is to con-
sider how to define the metabolic syndrome for pediatric
patients. The intent was to create a definition for meta-
bolic syndrome in adolescents for initial epidemiologic in-
vestigation and for possible future clinical consideration.
The concept was to identify borderline high (or border-
line low in the case of HDL) values for each criterion from
establishedguidelinesforchildrenandadolescents.Insome
instances, as with BMI, age- and sex-specific criteria are
recommended to identify abnormal patients.56,57 In con-
trast, in the case of glucose and serum cholesterol, screen-
ing guidelines give single specific cutoff values for iden-
tifying abnormal subjects.23,58,59 Although the rates of
abnormal cholesterol values in adolescent subjects may
seem higher than expected, 30% of adults from the same
data set had hypertriglyceridemia and 37% had a low HDL
cholesterol value according to the ATP III criteria for the
metabolic syndrome.9 There might also be concern that
the cholesterol cutoff values used might lead to some over-
estimation or underestimation, but there was no differ-
ence in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome between 12-
to 14-year-olds vs 15- to 19-year-olds (P=.92). When teen-
agers were stratified by Tanner stage, there was also no
statistical difference in the rates of this syndrome pheno-
type, but rates increased among Tanner 2 and Tanner 3
individuals and decreased among Tanner 4 and 5 sub-
jects. Although no national definition of the metabolic syn-
drome in adolescents currently exists, obesity treatment
guidelinesrecommendidentifyingyouthwithmedicalcom-
plications of their obesity.56,57 Even recent scientific state-
ments on cardiovascular disease prevention or obesity and
insulin resistance in children have not presented a defi-
nition of metabolic syndrome for research or clinical
application.49,52
Some other limitations to consider include the
cross-sectional nature of these data, which do not allow
causal inferences and limit any assumptions about the
duration of the existence of any of the criteria, such as
blood pressure or cholesterol level. Also, since NHANES
III was conducted, both obesity and type 2 diabetes have
become more common among adolescents,13,60 which may
mean that this clustering of risk factors may have a higher
prevalence now than it did during data collection. De-
spite subjects 12 years and older being instructed to fast,
just more than 700 subjects from the original sample had
to be eliminated for not fasting for at least 6 hours. Al-
though 6 hours of fasting may not be ideal, it allowed
a larger sample size to be analyzed by having subjects
from afternoon and evening examinations included.

Finally, it should be noted that owing to the low preva-
lence of the metabolic syndrome, some cell sizes were
small when stratified by demographic characteristics. Mul-
tiple prospective reports confirm that the clustering
of risk factors for the metabolic syndrome are develop-
ing during childhood,16,33,40,46,61 and studies of the meta-
bolic syndrome in adults show that its prevalence in-
creases with age.9
Our findings highlight a high percentage of over-
weight adolescents who may bear a heightened risk for
future metabolic syndrome in adulthood with subse-
quent increased risks for premature cardiovascular dis-
ease and type 2 diabetes. Consistent with recent com-
mentaries that have called for better ways to define
overweight in children,62 use of a consensus definition
for the metabolic syndrome to assess overweight adoles-
cents might be a useful strategy to target a group at in-
creased risk. Targeting adults with glucose intolerance
and other markers of the metabolic syndrome has been
employed in trials to prevent type 2 diabetes in adults.63-65
The high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in over-
weight adolescents, however, emphasizes the need for ef-
fective preventive and therapeutic strategies that rely on
diet, exercise, and lifestyle modification rather than medi-
cations. Otherwise, the financial burden imposed by obe-
sity may be matched by the costs of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates that a metabolic syndrome phe-
notype may exist in perhaps 4% of the US adolescent popu-
lation and almost 30% of overweight adolescents. Of those
adolescents with metabolic syndrome, the great majority
were overweight. This syndrome may affect almost 1 mil-
lionadolescentsintheUnitedStates.Theimpactofthemeta-
bolicsyndromeinadolescentsonsubsequentmorbidityand
mortality has not, however, been explored, nor has the po-
tential to reduce these risks by weight loss, increased ac-
tivity, or pharmacological alteration of associated meta-
bolic derangements. Nonetheless, these data indicate that
a substantial percentage of US adolescents may be at sig-
nificantly heightened risk for the metabolic syndrome in
adulthood and the subsequent risks for type 2 diabetes
andprematurecoronaryarterydisease.Perhapstheyshould
be considered candidates for aggressive therapeutic inter-
ventions to maintain healthy lifestyle into and through-
out adulthood.

What This Study Adds
Childhood overweight currently affects 15% of chil-
dren, and more than 60% of adults are overweight. Re-
cently, the metabolic syndrome has been shown to affect
more than 20% of the age-adjusted adult population and
is closely related to the obesity epidemic. It is a cluster-
ing of metabolic derangements that reflect or portend in-
sulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and premature cardio-
vascular disease. To date, there has been no estimate of
the potential disease burden for children or adoles-
cents.
This study suggests that the phenotype of the meta-
bolic syndrome may affect 4% of adolescents in the United
States, with nearly 80% of adolescents who meet the cri-
teria employed for the metabolic syndrome being over-
weight. Almost 30% of the overweight youth in this
sample have 3 or more of the risk factors for the meta-
bolic syndrome, thus qualifying under the criteria em-
ployed. Because metabolic syndrome significantly in-
creases the risk of type 2 diabetes and premature coronary
artery disease in adults, adolescent subjects who con-
tinue to manifest this risk factor profile may constitute
a subgroup of overweight teenagers to target for life-
style behavior changes.
