Introduction
Psychosocial development and healthy self-esteem are influ-
enced by self-perceptions of competence originating from per-
sonal, social, and environmental experiences. Self-esteem is
now generally conceived as a multi-dimensional construct
encompassing a range of domain-specific self-perceptions
(Bracken, 1992; Harter, 1999; Marsh, 1988; Marsh, Craven, &
Debus, 1991; Marsh, Craven, & Martin, 2006). Within this
multi-faceted framework, Harter (1999) proposed a number of
self-esteem domains related to perceptions of academic, social,
and physical competence, as well as global self-worth, which
represents an individual's overall perception of his or her value
as a person. Harter (2012) asserts that actual competence in a
particular domain is a major contributor to self-perceptions,
with strong implications for motivation of future behavior.
Little is understood of the impact of level of motor com-
petence on self-perceptions in adolescence, and in particular
how this may differentially affect girls and boys. Although
research has demonstrated adverse psychosocial conse-
quences of low motor competence in children, it is often
overlooked that in the transition through adolescence into
adulthood, lowered self-perceptions across a range of
domains associated with low motor competence may persist.
Although not diminishing childhood as an important stage in
psychosocial development, Kirby (2004) highlighted low
self-perceptions in early adolescence as being particularly
pertinent to those who have low motor competence. With the
transition into secondary school, early adolescence is a
period of biological (Malina, 1990), social, and cognitive
change (Montmeyer & Flannery, 1990), where relationships
undergo dramatic transformations. As a result of these
changes, self-perceptions become particularly malleable
(Brinthaupt & Lipka, 2012; Finkenauer, Rutger, Engels, &
Oosterwegel, 2002; Harter, 2012). Accompanying these psy-
cho-biological changes, the early adolescent's perception of
gender role intensifies, which, according to Harter (1993),
occurs differently for boys and girls.
Although it is logical to assume that actual level of motor
competence affects perceptions of physical competence,
studies with children have shown that low motor competence
also affects other domains resulting in lowered social

Does Motor Competence Affect
Self-Perceptions Differently for
Adolescent Males and Females?

Abstract
Little is understood about the impact of level of motor competence on self-perceptions in adolescence, in particular how
this may differentially affect girls and boys. A sample of 1,568 14-year-old participants (766 girls and 802 boys) were grouped
into four motor competence levels (very low to high) based on the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development
(MAND). Self-perceptions were assessed using the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. Boys had higher self-perceptions
of global self-worth, athletic competence, and physical appearance, whereas girls had higher scores for close friendships
and behavioral conduct. Main effects in the predicted direction were found for motor competence for self-perceptions of
global self-worth, athletic competence, physical appearance, close friendships, social acceptance, and romantic appeal. These
findings indicate that level of motor competence is important in many aspects of self-perceptions, affecting girls and boys
differently. Higher motor competence has a protective effect on psychosocial health, particularly for girls.

competence, academic and behavioral problems, and overall
low self-esteem (Geuze & Borger, 1993; Gillberg & Gillberg,
1989; Losse et al., 1991; Rose, 1994). Whether the impact of
low motor competence is similar on self-perceptions during
early adolescence is relatively less clear. For example,
Cantell, Smyth, and Ahonen (1994) found that the impact of
motor competence was limited to physical and academic
self-perception domains. Others, however, report that the
negative impact of low motor competence extended to the
social self-perception and global self-worth domains (Losse
et al., 1991; Piek, Dworcan, Barrett, & Coleman, 2000).
Overall, the problems for adolescents with low competence
appear poorly acknowledged or overlooked.
Another issue that has received scant attention in the self-
perception and motor competence literature is that of gender
differences, which are rarely considered when comparing
levels of motor competence. Given that girls generally have
lower self-perceptions than boys and that this difference
extends across the life span (Harter, 1999; Kling, Hyde,
Showers, & Buswell, 1999; Labbrozzi, Robazza, Bertollo,
Bucci, & Bortoli, 2013; Wigfield, Eccles, Iver, Reumann, &
Midgley, 1991), it is probable that the relationship between
motor competence and self-perceptions may be influenced in
adolescence by gender. Rose (1994) conducted one of the
few studies that examined gender differences as well as
motor competence levels and self-perceptions in 8- to
11-year-old children. She found that gender differences
existed across a wide range of self-perceptions and motiva-
tional orientation toward physical activity. Those who were
female and poorly coordinated had the lowest scores.
Furthermore, this may compound with age. Labrozzi et al.
(2013) found that, compared with younger girls, 13-year-
olds had a poorer physical perception, lower intrinsic moti-
vation, and enjoyment of physical activity. It is not known
whether the coupling of being female and having low motor
competence creates a further disadvantage for girls' self-per-
ceptions in early adolescence.
In this study, we aimed to examine self-perceptions of
14-year-old boys and girls who differed in level of motor
competence from very low to very high. We hypothesized
that actual level of motor competence would not only affect
the self-perceptions of athletic competence but also extend to
all domains. Furthermore, we predicted that the self-percep-
tions of adolescents with low levels of motor competence
would be lower than their better coordinated peers.
Method
Participants
Participants were drawn from the longitudinal Western
Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study (http://www.
rainestudy.org.au). Between 1989 and 1992, 2,900 pregnant
women were recruited into the study. The initial study meth-
ods have been reported elsewhere (Newnham, Evans,
Michael, Stanley, & Landau, 1993). Data were collected
from the cohort in follow-up surveys at 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 14,
17, 20, and 23 years of age. This article reports data for 1,568
of the cohort at 14 years of age (766 girls and 802 boys) who
completed both the motor competence and self-perception
components of the survey. Raine study families are broadly
representative of the general Western Australian population:
10.7% of parents never married (vs. 9.8%), a lower propor-
tion of fathers employed in managerial positions and a higher
proportion employed in professional positions, 7.5% chil-
dren were born <37weeks (vs. 6.5%), and slightly more chil-
dren were born <2,500g (vs. 6.5%) (Li et al., 2008).
Measures
Motor competence was measured using the McCarron
Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND;
McCarron, 1997) that comprises five fine motor tasks (plac-
ing beads in box, placing beads on rod, sliding a rod along a
bar, screwing a bolt through a nut, and finger tapping) and
five gross motor tasks (heel toe walking, grip strength, stand-
ing broad jump, one foot balance and touching from finger,
to nose, to finger). The overall measure of motor compe-
tence, the Neuromuscular Developmental Index (NDI), was
derived from participants' performance on the 10 motor
tasks, by scaling each task according to chronological age
and gender (M = 100, SD = 15). The participants were
grouped into one of four motor competence groups based on
the NDI score: very low (NDI < 71, n = 67), low (NDI <
71-85, n = 354), average (NDI > 86-114, n = 895), and high
(NDI > 115, n = 252; see Table 1). Test­retest reliability
coefficients of the MAND tasks are reported by McCarron
(1997) at 0.99 overall, and researchers have found the
MAND to be a reliable indicator of motor coordination in
Australian children (Hoare & Larkin, 1990). Validity of the
MAND as a measure of motor competence was also estab-
lished when the test was directly compared with two other
commonly used motor coordination tests, Bruininks
Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency and Movement
Assessment Battery for Children (Tan, Parker, & Larkin,
2001).
Self-perceptions were assessed using Harter's (1988)
Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. This is a 45-item
questionnaire comprising a four-level, structured, alternate-
response format to measure perceptions of nine domains:
Athletic Competence, Physical Appearance, Social
Acceptance, Close Friendship, Romantic Appeal, Behavioral
Conduct, Job Competence, Scholastic Competence, and
Global Self-Worth. Each domain score is derived from the
average of five statements distributed within the question-
naire. The participant first decides which statement is "most
true for her/him," for example, "Some teenagers have a lot of
friends BUT other teenagers don't have very many friends."
They then decide whether the statement is "really true" or
"sort of true." The score for each statement ranges from 1
Rose et al. 3
(lowest) to 4 (highest) with some items being negatively
coded to ensure greater validity of responses. Validity and
reliability of the questionnaire with Australian adolescents
have been reported (Rose, Hands, & Larkin, 2012).
Parents or guardians provided written informed consent.
The Human Research Ethics Committee at Princess Margaret
Hospital provided approval to carry out the research.
Participants completed the questionnaire before participating
in the MAND test, and all testing was carried out by trained
research assistants.
Data Analysis
Two-way (Motor Competence [4] × Gender [2]) ANOVAs
were applied to each of the self-perception domains. Where
significant main effects, but no significant interactions, were
revealed in that analysis, follow-up one-way ANOVAs were
conducted for each gender separately across the range of
competence. These secondary analyses were to identify
whether the pattern in self-perception domain scores across
motor competence levels was the same for males and
females. To reduce the chance of Type 1 error, given the
same data set was used for multiple statistical analyses, the
statistical significance was set at a more conservative p < .01
for all analyses.
Results
In overview, the Motor Competence (4) × Gender (2)
ANOVAs revealed significant main effects for both motor
competence and gender in four domains: Athletic
Competence, Physical Appearance, Close Friendships, and
Global Self-Worth. Motor competence was the only main
effect for Social Acceptance, Scholastic Competence, and
Romantic Appeal, and gender, the only main effect for
Behavioral Conduct. In general, across all self-perception
domains, the mean ratings were lowest for the very low or
low (Physical Appearance) motor competence groups and
highest for the average (Behavioral Conduct) or high motor
competence groups (Table 2). Boys had higher self-percep-
tions of global self-worth, athletic competence, and physical
appearance, whereas girls had higher scores for Close
Friendships and Behavioral Conduct. There were no signifi-
cant interactions (Table 3).
Following is a more detailed description of the post hoc
analyses for the group differences. Only those group differ-
ences where p < .01 is reported. Tukey post hoc comparisons
showed that all groups were significantly different in self-per-
ceptions from each other for Athletic Competence (p < .006 to
p < .001) and Social Acceptance (p < .007 to p < .001). For
Global Self-Worth and Physical Appearance, the low, but not
the very low, competence groups were significantly lower than
the average (p < .003 and p < .006, for each domain respec-
tively) and the high competence groups (p < .000 for both
domains). For Scholastic Competence and Close Friendships,
the very low (p < .001 for both domains) and low (p < .001 and
p < .01, respectively) groups were significantly lower than the
high competence group. For Scholastic Competence, the very
low and low groups were also significantly lower than the
average group (p < .001 for both contrasts). Finally, for
Romantic Appeal, the low competent group was significantly
lower than the high competent group (p < .009).
Motor Competence Differences Within Gender
For the four domains for which both motor competence and
gender were main effects, the secondary analysis of self-per-
ceptions was often different for each gender (see Figure 1).
For Athletic Competence, the profile of self-perceptions was
the same for males compared with females, with higher per-
ceptions at each successive motor competence level. For
Physical Appearance, this analysis showed an increase in
self-perception between the low and high motor competence
groups for girls only. In the Close Friendships domain,
although females were significantly higher than males over-
all (p < .001), those in the very low motor competence group
had lower self-perceptions than those in the high group (p <
.007) compared with males who showed no significant
change in Close Friendships across motor competence lev-
els. Although males rate their Global Self-Worth as signifi-
cantly higher than females overall (p < .002), there were no
competence group differences for either males or females
(see Figure 1).
Discussion
We found that motor competence had a pervasive influence
on self-perceptions of young, 14-year-old adolescents that
extended beyond the physical to social and scholastic
domains, as well as to global self-esteem. Similar findings
have been reported not only for children (Rose, Larkin, &
Berger, 1997; Schoemaker & Kalverboer, 1994) but also for
adolescents (Skinner & Piek, 2001).

Within the physical domain, our results showed that
self-perceptions of Athletic Competence and Physical
Appearance of those with higher motor competence were
higher whereas those with lower motor competence were
lower, and that girls' self-perceptions were consistently
lower at any competence level. Given that Athletic
Competence is the perception of ability to perform skills in
sports and games (Harter, 1999), such a self-perception
profile is predictable and consistent with other studies
(Cantell et al., 1994, 2003) and conceptual models linking
actual and perceived motor competence (L. M. Barnett,
Morgan, Van Beurden, Ball, & Lubans, 2011; Stodden
et al., 2008). This also concurred with Harter's (2012) con-
clusion that actual competence in a domain is a major con-
tributor to the associated self-perception. Also, as ability in
sport is highly valued in Australian society, low motor com-
petence is difficult to hide, and we suggest that those with
low motor competence avoid social comparison wherever
possible by withdrawing from physical activities. Skinner
and Piek (2001) reported those with low motor competence
had higher anxiety and perceived themselves as less com-
petent with poorer social support. One might speculate that
low self-perceptions of physical competence may be a sig-
nificant contributor to the commonly reported sports drop-
out during adolescence (Australian Bureau of Statistics,
2009, 2012)
The higher perceptions of athletic competence among
boys is not surprising given that as girls enter adolescence,
they often demonstrate lower intrinsic motivation and enjoy-
ment of physical activity than those younger in age (Labrozzi
et al., 2013). However, it was noteworthy that the self-
perception scores of Athletic Competence by girls in the two
higher motor competence groups exceeded scores of boys in
the two lower groups. The boys' higher perceptions of
Physical Appearance may be explained by Paquette and
Underwood's (1999) findings that girls had lower percep-
tions of attractiveness and greater fear of being talked about
than boys, although one might also contend that motor
competence has an important role in personal grooming, pos-
ture, and moving confidently.
We found that motor competence and gender affected
self-perceptions in other domains besides those aligned with
the physical domains. Self-perceptions of Close Friendships
were positively affected by motor competence for both boys
and girls, but in this case, girls in all groups had consistently
higher self-perceptions than boys. In fact, the mean self-per-
ception scores of girls as a group for Close Friendships were
the highest of any domain. As this domain tapped the ability
to make close friends and to share personal thoughts, and
given that girls are more likely than boys to seek out one best
friend (Harter, 1999), this result could be expected.
A number of self-perception domains were influenced
solely by motor competence. Scholastic Competence self-
perception was higher for those with higher motor compe-
tence. Many other studies (Cantell et al., 1994; Losse et al.,
1991; Rigoli, Piek, Kane, & Oosterlaan, 2012; Skinner &
Piek, 2001) also reported that being a competent mover
appears to be a distinct advantage in the classroom, particu-
larly in childhood, and was associated with positive self-per-
ceptions of academic ability. Our results demonstrate this
continues into early adolescence. Although one might think
that those with poor motor competence might naturally shun
physical activity and focus on academics, our results suggest
that if such a focus has occurred, then actual motor compe-
tence is still a persistent influence on perceptions of scholas-
tic ability.
Developing positive relationships with the opposite sex
both in and out of school is increasingly important during
adolescence. We found that perceptions of SocialAcceptance
and Romantic Appeal were both influenced by motor compe-
tence only, not gender. There are social occasions such as
school dances and recreational activities that require moving
with confidence and skill, and one could surmise that those
with low motor competence would feel more inhibited, less
confident, and less socially adept to engage with their peers.
Cantell et al. (1994) had earlier reported that although ado-
lescents with poor motor competence did not express dissat-
isfaction with their romantic appeal, they were nevertheless
less sociable and chose solitary leisure time activities. Such
choices could likely inhibit the development of positive per-
ceptions of one's social relationships.
The one domain affected solely by gender was Behavioral
Conduct, one that relates to behaving in the correct manner.
Regardless of motor competence, girls as a group had sig-
nificantly higher self-perception scores than the boys as a
group. In early adolescence, many other societal influences
that define gender role and societal expectations of girls as
compared with boys would contribute to girls scoring this
domain higher than boys.
The final domain to consider is that of Global Self-Worth.
This domain taps the degree that one likes and values oneself
as a person and the way one is leading his or her life and feels
good about himself or herself, and, according to Harter

(1999), arises from both the relative contributions of the
domain-specific self-perceptions and the importance of each
in the individual's life. Importantly, Harter (1999) contends
that Global Self-Worth is also the most difficult perception to
alter. Accordingly, this domain provides an important,
wholistic picture of a relatively stable self-perception. Our
results showed that perception of Global Self-Worth was not
only significantly higher for boys--similar to previous
research by Harter (1988), Kling et al. (1999), and Marsh
(1988)--but that the profile of perceptions for boys and girls
across motor competence groups was the same. As motor
competence increased, the self-perception scores increased
also. This was similar to Skinner and Piek's (2001) study that
showed low motor competent children and adolescents had
lower self-worth than those with normal motor coordination.
Again, motor competence appeared to be an enhancer of
self-perceptions in this domain.
Besides Global Self-Worth, we found that three quarters
of the other domain-specific perceptions were positively
influenced by motor competence, the exceptions being
Behavioral Conduct and Job Competence. Motor compe-
tence, however, is a personal factor that is not fixed, unlike
gender, and is a factor that can be changed and improved. In
light of possible improvements in domain-specific
self-perceptions with improved motor competence and that
Global Self-Worth arises from the relative contributions of
these domain-specific perceptions, we argue that self-worth
may not be as resistant to change as Harter (1999) asserts.
Our findings lead us to assert that motor competence is a
pervasive factor likely to strengthen perceptions of self-
worth in young adolescents. This hypothesis could be tested
in future intervention studies in which motor skills of those
with low motor competence are improved and self-percep-
tions monitored.
In summary, having low motor competence and being a
girl were double hindrances in young adolescents forming
high perceptions of their physical self. However, being a girl
was an advantage for higher perceptions in the friendship
and conduct domains. Therefore, it appears that actual motor
competence has a pervasive, supportive effect that strength-
ens self-perceptions in adolescent girls, not only of their
physical self but also in global self-esteem.
Strengths and Limitations
The current study has several strengths. First, motor compe-
tence was measured using the NDI, an objective, standard-
ized, and normalized score (M = 100, SD = 15), which

enabled the large number of participants to be categorized
into four levels of competence. This larger range enabled a
greater ability to discriminate self-perception characteristics
among a wider range of motor competence. Many of the con-
clusions have been drawn from other studies with either
dichotomized (low compared with competent; Piek, Baynam,
& Barrett, 2006) or three groupings (significant motor prob-
lems, minor deficiency, and normal competence; Cantell
et al., 2003).
Furthermore, it is rare in the motor competence literature
to have a large participant sample that is representative of the
population and covering both genders across the full range of
motor competence. Studies that recruit clinically based sam-
ples typically underrepresent females in comparison with
male participants, and consequently, gender comparisons are
not common in the literature.
However, there are several limitations in this study that
may affect the generalizability of findings. First, although a
very large sample was measured, these data were derived
from a single year snapshot within a longitudinal study
design. Although it seems unlikely that self-perceptions are
the genesis of poor motor coordination, reverse causal rela-
tionships are less clear. Of the many studies that have exam-
ined motor coordination problems in children, only a handful
are longitudinal (for example, Cantell et al., 1994). More lon-
gitudinal tracking of the psychosocial development of chil-
dren across a full range of motor coordination is needed to
clarify causality. Future studies should also consider the intri-
cate and potentially circular relationship between gross motor
impairment and perceived competence across a range of psy-
chosocial domains, with the explicit aim of delineating cause
and effect (Emck, Bosscher, Beek, & Doreleijers, 2009).
Second, the chosen measures may not be sufficiently sen-
sitive to fully explain the relationship between the two vari-
ables of interest. Although Harter's Scale has demonstrated
reliability and validity, the forced choice scale based on "sort
of true for me" or "really true for me" gives only a score range
from 1 to 4 and does not allow for a neutral or "not applicable
at all" response. Potentially, real psychosocial­behavioral dif-
ferences might be masked by the narrow range of values
derived from the scale. Alternately, statistical significance in
scores might not relate to real significance in psychosocial
behaviors. Furthermore, we do not know the relative impor-
tance of these domains in the lives of young adolescents nor
do we know to what extent the importance placed on a domain
is affected by level of motor competence. If one was aiming
to improve psychosocial health of young people with poor
motor competence, then understanding which areas of self-
perception are more important to them could result in more
targeted interventions and more meaningful outcomes.
Unfortunately, although Harter's (1988) Scale enables such a
measure to be collected, this aspect was not included in the
questionnaires used in the longitudinal Raine study. We rec-
ommend that investigations into self-perceptions in the future
measure not only the strength of perceptions but also the
importance of the domains to participants.
Finally, although the MAND is used widely as a measure
of motor competence, it may not fully capture some aspects
of motor competence as it does not include any object con-
trol skills. This omission may be important in seeking to bet-
ter understand the different associations we identified
between motor competence and gender. A number of studies
have identified gender differences in the performance of
many ball skills (for example, L. M. Barnett, van Buerden,
Morgan, Brooks, & Beard, 2010; Thomas & French, 1985).
Summary and Conclusion
Developing healthy self-esteem is affected by many per-
sonal, social, and environmental factors, and in the transition
from childhood into adolescence, the influence of motor
competence on self-perceptions, in concert with gender
effects, is not well-understood. Our results clearly indicate
that motor competence in early adolescence is an important
factor in psychosocial health and that its effect differs
between males and females in a number of self-perception
domains, including Global Self-Worth. Together, motor
competence and gender in early adolescence were significant
effects in about half the self-perception domains measured
by Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents Scale
and, alone, motor competence had a significant influence in
the majority of these domains.
In conclusion, although we have investigated the mutual
effects of only two possible influences on self-esteem, our
findings have important implications for building psychoso-
cial health in adolescents. First, motor competence is a per-
vasive influence in young adolescents' self-perceptions
across a number of physical, social, and academic domains;
second, actual motor competence enhances self-perceptions;
and third, the lower self-perceptions typical of girls are
boosted by higher motor competence. This more nuanced
picture may assist practitioners and educators to provide
more appropriate interventions for girls and boys at all levels
of motor competence. We conclude that to build healthy self-
esteem, particularly for young adolescent females, one key
way could be to facilitate their participation in sports and
recreation, teach motor skills, and present opportunities to
improve their actual motor competence.
