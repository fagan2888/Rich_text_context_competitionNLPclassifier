Abstract: Previous research has investigated the manner in which absolute height impacts
on jealousy and mate retention. Although relative height is also important, little information
exists about the potential influence of sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS) within
established relationships. The current study investigated the relationship between SDS and
the satisfaction, jealousy and mate retention behaviors reported by men and women.
Heterosexual men (n = 98) and women (n = 102) completed a questionnaire. Men in high
SDS relationships reported the lowest levels of cognitive and behavioral jealousy, although
the impact of SDS on relationship satisfaction was less clear. SDS was not associated with
the overall use of mate retention strategies; SDS did however affect the use of three
specific strategies (vigilance, monopolization of time, love and care). SDS did not affect
women's relationship satisfaction, jealousy (cognitive, behavioral, or emotional) or the use
of mate retention strategies (with the exception of resource display).

Introduction
Previous research has investigated the manner in which absolute height impacts on
jealousy and mate retention. Although relative height is also important, little research has
been conducted to explore the association between sexual dimorphism and these aspects of
romantic relationships. We examine whether sexual dimorphism is associated with
satisfaction, jealousy and mate retention behavior within established relationships.
Height, Mate Quality and Sexual Relationships
Male stature provides important information about the quality of a potential mate.
For example, height provides an indication of both physical health and standard of living
(Komlos and Baten, 1998; Persico, Postlewaite, and Silverman, 2004) and is related to
established measures of genetic quality such as fluctuating asymmetry (Manning, 1995).
SDS, jealousy, and mate retention
Furthermore, male stature is related to socioeconomic status and access to resources (Judge
and Cable, 2004; Peck and Lundberg, 1995; Silventoinen, Lahelma, and Rahkonen, 1999),
and tall men are perceived as more dominant and assertive than shorter men (Melamed,
1992). These findings indicate that height may signal the possession of both physical and
non-physical qualities.
Compared to the amount of male oriented height research, minimal research has
been conducted to explore the potential role of female height. Silventoinen et al. (1999)
however report that both tall and short women are susceptible to illness when compared to
those of medium height. For example, incidence of breast cancer has been related to female
height (Brinton and Swanson, 1992; Palmer et al., 1995). These findings suggest that
medium height women are advantaged compared to their tall or short rivals.
The association between height and the possession of valued characteristics has
contributed to the relationship between height and desirability as a mate. In particular,
height is associated with attractiveness (Courtiol, Raymond, Godelle, and Ferdy, 2010), the
ability to attract a mate (Lynne and Shurgot, 1984), dating frequency (Shepperd and
Strathman, 1989) and the attractiveness of the partner obtained (Feingold, 1982). Height
may also impact on overall reproductive success, as tall men are less likely to be childless
(Nettle, 2002) and report a greater number of children (Mueller and Mazur, 2001) than
shorter men.
Jealousy and Mate Retention
The association between height, attractiveness and reproductive success suggests
that height may also impact on emotions and behavior within established relationships. For
both men and women in long term relationships, extra-pair relationships and desertion
represent substantial threats to reproductive success. In this context, jealousy may serve a
number of adaptive functions (Buss, 2000; Buunk, Massar, and Dijkstra, 2007). The
elicitation of jealousy may identify individuals or situations that threaten the existence or
exclusivity of the existing relationship. The identification of a threatening individual or
situation may promote the use of mate retention behaviors intended to strengthen the pair
bond or deter rivals (Buunk et al., 2007). This response (if elicited by an appropriate threat)
may promote reproductive success by reducing the likelihood of extra-pair relationships or
termination of the primary partnership. Jealousy may also promote positive aspects of the
romantic relationship (Dugosh, 2000) if the jealousy is interpreted as a sign of commitment
to the relationship or strength of feelings towards the partner. In addition, individuals that
believe their partner is admired by a potential rival may raise their assessment of the
partner's mate quality, increasing subsequent attraction or attentiveness.
Previous research has documented the manner in which height is related to jealousy
and mate retention. Buunk, Park, Zurriaga, Klavina and Massar (2008) report that tall men
are less jealous than short men when confronted with physically attractive or (physically or
socially) dominant rivals. In addition, Brewer and Riley (2009) found that tall men report
lower levels of cognitive or behavioral jealousy than short men. Whilst the researchers
found no association between height and the overall use of mate retention strategies,
relationships were found with a number of specific mate retention behaviors. Tall and short
men were shown to engage in different mate retention behaviors. Specifically, tall men

SDS, jealousy, and mate retention
were less likely to use appearance enhancement or love and care to retain a partner, but
were more likely to employ vigilance, monopolization of time and jealousy induction. The
tendency to use these mate retention tactics may indicate tall men's ability to adopt
undesirable behavior without lowering their desirability as a mate. In contrast, shorter men
are reluctant to reduce their own attractiveness and use tactics which enhance the
desirability of the current relationship. The relationship between female height and jealousy
is less established. Buunk et al. (2007) demonstrate that female height is curvilinearly
related to jealousy, with women of average height reporting the lowest levels of jealousy
and partner's sexual interest in others. The researchers also found that women of average
height were less jealous of physically attractive rivals but reported increased jealousy of
"masculine" rivals that were physically dominant with a high social status. The greater
jealousy of tall and short women when compared to women of medium height was
supported by Buunk, Pollet, Klavina, Figueredo and Dijkstra (2009).
Sexual Dimorphism in Stature (SDS)
The relative height of an individual, in relation to a partner, operationalized as
sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS: male height / female height) is also important. Both
men and women adjust their preference for partner height in relation to their own stature
(Fink, Neave, Brewer, and Pawlowski, 2007; Pawlowski, 2003). The importance placed on
relative, in addition to absolute height allows individuals to select a mate whose appearance
is consistent with the male taller norm and maintain a relatively large pool of potential
mates, whilst avoiding individuals at each extreme (i.e., extremely tall or short).
Furthermore, the extent to which high or low SDS relationships are preferred is not static.
Research has identified a number of factors such as menstrual cycle stage and sexual
strategy (Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005) that influence women's preferred SDS.
Previous findings highlight the potential importance of SDS and suggest that
additional research exploring this variable would be beneficial. Those able to secure a
partner with the optimum SDS (i.e., observing the male taller norm whilst avoiding extreme
differences in height) may be more satisfied with their partner and subsequent relationship.
The level of SDS within a relationship may also influence a partner's jealousy and use of
mate retention tactics. For example, men in low SDS relationships may feel threatened by
the number of rivals that may be attractive to their partner.
The Current Study
The manner in which absolute height impacts on behavior within a relationship has
been investigated. A number of factors influencing the degree of SDS preferred in a
relationship have also been identified (Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005). However, little
information exists about the potential influence of SDS on emotions and behavior within
established relationships. The current study investigated the relationship between SDS and
the relationship satisfaction, jealousy and mate retention behaviors reported by men and
women.

Materials and Methods
Participants
Heterosexual men (n = 98) aged between 19 and 72 (M = 27.28, SD = 11.09) and
women (n = 102) aged between 18 and 68 (M = 31.41, SD = 13.05) participated in the
current study. Individuals were recruited from the local community through opportunity
sampling. All participants were in a romantic relationship at the time of the study. Men's
height ranged from 155cm to 196cm (M = 178.42, SD = 8.14) and men's SDS ranged from
.79 to 1.25 (M = 1.08, SD = .08). Women's height ranged from 145cm to 201cm (M =
163.62, SD = 8.09) and women's SDS ranged from .97 to 1.23 (M = 1.09, SD = .06).
Procedure
Participants were presented with a questionnaire which asked a range of
autobiographical questions (age, own height and partner's height). Participants were then
asked to rate their relationship satisfaction on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 = very
dissatisfied to 7 = very satisfied). Participants were also asked to complete the 24 item
Multidimensional Jealousy Scale (Pfeiffer and Wong, 1989), assessing cognitive (8 items),
emotional (8 items) and behavioral (8 items) jealousy. Cognitive jealousy constitutes the
individual's appraisal of a situation, emotional jealousy concerns how a person responds to
potentially provoking situations, and behavioral jealousy includes a range of behaviors
intended to reduce a specific threat. Each subscale proved to be reliable (Cronbach's alpha:
cognitive: male, .92, female, .88; emotional: male, .86, female, .89; behavioral: male, .90,
female, .92). All items relating to jealousy were completed on a 7-point Likert scale.
Finally, participants completed the Mate Retention Inventory-Short Form (Buss,
Shackelford, and McKibbin, 2008), consisting of 38 items, rated on a 3-point Likert scale.
The scale proved to be reliable (Cronbach's alpha: male, .88, female, .87). The scale
captured 19 different tactics (2 items per tactic). As shown in Table 1, each subscale of the
questionnaire was also largely reliable.

Results
Consistent with previous research, the data generated by both male and female
participants demonstrate a male taller norm. There was a correlation between participant
height and the height of their current partner. Controlling for age, these correlations were
r = .27, p < .05, and r = .38, p < .001 for male and female participants respectively.
Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) were conducted to investigate SDS category
differences in relationship behavior. The analyses were conducted separately for male and
female participants. SDS categories were established on the basis of available data.
Consequently, SDS was divided into six categories for male participants and only three
categories for female participants. The effects of age and absolute height were controlled
for during all analyses. For all findings the more robust Pillai's Trace is reported due to the
relatively small sample size and unequal N values.
Male Emotions and Relationship Behavior
A one-way between groups MANOVA was performed to investigate SDS category
differences in male emotions and relationship behavior. Five dependent variables were
selected: cognitive jealousy, emotional jealousy, behavioral jealousy, overall mate retention

behaviors and relationship satisfaction. There was a statistically significant difference of
SDS categories on the combined dependent variables, F(25,375) = 2.03, p < .005; Pillai's
Trace = .60, partial eta squared = .12.
When the results for the dependent variables were considered separately, the three
SDS category differences to reach statistical significance were cognitive jealousy, F(5,75)
= 2.47, p < .05, behavioral jealousy, F(5,75) = 2.76, p < .05, and relationship satisfaction,
F(5,7) = 5.59, p < .005. As shown in Table 2, men in high SDS relationships reported the
least cognitive and behavioral jealousy. Whilst significant, the pattern of relationship
satisfaction showed little consistency across SDS categories.

A second one-way between groups MANOVA was conducted to examine SDS
category differences in male mate retention. Nineteen dependent variables (vigilance,
concealment of mate, monopolization of time, jealousy induction, punish mate's infidelity
threat, emotional manipulation, commitment manipulation, derogation of competitors,
resource display, sexual inducements, appearance enhancement, love and care, submission
and debasement, verbal possession signals, physical possession signals, possessive
ornamentation, derogation of mate, intra-sexual threats, and violence against rivals) were
employed.
There was a statistically significant difference of SDS categories on the combined
dependent variables, F(95,340) = 1.30, p < .05; Pillai's Trace = .1.33, partial eta squared =
.27. When the results for the dependent variables were considered separately, the three SDS
category differences to reach statistical significance were vigilance, F(5,82) = 2.97, p <
.001, monopolization of time, F(5,82) = 2.67, p < .005, and love and care, F(5,82) = 2.33,
p < .005. As shown in Table 3, men in high SDS relationships were more likely to use
vigilance and monopolization of time to retain a partner than men in low SDS category
relationships. Love and care was most frequently used by men in either high or low SDS
relationships.

Female Emotions and Relationship Behavior
A one-way between groups MANOVA was conducted to investigate SDS category
differences in female emotions and relationship behavior. Five dependent variables were
selected: cognitive jealousy, emotional jealousy, behavioral jealousy, overall mate retention
behaviors, and relationship satisfaction. There was no statistically significant difference of
SDS categories on the combined dependent variables, F(10,142) = .85, p > .05; Pillai's
Trace = .11, partial eta squared = .06. No dependent variables reached statistical
significance separately.

Discussion
Overall, the results indicate that SDS affects male but not female emotions and
relationship behavior. Men in high SDS relationships reported the lowest levels of
cognitive and behavioral jealousy, although the impact of SDS on relationship satisfaction
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(4). 2010. -538-
SDS, jealousy, and mate retention
was less clear. SDS was not associated with the overall use of mate retention strategies;
SDS did however affect the use of three specific strategies (vigilance, monopolization of
time, love and care). Men in high SDS relationships were more likely to use vigilance and
monopolization of time than other men. Love and care was used most frequently by men in
both high and low SDS relationships.
These findings extend previous research (Brewer and Riley, 2009) detailing the
relationship between male height, jealousy and the use of mate retention behaviors.
Adjusting the preference for partner height in relation to their own stature (Pawlowski,
2003) allows men and women to select a mate whose appearance is consistent with the
male taller norm and avoid individuals at each height extreme whilst maintaining a
relatively large pool of potential mates. Consequently, men in high SDS relationships may
encounter relatively few rivals that display a desirable SDS without extreme height, thus
reducing the risk of cuckoldry or abandonment. The relative number of potential rivals may
account for the lower levels of cognitive and behavioral jealousy reported by men in high
SDS relationships. The use of vigilance and monopolization of time by men in high SDS
relationships may reflect their greater size and strength in comparison to female partners.
Both tactics may be more effective when used by a physically intimidating partner. In
addition, men in high SDS relationships may adopt undesirable retention behaviors,
believing that they are at less risk of retaliation from the partner or a rival male.
SDS did not affect women's relationship satisfaction, jealousy (cognitive,
behavioral or emotional) or the use of mate retention strategies (with the exception of
resource display, which was most frequently used by women in high SDS relationships).
These results appear inconsistent with the aforementioned relationship between SDS and
male behavior. The dissociation between SDS and women's relationship behaviors was
unexpected. These findings may however reflect the use of only three SDS categories for
female participants, compared to the more diverse male sample that was divided into six
SDS categories. Additional data collection (specifically targeting women in low and high
SDS relationships) would be beneficial.
We tentatively offer an alternate explanation of this finding, focusing on the
reproductive consequences of a successful high or low SDS reproductive relationship most
acutely impacting on women. Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) may lead to uterine
rupture, operative delivery, maternal and fetal death (van Roosmalen and Brand, 1992), and
remains a leading cause of obstetric complications in developing countries (Harrison,
Rossiter, and Chong, 1985). Short women are at increased risk of CPD (Aitken and Walls,
1986; Sokal, Sawadogo, and Adjibade, 1991) and the relationship between maternal height
and pregnancy outcome has been observed for all social classes (Thompson, 1959). Height
is approximately 80% hereditary (Macgregor, Cornes, Martin, and Visscher, 2006;
Silventoinen et al., 2003) however, and maternal height has been related to both birth
length and weight (Pickering, 1987; Witter and Luke, 1991), with shorter women
producing smaller infants. Despite the influence of maternal height, paternal height also
influences the height (Alberman, Filakti, Williams, and Evans, 1991; Sichieri, Taddei, and
Everhart, 2000) and weight (Shah et al., 2010) of the child. Specifically, infants fathered by
tall men are taller and heavier than infants fathered by short men.
Therefore, shorter women with taller male partners may have secured a high quality

SDS, jealousy, and mate retention
partner (with respect to physical health and socioeconomic status) but these (high SDS)
relationships may result in a greater risk of mortality or injury to the woman or child. In
contrast, women in low SDS relationships (where the man is perhaps shorter and
subsequently less attractive) may result in a less problematic childbirth. Consequently,
there appears to be a trade-off between the selection of a tall man (whose height may
indicate mate quality, resource acquisition, status etc) and the risks associated with CPD.
Additional research exploring this hypothesis is recommended. In particular, the extent to
which the risks of maternal and child mortality impact on both male and female
reproductive success should be investigated.
Limitations and Future Research
The current study relies on the accuracy of participant responses. The reliability of
self-reported height has been documented (Himes and Roche, 1982) and the use of self-
reported height is consistent with previous research (e.g., Pawlowski, 2003). The
limitations of this approach and the greater accuracy afforded by direct measurements are
however acknowledged. In particular, the widespread Western preference for relationships
in which the man is taller (reported by men and women; Gillis and Avis, 1980) may
encourage participants to artificially inflate differences between their own and their
partner's height. In addition, the association between male height, attractiveness and
socioeconomic status (Judge and Cable, 2004; Pawlowski and Koziel, 2002) may increase
the likelihood that the male height reported is similarly inflated.
The current study investigated the relationship between SDS and behavior in a
Western post-industrial society. This is consistent with previous research addressing the
role of height and SDS (e.g., Fink, et al., 2007). Previous research has found no evidence
for the male taller norm or relationship between male height and reproductive success in a
traditional community (Sear and Marlowe, 2009). The results of this study cannot be
generalized to non-Western cultures therefore and additional cross-cultural research is
required.
The current study investigated the relationship between SDS and jealousy, and
considered three elements of the jealous response in particular. We did not however explore
the relative impact of different jealousy evoking scenarios. Previous research has clearly
documented the manner in which men are more reactive to sexual infidelity and women are
more responsive to emotional infidelity (Edlund, Heider, Scherer, Farc, and Sagarin, 2006;
Thomson, Patel, Platek, and Shackelford, 2007). Future research could investigate whether
attentiveness to specific stimuli is influenced by the SDS within a relationship.
The recruitment of participants in a current relationship was intended to reduce
memory bias and avoid reliance on participants' ability to predict behavior. Despite the
anonymity of the study and the involvement of only one member of the relationship pair,
participants may have been reluctant to disclose dissatisfaction with their current
relationship, or the use of socially undesirable mate retention strategies. Additional
research is required to address this issue. In particular, more detailed assessments of
relationship quality and behavior are recommended. Longitudinal data outlining the manner
in which an individual's behavior may vary when in relationships with different levels of
SDS would be particularly informative. Research of this type could also detail the manner

SDS, jealousy, and mate retention
in which the association between SDS and male behavior develops. Conclusions that may
be drawn about the causal nature of relationships between absolute height and behavior are
not possible when investigating SDS. For example, although SDS may influence a man's
behavior within the relationship, his initial personality and behavior may impact on both his
selection of a partner and his later behavior towards her.
Conclusion
To conclude, the current study finds that men in high SDS relationships reported the
lowest levels of cognitive and behavioral jealousy, although the impact of SDS on
relationship satisfaction was less clear. SDS was not associated with the overall use of mate
retention strategies; SDS did however affect the use of three specific strategies (vigilance,
monopolization of time, love and care). SDS did not affect women's relationship
satisfaction, jealousy (cognitive, behavioral or emotional) or the use of mate retention
strategies (with the exception of resource display). It is tentatively suggested that the
dissociation between SDS and women's behavior within the relationship reflects a trade-off
between the qualities associated with male height and the greater risk of difficulties during
