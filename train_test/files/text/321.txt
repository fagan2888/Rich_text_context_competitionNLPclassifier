Objective: To examine the relationships between circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein and concentrations of retinol,
retinyl esters, vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and selenium.
Design: Cross-sectional study using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988­1994) data.
Setting: United States population.
Subjects: Up to 14 519 US noninstitutionalized civilian men and women aged Z20 y.
Results: C-reactive protein concentration (dichotomized at the sex-specific 85th percentile) was inversely and significantly
associated with concentrations of retinol, retinyl esters, vitamin C, a-carotene, b-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin,
lycopene, and selenium after adjustment for age, sex, race or ethnicity, education, cotinine concentration, body mass index,
leisure-time physical activity, and aspirin use.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the inflammatory process, through the production of reactive oxygen species, may
deplete stores of antioxidants. Whether increased consumption of foods rich in antioxidants or supplementation with antioxidants
can provide health benefits to people characterized by elevated C-reactive protein concentrations may be worthy of further study.

Introduction
Inflammation is now considered to play a prominent role in
the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (Blum & Miller, 1996).
High concentrations of C-reactive protein, a marker of
inflammation, have consistently been linked to an increased
risk for coronary heart disease in many but not all cross-
sectional, case­control, and prospective studies (Danesh et al,
2000). In addition, C-reactive protein concentration was
associated with future adverse events among people
with angina pectoris or myocardial infarction (Liuzzo et al,
1994).
The realization that inflammation may play an important
role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis suggests new
opportunities for the prevention and treatment of athero-
sclerosis. Possible pharmacologic approaches may involve
the use of aspirin and pravastatin (Ridker et al, 1997, 1998).
Less is known about nonpharmacologic approaches to
mitigating the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis.
Several risk factors for coronary heart diseaseFsmoking and
obesity, most notablyFare strongly associated with
C-reactive protein concentration (Das, 1985; Mendall et al,
1996; Tracy et al, 1997; Ford, 1999).
Diet is clearly related to the risk for coronary heart disease
(Krauss et al, 2000). For example, the results of prospective
studies have shown that intake of fat, fruits and vegetables,

grains, and fiber are related to the risk for coronary heart
disease or to risk factors for coronary heart disease such as
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia,
and decreased HDL cholesterol concentration. However,
little is known about how nutritional status is associated
with concentrations of inflammatory markers. A number of
studies, which generally included either small numbers of
participants or were conducted in special populations, have
described inverse relationships between C-reactive protein
concentration and circulating concentrations of antioxi-
dants (Labadarios et al, 1987; Louw et al, 1992; Boosalis et al,
1996; Sattar et al, 1997; Talwar et al, 1997; Root et al, 1999;
Curran et al, 2000; McMillan et al, 2000; Upritchard et al,
2000). In addition, inverse associations were shown between
C-reactive protein concentration and concentrations of
carotenoids and serum retinol using NHANES III data
(Kritchevsky et al, 2000; Stephensen & Gildengorin, 2000;
Erlinger et al, 2001).
Since the associations between C-reactive protein concen-
tration and circulating concentrations of vitamin C, vitamin
E, and selenium have not been well described in population-
based samples, we examined these associations using
NHANES III data. To facilitate comparisons among the
associations of the antioxidants and because previous
NHANES III findings about the associations between serum
carotenoid concentrations and C-reactive protein concentra-
tion were limited to younger participants, we also present
the results of our analyses of circulating concentrations of
serum carotenoids and C-reactive protein for the entire set of
participants. In addition, we explored several possible
sources of effect modification including age, sex, smoking
status, and body mass index.
Subjects and methods
Between 1988 and 1994, the National Center for Health
Statistics conducting the Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III) collected data from a
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US
population by using a multistage, stratified sampling design.
Survey participants were interviewed and invited for a
clinical examination. For most participants, blood was
drawn at the examination clinic, but for some who were
unable to attend the examination because of health reasons,
a blood sample was obtained during the home interview.
People aged Z60 y, and African Americans and Mexican
Americans were oversampled. Details about the survey and
its methods have been previously published (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 1994, 1996).
NHANES III participants attended one of three examina-
tion sessions: morning, afternoon, or evening. Those
attending the morning sessions were asked to fast for 10­
16 h. Those attending the afternoon and evening sessions
were asked to fast for at least 6 h. C­reactive protein was
measured at the University of Washington Department of
Laboratory Medicine by using latex­enhanced nephelome-
try, a low-sensitivity assay (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 1996). Details about the laboratory procedures
and quality control have been previously published (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 1996). The intra- and
interassay coefficients of variation for participants' C-
reactive protein concentrations were 3.2 and 16.1%, respec-
tively (Visser et al, 1999). The lower detection limit was
3.0 mg/l. We defined an elevated C-reactive protein concen-
tration as the 85th percentile of the sex-specific distribution
used in a previous analysis: Z4.4 mg/dl for men and Z7.0 for
women (Ford, 1999).
Concentrations of the following analytes were measured at
the NHANES Central Laboratory at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention: retinol and retinyl esters, vitamin E,
and five carotenoids (alpha- and beta-carotene, B-cryptox-
anthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lycopene) were measured in
serum with an isocratic reverse-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography method, with detection at 325,
300, and 450 nm, respectively (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 1996; Sowell et al, 1994). Serum and red
blood cell folates were measured by radioassay using
Quantaphase I & II assay kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA, USA) (Federation of American Societies for Experimental
Biology, 1995; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
1996). Selenium concentration was measured in serum using
graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 1996). Detailed proce-
dures for these assays were published in the NHANES III
Laboratory Manual (Gunter et al, 1996).
The analyses included the following variables: age, sex,
race or ethnicity, education, serum cotinine concentration,
body mass index, leisure-time physical activity, and aspirin
use. In addition to these, we stratified the analyses by
cigarette smoking and vitamin or mineral supplement use.
Serum cotinine concentration was determined by using
high-performance liquid chromatography atmospheric-pres-
sure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Body
mass index was calculated from measured weight and height
(weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).
We defined four levels of physical activity: vigorously active,
moderately active, lightly active, and sedentary. Vigorously
active was defined as participating three or more times per
week in an activity with a metabolic equivalent (MET) level
of 6 or greater for participants who were 60 y or older and 7
or greater for participants who were younger than 60 y. One
MET is the energy expenditure of approximately 3.5 ml
oxygen/kg body weight/min or 1 kcal/kg body weight/h.
Moderately active was defined as participating five or more
times per week in activities of which no more than two could
be considered vigorous. Lightly active was defined as
participation that was not vigorous or moderate. Sedentary
was defined as engaging in no leisure-time physical activity.
Aspirin use was estimated from the following question: "In
the past month, have you taken any aspirin, Anacin,
Bufferin, Ecotrin, Ascriptin, or Midol?" Participants were

then asked how often they used these products in the past
month. We created three levels of smoking status: partici-
pants who currently smoked (had smoked 100 cigarettes and
were currently smoking), participants who had quit smoking
(had smoked 100 cigarettes and were not currently smoking),
and participants who had never smoked (had never smoked
100 cigarettes).
We limited our analyses to participants who were 20 y or
older. When age-adjusted was performed, the data were
adjusted to the 1980 US population aged Z20 y using the
direct method. To compare categorical and continuous
variables of participants with C-reactive protein concentra-
tions Z85th percentile with those of participants with C-
reactive protein concentrations o85th percentile, we used w2
tests and t-tests, respectively. In addition, the associations
between the dichotomized C-reactive protein concentrations
and the independent variables were examined by using
logistic regression analysis. To account for the complex
survey design, we used SUDAAN and the medical examina-
tion clinic sampling weights to produce our weighted
estimates and standard errors (Shah et al, 1997).
Results
A total of 16 573 participants aged Z20 y attended the
medical examination. Of these, 15 604 had a C-reactive
protein determination (3026 white men, 1898 African-
American men, 2143 Mexican-American men, 267 other
men, 3469 white women, 2315 African-American women,
2132 Mexican-American women, and 354 other women). C-
reactive protein concentrations ranged from o3.0 to
198.0 mg/l for men and o3.0 to 252.0 mg/l for women.
About 77.5% of men and 65.7% of women had a value of
o3.0 mg/l and were assigned a value of o3.0 mg/l.
Participants with an elevated C-reactive protein concen-
tration were older, and after age-adjustment they were less
likely to be white, had fewer years of education, had a higher
serum cotinine concentration, were heavier, were less likely
to be moderately or vigorously active, and were somewhat
less likely to be taking aspirin than participants with a lower
C-reactive protein concentration (Table 1). Furthermore, age-
adjusted concentrations of retinol, serum retinyl esters,
vitamin C, serum folate, carotenoids, and selenium were
significantly and inversely associated with C-reactive protein
concentration.
These findings persisted after further adjustment for race
or ethnicity, education, cotinine concentration, body mass
index, leisure-time physical activity, and aspirin use in
logistic regression models (Table 2). Comparing the highest
with the lowest quartiles, inverse associations were noted
between C-reactive protein concentration and retinol
(OR ¼ 0.56, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.68), retinyl esters (OR ¼ 0.68,
95% CI: 0.57, 0.80), vitamin C (OR ¼ 0.56, 95% CI: 0.46,

selenium (OR ¼ 0.75, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.89). Furthermore, the
P-values for the tests for linear trend for all these analytes
were significant. Additional adjustment for serum total
cholesterol concentration had a minimal effect on the odds
ratios.
We further examined the associations between C-reactive
protein concentration and concentrations of carotenoids,
vitamins, and selenium by age, sex, race or ethnicity, body
mass index, and vitamin or supplement use. No evidence
was found that the relationships between C-reactive protein
status and the exposure variables differed among vitamin or
mineral users or nonusers. The interaction terms between
age and b-cryptoxanthin concentration (P ¼ 0.015) and age
and lutein/zeaxanthin concentration (P ¼ 0.047) were sig-
nificant. An inverse association between b-cryptoxanthin
concentration and C-reactive protein concentration was
present among three age strata (20­44, 45­64 and Z65 y),
but the association for the youngest age group was more like
a threshold response in contrast to clear dose­response
associations in the other two age groups. Lutein/zeaxanthin
concentration was significantly and inversely associated
with C-reactive protein concentration among participants
aged Z65 y only. Only a single significant interaction for
race or ethnicity was noted for b-carotene concentration
(P ¼ 0.016). However, among all three groups a significant
inverse association was observed.
With the exception of vitamin E, inverse associations
between C-reactive protein concentration and concentra-
tions of retinol, retinyl esters, a-, b-carotene, lycopene, and
selenium were noted for men and for women. Differences in
the strength of the dose­response of the inverse associations
accounted for the significant interactions. For men, the
relationships between C-reactive protein concentration and
concentrations of retinol and retinyl esters were somewhat
more prominent than the relationships among women.
Vitamin E concentration was inversely associated with C-
reactive protein concentration in men (P ¼ 0.004) and
positively associated with C-reactive protein concentration
in women (P ¼ 0.002). The inverse relationships between C-
reactive protein concentration and a-, b-carotene, and
lycopene concentrations appeared to be stronger among
women than men.
Body mass index was a significant modifier of the
relationship between C-reactive protein status and concen-
trations of retinol, vitamin C, serum folate, a-carotene, and
b-cryptoxanthin. Although inverse relationships were noted

at each level of body mass index (o25 and Z25 kg/m2), the
shape of these associations tended to exhibit more of a dose­
response effect among overweight or obese participants than
participants with a normal body mass index.
Vitamin C concentration was inversely related to C-
reactive protein status for each level of smoking status, but
appeared to be more pronounced among smokers (Table 3).
Vitamin E concentration showed more of a threshold
relationship with C-reactive protein status among smokers
and was not related to C-reactive protein status among
former smokers or participants who had never smoked. b-
Cryptoxanthin concentration showed a threshold response
to C-reactive protein status among smokers and dose­
response relationships among former smokers and partici-
pants who never smoked. Selenium was inversely related to
C-reactive protein status among smokers but not among the
other two groups.
Fruit and vegetable consumption, estimated from the
food-frequency questionnaire, was not significantly related
to C-reactive protein status in multiple logistic regression
analysis (Z150 times per month vs o150 times per month:
P ¼ 0.288; per time per month: P ¼ 0.610).
Discussion
Using data from a large cross-sectional survey of US adults,
we found that C-reactive protein concentration was inver-
sely associated with concentrations of several vitamins,
carotenoids, and selenium, independent of age, sex, race or
ethnicity. These findings are generally consistent with and
extend the results from previously published studies that
have examined the associations between C-reactive protein
concentration and various blood concentrations of carote-
noids and vitamins in small and special samples of
participants. Because fruits and vegetables are rich sources
of vitamins and carotenoids, any favorable effect of these
phytonutrients on C-reactive protein concentration would
make for an attractive hypothesis in partially explaining the
benefits of adequate consumption of these foods in prevent-
ing coronary heart disease. However, we were unable to
demonstrate a significant inverse association between fruit
and vegetable intake and C-reactive protein concentration.
Although the two may be unrelated, the fruit and vegetable
measure that we used may have been too inexact to detect
any significant association. Since so little is known about
associations between fruit and vegetable intake and inflam-
matory markers, additional studies are needed.
We found a number of significant interactions, which is
partially due to the large sample size. However, inverse
associations between blood analytes and C-reactive protein
concentration were present for most of the sex, body mass
index, and smoking strata. The significant interactions
appeared to be driven mostly by differences in the slopes
or the shapes of the associations. However, the associations
between vitamin E concentration and C-reactive protein
concentration differed among men (inverse) and women
(positive). The reason for these different associations is not

immediately apparent and, given the number of interactions
that we tested, may have been due to chance.
In previous studies, researchers have examined some of
these relationships in patients with various conditions or
other select populations. In a study of nuns aged 77­99 y, C-
reactive protein concentration was inversely related to
plasma concentrations of a-, b-carotene, lycopene, and total
carotenoids (Boosalis et al, 1996). Among Chinese women,
plasma retinol concentration was inversely related to C-
reactive protein concentration (Root et al, 1999). Among
patients with type II diabetes mellitus, vitamin E supple-
mentation of 800 U/day resulted in decreases of C-reactive
protein concentrations (Upritchard et al, 2000). Inverse
relations between C-reactive protein concentrations and
concentrations of retinol, vitamin C, tocopherol, and lutein
have been noted among patients with lung cancer (Talwar
et al, 1997) and acute pancreatitis (Curran et al, 2000) and
among those undergoing orthopedic surgery (Louw et al,
1992). Furthermore, vitamins A, C, and E decrease transi-
ently during the course of an acute myocardial infarction
(Labadarios et al, 1987). Among patients with gastrointest-
inal cancer, those with an elevated C-reactive protein
concentration had lower concentrations of vitamins and
minerals than patients with a normal C-reactive protein
concentration (McMillan et al, 2000). Similarly, among
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer, those with an
elevated C-reactive protein concentration had lower con-
centrations of selenium than those with a normal C-reactive
protein concentration (Sattar et al, 1997).
Recently, the relationships between C-reactive protein
concentration and concentrations of carotenoids were
examined using NHANES III data (Kritchevsky et al, 2000).
The authors limited their analysis to participants aged 25­
55 y. The inverse association between b-carotene concentra-
tion and C-reactive protein concentration in NHANES III
data was subsequently the focus of another report (Erlinger
et al, 2001). Our analysis of the entire NHANES III extends
these findings to a broader set of participants. In addition,
we explored several possible sources of effect modification
including age, sex, smoking status, and body mass index.
Furthermore, results of a recent analysis of NHANES III data
also demonstrated an inverse association between concen-
trations of serum retinol and C-reactive protein in children
and adults (Stephensen & Gildengorin, 2000).
The method used to measure C-reactive protein concen-
tration in NHANES III is not a sensitive one, and, therefore, a
large number of participants had concentrations below the
detection limit of 3.0 mg/l. This limited our ability to explore
the full range of the associations of C-reactive protein
concentrations and circulating concentrations of vitamins,
carotenoids, and selenium.
Since this is a cross-sectional study, the directionality of
the associations is uncertain. Thus, inflammation could
depress concentrations of some vitamins, carotenoids, and
selenium. Both endogenous and exogenous sources of
antioxidants serve to counteract the reactive oxygen species,
produced during the inflammatory process, limiting or
preventing cellular or subcellular damage. Unless the pools
of antioxidants are augmented by increased intake or
production, the increase in reactive oxygen species from
inflammation may deplete these pools resulting in lower
concentrations of antioxidants. Findings of a study of
patients with type II diabetes mellitus which showed no
change in C-reactive protein concentration after supplemen-
tation with tomato juice, a rich source of lycopene, support
this explanation (Upritchard et al, 2000). It would be of
interest to know whether trials of antioxidant supplementa-
tion were more effective among those with an elevated C-
reactive protein concentration. Triggers of the acute-phase
response result in transient decreases of serum retinol
concentration and retinol binding protein (Filteau, 1999;
Stephensen, 2001).
The alternative explanation that higher antioxidant con-
centrations could reduce inflammation deserves considera-
tion. Sufficient supplies of antioxidants could conceivably
mitigate the inflammatory process. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and lipid peroxidation can promote the production of
proinflammatory cytokines. By neutralizing excess concen-
trations of ROS, increased concentrations of antioxidants
could directly reduce one stimulus for increases in proin-
flammatory cytokines and indirectly reduce a second
stimulus by reducing lipid peroxidation. For example,
oxidized LDL cholesterol is a stimulus of inflammation
(Berliner et al, 1995; Massy et al, 2000). If antioxidants could
prevent or reduce the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, some of
the inflammatory stimulus could be reduced. In addition,
antioxidants may prevent the activation of the transcription
factor nuclear factor-kB, which has been shown to affect the
expression of genes that promote inflammation (Valen et al,
2001). Thus, adequate antioxidant concentration may be
especially critical early in people's lives when atherosclerosis
is initiated.
Additional studies are needed to examine the relationships
between concentrations of inflammatory markers and anti-
oxidants and to determine the causal relationships under-
lying these associations. For example, supplementation
studies among people with elevated C-reactive protein
concentrations may reveal whether antioxidants have an
effect on the inflammatory process and if they do, which
ones are more likely to be effective. Dietary studies may also
provide valuable insights into how dietary factors may
directly affect the inflammatory process or limit the damage
it causes. Data showing that antioxidants and foods rich in
antioxidants limit the inflammatory process or its secondary
effects would provide additional support for current recom-
mendations regarding fruit and vegetable intake.
