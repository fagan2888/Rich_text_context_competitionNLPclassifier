ONLY half of older adults in the United States with
a probable diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or psy-
chotic disorder use mental health services (Klap, Unroe, &
Unützer, 2003). Perceiving need for mental health care
(MHC) is an important step in deciding whether to seek
treatment (Mechanic, 1978; Mojtabai, Olfson, & Mechanic,
2002), but little is known about how older adults determine
their need for MHC. Existing studies either exclude elderly
people (Katz, Kessler, Frank, Leaf, & Lin, 1997; Mojtabai
et al.), do not account for subsyndromal conditions (Klap
et al.; Meadows et al., 2002), or use care utilization as a
proxy for perceived need (Mojtabai et al.; Rabinowitz,
Gross, & Feldman, 1999). Not everyone who receives MHC
may perceive a need for care; others may demand that a
person utilize mental health services (Edlund, Unützer, &
Curran, 2006). In this study, we examine the relationship of
perceived need for MHC (regardless of utilization rates)
with past-year mental illness, history of mental and physical
illness, subsyndromal conditions, and history of alcohol
abuse and/or dependence.
Our study is based on principles from the common
sense model of illness representation (CSM; Diefenbach &
Leventhal, 1996). The CSM states that individuals make
treatment decisions based on illness beliefs regarding symp-
tom identity, acuity and/or chronicity, severity, causes, and
controllability. These beliefs are influenced by prior experi-
ence with a condition and information from social network
members. From this model, we believe history and severity
of mental illness, chronic physical illness history, alcohol
abuse, attitudes toward MHC, and social support will influ-
ence perceived need for MHC in older adults.
Mental illness history may increase likelihood of per-
ceived need for MHC in two ways. First, individuals with a
history of depression or anxiety who currently meet diag-
nostic criteria for one of the two conditions might draw on
previous experience with the condition and infer that they
should use care (Howard Leventhal, personal communica-
tion, October 15, 2008). Secondly, individuals with a his-
tory of depression or anxiety who do not currently meet
diagnostic criteria for either disorder might feel continued
treatment is necessary for maintaining current health status.
History of depression and history of anxiety are related to
MHC utilization in the general population (Burns, Wagner,
Gaynes, Wells, & Schulberg, 2000; Ronalds et al., 2002);
the relationship between history of mental illness and per-
ceived need in older adults is unclear.
Additionally, subsyndromal depression and anxiety and
greater numbers of depression or anxiety symptoms might be
associated with perceived need for care. Subsyndromal levels
of depression and anxiety are associated with physical dis-
ability and poor physical health, in some cases to the same
degree as major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD; Beekman, Deeg, Braam, Smit, &
Tilburg, 1997; De Beurs et al., 1999; Johnson, Weissman, &
Klerman, 1992). Furthermore, it is likely more difficult to
ignore or explain away symptoms as they proliferate; having
more co-occurring adverse symptoms may encourage indi-
viduals to view symptom clusters as medical conditions war-
ranting treatment. Greater numbers of depression and GAD
symptoms are associated with higher odds of perceived need
for depression treatment in younger adults with probable de-
pression (Van Voorhees et al., 2006).
In addition to mental illness history, physical illness his-
tory may be related to perceived need for MHC. Occurrence

health status, among people experiencing mental illness

Only half of older adults with a mental disorder use mental health services, and little is known about the causes of
perceived need for mental health care (MHC). We used logistic regression to examine relationships among depres-
sion, anxiety, chronic physical illness, alcohol abuse and/or dependence, sociodemographics, and perceived need
among a national sample of community-dwelling individuals 65 years of age and older (the Collaborative Psychiat-
ric Epidemiology Surveys data set). Less than half of respondents with depression or anxiety perceived a need for
care. Perceived need was greater for respondents with more symptoms of depression regardless of whether they met
diagnostic criteria for a mental illness. History of chronic physical conditions, history of depression or anxiety, and
more severe mental illness were associated with greater perceived need for MHC. Future studies of perceived need
should account for individual perceptions of mental illness and treatment and the influence of social networks.

PERCEIVED NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE 705
symptoms is associated with greater perceived need for
MHC (Mojtabai et al., 2002; Rabinowitz et al., 1999). Ex-
perience with chronic conditions likely reflects experience
receiving medical treatment, whereas self-rated health is
only indirectly associated with treatment experience. Prior
experience (good or bad) with mental health treatment is
related to greater odds of perceived need for care in younger
adults (Van Voorhees et al., 2006). Furthermore, lower utili-
zation of mental health services occurs in those without a
regular source of medical care (Leaf et al., 1985). A history
of receiving treatment for any condition may lead individu-
als to medicalize symptoms and believe that mental health
services are beneficial.
Little is known about the association of alcohol abuse and/
or dependence with perceived need for MHC in older adults.
There is mixed evidence as to whether alcohol abuse itself
increases the likelihood of perceived need for MHC (Edlund
et al., 2006; Mojtabai et al., 2002; Sareen, Cox, Afifi, Clara,
& Yu, 2005). The relationship may depend on abuse and/or
dependence severity and whether comorbid mental illnesses
are present. In people with mental illnesses, subclinical alco-
hol dependence symptoms are related to lower odds of MHC
use, but three or more symptoms of alcohol dependence are
related to greater odds of care use (Wu, Kouzis, & Leaf,
1999). This suggests that people with some depressive symp-
toms who do not meet criteria for alcohol dependence may
use alcohol to self-medicate. If alcohol ameliorates the symp-
toms of anxiety or depression, individuals might not perceive
a need for mental health treatment. Once they are dependent
on alcohol, however, self-medication may be ineffective and
lead to perceived need for treatment.
In addition to illness characteristics, social support may
affect perceived need for MHC. Ill people often turn to so-
cial network members to compare symptoms and experi-
ences and to discover where others have sought treatment
(Leventhal, Musumeci, & Leventhal, 2008). Additionally,
those with supportive networks might feel their needs are
met within the network and may have decreased perceived
need for formal treatment. Little is known about the rela-
tionship between social network quality and perceived need
for care in older adults, although better quality social sup-
port is related to less utilization of physical health care and
MHC in younger populations (Broadhead, Gehlbach, de-
Gruy, & Kaplan, 1989; Horwitz, 1977).
Attitudes toward MHC are another important determinant
of perceived need. Fear of stigma, negative views of others
with mental illness, lack of confidence in mental health ser-
vices, and fear of medication side effects are reasons people
do not seek MHC (Cooper-Patrick et al., 1997; Robb, Haley,
Becker, Polivka, & Chwa, 2003; Segal, Coolidge, Mincic, &
O'Riley, 2005). Positive attitudes toward MHC are correlated
with greater likelihood of perceived need for care in younger
adults (Mojtabai et al., 2002).
Finally, sociodemographic characteristics are also associ-
ated with perceived need. Some evidence suggests that rates of
perceived need are highest among middle-aged adults (Edlund
et al., 2006; Meadows et al., 2002) and women (Edlund et al.;
Mojtabai et al., 2002). Racial differences in perceived need are
not always found (Edlund et al.; Meadows et al.; Mojtabai
et al.), but some have found lower rates of perceived need in
Asians than in Whites (Sareen et al., 2005).
To examine relationships among perceived need and
mental and physical health, we used cross-sectional data
from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys
(CPES), which surveyed community-dwelling adults
throughout the contiguous United States about their mental
health symptoms and health service utilization. We expected
to see greater odds of perceived need for MHC among older
adults with more severe past-year or history of mental ill-
ness, a history of greater numbers of chronic physical con-
ditions, and a history of alcohol abuse or dependence.
Information on attitudes toward care and consistent mea-
sures of social support were not available for all members of
our sample and were excluded from analyses.
Methods
The CPES merges data collected between 2001 and
2003 from three large studies of mental health: the Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), the Na-
tional Survey of American Life (NSAL), and the National
Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS). Samples
were obtained via four stages: Metropolitan Statistical Ar-
eas (MSAs) and counties, segments within each primary
stage, households within segments, and random selection
of one respondent per household (Heeringa et al., 2004).
(In 20% of the NCS-R households, two adults were inter-
viewed.) The data include sampling weights to account for
different probabilities of selection among survey compo-
nents and oversampling of racial and ethnic minorities.
Further details of the survey methods are described else-
where (Heeringa et al.; Kessler et al., 2004).
The merged data include 20,013 adult respondents, 2,626
of whom are 65 years of age or older. We excluded NCS-R
respondents who responded to a shortened version of the sur-
vey, and only 25% of NLAAS respondents were asked about
perceived need in order to reduce respondent burden for a fi-
nal sample size of 1,339 (NCS-R: n = 687, NLAAS: n = 93,
NSAL: n = 559). We retained the small set of NLAAS re-
spondents to increase the racial diversity of the sample.
Sample demographics match national demographics from
the 2000 United States Census. According to the census,
83.6% of the U.S. population is White non-Latino, 8.1% is
African American, and 44.5% is male (United States Census,
2000). Our sample included 86.7% White non-Latino, 8.6%
African American, and 42.9% male respondents.
Variables

past 12 months, and the explanatory variables were diagnoses

and symptoms of mental illness, number of chronic physical
illnesses, history of alcohol abuse and/or dependence symp-
toms, and sociodemographic characteristics.
Perceived need for MHC.--Respondents who received
MHC in the past 12 months (from a psychiatrist, psycholo-
gist, social worker, counselor, physical health care provider,
religious or spiritual provider, or alternative medicine prac-
titioner) were asked if they sought care voluntarily. Respon-
dents who did not receive MHC in the past year were asked
if they felt a need to seek professional care for emotional or
substance abuse issues. Consistent with another study of
perceived need among NCS respondents (Katz et al., 1997),
we categorized respondents as perceiving a need for care if
they indicated care seeking was voluntary or if they felt they
needed to see a mental health professional. Of those who
perceived need for care, there is likely a difference between
those who used care and did not use care, but the analysis of
this difference is beyond the scope of this article.
Prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety.--
Probable diagnoses were ascertained with algorithms from
the World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative's adap-
tation of the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0; Kessler &
Üstün, 2004). These algorithms determined whether re-
spondents met the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria (without hierarchy) for
MDD, dysthymia, GAD, and/or another anxiety disorder
(post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia with or without
panic disorder, panic attack, panic disorder, and social pho-
bia; American Psychological Association [APA], 1994).
(Information on other anxiety disorders such as obsessive­
compulsive disorder or specific phobia was not available for
most respondents in our data set.) We characterized respon-
dents' mental illness experience with two variables: "past
year," which refers to those who met diagnostic criteria for
a disorder in the past 12 months (regardless of other, earlier
experience with mental illness) and "history," which refers
to those who satisfied lifetime diagnostic criteria for a dis-
order but who did not meet that criterion in the past year.
History among those who had met past-year diagnostic cri-
teria was not available. All diagnoses and time periods refer
to algorithms within the CIDI; none are self-reported. The
WMH CIDI 3.0 was designed for epidemiological studies
and has good concordance with the Structured Clinical In-
terview for DSM-IV (SCID) for diagnosing any anxiety dis-
order (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve
[AUC] = 0.88) and any mood disorder (AUC = 0.83) in the
past 12 months (Haro et al., 2006).
In addition to diagnostic criteria, we counted the num-
ber of symptoms of depression and GAD in the WMH
CIDI. Depression symptoms included depressed mood,
anhedonia, weight gain or loss, difficulties sleeping, psy-
chomotor agitation or slowing, fatigue, feelings of worth-
lessness, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal ideation.
Respondents were asked about depression symptoms if
they reported ever having at least one 2-week period of
depression or a year or more with several shorter periods
of depression; they were asked about symptoms that oc-
curred during the worst episode of depression they experi-
enced in their lifetimes. All others were coded as having
zero symptoms. GAD symptoms included occupation with
nervousness or worries, restlessness, fatigue, irritability,
difficulty concentrating, muscle fatigue, and difficulty
sleeping. Symptoms referred to those that occurred during
the worst episode of anxiety they experienced in their life-
times; respondents without a worst episode were coded as
having zero symptoms. Full lists of symptoms specific to
past-year episodes were unavailable. Because the meaning
of the number of symptoms of non-GAD anxiety disorders
could vary widely depending on the disorder, we did not
include a symptom count variable for these disorders.
We constructed new algorithms for diagnoses of sub-
syndromal GAD and minor depression over respondents'
lifetimes. We modeled subsyndromal GAD diagnoses af-
ter a previous study of the condition (Carter, Wittchen,
Pfister, & Kessler, 2001) and the minor depression diag-
noses reflect DSM-IV criteria for further study (APA,
1994). The symptoms reported for these conditions were
reported during respondents' worst-ever episode of de-
pression or anxiety.
People tend to report fewer symptoms of past episodes of
depression with time and are less likely to report symptoms
when they are not experiencing psychological distress
(Aneshensel, Estrada, Hansell, & Clark, 1987). Perception of
severity and number of symptoms that respondents recall ex-
periencing are likely important factors influencing perceived
need, regardless of whether recall is perfectly accurate.
Physical health and cognitive functioning.--Respondents
were asked if a health professional had ever told them they
had heart troubles, ulcers, cancer, hypertension, diabetes,
asthma, or chronic lung disease; we summed the number of
conditions reported. Numbers of chronic conditions are
correlated with length of hospital stay, increased physical
limitations, and increased mortality (Elixhauser, Steiner,
Harris, & Coffey, 1998;Verbrugge, Lepkowski, & Imanaka,
1989).
Because a global measure of self-assessed health was not
available, we substituted a measure of functional limitation.
Functional limitations are highly correlated with self-assessed
health (Mora, DiBonaventura, Idler, Leventhal, & Leventhal,
2008). Cognitive functioning, self-care ability, and mobility
were measured by the World Health Organization Disability
Assessment Schedule II (WHO-DAS II; Kessler et al., 2003;
WHO, 2001). Scores are a product of frequency (number of
days) and severity of problems (none, mild, moderate, severe)
respondents reported experiencing in the past 30 days and are
normalized to have values ranging from 0 to 100, where
PERCEIVED NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE 707
higher numbers indicate worse functioning. We transformed
the scores into z scores in the multivariate analyses.
Prevalence of alcohol abuse and/or dependence.--Past-
year, historical, and lifetime diagnoses of alcohol abuse and
dependence were assessed by the WMH CIDI. The WMH
CIDI and SCID have good specificity for diagnoses of alco-
hol abuse (AUC = 0.81), and alcohol dependence (0.72;
Kessler et al., 2005). We also counted the number of alcohol
abuse and dependence symptoms ever experienced. Depen-
dence symptoms included tolerance, withdrawal, drinking
or becoming drunk when unintended, inability to reduce
drinking, spending many days recovering from drinking,
drinking instead of doing social activities or working, and
drinking although knowing it was leading to health prob-
lems. Abuse symptoms included failure to fulfill role obli-
gations, use in dangerous settings, and continued use despite
social problems.
Sociodemographics.--Sociodemographics included age,
sex, race (White non-Latino, African American and
Afro-Caribbean, and other), marital status, education,
household size, and poverty index. The poverty index is
the ratio of household income to the poverty threshold
used in the 2001 Census (adjusted for household size).
Analyses
Analyses were performed with SAS-callable SUDAAN.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine rela-
tionships among illness characteristics, sociodemographics,
and perceived need for care. Variables were entered simul-
taneously in all models; only variables that were present in
each component of the CPES were included in our analyses.
The regression was run separately with the entire sample for
two different sets of mental health variables: a diagnosis
model with variables for past-year and history of mental
illness diagnoses, and a symptom model with counts of
symptoms occurring during the worst episode of illness re-
spondents had experienced in their lives. Due to small cell
sizes, lifetime diagnoses for minor depression, dysthymia,
and alcohol abuse and/or dependence were excluded from
analyses. The relatively low prevalence of co-occurring
mental illnesses, perceived need, and alcohol abuse pre-
cluded us from examining interaction terms in the complete
models. An additional model was run on the subsample of
respondents who never met diagnostic criteria for depres-
sion or anxiety to explore relationships possibly obscured
by the strong relationship between diagnosis and perceived
need for care. We tested for interactions between depression
and/or anxiety and alcohol abuse and/or dependence in
models unadjusted for physical health or sociodemograph-
ics. Akaike's information criterion with a second-order cor-
rection (AICc) for small sample sizes was used to compare
models (Burnham & Anderson, 2002; Sugiura, 1978).
Results
The mean age of respondents was 74.6 years, and 9.3%
were 85 years of age or older. Few (2.5%) respondents met
past-year diagnostic criteria for MDD, but 6.9% of respon-
dents had a history of MDD. Only 2.3% had met criteria
for minor depression at some point in their lives. Of those
who reported at least one episode of depression over their
lifetimes, the mean number of symptoms reported was 0.8
(SE = 0.1; range = 0­9). Few (1.6%) met diagnostic criteria
for GAD in the past year, but 2.7% had a history of GAD and
5.1% met criteria for subthreshold GAD at some point in
their lives. Of those who recalled an episode of anxiety dur-
ing their lifetime, the mean number of symptoms reported
was 0.6 (SE = 0.1, range = 0­7). Past-year diagnostic criteria
for non-GAD anxiety disorders were met by 5.4% of respon-
dents; historical diagnostic criteria were met by 13.7%. Of
the sample, 4.6% reported any symptoms of alcohol abuse
and/or dependence over their lifetime. Respondents experi-
enced a mean of 1.3 chronic physical conditions (SE = 0.1).
Of the entire sample, 7.3% (157) perceived a need for
MHC in the past year. Of those who perceived a need for
MHC, 82.8% (130) had voluntarily received MHC from a
primary care provider or mental health specialist in the past
12 months, and 17.2% (27) perceived a need for care but did
not receive care. In bivariate analyses, perceived need for
care was less likely as age increased, and it was more likely
to be reported by women and unmarried respondents (Table 1).
Perceived need was more likely for respondents with MDD,
dysthymia, GAD, subthreshold GAD, and other anxiety dis-
orders than for those without diagnoses, but not everyone
who met diagnostic criteria perceived a need for care. Half
of respondents who met diagnostic criteria for MDD or
GAD in the past year perceived a need for care. Conversely,
4.7% of those who did not meet criteria for depression or
anxiety in the past year perceived a need for care.
People with perceived need had significantly more de-
pression (M = 3.0, SE = 0.4) and GAD symptoms (M = 2.4,
SE = 0.3) at some point in their lifetimes than those who did
not perceive need (depression: M = 0.7, SE = 0.1; GAD:
M = 0.5, SE = 0.1). Perceived need also was more likely
among respondents reporting any alcohol abuse and/or depen-
dence symptoms than among those without any symptoms.
Tests for interactions between depression and alcohol
abuse and/or dependence in models unadjusted for physical
health or sociodemographics failed to find significant results.
There was, however, a significant interaction between past-
year GAD and number of alcohol abuse and/or dependence
symptoms. In this model, alcohol symptoms alone were not
related to perceived need, but past-year GAD and past-year
GAD with alcohol abuse and/or dependence symptoms were
associated with greater likelihood of perceived need (odds
ratio [OR] = 10.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.44­
26.15; OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.01­1.81, respectively).
Respondents with worse WHO-DAS cognitive function-
ing and mobility scores were more likely to perceive need

for care. The odds of reporting perceived need were higher
with greater numbers of chronic physical conditions ever
experienced.
Multivariate Analyses
In multivariate logistic regression analyses, model fit was
slightly better when symptoms over the respondent's lifetimes
were included as regressors (AICc = 568.0) rather than past-
year diagnoses and history of diagnoses (AICc = 579.1).
Diagnosis model.--When the model included past-year
and historical diagnoses of depression and anxiety, both
past-year MDD and history of MDD were significantly re-
lated to perceived need (Table 2). Past-year GAD was re-
lated to perceived need, but history of GAD was not.
Lifetime incidence of subthreshold GAD was related to
higher odds of perceived need. Respondents with past-year
and history of a non-GAD anxiety disorder were more like-
ly to perceive a need for care than those without an anxiety
disorder. The number of chronic conditions ever experi-
enced was related to perceived need as well.
Symptom model.--When the model substituted counts of
MDD and GAD symptoms experienced during worst life-
time episodes of illness for diagnoses, the odds of perceiv-
ing a need for MHC were higher with more depression
symptoms and more GAD symptoms (Table 2). As in the
diagnosis model, the odds of perceived need for care were
higher when respondents had a past-year anxiety disorder
other than GAD and when respondents had a lifetime his-
tory of more chronic physical conditions. Unlike the diag-
nosis model, however, history of non-GAD anxiety was not
related to perceived need in the symptom model. Perceived
need was more likely for those who had ever experienced
symptoms of alcohol abuse and/or dependence. Men were
half as likely to report perceived need as women.
PERCEIVED NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE 709
Perceived need among those without depression and/or
anxiety.--Among respondents who had never met diagnos-
tic criteria for depression or anxiety, the number of depres-
sion symptoms was still significantly related to perceived need
(Table 2). Anxiety symptoms, however, were not related to
perceived need. Additionally, men were less likely to per-
ceive a need for care than women, and respondents with a
history of more chronic physical conditions were more like-
ly to report perceived need.
Discussion
As predicted, respondents with more severe mental ill-
nesses, a history of depression or anxiety, and/or a history
of chronic physical illnesses and alcohol abuse and/or de-
pendence symptoms were more likely to perceive a need for
MHC. Past experience with illnesses and treatment, in addi-
tion to symptom severity, may influence individuals' per-
ceptions of control over depression and anxiety and thus
influence perceptions of need for formal MHC according to
the CSM (Diefenbach & Leventhal, 1996).
A history of depression or non-GAD anxiety was associ-
ated with higher odds of perceived need. This suggests that
older adults whose mental health condition has improved
according to diagnostic criteria may still experience distress
or feel they could benefit from further treatment. Alterna-
tively, according to the CSM, those who met past-year diag-
nostic criteria for depression or anxiety and have a history
of the disorder may draw on past experience with the condi-
tion to evaluate how they might rid themselves of the symp-
toms most quickly and be more likely to perceive a need for
MHC (Howard Leventhal, personal communication, Octo-
ber 15, 2008); their past experience may affect assessment
of their present condition. From these data, we could not
determine the relationship of history and perceived need for
those with past-year depression and/or anxiety nor could we
determine whether respondents had received treatment for
the specific past episodes they reported.
People meeting diagnostic criteria for MDD or GAD had
higher odds of perceived need than those with subsyndromal
conditions, but subthreshold GAD and number of depres-
sion and anxiety symptoms were still significantly associ-
ated with perceived need. These results, along with the fact
that perceived need for MHC is associated with psychologi-
cal distress and suicidality regardless of whether one meets
diagnostic criteria for a disorder (Sareen et al., 2005),
suggest that diagnostic criteria may not always reflect indi-
vidual assessments of depression and anxiety. Although
diagnostic criteria are correlated with perceived need, these

results indicate that individuals' perceptions of need are
also affected by subclinical symptoms. Perceptions of se-
verity or the extent to which symptoms interfere with daily
life for those not meeting past-year criteria for MDD or
GAD may lead older adults to perceive a need for care. In-
creased symptom intrusiveness into daily life is associated
with greater distress for physical conditions (Delahanty
et al., 2007), but little is known about the relationship be-
tween mental illness intrusiveness and perceived need for
care among older adults.
Perceived need was significantly more likely when indi-
viduals reported a lifetime occurrence of more chronic
physical conditions. Respondents who needed chronic care
in the past likely have more experience receiving care in
formal settings and may be more accepting of medical
treatment. This in turn may increase the likelihood of view-
ing psychological symptoms as a target for care from a pri-
mary care provider or mental health specialist. Those with
fewer problems may be more likely to rely on themselves
or informal resources for emotional support. This is sup-
ported by the fact that none of the more general measures
of physical health status were significantly related to per-
ceived need in multivariate analyses; it is not the physical
health status, but the experience with medical care that is
related to perceived need.
The relationship between alcohol abuse and/or depen-
dence and perceived need was not affected by depression,
but it was affected by anxiety. When alcohol use was exam-
ined as an interaction term with past-year GAD, alcohol
abuse and/or dependence was only significantly associated
with perceived need for those with past-year GAD. From
these results, it seems that alcohol abuse may be a reason
for perceived need on its own or perhaps when used as inef-
fective self-medication for anxiety. Because alcohol abuse
symptom reports might have been reduced by social desir-
ability bias, those who reported any symptoms likely had
worse experiences with alcohol. It remains to be seen
whether older adults who have some, but not many, symp-
toms of alcohol abuse are less likely to perceive a need for
care because they are self-medicating.
Future studies should include more specific measures
of the decision-making process leading to perceived need
for care. They should include individuals' assessments
of symptom "identity, timeline, cause, controllability, and
consequences" (as stipulated in the CSM; Diefenbach &
Leventhal, 1996, p. 20), along with measures of the impact
of social networks and general attitudes toward mental
health on individual assessments. If people with more sup-
portive social networks are less likely to perceive a need for
care, it will be important to determine the relative benefits
of supportive social networks versus formal MHC in ad-
dressing mental health issues. If social networks are inhibit-
ing members from receiving care that may potentially
improve their symptoms, educational interventions about
the benefits of formal MHC may be useful.
Many respondents who met past-year diagnostic criteria
for MDD or GAD did not perceive a need for care. There
are several reasons why this may have occurred: they may
have negative attitudes about mental illness and MHC,
they might feel their interactions with social networks are
suitable substitutes for formal MHC, or their interactions
with social networks may lead them to have negative atti-
tudes toward care. Although our data set did not allow us
to examine these relationships, it is an important area for
future research.
Individuals' perceptions of symptoms and severity are re-
lated to whether they perceive need for MHC, and perceived
need is an important determinant of whether individuals de-
cide to seek care (Mechanic, 1978). Understanding the type
and development of these perceptions is central to develop-
ing an effective care plan and strategy for working with
older people with depression and anxiety.
Limitations
Our analyses are limited by the cross-sectional nature of
the data; we cannot show causal associations. Because we
used secondary data, some useful information was unavail-
able due to differing skip patterns for some questions in the
components of the merged data set (e.g., self-rated physical
health was not available for all respondents). Past-year
chronic conditions and symptom counts, attitudes toward
care, and consistent social support measures are not avail-
able in all components of the CPES. It would have been
ideal to have consistent time frames for measures of past-
year physical and mental health. Furthermore, because of
the relatively low prevalence of minor depression and dys-
thymia, this study had limited power to examine some rela-
tionships between illness characteristics and perceived need.
An ideal model would have also included measures of self-
assessed physical and mental health, attitudes toward care,
quality of social support, and more health measures specific
to the past 12 months. Finally, the results of this study can-
not be extended to individuals with cognitive disabilities or
dementia who have proxies making health care decisions.
The CPES data used in this study, however, are the most
comprehensive data related to MHC in older adults.
Conclusion
Few studies have examined perceived need for mental
health services in older adults. This study examines the re-
lationships between perceived need for care, patient mental
and physical illness, and sociodemographics in the frame-
work of the common sense model.
Histories of MDD and non-GAD anxiety were related
to perceived need. Among respondents who did not meet
diagnostic criteria for depression or anxiety, the number of
depression symptoms ever experienced was related to per-
ceived need. This suggests that providers should be sensi-
tive to symptom reports and individual assessments, even
PERCEIVED NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE 711
if they do not meet the diagnostic threshold for depression.
Conversely, many who met diagnostic criteria for depres-
sion or anxiety disorders in the past year did not perceive
a need for MHC. It is important for these patients to un-
derstand the importance of care for depression and anxi-
ety, as these conditions are related to poor physical health
outcomes and increased mortality risk.
Depression and anxiety symptoms are experienced by a
considerable portion of community-dwelling older individu-
als, but symptoms are not a sufficient condition for perceived
need. Future studies should focus on how individual percep-
tions of mental illness and social network interaction influ-
ence whether individuals perceive a need for care and whether
they seek treatment. Future studies also should examine the
association between perceived need and utilization and
whether need and utilization are related to illness characteris-
tics and psychosocial factors in similar ways. Understanding
processes that lead older adults to perceive need for treatment
and decide whether to seek treatment could improve MHC
utilization rates, which could lead to improved physical and
mental health status as well as reduced health care costs.
