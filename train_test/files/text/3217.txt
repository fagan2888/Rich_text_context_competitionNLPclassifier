Abstract:
Macroeconomic risk assessments play an important role in the forecasts of many
institutions. A risk forecast is related to the potential asymmetry of the forecast
density. In this work, we investigate how the optimality of such risk forecasts can
be tested. We nd that the Pearson mode skewness outperforms the standard
third-moment-based skewness as a measure of asymmetry. We consider problems
of the tests likely to be encountered in practice and try to oer remedies where
possible. In general, tests for macroeconomic risk forecast optimality tend to have
at best moderate power given the empirically available small sample sizes.

Non-technical summary
Many central banks supplement their macroeconomic forecasts with an assess-
ment of future risks, where a risk implies an asymmetry of the forecast density.
Put dierently, the presence of an upward risk commonly implies that outturns
greater than the point forecast have a probability of more than 50%. Accordingly,
the presence of a downward risk means that outturns less than the point forecast
have a probability of more than 50%.
In this work, we investigate how macroeconomic risk forecasts can be evaluated.
A typical problem of these evaluations is the small sample size of currently available
risk forecasts. As a start, we nd that an evaluation should not be based on the
standard measure of asymmetry for probability density functions (the skewness),
because an alternative measure, the Pearson mode skewness, allows a markedly
more precise evaluation in small samples.
We also consider several problems to be encountered in practice and try to
oer remedies where possible. For example, if the width of the forecast density,
i.e. the dispersion of the forecast errors is systematically over- or underestimated,
a certain test for the optimality of risk forecasts tends to yield misleading results.
However, a modication of this test leads to correct results.
A general conclusion of the investigations presented is that tests for the op-
timality of macroeconomic risk forecasts cannot be expected to be very powerful
given the mostly very small sample sizes which are currently available. So, it is
not unlikely that no statistical evidence against the optimality of risk forecasts can
be found, even if optimality is not present, i.e. if the asymmetry of the forecast
density is not predicted correctly.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Viele Zentralbanken versehen ihre makroökonomischen Prognosen mit Ein-
schätzungen über zukünftige Risiken, wobei ein Risiko eine Asymmetrie der Prog-
nosedichte impliziert. Das heißt, dass das Vorliegen eines Aufwärtsrisikos das
Auftreten von Werten oberhalb der Punktprognose mit einer Wahrscheinlichkeit
von mehr als 50% bedeutet. Entsprechend liegt ein Abwärtsrisiko vor, wenn das
Auftreten von Werten unterhalb der Punktprognose eine Wahrscheinlichkeit von
mehr als 50% besitzt.
In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird geprüft, wie solche makroökonomischen Risiko-
prognosen evaluiert werden können. Ein typisches Problem solcher Evaluatio-
nen ist durch die kleinen Stichprobenumfänge der derzeit verfügbaren Risikoprog-
nosen gegeben. Es zeigt sich zunächst, dass eine Evaluation von Risikoprognosen
nicht auf Grundlage des Standardmaßes für die Asymmetrie einer Wahrschein-
lichkeitsdichte (der Schiefe) erfolgen sollte, da ein alternatives Maß, die Pear-
sonsche Modusschiefe, in kleinen Stichproben eine deutlich genauere Evaluation
ermöglicht.
Viele der in der Praxis auftretenden Probleme bei der Evaluation von Risiko-
prognosen werden untersucht und, soweit möglich, Lösungsvorschläge unterbreitet.
So kann zum Beispiel das Problem beobachtet werden, dass ein bestimmter Test
für die Optimalität von Risikoprognosen zu falschen Ergebnissen führt, falls die
Breite der Prognosedichte, also die Streuung der zukünftigen Prognosefehler sys-
tematisch über- oder unterschätzt wird. Eine Modikation des Tests sorgt jedoch
dafür, dass er wieder korrekte Ergebnisse liefern kann.
Aus den durchgeführten Untersuchungen kann die Schlussfolgerung gezogen
werden, dass von den Optimalitätstests für makroökonomische Risikoprognosen
wegen der derzeit verfügbaren, häug nur kleinen Stichprobenumfänge keine beson-
ders hohe Güte erwartet werden kann. Das bedeutet, dass es nicht unwahrschein-
lich ist, dass keine statistische Evidenz gegen die Optimalität einer Risikoprognose
gefunden wird, selbst wenn diese Optimalität nicht vorliegt, wenn also die Asym-
metrie der Prognosedichte nicht korrekt vorhergesagt wird.

Evaluating Macroeconomic Risk Forecasts1
1 Introduction
Many central banks and other institutions such as the Bank of England or the IMF
complement their macroeconomic forecasts by assessments of risks. In general,
these risk forecasts are related to possible asymmetries of forecast densities, as
described in Knüppel & Schultefrankenfeld (2011). In Figure 1, two examples of
forecast densities implying upside or downside risks to the forecast can be found.2
Both densities are asymmetric, so that mean and mode do not coincide.
As noted by Leeper (2003), it would actually be important to verify whether
macroeconomic risk assessments contain valuable information. Since the forecast
of the central tendency is often a mode forecast3, realizations above [below] the
central tendency should be observed more often in the presence of an upward
[downward] risk. If it turns out that this is not the case, the risk forecasts are not
informative.
In this work, we attempt to identify methods which are suitable for the evalu-

2To be more precise, a risk is usually dened as an important event which, in case of its
occurrence, would lead to a change of the central forecast. For example, the risk of an oil supply
plunge would constitute an upward risk to the in ation forecasts. Of course, there might be
several dierent risks to a forecast. If the upward [downward] risks dominate, it is often said
that the balance of risks is tilted to the upside [downside]. Instead of using the expression
"balance of risks", in this work we simply speak of upward or downward risks.
3This fact might be surprising, but many central banks and other institutions indeed explicitly
state that their published point forecasts refer to the mode of the forecast density or, equivalently,
to the most likely outcome. See Knüppel & Schultefrankenfeld (2011) for a survey.

ation of risk forecasts, focusing on tests for risk forecast optimality. Risk forecasts
can be regarded as point forecasts, because the asymmetry of a density is usually
summarized by a single parameter. While there is a vast literature concerning the
evaluation of point forecasts, we are not aware of any work which focuses on the
specic nature of macroeconomic risk forecast evaluation.
Macroeconomic risk forecast evaluation has to deal with several issues. First, a
choice has to be made concerning the parameter which is supposed to measure the
asymmetry of the density forecast. Also, it has to be considered how the corre-
sponding parameter re ecting the asymmetry of the true forecast density could be
measured. Moreover, evaluations of macroeconomic risk forecasts typically have
to deal with the small sample sizes of risk forecasts. In addition, the risks that are
forecast are usually not very large, either. Finally, many institutions do not quan-
tify the risk, i.e= the asymmetry of the forecast density, but only give the direction
2
of the risk. That is, these institutions state that there is an upward or downward
risk to their forecasts, or that the risks are balanced, but they do not reveal the
magnitude of the forecast risks. Due to small samples and only moderate asym-
metries of the forecast densities, the power of tests for risk forecast optimality can
be expected to be rather low, amplifying the importance of power considerations.
Therefore, this study focuses on a careful analysis of the power properties of these
tests.
In what follows, we are concerned with the partial optimality of forecasts,
where partial optimality is dened as in Diebold & Lopez (1996). As mentioned
by Diebold & Lopez (1996), the original concept of partial optimality refers to
optimality conditional on the information set being used by the forecaster and
goes back to Brown & Maital (1981).4 When we speak of optimality in this study,
we always mean partial optimality with respect to the information set that is given
by the independent variable(s) of a certain regression.
2 How to Measure the Forecast Risk?
In principle, the optimality of quantitative risk forecasts can be investigated in
a similar way as the optimality of conditional mean forecasts. That is, in the
regression
~
u =  + ^
u + %> (1)
where ^
u is the risk forecast and ~
u is the realized risk, the joint null hypothesis
 = 0>  = 1 can be tested. If the risk forecasts are not optimal, the null hypothesis
4Therefore, it would actually seem more plausible to speak of conditional optimality instead
of partial optimality.

should be rejected.
The major question here is how to measure risk. Since, in macroeconomic
forecasting, the balance of risks is related to the skewness of the forecast density,
measures of skewness are natural candidates for the measurement of risk. In what
follows, we consider the third standardized moment (henceforth standard skew-
ness) and the Pearson mode skewness of the density forecast. While the standard
skewness measure is more familiar to statisticians, the Pearson mode skewness
is more directly related to many macroeconomic forecasts by institutions which
quantify risks in terms of the mean-mode dierence. Interestingly, as described in
Knüppel & Schultefrankenfeld (2011), these institution mostly focus on the mode
as measure of the central tendency of their forecasts. Both measures of skewness
are standardized. This is an advantage if the volatility of the forecast variable
changes over time, or if the risk forecasts for dierent variables or dierent fore-
cast horizons are to be analyzed simultaneously, for example in a panel study.
Suppose that the parameters of the forecast density are known. Denote the
expectation of the variable of interest by  and the corresponding mode by p=

Both measures of realized risk depend on a location parameter, just as the usual
measure of the realized forecast error which would be given by (| ). In addition,
both measures depend on the standard deviation of the forecast variable.
A choice of the risk measure to be employed might be based on the power prop-
erties of tests for the optimality of risk forecasts in small samples. We attempt to
nd out which risk measure implies a larger power of the tests. To this end, we
conduct a Monte Carlo study using the two-piece normal distribution (henceforth
tpn distribution) as described, among others, by Wallis (2004). We use this type
of distribution because it is employed by several institutions which publish macro-
economic risk forecasts, like the Bank of England or the International Monetary

The null hypotheses for optimal forecasts are given by

asymptotically. The expected values of ~

The power curves of the optimality tests are plotted in Figure 2.8 Obviously,
the optimality test based on standard skewness performs extremely badly for small
sample sizes. The power curve for Q = 20 is essentially at, equalling about 0.15
for all values of  considered. For Q = 40 and Q = 100> the curves are downward
sloping also in the range 2    4. Even for Q = 1000, the test appears to
reject slightly more often at  = 2=25 than at  = 2 and only reaches a rejection
probability of about 40% for  = 4. Only for Q = 5000 the test seems to be

unbiased, although this conclusion might change if a ner grid for  was used.
In contrast to that, the optimality test based on the Pearson mode skewness
works reasonably well in small samples. For Q = 20, its power is not very large,
reaching up to about 60% if the density is standard normal, i.e= if  = 1. However,
its size is close to 5%, although %!>l is not normally distributed. For Q = 40, the
power at  = 1 increases to about 90%, and for Q = 100 to 100%. In both cases
the test has approximately the correct size. For Q = 1000 and Q = 5000> the
power is large for all  6= 2 considered and the empirical size is close to 5%.
These results show that tests for the optimality of risk forecasts based on the
standard skewness are not useful in small samples. Optimality tests based on the
Pearson mode skewness, however, seem to yield fairly satisfactory results even in
small samples. In what follows, skewness will refer to the Pearson mode skewness,
not to the standard measure of skewness based on third moments.
3 Testing the Optimality of Macroeconomic Risk
Forecasts in Practice
The examples given above show that the Pearson mode skewness is a more promis-
ing measure of asymmetry than the standard skewness if risk forecast optimality is
to be tested. However, the examples in the previous section are highly stylized for
several reasons. For example,  and hence the value of the Pearson mode skewness
^
! does not vary within the sample. Moreover, mode and standard deviation are
known to the forecaster. In addition, the risk forecasts are quantitative, whereas in
practice, many institutions only publish the direction of the forecast risk. There-

fore, in what follows we will study the size and power of the optimality tests under
more realistic conditions.
Another problem likely to be encountered in practice is given by the serial
correlation of realized risks at least for forecast horizons larger than one. This
problem can be addressed by using Newey & West (1987) standard errors. As this
approach is well-known, we will not elaborate on this issue.
3.1 Varying Asymmetry
Instead of assuming that the true skewness ! as well as the forecast skewness ^
! are
xed for all l = 1> 2> ===> Q, we will now assume that they are uniformly distributed
over the interval
£
¯
!> ¯
!
¤
. Given a tpn-distribution, the largest possible value for
¯
! equals 1=32=9 However, such a large value is rather unlikely to be encountered
in practice, since it would imply a folded normal distribution, meaning that the
realization is going to be larger than the mode with certainty. The absolute values
for ^
! found in the sample of risk forecasts by central banks studied in Knüppel
& Schultefrankenfeld (2011) do not exceed 0=5. Moreover, the number of non-zero
risk forecasts in that sample hardly exceeds 30 per forecast horizon, so that we
will focus on samples of that size.
In the following Monte Carlo simulations, we consider two cases. In the rst
case, the true risks !l
are independent of the risk forecasts ^
!l
, so that the risk
forecasts have no information content. In the second case, the risk forecasts are
optimal, i.e. !l
= ^
!l
holds. For both cases, we simulate Q tpn-distributed vari-

We test the hypotheses of no information content ( = 0) and of optimal risk
forecasts ( = 1) at a level of signicance of 5% and for various values of Q, but
focusing on Q = 30. We do so for ve distinct values of ¯
!> ranging from 0=25
to 1=32. The rejection probabilities, based on 10,000 simulations12, are displayed
in Table 2. Apparently, the optimality tests have the correct size. Their power,
however, can be quite low if the largest possible value of the true and the forecast
risks is low. When Q = 30, with ^
!l
coming from the interval [ 0=25> 0=25]> (and in
the case  = 0 with !l
coming from the same interval,) the wrong null is rejected
only in 12% of all simulations. In case that ¯
! equals 0.5, this number increases
to slightly more than 30%. Only if the interval includes more extreme values of

almost 100% if the forecasts are optimal and ¯

needs about 200 observations to reach a comparable power.
3.2 Unknown Mode and Standard Deviation
In practice, additional complications arise from the fact that the mode p as well
the standard deviation  of the forecast density are potentially time-varying and
unknown. Therefore pl and l have to be predicted themselves. So a risk forecast
actually consists of three elements: the forecast mode, the dierence between the
forecast mean and forecast mode, and the forecast standard deviation.
So the question arises how problems with forecasting the mode or the standard
deviation aect the results of tests for risk forecast optimality. Suppose, for exam-
ple, that the forecaster optimally forecasts the dierence between the mode and
the mean as well as the standard deviation, but the mode forecasts are biased. If,
13
in this case, a test for risk forecast optimality would reject the null of optimality
due to the biased mode forecast, its result would be misleading.
Denote the mode forecast by ^
pl, the mean forecast by ^
l
and the standard
deviation forecast by ^
l. The equation used in order to test for risk forecast
optimality is then given by

.
Given these results, a careful analysis of risk forecasts should rstly check for
bias in the forecasts of mode and standard deviation. Unfortunately, without
further assumptions it is unfeasible to evaluate the bias of mode forecasts. One
15
might assume that the risks are balanced on average, so that H

= 0 holds,
implying H [l
] = H [pl
]. In this case, one could test for the bias of mode forecasts
in the same way as for the bias of mean forecasts.14 If one is unwilling to make the
assumption of balanced risks on average, one might just focus on the bias of the
standard deviation and concentrate on tests of hypotheses about .15 Of course,
a potential bias of the risk forecasts given by  6= 0 will remain undetected in this
case.
If the forecasts of mode and standard deviation are unbiased, the main dier-
ence with respect to the results of the Monte Carlo simulations conducted above is
mostly a loss of power. Results of Monte Carlo simulations where mode and stan-
dard deviation are unknown are presented in Table 3. The parameter ¯
x denotes
the limits of the interval ( ¯
x
> ¯
x
) of the uniform distribution from which x is
drawn. xp is drawn from a normal distribution. The true standard deviation is
given by l
= 1 and the true mode by pl
= 0. Moreover, as in most simulations
above, Q = 30 and ¯
! = 0=5.
The results conrm the considerations from above. Tests about  can suer
14If the standard deviation can vary, one would need the additional assumption that (l

the latter equation that is employed. This approach could be justied if l hardly varies or
if heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors are used. In any case, it does not seem too
problematic to use the regression |l
pl
=  + %l as well for testing the bias of mode forecasts
in case of balanced risks.
15Another possible but even more restrictive assumption would be given by the constancy of
the mode, i.e. by p = pl. In this case, kernel density estimation would be needed to estimate
p.

3.3 Direction-of-Risk Forecasts
If risk forecasts are only qualitative, i.e. only the direction of the risk is forecast
but not its magnitude, it is nevertheless possible to conduct tests for forecast
optimality. In this case, the realized and the forecast risks are categorical variables.
Even if the risk forecasts are quantitative, a transformation of quantitative risks
(interval variables) to qualitative risks (categorical variables) might be interesting
if the focus rather lies on the direction of the risks.
Actually, in the case of qualitative risk forecasts, there are only two possible
outcomes: success (direction of forecast risk equals direction of realized risk) and
failure (direction of forecast risk diers from direction of realized risk). Therefore,
one could use tests based on the binomial distribution. However, in empirical
applications one is most likely going to be confronted with the problem of serial

 on average equals 0=77, diering slightly from the value 0=70 implied by equation
(9), because the latter result is based on an approximation.
17
correlation. This problem can be addressed more easily if the categorical variables
are analyzed in a regression context.17
Recode the realized and forecast risks according to

A

Then tests for forecast optimality can be based on the regression
~
$l
=  + $
^
$l
+ %$>l
= (12)
Obviously, if the risk forecasts have no information content, $
equals zero. If the
risk forecasts are optimal, $
is larger than zero but, in contrast to > it is not
equal to one in general. This is due to the fact that, even if the forecast density
is strongly skewed, there is still a positive probability mass on each side of the
mode.18 However, necessary (though not su!cient) conditions for risk forecast
optimality could be tested using one-sided tests. If the risk forecasts are optimal,
the null hypothesis $
 0 should be rejected, whereas the null hypothesis $
 0
should not. Note that optimal forecasts do not imply  = 0=
We use the same Monte Carlo simulation design as for the results in Table 2 in
order to obtain information about the rejection probabilities. That is, we simulate

18Only in the special case of a folded normal distribution, i.e. the case ! = ±

and ^
!l
as in Section 3.1, and we construct the variables ~
$l and ^
$l according
to equations (10) and (11). Then we estimate equation (12) and test hypotheses
about $
. The results are displayed in Table 4. Here, the sample size Q always
equals 30, and the nominal size of the tests is again 5%.
If the risk forecasts have no information content, $
equals zero and the null
hypotheses about $
($
= 0, $
 0, $
 0) have the correct size. If the
risk forecasts are optimal, $
is positive, but can be close to zero if ¯
! is small.
Consequently, the null hypothesis $
= 0 can hardly be rejected if ¯
! is small. The
power of the test only marginally exceeds its nominal size if ¯
! = 0=25.
The results show that it is preferable to conduct tests for risk forecast optimality
based on quantitative risk forecasts if available. For example, according to Table 2
the power of the test for  = 0 if  = 1 is 33% if ¯
! = 0=5= This is considerably larger
than the 13% attained with qualitative risk forecasts and the test for $
= 0.
If  = 1, the one-sided test for $
 0 of course rejects more often than the
test for $
= 0, but its power is not very large either. For example, it rejects in
22% of the simulations if ¯
! = 0=5. Given  = 1, the one-sided test for $
 0
hardly ever rejects even if ¯
! is small.
The 95% condence intervals for the estimate of $
interestingly include neg-
ative values unless ¯
! is very large. This implies that, even if the risk forecasts are
optimal, it is not unlikely to observe more failures than successes of the qualitative
risk forecasts in small samples.
One might expect that the fact that mode and standard deviation are unknown
further reduces the power of the tests if qualitative risk forecasts are analyzed.
This, however, is not always the case. If the realized risks are transformed to

in the case of categorical variables, only the sign of (|l

l matters. This
sign does obviously not depend on the forecast of ^

can aect the size and the power of the tests for forecast optimality.

forecasts are analyzed.20
3.4 An Alternative Test for Risk Forecast Optimality?
One might think that an alternative way of testing the optimality of risk forecasts
would be given by using a standard test for mean forecast optimality, i.e. testing
the null hypothesis  = 0 and  = 1 in the regression |l
= +^
l
+%l, where %l is
an error term. This alternative test could work, because, if the null hypothesis is
true, this implies that (|l
pl
) @l
= (^
l
pl
) @l
+ %l
@l holds, independently
of the properties of the forecasts ^
pl and ^
l. So this test might seem preferable if
one wants to circumvent problems arising from forecasting pl and l
= However,
20In the most extreme case, dp can deviate so strongly from zero that the dependent variable
becomes a constant, because one would always observe a downward risk if dp is very large or an
upward risk if dp is very small.
21
it turns out that strong deviations from risk forecast optimality can easily remain
undetected by standard tests of forecast optimality.
Consider the following case: Suppose that ^
pl
= pl and that ^
l
= l. Suppose
further that the risk forecasts are given by ^
l
^
pl
=  (l
pl
). So if  A 1, the
magnitude of risk is overestimated, whereas if 0   ? 1, the magnitude of risk is
underestimated. This implies that the mean forecast, given by ^
l
= ^
pl
+(^
l
^
pl
),
equals
^
l
= ^
pl
+  (l
pl
) = (1 ) pl
+ l
=
For the sake of simplicity, also assume that H [pl
] = H [l
] = 0. The condition
H [pl
] = H [l
] implies that the (unscaled) risks are balanced on average.
Even if  strongly diers from 1, i.e if the risk forecasts are strongly non-
optimal, it might be very di!cult to detect that ^
l
6= l
. Firstly, since H [pl
] =
H [l
] holds, H [^
l
] = H [l
] holds as well. Secondly, the correlation between
^
l
and l
can be very large even if  strongly diers from 1. Assuming that
Fry [pl

ied in Knüppel & Schultefrankenfeld (2011).22 The variance of the unscaled risk
forecasts, i.e. of the mean-mode dierence equals 0=0022, whereas the variance of
the mode forecasts equals 0=4704. Assuming that these values are good estimates
of the true variances of mode and unscaled risk, the variance of the mode is more
than 200 times larger than the variance of the unscaled risk. Even if the risk
forecasts contain no information, so that  = 0, the correlation between between

number of observations to obtain an acceptable power of the test. With Q = 30,
the power of the test is virtually identical to its size.23
4 Conclusion
In this work, we have investigated several issues arising when evaluating macroeco-
nomic risk forecasts, focusing on tests for the optimality of these forecasts. Such
tests are confronted with the problems of small samples, at best moderate risks
(i.e. asymmetries) and potentially only categorical instead of quantitative risk
forecasts. Although all simulation results presented rest on certain assumptions
like the tpn-distribution of the densities and the uniform distribution for the risks,
they nevertheless clearly show that one should not expect too much power of the
optimality tests for risk forecasts. However, they also give guidance in order for
the tests to have the correct size and as much power as possible under the given
circumstances.
22For these nowcasts, the assumption ^
pl
= pl might be a good approximation to the more
realistic relation ^
pl
= pl
+ xp>l, because the variance of the mode forecasts is much larger than
the variance of the forecast density. The latter can be thought of as a proxy for H
£
x2
p>l
¤
.
23Results of Monte Carlo simulations are available on request.
23
We nd that the asymmetry of the risk forecasts should not be measured by the
standard coe!cient of skewness, because the power of the test would be extremely
low in this case. Instead, the Pearson mode skewness is preferable yielding much
larger power in small samples. The asymmetry of the true density then has to
be measured using the forecasts of mode and standard deviation. This can cause
problems in terms of power loss if these forecasts are imprecise and in terms of
size distortions if these forecasts are biased.
In order to evaluate the bias of the mode forecasts, potentially problematic
assumptions are required. If these assumptions are to be avoided, tests for risk
forecast optimality can still be conducted if the null hypothesis of the test is modi-
ed. That is, from the composite null hypothesis about the constant and the slope
parameter, one can exclude the hypothesis about the constant and concentrate
on the slope parameter only, because the estimate of the slope parameter remains
unaected by a potential bias of the mode forecasts.
If the risk forecasts are available on a categorical basis only, the tests suer
from a further loss in power. However, they are not aected by the potential
impreciseness of the forecast standard deviation.
Considering the relation of standard tests for mean forecast optimality and risk
forecast optimality, one might think that the results of these standard tests contain
information about risk forecast optimality. While this is true in principle, we nd
that in practice the results of these standard tests should not be interpreted in
terms of risk forecast optimality.
In order to tackle the problem of potentially low power, risk forecasts could pos-
sibly better be evaluated in a panel setup. This may be feasible if the risk forecasts
for a certain variable are, for example, available for several forecast horizons.
