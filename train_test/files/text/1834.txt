[1] We have developed a data set of changes in population and agricultural land for the
conterminous United States at the county level, resulting in more spatial detail than in
previously available compilations. The purpose was to provide data on the timing of land
conversion as an input to dynamic models of the carbon cycle, although a wide variety of
applications exist for the physical, biological, and social sciences. The spatial data
represent the appropriate county boundaries for each census year between 1790 and 1997,
and the census attributes are attached to the appropriate spatial region. The resulting time
series and maps show the history of population (1790­1990) and the history of
agricultural development (1850­1997). The patterns of agricultural development reflect
the influences of climate, soil productivity, increases in population size, variations in the
general economy, and technological changes in the energy, transportation, and
agricultural sectors. INDEX TERMS: 1615 Global Change: Biogeochemical processes (4805); 1699

1. Introduction
[2] The conversion of forests and grasslands for agricul-
tural uses has stimulated the release of carbon from soils to
the atmosphere. Subsequent abandonment of cropland,
allowing it to revert to forest or grassland, may enhance
the sequestration of carbon in the soil. A detailed under-
standing of the effects of land conversion on carbon
sequestration is needed to understand the historical pattern
of human influences on the global carbon cycle. A more
complete understanding of the global carbon budget, based
on an understanding of the physical, biological, and human
processes that are involved, is essential for developing
appropriate carbon management strategies and policies.
One way to achieve greater precision is to perform analyses
of land conversion that cover large areas with smaller spatial
units and incorporate data at additional points in time.
[3] The data set presented in this paper shows changes in
population and agricultural land for the conterminous United
States at the county level. Previous compilations were based
on state-level data and have less spatial detail. There have
been many changes in county boundaries through time, and
we attached census statistics to the appropriate county
boundaries for each census year. We focused on data for
population and area of cropland because they are most
relevant to our study of the impact of land conversion on
the carbon cycle. The land-use patterns reflected in these
data should be useful to physical and biological scientists.
The database linkages may be useful to social scientists who
are interested in attaching additional socioeconomic data
from the census to the spatial framework.
[4] A disturbance of the soil such as plowing, breaks up
the original soil structure, exposes the soil to oxygen, and
causes a decrease in the organic carbon content of the soil.
Decreases of 20 to 40% of the soil organic carbon may
occur following cultivation, with most of the decrease
occurring in the first 20 years [Davidson and Ackerman,
1993; Harden et al., 1999]. The rapid decreases in soil
carbon were most likely due to poor agricultural practices
that did not maintain soil fertility and did not prevent
erosion. When the consequences of poor agricultural prac-
tices became evident, farmers began to retain plant residue,
use fertilizers, and prevent erosion. In some areas, these
improved practices have maintained the inputs from net
primary production at high enough levels to allow some
recovery of soil carbon on agricultural lands. A complete
model of the impacts of land conversion on soil carbon will
require information from field studies of historical trends of
soil organic carbon.

[5] To get a full understanding of the influence of these
changes on levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, it is also
necessary to have an understanding of the spatial extent of
the land in cropland. The data set presented here provides a
new level of spatial detail for the history of agricultural land
use in the conterminous United States. Taken together, the
field-based process studies that give site-specific histories of
the amounts of soil carbon and the spatial databases that
show the timing of conversion to cropland will allow
detailed modeling of the influences of land-use change on
atmospheric CO2
. This will contribute to the requirement
identified by the National Research Council Committee on
Global Change Research [1999], which stated, ``An histor-
ical record from the beginning of the industrial era is needed
to assess the effects of land-use change on climate and the
carbon cycle.''
[6] Recent estimates of the global carbon budget show
that terrestrial ecosystems appear to have been a net source
of CO2
to the atmosphere during the period from 1850 to
1998. Approximately 270 (±30) Pg C was released to the
atmosphere from fossil fuel burning and cement production,
and 136 (±55) Pg C was released from land-use change,
primarily deforestation. The atmosphere retained 176 (±10)
Pg C, which is about 43% of total emissions. The 230 (±60)
Pg C removed from the atmosphere is estimated to be
evenly split between the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems
[Watson et al., 2000]. Over the period, terrestrial systems
released approximately 21 Pg C (= 136­230/2) more than
they absorbed.
[7] Several databases have been developed that are useful
for analyzing relationships between land-cover change and
the global carbon cycle. Previous work in constructing land-
use histories for global change studies [Houghton and
Hackler, 2000b; Ramankutty and Foley, 1999; Klein Gold-
ewijk, 2001] have used state-level data sources. The county-
level data set presented in this paper provides a capability for
more detailed analysis than is possible using state-level data.
[8] Houghton and Hackler [2000a] estimated carbon
stocks and fluxes, including analysis of cropland change,
for nine continental-scale regions. Houghton and Hackler
[2000b] have also used a cohort model to evaluate carbon
uptake and release from agriculture and forestry in the
conterminous United States. The model calculated the total
flux between 1700 and 1990 as a release of 32.6 Pg C, of
which they attributed 29 Pg C to a decrease in the area of
forests and woodlands. Their analysis of CO2
fluxes due to
land-use change was sensitive to the level of spatial dis-
aggregation, and they were more confident in their results
when they used seven regions rather than considering the
entire United States as one region. They concluded that
knowing the spatial distribution of historical land-use
change is important for extrapolating the results of site-
specific CO2
measurements to larger regions.
[9] Ramankutty and Foley [1999] reconstructed a crop-
land history of the world from 1700 to 1992, creating a data
set with a spatial resolution of 5 min of latitude and
longitude. They also modeled areas of grasslands and
abandoned lands. For the United States portion, they used
state-level census data on improved farmland and cropland
starting in 1850. They used a 1992 land-cover classification
derived from remotely sensed sources, as well as a data set
of potential vegetation to represent conditions prior to
human settlement. They used a simple land-cover change
model to extrapolate backwards from the 1992 land cover to
the potential vegetation, constrained by the historical crop
data for each political unit. For the United States, they made
adjustments for the change in definition between plowable
pasture and cropland used for pasture by applying ratios
computed from data in the 1940s back through time to
1850. The effect was to develop a smoothed time series with
a definition of total cropland that included a component for
``cropland used for pasture,'' rather than the more broadly
defined ``plowable pasture'' category.
[10] The History Database of the Global Environment
(HYDE, version 2.0) includes historical cropland maps,
represented on a grid with a resolution of 0.5° longitude
and latitude [Klein Goldewijk, 2001]. The maps were
formed by allocating national and subnational cropland
and pastureland statistics to the grid using global data sets
of historical population and land cover. The methods use
different data sets for current and historical land cover than
used by Ramankutty and Foley [1999], and the allocation
from political units to grid cells is based on population
rather than land cover. For the United States portion, the
state-level historical cropland statistics were obtained by
personal communication from Ramankutty. Klein Goldewijk
[2001] recognized some of the limitations of using popula-
tion data as a basis for allocating land-use statistics from
political units onto a uniform grid and concluded with a
comment that the scientific community ``could clearly
benefit from the translation of more historical statistical
information into a digital (spatial) format.''
[11] The work reported in this paper was undertaken as a
part of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Mississippi
Basin Carbon Project (MBCP). The focus of the MBCP is
to investigate the impacts of erosion and sedimentation on
the balance between carbon in the soil and in the atmos-
phere [Sundquist et al., 1998; Stallard, 1998]. At a local site
and in a specific time period, carbon sequestration occurs if
there is a net storage of atmospheric carbon in the ecosys-
tem, particularly the soil. Conversely, changes in land
management may cause a release of soil carbon to the
atmosphere. The carbon transfers are often in the form of
carbon dioxide or methane, which are greenhouse gases,
and thus relevant to the analysis of factors contributing to
global climate change. Measurements and modeling being
conducted in MBCP studies address the hypothesis that part
of this reduction may be due to a direct transfer of CO2
to
the atmosphere as the soil carbon is oxidized by microbial
processes, and another part may be moved by erosion and
redeposited lower on the landscape. The environment in
depositional areas may result in a lower rate of microbial
respiration than would have occurred in the undisturbed
ecosystem, so that the release rates to the atmosphere are not
as large as would have occurred if erosion and deposition
were ignored. If the hypothesis is correct, then previous
estimates may have overestimated the contribution of land-
use change to the buildup of carbon in the atmosphere.
[12] Carbon sequestration and release can only be calcu-
lated for defined periods in time. An adequate understand-
84 - 2 WAISANEN AND BLISS: AGRICULTURAL LAND CHANGE
ing of the processes requires a historical view, in which a
sequence of time periods is evaluated [Sundquist, 1993]. To
evaluate the timing of land conversion into agriculture, we
have brought together the census data and the related
county-boundary data. Additional processing of the time
series presented here will be needed to construct interpola-
tions and extrapolations into more detailed categories of
land disturbance. We will use the timing of land-use con-
versions as input to a model of ecosystem carbon dynamics
that is able to account for erosion and deposition. The model
is able to replicate the decline or recovery of soil carbon
with land-use change and account for the impacts of soil
erosion and deposition on the simulated carbon content of
soil through time [S. Liu, personal communication, 2001].
The data on the timing of land conversion will contribute to
modeling historic erosion rates; these erosion rates and land-
use change can then be used as inputs to modeling historical
carbon cycling.
[13] In the conterminous United States, a census of
population has been taken every 10 years since 1790, and
information on agricultural land use has been collected
since 1850 at 10-year or 5-year intervals. The census
statistics have been published for each county for these
time periods. A county is a subdivision of a state, and the
states subdivide the country. Land areas that were annexed
often became territories before becoming states. The terri-
tory, state, and county boundaries changed through time as
the country expanded and developed. Boundary changes
were frequent in the early years, with shifts, mergers, and
splits, but the boundaries became more stable about 1920.
The mean area of a county in 1997 was 2534 km2 and the
median area was 1609 km2, with counties east of the 100th
meridian typically being smaller than those to the west. We
have obtained digital data for the historical county bounda-
ries and for the census attributes related to agricultural land
areas. The data were edited for consistency with original
sources, spatial data were linked to tabular data, and
integrated data sets and maps were produced, resulting in
a spatial-temporal database.
2. Data Sources
2.1. Spatial Data Sources
2.1.1. Louisiana State University Historic County
Boundary Files
[14] Data on historic county boundaries were purchased
from Louisiana State University (LSU) [Earle and Cao,
1991; Earle and Heppen, 1996] and loaded into a geo-
graphic information system. The level of accuracy was
described as being ``excellent at the national level and good
at the regional level.'' The LSU boundaries were used with
census data for the years 1790­1930.
2.1.2. USGS County Boundary File
[15] A USGS county boundary data set (CTY2M here-
after) was used with census data from 1940 to 1997
[National Atlas, 1994]. The 1:2,000,000-scale USGS
source was used in preference to the 1:100,000-scale
USGS data set because it included a better definition of
coastlines. The data include the Federal Information Pro-
cessing Standards (FIPS) code, a five-digit state and
county code that was first assigned in 1972. A FIPS code
consists of a numeric state code (two digits) and county
code (three digits).
2.2. Tabular Data Sources
2.2.1. ICPSR Data
[16] Data for the decades 1790 through 1960 were pur-
chased from the Inter-university Consortium for Political
and Social Research (ICPSR) [1999]. The county-level
decadal data used from this source were as follows:
1790­1960, population by county; 1850­1930, numerous
categories of agricultural area by county.
[17] This data set did not include population or agricul-
tural area counts for areas that had not achieved statehood
by the given census date, such as territories and Indian
reservations. We coded these numbers when they were
published by the census as tables, text, or footnotes.
2.2.2. Economic Research Service
[18] A data set with county agricultural land area for
1949, 1954, 1959, 1964, 1969, and 1974 was purchased
from the National Archives [Economic Research Service,
1999].
2.2.3. Census of Agriculture and National Agriculture
Statistical Service
[19] A time series with data for the years 1978, 1982,
1987, 1992, and 1997 is available digitally on CD-ROM.
For the years 1978 to 1992, the data were published by the
Bureau of the Census [U.S. Census, 1991, 1995, 1999], and
starting in 1997 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA) [1999].
Data for the previous years in the time series are often
included in the later releases. Because corrections may be
included, we used the most recent source possible in
preference to the original year of publication.
2.2.4. Other
[20] Digital data were not available for the years 1925,
1935, 1940, and 1945. We keyed several categories of
cropland data for 1940 and 1945 from census volumes
[U.S. Census, 1946]. We keyed three pasture variables for
1930 [U.S. Census, 1932a]. Population data for 1970, 1980,
and 1990 were extracted from a commercial source [Geo-
Lytics, Inc., 1999].
3. Methods
3.1. Spatial Data
3.1.1. Editing the LSU Data
[21] The data were processed using the Arc/Info geo-
graphic information system software [ESRI, 2000]. We
developed a routine in the Arc/Edit subsystem that made
it possible to load the LSU files into Arc/Info. For each
decade, the files of county-level data for each state were
joined into a single spatial data set for the conterminous
United States. Boundary discrepancies, such as overlaps and
undershoots, were eliminated by selecting a single arc to
represent the boundary. For the decades 1790 through 1840,
boundary discrepancies of less than 5 km2 were resolved.
With the addition of the larger counties in the west after
1840, discrepancies of less than 49 km2 were resolved. Tests
were run for label errors and topology errors, such as
unclosed polygons.
WAISANEN AND BLISS: AGRICULTURAL LAND CHANGE 84 - 3
[22] The LSU files contain state and county names. The
county names are not unique. For instance, in 1880, 30
states had a county named Washington. A unique identifier
was formed with the state abbreviation and county name
fields appended together, all uppercase (for example,
ALWASHINGTON, ARWASHINGTON).
3.1.2. Editing the Modern County Boundary Data
[23] Most of the county boundary changes occurred
before 1930, but a few counties dissolved, split, or changed
after that date. The FIPS code was used as the primary
identifier for relating the spatial data to the census data.
Details of changes between 1949 and 1997 are given in
Appendix A.
3.1.3. Other Issues
[24] The census data for Virginia cities and Washington,
D. C. are sometimes lumped into the surrounding counties.
The appropriate edits were made to the LSU and CTY2M
data sets for each decade or 5-year interval.
[25] There can be multiple spatial polygons for each
county, often owing to islands. For each time period, geo-
graphic information system tools were used to build a new
relational table, called a region table, with only one record
per county. The census data were attached to the region
table. For making maps, the population or farmland was
assumed to be uniformly distributed across a county.
3.2. Tabular Data
[26] Population and agricultural data from the three sour-
ces were extracted from the source files and loaded into
Arc/Info. State abbreviations were appended to county
names to make a unique identifier for matching with the
spatial data.
3.2.1. ICPSR Data
[27] The ICPSR data set sometimes used compound
historical names, such as Orange/Mosquito County in
Florida, which was simply Orange County in the census
volumes. A new data field was defined to contain the name
of the county as given in the original census volumes.
3.2.2. Economic Research Service
[28] The Economic Research Service data were in a single
file for the intervals from 1949 to 1974 [Economic Research
Service, 1999]. The data were extracted and loaded into
Arc/Info using an array structure. In a data recovery at the
National Archives, 225 records had been lost. Comparison
with the ICPSR agricultural data showed that only data for
Clarke County, Alabama (FIPS code 01025), were missing,
and we keyed these data from original census volumes [U.S.
Census, 1952, 1956, 1960a, 1965, 1972, 1975].
3.2.3. Census of Agriculture
[29] Data for 1978 and 1982 were extracted from a
Census of Agriculture CD-ROM [U.S. Census, 1991]. This
CD-ROM contained preliminary data for 1987, which we
did not use. Data for 1987, 1992, and 1997 were extracted
from a National Agricultural Statistics Service CD-ROM
[USDA, 1999]. In some cases, county data were not pub-
lished if they would have disclosed information on the
operations of an individual farm.
3.2.4. Definitional Changes
[30] Up through 1920, the ``improved land in farms''
category defined a consistent time series. In 1925 and later
years, the term improved land in farms was no longer used
and the term ``cropland'' was introduced. The category
``total cropland'' included the subcategories of harvested
cropland, crop failure, idle cropland, cropland in summer
fallow, and plowable pasture. We use the term ``improved
farmland'' to refer to the combined time series of improved
land in farms and total cropland.
[31] The term plowable pasture was used through 1940,
and then the term ``cropland used for pasture'' was used. A
footnote to a table for the 1945 census [U.S. Census, 1947]
describes the change: ``The 1940 figures are not strictly
comparable with those for 1945. The 1945 figures include
land used only for pasture, which has been plowed within 7
years. The 1940 figures include land pastured, which could
have been plowed and used for crops without additional
clearing, drainage, or irrigation. This land may not have
been plowed within 7 years prior to 1940.''
[32] A recent report from the Economic Research Service
[USDA, 2000] notes, ``Cropland pasture and permanent
grassland pasture have not always been clearly distin-
guished in agricultural surveys.'' Differences in definitions
used by the census over time and geographic boundary
changes that may influence the interpretation of the maps
are given in Appendix B. Many of the details of boundary
changes were based on the descriptions by Thorndale and
Dollarhide [1997].
3.3. Matching Tabular Data and Maps
[33] The tabular data from census sources were matched
with the spatial data using the common identifier, consisting
of the state abbreviation and county name in the earlier years,
or the FIPS code in the later years. Fields for the common
identifier were added to both the census and the spatial
sources. There were often discrepancies in the county names
between the spatial and tabular data sources, requiring us to
develop iterative procedures to match the data sets with each
other. Discrepancies were resolved by using the names in the
original census documents. Problems in the matching proc-
ess sometimes identified the need for additions or deletions
of boundary lines in the spatial data.
[34] The LSU delineations were used for the decades
1790­1930. The population data for 1940 and 1950 were
also linked to the LSU spatial data. The agricultural data for
1940 to the present and population data for 1960 to the
present were linked to the CTY2M spatial data using the
FIPS code.
[35] The printed census volumes were considered the
primary authority for tabular data. The primary authority
for many edits to the spatial data was the map guide to the
federal censuses, 1790­1920 [Thorndale and Dollarhide,
1997].
[36] The match of the spatial data to the tabular data was
tested from both directions. When records did not match,
some problems were identified beyond issues of spelling.
Census data sets sometimes include separate statistics for
independent cities, such as Virginia cities, Washington,
D. C., and Baltimore. When separate data for cities were
present in the census data, delineations for the cities were
included in the spatial data for that decade. If separate data
for cities were not provided because the counts were
84 - 4 WAISANEN AND BLISS: AGRICULTURAL LAND CHANGE
included with the surrounding counties, the city boundaries
were deleted.
[37] After the iterative matching process was completed,
the census data were joined to the region table. Census
enumerations that were reported in acres were converted to
square meters. Ratios of the area of each land-use type, such
as ``improved land in farms'' or ``harvested cropland,'' and
population densities were calculated by dividing by the total
area of a county. Although some census records provided a
total area for a county, the area computed by the geographic
information system was used as the basis for deriving ratios.
[38] Population and agricultural land density maps were
created for each variable for each census date to provide a
visual check on the matching process and the census
numbers. Anomalies were traced and previous steps
repeated as needed. If the land in farms for a county
exceeded 120% of the county area, the boundary delinea-
tions were verified and re-digitized. If a discrepancy was not
caused by digitizing, the acreage was verified.
[39] Farms on the edges of counties frequently overlap
with one or more other counties. The Bureau of the Census
counted all the acres of a farm or ranch in the county of its
headquarters. In most areas of the country, the undercounts
and overcounts recorded for a given county were most
likely equivalent. However, there were extreme cases in
which the area in farms exceeded the area of the county. A
noticeable example occurs in Texas, where starting in 1900
there are more than 20 counties with large ranches that
extend into adjacent counties. This condition also occurs in
Grant County, Nebraska, starting in 1920. This agriculture
and population database has not been tested for ``under-
counts,'' which could only be done by proof-reading the
data purchased from three sources. Blanks and zeros that
seemed anomalous were verified with the census volumes.
4. Results
[40] The trend for population over time is given in Table 1
and mapped in Figure 1. Population has increased over the
period of the study, with 10-year rates of increase of
approximately 35% between 1790 and 1860, rates between
20 and 30% from 1860 to 1910, and rates between 7 and
19% from 1910 to 1990. The uses of land in the contermi-
nous United States are shown in Figure 2. Only some of the
data shown in Figure 2 are from the county-level time
series; other data are from national summaries. The time
series of total land in farms in Figure 2 shows a peak in
1949, followed by a decline. The total area in farmland may
be sensitive to definitional changes relating to the inclusion
of woodlands and rangeland. Specifically, federal land that
is used for grazing by a permit is included in non-farm
grazing land, and federal land that is under the control of an
operator through a lease is included in ``other pasture,'' a
part of ``land in farms'' [U.S. Census, 1943b].
[41] An indication of disturbance due to plowing, grazing,
clearing, and other activities is provided by the record of
improved farmland, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, as well
as the sets of maps in Figures 3 and 4 and the regional analysis

In Figure 4, the data are also at the county level, but county

(for 1920 and before) or total cropland (for years 1925 and

4.1. Verification of the Time Series
[42] Additional census volumes were used to verify
individual entries where there were apparent discrepancies
[U.S. Census, 1791, 1802, 1811, 1821, 1832, 1841, 1853,
1854, 1864a, 1864b, 1872a, 1872b, 1872c, 1883, 1891,
1894a, 1894b, 1895, 1896, 1901, 1902, 1910, 1913a,
1913b, 1913c, 1913d, 1922, 1923, 1927, 1931, 1932a,
1932b, 1932c, 1932d, 1932e, 1936, 1942, 1943a, 1943b,
1946, 1952, 1956, 1960a, 1960b, 1965, 1972, 1973, 1975,
1981a, 1989d, 1996].
[43] The population, farmland, improved farmland, and
cropland national totals summed from the spatial data set
were compared with the published totals from the United
States Census, and representative results are shown in
Table 1. For census years between 1850 and 1920, the
totals were compared with the totals given by Dodd [1993]
for areas of improved farmland. The areas of total farm-
land were compared with a census volume [U.S. Census,
1989b] for census years between 1930 and 1969. The
areas of total farmland and cropland were compared with
census summary volumes for census years between 1974
and 1997 [U.S. Census, 1975, 1981b, 1989a, 1999].
During the years since 1978, the area of total cropland
summed from the county data is less than the area reported
in national totals by more than 1%. This difference may be
due to the impact of disclosure rules, in which the census
does not report county values that could identify individual
farm operators. As farms become larger, more counties
may be affected by these disclosure rules.
4.2. Regional Trends
[44] Figure 5 shows the improved farmland or cropland
time series for the conterminous United States and for
three subregions, chosen to capture regional differences
in the timing and intensity of agricultural development.
The subregions were defined for the Northeast, the
Southeast, and the Midwest-Great Plains, as shown in
the inset map in Figure 5. The trend shown in Figures 2
Figure 2. Patterns of land use in the conterminous United States, 1850 to 1997 (cumulative area, km2).
Improved farmland was recorded by the census from 1850 to 1920, and cropland was recorded from 1925
to 1997. Total land in farms has also been recorded since 1850. The categories shown, from bottom to
top, are 1: harvested cropland; 2: crop failure; 3: cropland idle; 4: cropland in cover crops; 5: cropland in
cultivated summer fallow; 6: plowable pasture (1940 and before) or cropland used for pasture (1945 and
after); 7: other pasture; 8: farm woodland pastured; 9: farm woodland not pastured; 10: farm, special uses
and other; 11: non-farm grazing on grassland; 12: non-farm grazing on forest land; 13: non-farm forest
land not used for grazing; and 14: non-farm special uses and other. The line labeled ``improved farmland''
is the cumulation of categories 1 through 6 representing cropland and plowable pasture, and is illustrated
in the maps in Figures 3 and 4. The line labeled ``land in farms'' is the cumulation of the first 10
categories, and ``land area of the conterminous United States'' represents the cumulation of all categories.
Multiple U.S. Census sources were used, and not all data are represented by our county-level time series.
The non-farm values were derived from U.S. Census [1989c] and Economic Research Service [USDA,
2000]. Some values are interpolated or computed by subtraction.

trates an increase in improved farmland and cropland from
1850 to 1940 and then a slight decline through 1997. On a
regional basis, the trend in the Northeast is a stronger
increase until a peak in 1880, and then a stronger decline
than in the other regions. The Southeast has a broad peak
in the period from 1920 to 1940 and then also declines
substantially. The increase in trend in the Midwest and

4.3. Data Availability
[45] A time series for population and the combined time
series for improved land in farms and cropland are available
for download from the EROS Data Center. They have been
spatially interpolated into the modern county boundaries.
Some restrictions may apply to some of the original spatial
and tabular data that would require users to obtain permis-
sions from other sources.
5. Discussion
5.1. Economic and Technological Forces of Change
[46] The patterns of agricultural development and decline
that are reflected in Figures 2­5 are the result of complex
interactions between the capabilities of the land, climate,
population growth and migration, energy sources, trans-
portation, general economic conditions, agricultural tech-
nologies, and agricultural policy.
[47] A useful framework for grouping the driving forces is
provided by Borchert [1967, 1991], who summarized major
epochs as the Sail-Wagon Epoch (1790­1830), the Steam-
boat and Iron Horse Epoch (1830­1870), the Steel Rail
Epoch (1870­1920), the Auto-Air-Cheap Oil Epoch
(1920­1970), and the Satellite-Electronic-Jet Propulsion
Epoch (1970 to the time of writing).
[48] The migration of Europeans into port cities and the
diffusion of agriculture by conversion of Eastern forests to
cropland were dominant in the early years. A forced migra-
tion of slaves from Africa also contributed to population
growth and the expansion of plantation agriculture in the
South. The Appalachian Mountains were generally unsuit-
able for agriculture and represented a physical barrier to
western expansion. The development of canals and inland

waterways from 1810 through 1840 allowed farmlands
developed west of the Appalachians to serve markets in
the East, with steamboats becoming important after 1830
[Meinig, 1993]. Railroads began to surpass waterways for
transport in the 1860s and railroad ton-miles peaked between
1885 and 1920, with a progression of fuels from wood to
anthracite to bituminous coal [Borchert, 1967]. The propor-
tion of improved farmland in the farm-dominated counties of
the Northeast region peaked in 1880 (Figure 5) as the
transportation system allowed the Eastern markets to be
served by agriculture on the better soils of the Ohio Valley
and areas west of the Appalachians [Meyer, 1987]. The
development of tile drainage allowed wetland areas near
the Great Lakes and in Iowa, Minnesota, and the Mississippi
Delta to be cropped [Dahl and Allord, 1996; Prince, 1997].
The proportion of improved farmland in the Midwest and
Great Plains reached a high level in 1910 and remained fairly
steady through its peak in 1940, after which it stabilized with
a slight decline through 1997 (Figure 5). Major droughts
around 1860, 1890, and 1930, as well as pest infestations,
influenced these patterns. The proportion of improved farm-
land or cropland developed more slowly in the Southeast
compared to the nation as a whole, with a peak in 1920 being
repeated in 1940, after which the proportion declined sharply
(Figure 5). The boll weevil had decimated the cotton crop
between 1909 and 1921, and erosion and nutrient with-
drawal had depleted the soils [Hart, 1967]. Many of the
southern croplands were abandoned following the disinte-
gration of the post-bellum sharecropping system, and often
later converted to plantations of trees [Hart, 1968, 1991;
Earle, 1992; Danbom, 1995]. In the 20th century, motorized
tractors, automobiles, rural electricity, and the development
of federal highways influenced farming practices. Improve-
ments in yields resulted from fertilization, pesticides, and
crop genetics, guided by research funded by state and federal
governments through the land grant universities [Edmond,
1978]. The federal government also attempted to stabilize
economic cycles through controls on production linked to
farm subsidies [Schertz et al., 1980; Hallberg, 2001], pro-
vided agricultural agencies [Lewis, 1987], and stimulated the
development of irrigation in the western states [Meyer,
1995]. Some variations in the time series may be due to
other governmental policies, such as international agree-
ments for foreign agricultural trade, embargoes restricting
trade, and the introduction of the Conservation Reserve
Program and Wetland Reserve Program.
5.2. Consistency of the Time Series
[49] Our primary purpose was to assess disturbances on
the landscape that would affect the carbon content of soils.
The most consistent time series from these data are the
connected trends of improved farmland (1850­1920) and
cropland (1925­1997). The patterns of the time series may
be influenced by definition and terminology changes in the
census data. For example, land in the plowable pasture
category may have never been plowed, whereas the ``crop-
land used for pasture'' category implies that plowing had
been previously done. These data cannot be used to con-
sistently identify the portions of these pasture categories that
were actually plowed prior to a given census year.
[50] The definition of a farm has changed nine times since
1850 and, although this can affect whether a particular
Figure 5. Proportion of improved farmland or cropland, 1850 to 1997, for the conterminous United
States and three subregions.
84 - 12 WAISANEN AND BLISS: AGRICULTURAL LAND CHANGE
cropland parcel is counted, in most cases this most likely has
only a small influence on the national results. For example,
starting in 1978, the threshold for defining a farm increased
to $1000 of farm products sold. Prior to 1978, a farm was
defined as ``any place with less than ten acres from which
$250 or more of agricultural products were sold or normally
would have been sold during the census year, or any place of
ten acres or more from which $50 or more of agricultural
products were sold or normally would have been sold during
the census year'' [Hallberg, 2001]. This definitional change
would result in a reduction in the number of farms enum-
erated by the census and would also tend to reduce the area
of land in farms enumerated by the census. Yet, between
1974 and 1978, there was an increase in the area of land in
farms, so that the impact of the definitional changes seems to
be masked by the changes in land management.
[51] Short-term disturbances occurring between census
years may not be reflected in these data. The census focused
on farmlands, but there are no comparable county-level data
on lands that are not in farms.

[52] Corrections to census data for a given year may be
included in tables published with later censuses. Dodd [1993]
states that the published counts are most accurate when
farthest away from the decade of the count. We used the
most recent source when we keyed data, but did not verify if
this was consistently done in existing digital data sources.
[53] Independent cities in Virginia are sometimes in-
cluded in census data and sometimes not included, depend-
ing on the decade and the source. We matched the spatial
data with the census source for each census year, but the
result is not a smooth time series for some of these areas.
6. Conclusions
[54] We developed a database of changes in population and
agricultural land, primarily from digital sources, to which we
added some revisions and corrections. The county-level data
provide more spatial detail than was previously available. For
the conterminous United States, the area in total cropland
peaked in 1940, but this is a synthesis of underlying regional
trends. The total cropland area in the Northeast peaked in
1880, after which transportation of agricultural goods from
the better soils of the Midwest and Great Plains became
competitive. The Midwest and Great Plains total cropland
area peaked in 1940 at 53.9% of the entire land and then
declined slightly to 45.5% in 1997. In the Southeast, the
cropland area peaked in 1920 at 29.5% of the land and then
decreased to 16.4% in 1997; pine tree plantations have been
developed on many areas that were formerly cropland.
[55] Although the database was developed to meet the
needs of our carbon modeling work, we expect that it may
be useful for other disciplines too. For the physical sciences,
the data may be useful for studies of hydrology, biogeog-
raphy, and climate. For the social sciences, it may be useful
for studies of patterns of settlement, migration, and the
interactions of humans and the environment. Many other
census attributes could be attached to the spatial data for
studies of ethnicity, religion, and demographics.
[56] Future work in the MBCP will use these data to
model the carbon dynamics on the landscape as influenced
by land-use change. Although a full land-use history at the
county level would be highly desirable, including forests,
grasslands, wetlands, and urban areas, its development will
require sources of data other than the census.
Appendix A: Spatial Edits (1949­1997)
[57] Copies of the CTY2M data set were created, and minor
edits were made to account for changes in county boundaries
or names. This resulted in the following four spatial data sets,
designed to match the census data for each period:
1. For 1987 to 1997, the CTY2M spatial data were used
without modification from the National Atlas source.
2. In 1983, La Paz County, Arizona, was established from
part of Yuma County. For the 1982 data set, the boundary
was removed, and the entire area was labeled Yuma.
3. In 1979, the FIPS code for Sainte Genevieve, Missouri,
was changed. In 1981, Cibola County, New Mexico, was
established from part of Valencia County. For the 1978 data
set, the Cibola boundary was removed, and the entire area
was labeled Valencia.
4. In the mid-1970s, Washabaugh County, South Dakota,
was merged into Jackson County, and Nansemond County,
Virginia, was renamed Suffolk County. For the 1949­1974
data set, a boundary delineation was added to provide for
Washabaugh County, South Dakota.
Appendix B: Geographic and Definitional
Changes
[58] Changes in geographic boundaries and census defi-
nitions that influence data interpretation are given here by
decade.
B1. 1790
[59] The United States consisted of the 13 original states
plus the Southwest Territory (now Tennessee), the North-
west Territory (now Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,
Wisconsin, and part of Minnesota), and the districts of
Kentucky, Maine, and Vermont. Some data exist for the
Southwest Territory, but none for the Northwest Territory.
Georgia covers what is now a three-state area, but there are
data for the eastern part only. South Carolina contains two
counties with no data (Cheraws and Orangeburg), and North
Carolina also contains a parcel of Indian land with no data.
Slaves were enumerated as whole persons.
B2. 1800
[60] Georgia included most of modern-day Mississippi
and Alabama. There was also a Mississippi Territory in the
southern part of Mississippi and Alabama, with population
recorded in three counties. Florida and the coastline of the
Gulf of Mexico belonged to Spain, as did the entire western
part of mid-America. The Indiana Territory surrounded the
western Great Lakes, and the Northwest Territory covered
the eastern half of the current Michigan and all of what is
now Ohio.
B3. 1810
[61] The Louisiana Purchase was made in 1803, and data
were included in the 1810 census only for the parts of the
area that had been organized into territories. The census did
not include the coastal parts of the present states of Mis-
sissippi and Alabama, which were claimed by both Spain
and the United States and were known as ``Spanish West
Florida.'' Florida was also under Spanish jurisdiction.
B4. 1820
[62] The purchase of Florida was not ratified until 1821,
so it still belonged to Spain at the time of the 1820 census.
B5. 1830
[63] The Northwestern states were jointly occupied by the
United States and Britain. Both countries also claimed parts
of Vermont, Maine, and an area north of Maine in what is
now Canada. Florida was included in the census of 1830 as
a territory.
B6. 1840
[64] The census included inventories of farm animals and
crop production but not agricultural land areas.
84 - 14 WAISANEN AND BLISS: AGRICULTURAL LAND CHANGE
B7. 1850
[65] For the first time, ``acres of land in farms'' were
recorded. The census included a category for improved
land, defined as ``cleared and used for grazing, grass, or
tillage, or which is now fallow, connected with or belonging
to the farm.'' The ``unimproved land'' was defined as [U.S.
Census, 1853] ``. . .land connected with the farm. It is not
necessary that it should be contiguous to the improved land;
but may be a wood lot, or other land at some distance, but
owned in connexion (sic) with the farm, the timber or range
of which is used for farm purpose.'' We summed the areas
of improved and unimproved land in farms to calculate the
total farm area.
B8. 1860
[66] Modern-day Oklahoma was ``Indian Territory,'' and
no census was taken there. The census taken in 1860
included improved and unimproved land in farms, as in
1850.
B9. 1870
[67] The state of West Virginia was created from the
northwestern part of Virginia in 1863. In the aftermath of
the Civil War, the 1870 census was underfunded and
disorganized. The data are probably less reliable than those
for prior and subsequent censuses. For example, ``a correct
census in 1870 would have reported at least 1,000,000 more
acres'' for land in farms in the region including Pennsylva-
nia, New Jersey, and states to the north and east [U.S.
Census, 1902, p. xix]. The 1870 census categories included
improved land, unimproved woodland, other unimproved
land, and population.
B10. 1880
[68] The regular census omitted Indians not taxed, and
therefore Indian reservations in all of Oklahoma and parts of
the Dakota Territory show zero values for population and
farmland. Dodd [1993, p. xviii] refers to ``special Indian
schedules'' dated October 1880. In decades prior to 1890,
the locations of the tribes are not well documented by the
census. Much additional research would be required to
properly account for American Indian population and agri-
culture. In Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, and North Dakota,
enumerators reported ``no population'' in some counties.
Table B1 shows the categories of farmlands, which were
inventoried in acres.
[69] In 1880, farmland and improved land in Pennsylva-
nia, New Jersey, and states to the north and east exceeded
those of the surrounding decades. This peak is questioned in
a volume of the 1900 census [U.S. Census, 1902].
B11. 1890
[70] The census categories included acres of improved
and unimproved land, as in 1850 and 1860. The definitions
were clarified, stating ``no farm of less than 3 acres was
enumerated unless at least $500 worth of product had been
actually sold from the same during the calendar year
preceding the census year. The improved acreage includes
entire land once cultivated, unless afterward abandoned, and
all permanent meadows and pastures'' [U.S Census, 1896].
[71] Population counts of Native Americans were avail-
able for most counties and reservations. We keyed data for
territories and Indian populations that were included in
census tables for minor civil divisions and other documents
[U.S. Census, 1891, 1895], but were not included in the
county census tables or the ICPSR data set. In the 1890 and
1900 timeframe, some of the Indian reservations were being
moved, and it was not always clear how to associate
reservation names to counties. The low counts for area of
farmland on some reservations could be due either to an
undercount or to a lack of farming.
B12. 1900
[72] The census counted total farm acres and improved
farm acres. We calculated the unimproved farmland area by
subtracting improved acres from total farm acres.
[73] The county census tables accounted for more than
half of the Native American population and agricultural
land on reservations [U.S. Census, 1902; Tables 4, 12, and
19]. Additional data were found in another census chapter,
Agriculture on Indian Reservations [U.S. Census, 1902, pp.
718­741] that provides numbers for most tribes, listing the
reservations and tribes by county or counties. We substi-
tuted the data from this chapter for the original county data
only when the numbers were larger, because it was some-
times unclear whether the Native American numbers were
included with the county data.
[74] In approximately 20 Texas counties, the unimproved
farmland acreage exceeded by 20% of the total county area
calculated by the geographic information system, which we
attribute to enumerating the area of multicounty ranches in
the county of the ranch headquarters.
B13. 1910
[75] The 1910 census tables included a complete set of
information for Native American populations and agricul-
tural lands.
[76] Inventories of farmland were split by ownership, so
we summed the land in farms for owners, tenants, and
managers to calculate total land in farms. Similarly, the
improved lands were summed over the ownership categories.
[77] Large Texas ranches were again counted in the
county of the headquarters, although acreage was included
for land in unnamed adjacent counties. This causes the acres
of farmland (for seven counties) and unimproved land (for

six counties) to exceed the area calculated by the geographic
information system.
B14. 1920
[78] The census inventoried the following: approximate
land area; total land in farms; improved land in farms;
woodland in farms; and other unimproved land in farms. We
summed the woodland and ``other unimproved lands''
categories to calculate total unimproved lands. As with
some Texas counties, the farm acreages for Grant County,
Nebraska, included areas for adjacent counties.
B15. 1925
[79] The Census tabulated county data for 1925, but we
did not find a source in digital form and did not key them.
The ``improved farmland'' category was discontinued and
``cropland'' was first enumerated in 1925 [U.S. Census,
1927].
B16. 1930
[80] The census inventoried farmland acres using catego-
ries listed in Table B2. We added the plowable pasture data
[U.S. Census, 1932a] as a component of cropland, in order
to be consistent with definitions of cropland in prior and
later years.
B17. 1935
[81] As with 1925, the county data for 1935 were tabu-
lated, but we did not find a source in digital form and did
not key them. The national summary numbers for 1935 are
included in Figure 2 [U.S. Census, 1936].
B18. 1940
[82] The original 1940 census county tables [U.S. Census,
1942] include the categories shown in Table B3. The
category referenced as ``cropland used only for pasture''
in the 1945 volume uses the numerical values designated as
``plowable pasture'' in the 1940 volume. The 1940 category
``plowable pasture'' represents pasture that either has been
or could potentially be used for cropland, whereas the 1945
``category cropland used only for pasture'' indicates land
that has been plowed within the last 7 years and was used as
pasture at the time of the census. The pasture, woodland,
and ``all other land'' categories in the 1945 volume [U.S.
Census, 1946] were footnoted as ``not available'' for 1940,
even though they are included in the original 1940 data
[U.S. Census, 1942].
B19. 1945
[83] We keyed the categories [U.S. Census, 1946] shown
in Table B4 because we were unable to locate a county-level
digital source. The change in definition from plowable
pasture in 1940 to cropland used for pasture in 1945
introduces a change in the time series for improved farmland
(1850­1920) and the variables that sum to an equivalent
measure (1925 and later). The magnitude of the change
cannot be calculated precisely. The change is on the order
of 341,000 km2, calculated by subtracting the 1945 cropland
used for pasture from the 1940 plowable pasture.
B20. 1949 Through 1974
[84] The ICPSR provided agricultural land data for 1949
and population information for 1950. We attached the
ICPSR population data for 1950 and 1960 to the LSU
delineations.
[85] Agricultural land data from the Economic Research
Service [1999] were available for 1949, 1954, 1959, 1964,
1969, and 1974. We attached these data to the CTY2M
spatial data using the FIPS code. Both the ICPSR and the
Economic Research Service provided agricultural land data
for 1949, so we compared the data to validate the accuracy of
both data sets. Minor differences were found, and we used
the Economic Research Service source. Table B5 shows the
agricultural classifications attached to the spatial data.
[86] The Economic Research Service CD-ROM included
fields of Class IV farm data for 1964, 1969, and 1974 that
are sometimes populated. A Class IV farm is defined as a

split by ownership.

farm earning more than $2500 in agricultural sales. The
total farm data include the Class IV farm data. Also, areas of
irrigated land, drained land, and the other miscellaneous
categories listed above are already included in the hierarchy
of cropland categories under ``land in farms.'' Although
Hawaii and Alaska became states in 1959, they are not
included in our study area.
B21. 1978 and 1982
[87] Separate versions of the CTY2M spatial data set were
used for 1978 and 1982 because there were county boun-
dary and FIPS code changes. Table B6 shows the agricul-
tural variables that were loaded (in acres) for 1978 and
1982.
B22. 1987, 1992, and 1997
[88] The 1987, 1992, and 1997 data are available digitally
from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Data for
land under the conservation reserve or wetlands reserve
programs were included. There were no changes in county
delineations or FIPS codes between 1987 and 1997. Data
for the area in acres for each of the following agricultural
categories were attached to the CTY2M spatial data set. The
categories are shown in Table B7.
