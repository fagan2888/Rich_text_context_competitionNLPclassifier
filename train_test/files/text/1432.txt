OBJECTIVE: To assess the interaction between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and occupational activity (OA) on the
prevalence of obesity.
DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of a population based cross-sectional US national sample (NHANES III).
SUBJECTS: A total of 4889 disease-free, currently employed adults over age 20 y.
MEASUREMENTS: Subjects body mass index (BMI) was categorized as (1) obese (BMI ! 30 kgam2), or (2) non-obese
(BMI ` 30 kgam2). LTPA was divided into four categories: (1) no LTPA; (2) irregular LTPA; (3) regular moderate intensity LTPA;
and (4) regular vigorous intensity LTPA. OA was grouped as (1) high OA and (2) low OA. Age, gender, race ± ethnicity, smoking
status, urbanization classi®cation, alcohol consumption and income were statistically controlled.
RESULTS: In all, 16.8% (s.e. 0.7) of the total subject population were obese (15.1% (s.e. 1.1) of men and 19.1% (s.e. 1.1) of
women). Logistic regression revealed that compared to those who engage in no LTPA and have low levels of OA, the likelihood
of being obese is 42% (95% CI 0.35, 0.96) lower for those who engage in no LTPA and have high OA, 48% (95% CI 0.32, 0.83)
lower for those who have irregular LTPA and have high levels of OA, and about 50% lower for all those who have regular LTPA
through moderate or vigorous activity levels regardless of OA level.
CONCLUSION: When considering disease free adults above 20 y of age employed in high and low activity occupations, a high
level of occupational activity is associated with a decreased likelihood of being obese.

Introduction
In Healthy People 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) established a national objective to reduce
the proportion of adults who are obese (body mass index,
BMI ` 30) to 15%.1 According to data from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), one-third of the US population is overweight2
and over one-®fth of the population is considered obese.3
Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
and is commonly found in conjunction with other CVD risk
factors such as hypertension,4 type 2 diabetes,5,6 andaor
hypercholesterolemia.7
There is little doubt that obesity in the United States has
reached epidemic proportions8 and that each year there are
substantial health care costs associated with obesity-related
pathologies.9 Many experts attribute the high prevalence of
obesity to inactivity. Evidence from epidemiological and
interventional research shows that those engaged in higher
levels of physical activity have lower stores of body fat.10 An
association between recreational activity and body weight
was seen by Williamson et al11 when analyzing 10 y follow-
up data of men and women from NHANES I. After 10 y, BMI
was signi®cantly higher in the lowest activity group com-
pared to those in the highest activity group.11 In addition to
protection from obesity, physical activity has other well-
established positive effects on health.12 ± 18 While physical
inactivity during leisure-time is commonly associated with
obesity, the amount of physical activity accumulated
through occupational activity should also be considered.
The effects of occupational activity on pathologic condi-
tions have been under investigation for some time.19 ± 26 To
our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the
interaction between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and
occupational activity (OA) and corresponding prevalence of

sized that those with the lowest levels of LTPA and OA will
have the highest prevalence of obesity while those with the
highest levels of LTPA and OA will have the lowest preva-
lence of obesity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
assess the prevalence of obesity and its association with
varying levels of LTPA and OA.
Methods
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a
periodic survey conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics. The third NHANES was conducted from 1988
through 1994 and was the seventh in a series of surveys
based on a complex, multistage sample plan. It was designed
to provide national estimates of the health and nutritional
status of the United States' civilian, non-institutionalized
population over the age of 2 months. A detailed description
of the data collection has been previously published.27
Physical activity assessment
During a comprehensive interview, respondents were asked
to identify speci®ed exercises in which they participated
during their leisure-time (jogging or running; riding a bicycle
or exercise bicycle; swimming; aerobic dancing; other dan-
cing; calisthenics or ¯oor exercises; gardening or yard work;
and weight lifting). They were then requested to specify the
number of times they participated in an identi®ed activity in
relation to the past month. Responses were standardized as
`times per week' using the conversion factors 4.3 weeks per
month and 30.4 days per month, then rounded to the
nearest whole number. Those responses of 100 times per
month or more were categorized as `100  '. The frequency of
performance of other reported exercises, sports or physically
active hobbies was also recorded. After administering the list
of speci®ed physical activities, interviewers probed for other
exercises, sports or physical activities not mentioned.3 Infor-
mation related to duration of activities was not collected and
limits this study.
LTPA was divided into four categories using frequency and
intensity as classi®cation criteria. Each LTPA was classi®ed
according to intensity level as de®ned by the Compendium
of Physical Activities28 using the metabolic equivalent (MET)
level corresponding to an individual activity. As previously
described by Pate et al,29 activities requiring between 1 and 3
METs were classi®ed as `low intensity,' activities requiring
between 3 and 6 METs were classi®ed as `moderate intensity,'
and those activities requiring 6 METs and above were classi-
®ed as `vigorous intensity.' Individuals who answered `no' to
all LTPA questions were coded as having `no LTPA' and those
who participated in LTPA between 1 and 4 times per week of
any intensity were coded as having `irregular LTPA.' Respon-
dents, who participated in ®ve or more bouts of LTPA per
week were coded as `regular LTPA'. The `regular LTPA' group
was subdivided into those engaging in moderate (regular
moderate LTPA) and vigorous (regular vigorous LTPA) inten-
sity activity. The de®nition of regular LPTA ( ! 5 bouts per
week) was chosen to correspond with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of
Sports Medicine (ACSM) frequency recommendation for
physical activity (`on most, if not all, days of the week').30
Occupational activity assessment
The NHANES III database contains 498 reported occupations
classi®ed into one of 235 different industrial categories based
on the 1980 census classi®cation codes.31 The 498 occupa-
tions were then recoded within the NHANES III database
into 40 occupation categories. For this study, all individuals
of a six-member committee independently examined each of
498 occupations and grouped into those containing (a) high
occupational activity (HOA), (b) low occupational activity
(LOA), or (c) uncertain, based on the occupation description
of the US Department of Labor.32,33 An occupation was
labeled as `uncertain' if the activity level was too ambiguous
to classify. A nominal group process was used to gain 100%
committee consensus on both HOA and LOA occupations. A
total of 119 occupations in 17 occupation categories were
positively identi®ed as either HOA or LOA (7 and 10 cate-
gories, respectively). Table 1 shows the occupation categories
used for analysis.
Sample
The NHANES III database contains information on 33 994
individuals. In all, 20 050 adults over age 18 y were eligible
for this study. Of those eligible, 16 284 completed both the
home interview and the clinical exam. Those individuals
diagnosed with heart disease, cancer, degenerative joint
disorders, or other pathologic conditions that may limit
LTPA or work were excluded from the analysis. Inclusion of
apparently non-healthy individuals could have possibly
skewed the data of the no LTPA and LOA groups, making

unhealthy people allowed for a cleaner assessment of a
possible direct association between total physical activity
and obesity status and helped minimize selection bias
error. Additionally, only those individuals currently
employed in one of the 17 occupational categories identi®ed
as LOA or HOA (Table 1) were included in the study. A ®nal
sample population of 4889 individuals was identi®ed
as meeting the requirements for this study. Individuals
were then classi®ed as non-obese (BMI ` 30 kgam2) or
obese (BMI ! 30 kgam2) as de®ned by the World Health
Organization.34
Statistical analysis
Analysis of the data set was performed using the statistical
programs SAS and SUDAAN.35,36 All analyses incorporated
sampling weights and the complex sampling design adopted
by NHANES III.27,37 Age-adjusted prevalence rates were cal-
culated using the direct method and were based on the total
US population for 1980. The dependant variable was obesity.
The primary independent variable was physical activity,
(combinations of LTPA and OA levels). Eight possible com-
binations of LTPA and OA were coded for analysis. Other
independent variables that were statistically controlled
included age, gender, race-ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
smoking status, alcohol consumption, and urbanization
classi®cation. To determine the likelihood of obesity inde-
pendent of statistically controlled variables, a logistic regres-
sion model was applied to the dataset. Each independent
variable was weighted and standardized to the general US
population and analyzed with all other variables being con-
trolled. The referent group for gender was men; age was 20 ±
29 y; race-ethnicity was non-Hispanic white; income
was b $50 000; smoking status was non-smoker; urbaniza-
tion classi®cation was urban; and alcohol consumption was
light. The no LTPA and LOA group served as the referent
group for the LTPA and OA interaction.
Results
Table 2 shows the sample size and the age-adjusted obesity
prevalence rates within the disease-free adult population
employed in high and low activity occupations for gender,
age, race-ethnicity, income and OA level. As a whole, 16.8%
of the population had a BMI ! 30 kgam2 with 15.1% of men
and 19.1% of women being obese (Table 2). The prevalence
of obesity increased through age 59 and then began to
decline (Table 2). The prevalence of obesity was higher in
non-Hispanic blacks (23.4%) and Mexican Americans
(22.0%) compared to non-Hispanic whites (16.1%). Those
in the lowest annual income bracket had the highest pre-
valence of obesity (21.5%), while those in the highest
income category had the lowest obesity prevalence
(15.9%); (Table 2). The prevalence of obesity was higher in
those with LOA levels (17.4%) compared to those with HOA
levels (15.7%; Table 2).
The prevalence of obesity within the age-adjusted disease-
free adult population above 20 y of age employed in high
and low activity occupations for OA level and LTPA are
shown in Table 3. Overall, 20.4% of those engaging in no
LTPA were obese and the prevalence of obesity decreased
with increased LTPA (18.8%, 15.4% and 9.0% for irregular
LTPA, regular moderate LTPA, and regular vigorous LTPA,
respectively, Table 3). In relation to LTPA levels, 23.8% of all
those with LOA and engage in no LTPA were shown to be
obese compared to 13.6% of all those with HOA and engage
in no LTPA (Table 3; Figure 1).
The overall logistic regression analysis model was found
to be highly signi®cant (P ` 0.0001). The logistic regression
(Table 4) revealed that the likelihood of being obese was
linked to other socio-cultural and lifestyle factors. The like-
lihood of being obese increased with age up to about age
60 y. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks
were 68% more likely to be obese, and Mexican Americans
were 49% more likely to be obese. Annual income was
unrelated to obesity prevalence in any income category
compared to those whose income was b $50 000 except for
those in the $30 000 ± 39 999 category, who were 59% more
likely to be obese. Additionally, it was found that current
smokers were less likely to be obese than ex- or non-smokers
and neither urbanization classi®cation or alcohol consumption
in¯uenced the likelihood of being obese.

The likelihood of being obese was strongly associated with
LTPA and OA (Table 4). Those who engaged in no LTPA and
had HOA were 42% less likely to be obese compared to those
who engaged in no LTPA and had LOA. The likelihood of
being obese for those who engaged in irregular LTPA and had
LOA was similar to those who engaged in no LTPA and had
LOA. Those who engaged in irregular LTPA and had HOA
and those who engaged in regular LTPA with moderate or
vigorous activity were about half as likely to be obese than
the no LTPA and LOA group. The greatest reduction in the
likelihood of being obese was seen in the regular moderate
LTPA and LOA group (73%) compared to the no LTPA and
LOA group (Table 4).
Discussion
It appears that a physically active occupation has a protec-
tive effect on the likelihood of being obese for the disease-
free adult population above 20 y of age employed in high
and low activity occupations independent of gender, age,
race-ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking status, urba-
nization classi®cation and alcohol consumption. For those
individuals who engage in no LTPA or irregular LTPA, the
likelihood of being obese can be reduced by as much as one-
half with a physically active occupation (Table 4).
The major ®nding of this study is seen with the interac-
tion between LTPA and OA. Having a highly active occupa-
tion reduced the likelihood of being obese by 42% even
without participation in any LTPA (Table 4). The likelihood
of being obese was similar between those who had sedentary
occupations and engaged in either no LTPA or LTPA less than
®ve times per week (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57, 1.08). For the
person participating in irregular LTPA, a highly active occu-
pation reduced the likelihood of being obese by almost 50%
compared to those who were sedentary during both work

and leisure-time. Once the frequency of LTPA was suf®cient
to meet the CDCaACSM recommendations ( ! 5 bouts per
week), the likelihood of obesity remained about 50% less
regardless of the level of OA, emphasizing the importance of
regular physical activity.
It should be noted that the actual intensity level of an
occupation was not measured and the energy cost of an
occupation was not quanti®ed. The methods used to cate-
gorize occupations classi®ed each only as being of a generally
high or low activity level. The conversion of OA from a
categorical to a continuous variable would most likely
strengthen the in¯uence of OA on obesity prevalence.
It is also important to point out that the duration of
LTPA was not reported within the survey and therefore, it
is impossible to quantify total energy expenditure. The
discrepancy in odds ratio between the regular moderate
LTPA and regular vigorous LTPA groups (OR 0.27, 95% CI
0.18, 0.43 and OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24, 0.93, respectively,
compared to no LTPA and LOA) may possibly be the result
of differing total energy expenditures related to the dura-
tion of activity rather than the intensity of the activity.
Since individual group differences were not empirically
tested, comparisons can only be made to the referent
group. However, based on the overlapping 95% CI of the
regular moderate LTPA and regular vigorous LTPA, these
groups do not appear to be signi®cantly different from
each other.
An additional limitation is the categorization of irregular
LTPA, de®ned for this study as one to four bouts of physical
activity per week. It could be argued that a person who
participates in physical activity four times per week is a
regular exerciser. We de®ned LTPA categories based on fre-
quency of participation to coincide with the CDCaACSM
physical activity guidelines for frequency as most days of the
week. This was interpreted to mean a majority of days of the
week (®ve or more). The results of this study show that the
likelihood of being obese is similar between the no LTPA and
irregular LTPA groups with sedentary occupations (OR 0.78,
95% CI 0.57, 1.08). This supports the methods used to
classify LTPA categories and emphasizes the important ben-
e®ts of a physically active occupation and the bene®ts of
regular activity during leisure-time.
Previous studies have used the NHANES database as a
nationally representative sample of the US popula-
tion.2,3,34,38,39 This study is unique because it focuses on
the effects of OA and LTPA in a currently employed US
national sample while controlling for several confounding
variables. Previous studies of NHANES III report the preva-
lence of physical inactivity as 22% (17% for men and 27% for
women)3,38 and a number of socio-cultural variables appear
to in¯uence the prevalence of LTPA. Previously it has been
reported that physical activity levels are higher in younger
compared to older individuals, higher with increased socio-
economic status, and that ethnic minorities tend to have a
higher prevalence of inactivity compared to non-Hispanic
whites.30,38 Crespo et al39 found an inverse relationship
between the prevalence of physical inactivity and social
class derived from occupation, education and income. In
the sample we analyzed, the prevalence of no LTPA is
approximately 10% lower for currently employed non-His-
panic blacks and Mexican Americans compared to all non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans in the general US
population.38 It is possible that the socio-cultural in¯uence
of employment may induce the differences in the prevalence
of physical inactivity seen between the general US popula-
tion and the current sample of those employed in occupa-
tions with high or low levels of physical activity, although
this was not tested in this study.

Obesity prevalence
GA King et al

Similar to physical inactivity, the prevalence of obesity is
suggested to be inversely related to education, socioeco-
nomic status, and cultural in¯uences.2,40 Analysis of the
NHANES III database shows that for the general US popula-
tion above age 20 y, the prevalence of obesity
(BMI b 30 kgam2) was reported to be approximately 20% for
men and 25% for women.3 Our study found the prevalence
of obesity for the disease-free adults above 20 y of age
employed in high and low activity occupations to be
16.8% (15.1% for men and 19.1% for women). The lower
prevalence of obesity within the present sample was
expected because only disease-free individuals were included
in the analysis. The elimination of those with obesity related
pathologies (for example hypertension, diabetes, heart dis-
ease) most likely removed a portion of the obese population.
Also, a majority of the currently employed population main-
tained occupations too ambiguous to classify as having high
or low activity levels. The elimination of ambiguous occupa-
tions again most likely remove a portion of the obese
population but should have also removed a proportional
number of the non-obese population and should not have
affected the ®nal sample. The logistic regression model
applied in this study found race-ethnicity to in¯uence obe-
sity prevalence while income did not, independent of age,
smoking status, urbanization classi®cation, alcohol con-
sumption and occupation. While no causal in¯uence can
be drawn from these ®ndings, these data suggest that there
are other underlying factors that in¯uence the prevalence
of obesity between race-ethnicity groups besides those
controlled for in this study.
A number of previous studies have focused on all-cause or
CVD mortality and morbidity rates or cardiovascular event
incidence rates in relation to work19,22,41 or
LTPA.12,15,18,19,22,41,42 Some studies have also investigated
the combined effects of work and LTPA.13,14,16,17,20,21 In
those previous studies, body composition was reported as a
contributing variable rather than the major variable of
interest. This is the ®rst study to compare the combined
effects of varying levels of physical activity during work and
leisure-time on the prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor
for CVD and contributor to a number of chronic pathologies.
As with other cross-sectional data of this type, causality
cannot be determined. While it may be hypothesized that
lower activity levels lead to obesity, it is also possible that
obese individuals select less active jobs and leisure-time
pursuits. In light of this, the information from this study
may facilitate health promotion planners to develop work
site intervention activities and programs towards those
workers within a company at the greatest risk of obesity
and obesity-related pathologies.
There is little question as to the importance of physical
activity for long-term weight management and our study
provides further evidence that the positive effects of activity
are from the accumulation of total daily energy expenditure.
The results of this study do not discount the importance of
regular LTPA and everyone should be encouraged to engage
in regular exercise. What is suggested by this study is that
activity derived through a physically active occupation can
reduce the likelihood of being obese, especially for those
who participate in little or no physical activity during their
leisure-time. For those individuals who do not engage in
LTPA, the likelihood of being obese can be reduced by about
half if they maintain a physically active occupation.
