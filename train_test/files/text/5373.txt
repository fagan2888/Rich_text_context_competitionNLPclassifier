Article
Hepatitis C (HCV) remains a serious health concern globally
and within the United States. In the United States alone, it
has been estimated that more than three million people are
living with chronic HCV (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC], 2012; Ly et al., 2012) and that annual
mortality due to HCV has now surpassed deaths due to HIV
(Smith et al., 2012). Although the CDC has declared HCV a
generalized epidemic and recommends screening for persons
above 55 (Smith et al., 2012), injection drug use remains the
main route of transmission for HCV. Prevention of and
understanding needle sharing and other unsafe injection
practices therefore is critical to reducing the spread of HCV.
J. D. Fisher and Fisher (1992) originally proposed the
Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model
describing HIV prevention behaviors. This model postulated
a direct relationship between HIV prevention behaviors and
three independent constructs (factors). The first construct is
the amount of prevention-related information an individual
possesses, such that information about prevention behaviors
is a necessary but not sufficient condition for engaging in the
behaviors themselves. Second, motivation to engage in pre-
vention behaviors increases the likelihood of performing the
behavior. Finally, an individual's skill in performing the
behavior is directly related with behavioral completion. In
addition to these direct paths, the effect of information and
motivation is mediated through behavioral skills such that
both may affect skill acquisition and therefore behavior.

Adaptation of the Information-Motivation-
Behavioral Skills Model to Needle
Sharing Behaviors and Hepatitis C Risk: A
Structural Equation Model
William T. Robinson1,2
Abstract
The current study adapts the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of health behavior to injection drug using
risk behaviors and risk for Hepatitis C (HCV). Briefly, this model postulates that prevention behaviors are directly influenced
by an individual's knowledge about a disease, their motivation to avoid the disease and their skills and capacity to engage in
prevention behaviors, while information and motivation also directly influence behavioral skills. Scales for HCV information,
motivation and behavioral skills were included in the New Orleans arm of the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS)
of Injection Drug Use study. A structural equation model was tested on a sample of 108 current injection drug users
recruited in December 2012. Results showed good fit of the IMB model. Although participants had high levels of information
and knowledge about HCV transmission, information was not found to relate to either behavioral skills or needle sharing.
Higher levels of skills were directly related to lower levels of needle sharing. In addition, motivation had an indirect effect on
needle sharing that was mediated through skills. Many approaches to HIV and HCV prevention focus on increasing awareness
and information about HIV and risk behaviors. This model, however, appears to indicate that increasing awareness may not
be as effective as interventions or programs that increase behavioral skills or motivation coupled with skills building. Although
some HIV/STD prevention interventions, such as motivational interviews do attempt to capitalize on this relationship, more
efforts should be made to incorporate this important link into high impact prevention programs.

Anumber of studies conducted in a diverse variety of popu-
lations have demonstrated the success of this model in describ-
ing these factors and their relation to HIVprevention behaviors
most commonly using condom use (Bryan, Fisher, Fisher, &
Murray, 2000; Cai et al., 2013; Crosby et al., 2008; Walsh,
Senn, Scott-Sheldon, Vanable, & Carey, 2011) or adherence to
antiretroviral medication (Ferrer, Morrow, Fisher, & Fisher,
2010; J. D. Fisher, Amico, Fisher, & Harman, 2008; Starace,
Massa, Amico, & Fisher, 2006) as behavioral outcomes.
Although initially developed within the context of HIV pre-
vention behaviors, the model has also been successfully gener-
alized to a number of health-related topics including sexual
and reproductive health such as HPV vaccination (W. A.
Fisher, 2012), abstinence (Bazargan, Kelly, Stein, Husaini, &
Bazargan, 2000), as well as broader general health topics
including nutrition, diabetes, and dieting behaviors (Gao,
Wang, Zhu, & Yu, 2013; Goodell, Pierce, Amico, & Ferris,
2012; Osborn & Egede, 2010), tuberculosis (Peltzer, Naidoo,
Matseke, & Zuma, 2011), substance use, and smoking cessa-
tion (Shell, Newman, Perry, & Folsom, 2011).
Some of these studies have met with limited success at dem-
onstrating all theorized relationships (i.e., paths) predicted by
the IMB model leading some to suggest that the utility of the
model is best suited as a framework for intervention develop-
ment (Kalichman, Picciana, & Roffman, 2008). Many studies
have either adapted portions of the model for use in intervention
research (Konkle-Parker, Amico, & McKinney, 2014; Kudo,
2013; Laisaar, Uuskula, Sharma, DeHovitz, & Amico, 2013) or
used path analytic approaches to test the relationships in the
model (Amico, Toro-Alfonso, & Fisher, 2005). Few studies
have applied the model to specific risk factors of needle sharing
and unsafe injection practice. None, however, have included
needle sharing behavior or hepatitis disease risks as outcome
constructs. The purpose of the current study then is to adapt the
IMB model to injection behaviors and HCV risk and to test the
fit of the resultant model within a structural equation modeling
(SEM) environment.
Method
Participants
Five hundred four persons who inject drugs were surveyed as
part of the New Orleans Louisiana arm of the CDC NHBS
system during August to December 2012. Eligibility require-
ments were that participants were 18 years of age or older,
were a residents of the New Orleans seven parish metropoli-
tan area, were able to take the survey in English, and had
injected drugs within the past 12 months. Current injector
status was carefully screened using visible signs of recent
injection and/or detailed knowledge of injection practice.
Recruitment
Participants were recruited through the NHBS of Injection
Drug Use study using respondent driven sampling (RDS)
procedures, which have been described elsewhere (Lansky
et al., 2007). RDS is a modified chain referral approach that
uses a dual incentive structure, which has been shown to
have success recruiting members of hidden populations such
as persons who inject drugs (Abdul-Quader et al., 2006;
Robinson et al., 2006). Following these procedures, a set of
eight known members of the target population acted as initial
"seeds," were surveyed, and were offered a free HIV and
HCV test. Each seed was then given the opportunity to
recruit up to five members of their social network who were
known by them to be current injectors. Each respondent was
then also surveyed, offered an HIV test, and given the oppor-
tunity to recruit up to five respondents. Recruitment pro-
ceeded in this fashion until both a sufficient number of waves
to reach equilibrium and the desired sample size was reached.
Respondents received a US$20 value gift card for survey
participation and an additional US$20 gift cart for HIV test-
ing. An additional US$10 gift card was provided for each
successfully recruited additional respondent.
Instruments
The NHBS core survey instrument was administered to each
participant. The approximately 40-min survey covers a wide
spectrum of questions on sexual behavior, substance use, and
HIV testing behaviors as indicators of HIV risk. An addi-
tional set of scales for the information, motivation, and
behavioral skills constructs were developed by adapting
items from the literature. These items were asked to a subset
of respondents during the last month of the survey; therefore
only the 108 individuals who completed the survey in
December 2012 were used for purposes of these analyses.
HCV transmission information (Cronbach's  = .64) was
indicated by a set of five knowledge items on the ways HCV
is transmitted adapted from Balfour's HCV knowledge scale
(Balfour et al., 2009). Although some IMB studies have con-
ceptualized the information factor as containing domains of
prevention knowledge as well as generalized knowledge
about the disease of interest, only transmission information
was included in this study. Questions were a set of statements
such as `HCV is a virus transmitted by blood' that partici-
pants were asked to rate as true or false. Correct answers
were coded at unity while incorrect answers and responses of
"don't know" were coded as zero. Table 1 presents all ques-
tion wording.
Motivation (Cronbach's  = .74) to avoid HCV infection
included four items such as "I would never share needles or
works with anyone who had hepatitis." These items were
coded on a 5-point Likert-type scale of agreement (i.e., 0 =
strongly disagree; 1 = disagree; 2 = neither agree nor dis-
agree; 3 = agree; 4 = strongly agree).
The HCV Behavioral Skills scale (Cronbach's  = .87)
consisted of five Likert-type items on perceived behavioral
control of personal injection practices adapted from Kang,
Deren, Andia, Colon, and Robles (2004). Example questions
included "I am sure that I could always use a clean needle to
Robinson 3
inject with." Questions were worded such that higher scores
reflected greater certainty in risk behavior avoidance (0 =
very unsure, 1 = unsure, 2 = neither sure nor unsure, 3 =
sure, 4 = very sure).
The endogenous risk construct of the IMB model was
defined in terms of Needle Sharing Behaviors (Cronbach's 
= .86), which was operationalized by four core survey items
describing frequency of sharing needles, sharing injection
equipment, sharing cotton, and sharing water. Each item was
measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale with end and mid-
points describing frequency of each behavior within the past
12 months (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = about half the time, 4 =
most of the time, 5 = always). Higher levels indicate more
frequent risk behaviors (e.g., "In the past 12 months how
often did you use needles that someone else had already
injected with?").
Each respondent was also offered a free rapid HIV test
with a Clearview Complete HIV-1/2 screening performed
on blood obtained by fingerstick, which was followed by
confirmatory Western blot if needed. Respondents were
also offered a rapid OraQuick Rapid HCV antibody
screening test. Based on the result of the rapid HCV test
and self-reported previous HCV diagnosis, HCV status
was collapsed into a single categorical variable (HCV
negative, previous HCV positive, newly detected HCV).
All respondents received the results of their HIV and HCV
screening tests and appointments were made for individu-
als who received confirmatory exams to receive their
results within 2 weeks. All participants received appropri-
ate referrals for services based on the responses to the sur-
vey and test results.
Analyses
The hypothesized IMB model was tested using Mplus
Version 7 (Muthen & Muthen). Figure 1 displays a graphic
representation of the model with the two covarying exog-
enous constructs of information and motivation with
direct paths leading to the behavioral skills and risk
behavior constructs. In addition, direct paths from behav-
ioral skills onto risk behavior and from risk behavior to
HCV disease outcome were included. Total, direct and
indirect effects from information and motivation onto risk
were assessed. Because the model included dichotomous
items identifying the information construct and the cate-
gorical disease outcome measure, robust weighted least
squares (WLSMV) estimation methods were used to
obtain model estimates. The specified model was overi-
dentified with 58 degrees of freedom and converged
normally.

Results
Respondent Characteristics
The majority of respondents were male (76%) and the average
age was 43. Fifty-nine percent of respondents were African
American, 34% were White, and 3% were Hispanic. Previously
diagnosed HIV positive individuals comprised 6.5% of the sam-
ple, and 1.8% were newly identified based on HIVconfirmatory
testing. One quarter of participants (25%) had been ever told by
a doctor that they had HCV (also confirmed by screening), and
29.6% were newly detected HCV cases. Table 2 presents the
full correlation matrix between indicator variables.
Measurement Model
The overall model fit was good with several standard mea-
sures indicating good fit of the model. Chi-square for the ini-
tial model was not significant at the .05 level, 2(146) =
166.6, p = .11. Also comparative fit index (CFI = .908) and
Tucker­Lewis fit index (TLI = .892) were adequate. The root
mean square error of approximation was .036 (confidence
interval [CI] = [.000, .06]), which was both less than .05 and
satisfied the tests of closeness of fit (p = .815) and exactness
of fit. All paths from latent constructs to the manifest indica-
tors in the measurement model were found to significantly
load on their respective construct with the exception of the
previously diagnosed HCV variable (H1 see Figure 1).
Structural Model
The standardized direct structural path from the behavioral
skills construct ( = -.42, SE = .12, t = -3.38, p < .001) to the
injection risk construct was found to be significant (see
Figure 1). Motivation directly influenced behavioral skills (
= .58, SE = .07, t = 7.65, p < .001) but was not significantly
related to injection risk through the direct pathway ( = -.16,
SE = .14, t = -1.13, p = .255). The total direct and indirect
contribution of motivation on injection behavior was signifi-
cant, however ( = -.24, SE = .08, t = -3.16, p = .002).
Information was not found to be significantly related to
either behavioral skills or the needle sharing risk behavior,
nor did it covary with motivation. Injection-related sharing
behaviors significantly predicted hepatitis infection ( = .32,
SE =.12, t = 2.61, p = .009).
Removal of the non-significant knowledge structural
paths did not significantly improve the fit of the model, 2(3)
= 2.43, n.s., and was not called for by modification indices,
therefore only the original model is presented here.
Discussion
The current study adapts the Information Motivation
Behavioral Skills model of HIV prevention behaviors to hep-
atitis risk and injection practice. Overall fit of the model was
good. The structural paths from behavioral skills as well as
the mediational path from motivation through behavioral
skills were found to be significant while knowledge did not
meaningfully contribute to the structural model. Furthermore,
the path from HCV risk behaviors to detection of HCV
through a rapid screening procedure was found to be
significant.
One interesting aspect of this study may be the inclusion
direct measures of HCV disease status as well as behavioral
risk factors as outcomes in an IMB SEM model. An

exploratory model including the additional outcome of HIV
infection was considered, however, was discarded because all
question domains were specific to HCV rather than HIV risk
and infection and because inclusion of the HIV indicator led to
linear dependencies within the model due to small cell sizes.
Although the current model fit the data adequately, some
weaknesses of the current study should be noted both in
terms of methodology as well as measurement. These include
the standard methodological issues with self-report and cross
sectional nature of the NHBS parent study. This is especially
relevant given the possible differential in timeframes between
HCV infection and risk behavior in the past 12 months. It
should also be noted that, while the RDS sampling procedure
should yield asymptotically correct population parameter
estimates after applying adjustments for homophily and net-
work size (Heckathorn, 2002), these adjustments were not
made. This was due to the fact that the additional IMB ques-
tions were administered to a subset of respondents thus inter-
rupting the recruitment chains needed to achieve the
equilibrium needed by RDS estimation procedures.
Furthermore, the primary interest in this study is to model the
associations between manifest variables and underlying fac-
tor patterns rather than the point prevalence estimates and
methods for adjusting these correlational measures have not
yet been fully developed.
In terms of measurement error, other studies using longer
scales have shown higher reliability as well as lower levels
of HCV knowledge in the injection population (Heimer
et al., 2002; Larios et al., 2014; Strauss et al., 2007). This low
difficulty of items may have resulted in range restriction and
could have contributed to the lack of observed relationship
between the knowledge construct and other hypothesized
factors. J. D. Fisher and Fisher (1992) specifically caution
about this, warning that specialized knowledge in high risk
populations may make finding this relationship difficult
stating,
Finally, in some relevant populations (e.g., urban gay men who
belong to homophile organizations, college students), extant
levels of the type of knowledge measured on such ecologically
invalid instruments are extremely high, and ceiling effects make
a knowledge-prevention relationship difficult to detect.
Furthermore, it is possible that the factors as measured in
this study did not fully capture the domains of the IMB model.
For example, information was operationalized specifically as
knowledge about HCV transmission whereas the construct
has been conceptualized elsewhere as more global disease-
related knowledge. Similarly, the motivation construct was
indicated by items that centered more heavily on behavioral
intentions and less so on other domains such as social norms.
Finally, the behavioral skills items have also been operation-
alized differently in other studies in that these questions are
related to perceived behavioral control (i.e., "How sure are
you . . . ?") rather than perceived ability (i.e., "How easy
would it be . . . ?). Ultimately, the current study provides valu-
able information on the utility of the IMB model in describing
the relationships between a person's motivation, knowledge,
and behavioral skills to avoid injection risk behaviors. Other

studies have begun to examine socio-cognitive models such
as this in closer detail and even comparing models side by
side (Espada, Morales, Gullen-Riquelme, Ballester, &
Orgiles, 2016).
Implication of this work highlights the value of increasing
a person's perceived efficacy and capacity to negotiate
refusal to share needles and injection equipment. Similarly,
addressing motivation may be key to reducing injection-
related risk behaviors. Some STD and HIV interventions that
are focused on sexual behavior have already used techniques
including motivational interviews to this end with some suc-
cess (Fishbein et al., 2001; Hackler, Pinho, & McKinnon,
2013; Jaworski & Carey, 2001; Kalichman et al., 2005).
Other interventions on prevention sharing behaviors could
be developed or adapted to increase motivation and behav-
ioral efficacy to avoid risk.
