Introduction
Politicians like to claim solidarity with the people. `We are
all in this together', said the British Conservative party's
George Osborne, then shadow chancellor of the exchequer,
as he outlined a package of planned government spending
cuts and public sector pay freezes in October 2009. The
phrase would later become the defining mantra of David
Cameron's coalition government (d'Ancona, 2013).
However, the idea of being `in it together' is not only a
rhetorical device for justifying difficult decisions; it is also
an age-old principle at the heart of representative democ-
racy. The presence of some `communion of interest and
sympathy in feelings and desires' was central to Edmund
Burke's conception of `virtual representation'(Judge, 1999:
101), while James Madison in Federalist No. 57 insisted
that without a `communion of interests and sympathy of
sentiments... every government degenerates into tyranny.'
The centrality of shared experiences is also reflected in
recent scholarship about the political representation of
groups in contemporary Britain and elsewhere (Campbell
et
al., 2010; Celis and Childs, 2008; Fieldhouse and
Sobolewska, 2013; Mansbridge, 1999). Moreover, as many
politicians recognise, perceptions of solidarity are an
important reality of their own. Citizens who believe that
their leaders have different interests may punish them at the
ballot box, and may even become disenchanted with demo-
cratic processes.
This paper explores the extent to which Britons perceive
a `communion of interests'between themselves and elected
politicians in general, focusing specifically on Members of
Parliament (MPs). It further explores the relationship
between these perceptions and indicators of specific and
diffuse political support (Easton, 1975). A number of com-
mentators have suggested that Britain is witnessing the
emergence of a disconnected political class (Oborne, 2007;
Riddell, 2012). There is certainly good evidence that many
citizens perceive MPs to be elitist and remote, if not
`In it together'? The political consequences
of perceived discommunions of interest in
British politics

Abstract
The presence of shared interests between politicians and citizens is central to many accounts of political representation,
yet there has been little empirical research into how citizens perceive these interests and whether they think a
`communion of interests' exists between them and their elected representatives. Using new survey data, this paper
explores the extent to which Britons think their Members of Parliament share the same everyday experiences as
they do. It further explores the relationship between these perceptions and indicators of specific and diffuse political
support. We show that British citizens generally say that politicians are less affected by social and economic conditions
and less reliant on public services than they are. The size of this perceived `discommunion' affects voting behaviour and
satisfaction with democracy.

inhabitants of an entirely different world (Heath, 2011).
Yet, while recent research has shed light on other aspects of
public attitudes towards representation (Campbell and
Cowley, 2014a, 2014b; Cowley, 2013), little attention has
been paid to perceived common interests and, in particular,
to what extent citizens think MPs share the same everyday
experiences as they do. Capturing such perceptions is likely
to be important for scholars who wish to understand popu-
lar evaluations of political processes. If voters do not think
that politicians share their experiences, they may feel
unrepresented; they may even think that politicians are una-
ble to represent them. Drawing on new survey data, we
demonstrate the importance of this dimension of represen-
tation in Britain. We show that citizens generally say that
politicians are less affected by social and economic condi-
tions and are less reliant on public services than they are,
and that the size of this perceived `discommunion' affects
turnout, support for the incumbent government and satis-
faction with democracy.
Representation and interests
Scholarly interest in political representation has generated a
vast and varied literature. Our study is broadly concerned
with an aspect of what Pitkin (1967) terms `descriptive rep-
resentation.' This view of representation focuses on the
characteristics of representative agents, usually members of
legislative institutions. It is characterised by the notion
`that a representative body is distinguished by an accurate
correspondence or resemblance to what it represents, by
reflecting without distortion' (Pitkin, 1967: 60). Calls for
more accurate correspondences or resemblances between
citizens and political elites are frequently heard in Britain
and elsewhere. These calls are often made specifically to
help politically disadvantaged groups, notably women and
ethnic minorities, overcome adverse selection biases
(Murray, 2014; Sawer, 2000).
The `descriptive representativeness' of elected repre-
sentatives does not refer only to their visible characteris-
tics. As Mansbridge (1999: 629) points out, it can also refer
to the experiences they share with other members of the
community: thus `a representative with a background in
farming is to that degree a descriptive representative of his
or her farmer constituents.' Shared experiences are espe-
cially important because they facilitate policy responsive-
ness, or what is usually termed `substantive representation'
(Pitkin, 1967). As Mansbridge (1999: 629) goes on to note,
`shared experience... might reasonably expect to promote a
representative's accurate representation of and commit-
ment to constituent interests.' Certain visible characteris-
tics, notably gender and race, can exert a powerful influence
on a representative's ability to share experiences. For these
reasons, many scholars have concluded that descriptive
representation improves the chances of substantive repre-
sentation (Campbell etal., 2010; Mansbridge, 1999; Norris
and Lovenduski, 1995; Phillips, 1995; Schwindt-Bayer and
Mishler, 2005).
While the descriptive representativeness of political
institutions can have profound consequences, so too can
popular perceptions of the same. There is good evidence,
from Britain and elsewhere, that citizens generally want
representatives who are `like them,' either in appearance or
thought, who are local, and who have experienced what
they have experienced (Arzheimer and Evans, 2012;
Campbell and Cowley, 2014a, 2014b; Cowley, 2013;
Cutler, 2002). There is also good evidence that higher lev-
els of perceived descriptive representativeness can forge
`bonds of trust' between citizens and their representatives
(Mansbridge, 1999: 641; see also Gay, 2002); can boost the
legitimacy of political institutions (Sawer, 2000); and can
strengthen perceptions of policy responsiveness (Schwindt-
Bayer and Mishler, 2005). Yet such evidence, especially in
terms of how perceptions translate into action, generally
pertains to the perceived representativeness of politicians'
visible characteristics, not their experiences. Perceptions of
politicians' experiences, however, are also likely to shape
citizens' beliefs about representatives' abilities to promote
their interests, and are thus likely to shape citizens'satisfac-
tion with incumbent authorities and democratic processes.
In the next sections of this article, we investigate how these
issues play out in Britain.
Survey and data
To explore how British citizens think their elected repre-
sentatives' everyday experiences compare with their own,
we fielded a small battery of survey questions in an online
survey of the British adult population. The survey was
organised by the British Cooperative Campaign Analysis
Project (B/CCAP) and was administered in April 2010 by
YouGov.1 Although B/CCAP as a whole was a multi-wave
panel study, our key instruments were included in only one
wave, making our analysis essentially cross-sectional.
These instruments measured the extent to which citizens
thought both they and most MPs were affected by or expe-
rienced three distinct and important areas of public policy:
the economy, crime and public services.2 Respondents were
presented with the following questions.
Crime in Britain affects different people in different ways. To
what extent are different groups affected by crime?
Some people rely more than others on public services like
education and health. How reliant are different groups of
people on public services?
Changes in the state of Britain's economy affect people in
various ways. To what extent are different people affected
when the economic situation deteriorates?
For each question, respondents were asked to locate them-
selves on a 0­10 scale, where 0 meant they were not at all
Allen and Sarmiento-Mirwaldt 3
affected by crime or the economic situation, or were not at
all reliant on public services, and 10 meant they were very
much affected or reliant. Respondents were also asked to
locate `most MPs' on the same 0­10 scale.
The results are reported graphically in Figures 1­3.
Taken together, they suggest the existence of a perceived
discommunion between ordinary citizens and MPs across a
number of policy domains. In terms of the first domain
(Figure 1), respondents generally perceived MPs to be
affected less by crime (mean score of 3.3) than they them-
selves were (4.4). There was an even greater discommunion
with respect to the second domain (Figure 2). Respondents
generally said that they were more reliant on public services
(mean score of 5.9) than were MPs (3.4). The greatest per-
ceived discommunion between citizens and MPs was evi-
dent when we asked respondents about the economy (Figure
3). Very few respondents said that they were unaffected by a
deterioration in the economic situation, whereas many more
said that they were greatly affected (the mean score was
6.6). Many took the opposite view, however, when it came
to their elected representatives (3.4): respondents were more
likely to say that MPs tended to be less affected by

Figure 2. Public services: to what extent are you and most Members of Parliament (MPs) reliant?
4 Research and Politics 
economic downturns, and very few said MPs were very
much affected.
When interpreting the results, it is important to empha-
sise that the question explicitly refers to `most MPs' and
taps respondents' perceptions of the broader political class,
rather than specific individuals or groups of politicians.
Voters may well perceive the experiences of their own MP,
or of MPs from a particular political party, to be somewhat
different to those of MPs in general, something we are una-
ble to explore here. It is also important to emphasise that,
despite the low regard in which elected politicians are
generally held, not all respondents automatically located
most MPs at the extreme end of the scale. Figures 1­3 show
variation in MP placement, with respondents offering dif-
ferent opinions about the extent to which MPs experienced
the three policy areas.
The individual-level drivers of
perceptions
Thus, most Britons would appear to perceive a gap between
themselves and politicians with respect to how they are
affected by crime and economic downturns, and in how
reliant they are on key public services. To some extent,
these perceptions are almost certainly a product of contex-
tual factors, including prevailing economic and social con-
ditions and recent government policies. The size of any
perceived discommunion is thus likely to change over time.
While the results from our single national cross-sec-
tional survey cannot tell us much about the temporal nature
of perceived discommunions, we are able to investigate
some of the individual-level factors that drove perceptions
among British voters before the 2010 General Election.
One obvious place to begin is the notion that representa-
tives' visible characteristics are likely to have some impact
on their actual life experiences. Thus, citizens who share
the same social characteristics of most MPs may be more
likely to believe that their experiences are closer to those
of MPs--and vice versa--than individuals who least
resemble the `typical' MP. When it comes to age, gender,
education and socio-economic status, which are all factors
associated with membership of Parliament (see Cowley
and Kavanagh, 2010: 306­329), we would expect older
people, men, university graduates and those with higher
incomes to perceive a greater communion of interest
between themselves and MPs than younger people,
women, non-graduates and those with lower incomes.
Partisanship, attentiveness to politics and media consump-
tion may also be expected to affect perceptions. Individuals
who identify with the major parties may be more likely to
believe their experiences are closer to those of most MPs
than those who do not, given the integrative role of parties
and partisanship. Similarly, those who pay close attention
to current affairs may perceive a greater sense of commun-
ion with their MPs, since people who are interested in poli-
tics tend to have a stronger sense of political efficacy
(Craig etal., 1990). Meanwhile, readers of serious `broad-
sheet' newspapers may perceive their experiences to be
closer to those of MPs than `tabloid' readers, in line with
the media-malaise thesis (Newton, 2006).
To investigate these relationships, we first created meas-
ures of the perceived discommunion--or what might be
termed a respondent's sense of `in it togetherness'--for
each of the three policy areas. We focused on the magnitude
of the perceived discommunion, since this arguably matters
most in terms of politicians' capacity to be responsive.
Figure 3. Economy: to what extent are you and most Members of Parliament (MPs) affected?
Allen and Sarmiento-Mirwaldt 5
After all, politicians may be less responsive to citizens'
interests if they have less of a stake in a given policy area,
but they may also be less responsive if they have a greater
stake. Our measures were therefore of the absolute gaps
between where respondents located themselves on the rel-
evant 0­10 scale and where they located most MPs. The
distributions of the resulting `gaps' are shown in Figure 4.
As can be seen, and in line with Figures 1­3, the crime
`gap' and thus the scale of the perceived discommunion in
this domain was the smallest (mean score of 2.4). The econ-
omy gap (4.0) was the largest of the three, with the public
services gap (3.3) in the middle.
We then created a composite discommunion scale,
which was simply the arithmetic mean of the crime, public
services and economy gaps. This three-item scale had a
Cronbach's alpha of 0.74, indicating good reliability. We
then used this 0­10 scale, where a low score reflects a
smaller gap and a high score reflects a greater gap, as a
dependent variable in an analysis of what drives respond-
ents' perceptions of a discommunion of interests between
themselves and most MPs. Because of the way we con-
structed the dependent variable, a negative coefficient
means that the relevant variable reduces the scale of the
perceived discommunion, whereas a positive sign indicates
that this variable increases it.
While our primary interest is investigating the magni-
tude of the perceived discommunion, we also recognise
that the direction of perceptions may matter.As Figures 1­3
suggest, most citizens take the view that MPs are more
sheltered from the everyday challenges that they have to
grapple with, and it is these citizens who can be expected to
have the most pronounced concerns about a distant and
unrepresentative political class. To explore the importance
of direction as well as magnitude, we created a second
variable based on the positive gap between respondents'
self-perceptions and perceptions of most MPs: after sub-
tracting the latter from the former, we excluded the nega-
tive scores before creating another three-item 0­10 scale.3
The resulting variable provided a measure of how much
more respondents thought they were affected by crime and
economic downturns than MPs were, and how much more
reliant on public services they thought they were.
The results of our analyses are reported in Table 1. Both
the `absolute' and `positive' models are very similar in
direction and statistical significance. Among the independ-
ent variables, age was significant insofar as younger
respondents, contrary to expectations, perceived a smaller
discommunion than middle-aged ones, whereas the percep-
tions of those over the age of 54 were not statistically dif-
ferent from those of middle-aged respondents. Graduates
and richer people (those earning over £40K) also perceived
a smaller gap, in line with expectations. Those who paid
more attention to politics, here measured on a four-point
scale, perceived a larger gap, a relationship that went
against what we anticipated. Newspaper readership was not
significant. As for partisanship, respondents who identified
with Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats
believed the gap to be smaller, but only for those who iden-
tified with the Labour Party was the coefficient significant
(p < 0.05) in both models. Still, this finding suggests that
partisanship continues to integrate citizens into political
processes, as anticipated.

with voting behaviour. As illustrated by the 2010 coalition
government's narrative of being `in it together,' politicians
are conscious that citizens' perceptions of mass-elite soli-
darity may have electoral consequences. We were able to
examine whether this was so in the context of the 2010
General Election, thanks to the multi-wave panel-design of
the B/CCAP: all respondents who participated in the April
2010 wave were also polled in June 2010. We were thus
able to relate citizens' pre-election perceptions to their
reported turnout and vote choice.
We expect a greater sense of discommunion to suppress
turnout, in much the same way that a low sense of external
efficacy does (Clarke etal., 2004). Voters who have less
confidence in the system's ability to respond to them are
less likely to vote; voters who think their MPs enjoy very
different experiences to them may think them less able or
willing to be responsive. We also anticipate that, among
citizens who do vote, a greater sense of discommunion is
likely to reduce support for the incumbent party, in line
with the standard `reward­punish' model of voting behav-
iour (Clarke etal., 2009). In addition to these anticipated
relationships between the magnitude of perceived discom-
munion and voting behaviour, we also expect the direction
of perceptions to matter: respondents who say most MPs
are much less affected by economic and social conditions
than they themselves are, as opposed merely to enjoying
different experiences than their MPs, will be even less
likely to vote or support the incumbent party.
To test these expectations, we included both our `abso-
lute'or magnitude measure and our `positive'or directional
measure of perceived discommunion, together with a num-
ber of controls, in two multivariate models: a model with
the dependent variable of reported turnout, a simple dummy
variable where 1 means the respondent did vote; and a
model with the dependent variable of reported vote choice,
a dummy variable where 1 means that the respondent
recalled voting for the incumbent Labour party. Our control
variables include age, sex, education and income, party
identification, newspaper readership, political attentiveness
and retrospective evaluations of the national economy, a
key indicator of government `performance' (Clarke etal.,
2004, 2009).
Table 2 reports the results of our first two models. When
it comes to reported turnout at the 2010 General Election,
perceptions of both an absolute and a positive gap depressed
the chances that a respondent would vote, but only in the
latter case was this effect large enough to be statistically
significant. This finding is consistent with our expectation
about the additional importance of the direction of any per-
ceived discommunion. In both models, political attentive-
ness increased turnout, as one would expect: people who
followed daily affairs were more inclined to vote than those
who did not. Age also mattered: those under 35 were less
likely to vote than older groups, conforming to well-known
patterns of voting behaviour. When it comes to explaining
vote choice, both the magnitude and the direction of per-
ceived discommunion were significant and negatively
signed: people who thought MPs were further removed
from their experiences in absolute terms were more likely
to vote against the government, and those who thought MPs
were less affected by economic and social conditions were
even more likely to vote this way. Among the other varia-
bles, a perception that the national economy had deterio-
rated made a vote for the incumbent party less likely, while

Labour identifiers were significantly more likely to vote
Labour, and Conservative identifiers were less likely to
vote Labour, although the last relationship was significant
only in the magnitude model.
While there is evidence that a sense of discommunion is
a factor in aspects of voting behaviour, perceptions of
mass-elite solidarity may also have other political conse-
quences. In particular, such perceptions can be expected to
affect levels of diffuse support for the political system
(Easton, 1975). We explored this possibility by examining
the relationship between perceptions of discommunion and
satisfaction with democracy, as measured on a four-point
scale, ranging from 1 (`not at all satisfied') to 4 (`very satis-
fied'). In essence, we expect a greater sense of discommun-
ion to be associated with lower levels of satisfaction with
democracy: respondents who think politicians are consist-
ently not `in it together' with them may feel that the system
is failing at a basic level. Once again, we further expect this
effect to be more pronounced among respondents who said
MPs are much less affected by a range of economic and
social conditions than they themselves are.
In contrast to our models of turnout and voting Labour,
the direction of causality is more difficult to establish with
absolute certainty. However, it is far more likely that
respondents' relatively specific perceptions--in this
instance of their own and most MPs' experiences of crime,
the economy and public services--affect a general sense of
satisfaction with democracy, rather than the other way
round. There may, however, be some confounding factors,
such as a general sense of disengagement or disillusion-
ment with elected politicians, which may account for both
respondents' perceptions of most MPs' experiences and
their satisfaction with democracy. In order to mitigate this
potential problem, we controlled for political attentiveness
and perceptions of elected politicians'standards of honesty,
measured on a scale from 1 (`very low') to 5 (`very high').
Table 3 presents the results.
The table shows that, even after controlling for these
influences, perceptions of a discommunion of interests had
a significant and negative impact on satisfaction with
democracy: people who perceived a greater discommunion
were less likely to express satisfaction with democracy; the
relationship was marginally greater in the directional
model. Among the control variables, those who identified
with one of the three mainstream parties, and especially
Labour and the Conservatives, were more likely to express
higher levels of satisfaction with democracy. Those who
felt that the national economy had deteriorated were less
likely to express satisfaction. Attentiveness was negatively
signed in both models, meaning that respondents who paid
more attention to politics were likely to express satisfaction
with democracy, perhaps because they were more familiar
with recent scandals, but this relationship was only signifi-
cant in the second model. Those who perceived politicians

to be honest were more likely to express higher levels of
satisfaction in both models.
To illustrate the impact of different variables on satisfac-
tion with democracy, Figure 5 displays the impact of the
magnitude of perceived discommunion (`absolute gap') on
the likelihood of expressing different levels of satisfaction
with democracy, holding all the other variables constant at
their mean (or, for the dummy variables, their median), as
logged odds are difficult to interpret. The graph suggests
that the likelihood of being `very satisfied' with democracy
was low, but there was a slight downward trend: as percep-
tions of a discommunion increased in size, satisfaction with
democracy decreased. The reverse was true for the likeli-
hood of being `very dissatisfied,' which increased with an

increasing perceived discommunion. The chances are that
someone was `fairly satisfied' with democracy decreased
dramatically as the sense of discommunion grew. The prob-
ability of expressing `a little' satisfaction increased quite
substantially as perceptions of a discommunion increased
from a small gap to a medium-sized one. Thus, Figure 5
illustrates the effect that a sense of discommunion has on
satisfaction with democracy, even after controlling for
potentially confounding factors such voters' disengage-
ment and mistrust of politicians.
Conclusion
At a time when many citizens appear to feel alienated from
established political processes, it is important to identify
what it is about politics that people dislike. We would not
go so far as to say that a perceived discommunion of inter-
ests is absolutely fundamental to any explanation of con-
temporary political disaffection, but we do suggest that it is
part of the story, and that it is also relatively neglected fea-
ture of public opinion that merits further inquiry. There are
certainly good reasons to think that liberal democracies
need communions of interest, perceived as well as real,
between their politicians and citizens. Shared experiences
and interests help politicians respond better to popular pref-
erences. Knowing that politicians face the same experi-
ences and challenges may also boost citizens'confidence in
their elected representatives. As we have shown in the case
of Britain, the greater the perceived communion, the greater
the sense of satisfaction with democracy. There is also evi-
dence that perceptions of shared experiences and interests
can affect voting behaviour, irrespective of performance
evaluations--in this instance whether to turn out to vote,
and whether to support or oppose an incumbent party.
The findings presented in this paper are, of course, lim-
ited in time and space. It is unclear how typical Britain is of
other liberal democracies in terms of its pronounced mood
of not-in-it-togetherness, and the effects of these beliefs on
diffuse and specific support. It is also unclear whether the
responses we measured in 2010 were above or below the
historical mean in Britain. Moreover, our data prevent us
from exploring whether citizens perceive a greater com-
munion with specific representatives, in particular their
own local MP, than the political class in general. Further
research is clearly needed to explore the spatial and tempo-
ral dynamics of these beliefs, and how they are shaped by
economic, social and institutional factors. Further research
is also needed to explore the relationship between percep-
tions, on the one hand, and aspects of politicians' behav-
iour, such as constituency service, and social characteristics,
such as gender and professional backgrounds, on the other.
Knowing more about these dynamics and relationships may
help us understand better the current political disenchant-
ment in Britain and in other liberal democracies. As we
have demonstrated in this article, it matters if citizens think
they and politicians really are `in it together'.

Notes
1. See the appendix for details of the survey methodology. On
the validity of online surveys, see Sanders etal. (2007) and
Twyman (2008).
2. With the exception of foreign affairs and immigration, the
questions cover those issues that were consistently `the most
important'in the years immediately prior to the 2010 General
Election (Allen, 2011: 16).
3. Excluding negative scores reduced the number of respond-
ents by 154 for the crime gap, 107 for the public services gap
and 90 for the economy gap, and by 163 for the composite
scale. The `positive' scale had an Alpha of 0.76.
