Introduction
Hepatitis C (HCV) is a significant public health problem,
affecting more than 123
million people globally (Global
Burden of Disease Working Group, 2004). In Australia, a
country of approximately 22
million, it is now estimated
that 310,000 people have been exposed to HCV and over
200,000 people are living with chronic HCV (Kirby
Institute, 2013). The primary route of transmission of HCV
in the developed world is through sharing of equipment
used to inject drugs (Razali et al., 2007). The Australian
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter Aboriginal
Australians) population, which comprises 3
per cent of
Australia's population, is overrepresented in both the prev-
alence of HCV and incidence of newly reported HCV
infections (Maher et al., 2007). It was estimated in 2008
that around 16,000 Aboriginal Australians were chronically
infected with HCV, representing around 8.3per cent of the
total Australian population living with chronic HCV at the
time. More recent research has indicated that the preva-
lence of HCV among Aboriginal Australians may be much
higher than previously estimated. As of 2011, the rate of
newly diagnosed HCV in the Aboriginal population was
142 per 100,000 compared to 40 per 100,000 among the
non-Aboriginal population (Kirby Institute, 2012).
As a group,AboriginalAustralians face a number of disad-
vantages on a range of health and socio-economic outcomes
which may place them at risk of acquiring HCV. On a global
scale,Aboriginal people have poorer health than non-Aborig-
inal people, which is associated with poverty, malnutrition,
and infection and is exacerbated by inadequate healthcare and
health promotion (Gracey and King, 2009). Often disadvan-
tages faced by Aboriginal Australians are a result of unequal
access to the same opportunities as non-Aboriginal
Australians, such as access to education, employment, and
healthcare. Additionally, many of these disadvantages are
compounded for Aboriginal Australians living in rural and
remote areas of the country (Hunter, 2007). Health and social

Abstract
This research assessed whether greater attachment to an Aboriginal community buffers against the negative effects
of stigma and promotes positive health outcomes. Aboriginal Australians (n
=
203) living with hepatitis C completed a
survey assessing community attachment, stigma, resilience, quality of life, treatment intent, hepatitis C knowledge and
positive lifestyle changes. A stronger sense of community attachment was associated with greater resilience, increased
quality of life, less hepatitis C­related stigma and with increased lifestyle changes after diagnosis. Hence, community
attachment can buffer against the negative health effects of stigma and may promote the resources to engage in positive
behaviour changes, ultimately increasing long-term health outcomes.

issues faced byAboriginalAustralians include poverty, home-
lessness, and mental illness, which may all be linked to the
higher prevalence of HCV among Aboriginal compared with
non-Aboriginal Australians. A further issue to consider is the
cumulative toll and intergenerational effects of trauma related
to the colonisation of Australia by White settlers. Research in
Canada has found a direct link between incidence of HCV
infection and having at least one parent attend a residential
school (Craib et al., 2009). For Australian Aboriginal com-
munities, the forced removal of children from families (The
Stolen Generation), the dispossession of lands and repression
of cultural practices, protocol and language, and other racist
governmental policies can be read in parallel to the Canadian
experience and as contributing to ongoing, trans-generational
trauma (Atkinson, 2002).
The numerous hardships which Aboriginal people have
and continue to experience has also led to an overrepresen-
tation of Indigenous people within priority populations
identified by the Australian national HCV strategy
(Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing,
2010), people who inject drugs (PWID) and people in custo-
dial settings. Although the prevalence of injecting drug use
specifically amongAboriginalAustralians is not well known
(AustralianInstituteofHealthandWelfare,2006;Kratzmann
et al., 2011), available research suggests that it is high (Day
et al., 2003; Iversen et al., 2013). For example, between
2008 and 2012, the proportion of Aboriginal Australians
who participated in the Australian Needle and Syringe
Program Survey, which annually recruits over 2000 partici-
pants, ranged from 11 to 12
per cent (Iversen et al., 2013).
The Pharmacy Needle and Syringe Survey conducted in
New South Wales reported an even higher proportion of
Aboriginal participants, with 15­20
per cent of the sample
identifying as Aboriginal in the surveys conducted between
2006 and 2008 (Bryant et al., 2010). Additionally, 16
per
cent of the participants recruited nationally in the 2012
Illicit Drugs Reporting System who reported injecting drugs
identified as Aboriginal (Stafford and Burns, 2013).
Research has shown that Aboriginal status is associated
with an earlier onset of injecting drug use and increased like-
lihood of sharing injecting equipment, placing Aboriginal
Australians at a greater risk of acquiring blood borne virus
such as HCV (Correll et al., 2000; Paquette et al., 2012; Ward
et al., 2011). It may be that the increased likelihood of shar-
ing unsterile injecting equipment among Aboriginal groups
could be linked to cultural practices, such as shared use of
possessions with kin (Correll et al., 2000; Larson et al.,
1999). As reciprocity may be an important cultural value,
Aboriginal people may consequently feel obliged to share
equipment with close relations (Van der Sterren and
Anderson, 2002). Research also indicates that Aboriginal
Australians may be less knowledgeable about blood-borne
virus transmission than the general community, due to lim-
ited access to health education especially forAboriginal peo-
ple residing in rural and remote areas (Paquette et al., 2012).
While there is a treatment for HCV, uptake remains
globally low (Grebely et al., 2009; Iversen et al., 2013).
Research indicates that 3000­4000 people living with HCV
receive treatment annually in Australia (Grebely et al.,
2009). These numbers are small because of the numerous
deterrents to HCV treatment, which include side effects, the
rigorous nature of treatment, and the impact of treatment on
work and family (Doab et al., 2005; McNally et al., 2006;
Wilson et al., 2010). Additionally, people with HCV may
face competing health and social concerns that impede their
access to care and treatment, including poverty (Edlin et al.,
2005; McNally et al., 2006), unemployment, lack of stable
housing (Edlin et al., 2005; Grebely et al., 2008) and
comorbidity such as mental health problems (Weiss et al.,
2012). Given the social and economic disadvantages expe-
rienced by Aboriginal Australians, these barriers could be
exacerbated (Hunter, 2007). Additionally, individuals may
not be psychologically ready to engage with the relatively
arduous nature of HCV treatment; hence, adopting positive
lifestyle changes such as reducing alcohol consumption,
reducing illicit drug use, increasing medical visits and
increasing exercise have been found to be important for the
management of chronic HCV (Hickman et al., 2002;
Sladden et al., 1998). In a recent study of people living with
HCV who attended a community HCV clinic in New
Zealand, Horwitz et al. (2012) found over 70 per cent of
respondents made lifestyle changes to better manage their
illness and therefore were more capable of coping with the
long-term consequences of their infection. Preventing pro-
gression of HCV is particularly important in the Aboriginal
community, where the life expectancy is lower than the
general national average and where lack of preventative
care and excessive alcohol consumption are common, fur-
ther exacerbating liver damage (Battersby et al., 2008; Pink
and Allbon, 2008).
As with many minority groups of Indigenous status,
being of Aboriginal descent may carry a particular stigma
in Australia. Goffman (1963) defines stigma as a trait or
characteristic that is deeply disreputable to an individual or
a group of people. Stigmatised people are labelled as differ-
ent and structures are put in place to protect the majority
from the discrediting attribute (Crocker et al., 1998). Parker
and Aggleton (2003) further explain stigma as a means to
reinforce social power. This is accomplished by marking
and establishing social inequalities through the use of
boundaries or `norms', such as ethnicity, gender, sexuality
and socio-economic status (Scrambler, 2006; Simbayi
et al., 2007). Feelings of stigmatisation are likely to be
compounded for Aboriginal people who have a history of
injecting drug use and are living with HCV because they
may experience multiple or layered stigma (Henkel et al.,
2008; Rao et al., 2008).
Stigma becomes discrimination when thoughts, beliefs
or attitudes evolve into direct action against the stigmatised
group (Giddens, 2009). A large body of research has shown
Brener et al. 3
that stigma has a negative effect on the health and well-
being of those who are stigmatised. Feelings of stigmatisa-
tion have been linked to poor mental health, poverty, low
social status, physical illness, low self-esteem and aca-
demic underachievement (Allison, 1998; Clarke et al.,
1999; Crocker and Major, 1989; Link and Phelan, 2006;
Major and O'Brien, 2005). Furthermore, experiencing
stigma or discrimination has been shown to adversely affect
the health-seeking behaviours of people living with a stig-
matised condition such as HCV (Ahern et al., 2007; Butt,
2008; Pascoe and Smart Richman, 2009). However, stig-
matised individuals have also been found to function as
well as people who are not stigmatised, despite experienc-
ing stigma and discrimination (Miller and Kaiser, 2001).
Thus, the consequences of belonging to a stigmatised group
are not always negative. Miller and Kaiser (2001) suggest
that stress associated with stigma will only be detrimental if
the individual does not have the resources to cope with that
stress. One factor that can buffer or protect individuals
from the negative effects of stigma is a strong sense of
minority group belonging or community attachment
(Branscombe et al., 1999; Phinney, 1996; Sellers et al.,
2003; Sellers and Shelton, 2003). Yet aside from research
noted above which focuses on African American racial
identity and community attachment, little empirical
research has assessed the impact of attachment to a minor-
ity group for other stigmatised groups. This study helps
address this gap by establishing the role of Aboriginal com-
munity attachment in determining health outcomes associ-
ated with HCV for Aboriginal people who are HCV
positive. We hypothesise that greater attachment to partici-
pants' Aboriginal community will serve a protective func-
tion for people who are living with HCV. Specifically, those
with stronger attachment to their Aboriginal community
will show greater psychological resilience, will be less
affected by stigma and discrimination based on their
Aboriginal or HCV status and will report a better quality of
life. We further predict that individuals with stronger com-
munity attachment will be better able to cope with their ill-
ness, enabling them to make important positive lifestyle
changes to better manage their health.
Methods
Sample and recruitment
The main recruitment strategy was the distribution of
recruitment postcards in a range of health service across
New South Wales known to either specifically target
Aboriginal people (e.g. Aboriginal Community Controlled
Health Services) or mainstream services that attract a large
number of Aboriginal clients (e.g. needle and syringe pro-
grammes or liver clinics in areas where there many
Aboriginal people live), at community health events and
through community contacts. Recruitment postcards were
designed to look similar to advertising postcards often found
in cafes, libraries and movie theatres. The cards did not
mention injecting drug use or HCV, but rather asked if peo-
ple had problems with their liver. A toll free number was
included to allow individuals to contact the Aboriginal
Liaison Officer, free of charge, to receive further informa-
tion about the study and, if eligible, book a suitable time to
complete the telephone survey. Services displayed postcards
in the waiting room where there were other health promo-
tional pamphlets and booklets. Other recruitment strategies
included placing a one-page advertisement in a community
publication for injecting drug users and one-page poster in a
newsletter for drug and alcohol workers. To participate in
the research, individuals had to be over 18years old, identify
as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and report currently
living with HCV, undertaking treatment or recently clearing
the virus naturally or through treatment.
Procedure
Potential participants called the toll-free number and spoke
with the Aboriginal Liaison Officer. The Aboriginal Liaison
Officer informed participants about the study aims, assessed
their eligibility and assured them of the confidentiality of the
survey. Informed consent was obtained from participants by
them verbally agreeing to complete the survey. The survey
was conducted telephonically and participants were offered
the opportunity to be surveyed by either an Aboriginal or
non-Aboriginal researcher. Participants' responses were
entered into a computer software programme. The survey
took on average 30­40
minutes to complete. The research
team also visited some mainstream and Aboriginal services
to complete surveys with clients in person. These surveys
were administered in hard copy by an interviewer to ensure
uniformity in survey administration. Hard copies of the
survey were then entered into the computer manually.
Survey participants were reimbursed AUD30. The study
was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of
the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council,
UNSW Australia and relevant health authorities.
Measures
The broader survey examined participants' quality of care in
relation to HCV, engagement with HCV-related services,
management of HCV and choices around HCV treatment.
The survey also investigated knowledge of HCV, contact with
HCV health promotion, quality of life, resilience and experi-
ences of stigma and discrimination. A number of pre-existing
measures were used to examine these focal areas, some of
which have previously been used in research with Aboriginal
people. Pre-testing was undertaken to identify problems with
question content, misinterpretation of individual terms or
concepts and problems with the survey design. Items used
specifically for this analysis are outlined below.
4 Health Psychology Open 
Aboriginal community attachment.A measure of attachment
to an Aboriginal community was developed based on three
items assessing how much the respondent felt they belonged
to their Aboriginal community, how much they felt they
had in common with their Aboriginal community and how
much they interacted with their Aboriginal community.
These items were similar to those used in Brener et al.
(2013) assessing the group-based attachment of people liv-
ing with HIV. Responses were scored on 4-point scale from
`not much' to `a lot', with higher scores indicative of a
greater sense of Aboriginal community attachment. The
items were summed to create an Aboriginal community
attachment scale (=.86).
Stigma measures.A modified version of the Group-Based
Medical Mistrust Scale (Thompson et al., 2004) was used
to investigate racially based stigma and discrimination in
healthcare. This scale consisted of 12 items and the face
validity of the items was assessed by the research team
which included three Aboriginal researchers. Additionally,
the term `Aboriginal' was substituted for the term `people
of my ethic group' (e.g. `I feel that Aboriginal people are
not treated the same as people of other groups by doctors
and healthcare workers'). Items were scored on a 5-point
scale from `very dissatisfied' to `very satisfied', where
higher scores reflected greater perceived cultural stigma
and discrimination (=.92).
Perceived hepatitis C stigma was measured using an
18-item scale based on previous scales used to measure
stigma perceived to be associated with HIV (e.g. `Most
people believe I am dirty because I have hepatitis C';
Brener and Von Hippel, 2008). Items were scored on a
5-point scale from `strongly disagree' to `strongly agree'
with higher scores indicative of greater experiences of per-
ceived HCV-related stigma (=.92)
Perceived HCV-related discrimination and exclusion in
the healthcare sector was examined using items modified
from previous research (Brener et al., 2013). The scale con-
sisted of eight items assessing participants'experience with
healthcare workers in relation to their HCV (e.g. `they are
careful not to touch me'). Items were scored on a 5-point
scale from `not at all'to `an extreme amount'(=.89), with
higher scores indicating greater perceived discrimination
from health workers in relation to HCV.
HCV knowledge.As individuals living with HCV need to
have knowledge about their illness in order to understand
the benefits of making positive lifestyle changes, it was
important to assess participants' HCV knowledge. Partici-
pants responded to 16 items regarding the natural history,
transmission, testing and treatment of HCV. Items were
either multiple-choice or true/false questions. Participants'
correct responses were summed together to create a knowl-
edge score that ranged from 0 to 16, where a higher scored
represented greater HCV knowledge.
Quality of life.To establish participant feelings about the
quality of their life, they were asked a single-item question,
`How would you rate your quality of life' and answered on
a 5-point scale from very poor to very good.
Resilience. Psychological resilience was measured using the
10-item Connor­Davidson Resilience Scale (e.g. `I believe
coping with stress strengthens me'; Connor and Davidson,
2003). Items were scored from `not true at all' to `true
nearly all of the time' with higher scores indicative of
greater resilience (=.92).
Treatment intent.Treatment intentions were measured by
asking participants whether they were planning to go on
HCV treatment in the future. Participants chose from one of
four response categories including, in the next 12months,
in the next 1­2years, not for at least 2years and that they
never intended to undergo treatment. Higher scores on this
item indicated that participants were less inclined to show
intent to go on treatment in the near future, with the highest
score of 4 indicating no treatment intent.
Health lifestyle changes as a result of HCV diagnosis.Partici-
pants were asked whether they had made particular lifestyle
changes as a result of finding out that they were HCV posi-
tive (Horwitz et al., 2012). The list consisted of six behav-
ioural changes all important in the management of HCV
(i.e. changed your diet, reduced or cut out alcohol, increased
exercise, had more regular HCV check-ups, reduced or cut
out illicit drug use, accessed information about HCV care
and treatment). Reponses to these items were 1 `yes' and 0
`no'. The items were summed together to form a behaviour
change scale, whereby a higher score represented greater
behavioural change.
Demographics.Participants were asked a range of demo-
graphic questions including whether they were of Aboriginal
or Torres Strait Islander background, where their community
was from, age, gender, living arrangements, education,
employment, history of incarceration and sexuality.
Sample demographics
A total of 203 respondents who self-reported currently liv-
ing with HCV, undertaking treatment or recently clearing
the virus naturally or through treatment participated in this
study. Just over half of the sample was male with one par-
ticipant identifying as transgender (Table 1). The majority
of the sample identified as Aboriginal, seven participants
stated they were of bothAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
background. The mean age of the sample was 28
years
(standard deviation (SD)
=
9.6
years). Of the total sample,
88
per cent were receiving government financials or assis-
tance and just over 80per cent of the sample had ever been
in prison. See Table 1 for additional demographics.
Brener et al. 5
Results
The means, standard deviation, inter-quartile range and
Cronbach's alpha of all scaled items are reported in Table 2.
Pearson's product moment correlation was used to deter-
mine whether an association existed between Aboriginal
group belonging and HCV knowledge, group-based
Medical mistrust, perceived HCV stigma, perceived HCV-
related discrimination and exclusion, quality of life, resil-
ience, HCV-related behavioural lifestyle changes and HCV
treatment intensions. As can be seen in Table 3, Aboriginal
community attachment was associated with a range of out-
come variables. Those who perceived themselves as being
more attached to their Aboriginal community reported less
perceived HCV stigma and less perceived HCV-related
discrimination and exclusion from healthcare workers.
Furthermore, they showed greater resilience and reported
greater quality of life. Greater attachment to an Aboriginal
community was also associated with increased lifestyle
changes after their HCV diagnosis. On the other hand,
HCV knowledge, HCV treatment intentions, age, education
and gender were not associated with attachment to an
Aboriginal community.
Correlational analysis was also used to establish factors
associated with healthy lifestyle changes as a result of
HCV diagnosis. Significant variables included HCV
knowledge, HCV treatment intent, gender, education and
as previously mentioned Aboriginal community attach-
ment. Hence, having greater HCV knowledge, showing
more intent to go onto HCV treatment in the future, being
female, completing more education and reporting greater
identification with an Aboriginal group was associated
with greater lifestyle changes after HCV diagnosis.
Lifestyle changes following HCV diagnosis were not asso-
ciated with the three stigma items nor with resilience, qual-
ity of life or age.

To assess whether Aboriginal community attachment
remained an independent predictor of adopting healthier
lifestyle changes following an HCV diagnosis, a hierarchi-
cal linear regression was conducted. Specifically, the out-
come variable, lifestyle changes following HCV diagnosis,
was regressed on the predictor variables which were sig-
nificantly associated with lifestyle changes in the univariate
analysis (i.e. Aboriginal community attachment, HCV
knowledge and HCV treatment intentions). As can be seen
in the regression analysis (Table 4), after controlling for
gender and education, showing future intent to go on HCV
treatment and having greater HCV knowledge both predict
greater lifestyle changes. Significantly, feelings of attach-
ment to an Aboriginal community remained independently
associated with healthier lifestyle changes related to HCV
over and above HCV knowledge and HCV treatment intent.
Discussion
The results of this study highlight the importance of
Aboriginal community attachment as related to positive
health outcomes among this sample of Aboriginal people
living with HCV. As the data illustrate, those who report a
stronger sense of attachment to an Aboriginal community
also report a greater sense of resilience, increased quality of
life and less stigma associated with both HCV and within
the healthcare sector generally. A strong sense of group
identity may possibly act as a buffer against the negative
health consequences of being part of a group that is racially
discriminated against and who also live with a stigmatised
illness through positive associations with that racial or eth-
nic minority group (Branscombe et al., 1999; Phinney,
1996; Sellers et al., 2003; Sellers and Shelton, 2003).
Indeed, Sellers and Shelton (2003) argue, it is not just group
belonging but the meaning ascribed to that group that
shapes how people are able to respond and can provide a
positive frame of reference for stigmatised individuals.
Having a strong belief in the cultural values and ideologies
of a minority group can therefore lead to positive associa-
tions with this group (Sellers and Shelton, 2003) and may
provide the resources which enable the individual to both
cope with stress associated with a chronic illness and make
positive changes in their lifestyle to better their health
(Miller and Kaiser, 2001). This possibility is further evi-
denced in the increase in reported resilience associated with
greater Aboriginal community attachment among this sam-
ple, and personal resilience is well known to increase the
ability to cope with an illness (Edward and Warelow, 2005;
Farber et al., 2000; Kralik et al., 2006).
The most significant finding in relation to Aboriginal
community attachment is the association with the impor-
tant reported outcome of engaging in behaviours which
increase healthier lifestyles after HCV diagnosis. Having
the motivation to change behaviours in order to ensure a
healthier lifestyle especially in relation to HCV (i.e.
decreased alcohol consumption and decreased illicit drug
use), as well increasing exercise and visits to the doctor, are
particularly important in reducing the progression of HCV
(Hickman et al., 2002; Sladden et al., 1998). In fact, within
this sample, 83
per cent had not had HCV treatment.
Therefore, establishing factors that increase positive
changes in health behaviours in order to reduce the impact
of this disease may reach a larger proportion of those
affected with HCV than treatment ­ especially given struc-
tural constraints around HCV treatment such as long wait-
ing lists and other deterrents like treatment side effects
(Doab et al., 2005; McNally and Latham, 2009).
Additionally, the association between increased lifestyle
changes and treatment intentions may also suggest that
those who make significant lifestyle changes have the
resources and the motivation to take on HCV treatment in
the future.

Literature on the impact of stigma and discrimination on
health and well-being of stigmatised minority groups tends
to focus on negative outcomes, particularly that stigma
contributes to and exacerbates the effects of an illness
(Scrambler, 2006). While this research is not suggesting
that Aboriginal people with HCV do not feel stigmatised in
relation to both their Aboriginal status and their HCV posi-
tive status, what it may show is that being part of a cohesive
cultural/ethnic group and identifying strongly with that
group may have positive health outcomes as evidenced in
the increase of healthy behaviours among those who are
more strongly attached to their Aboriginal community.
Hence, the findings from this research appear to indicate
that not only does community attachment buffer the indi-
vidual from negative health consequences as can be seen in
recent HIV research (Brener et al., 2013) but may actually
promote the means or the motivation to engage in positive
behaviour changes including less alcohol and illicit drug
use, which will ultimately result in better long-term health
outcomes for people living with HCV.
The study has some limitations which must be noted.
While it is the largest known sample of Aboriginal people
living with HCV, it is a convenience sample and the incor-
poration of sufficient numbers of participants from rural
and remote Aboriginal communities in the state was diffi-
cult to achieve. Additionally, the results described are
largely based on associations between the key outcome
variables of Aboriginal community attachment and/or
healthy lifestyle changes and the other predictor variables.
However, the findings in this study of the significance of
Aboriginal community attachment and the importance that
it may have on health outcomes associated with HCV
clearly indicates the need for further research in this area.
Despite the noted limitations, the findings of this study
have some important implications for designing HCV
health promotion interventions for Aboriginal Australians
and for other Indigenous groups. The evidence of the
importance of Aboriginal group belonging in promoting the
health lifestyle changes suggest that health intervention
strategies around HCV should focus on strategies to
acknowledge, build and reinforce community attachment.
A sense of community belonging is an important source of
positive identification for many marginalised groups as is
shown in this study. Within this framework, an understand-
ing of the difficulties and trauma which Aboriginal people
have been exposed to and the link to risk practices associ-
ated with HCV (Craib et al., 2009) should be highlighted
along with the resilience which these communities have
shown in maintaining their community attachments
(Atkinson, 2002). Hence, HCV-integrated care and treat-
ment models that incorporate important aspects of belong-
ing and attachment for Aboriginal community members in
this instance could be developed which include a partner-
ship between HCV services and Aboriginal community-
controlled health services, peer support or patient navigator
programmes and healthy liver programmes (including
HCV testing and assessments). These should be based in
Aboriginal community settings or in mainstream services
that promote engagement of the target community and spe-
cifically foreground or make apparent the centrality of
Aboriginal culture in service delivery. Such models are
likely to be effective for many Indigenous communities in
promoting best health outcomes especially in the case of a
stigmatised illness such as HCV.
