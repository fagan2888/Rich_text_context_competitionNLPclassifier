Objective: To determine the association between re-
ported concurrent visual and hearing impairment and risk
of mortality.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Annual cross-
sectional multistage area probability surveys of the US ci-
vilian noninstitutionalized population living at ad-
dressed dwellings were conducted by the National Center
forHealthStatistics,Hyattsville,Md.Mortalitylinkagewith
theNationalDeathIndexofparticipantsfrom1986to1994
was performed through 1997. Complete reported visual
andhearingimpairmentdataandsurvivalstatuswereavail-
able for 116 796 adults aged 18 years and older. A total of
3620 participants reported visual impairment only, 12 330
reported hearing impairment only, and 1461 reported con-
current visual and hearing impairment.
Main Outcome Measure: Risk of mortality.
Results: Mortality linkage identified 8949 deaths with
an average follow-up of 7.0 years. After controlling for
survey design, age, marital status, educational level, self-
rated health, and number of nonocular and nonaudi-
tory conditions, white participants and "other-race" par-
ticipants, but not African American participants, reporting
concurrent visual and hearing impairment had signifi-
cantly increased risk of mortality in comparison with their
counterparts reporting no impairment (white partici-
pants: hazard ratio [HR]=1.23, 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.04-1.46 for men and HR=1.63, 95% CI, 1.37-
1.93 for women; African American participants: HR=1.50,
95% CI, 0.94-2.40 for men and HR=0.92, 95% CI, 0.51-
1.63 for women; participants of other races: HR=2.47,
95% CI, 1.33-4.57 for men and HR=2.23, 95% CI, 1.01-
4.90 for women). Risk of mortality was generally greater
for participants reporting concurrent impairment as com-
pared with that for participants reporting either visual
impairment alone or hearing impairment alone.
Conclusions: IntheUnitedStates,whitepersonsandthose
of other races, but not African American persons, report-
ing concurrent visual and hearing impairment have an in-
creased risk of mortality. Reported concurrent impair-
mentisanindependentpredictorofmortalityamongwhite
persons and those of other races for both men and women.

VISUAL AND HEARING IMPAIR-
ment increases with age
and occurs commonly
among older persons. Of
persons aged 70 years or
older, 18% report blindness in 1 or both
eyes or some other trouble seeing, 33% re-
port hearing problems, and 9% report both
visual and hearing problems.1 Despite no-
table improvements in the treatment of
ocular and auditory diseases in the last 2
decades, there is no evidence that visual
or hearing impairment rates reported by
adults are declining.2,3 With the aging of
the US population, the number of per-
sons with multiple sensory impairments
is increasing, and the morbidity and mor-
tality associated with concurrent visual and
hearing impairment are likely to become
an increasing public health concern. For
example, combined declines in vision and
hearing are associated with decreased qual-
ity of life,4 imbalance,5 and falls.6 Func-
tional status, measured by activities of daily
living and instrumental activities of daily
living scores, is diminished in elderly per-
sons with concurrent visual and hearing
loss as compared with those with single
sensory impairment.7-9 Furthermore, an in-
creased risk of mortality among adults with
eye diseases such as glaucoma, retinopa-
thy, and cataracts has been described.10-18
Visual impairment has also been found to
be independently associated with re-
duced survival after controlling for the
presence of a disabling eye disease.11,13,19
Information on the association between
hearing impairment and increased risk of
mortality is also available but lim-
ited.8,20,21 To date, only 1 large-scale study8

has examined the association between concurrent vi-
sual and hearing impairment and the risk of mortality.
In this study of 5444 adults aged 55 to 74 years from the
1971 to 1975 National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tionSurveyafteradjustmentfordemographicsandchronic
conditions, compared with those without impairment,
the risk of mortality with a mean follow-up of 10.1 years
was similar for participants with measured concurrent
visual and hearing impairment (relative risk [RR]=1.10,
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-1.89), for those with
measured visual impairment only (RR=1.20, 95% CI,
1.02-1.42), and for those with measured hearing impair-
ment only (RR=1.12, 95% CI, 0.88-1.44). In the same
analysis, the risk of mortality was also similar for par-
ticipants with self-reported concurrent visual and hear-
ing impairment (RR=1.08, 95% CI, 0.69-1.69), for those
with self-reported visual impairment only (RR=1.10, 95%
CI, 0.95-1.27), and for those with self-reported hearing
impairment only (RR=0.86, 95% CI, 0.65-1.12). Even
with a relatively large cohort (n=5444), the number of
participants with concurrent visual and hearing impair-
ment at baseline was small, with only 36 participants hav-
ing measured concurrent impairment and 64 partici-
pants having self-reported concurrent impairment.8
The purposes of the present study are to examine the
association between reported concurrent visual and hear-
ing impairment and risk of mortality in a large represen-
tative sample of the US noninstitutionalized adult civil-
ian population and to compare this risk with that of
reduced survival associated with reported visual impair-
ment only or reported hearing impairment only.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION AND DESIGN
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is conducted an-
nually by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Hy-
attsville, Md.22 The NHIS uses a complex sample survey design
to obtain, in a cost-effective manner, population samples that are
representative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized popula-
tion. Households are selected annually from 192 of the approxi-
mately1900primarysamplingunits(primarilycountiesorasmall
number of contiguous counties) that cover the 50 states and the
District of Columbia. Small clusters of households are drawn at
random annually from these primary sampling units. A strati-
fiedapproachisusedtoensureanoversamplingofAfricanAmeri-
can persons and, in 1992, Hispanic persons.
Each year, nearly 50 000 households are selected to partici-
pate in the NHIS (a half sample of households was drawn in 1986
owing to budgetary restrictions). Information is obtained annu-
ally from approximately 120 000 family members using a pri-
mary household respondent, with all of the adults at home par-
ticipating in the interview. The primary household respondent
provides information for children residing in the household and
for adults residing in the household who are not present at the
interview. Throughout the survey years of 1986 to 1994, the re-
sponse rate ranged between 94% and 98%.23
During the period from 1986 to 1994, information on visual
impairment, hearing impairment, and selected ocular and audi-
tory diseases was obtained annually in a randomly derived, one-
sixth sample of households already selected for the NHIS. Par-
ticipants were asked to name conditions and impairments that
were related to the following: (1) activity limitation in the pre-
vious 2 weeks and the previous 12 months; (2) health care vis-
its in the previous 2 weeks; and (3) hospital stays in the previ-
ous 12 months. A series of standardized questions was used to
detail the name, characteristics, cause, onset, and effects of each
described condition and impairment.24,25 Trained medical cod-
ers used this information to generate an International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) code for each condi-
tion.24,26 Except in 1986, the visual and hearing questions were
administered to approximately 14000 to 15000 adults each year.
In most cases, the participants themselves answered all of the
questions (61%-63% across survey years), and for the remain-
ing participants, the responses were obtained from their rela-
tives or other proxies. For simplicity in the present study, self-
or proxy-reported data are referred to as "reported." Complete
visual and hearing reported data and survival status were avail-
able for 116 796 adult participants of the NHIS in 1986 to 1994
who were aged 18 years or older at the time of the household
interview. The average number of adults per household partici-
pating in the survey was 1.85.
DEFINITION OF REPORTED CONCURRENT
VISUAL AND HEARING IMPAIRMENT
Concurrent visual and hearing impairment was defined as re-
porting both visual impairment and hearing impairment. For vi-
sualimpairment,participantswereaskedtoindicatewhetherthey
or any family members had "blindness in 1 or both eyes" and
"any other trouble seeing with 1 or both eyes even when wear-
ing glasses." Modified ICD-9 codes were used by the NCHS to
classify visual impairment as follows: (1) blind in both eyes;
(2) visual impairment in both eyes; (3) blind in one eye and vi-
sually impaired in the other; and (4) blind or visually impaired
in one eye only, with good vision or vision not mentioned in the
other. In the present analyses, participants falling into catego-
ries 1 through 4 were grouped into a single reported visual im-
pairment category. For hearing impairment, participants were
asked to indicate whether they or any of their family members
were "deaf in 1 or both ears" or "had any other trouble hearing
with 1 or both ears." Modified ICD-9 codes were used by the
NCHS to classify hearing impairment as follows: (1) deaf in both
ears; (2) hearing impairment in 1 or both ears; (3) deaf in one
ear and hearing impairment in the other; and (4) deaf or hear-
ing impairment in 1 ear only (with good hearing or hearing not
mentioned in the other ear).26,27 In the present analyses, partici-
pantsfallingintocategories1through4weregroupedintoasingle
reported hearing impairment category.
DEFINITION OF COVARIATES
Covariates included age, sex, race, marital status, educational
status, self-rated health, and the number of nonvision- and
nonhearing-related health conditions. Race was coded as Af-
rican American, white, and other races (which included
Aleut, Eskimo or American Indian, Asian or Pacific Islander,
multiple races, and unknown or not specified). Marital status
was coded as either married or other. Educational status was
coded as less than the 12th grade, completion of high school
(or General Education Diploma equivalent), and more than a
12th-grade education. Health status indicators included a
general question assessing health status as excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor. In the NHIS, a condition count was
generated for any acute condition, chronic condition, or im-
pairment. In the present analysis, ICD-9 and impairment
codes were used to exclude from these counts conditions as-
sociated with the visual and auditory systems (ICD-9 codes
360-368, 370-379, 380-387, 388.0, 388.1, 388.3-388.8, X00-
X09). A 3-category nonvision and nonhearing health condi-

tion variable was then created as follows: (1) no conditions;
(2) 1 condition; and (3) 2 or more conditions.
MORTALITY LINKAGE
Information was collected by the NCHS to perform a mortal-
ity follow-up through linkage with the National Death Index.
Information was obtained on the date and underlying cause of
death. The latter was recoded and reported using ICD-9.26 The
mortality linkage for participants of the 1986 to 1994 NHIS sur-
vey years is complete through December 31, 1997, with an av-
erage follow-up of 7.0 years.28 We used the binary variable (as-
sumed alive, assumed dead) provided by NCHS to classify
participants' survival status. This classification was based on
the matching algorithm developed by the NCHS that assigns a
numerical value indicating the probability of a "true" match
based on information recorded on the death certificate and col-
lected during the survey (eg, social security number, full name,
sex, birth month, birth year). This algorithm was developed
and tested in previous NCHS mortality linkage studies; the NCHS
estimates that use of the recommended cutoff values for the mor-
tality linkage will correctly classify more than 97% of NHIS de-
cedents and more than 99% of NHIS nondecedents.
ANALYSIS
All of the analyses were completed using the Software for the
Statistical Analysis of Correlated Data package to account for
the complex sample survey design of the NHIS.29 Software for
the Statistical Analysis of Correlated Data takes into account
that data from individuals participating in such survey de-
signs are not independent since both clusters of households and
clusters of participants are selected into the sample. The NCHS
generated sample weights for each NHIS participant for use in
all of the design-adjusted analyses. These weights take into ac-
count the probability of selection into the sample, household
nonresponse to the interview, and poststratification adjust-
ments designed to make the sample more representative of the
US population. To account for the aggregation of data over mul-
tiple survey years, these sample weights were modified in the
present analysis by dividing the original weight by 9, the num-
ber of years combined.30 To compare proportions and to as-
sess associations between nominal variables, 2 analyses were
used. Cox regression analyses were performed using the Proc
Survival procedure in Software for the Statistical Analysis of
Correlated Data. Hazard ratio (HR) estimates and the corre-
sponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported.
RESULTS
Table 1 provides frequency and prevalence rates of re-
ported hearing, visual, and concurrent visual and hear-
ing impairment among participants stratified by socio-
demographic characteristics. Of the 116 796 adult
participants,3620(3.1%)reportedvisualimpairmentonly,
12 330 (10.6%) reported hearing impairment only, and
1461 (1.3%) reported concurrent visual and hearing im-
pairment. Male, older, and less-educated participants were
more likely to report impairment. Among racial groups,
participants in the other-races group reported the least
visual, hearing, and concurrent impairment, and Afri-
can American participants reported less hearing impair-
ment as compared with white participants.
Table 2 presents the sociodemographic characteris-
tics, reported health status, reported number of nonocu-
lar and nonauditory conditions, and reported impairment
status of study participants with and without available sur-
vival status information. Owing in part to the large sample
size, all of the 2 tests comparing the distribution of these
measures by available survival status were statistically sig-
nificant (Table 2). Participants who were older, not mar-
ried, and in the other-races group were more likely to lack
survival status information. The age and sex distributions

were similar in the 2 survival status categories, as were the
distributions of level of education and age-adjusted re-
ported health status. Compared with participants without
available survival status, participants with available sur-
vival status had slightly higher percentages of reported vi-
sual, hearing, and concurrent impairment.
Table 3 shows the mortality HRs and the correspond-
ing 95% CIs stratified by race and sex subgroups for all
of the self- and proxy-reported study participants. These
race- and sex-specific analyses were necessary because
prior analyses of risk of mortality revealed significant in-
teractions of concurrent reported visual and hearing im-
pairment with race as well as sex. After controlling for
the complex sample survey design, age, marital status,
educational level, self-rated health, and the number of
nonocular and nonauditory conditions, the HRs for par-
ticipants with concurrent reported visual and hearing
impairment in comparison with those with no reported
impairment remained significant for all of the white, other-
race, and sex subgroups but not for African American men
or women. The HRs for those reporting concurrent im-
pairment were higher than for those with reported vi-
sual impairment only or hearing impairment only for men
of all of the race subgroups and for white women.
Table 4 shows the mortality HRs and the correspond-
ing 95% CIs stratified by race and sex subgroups includ-
ing only the 63% of NHIS participants who were inter-
vieweddirectly,excludingtheproxy-reportedparticipants.
The HR estimates for the self-reported study partici-
pants only were similar and, generally, slightly lower when
compared with estimates for all of the participants pre-
sented in Table 3. The differences between the HRs for
all of the participants vs self-reported participants only
were all less than 0.27, except for African American men.
For example, the HRs for white men and white women
with reported concurrent visual and hearing impair-
ment interviewed directly were 1.16 and 1.55, respec-
tively, and the HRs that included both self- and proxy-
reported responses were 1.23 and 1.62, respectively
(Table 3). The HR for African American men with re-
ported concurrent visual and hearing impairment inter-
viewed directly was 0.96, compared with an HR of 1.50
when including both self and proxy responses (Table 3);
the 95% CIs of neither of these HRs were significant.

rent visual and hearing impairment is an independent pre-

dictor of mortality for both white men and white women.
This finding was present but not significant in African
American men, and it does not hold for African Ameri-
can women. For white men, white women, and African
American men, but not for African American women, the
risk of mortality related to reported concurrent visual and
hearing impairment is higher than the mortality risk as-
sociated with either reported visual impairment only or
hearing impairment only. In comparison with white per-
sons and African American men, African American women
had the highest HR for mortality risk associated with re-
ported visual impairment only and the lowest HR asso-
ciated with reported hearing impairment only, but these
HRs were not significantly different from those of white
persons and African American men. The reasons for these
findings are not clear. A stronger association between re-
ported visual impairment and increased risk of all-cause
mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality exists for
women as compared with men.13 However, sex-specific
mortality risk associated with reported hearing impair-
ment has not been previously examined in a large-scale
study to our knowledge. In the current study, compared
with those with no reported visual or hearing impair-
ment, white women with reported hearing impairment
only had a slightly higher mortality risk than their male
counterparts. In contrast, among African American per-
sons, this sex difference was reversed: African American
women with reported hearing impairment only had a
slightly lower mortality risk than their male counter-
parts. Further research is needed to clarify the relation-
ship between mortality risk and dual or single sensory
impairment.
There are several advantages to the use of the NHIS.
The NHIS is designed to be representative of the US popu-
lation;onlyinstitutionalizedandmilitarygroupshavebeen
omitted from direct sampling. Survey response rates were
excellent (ie, 95%-98%), and determination of survival
status was available for more than 96% of the partici-
pants. Aggregating data over 9 survey years allowed for
the identification of more than 3700 participants with
reported visual impairment, more than 12 800 with
reported hearing impairment, and nearly 1500 with re-
ported concurrent visual and hearing impairment, mak-
ing this analysis the largest mortality study to date, to
our knowledge, to examine associations between re-
ported dual impairment and mortality.
Few previous studies have examined the associa-
tions between risk of mortality and concurrent visual and
hearing impairment owing in part to the relatively large
number of participants required for meaningful results.
In the aforementioned National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey study of 5444 adults aged 55 to 74 years
from 1971 to 1975, only 36 participants had clinical evi-
dence of concurrent visual and hearing impairment.8 In
another study of 1408 participants aged 65 years and older,
the risk of mortality after 1 year, in comparison with those
without impairment, was similar for participants with con-
current visual and hearing impairment (RR=1.18, 95%
CI, 0.54-2.60), for those with visual impairment only
(RR=1.34, 95% CI, 0.69-2.61), and for those with hear-
ing impairment only (RR=1.30, 95% CI, 0.56-3.03).31 This
study also had low statistical power given that only 15
participants had concurrent impairment. Because of the
lack of statistical power, sex- and race-specific analyses
were not possible in these previous studies.
In the present analyses, the greatest risk of mortality
associated with reported concurrent visual and hearing
impairment was found in participants of the other-race
subgroup. This mixed group consisted of Asian or Pa-
cific Islander (49%), American Indian (15%), and mul-
tiple and other (36%) races. Men and women of other
races with reported concurrent impairment had signifi-
cantly higher risk of mortality as compared with those
with no impairment (men: HR=2.47, 95% CI, 1.33-
4.57; women: HR=2.23, 95% CI, 1.01-4.90). These find-
ings suggest that further research in multiple sensory im-
pairment should include races other than white and
African American to determine why persons of other races
with concurrent impairment have higher mortality risk.
Severalmechanismshavebeenpostulatedtoaccountfor
associations between sensory impairment and mortality.
These mechanisms include (1) exposure to factors known
toincreasetheriskofsensoryimpairmentandmajorcause-
specific deaths (eg, cardiovascular disease), (2) aging, and
(3) impaired psychosocial functioning.
Numerous studies have found eye disease to be asso-
ciated with reduced survival, even after controlling for
cardiovascular and other risk factors.11,15-19,32-36 In the pres-
ent analyses, significant reduction in survival is associ-
ated with reported concurrent visual and hearing impair-
ment in white persons, even after controlling for all of the
covariates, including the number of nonocular and non-
auditory conditions. Taken together, these findings sug-
gest that exposure to factors known to increase the risk of
sensoryimpairmentandcause-specificmortalitycannotfully
account for the associations between concurrent visual and
hearing impairment and reduced survival.

Associations between sensory impairment and re-
duced survival as a reflection of poor health or acceler-
ated aging have been postulated.10,33,35,37,38 Self-rated
health,10 which is itself a predictor of reduced survival
in numerous studies, including the NHIS,39,40 was in-
cluded in the present multivariate statistical models as a
partial control for overall health status. However, sen-
sory impairment also contributes to the self-rated health
assessment, and whether sensory impairment serves as
a marker of generalized cellular aging is not certain.41
Associations between sensory impairment and mor-
tality could be mediated by changes in psychosocial func-
tioning. Visual impairment has been shown to increase
the risk of impaired activities of daily living,36,42,43 de-
pression,43,44 and social isolation.21 Hearing impairment
is associated with increased social isolation45 and depres-
sion.46,47 These functional status indicators are them-
selves associated with either reduced overall survival or
increased risk of cause-specific mortality.48-50
The present study has several limitations. The NHIS
does not annually assess important risk factors, includ-
ing smoking status, which is associated with disabling
eye conditions such as cataract. The NCHS has never pub-
lished a study that validated reported chronic condi-
tions against standardized, physician-confirmed diag-
noses. Owing to the self- or proxy-reported nature of
ascertainment of all of the ocular and auditory condi-
tions in the NHIS, there is likely some misclassification
of reported visual and hearing impairment. In a study of
570 persons aged 50 years and older, questions related
to visual acuity were found to have a sensitivity of ap-
proximately 82% and a specificity ranging from 87% to
89%.51 However, visual acuity, contrast and glare sensi-
tivity, stereoacuity, and visual fields are significant in-
dependent risk factors for self-reported visual disability
in the elderly, and visual acuity alone is not the only di-
mension of subjective visual disability.52 Agreement be-
tween self-reported hearing loss and pure-tone air-
conduction audiometry has a sensitivity ranging from 76%
to 93% and a specificity ranging from 56% to 82%.53-56
Differences between reported impairment and clini-
cal measures may be owing in part to interpersonal
variations in feelings and adaptations to physical dis-
abilities. This interpersonal variation is taken into ac-
count in our analysis by controlling for self-rated health
in our model because self-rated health itself is related to
risk of mortality and reflects the physical and mental
state of the person.39
Only a few standardized visual and hearing impair-
ment questions were administered in the NHIS. How-
ever, respondents who reported impairment were then
asked a series of questions to determine whether they had
discussed the condition with their health care provider,
whether their health care provider assigned a diagnosis
or named the condition, and whether the impairment af-
fected the left, right, or both sides. These questions were
also asked whenever sensory conditions or impairment
were mentioned earlier in the interview. Medical coders
used this information to determine the level of impair-
ment. Therefore, determination of impairment in the NHIS
is unique when compared with other self-reported indi-
ces of sensory function in which single items or a stan-
dardized series of items are used to determine the pres-
ence and extent of impairment.
Validation studies conducted by the NCHS and others
suggest that proxy reports lead to slightly lower preva-
lence estimates of chronic conditions when compared with
reportsobtaineddirectlyfromrespondents.57,58 Inthisstudy,
the prevalence rates of concurrent visual and hearing im-
pairment for proxy-reported participants were consis-
tently lower than those for self-reported participants, with
differences ranging from 0.1% to 1.5%. To address this po-
tential limitation of misclassification of impairment, we re-
peated our mortality analyses including only the 63% of
NHISparticipantswhowereintervieweddirectly(Table4).
In general, the exclusion of proxy-reported participants de-
creased the mortality HRs slightly but did not alter the con-
clusion of this study. Further, the exclusion of proxy ob-
servations generally led to larger 95% CIs for the HR
estimates and resulted in a sample less reflective of the US
community-residing adult population than the NHIS was
designedtoobtain.Thesefindingsneverthelesssuggestthat
the inclusion of proxy reports in the mortality analyses did
not lead to systematic bias of the HR estimates for all of
the NHIS participants (Table 3).
To summarize, after controlling for survey design, age,
marital status, educational level, reported health status,
and number of nonocular and nonauditory conditions,
reported concurrent visual and hearing impairment is an
independent predictor of mortality for both white men
and white women and for men and women in the other-
races category, but not for African American men or Af-
rican American women. Furthermore, for white men and
white women, the risk of mortality related to reported
concurrent impairment is higher than the mortality risk
associated with either reported visual impairment or hear-
ing impairment only.
