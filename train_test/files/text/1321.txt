Abstract
We use two surveys to describe the demographic and attitudinal correlates of being in
"Living Apart Together" (LAT), cohabiting, and marital relationships for heterosexuals,
lesbians, and gay men. About one third of U.S. adults not married or cohabiting are in
LAT relationships ­ these individuals would be classified as "single" in conventional
studies that focus on co-residential unions. Gay men are somewhat more likely than
heterosexual men to be in LAT relationships. For heterosexuals and lesbians, LAT
relationships are more common among younger people. Heterosexuals in LAT unions
are less likely to expect to marry their partners, but more likely to say that couples
should be emotionally dependent than are cohabiters. Regardless of sexual orientation,
people in LAT relationships perceive similar amounts of emotional support from
partners, but less instrumental support than cohabiters perceive.

1. Introduction
"Living Apart Together" (LAT) relationships are gaining visibility in Western countries
among scholars and the general public (ABC News 2006, Brooks 2006, Casper et al.
2008, Haskey and Lewis 2006, Levin 2004). LAT unions are intimate relationships
between unmarried partners who live in separate households but identify themselves as
part of a couple. These relationships are sometimes referred to as "non-residential
partnerships" (Castro-Martín, Domínquez-Folgueras, and Martín-García 2008).
Reasons for forming LAT relationships are diverse and are likely to vary across
the life course (Beaujouan, Regnier-Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008). Some young
couples may intend to marry, but live apart due to the constraints of school and the
labor market (Levin and Trost 1999). Others form non-residential partnerships as part
of the dating process; typically, these unions involve less long-term commitment. In
older age, individuals may choose to live apart from their partners to facilitate contact
with adult children from previous unions and to maintain privacy and autonomy (de
Jong Gierveld 2004, Karlsson and Borell 2002). Individuals in LAT relationships
themselves may be uncertain about what their relationship means (Castro-Martín,
Domínquez-Folgueras, and Martín-García 2008).
In addition to life course variation in the reasons for forming LAT relationships,
there also may be differences by sexual orientation. Lesbians and gay men may live in
separate households to maintain privacy about their relationship, to facilitate an
egalitarian partnership, or to foster intimacy while remaining self-sufficient (Peplau and
Cochran 1990, Weston 1997). Sharing a residence might also be a less defining feature
of same-sex relationships because childrearing is less common among same-sex couples
(Black, Sanders, and Taylor 2007).
New data, such as from the Generations and Gender surveys, are accumulating to
describe LAT relationships in Europe (Vikat et al. 2007), but U.S. data on non-
residential partnerships remain very limited. Most U.S. surveys solely collect data on
couples who live together, which prevents researchers from distinguishing individuals
who are single from those in LAT unions. The dearth of data on LAT relationships in
the United States is matched by the limited national data on couple relationships among
lesbians and gay men. The most widely used national data on same-sex couples come
from the U.S. census, which cannot identify individuals in unmarried non-residential
partnerships, regardless of sexual orientation. The U.S. census also lacks information
about sexual orientation that would allow researchers to compare single lesbians and
gay men to those in unions.
Motivated by the limited data on LAT unions in the United States, and especially
among lesbians and gay men, we address three questions in this paper: Who is in a non-
residential union and are these relationships more common among lesbians and gay
Demographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 179
men than among heterosexual women and men? What are the attitudes and values of
individuals in non-residential unions? Finally, what emotional and instrumental benefits
are LAT relationships likely to provide when compared to the benefits individuals
receive when they live with a partner? We use data from the 1996 and 1998 General
Social Surveys supplemented by data on lesbians, gay men, and heterosexual women
and men from the 2004-05 California Quality of Life Survey I.
We begin by contextualizing the rise of non-residential partnerships in Western
countries, describing variation in LAT unions, summarizing U.S. research about LAT
relationships, and considering the potential importance of LAT relationships among
lesbians and gay men. The next sections describe our data, methods, and results. We
conclude by speculating about the significance of LAT relationships for contemporary
family life, as well as considering the conceptual and methodological issues that must
be addressed to learn more about LAT unions in the United States.
2. Background
2.1 Living apart together and the Second Demographic Transition
The label "Living Apart Together" challenges the longstanding assumption of most
Western demographic research that two people must live in the same household to be
considered a couple.5 Sharing a residence signals commitment, facilitates the sharing of
expenses and work of daily life, and fosters intimacy. Individuals in LAT unions,
however, also treat the relationship with their partner as important and identify as being
part of a couple even though their partner lives in a separate household (Bawin-Legros
and Gauthier 2001, Haskey and Lewis 2006). LAT relationships appear to be part of the
Second Demographic Transition, which marked a change in the demography and
meaning of couple relationships in Western societies. These changes include the rise in
sexual relationships outside of marriage, increases in non-marital cohabitation, and high
rates of divorce ­ the behavioral manifestations of a long-term normative shift toward
individualism and egalitarianism (Lesthaeghe 1995, van de Kaa 1987). Although the
Second Demographic Transition is characterized by a decline in lifelong marriages, the
rise of non-marital cohabitation suggests that individuals are not rejecting partnerships
per se. They still seek significant intimate relationships, but not necessarily marriage or
relationships that involve sharing a household.
5In contrast, "visiting" unions in non-Western cultures have long been recognized (e.g., Ariza and de Oliveira
2001, Gough 1959).
Strohm et al.: "Living Apart Together" relationships in the United States
180 http://www.demographic-research.org
Demographers' attention to cohabitation might have increased the salience of the
distinction between being a part of a couple and living together, and thus indirectly
fostered new data collection on LAT relationships (Bawin-Legros and Gauthier 2001).
These emerging data show that in a wide range of countries there are small but
significant percentages of people who have LAT partners (Beaujouan, Regnier-Loilier,
and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008, Caradec 1996, Castro-Martín, Domínquez-Folgueras, and
Martín-García 2008, de Jong Gierveld 2004, Haskey 2005, Haskey and Lewis 2006,
Kiernan 2000, Levin 2004, Milan and Peters 2003). For example, using data from the
Fertility and Family Surveys, Kiernan (2000, Table 3.3) finds that the prevalence of
LAT relationships among women 20-39 years old who have never married or cohabited
ranges from 32% in France to 47% in Switzerland. Notably, non-residential unions
occur in settings in which cohabitation is institutionalized, such as in northern Europe
(Levin 2004, Levin and Trost 1999), as well as in southern Europe where cohabitation
is relatively uncommon (Castro-Martín, Domínquez-Folgueras, and Martín-García
2008, Kiernan 2002). Thus high levels of cohabitation are not necessary for the
occurrence of LAT unions.
2.2 Variation in living apart together unions
Estimates of the prevalence of non-residential partnerships vary, suggesting that stage
in life, attitudes, social and economic constraints, and cultural context affect the
formation and stability of non-residential partnerships (Castro-Martín, Domínquez-
Folgueras, and Martín-García 2008, Haskey 2005, Kiernan 2002). Young people are
more likely to be in LAT relationships than are older people (Beaujouan, Regnier-
Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008 for France, Haskey 2005 for Britain, Milan and
Peters 2003 for Canada). Compared to those who are older, young people in LAT
relationships are more likely to live with other adults, often their parents (Haskey
2005). Young people are also more likely to expect to live with their partner in the
future (Beaujouan, Regnier-Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008, Milan and Peters
2003), suggesting that LAT relationships among the young are often a step on the
pathway to cohabitation or marriage. In addition, education distinguishes those in non-
residential and co-residential unions: Individuals in LAT unions are likely to have more
schooling than those who live with their spouse or a cohabiting partner (Castro-Martín,
Domínquez-Folgueras, and Martín-García 2008 for Spain, Haskey and Lewis 2006 for
Britain).
Qualitative evidence from Europe is consistent with quantitative findings about life
course variation in the reasons for LAT relationships. Interview data suggest that
middle-aged and elderly people view living apart together as a way to balance aspects
Demographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 181
of a shared, intimate life with autonomy and independence in taking care of children or
older parents (Haskey and Lewis 2006, Levin 2004). In older age, those who form LAT
unions may do so to remain in a long-held residence or to stay near family and friends
instead of moving in with their partner (de Jong Gierveld 2004, Levin 2004).
In-depth interviews indicate that divorced persons may prefer non-residential
partnerships because they are reluctant to give up their autonomy and want to avoid
falling into habits that they associate with their previous relationship (Haskey and
Lewis 2006, Levin 2004, Levin and Trost 1999). Previously married women in Haskey
and Lewis' (2006) study also explained their decision to live apart from their intimate
partner as an effort to achieve greater gender equity in the division of household work.
The expressed goals of autonomy, personal fulfillment, and a more egalitarian
relationship reinforce the claim that LAT unions are part of the Second Demographic
Transition's normative change in the value and meaning of couple relationships
(Bawin-Legros and Gauthier 2001, Surkyn and Lesthaeghe 2002).
Intimate partners also may live apart due to economic constraints rather than
choices (Kiernan 2002). In a recent French study almost three fifths of individuals in
LAT relationships said they were living apart from their partner because of
circumstances out of their control, such as financial pressures (Beaujouan, Regnier-
Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008, Table 8). Economic constraints are likely to differ
across the life course; Beaujouan, Regnier-Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp (2008) find
that young adults are much more likely than those who are older to say that financial
constraints are the reason they are in a LAT relationship. For young people who live
with their parents, transitioning from a LAT union to a co-residential union is costly
because it requires sufficient economic resources to relinquish the intergenerational
transfers associated with living with parents (Castro-Martín, Domínquez-Folgueras, and
Martín-García 2008). Labor market opportunities, housing costs, and partners'
economic circumstances affect young people's ability to move in with a partner. These
economic factors are akin to those that affect marriage decisions among cohabiting
couples (Smock, Manning, and Porter 2005). In contrast, for older persons who have
already established independent households and have greater economic security, the
transition from a LAT union to a co-residential union may be guided more by lifestyle
choices, such as a desire to preserve autonomy.
2.3 Non-residential partnerships in the United States
Information about non-residential partnerships in the United States is much more
limited than in Europe and Canada. In its earliest incarnation, U.S. research on non-
residential partnerships focused on married couples who were living apart in
Strohm et al.: "Living Apart Together" relationships in the United States
182 http://www.demographic-research.org
"commuter marriages" (Gerstel and Gross 1984). Commuter marriages are uncommon;
only 3.1% of married persons are "married, spouse absent" to use Census Bureau
parlance (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2006). Rindfuss and Stephen (1990) use data on
young adults to show that marriages are more likely to break up when spouses do not
live together. At least for married couples who live apart, the state of being in a non-
residential partnership may be short-lived.
More recent U.S. efforts to study non-residential partnerships adopt the European
focus on non-marital unions, as we do in our study. These studies find that most non-
marital LAT relationships are also of short duration. Binstock and Thornton (2003) use
cohabitation histories for White young adults to examine transitions between living
with a partner, periods of separation, and then returns to a shared home. They find
relatively high rates of movement between co-residential partnerships and what they
infer are non-residential partnerships. Other research investigates non-residential unions
among parents to assess the stability of children's contact with fathers. Data from the
Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing project, a U.S. birth cohort study of parents and
their young children, show that only 14% of parents in a "romantically involved but
living apart relationship" were still living apart one year later (Carlson, McLanahan,
and England 2004: 245). There are no U.S. studies to our knowledge that investigate the
prevalence or characteristics of non-residential partnerships for a broader age range and
for both parents and non-parents.
2.4 Sexual orientation and LAT relationships
There also has been very little research on non-residential partnerships among lesbians
and gay men in the United States. In fact, demographic research on same-sex couples is
even more limited by data availability than is research on heterosexual couples (Casper
et al. 2008). However, theory and data exist which provide possible insights about LAT
relationships among lesbians and gay men. The same normative changes associated
with the Second Demographic Transition contributed to greater approval of
heterosexual cohabitation and fostered more acceptance of homosexuality and same-sex
couple relationships. For example, individuals in cultural settings that emphasize the
value of self-expression are more accepting of homosexuality (Adamczyk and Pitt
2009). In an environment that encourages autonomy and personal fulfillment, lesbians
and gay men are likely to form LAT unions for the same reasons that heterosexuals do ­
to balance desires for intimacy and personal autonomy or because of economic
constraints.
Despite growing acceptance of homosexuality and same-sex unions, there is still
considerable stigma associated with homosexuality and same-sex relationships (Loftus
Demographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 183
2001, Peplau and Fingerhut 2007). For example, approximately half of American adults
in 2003 reported a "mostly unfavorable" or "very unfavorable" opinion of lesbians and
gay men (Pew Research Center 2003). Policies also limit the opportunities of same-sex
couples. For example, same-sex couples cannot marry in most U.S. states and cannot
adopt or foster children in some states (Gates et al. 2007).
This social context is likely to make non-residential partnerships more attractive to
lesbians and gay men than to heterosexual women and men. Stigma may increase the
desirability of forming a LAT relationship because non-residential partnerships keep
sexuality more private than does moving in together (Peplau and Cochran 1990, Steven
and Murphy 1998). Two other factors may contribute to a higher prevalence of non-
residential unions among lesbians and gay men compared to heterosexuals. First,
individuals' expectations that part of being a couple includes sharing a household may
be much stronger for heterosexual unions than for same-sex unions. An example of the
emphasis on co-residence for heterosexual unions includes major theories of family life
developed by Parsons (1943) and Becker (1981, 1991), both of which focus on
heterosexual couples who live with children. Because lesbians and gay men are less
likely than heterosexuals to express interest in having children (Gates et al. 2007), and
because same-sex couples are less likely to have children (Black, Sanders, and Taylor
2007), sharing a residence may be a less salient feature of same-sex than heterosexual
unions. Second, if LAT relationships facilitate an egalitarian division of labor (Haskey
and Lewis 2006), and if gay men and lesbians are more likely than heterosexual women
and men to seek equality in their intimate relationships (Kurdek, 2005) then LAT
unions may be more common among gay men and lesbians than among their
heterosexual counterparts.
The recent article by Carpenter and Gates (2008) presents some insights on the
prevalence and demographic correlates of LAT unions among self-identified lesbians
and gay men in the United States. Their article focuses on how lesbians and gay men
who register as domestic partners differ from people whose partnerships are not
registered with the State. Using data from the 2003 California LGBT Tobacco Survey,
Carpenter and Gates (2008, Table 3) find that 11% of lesbians and gay men 18 to 59
years old are in non-residential partnerships. These non-residential partnerships are of
shorter duration than cohabiting unions, especially for lesbians. The Tobacco Survey
results also show that lesbians in non-residential unions are younger than are lesbians
who are living with their partner and than their single counterparts, but among gay men
there is little or no difference in mean age by union status.
In addition, Carpenter and Gates (2008) find that lesbians and gay men differ in
the association between education and whether or not they live with their partner.
Lesbians in non-residential partnerships are less likely to have completed college than
are cohabiters, but for gay men college completion and type of partnership appear
Strohm et al.: "Living Apart Together" relationships in the United States
184 http://www.demographic-research.org
unrelated. Because the younger adults in the Tobacco Survey sample may still be
enrolled in school, it is unclear if the gender difference is due to differences in the
timing of LAT relationships in lesbians' and gay men's lives, or to differences in how
education affects union status. We build on the work of Carpenter and Gates (2008) by
comparing lesbians and gay men with heterosexual women and men who are likely to
have completed their educations, examining perceived support from LAT partners
compared to support from residential partners, and investigating the demographic
correlates of being in a non-residential union within a multivariate context.
3. The present study
We begin by describing how individuals in LAT unions differ demographically from
married, cohabiting, and single people. We examine a variety of demographic
characteristics initially, but later focus on three that are not ­ or are unlikely to be ­
influenced by union status: age, education, and race-ethnicity. Next, we shed light on
what heterosexual women and men in LAT unions may be seeking in their relationships
by examining union status differences in attitudes about work, individualism, and
gender roles. These attitudes provide suggestive evidence on the extent to which people
form LAT unions out of a desire to combine individualism with companionship.
Although these attitudes can be both causes and consequences of a person's union
status, studying the attitudinal correlates is a useful way to determine whether those in
LAT unions are more like cohabiters or single people. We also examine whether
heterosexuals in cohabiting and LAT unions expect to marry their partner. These
expectations provide insight into the extent to which living apart together is a precursor
to marriage. Finally, we describe the potential benefits of LAT unions for lesbians, gay
men and heterosexual women and men by examining how much emotional and
instrumental support individuals in marital, cohabiting, and LAT unions perceive from
their partners.
3.1 Data
We use data from two complementary population-based data sources, one a national
sample and the other a state sample. The national data source is the U.S. General Social
Survey (GSS) from 1996 and 1998. The GSS consists of cross-sectional, multistage
probability samples of the non-institutionalized adult population of the United States.
Demographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 185
The GSS is rare in its inclusion of questions about non-residential partnerships
addressed to adults in a broad age range.6 GSS interviews were conducted face-to-face
in English and had response rates of about 76% in both years (National Opinion
Research Center 2007, Table A.6). We combine the two years when possible to increase
the number of individuals in cohabiting and LAT relationships. We restrict the analysis
sample to adults age 23-70. The younger age boundary is to reduce the chance that
respondents are still in school, and the older age boundary is to match the cut-off for the
second dataset we use (described in the next paragraph). We weight the GSS data to
adjust for differential selection by household size and for survey non-response, and use
the svy procedures in Stata 10 to adjust for the complex sampling design of the GSS.
The sample for the first part of the analysis is 3,584 respondents (1,863 in 1996 and
1,721 in 1998) who were in the random subsamples of the GSS survey that included the
question about LAT status. This sample excludes 66 cases with missing data on the
relationship status or socio-demographic questions. The sample sizes in the second part
of the analysis, which examines attitudes and values, vary because the GSS asked some
questions only of random subsamples.
We supplement the GSS data with data from the 2004-05 California Quality of
Life Survey I (Cal-QOL, Cochran and Mays 2007). The Cal-QOL is a population-based
sample of lesbians, gay men, and heterosexual women and men in California. It
includes a measure identifying those in LAT relationships and assesses respondents'
perceptions of support from their relationship partner. The Cal-QOL is a follow-back
survey conducted in English and Spanish that interviewed individuals who originally
participated in the 2003 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). The 2003 CHIS is
a computer-assisted telephone survey of a multistage probability sample of the non-
institutionalized California population.7 When weighted, the CHIS data are
representative of the adult population of California living in households.
At the conclusion of the CHIS interview, respondents were asked if they were
interested in participating in future surveys. The Cal-QOL attempted to re-interview
every CHIS respondent who agreed to participate and indicated a lesbian, gay, or
bisexual identity, or who reported same-sex sexual activity in the year prior to
interview. A random sample of the remaining respondents 18-70 years was also
6 Some U.S. national studies, such as the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) and the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), include questions about dating or "going steady"
relationships, but these questions identify more casual relationships than the designation LAT implies. The
NSFG and Add Health also sample a narrower age range than does the GSS.
7 The overall CHIS response rate was 34%, calculated as the screener completion rate (56%) multiplied by the
completion rate (60%, California Health Interview Survey 2005). This response rate is comparable to the
California 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
2005) and only slightly lower than the 44% response rate in California for the National Survey of American
Families, which used monetary incentives (Westat Corporation 2003).
Strohm et al.: "Living Apart Together" relationships in the United States
186 http://www.demographic-research.org
interviewed as a heterosexual comparison group. Fifty-six percent of those selected for
the Cal-QOL were successfully re-interviewed 6 to 18 months after they agreed to be
re-contacted (Cochran and Mays 2007). Individuals who changed telephone numbers,
including those who moved, were not reachable due to the highly restricted identifying
information available on the original CHIS participants. We use weights to adjust for
household size and survey non-response in all analyses.8
The Cal-QOL analysis samples we use in this paper are defined by individuals'
reports of their sexual orientation identity and gender: 144 lesbians, 247 gay men, 752
heterosexual women, and 638 heterosexual men between the ages of 23-70.9 These
sample sizes exclude 74 individuals with missing data on socio-demographic variables
and 106 individuals with inconsistent information about sexual orientation in the CHIS
and the Cal-QOL surveys.10 In the analysis of perceived support, we exclude another 3
cases with missing data on the support variables, as well as 32 cases who were
administered a shorter instrument that excluded the support questions as part of a
refusal conversion experiment included in the Cal-QOL sampling methodology
(Narayanan et al. 2005).
The GSS and Cal-QOL have complementary strengths for studying LAT unions in
the United States. The GSS is a national sample and includes questions about
expectations of marriage and attitudes toward work, individualism, and gender roles
that are components of the shift in value orientation associated with the Second
Demographic Transition. The Cal-QOL contains relatively large numbers of lesbians
and gay men and also asks about perceived support from partners to provide insight on
potential benefits of non-residential partnerships. The two studies identify individuals in
LAT relationships using a similar approach. They differ, however, in the populations
from which the samples were drawn. The Cal-QOL data are more recent than are the
GSS data (2004-05 vs. 1996 and 1998, respectively). California is also more advanced
in many aspects of the Second Demographic Transition than other U.S. states
(Lesthaeghe and Neidert 2006). We consider these differences in interpreting our
8 The Cal-QOL weights are constructed using the following characteristics: age, sex, race-ethnicity,
geographic variables, presence of people under age 18 in the household, home ownership, and education. We
do not use the svy procedure in Stata with the Cal-QOL data because of the small samples of lesbians and gay
men.
9 We exclude bisexual women and men because of small sample sizes and because bisexuals may be
partnered with someone of the same or opposite sex.
10 A person's sexual orientation might be classified inconsistently in the CHIS and Cal-QOL for two
indistinguishable reasons: measurement errors in questions about sexual behavior and identity and true
changes in sexual orientation. Among the 106 individuals with inconsistent information on sexual orientation
across the two surveys, 102 were classified as having a minority sexual orientation in the CHIS but identified
themselves as heterosexual in the Cal-QOL. The remaining 4 cases were classified as heterosexual in the
CHIS but identified as gay or lesbian in the Cal-QOL. Measurement of sexual orientation and its stability is
an important topic, but it is beyond the scope of this paper.
Demographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7

findings. Together the datasets provide a more complete picture of LAT relationships
than either dataset provides separately.
3.2 Measures
Union status. The GSS used a standard question on current marital status. Those not
currently married were asked about heterosexual non-marital unions: "Do you have a
main romantic involvement ­ a (man/woman) you think of as a steady, a lover, a
partner, or whatever?" Respondents who answered affirmatively were then asked if they
lived with their partner. Using this information, we created five mutually exclusive
categories: married, cohabiting, LAT, previously-married single, never-married single.
The GSS did not ask about sexual orientation in these survey years so we restrict the
GSS analysis to heterosexual unions. We refer to women and men in the GSS as
"putatively heterosexual" to indicate our assumption about sexual orientation. This
assumption is reasonable given estimates that less than 3% of adults self-identify as
lesbian, gay, or bisexual (Black et al. 2000).
In the Cal-QOL, respondents were first asked, "Are you now married, living with a
partner in a marriage-like relationship, widowed, divorced, separated, or never
married?" Those neither married nor cohabiting were later asked, "When we began the
interview, you indicated that you were not married or currently living with a partner. Do
you have a relationship partner but maybe the two of you don't live together?" We
identify three relationship statuses in our analysis of lesbians and gay men: cohabiting,
LAT, and single. We limit the analysis to these statuses because same-sex marriage was
not legally recognized in California at the time of the survey, and because the small
sample sizes prevent us from distinguishing between single people who have never
been married and those who were previously married.11
Covariates. We consider several demographic characteristics of respondents in the
GSS and Cal-QOL. Age is measured in years. In the GSS, we distinguish three race-
ethnic groups: Whites, Blacks, and other races. A more fine-grained division of race-
ethnic groups is not possible because the GSS did not have a separate question to
identify Hispanic respondents in 1996 and 1998. In the Cal-QOL analyses, we treat

Hispanic. In the GSS and the Cal-QOL analyses, education is coded as a dichotomy
comparing individuals with a college degree to those who acquired less schooling. We
also distinguish individuals who report any children under 18 living in the household
from those without children in the household. Individuals who report working for pay
full-time or part-time are compared to those who are not working. We define GSS
respondents who live in areas with a population of 100,000 or more as living in an
urban area. Finally, the GSS asked respondents if they lived with both of their "own"
parents at age 16. We distinguish individuals who lived with their own mother and
father from those who had a different family structure (e.g., single parent, parent and
stepparent).
Attitudes. The 1996 and 1998 GSS asked several questions about work,
individualism, and gender roles. We examine union status differences in agreeing or
strongly agreeing with the statements: "Work is a person's most important activity"
(1998), and "Personal freedom is more important than the companionship of marriage"
(1996). The 1996 GSS also asked two questions about the division of labor and
emotional dependence in couple relationships, regardless of respondents' current
relationship status. We examine union status differences in whether individuals prefer a
gender-specialized division of labor or an arrangement in which men and women share
market and non-market work. We also examine the association between union status
and whether individuals prefer that members of a couple be emotionally independent or
dependent.12 Finally, using GSS data from both years, we examine whether respondents
think it is "very" or "somewhat" likely that they will marry their cohabiting or LAT
partner.
Perceived support from partner. The Cal-QOL assessed emotional and
instrumental support from romantic partners using three questions (Brim et al. 1995-
1996, Walen and Lachman 2000). Respondents were asked, "How much does your
spouse (partner) understand the way you feel about things?"; "How much can you rely
on your spouse (partner) for help if you have a serious problem?"; and "How much can
you open up to your spouse (partner) if you need to talk about your worries?" Response
options were: "Not at all," "A little," "Some," and "A lot." We examine respondents'
reports of "a lot" of support vs. less support by union status.
12 Question wording was: "Next, we have some questions about the kind of relationship you would like with a
spouse or partner. It doesn't matter whether you are now married or living with someone. For each pair of
items on the card, which type of relationship would you prefer?" The interviewer then handed the respondent
a card with paired options. The first pair we use is: "1. A relationship where the man has the main
responsibility for providing the household income and the woman has the main responsibility for taking care
of the home and family. 2. A relationship where the man and woman equally share responsibility for
providing the household income and taking care of the home and family?" The second pair we use is: "1. A
relationship where the man and woman are emotionally dependent on each other. 2. A relationship where the
man and woman are both emotionally independent?"

3.3 Analysis plan
The analysis has three parts. In the first, we describe the prevalence and demographic
correlates of different union statuses for putative heterosexuals using the pooled 1996
and 1998 GSS data, and for gay men, lesbians, and heterosexual men and women using
the Cal-QOL data. We begin with cross-tabulations for the men and women in the GSS
and for the four gender-sexual orientation groups in the Cal-QOL. We then estimate
four multinomial logistic regressions of union status on age, race-ethnicity, and
education, separately for putative heterosexual women and men in the GSS and for
lesbians and gay men in the Cal-QOL. For parsimony, we do not present the
multivariate results for the Cal-QOL heterosexual sample. Instead we comment briefly
on similarities and differences between the results for the GSS and Cal-QOL
heterosexual samples. Although the initial cross-tabulations include a wide range of
characteristics to provide a more complete description of individuals in LAT
relationships, we restrict the multivariate analysis to a limited number of characteristics
that are not, or are unlikely to be, influenced by union status. In both the GSS and Cal-
QOL models, we conduct tests for the joint significance of the covariates, where the
null hypothesis is that all the coefficients equal zero for the particular outcome
comparison (e.g., LAT vs. married).
In the second part of the analysis, we use information available in the GSS to
investigate differences by union status in individualistic attitudes, family ideals, and,
among heterosexuals in cohabiting and LAT unions, expectations of marriage, adjusting
for potentially confounding factors. We summarize these analyses by reporting
predicted probabilities from logistic regressions in which each attitude item is a
function of union status, gender, age, education, and race-ethnicity. We also explored
interactions between union status and gender. With one exception, the interactions were
not statistically significant. We describe the exception in the text.
In the third part, we use information from the Cal-QOL to describe variation in
individuals' perceptions of support from their partners among those in marital,
cohabiting, and LAT unions. We conduct the analyses separately by sexual orientation
and, as in the GSS analysis, we report predicted probabilities from logistic regressions
of each support item on union status, gender, age, race-ethnicity, and education.
4. Results
4.1 Differences in demographic characteristics by union status
In Table 1, we present the distribution of union status and the characteristics of
individuals in different types of unions for putatively heterosexual women and men

using weighted GSS data. Seven percent of U.S. women and 6% of U.S. men report that
they are in a LAT relationship, representing 35% of all individuals who are not married
or cohabiting. These individuals would be classified as "single" in conventional studies
that focus exclusively on co-residential unions.

People in LAT unions differ demographically from their peers who are in married
and cohabiting unions. For both women and men, individuals in LAT unions are
younger than those who are married. Those in LAT unions are almost twice as likely to
have a college degree as those in cohabiting unions (33% vs. 18% for women; 29% vs.
16% for men). As a group, women in LAT relationships are more ethnically diverse
than those who are married or cohabiting. For example, 58% of women in LAT unions
describe themselves as White compared to 85% of those who are married, and 80% of
those who are cohabiting. Among men, 75% of those in LAT unions identify
themselves as White, higher than the 58% of women in LAT unions. But without
information about partners' characteristics, we cannot determine whether LAT
relationships, like cohabiting unions, are more heterogamous on race-ethnicity than are
marriages (Blackwell and Lichter 2004).
Among women, there is little difference by union status in the percentage living
with children: 45% of those in LAT unions live with children, compared to 50% of
married women and 52% of cohabiting women. Among men, however, only 9% of
those in LAT unions live with children, compared to 49% of married men and 39% of
male cohabiters. There are few differences by union status in whether individuals are
employed, although married and previously married women are slightly less likely to be
employed than are other women and all men. Women and men in LAT unions are more
likely than are married people to live in an urban area. Like cohabiters, those in LAT
relationships are also less likely to have grown up living with both of their parents than
are their married counterparts. Those in LAT unions closely resemble single people
who have never been married: the two groups have similar mean ages, amounts of
schooling, and racial composition.
In the next table we present results for similar analyses of self-identified lesbians,
gay men, and heterosexual women and men using the weighted Cal-QOL data. Table 2
shows that 15% of lesbians and 17% of gay men are in LAT relationships.13 As is true
for putative heterosexuals in the GSS, lesbians and gay men who are in non-residential
partnerships are a substantial minority of lesbians and gay men who would be classified
as single by conventional indicators of relationship status, 37% and 27%, respectively.
Compared to lesbians and gay men, slightly lower percentages of heterosexual women
and men in the Cal-QOL sample report that they are in a LAT relationship, 12% of
13 The prevalence of LAT unions among lesbians and gay men in the Cal-QOL is slightly higher than reported
by Carpenter and Gates using data from the 2003 California LGBT Tobacco Survey (2008, Table 3). Our
studies differ in the age ranges in the analyses and the questions used to identify non-residential partnerships.
The Tobacco Survey asked a more restrictive question, and this might contribute to the slightly lower
percentages in non-residential unions reported by Carpenter and Gates. This survey asked respondents about a
primary partner, someone described as the person "you love more than anyone else and feel a unique
commitment to" (Carpenter and Gates 2008: 577).

significant among men (t = 1.68; p = .09) but not statistically significant among women
(t = 1.00; p = .32).

We also compared the prevalence of LAT relationships between heterosexuals in
the Cal-QOL and putative heterosexuals in the GSS. The percentages of heterosexual
women and men in non-residential unions in California are higher than in the United
States as a whole and the differences are statistically significant (12% vs. 7% for
women, t = 4.43, p < .01; 13% vs. 6% for men, t = 5.39, p < .01). This difference may
reflect both period increases in LAT relationships and California's more liberal
environment, as indicated by the state's greater prevalence of other non-traditional
family forms (Lesthaeghe and Neidert 2006).
Strohm et al.: "Living Apart Together" relationships in the United States
194 http://www.demographic-research.org
Lesbians in LAT unions are younger than those who are single, a finding
consistent with Carpenter and Gates (2008). This is in seeming contrast to the pattern
for heterosexual women for whom the ages of those in LAT relationships and the never
married single women are similar. Because of small sample sizes, however, the single
category in Table 2 combines never married and previously married women, who are
typically older.14 There is no statistically significant age difference between lesbians in
cohabiting and LAT relationships, although lesbians in cohabiting relationships are five
years older on average than lesbians in LAT relationships. Notably, there are no age
gradients by union status among gay men, also consistent with Carpenter and Gates
(2008). In contrast to the patterns for heterosexual women and men in the GSS, for
lesbians and gay men there are no statistically significant education or race-ethnic
differences between those in LAT unions and those in cohabiting unions. The data
suggest, however, that gay men in LAT relationships are somewhat more ethnically
diverse than are cohabiting gay men: 36% of gay men in LAT relationships are non-
White compared to 21% of cohabiting gay men.
The bottom two panels of Table 2 show the demographic characteristics of
heterosexuals in the Cal-QOL by union status. These results are generally consistent
with those in Table 1. For example, women and men in cohabiting and LAT
relationships are younger than those who are married. There are, however, two
exceptions to this similarity. In the Cal-QOL sample, heterosexual women in LAT
relationships are much less likely to live with a minor child compared to married or
cohabiting women, but in the GSS sample there are no differences among women in the
presence of children by union status. In addition, although the GSS data suggest an
association between education and union status, there are no significant education by
union status differences in the Cal-QOL samples of heterosexual women and men.
4.2 Multivariate analysis of demographic correlates
In Table 3 we present results of multinomial logistic regressions of union status on age,
education, and race-ethnicity, stratified by gender and sexual orientation. The results in
the two top panels of Table 3 are based on GSS data from putative heterosexuals. The
net associations are largely consistent with the gross associations in Table 1. Age
increases the log odds that a person will be married instead of in a LAT union. For
women, having a college education reduces the log odds of being married rather than
being in a LAT union. There is no statistically significant association between
education and being married vs. in a LAT relationship for men. Other associations are
14 Thirty-seven percent of single lesbians report being previously married.
Demographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 195
similar for women and men. Blacks are less likely than Whites to be married than in a
LAT relationship. Age is not associated with being in a cohabiting vs. a LAT union.
Having at least a college degree decreases the log odds of cohabiting vs. being in a LAT
union.

Quality of Life Survey, 2004-05, adults 23-70 years old who identify themselves as lesbian or gay.
Results are from four multinomial logistic regressions, one for each gender and sexual orientation. Reference group for each
covariate is in parentheses.
Tests of the joint significance of covariates suggest that women and men in LAT
unions do differ demographically from those in marital or cohabiting unions. But the
tests for the joint significance of covariates for the contrast between being single never-
married and being in a LAT relationship are not statistically significant. This is
consistent with the gross associations in Table 1 suggesting that those in LAT unions
and single never-married people are demographically similar.
We compared these results to results from the same model estimated for
heterosexual women and men in the Cal-QOL (not shown). In these models, we
combined previously married and never married single people. The associations
between age and union status were similar for the two samples. However, the Cal-QOL
and GSS results differ in the education-union status association. The GSS findings, as
shown in the top two panels of Table 3, indicate that having a college education reduces
the log odds of being in a cohabiting vs. LAT relationship for both women and men.
Being college educated also reduces women's log odds of being married vs. in a LAT
union. But in the Cal-QOL sample of heterosexuals, there is no statistically significant
association between education and union status. This is consistent with the absence of a
zero-order association in Table 2. We speculate about the difference between the GSS
and Cal-QOL results in the discussion section.
The last panel of Table 3 includes the results for lesbians and gay men from the
Cal-QOL survey. Among lesbians, age increases the log odds of being single vs. being
in a LAT union (p < .01) and also may increase the log odds of being in a cohabiting vs.
Demographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 197
LAT union (p = .11). There are no statistically significant associations between age and
union status among gay men, a pattern consistent with the results in Table 2 and with
those reported by Carpenter and Gates (2008). Among lesbians, the test of joint
significance of covariates is statistically significant for the single vs. LAT union
comparison, but not for the cohabiting vs. LAT union comparison. For gay men, neither
of the tests of joint significance is statistically significant.
4.3 Union status differences in attitudes and expectations about marriage among
heterosexuals
Using GSS data, we show in Table 4 the predicted probabilities of agreeing with four
attitudes about work, individualism, and gender roles by union status. For individuals in
LAT or cohabiting unions, we also show the predicted probability that individuals
expect to marry their current partner. Probabilities are arbitrarily evaluated for a 35
year-old White woman who did not complete college. The parameters from the models
generating these predicted probabilities are in Appendix Table A-1. As a group,
heterosexuals in LAT unions have more individualistic attitudes, are more work-
oriented, and are more likely to prefer that women and men share market and non-
market work than their married counterparts. The predicted probability of preferring
that men and women share responsibility for paid work and family care giving, for
example, is .78 for those in LAT unions but .67 for married people.
Heterosexual cohabiters and those in heterosexual LAT unions also hold different
attitudes about the division of family labor and emotional dependence between men and
women. Individuals in LAT unions are less likely than are cohabiters to prefer that men
and women share responsibility for paid work and family care giving. Those in LAT
relationships are more likely than are cohabiters, however, to prefer that men and
women be emotionally dependent. We anticipated that people in LAT unions would
hold more individualistic values than cohabiters. Although the predicted probability of
agreeing or strongly agreeing that "Personal freedom is more important than the
companionship of marriage" was higher for cohabiters than for those in LAT unions,
the difference is not statistically significant (p = .14).

These union status differences in attitudes are similar for women and men, with
one exception: Women in LAT unions are more likely than are their married
counterparts to agree that "Work is a person's most important activity." In contrast,
men in LAT unions and married men hold similar attitudes about the importance of
work (results not shown).
Individuals in LAT relationships are less likely than cohabiters to expect to marry
their current partner. The predicted probability of expecting marriage is .61 for those in
LAT relationships, compared to .76 for cohabiters. These predicted probabilities are
very close to the unadjusted weighted percentages, 60% vs. 75%, respectively.

4.4 Union type differences in perceptions of support from partners for
heterosexuals, gay men and lesbians
We used the Cal-QOL data to investigate how much support individuals in different
types of unions perceive from their partners. We conducted two separate analyses, one
for heterosexual women and men and one for lesbians and gay men. Table 5 includes
the predicted probabilities by union type that individuals report "a lot" of support from
their partner, adjusting for gender, age, education, and race-ethnicity. As in Table 4, we
report the predicted probabilities of each type of support for a 35 year-old White
woman who did not complete college. The full models are reported in Appendix Table
A-2.

Predicted probabilities are from logistic regressions of reporting "a lot" of support on union status, gender, age, education, and race-
ethnicity and evaluated for a 35 year-old White woman who did not complete college. See Appendix Table A-2 for model
parameters.
Individuals in LAT unions perceive moderate to high levels of support from their
partners, but they report less instrumental support than do those who are married or
cohabiting. Among heterosexuals, for example, the predicted probability of being able
to rely on a partner "a lot" for help with a serious problem is .87 for a married person,
.82 for a cohabiter, and .59 for someone in a LAT union. The differences between
individuals in marital and LAT unions and between those in cohabiting and LAT unions
are statistically significant at p  .05.
Like heterosexuals in LAT unions, lesbians and gay men in LAT unions are less
likely than are cohabiters to say that they can rely on their partners "a lot" for help with
a serious problem. Notably, for heterosexuals and for lesbians and gay men, there is no

200 http://www.demographic-research.org
statistically significant difference between those in LAT relationships and cohabiters in
how much individuals say their partners understand their feelings or that they can open
up to their partners.
In a separate analysis (not shown), we investigated interactions between gender
and union status. Although heterosexual men reported higher levels of support from
their partners than did heterosexual women, we found no evidence that the association
between union status and perceived support is different for women and men within each
sexual orientation group.
5. Discussion
Demographic data that focus only on household-based relationships ignore the fact that
some couples live apart but maintain significant ties to each other. By expanding
conventional union categories to include "Living Apart Together" (LAT) unions for
both heterosexual and same-sex couples, our study illustrates the diversity of couple
relationships in the United States. These non-residential unions are part of a broad shift
in how individuals organize their family relationships. By ignoring non-residential
partnerships, researchers miss sources of support that may enhance individuals' well-
being. How serious an omission this is depends on how common LAT relationships are:
Our finding that one third of individuals who would be classified as "single" by
conventional measures of union status are actually in LAT relationships suggests that
ignoring these relationships is a serious problem.
Estimates of the prevalence of LAT relationships in the heterosexual population
vary for the two data sources we use. With national data from the late 1990s, we
estimate that 6% of men and 7% of women were in non-residential relationships
compared to 13% and 12% of heterosexual men and women, respectively, for
California in the mid 2000s. The higher prevalence estimates for the more recent data
from California can be interpreted as either an increase in non-residential unions over
time or as attributable to California's more advanced stage in the Second Demographic
Transition (Lesthaeghe and Neidert 2006). Without more recent national data on LAT
unions, we cannot distinguish between these two interpretations.
Our data from California provide mixed support for our speculation that LAT
relationships are more common among gay men and lesbians than among heterosexual
men and women. We find that LAT relationships are somewhat more common among
gay men than among heterosexual men. Lesbians and heterosexual women do not differ
significantly in the prevalence of LAT relationships, although the marginally higher
percentage of lesbians in LAT relationships is consistent with our suggestion that LAT
relationships are a way for lesbians and gay men to keep their sexual identities private.
Demographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 201
Prevalence estimates from both of our cross-sectional data sources may understate
the importance of LAT relationships in individuals' lives if there are high rates of
transition between LAT and other union statuses (Binstock and Thornton 2003).
Longitudinal data are needed to estimate the incidence of LAT unions and to determine
for whom LAT is a transitional arrangement and for whom it is a long-term way of life.
Taking account of movements in and out of relationships might be especially important
for comparisons among lesbians, gay men, and heterosexuals in light of the higher rates
of disruption that characterize same-sex co-residential unions (Andersson et al. 2006,
Kalmijn, Loeve, and Manting 2007). If lesbians and gay men experience more rapid
transitions out of co-residential unions, they are likely to spend relatively more time
single or in relationships that are sometimes, but not always, less committed, such as
LAT unions. This may account for our finding that LAT relationships are more
common among gay men than among heterosexual men in cross-sectional data.
Our findings also shed light on the significance of LAT relationships throughout
the life course. Among heterosexual women and men and among lesbians, age
decreases the chance of being in a LAT union compared to a co-residential union
(marriage for heterosexual women and men, cohabitation for lesbians). This pattern in
both the national and California samples is consistent with qualitative evidence that
LAT relationships are a way for young people to balance a desire for intimacy with the
pursuit of education, work, or financial goals (Levin 2004).
The absence of association between age and LAT union status for gay men is
consistent with Carpenter and Gates' (2008) finding using another sample from
California. Our combined findings suggest that non-residential partnerships are a
significant union type throughout the lives of gay men. Gay men may be better able
than lesbians or heterosexual women and men to afford the financial costs of
maintaining two separate households. Determining why LAT relationships do not
appear to be a life course phenomenon for gay men is an important question for future
research.
Research on life course variation in LAT unions also could fruitfully examine the
role of economic constraints at different life stages. That young people are more likely
than older people to say they live apart due to economic constraints (Beaujouan,
Regnier-Loilier, and Villeneuve-Gokalp 2008) probably reflects the lower incomes of
young adults. In addition, economic constraints may have different effects on whether a
person is in a LAT union at different ages. When housing costs are high, for example,
younger persons still living with their parents may delay moving in with their LAT
partner. For older persons already living on their own, high housing costs may have the
opposite effect, all else being equal, motivating persons in LAT relationships to live
together to save money. Future studies on non-residential unions should take account of
Strohm et al.: "Living Apart Together" relationships in the United States
202 http://www.demographic-research.org
individuals' economic resources throughout life as well as contextual factors such as
employment opportunities and housing markets.
We find that for the United States as a whole, as in Europe, education is positively
associated with being in a non-residential partnership compared to cohabitation (for
women and men) and compared to marriage (for women) (Haskey and Lewis 2006,
Castro-Martín, Domínquez-Folgueras, and Martín-García 2008). For California,
however, there is no statistically significant association between education and LAT
union status once age and race-ethnicity are taken into account. The absence of an
education-union status association holds for heterosexual men and women as well as for
gay men and lesbians in California. The different results for the United States as a
whole and California suggest the intriguing possibility that educational gradients in the
prevalence of non-residential relationships erode with more widespread acceptance of
the diverse ways that members of couples can share their lives beyond the context of
traditional marriage.
Consistent with findings from in-depth interview studies in other countries
(Haskey and Lewis 2006, Levin 2004), we found that in the United States heterosexuals
in LAT unions place a higher value on independence and are more likely to expect both
partners to contribute to paid work and family care giving, compared to married people.
This finding is compatible with the portrait of LAT heterosexual couples as being more
work-oriented, individualistic, and egalitarian than married people. The lack of parallel
data for lesbians and gay men on attitudes toward work, individualism, and gender roles
poses a problem for research on same-sex relationships. A question about sexual
orientation on future versions of the General Social Survey core questionnaire will
provide much needed information about the attitudes of lesbians and gay men.
Regardless of union type or sexual orientation, high percentages of individuals in a
relationship said that they can count on their partners for support. Nevertheless, married
persons reported more support than did those in LAT unions. There was little difference
between individuals in LAT and cohabiting relationships in perceptions of emotional
support from partners, but individuals in LAT unions perceived less instrumental
support from their partners than did cohabiters. We observed this pattern for
heterosexuals, lesbians, and gay men. This finding might reflect the relative ease of
fostering emotional bonds without living together, compared to the difficulty of
obtaining instrumental support from a partner who lives in a different household. If
LAT relationships are more transitory than cohabiting relationships, the short-term
nature of the union also might contribute to the lower levels of expected help with
serious problems reported by those in LAT unions. Longitudinal data are necessary to
determine whether living together has a causal effect on perceptions of support, or
whether a couple chooses to live together because the partners want to provide more
support and think they can count on each other for support.
Demographic Research: Volume 21, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 203
Overall, our findings reinforce the view of LAT relationships as heterogeneous.
That less than two thirds of heterosexuals in LAT unions expect to marry their current
partner is only one illustration that LAT relationships, like cohabitating unions, are not
always a stepping stone to marriage. The diversity of couple types is part of the long-
term movement away from lifelong marriage and the growing number of choices
individuals are able to make about their personal lives (Bumpass 1990, Surkyn and
Lesthaeghe 2002). It is tempting to treat these emerging couple types, such as LAT
unions, as less consequential than more established union types such as marriage or
cohabitation. To be sure, living together almost always entails some degree of economic
and social interdependence. But couples may maintain significant ties even if they do
not live together (Haskey and Lewis 2006); in our study, for example, individuals in
LAT and cohabiting unions reported similar levels of emotional support. And even
when a couple lives in the same household, the individuals may have only marginal
connections to each other's lives (Cross-Barnet, Cherlin, and Burton 2008).
Appreciating the role of LAT relationships throughout the life course ­ particularly
as an arrangement that enables individuals to balance autonomy with the obligations of
intimate relationships ­ is critical for understanding family ties in the 21st century.
Integration of LAT relationships into theories of family change, however, is hampered
by the lack of data on non-residential unions. One reason for the lack of data is the
inherent ambiguity about whether a couple is "Living Apart Together" or in a less
committed dating relationship (Levin and Trost 1999, Sobotka and Toulemon 2008). To
address this problem, the wording of questions about relationship status should
distinguish LAT unions from less committed relationships in a way that is meaningful
to respondents (Kiernan 2002). Survey questions about LAT status use the following
terms: "main romantic involvement" (GSS), a "relationship partner" (Cal-QOL), an
"intimate relationship" (the 2001 Canadian Social Survey), or a "regular partner" (the
Omnibus Survey in Great Britain). It is unknown, however, whether individuals in LAT
unions would describe their unions using these terms and whether these terms elicit
responses that distinguish serious unions from more casual dating unions. The difficulty
of determining the most appropriate phrase is similar to the problem of describing
cohabiting "partners" (Manning and Smock 2005).
There also may be differences in the interpretation of these terms by sexual
orientation, gender, and age. Questions that ask about LAT or cohabiting relationships
as "marriage-like" may misclassify important subgroups, for example, members of
same-sex couples who might not view their relationship as similar to marriage (Stiers
1999). Men and women may differ in how they distinguish casual from serious
relationships. Further, the term "intimate relationship" suggests a sexual relationship,
which older individuals may not be as comfortable addressing in a survey. In-depth
Strohm et al.: "Living Apart Together" relationships in the United States
204 http://www.demographic-research.org
interviewing and cognitive interviewing should inform new data collection on LAT
relationships.
A second reason for the lack of data on LAT relationships is the household-based
orientation of most demographic surveys that neglect couple relationships when both
partners are not in the sampled household. Identifying LAT unions in survey data
requires information about union status that is not conditional on whether an individual
lives with a partner. The question sequence in the 1996 and 1998 General Social
Surveys is a good example of how to do this. In these years, the survey asked unmarried
respondents if they have a "main romantic involvement;" if the respondent answered
affirmatively, the survey then asked if the respondent was living with the partner. This
question ordering means that all individuals who are part of a couple are identified in
the same way. Questions about a couple's relationship, such as the amount of shared
leisure time or frequency of disagreements, should be asked in the same way regardless
of whether the partners live together. Adopting this strategy is more difficult for some
aspects of the relationship than for others, as is evident in studies of parent-adult child
relationships (Bianchi et al. 2008).
Researchers should also develop better ways to identify who lives together. Most
research treats co-residence as a dichotomy: people either live with their partner or they
do not. For a significant minority of the population, however, residence is not a
dichotomy and may be better conceptualized as a continuum (Martin 2007).
Determining where and with whom a person lives is especially challenging for
researchers studying both LAT and cohabiting unions because these unions are often
transitory states (Binstock and Thornton 2003, Bumpass and Lu 2000, Carlson,
McLanahan, and England 2004).
Family demographers have long recognized that parents and children do not
always live in the same household, and that people who are not kin may live together
(Seltzer et al. 2005). Extending this observation to recognize that couples do not always
live together will enhance understanding of families in the 21st century.
