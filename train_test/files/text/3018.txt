Identifying Patients for Weight-Loss Treatment
An Empirical Evaluation of the NHLBI Obesity Education Initiative
Expert Panel Treatment Recommendations
Michaela Kiernan, PhD; Marilyn A. Winkleby, PhD
Background: The NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute) Obesity Education Initiative Expert
Panel recently proposed that clinicians and other health
care professionals use a new treatment algorithm to
identify patients for weight-loss treatment. In addition
to the usual assessment of body mass index (BMI, cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of
height in meters), the new algorithm includes the
assessment of abdominal obesity (as measured by waist
circumference) and other cardiovascular disease (CVD)
risk factors.
Methods: We examined the percentage of adults meet-
ing the criteria of the panel's treatment algorithm: BMI
30 or {[BMI, 25.0-29.9 or waist circumference 88 cm
(women) 102 cm (men)] and 2 CVD risk factors} in
a sample of 2844 black, 2754 Mexican American, and 3504
white adults, aged 25 to 64 years, from the Third Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-
1994.
Results: Across ethnic groups, more than 98% of
adults (normal weight, overweight, and obese) received
the same treatment recommendations using the panel's
algorithm and an algorithm based only on BMI and
CVD risk factors, without waist circumference. For
normal-weight adults, almost none (0.0%-1.8%) had a
large waist circumference as defined above and 2 or
more CVD risk factors. Using the usual criterion of a
BMI of 30 or higher, a substantial percentage of at-risk
overweight women and men (BMI, 25.0-29.9) with 2 or
more CVD risk factors were missed (8.4% and 19.3%,
respectively).
Conclusions: Despite the potential importance of ab-
dominal obesity as a CVD risk factor, these results chal-
lenge the clinical utility of including waist circumfer-
ence in this new algorithm and suggest that using BMI
and CVD risk factors may be sufficient.

OVERWEIGHT and obe-
sity--degrees of excess
weight--are associated
with cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD) mortality
and risk factors, increasing economic costs,
and negative social consequences.1 More
than 54% of Americans are overweight, an
8% increase in less than 15 years.2 This
sharp increase has underscored the im-
portance of timely and effective preven-
tion and treatment efforts for subgroups
at risk. Much of the increase is due to an
increase in the percentage of the heaviest
Americans, those who are obese rather
than merely overweight.2 Of particular
concern is the high prevalence of obesity
in women, especially black and Mexican
American women. More than 37% of black
women and 34% of Mexican American
women are obese compared with 22% of
white women.2
The NHLBI (National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute) Obesity Education Ini-
tiative Expert Panel recently released a
report1,3 intended for physicians and as-
sociated health care professionals, re-
search investigators, and policymakers that
presented a series of evidence-based clini-
cal guidelines on the assessment and treat-
ment of obesity. Based on these guide-
lines, clinicians can classify those patients
at risk for increased morbidity and mor-
tality and rely on an algorithm to identify
an appropriate treatment recommenda-
tion--either advice regarding the impor-
tance of maintaining current weight and
addressing other risk factors or specific
goals for weight-loss treatment and risk
factor modification.1
Specifically, the panel recom-
mended that "risk status should be as-
sessed by determining the degree of over-
weight or obesity based on body mass
index (BMI), the presence of abdominal
obesity based on weight circumference,
and the presence of concomitant CVD risk
factors or comorbidities."1(p62) The recom-

mendation to assess abdominal obesity in addition to BMI
was based on accruing evidence of the relationship
between abdominal obesity and coronary heart disease
(CHD),4,5 as well as CVD risk factors.6,7 For practical
purposes in epidemiological and clinical settings, the
panel recommended using waist circumference to assess
abdominal fat and proposed sex-specific cutoff points
that can be used to identify those at increased risk. For a
given BMI, individuals with larger waist circumferences
(ie, exceeding the cutoff points) are thought to be at
higher relative risk for disease than individuals of similar
weight with smaller waist circumferences. This hypoth-
esis includes patients of normal weight with large waist
circumferences. The recommendation to assess obesity-
associated risk factors, especially those related to CVD,
recognized that such concomitant risk factors are often
associated with excess weight8 and that the treatment of
such risk factors can be as important as the treatment for
excess weight.1
To date, no study has identified the percentage of
Americans needing weight-loss treatment using the
panel's treatment algorithm. Such data are critical for
physicians and other health care professionals to deter-
mine how the algorithm will affect the demand for
treatment services. In addition, given the constraints of
time and cost in the present health care system, it is
important to evaluate the clinical utility of assessing 3
different measurements (BMI, waist circumference, and
CVD risk factors) to identify patients in need of weight-
loss treatment.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to esti-
mate the percentage of Americans needing weight-loss
treatment using the panel's treatment algorithm. We com-
pared this algorithm with less complex algorithms, in-
METHODS
Conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics,
Hyattsville, Md, NHANES III assessed the health and
nutrition of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population
of the United States using the same stratified, multistage
probability design used in previous NHANESs. It was
conducted in two 3-year phases. Phase I was conducted
from 1988 to 1991 and phase II from 1991 to 1994. It
included a total sample of 33 994 persons aged 2 months
or older.
The staff conducted NHANES III in households, ad-
ministering questionnaires to families, adults, and chil-
dren. Standardized medical examinations followed, con-
ducted in NHANES III mobile examination centers. The
household surveys included demographic, socioeco-
nomic, dietary, and health history questions; the medical
examinations included measurements of blood pressure and
lipid and glucose levels.
The sample for our analysis included black, Mexican
American, and white women and men aged 25 to 64 years
who completed both the home questionnaire and medical
examination. We used the lower age cutoff point of 25 years
to ensure that most individuals had completed their high-
est level of education (a covariate included in our analy-
sis) and the upper age cutoff point of 64 years to avoid prob-
lems of selection effects due to morbidity and mortality
unrelated to CVD.10 We excluded data for adults in the fol-
lowing order: adults whose surveys were coded by NHANES
III as unreliable (n=16), women who were pregnant
(n=162), adults who did not complete both the home ques-
tionnaire and the medical examination (n=890), adults from
other ethnic groups (n=488), and adults missing values for
education level (n=107). The protocol for this analysis
was approved by the Stanford University Administrative
Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research, Palo Alto,
Calif.
DEFINITION OF VARIABLES
Participants who classified their race or ethnicity as black,
Mexican or Mexican American, or white were included in
our analysis. Participants reported the highest grade or year
of school that they had completed. We selected years of edu-
cation as a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) be-
cause of its strong association with indicators of over-
weight11 and its role as a possible confounder of ethnic
differences in obesity.12 In addition, unlike income or oc-
cupation level, the measure of years of education is avail-
able regardless of employment status, is a more constant
measure of lifelong SES, and is not affected by the risk fac-
tors we examined.13,14
The NHLBI Obesity Education Initiative Expert Panel
treatment algorithm proposed that health care profession-
als assess patients' BMI, waist circumference, and obesity-
associated diseases and risk factors (eg, CVD risk factors,
sleep apnea, gallstones, and stress incontinence) when iden-
tifying patients in need of weight-loss treatment.1 The pri-
mary outcome variable for the present study was the per-
centage of adults meeting the criteria of the panel's treatment
algorithm: BMI 30 or {[BMI, 25.0-29.9 or waist circum-
ference 88 cm (women) 102 cm (men)] and 2 risk
factors}.
Anthropometric measures (height, weight, and waist
circumference) were obtained according to standard pro-
tocols.15 The waist was measured at the iliac crest.9 Body
mass index, a measure of relative weight, was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in
meters.
For this analysis, we focused on the 7 CVD risk fac-
tors recommended by the panel for assessment because of
the strong associations of abdominal obesity with CVD risk
factors.6 Physical inactivity was not included in the 7 pri-
mary CVD risk factors by the panel because of the lack of
existing quantitative risk cutoff points.1 The 7 CVD risk
factors are listed below.
1. Cigarette smoking. Participants were classified as
current smokers if they reported that they had smoked at
least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and were cur-
rently smoking cigarettes.
2. Hypertension. Health examiners measured systolic
and diastolic blood pressure from the right arm of partici-
pants while they were seated. Based on the mean of the sec-
ond and third of 3 readings, participants were classified
as having hypertension if their systolic blood pressure was

cluding one based on BMI and CVD risk factors only, with-
out waist circumference. We examined data for 9102
black, Mexican American, and white adults from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III).9
RESULTS
Of the 9969 women and men in the sample, 867 (8.7%)
could not be classified using the panel's treatment algo-
rithm because they had incomplete data for BMI (n=4),
waist circumference (n=307), the presence of 2 or more
CVD risk factors (n=462), or some combination of these
assessments (n=94). Black participants were more likely
to have incomplete data (12.0%) than Mexican Ameri-
can (8.3%) or white (7.3%) participants (2=22.7; P
.01). However, there were no significant differences be-
tween those with complete and incomplete data for the
3 algorithm assessments by sex, age, years of education,
or BMI.
DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS
The selected NHANES III sample included 2844 black,
2754 Mexican American, and 3504 white men and
women, aged 25 to 64 years, who completed both the
home questionnaire and the medical examination and had
complete data for the 3 algorithm assessments. There were
large numbers of women and men in 2 subgroups that
are typically underrepresented in studies of ethnic dif-
ferences in obesity: Mexican American adults with more
than 12 years of education (209 women and 261 men)
and white adults with less than 12 years of education (329
women and 318 men). Descriptive results for sociode-
140 mm Hg or higher and/or their diastolic blood pres-
sure was 90 mm Hg or higher and/or they reported cur-
rently taking prescribed medicine for hypertension.
3. High level of non­high-density lipoprotein (non-
HDL) cholesterol. The panel's treatment algorithm recom-
mended identifying patients with a high level of low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (ie, LDL cholesterol
level  4.1 mmol/L [160.0 mg/dL]). For this analysis, we
identified participants with a high level of non-HDL cho-
lesterol rather than a high level of LDL cholesterol for 2
reasons. First, non-HDL cholesterol levels may be a better
indicator of atherogenic lipoprotein particles than indi-
rectly estimated LDL cholesterol levels.16 Second, the mea-
surement of non-HDL cholesterol does not require fasting
blood samples and, thus, allowed the use of the entire
NHANES III sample (only half of the sample fasted
overnight). Measurements were taken from serum speci-
mens and analyzed by standard protocols.9 The non-HDL
value was calculated as the difference between total cho-
lesterol and HDL cholesterol levels. Participants were clas-
sified as having a high level of non-HDL cholesterol if the
serum concentration was 4.9 mmol/L (187.6 mg/dL for men
and 187.8 mg/dL for women) or higher, a research-
derived cutoff point corresponding to the LDL cutoff point
of 4.1 mmol/L (160.0 mg/dL) or higher.16
4. Low level of HDL cholesterol. Participants were
classified as having a low level of HDL cholesterol if
their HDL cholesterol level was less than 0.9 mmol/L
(35.0 mg/dL).
5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The treatment algo-
rithm recommended identifying patients with clinical type
2 diabetes (ie, fasting plasma glucose level  7.0 mmol/L
[126.0 mg/dL]). Fasting plasma glucose levels were deter-
mined using a microadaptation of the national glucose oxi-
dase reference method9 and were available for the half of
the sample that fasted. Therefore, participants were clas-
sified as having type 2 diabetes mellitus if they fasted for 8
hours or longer and had plasma glucose levels of 7.0 mmol/L
(126 mg/dL) or higher and/or if they reported a medical
history of diabetes mellitus (other than during preg-
nancy) with an age at onset older than 25 years.
6. Family history of premature CHD. The treatment
algorithm recommended identifying patients with a family
history of premature CHD if their father or other first-
degree male relative (eg, brother) experienced a definite
myocardial infarction or sudden death at or before 55 years
of age or at or before 65 years of age for their mother or
other first-degree female relative (eg, sister). Because a pre-
cise measure of family history of premature CHD was not
available, we used a combination of the only 2 existing
NHANES questions on family history of CHD. We identi-
fied participants with a family history of premature CHD
if they reported that any of their blood relatives (includ-
ing grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles,
and cousins, living or deceased) had ever been told by a
doctor that they had a heart attack before the age of 50
years and if the participants reported that at least one par-
ent or sibling (first-degree relative) had experienced a heart
attack.
7. Age. Age was classified as a CVD risk factor for men
if they were 45 years or older and for women if they were
55 years or older.
DATA ANALYSIS
We conducted our primary statistical analysis using
SUDAAN, version 7.11 (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC), a software program that
adjusts for the complex NHANES III sample design for
calculating variance estimates. All analyses incorporated
sampling weights that adjusted for unequal probabilities
of selection. We used SUDAAN to calculate weighted
means and percentages. We conducted logistic regression
models separately by sex for the main binary outcome
measure, percentage of adults identified as needing
weight-loss treatment. The predictor variables were eth-
nicity (black and Mexican American adults were com-
pared separately with white adults; each comparison used
whites as the reference group), years of education (con-
tinuous and centered at 12 years); and the first-order
interaction term (ethnicityeducation). Age was not
used as a predictor variable because it was a CVD risk fac-
tor used in the panel's treatment algorithm to construct
the outcome variable. Because of the large sample size,
we selected a conservative level of statistical significance
(P.01; 2-tailed).

mographic characteristics and CVD risk factors are pre-
sented by sex for the 3 ethnic groups in Table 1. Mexi-
can American adults were younger, had fewer years of
education, and were less likely to be born in the United
States than black or white adults.
ADULTS NEEDING WEIGHT-LOSS TREATMENT
As previously mentioned, the panel recommended assess-
ing 3 measures: BMI, waist circumference, and CVD risk
factors.1 The treatment algorithm was constructed to rely
on either 1 (eg, BMI 30) or a combination of 2 of the 3
measures at a time (eg, BMI, 25.0-29.0 and 2 CVD risk
factors) to identify patients needing weight-loss treat-
ment. Table 2 displays the percentage of black, Mexican
American, and white women and men by all possible com-
binationsofthe3assessmentmeasuresforcomparison.The
treatment recommendations--either "advise to maintain
weight/address other risk factors" (M) or "clinician and pa-
tientdevisegoalsandtreatmentstrategyforweightlossand
risk factor control" (T)--are listed at the bottom of the col-
umn of each assessment combination.
Normal-Weight Adults
For brevity, the term normal-weight adults in the present
study describes all adults with a BMI less than 25, includ-
ing underweight adults. As shown in Table 2, when using
the panel's treatment algorithm to determine the appro-
priate treatment recommendation (M or T), it is only nec-
essary to measure waist circumference for adults of nor-
mal weight with 2 or more CVD risk factors (columns C
and D). However, almost no women (1.0%-1.8%) or men
(0.0%-0.2%) were of normal weight, had a large waist cir-
cumferenceasdefinedbythepanel,andhad2ormoreCVD
risk factors (column D). That is, almost no normal-
weight adults were identified as needing weight-loss treat-
ment perhaps in part because the correlation between BMI
and waist circumference was high for all ethnic groups for
both women (0.90-0.91) and men (0.92-0.93).
If the waist circumference cutoff point was low-
ered to 76.2 cm (30 in) for women, a value associated
with a 2-fold higher risk of CHD in women,4 4.0% of black
women, 3.0% of Mexican-American women, and 6.9%
of white women would be identified as needing weight-
loss treatment (ie, normal-weight participants who met
or exceeded the 76.2-cm waist circumference cutoff point
and had 2 CVD risk factors).
Overweight Adults
For overweight adults (BMI, 25.0-29.9), the panel's treat-
ment algorithm relies only on the assessment of BMI and
the presence of 2 or more CVD risk factors to identify
adults needing weight-loss treatment (columns G and H).
In fact, the panel's recommended waist circumference cut-
off points (ie, 88 cm for women or 102 cm for men)
could be increased or decreased without affecting the over-
all percentage of overweight adults identified as need-
ing weight-loss treatment. For instance, for overweight
white women with 2 or more CVD risk factors, lower-
ing the waist circumference cutoff point to 76.2 cm would
change the relative percentages in columns G and H from
1.6% and 6.7% to 0.0% and 8.3%, respectively. How-
ever, the overall percentage of overweight white women
identified as in need of treatment would remain the same,
8.3% (add columns G and H). Thus, for overweight adults,
the assessment of waist circumference does not provide
independent information for determining the appropri-
ate treatment recommendation.

Obese Adults
For obese adults (BMI  30), the panel's treatment al-
gorithm relies only on the assessment of BMI to identify
adults needing weight-loss treatment (columns I, J, K,
and L). The panel stated that "it is not necessary to mea-
sure waist circumference in patients with a BMI  35 kg/
m2; the measurement usually will be greater than the cut-
points."1(p61)
In summary, despite the panel's recommendation to
assess BMI, waist circumference, and CVD risk factors
to identify adults in need of weight-loss treatment, it may
be unnecessary to assess waist circumference in (1) nor-
mal-weight adults because so few individuals exist with
a large waist circumference, (2) overweight adults be-
cause waist circumference does not add information that
changes the treatment recommendation, and (3) obese
adults because the majority have a waist circumference
that exceeds the waist circumference cutoff point.
COMPARISON OF THE PANEL'S ALGORITHM
WITH 3 LESS COMPLEX ALGORITHMS
A comparison of 4 treatment algorithms is shown at the
bottom of Table 2. Across all ethnic groups, almost all
women (98.4%) and men (99.9%) received same treat-
ment recommendations using the panel's algorithm and
a less complex algorithm based only on BMI and CVD
risk factors (ie, BMI  30 or BMI, 25.0-29.9 and  2 CVD
risk factors). Comparing the pattern of treatment rec-
ommendations (M and T) for these 2 algorithms, there
is no assessment combination for which the treatment
recommendation for the panel's treatment algorithm is
to maintain and the recommendation for the algorithm
based only on BMI and CVD risk factors is to treat. Thus,
the false-positive rate is 0% for both women and men
across all 3 ethnic groups. In addition, there is only one
assessment combination (column D) for which the treat-
ment recommendation for the panel's treatment algo-
rithm is to treat and the recommendation for the algo-
rithm based only on BMI and CVD risk factors is to
maintain. Thus, the false-negative rate is equivalent to
the percentages listed for normal-weight adults with 2
or more CVD risk factors and a waist circumference that
exceeds the cutoff point (column D; 1.0%-1.8% of women
and 0.0%-0.2% of men).
Fewer women (83.3%) and men (77.5%) received the
same treatment recommendations using the panel's algo-
rithm and an algorithm based only on waist circumfer-
ence and CVD risk factors (ie, waist circumference 88/
102 cm and  2 CVD risk factors). The disadvantage of
only using waist circumference and CVD risk factors is that
asubstantialpercentageofadultswouldbeadvisedtomain-
tain rather than lose weight. This group includes, but is not
limited to, overweight men with 2 or more CVD risk fac-
torswithoutalargewaistcircumference(columnG;13.2%-
14.1% of men) as well as some obese women (add col-
umns I, J, and K, resulting in 13.0%-26.3% of women).
The disadvantage of an algorithm based only on the
usual assessment of a BMI of 30 or higher is that a sub-

stantial percentage of overweight adults with 2 or more
CVD risk factors would be advised to maintain rather than
lose weight (add columns G and H, resulting in 6.9%-
9.4% of women and 16.1%-19.8% of men). Summariz-
ing across the 4 algorithms, the algorithm based only on
BMI and CVD risk factors identifies almost the same
percentage of adults needing treatment as the panel's
more complex algorithm that incorporates waist cir-
cumference.
DIFFERENCES IN WEIGHT-LOSS TREATMENT
BY ETHNICITY AND SES
We examined whether the percentage of women and men
identified as needing weight-loss treatment differed by
ethnicity and SES (as measured by years of education)
using the less complex algorithm based only on BMI and
CVD risk factors. Table 3 and the Figure present the
main effects and interaction effects for logistic regres-
sion models by sex. Although less education was asso-
ciated with a higher percentage of both black and white
women needing weight-loss treatment (main effect of edu-
cation), a higher percentage of black women were iden-
tified for weight-loss treatment than white women across
all levels of education (main effect of ethnicity, black).
Although less education was associated with a higher per-
centage of both Mexican American and white women
needing weight-loss treatment, having more than a high
school education was associated with a lower percent-
age identified for treatment for white women only (in-
teraction effect of ethnicity education, Mexican

Less education was associated with a higher per-
centage of both black and white men identified for weight-
loss treatment (main effect of education). Having a high
school education or less was associated with a higher per-
centage of white men needing weight-loss treatment than
Mexican American men; however, having more than a
high school education was associated with a lower per-
centage identified for treatment for white men only (in-
teraction effect of ethnicity education, Mexican
American).
COMMENT
Despite the potential importance of abdominal obesity
as a predictor for CHD,4,5 the results of the present study
call into question the clinical utility of measuring waist
circumference to identify patients in need of weight-
loss treatment. More than 98% of women and 99% of men

received the same treatment recommendations using the
panel's algorithm (based on BMI, waist circumference,
and CVD risk factors) and a less complex algorithm (based
on BMI and CVD risk factors only). In addition, the less
complex algorithm based only on BMI and CVD risk fac-
tors identified a substantial percentage of at-risk over-
weight women (8.4%) and men (19.3%) with 2 or more
CVD risk factors in need of treatment. These at-risk over-
weight adults, for whom treatment could prevent sub-
sequent obesity, would be missed using only the usual
criterion of a BMI of 30 or higher. Given increasing time
demands on clinicians and other health care profession-
als, using the less complex algorithm based only on BMI
and CVD risk factors appears to be sufficient for identi-
fying patients in need of weight-loss treatment.
IS WAIST A WASTE?
In this study, almost no women (1.0%-1.8%) and men
(0.0%-0.2%) were of normal weight, had a large waist cir-
cumference as defined by the panel, and had 2 or more
CVD risk factors. Thus, it is tempting to conclude that
waist circumference may not be useful for identifying nor-
mal-weight patients who need weight-loss treatment.
However, in a recent epidemiological study4 examining
the relationship between self-reported waist circumfer-
ence and incidence of CHD in women, a smaller waist
circumference cutoff point of 76.2 cm was associated with
a 2-fold higher risk of CHD. Thus, a lower cutoff point
may be more appropriate for normal-weight women.
Clearly, further research is needed to determine whether
cutoff points for waist circumference exist that are in-
dicative of disease in normal-weight men, too.
In the panel's algorithm, measuring waist circum-
ference does not add independent information for iden-
tifying which overweight patients (BMI, 25.0-29.9) need
weight-loss treatment nor does it make recommenda-
tions for different types of treatments for overweight pa-
tients with and without a large waist circumference. In
fact, the waist circumference cutoff points can be raised
or lowered without affecting the overall percentage of
overweight adults identified for weight-loss treatment.
Thus, the recommendation to assess waist circumfer-
ence in addition to BMI and CVD risk factors to screen
all overweight patients may be undermined because of
the added time and cost involved for clinicians. How-
ever, assessing waist circumference may be helpful when
tracking and motivating subgroups of patients for whom
it is important to measure treatment efficacy using mul-
tiple outcomes over time. Such patients include those with
metabolic complications due to CVD1 and those who are
unaccustomed to thinking that they are at risk and need
to lose weight.
The high correlation between BMI and waist cir-
cumference found in the present study for women and
men across different ethnic groups suggests that it may
be difficult to discern the independent contribution of
waist circumference to either total or abdominal obe-
sity. In a recent critique of the literature, Molarius and
Seidell17 called for more rigorously defended theoretical
and biological rationales when identifying anthropomet-
ric indicators for abdominal obesity, such as waist cir-
cumference and waist-hip ratio. Likewise, our findings
underscore the need for future scientific evaluation of an-
thropometric indicators and cutoff points before imple-
menting health care policy.
NEED FOR TAILORED WEIGHT-LOSS
INTERVENTIONS
Based on the less complex algorithm of BMI and CVD
risk factors only, the percentage of adults identified as
needing weight-loss treatment is staggering, especially
among those with lower educational attainment. For in-
stance, among those without a high school degree, more
than 57% of black women and more than 45% of Mexi-
can American women and white women were identified
as needing weight-loss treatment. Yet, a recent report18
indicated that 58% of obese patients (BMI  30) are not
advised by their health care professional to lose weight.
Sociodemographic characteristics appear to influence the
likelihood of being advised to lose weight. For instance,
patients who were either male or had less education were
less likely to have received such advice. According to our
findings, some patients in greatest need of weight-loss
treatment, for instance, 50% of white men and more than
40% of black and Mexican American men who had not
completed high school, would be missed.
Given that both lower educational attainment and
ethnic minority status were related to the need for treat-
ment, innovative tailored treatment programs and
behavioral strategies need to be developed that take lit-
eracy, cultural, and language needs into account. Unfor-
tunately, behavioral weight-loss interventions often are
tailored for white well-educated women,1 the group of
women least likely to be identified as needing weight-
loss treatment in our study. It has been hypothesized that
the content or delivery of existing weight-loss programs
may be less appropriate for some ethnic minority groups,19
perhaps due to differences in perceptions of body image
and attractiveness or other cultural influences.20 Prelimi-
nary studies1,21 described weight-loss programs specifi-
cally designed to be sensitive to educational level and cul-
tural values. However, more research is needed that
systematically evaluates the efficacy of different compo-
nents of such interventions. In addition, further re-
search is needed to examine the efficacy of strategies for
men of all ethnic backgrounds, especially those with less
education.
LIMITATIONS AND STRENGTHS
One limitation of the present study was that 8.7% of the
adults were missing 1 of the 3 assessments (BMI, waist
circumference, or CVD risk factors). Conceivably, the ex-
tremely low percentage of normal-weight adults with a
large waist circumference and 2 or more CVD risk fac-
tors could be due to differential missing data. However,
there were no differences in BMI between those with and
without missing data, making this hypothesis unlikely.
Another limitation is that we only examined how the as-
sessment of a constellation of CVD risk factors (ie, the
presence of  2 CVD risk factors) affected the percent-
age of adults identified for treatment. Future studies need

to investigate how the assessment of individual CVD risk
factors, such as age or smoking status, affect the percent-
age identified for treatment, especially for diverse eth-
nic and socioeconomic groups. A further limitation is that
we only examined CVD risk factors, a fraction of the obe-
sity-associated risk factors recommended for assess-
ment by the panel (eg, gout and gallstones).1 As previ-
ously mentioned, we focused on the CVD risk factors
because of their strong associations with abdominal obe-
sity. One might expect that the percentage of adults iden-
tified for weight-loss treatment might increase with the
addition of other obesity-associated risk factors. How-
ever, the addition of other obesity-associated risk fac-
tors would not affect the findings in the present study
regarding waist circumference, such as the lack of normal-
weight adults with a large waist circumference as de-
fined by the panel.
Despite these limitations, the use of NHANES III to
empirically evaluate the treatment algorithm of the NHLBI
Obesity Education Initiative Expert Panel had a number
of strengths: The 2 largest ethnic minority populations
in the United States, blacks and Mexican Americans, were
oversampled to provide reliable health estimates across
more than 1 ethnic group; the sample included suffi-
cient numbers of men and women aged 25 to 64 years at
the extremes of SES for all ethnic groups; the noninsti-
tutionalized population of the United States was nation-
ally sampled, allowing for broad generalizability; and ob-
jective measures of height, weight, waist circumference,
and some of the primary CVD risk factors (eg, blood pres-
sure and lipoprotein cholesterol level) were used.9
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, this study empirically evaluated the pan-
el's treatment algorithm to identify patients in need of
weight-loss treatment. Although waist circumference is
1 of the 3 key components of the algorithm, it did not
contribute independent information for identifying adults
in need of treatment. The results of this study have im-
portant implications for the use of the panel's treatment
algorithm as currently written but do not negate the po-
tential value of abdominal obesity as an important indi-
cator of disease and mortality.
