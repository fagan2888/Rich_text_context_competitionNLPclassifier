In today's dynamic and competitive environment, customers have numerous choices
to take decision on which products and services to use. In the wireless communications
industry, the introduction of mobile number portability (MNP) may induce more and
more consumers to switch their network operator, as MNP allows consumers to retain
their original telephone number when switching from one carrier to another. This might
have significant effect on price competition and market share of network providers (Shi,
Chiang, & Rhee, 2006).
In this backdrop, the present study examines the effect of MNP on consumers' switching
intentions and also the factors affecting those switching intentions in Indian mobile phone
services context. Further, the study investigates the relationship between switching inten-
tions and actual switching (ASW) or actual staying (AST) behaviour of consumers.
The main findings of the study are:
· After MNP implementation, consumers' switching intentions have not changed, as
they appear to be satisfied with the services of their current service provider and
with regard to those who have already switched, they switched without MNP.
· Factors such as service quality, relational quality (i.e., satisfaction, trust, and commit-
ment), price, reputation and image, attitude towards switching, perceived ease of use
and usefulness, and switching costs (SCs) significantly affect consumers' switching
intentions.
· Consumers'switchingintentionspredictbothASWandASTbehaviourofconsumers.
However, switching intentions better predict AST than ASW behaviour. This implies
that even if consumers have intentions to switch their current operator, they would
not actually switch because of SCs involved in terms of time, money, and effort.
The authors have suggested initiatives that the service providers as well as the Telecom
Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) need to undertake for proper implementation and
acceptance of MNP among consumers.

Summary
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 75
In the past several years, there has been intense
competition in the wireless telecommunications
industry, following an unprecedented increase in
the growth rate. The growth of the wireless telecom-
munications industry is due to the greater number of
subscribers and greater variety of services, namely,
wireline services, wireless services (global system
for mobile communication [GSM] and code division
multiple access [CDMA]), internet services, public
mobile radio trunked services, global mobile personal
communication by satellite (GMPCS), very small aper-
ture terminals (VSATs), mobile value-added services,
etc., that are now offered. In the early stages of market
growth, the emphasis was on acquiring new subscribers
but now as the market has matured, the significance of
retaining current consumers has increased drastically.
Indeed, acquiring new consumers is more difficult and
expensive than retaining the existing consumers, which
is important for manufacturing and services sectors of
an economy (Saeed, Hussain, & Riaz, 2011).
Telecommunication sector is one of the technolog-
ically developed sectors of the Indian economy, as
reported by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
(TRAI). The total number of telephone subscribers
was 621 million in the year 2010, which increased to
951 million in 2012 and 1,048 million in 2013 (Table
1) (Cellular Operators Association of India, n.d.). The
number of wireless subscribers reached 998 million
in 2013, as consumers realized the utility of mobile
services in handling their day-to-day affairs (personal
as well as professional). In response to the introduc-
tion of mobile number portability (MNP), whereby
consumers can retain their mobile number even when
switching to another telecom operator, initially 1
per cent (in 2011) applications were received, which
subsequently increased to 5 per cent (in 2012) and 6
per cent (in 2013) (Table 1). Since consumer switching
has become a critical issue facing mobile service firms,
leading to the relationship dissolution, the debate to
attract and retain consumers has resulted in the devel-
opment of relationship marketing strategies. In this
regard, Duck (1982) explained relationship dissolu-
tion as the permanent dismembership, that is, migra-
tion of users from one service provider to another. In
most services context, consumer switching is associ-
ated with negative consequences such as declining
market share and poor profitability (Keaveney, 1995).
As switching has become a common practice among
mobile users, it assumes additional significance in this
context. To control switching, mobile service providers
are increasingly relying on contracts that would
lock-in consumers for a definite time period, but with
changing competitive dynamics, contracts are not
being favoured by many users (Braff & Laogue, 2004).
Therefore, it becomes important to understand the
fundamental drivers of consumers' switching behav-
iour in the context of mobile services.
MNP allows consumers to retain their telephone
numbers when switching from one service provider
to another. The switching costs (SCs) associated with
subscriber identity module (SIM) have been abolished,
which offers adequate opportunities for the consumers
to choose the service provider that best suits their
telecom needs. MNP is important for telecom markets
because besides removing the barrier to switching, it
has several additional advantages in the Indian context,
where there is an oligopoly structure of telecommu-
nication market and everyone is trying their best to
impress and satisfy immediate subscribers in order to
maintain the number of existing ones and also to attract
potential customers. Therefore, with the introduction
of MNP in India, subscribers can enjoy the freedom of
choice, thereby exiting bad network service provider, as
they can easily make comparison between the services
of few or limited network operators and switch to the
one that best suits their need, without sacrificing their
mobile numbers. However, the success of MNP is likely
to depend on factors such as how simple and inexpen-
sive the implementation of portability is.

76 EXPLORING PREDICTIVE SWITCHING FACTORS FOR MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY
Switching cost reduces the consumers' incentives to
change their network providers, when they are not
satisfied with the existing services. MNP reduces the
cost associated with network switching and thus
eases the burden of consumers, induces more compe-
tition, and helps the new entrants (Armstrong, 1997).
Therefore, it is possible that more and more consumers
get involved in switching their service providers and
this switching behaviour of consumers significantly
affects price competition and market share of network
providers in the wireless/mobile communication
industry (Shi et al., 2006).
As it is clear from Table 2, before MNP, the share of
Bharti Airtel was 28.09 per cent, followed by Vodafone
(22.88%), Idea (15.06%), Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited
(BSNL) (14.99%), Aircel (9.24%), etc. However, with
MNP, most of the large network operators gained
market share (e.g., Bharti Airtel 28.18%, Vodafone
23.01%, Idea 18.82%, and Aircel 9.94%) while the
smaller firms such as Videocon, Mahanagar Telephone
Nigam Limited (MTNL), and Loop mobile struggled
to hold their current market position (Shi et al., 2006).
Consumers who did not like the services of Videocon,
MTNL, etc., switched to get the benefit from MNP.
Several studies have been conducted to investigate the
costs and benefits of MNP, consumer adoption of MNP,
and the effects of MNP on call rates and service quality
(SQ) (Buehler, Dewenter, & Haucap, 2006; Dick & Basu,
1994). With the exception of one study (Shin & Kim,
2008), pertinent previous literature has not examined
consumers' switching intentions with MNP and if in the
past they had intentions to switch their service provider,
how many of them actually switched and what were
the factors behind that switching. Therefore, the present
study explores the factors causing switching intentions
and analyses whether MNP has increased consumers'
switching intentions. The factors predicting consumers'
switching intentions include awareness about MNP
(AAMNP), SQ, satisfaction, trust, commitment, price,
reputation and image, attitude towards switching (ATS),
perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness
(PU), and SCs.
A review of extant pertinent literature reveals that
numerous studies have been conducted by eminent
researchers in the telecom sector but only limited
aspects of customer switching intentions have been
covered. For example, Gerpott, Rams, and Schindler
(2001) demonstrated that overall customer satisfaction
(CS) had a significant impact on customer loyalty (CL),
which in turn influenced a customer's intention to
terminate/extend the contractual relationship with his
mobile cellular network operator. Further, the study
found that mobile service price and personal service
benefit perceptions were the supply-related variables
with the strongest effects on network operator.
However, as the study was confined to CS and CL,
future research can be pursued with customer-side
variables reflecting specific individual customer goals
and motivations in using cellular services. Buehler and
Haucap (2004) examined the consequences of MNP and
revealed that the ultimate effect of introducing MNP

was the abolition of SCs, that is, the cost of changing
SIM card. However, the study was conceptual in
nature and it ignored the empirical effects of MNP
on consumers' switching behaviour. Aydin and Ozer
(2005) suggested a significant relationship between CS,
CL, trust, and SC's sub-constructs in the mobile phone
market. The study tested cause­effect relationships
simultaneously between the variables on the basis of
correlation; in future, these relationships should be
tested by using structural equation modelling (SEM).
Shin and Kim (2008) found that CS, switching barriers,
and demographics significantly affected subscribers'
intention to switch. Among these factors, switching
barriers (positive) had the most significant influence.
However, the study was confined only to the positive
switching barriers and was also limited to intentions;
therefore, future research needs to explore the actual
staying (AST) and switching behaviour of consumers.
Lyons (2009) examined the impact of MNP on mobile
telephonyretailpricesbyusinginternationaltime-series
cross-section data and found that MNPreduced average
prices when the switching process was rapid (less than
five days) but not when it was slower. However, the
study is conceptual in nature. Rahman, Haque, and
Ahmad (2011) determined the factors (i.e., SQ, call rate,
and brand image) of customers' perception towards an
operator and suggested that price and SQ were more
important factors influencing customers' choice of
service provider than brand image. As the study was
conducted in Malaysia, it was felt that similar research
could be conducted in different cultural settings.
Thus, the previous studies were limited to either one
or two aspects of customer switching in mobile phone
services. The proposed study intends to fill this research
gap by examining all the dimensions of customer
switching intentions such as awareness of MNP appli-
cation, SQ, relational quality (RQ), perceived price,
reputation and image of the operator, ATS, PEOU,
PU, and SCs. The study also proposes to find out the
effects of MNP on customers' switching intentions,
which have never been explored earlier. Besides this,
an attempt shall be made to find factors influencing
customers' actual switching (ASW) or AST in mobile
phone services.
HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT
Keaveney (1995) was the first to develop a model of
consumer switching behaviour for service incidents
in which he identified eight incidents, that is, pricing,
inconvenience, core service failures, employees'
response to service failures, attraction by competitors,
ethical problems, involuntary switching, and seldom
mentioned incidents.
In the mobile communication sector, which has
oligopoly characteristics, MNP has increased the
competition, protected the consumers, allowed them
to switch the service provider easier than ever before,
and decreased the cost of changing the provider. In this
regard, Durukan, Bozaci, and Dogan (2011) analysed
the relationship between awareness of MNP and
consumers' switching intentions on the basis of bene-
fits, costs, quality, recent developments, and discounts,
but revealed that there was no relationship between
`awareness of MNP' and `consumers' switching inten-
tions'. Though awareness regarding MNP can assist
consumers in taking appropriate decisions regarding
switching the service provider, consumers shall also
consider economical, relational, technical, and func-
tional factors before deciding in favour of switching
the current network operator. Awareness regarding
MNP can generate understanding about the industry
and help in differentiating between superior and low
quality product so as to keep the market updated and
create awareness of what is happening in the industry;
however, the decision to exit a network operator shall
never solely depend on their awareness regarding MNP.
Hence, the following hypothesis can be formulated.
H1: 
Consumers' MNP awareness has no significant
impact on their switching intentions.
SQ in the telecom industry is an important indicator
to assess a firm's performance. Mobile subscribers
who perceive that operators differ in service levels are
more likely to switch than those who do not see any
difference among networks (Federal Communications
Commission, 2005). In this context, Bansal and Taylor
(1999) revealed that SQ was indirectly related to
consumers' switching intentions via ATS. Similarly,
Bansal, Taylor, and James (2005) asserted that consumers
would switch their existing service provider if they
perceived low SQ. Chen and Wang (2009) analysed the
relationship between core SQ and consumer satisfaction
in insurance sector and revealed that core SQ was a crit-
ical determinant of consumer satisfaction. The higher
level of core SQ increases the level of consumers' satisfac-
tion and decreases their intentions to switch. Also, Shin
and Kim (2008) reported that SQ was indirectly related to
switching intentions via satisfaction and Khan, Ghouri,
Siddqui, Shaikh, and Alam (2010) demonstrated that
78 EXPLORING PREDICTIVE SWITCHING FACTORS FOR MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY
there was a positive relationship between unfavourable
SQ and consumers' switching a bank. Similarly, Anton,
Camarero, and Carrero (2007) indicated that consumers'
perception of poor SQ had a positive effect on termina-
tion intentions. In addition, Hess, Ganesan, and Klein
(2003) concluded that high quality could actually moti-
vate consumers to strengthen the relationship with their
service provider. Further, Huang, Cheng, and Farn (2007)
found that quality helped in promoting consumers'
loyalty and Bell, Auh, and Smalley (2005) indicated that
both technical and functional SQ were positively related
to consumer loyalty. Thus, the following hypothesis can
be formulated.
H2: 
Lower level of SQ significantly leads to higher
consumers' switching intentions.
RQ is an overall construct, which is based on the
previous experiences and impressions the consumer
has with the service provider (Hennig-Thurau & Klee,
1997). Pi and Huang (2011) treated RQ with a service
organization as a second-order latent construct encom-
passing satisfaction, trust, and commitment. Cronin and
Taylor (1992), Oliver and Swan (1989), and Sharma and
Patterson (2000) found that CS had a significant impact
on repurchase intentions in a wide range of services.
Also, Liang, Wang, and Farquhar (2009) provided
empirical evidence that consumer satisfaction was
significantly related to behavioural loyalty in financial
services industry. Trust--the consumer's feeling that
the seller will fulfil his promises--is also an antecedent
of consumers' future behavioural intentions (Garbarino
& Johnson, 1999; Morgan & Hunt, 1994). Trust is also a
strong predictor of commitment, which leads to repur-
chase intentions (Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner, & Gremler,
2002; Sharma & Patterson, 2000). In the context of hair
styling and auto repair services, Bansal et al. (2005)
found a negative relationship between satisfaction,
trust, commitment, and consumers' switching of service
provider. Further, Wetzels, Ruyter, and Birgelen (1998)
reported that commitment was a strong factor, which
enhanced staying intentions. In addition, Lau and
Lee (1999) examined a significant positive association
between customers' trust in brand and their loyalty and
Ranaweera and Prabhu (2003) confirmed that trust had
a significant positive impact on consumer retention.
Hence, the following hypothesis can be formulated.
H3: 
The lower the satisfaction, trust, and commit-
ment towards the service provider, the higher the
consumers' switching intentions.
There are two tendencies with respect to consumers'
perception of the price. The first maintains that
consumers regard high prices as a signal of high quality
and vice versa (Dodds, Monroe, & Grewal, 1991); the
second, in contrast, suggests that low prices can also
function as a signal of good value for money (Kirmani
& Rao, 2000). In either case, whether a low price is
perceived as a low quality or a high price is perceived
as uneconomical, when consumers are dissatisfied
with the value for money or perceive the price to be
unfair, their intentions are stronger to switch the
supplier (Campbell, 1999). In this regard, Keaveney
(1995) suggested that consumers voluntarily switched
suppliers because of their personal dissatisfaction with
the prices they paid. This dissatisfaction arose when
the consumers perceived the price to be unfair or exces-
sively higher than alternative options. Also, Bansal
et al. (2005) indicated that among the reasons why
consumers switched suppliers, price-related issues
were important. Even Khan et al. (2010) concluded that
price positively influenced consumer switching behav-
iour. Similarly, Anton et al. (2007) demonstrated that
consumers' perception of paying an unfair price for
the service positively affected their intention to exit the
relationship. Therefore, the following hypothesis can
be formulated.
H4: 
Unfavourable perception of price has a positive
impact on consumers' switching intentions.
Reputation has been described as a social identity and
an important intangible resource that can significantly
contribute to a firm's performance and its survival (Rao,
1994). It is a key asset to firms, as it is valuable, distinc-
tive, difficult to duplicate, non-substitutable, and it
provides the firm with a sustainable competitive advan-
tage (Wang, Lo, & Hui, 2003). In this context, Muffatto
and Panizzolo (1995) indicated that reputation played a
key role in measuring consumer satisfaction and thus, it
was identified as a key ingredient to retain consumers in
the services sector. Also, Wang et al. (2003) revealed that
the quality of product/service benefited not only by
lowering costs but also by increasing competitiveness
through the establishment of a good reputation and
attraction and retention of consumers. Bloemer, Ruyter,
and Peeters (1998) found that image was indirectly
related to loyalty via perceived quality, whereas Awang
(2010) demonstrated that corporate reputation was indi-
rectly related to competitive advantage via perceived
value and perceived quality of the service. Further,
Khan et al. (2010) examined a positive relationship
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 79
between unfavourable bank reputation and consumers'
switching of a bank. Thus, the following hypothesis can
be formulated.
H5: Unfavourable reputation of service provider signifi-
cantly influences consumers' switching intentions.
The role of one's ATS in predicting intentions to switch
remains unexplored in mobile services or telecom
sector. Generally, the more favourable the attitude is
with respect to the behaviour in question, the stronger
is an individual's intention to perform that behav-
iour (Ajzen, 1999). In the context of mortgage services,
Bansal and Taylor (1999) revealed that ATS was the
most influential determinant of switching intentions,
which was influenced by subjective norms, conse-
quentially influencing consumers' switching inten-
tions. Bansal and Taylor (1999, 2002) also concluded
that attitudes towards switching were associated
with consumers' switching intentions. Thus, a person
holding favourable ATS will be more likely to switch
his current service provider (Desbarats, 1983). Hence,
the following hypothesis can be formulated.
H6: Positive ATS significantly leads to strong switching
intentions.
Perceived usefulness is often regarded as a concept that
includes components such as effectiveness, efficiency,
availability, sociability, reassurance, and instrumen-
tality (Leung & Wei, 2000). PEOU refers to the degree
of effort that consumers associate with using a mobile
service (Davis, 1989). In this regard, Hung, Ku, and
Chang (2003) revealed that PEOU influenced intentions
to use mobile services. In addition, Nysveen, Pederson,
and Thorbjornsen (2005) concluded that there was
a strong and direct effect of PU and PEOU on inten-
tions to use goal-directed mobile services. Davis (1989)
also indicated that PEOU positively influenced PU,
suggesting that only if the mobile services were easy
to use, the consumers would be able to take advantage
of all the possible benefits of the goal-directed services.
Thus, PEOU and PU are important motivations for
using mobile services. Hence, the following hypothesis
can be formulated.
H7: 
PEOU and PU are significant factors determining
consumers' switching intentions.
Switching costs are defined as those costs that
consumers associate with the process of switching
from one supplier to another (Burnham, Frels, &
Mahajan, 2003; Wathne, Biong, & Heide, 2001). Jones,
Mothersbaugh, and Beatty (2000) and Ping (1993)
established a direct relationship between SCs and
repurchase intentions. Lee and Cunningham (2001)
found a significant impact of SC variables on service
loyalty and concluded that service loyalty was not only
determined by perceived SQ, but also by cost consid-
eration that arose from present transaction and future
switching possibilities. Burnham et al. (2003) affirmed
that SCs drove consumers' intention to stay with their
current service provider. If SCs are low, dissatisfac-
tion with the SQ, price, or firm will motivate the inten-
tion to switch suppliers (Bansal et al., 2005). Anton et
al. (2007) also found that SCs are indirectly related to
consumers' switching intention via SQ, commitment,
price, and anger incidents. Bansal and Taylor (1999)
revealed that there is a direct relationship between SCs
and consumers' switching intentions. More recently,
Shin and Kim (2008) indicated that switching barriers
are the key factors in subscribers' switching intentions.
Thus, the following hypothesis can be formulated.
H8: 
The lower the SCs, the higher the consumers'
switching intentions.
A critical factor in the Theory of Planned Behaviour
(TPB) is an individual's intention to perform a particular
behaviour. Behavioural intentions are considered to be
a critical factor in explaining consumers' actual behav-
iour, where an individual's strong intention to perform
certain behaviour is likely to result in its performance
(Ajzen, 1991). The evidence for prediction of behaviour
from intentions can be found in the applications of the
Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and TPB in several
behavioural contexts (Ajzen & Driver, 1992; East, 1993).
In this context, Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) insisted that
most individual's behaviour was predictably based on
his/her intentions. Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman
(1996) also demonstrated that a favourable intention
to switch predicted ASW. Further, Bansal and Taylor
(1999) revealed that the stronger the consumers' inten-
tion to switch the service provider, the more likely they
were to engage in switching behaviour. Hence, the
following hypothesis can be formulated.
H9: 
Consumers' switching intentions significantly
influence their ASW.
Changing consumer preferences and spending
patterns influence consumers behaviour. For example,
Beckett, Hewer, and Howcroft (2000) found that bank
consumers transferred their account to alternative
80 EXPLORING PREDICTIVE SWITCHING FACTORS FOR MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY
providersbecauseofchangedlifestyle,suchasmarriage
or shifting of house. Abratt and Russel (1999) showed
that price followed by trust, SQ, and firm, being avail-
able at a time of crisis, were the most important criteria
in the selection of a private bank. In contrast, Riggal
(1980) confirmed that the convenience factor was most
important for bank consumers followed by friends'
suggestions and low service charges. In addition,
Zeithaml et al. (1996) demonstrated the existence of a
positive relationship between commitment and behav-
ioural intentions, which implied greater chances of
AST behaviour. Moreover, consequences of relation-
ship efforts on consumers' behavioural intentions can
be viewed as signals of retention or defection (Liang
& Wang, 2007). Thus, the following hypothesis can
be formulated.
H10: 
Consumers' switching intentions have a negative
impact on their AST.
One important source of constraints that consumers
face in the case of switching-related behaviours
is perceived SCs, which makes it costly for the
consumers to switch to another supplier (Fornell,
1992; Fornell & Wernerfelt, 1987). For example, Bansal
and Taylor (1999) demonstrated that the lower the
SCs, the more successfully consumers were predicted
to engage in switching behaviour. In the context of
banks, Ghouri et al. (2010) analysed the relationship
between unfavourable perceptions of price, unfa-
vourable bank reputation, poor SQ, low SCs, and
consumers' switching, and found that there existed
a positive and significant relationship between these
factors and consumer's switching. Sathish, Kumar,
Naveen, and Jeevanantham (2011) revealed that poor
network coverage, frequent network problems, high
call rates, and influence from family and friends were
the most important factors affecting switching behav-
iour of consumers. However, Durukan et al. (2011)
demonstrated that there was no relationship between
the awareness of consumers regarding MNP and their
switching. Bansal et al. (2005) asserted that service
switching was influenced less by consumer evalua-
tion of service provider characteristics and service
experience than by alternative attractiveness as well
as personal and social factors. Holloway, Wang, and
Beatty (2009) found that following a failed service
recovery, consumers with high relationship quality
would experience a greater decline in their intentions
to repurchase from the service provider in the future.
Keaveney (1995) also publicized that core service
failures, service encounter failures, and inconvenience
caused consumers to switch services. Further, Shin and
Kim (2008) revealed that higher levels of perceived
switching barriers were associated with higher
levels of switching behaviour, whereas Wieringa and
Verhoef (2007) found lower relationship quality to be
significantly related to more switching. Therefore, the
following hypothesis can be formulated.
H11a: 
Various predictive switching factors (namely,
awareness of MNP application, SQ, RQ,
perceived price, reputation and image of the
operator, ATS, PEOU, and PU and SCs) signifi-
cantly influence ASW.
Customer loyalty is defined as consumer's intent to stay
with an organization (Zeithaml et al., 1996). Perceived
SQ, CS, and loyalty have been identified as key factors
in banking and other service industries (Dick & Basu,
1994; Lewis, 1993). In this context, Bloemer et al. (1998)
revealed that image of a bank did not have a direct
positive effect on loyalty while quality had a direct and
indirect effect on loyalty, where the indirect influence
was via satisfaction. De Matos, Henrique, and Rosa
(2009) found that SC was a significant antecedent of
both attitudinal and behavioural loyalty, with a strong
influence on attitudinal loyalty. Yen (2010) showed that
high perceived risk affected the relationship of SCs
and consumer loyalty. Jones et al. (2000) observed that
stronger interpersonal relationships were associated
with higher repurchase intentions. Bell et al. (2005)
found that the effect of technical SQ on consumer
loyalty was much greater than the effect of func-
tional SQ. Dongjin, Shenghui, and Kai (2008) stated
that perceived value positively influenced consumers'
repurchase intentions. Goala (2007) reported that calcu-
lative commitment resisted switching when there were
inappropriate employee responses to service failures,
a pricing problem, and a service encounter failure. In
addition, Seo, Ranganathan, and Babad (2008) found
that more complex service plan, more sophisticated
handset, longer consumer association, and higher
connectivity quality of wireless were positively related
to consumer retention behaviour. Hence, the following
hypothesis can be formulated.
H11b: 
Various predictive switching factors (namely,
awareness of MNP application, SQ, RQ,
perceived price, reputation and image of the
operator, ATS, PEOU, and PU and SCs) signifi-

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The present study examines the factors that lead to
consumers' switching intentions from one mobile
service provider to another after the introduction of
MNP. The data were collected through structured
instrument.Theitemsofvariousconstructsintheinstru-
ment, covering all the aspects of consumers switching
intentions in mobile telecommunication services, were
extracted from the previous literature (Exhibit 1).

To enhance the validity of the proposed model, a
pretest was conducted before the final survey. For pilot
testing, students of a North Indian university were
contacted on convenience basis. After analysing the
data collected through pilot survey, it was realized that
one item of SC, namely, `don't know what we will end
up having to deal with while switching', was found
ambiguous and therefore not considered for final
survey. Thereafter, the instrument was finalized, which
consisted of demographic profile, general information,
and various aspects of consumer switching intentions.
A 5-point Likert scale ranging from `strongly agree'
(5) to `strongly disagree' (1) was employed for each
item. For the final survey, the respondents were the
regular postgraduate students of the same university,
considering that youngsters are always in search of
new services being introduced in the market, have
complete awareness, and are adaptive about these
new services/offerings (Amin, Ahmad, & Huib, 2012).
They like creativity and innovation and easily move
from one product to another. In fact, preferring new
and innovative product is the core attribute associated
with youngsters (Stanton, Michael, & Bruce, 1994). On
the contrary, entrepreneurs, professionals, salaried
persons, and senior citizens are less interested in new/
innovative/value-added services being introduced, as
they use their mobile phones mainly for professional
purposes. These students were selected after obtaining
department-wise list of students from the nodal
section of the university and thereafter arranging all
the departments in an alphabetical order. According to
the list, the total number of regular students as on 31
December 2011 was 2,804. After arranging departments
alphabetically, the sample size was calculated using the
formula given by Burns and Bush (2006, p. 378) and the
sample size obtained was 260. Out of 260 students, who
were personally approached, 242 returned properly
filled-in instruments, thus providing a response rate of
93.07 per cent.
Outliers were detected and removed before analysing
the data. Normality of the data was also established,
82 EXPLORING PREDICTIVE SWITCHING FACTORS FOR MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY
as normality is a pre-requisite for many statistical tests.
In order to find out the perceptual gap between two
groups of telecommunication consumers (i.e., male
and female; prepaid and post-paid; consumers who
switched with MNP or without MNP), independent
samples t-test was applied. Confirmatory factor anal-
ysis (CFA) was used to test the adequacy of the meas-
urement model (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). The
adequacy of the measurement model was evaluated
on the criteria of convergent validity, discriminant
validity, and reliability. Finally, for testing the hypoth-
eses, SEM was used, which is a comprehensive statis-
tical approach to test relationships among observed
and latent variables (Hoyle, 1995).
ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
A preliminary analysis of the data revealed that the
final sample consisted of 231 students (after removing
11 outliers), out of which 36 per cent were males and
remaining females; 29 per cent students were from pure
sciences and 71 per cent from non-sciences. Further,
considering previous qualification, 43 per cent had BA,
37 per cent had BSc and 13 per cent BCom (Table 3).
Among these students, Airtel had the maximum
number of subscribers (28%), followed by Aircel (22%),
Vodafone (21%), Reliance (10%), etc. The reasons
for being attached to their current service provider
included better network coverage, low call rates,
and low internet charges. About 88 per cent sampled
students had prepaid connections and 44 per cent had
already switched their previous service provider--16
per cent respondents switched from Airtel and among
them, only 5 per cent switched with MNP and 40 per
cent without MNP. When asked about the reasons for
not adopting MNP, 28 per cent expressed unavaila-
bility at that time, 17 per cent felt that the MNP process
was time-consuming, and 11 per cent did not adopt
because of inconvenience caused by MNP and lack
of information about it. Further, 29 per cent telecom
users wanted to switch their current service provider
in the future and they intended to subscribe to the
services of BSNL (a government organization). Most
of the respondents (71%) did not want to switch their
service provider (Khan, Shaikh, & Shah, 2012) just
because they were content with their services, call
rates, network coverage, etc.

In order to weed out the perceptual gap between two
groups, independent samples t-test was applied. The
results of t-test reveal that there exists no significant
difference in the opinions of male and female, prepaid
and post-paid consumers, and also the consumers who
switched with MNP and without MNP with regard to
factors predicting consumers' switching/staying inten-
tions, as significance two-tailed value is above 0.05 for
majority of these factors (Table 4).

86 EXPLORING PREDICTIVE SWITCHING FACTORS FOR MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY
A CFA was conducted through AMOS (16.0), using
maximum-likelihood estimation (Joreskog & Sorbom,
1993), on the major factors of consumers' switching
intentions (Table 4). In order to assess the fitness of
the models, multiple fit indices have been reported,
namely, 2/df, goodness of fit index (GFI), adjusted
goodness of fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index
(CFI), normed-fit index (NFI), Tucker­Lewis index
(TLI), Root Mean Square Residual (RMR), and root
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). All
these indices reveal that measurement models are
reasonably consistent with the data, that is, 2/df is
less than 5.00; GFI, AGFI, CFI, NFI, and TLI are more
than 0.90; RMR and RMSEA are less than 0.08 (Bentler,
1990; Taylor & Todd, 1995) (Table 5). The validity and
reliability of the measures were assessed through
standardized regression weights (SRWs) and variance
extracted (Table 6). Construct validity of each construct
was calculated as it directly affected the substan-
tive models being tested (Bagozzi & Edwards, 1998).
Factor loadings above 0.50 are generally considered
the minimal level at which convergent validity could
be suggested (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988) and in the present
study, convergent validity of each construct gets estab-
lished, as majority of loadings are above 0.50 (Table
6). Another criterion being used for assessing conver-
gent validity is average variance extracted (AVE),
which came out to be above 0.50 (Table 7). In addition
to assessing the validity of the measure, reliability of
each construct was assessed through Cronbach's alpha
co-efficient and the value above 0.70 signifies that the
data are reliable (Nunnally, 1978).

Another way of establishing reliability is through
composite reliability (CR), which came out to be above
0.90, thus indicating the internal consistency of the
data (Table 7). Discriminant validity can be statistically
demonstrated using a Chi-square difference test to each
of the possible pairs of the measurement scales. The
results of the test reveal that for all the pairs of construct,
the Chi-square values are significant at 0.05 level (2 >
3.84, df = 1), thereby indicating discriminant validity
of constructs in all possible pairings (Ahire, Golhar, &
Waller, 1996). As the correlation matrix reveals a high
degree of relationship among the factors predicting
consumers' switching intentions, discriminant validity
could not be established by comparing AVE of the
construct with the squared correlation between the
pair of constructs (Table 8). Since most of the correla-
tion coefficients are above 0.50, theoretical restrictions
in achieving discriminant validity are obvious.

88 EXPLORING PREDICTIVE SWITCHING FACTORS FOR MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY
Table 6 shows the direct effects of predictive switching
factors on the switching intentions, AST, and ASW. The
results reveal that the highest contributing variable
towards switching intentions and AST/ASW is trust (SI:
0.95, ASW:0.703, AST: -0.782). Hence, trust towards the
service provider plays a significant role in influencing
not only the switching intentions but also AST and ASW.
To test the hypothesized relationships in the model
(Figure 1), SEM was conducted using AMOS (16.0). The
structural model was examined to test the hypotheses
depicting relationship among constructs (Table 9). It
becomes evident from the SEM results that consumers'
awareness regarding MNP has no effect on their inten-
tions to switch the current operator ( = 0.16, p = 0.018);

thus, H1 stands accepted. This implies that consumers
with complete information regarding MNP do not
intend to switch current operator, possibly, because of
switching barriers (i.e., SCs). In this context, Durukan
et al. (2011) revealed that there was no meaningful
relationship between `awareness about MNP' and
`switching intentions'. Besides the proposed model,
two other models, namely, formative model and high-
order formative model, were also tested. The fit indices
reveal that the proposed model is the best fit model as
compared to the other two models (Table 9).

It is again clear from the SEM results that lower SQ
significantly influences consumers' switching inten-
tions ( = 0.91, p = 0.00); hence, H2 is also accepted. In
this regard, Saeed et al. (2011) demonstrated a positive
association between poor SQ and switching intentions.
The SEM analysis further reveals that low satisfaction (
= 0.93), low trust ( = 0.95), and low commitment ( =
0.86) are the significant factors influencing consumers'
switching intentions. Hence, on the basis of these results,
H3 stands accepted. The negative relationship between
satisfaction with a service provider and switching inten-
tions is well established (e.g., Bansal & Taylor, 1999;
Cronin, Brady, & Hult, 2000). This signifies that if a
consumer is not satisfied with the services of his/her
network operator, then he/she may think of leaving that
service provider. Also, if consumers trust the products/
services of their current service provider, their inten-
tion to switch that service provider is low. In this regard,
Anton et al. (2007) revealed a significant relationship
between low commitment towards service provider and
switching intentions. This explains that if consumers are
highly committed to their service provider, their inten-
tion to leave that service provider is also low.
The direct effect of unfavourable prices on consumers'
switching intentions ( = 0.90) is significant and posi-
tive, which also leads to the acceptance of this hypoth-
esis (H4). Hence, when consumers are dissatisfied with
the value for money or perceive the price to be unfair,
their intentions will be stronger to switch the service
provider (Campbell, 1999).
The results of SEM analysis also depict that unfa-
vourable reputation significantly affects consumers'
switching intentions ( = 0.91); therefore, H5 also
stands accepted. Hence, consumers are more inclined
to purchase the product/services of those companies
whom they perceive as having favourable reputation
among their competitors (Nguyen & Leblanc, 2001).
It also becomes clear from SEM results that consumers'
positiveATS significantly predicts their switching inten-
tions ( = 0.51, p = 0.00), which leads to the acceptance
of H6. This finds support from Bansal and Taylor (1999),
who stated that ATS was the most influential determi-
nant of switching intentions. Hence, if a consumer is
holding favourable ATS, he/she will be more likely to
switch his current service provider (Desbarats, 1983).
The model further explains that PEOU ( = 0.91) and
PU ( = 0.86) significantly predict consumers' switching
from one service provider to another, which supports
H7. Thus, when consumers perceive the services of
current operator as easy to use, their intentions to
leave the provider will be low and, in contrast, if they
perceive that services are difficult to use, they intend to
switch current operator (Nysveen et al., 2005).
The SEM results also justify that lower SCs signifi-
cantly lead to higher consumers' switching intentions
( = ­0.82, p = 0.00); therefore, H8 stands accepted. This
demonstrates that if SCs are low, consumers' switching
intentions will be high. The direct effect of consumers'
switching intentions on ASW behaviour of consumers
is also significant and positive ( = 0.59), which leads
to the acceptance of H9. This implies that if consumers
have strong intention to leave their service provider,
may be because of low SQ, unfavourable prices, low
commitment, etc., they will definitely switch the current
operator. The consequences of relationship efforts on
consumers' behavioural intentions can be viewed as
signals of retention or defection (Liang & Wang, 2007).
Again, it is clear from SEM analysis that consumers'
switching intentions negatively influence AST
90 EXPLORING PREDICTIVE SWITCHING FACTORS FOR MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY
behaviour of consumers or their loyalty with current
operator ( = ­0.91, p = 0.00). All this leads to the
acceptance of H10. If consumers are very much satisfied
with the quality and pricing of services, their intention
to leave current operator decreases, which signifies
consumers' loyalty with their operator.
However, SEM analysis depicts that except for
`trust towards the service provider', other predic-
tive switching factors do not significantly contribute
towards ASW and AST behaviour of consumers; hence
H11a and H11b stand rejected. The results reveal that
predictive switching factors do not have direct signif-
icant effect on ASW or AST behaviour; this relation-
ship is fully mediated by the switching intentions
of the consumers. On the contrary, Khan et al. (2010)
stated that there was a significant relationship between
unfavourable perception of price, unfavourable bank
reputation, poor SQ, low SCs on the one hand and
consumers switching behaviour on the other. Further,
according to Holloway et al. (2009), following a failed
service recovery, consumers with high relationship
quality would experience a greater decline in their
intentions to repurchase from the service provider in
the future.
After running SEM, it was found that the overall fit
measures provided a good fit for the hypothesized
causal model (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988; Baumgartner &
Homburg, 1996). The GFI (0.915), AGFI (0.869), RMSEA
(0.07) and RMSR (0.03) are all within the acceptable
range. The other indices like NFI, CFI, and TLI are all
above 0.90. As these values are above 0.90, it can be
concluded that the model exhibits a reasonable fit to
the data (Table 9).
CONCLUSION
The availability of a number of subscriber options for
consumers and varied tariff rates of each player moti-
vate the consumers to switch between service providers.
MNP permits to switch operators without changing
his/her telephone number. The present study focuses
on consumers' switching intentions after the introduc-
tion of MNP, factors affecting consumers' switching
intentions, and also the relationship between switching
intentions and ASW or AST behaviour of consumers.
The findings of the present study reveal that after the
implementation of MNP, consumers' switching inten-
tions have not enhanced, as they appear to be satisfied
with the services of their current service provider; those
who have already switched, did so without MNP. Also,
the consumers, who intend to switch their operator in
future, want to do so without MNP, as MNP involves
too much cost, time, and effort.
The study findings also reveal that the factors such as
SQ, RQ (i.e., satisfaction, trust, and commitment), price,
reputation and image, ATS, PEOU and PU, and SCs
significantly affect consumers' switching intentions
(Bansal & Taylor, 2002; Davis, 1989; Hess et al., 2003;
Ping, 1993). The study has also examined the relation-
ship between AAMNP application and switching inten-
tions and the result finds no significant relationship
between the two, a finding that is also supported by
Durukan et al. (2011). Along with this, the study find-
ings demonstrate that various switching factors signif-
icantly affect ASW and AST behaviour of consumers
(Holloway et al., 2009; Yen, 2010).
The study suggests that consumers' switching intentions
predict both ASW and AST behaviour of consumers.
However, switching intentions better predict AST, that
is, consumer loyalty, more than ASW behaviour. This
implies that even if consumers have intentions to switch
their current operator, they would not switch because
of SCs involved in terms of time, money, and effort.
This is consistent with the findings of Chuang (2011)
who found that SC was the most significant factor for
retaining the subscribers. Thus, it can be concluded that
with the introduction of MNP, consumers' switching
intentions have not increased and most of them want to
remain with their current operator.
MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS
In order to develop socially desirable, legally justifiable,
industrially feasible, and economically viable policy,
it is advised that regulators should not only enforce
MNP, but they should try to reduce the switching
barriers and enhance consumers' awareness of MNP,
so that subscribers can take advantage of this system.
By understanding consumers' switching intentions,
regulators can ensure MNP's effective implementa-
tion, which will also make it more convenient for end
users to switch current operator if the services do not
meet their expectations. Thus, government as well as
telecom operators should organize programmes, semi-
nars, informative advertisements, and other commu-
nication activities about the MNP system to help in
shortening and simplifying the procedure of reaching
the MNP targets. The operators should open separate
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 91
counters in their retail outlets for providing informa-
tion to each and every consumer about the benefits and
costs of MNP service.
The results of the study reveal that the factor contrib-
uting more towards ASW is the `trust towards the
service provider'; therefore, the service provider
should extend consistent and reliable services so that
the consumers repose confidence in that network oper-
ator. Also these operators should resort to improving
SQ, reducing prices (call rates), providing more value-
added services, etc., as a mechanism to retain the
current base of consumers. This shall also improve the
future prospects of the service provider in the long run.
Delaying tactics and other measures used by the operator
to prevent the consumers from switching implies that he
or she is not properly implementing the MNP services.
The government should issue show cause notice to these
operators on violating the laws relating to MNP. TRAI
should identify some possible measures to improve
communication between the parties involved in the
MNP process. One way to improve this communication
is to reduce the amount of messages being exchanged
between the recipient and the donors, for example, by
combining execution and validation messages. The
study also reveals that one reason why the consumers
are not adopting MNP is the paper work involved that
consumes too much of their time. To avoid this problem,
TRAI should define the stages in the porting process
so that operators do not misuse their position to create
unnecessary delays.At present, very few telecom compa-
nies provide MNP services in India; hence, the govern-
ment should take necessary steps or frame strict policies
regarding mandatory introduction of MNP. The adminis-
trative arrangement of the porting process should also be
taken up by the government, as administrative arrange-
ment is equally important like the technical arrangement,
which includes porting time, porting charges, etc. Also
the poorly designed systems, which are very complex
or easily abused, take away the benefits that the MNP
is supposed to deliver. TRAI should also fix time limits
for the validation process, as majority of the respondents
face problems because of the time-consuming process
involved in porting. As the AAMNP is generated mainly
through advertisements, friends, and relatives, it is advis-
able that telecom operators should offer discounts and
other incentives to the person who motivates his relatives
and friends to avail MNP.
The present study demonstrates various factors
affecting consumers' switching intentions; hence, the
operators should attempt to strengthen these switching
factors in order to prevent customers from exiting.
Telecom companies should train their sales personnel
for promoting new products or services, and educating
and informing consumers about the new offerings so
that they can avail these services with proper informa-
tion and knowledge.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
The study is conducted with limited factors affecting
consumers' switching intentions, thereby excluding
some more factors, namely, attractiveness of alterna-
tives, subjective norms, service affordability, promo-
tional offers, etc. The results of the study indicate that
most of the consumers have switched from private
network operator to BSNL and would prefer to
subscribe to the services of BSNL in future. Therefore,
research should be conducted to find out the reasons
for not trusting private network operators. Our current
understanding of SCs is limited to the costs involved
in switching from current service provider to the new
one. Future research should examine how costs associ-
ated with returning to the origin affect the decision to
leave in the first place, especially in case of contractual
agreements such as BSNL. The results also reveal that
consumers do not favour MNP for switching their oper-
ators because companies follow delaying tactics or do
not provide unique portability code. Therefore, another
study should be conducted to investigate why compa-
nies are not implementing MNP properly. The concept
of portability has also been recently introduced in health
insurance sector. Therefore, all insurers issuing health
insurance policies will allow for credit gained by the
insured for pre-existing conditions in terms of waiting
period when a policyholder switches from one insurer
to another or from one plan to another, provided the
previous policy has been maintained without break.
Thus, future research can also be conducted in health
insurance sector.
