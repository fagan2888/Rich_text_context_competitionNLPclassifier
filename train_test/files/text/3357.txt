Speculative Animation: Digital
Projections of Urban Past and
Future
Joel McKim
Birkbeck, University of London, UK
Abstract
This article explores the growing presence of digital animation within the work of contemporary
visual artists, architects and designers concerned with urban geography. While contemporary
theorists such as Bernard Stiegler and Mark Hansen have emphasized the ways in which digital
media technologies have colonized cultural memory and foreclosed access to a collectively
envisioned future, socially engaged architects and artists have turned to animation as a medium that
retains an important aesthetic potential. Digital animation has thus become a primary method for
both envisioning alternative urban futures and reconstructing the traumatic past within politically
engaged work. This article focuses on four examples, two past and two future-oriented. The
conceptual artist Stan Douglas has recently, and uncharacteristically, adopted digital animation and
gaming technologies in his Circa 1948 collaboration with the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).
The interactive app allows Douglas to re-activate a repressed period of Vancouver's past, thereby
questioning the narratives of progress and property speculation that dominate the contemporary
city. The work of Eyal Weizman and the Forensic Architecture project has increasingly involved
the use of digital animation techniques to both reconstruct and visualize key dates or events
within moments of humanitarian crisis. In the Rafah: Black Friday case study, for example, digital
animation and 3D modelling are used to reconstruct a particularly intense four days of bombing
during the 2014 Israeli military offensive in Gaza. The artist Larissa Sansour merges live action
and digital animation to visually depict bleak and disturbingly convincing Palestinian futures, and
the `speculative architect' Liam Young has been employing animation techniques to present urban
scenarios that teeter between the technologically utopian and dystopian.

... the exhaustion of the future does not even leave us with the past. (Mark Fisher, 2009: 3)
The very unfortunate recent passing of cultural theorist Mark Fisher was met with a level of wide-
spread grief that confirmed the resonance and impact of his writing. A consistent and powerful
refrain within Fisher's many books, essays and blog posts is the sense that meaningful access to a
past and a future beyond the daily experience of contemporary life has been effectively foreclosed.
In an increasingly financialized and digitized world, Fisher laments the diminished collective abil-
ity to establish either long-term memory or an alternative vision of what is to come. Current obses-
sions with `the new'mask deeper indications of cultural inertia, according to Fisher, and significant
change in late-capitalism has become difficult to imagine, let alone enact. He therefore observes in
Ghosts of My Life: Writings on Depression, Hauntology and Lost Futures (2014: 8) that `the slow
cancellation of the future has been accompanied by a deflation of expectations.' Nowhere has this
sense of temporal and political impotence been more pronounced, I would argue, than in contem-
porary urban life ­ the instability and displacement produced by property speculation and large-
scale development projects has all but dismantled long-standing communities and prevented the
public from being meaningfully involved in imagining the future trajectory of their cities. Looking
forward or backward is a temporal luxury most urban dwellers in major cities cannot afford as they
busy themselves with navigating the financial challenges of the immediate present.
Once regarded as possible tools for resisting these forms of destabilization, cotemporary digital
media technologies are now more often assumed to be complicit in the intensification of these very
processes. This article will begin by outlining a prominent strand of media philosophy that empha-
sizes the role that digital technologies have played in blocking access to our collective past and cur-
tailing our ability to project forward into the future. Media theorists Bernard Stiegler and Mark BN
Hansen have highlighted the `non-phenomenological' or `non-experiential' nature of contemporary
media ­ the tendency of increasingly data-driven and corporatized digital technologies to condition
our surrounding environment without being fully available to us as representations. These new forms
of digital media, Stiegler and Hansen argue, attempt to instrumentalize our past and predetermine our
future. While remaining cognizant of the temporal warnings issued by these thinkers, this article will
nevertheless argue that we should not overlook the potential of digital media, and digital animation
in particular, to productively intervene in the development of new urban imaginaries. If digital infor-
mation is, as Stiegler and Hansen suggest, fundamentally inaccessible to our senses, then the impor-
tance of digital animation (a medium essentially defined by its translation of digital information into
representational form) is arguably increasing rather than diminishing. This article will focus on the
adoption of digital animation techniques by a growing field of artists, designers and architects con-
cerned with re-potentializing and re-politicizing urban pasts and futures. In the hands of these artists
and architects, animation becomes a tool for both visualizing digital information and accessing tem-
poral registers beyond the restrictive confines of the immediate present. I will highlight here two
examples of animation-based projects directed towards the past ­ artist Stan Douglas's recreation of
a forgotten period of Vancouver's urban history and Forensic Architecture's use of digital techniques
to document unacknowledged urban atrocities ­ as well as two projects oriented towards the future
­ artist Larissa Sansour's dystopian projections of a Palestinian future and `speculative architect'
Liam Young's explorations of a coming techno-urbanity.1
Philosophies of non-experiential media
Media philosophers Bernard Stiegler and Mark BN Hansen both identify a paradox at the heart of
contemporary media experience. While the digital encroaches into ever more facets of everyday life,
our current networked environments and computational media often operate below the threshold of
McKim 289
our perception. Digital media, in other words, is everywhere in the contemporary world, yet it
remains in important ways at a distance from us. Stiegler and Hansen, each in his own way, high-
light the lack of direct access to digital media in two interrelated respects: firstly, that computa-
tional media or data is increasingly unavailable to our senses and is operating on a temporal scale
that is machine rather than human-oriented; and secondly, that contemporary media is made inac-
cessible to us through its structures of ownership, storage and processing. While we all contribute
to an accumulating reservoir of digital information through our participation in social media plat-
forms, communication networks and online transactions, the ability to access this data pool and
make this information actionable is reserved for those few companies and institutions with consid-
erable algorithmic and analytical resources at their disposal. This situation of participation without
access that characterizes our current digital media environments is important for this particular
discussion because, as Stiegler and Hansen outline, it has implications for our formation and pres-
ervation of cultural memory and our ability to effectively imagine the future.
Although Stiegler has been considering the relationship between memory, technology and human
life since the 1990s (the first of his multi-volume Technics and Time being published in French in
1994), his impact on considerations of media and politics is on the ascendance withinAnglo scholar-
ship. This is due in part to the growing number of English translations of his work, but also to the
sense that his system of thought appears increasingly prescient and relevant in the context of our
contemporary networked digital environments. One of Stiegler's consistent theoretical preoccupa-
tions is the impact of exteriorized and technologically-based memory systems on the development
of individual and collective life. More specifically, Stiegler (2009a: 97) is concerned with `the
industrialization of memory' that occurs when the symbols, images and sounds available to us are
increasingly provided by commercialized culture industries. Stiegler calls these exteriorized or pros-
thetic forms of memory `tertiary retentions', which he further defines as `memory support objects
and mnemotechniques that make the recording of traces possible ­ notably those photograms, pho-
nograms, cinematograms, videograms, and digital technologies that form the technological infra-
structure of the societies of control in the hyper-industrial epoch' (Stiegler, 2011: 57).
Stiegler's position, while highly critical, is certainly not a call for a return to some kind of mythic
pre-technological age, for he insists that humans are technical beings from the start.As Hansen (2006:
299) notes, `Stiegler argues for the co-originarity of technics and the human, in the sense that the
break giving rise to the human as a distinct species simply is the invention of technics.'Tertiary reten-
tions, or mnemotechniques, also pre-date the current industrial age in material and symbolic technical
systems ranging from libraries to the alphabet itself. These tertiary retentions are the means by which
human knowledge and experience are transmitted through time and passed on intergenerationally, a
process Stiegler (1994: 175) refers to as `epiphylogenesis'. The imperative for considering the rela-
tionship between humans and their technical supports at the present moment, according to Stiegler, is
due to both the current `speed of technical evolution' (p. 17) and the transformation of these new
distributed memory infrastructures into systems of control through their entry into the logic of the
industrial economy. He thus writes in the first volume of Symbolic Misery (2014: 6):
Being increasingly constituted by images and sounds that the media streams through my consciousness, as
well as by objects (and relationships with these objects) that these images lead me to consume, my past is
less and less differentiated from that of other people. It loses, therefore, its singularity, which is as much
as to say, I lose myself as singularity.
Stiegler's image of an increasingly undifferentiated and homogenized collective past brings to
mind relatively easily the scrolling timelines, sponsored content and accumulating databases of
contemporary social media platforms.
290 animation: an interdisciplinary journal 12(3)
The colonization of tertiary or prosthetic memory by economic or industrial forces is crucial to
Stiegler precisely because of its growing influence on the forms of internalized perception (what
he calls primary retentions) and memory (secondary retentions) that enable the formation of indi-
vidual and collective identity. Stiegler describes a kind of retentional chain reaction, in which the
increasingly dominant presence of industrialized tertiary retentions (now almost exclusively taking
the form of online digital media) begins to condition our individual and collective forms of second-
ary retention, our individual and cultural memory. Our secondary retentions affect in turn the pro-
cess of primary retention, for Stiegler (2013: 85) explains that `primary retention is a primary
selection, and the criteria for this selection are furnished by secondary retention' (emphasis in
original). In other words, the replacement of `collective imaginaries and individual stories'
(Stiegler, 2011: 58) with the forms of homogenized memory we find on the commercial internet or
broadcast media, impacts not only the constitution of our individual memory, but also, in turn, our
process of perception and selection; it patterns what we choose to pay attention to ­ what we care
for and what we care about. As Stiegler (2013: 87) suggests, `attention is conditioned by these
retentional systems' (emphasis in original).
The expanded influence of industrialized tertiary retentions has profound implications, Stiegler
argues, for our ability to constitute a sense of self, but also for our capacity to envision a collective
future. Stiegler makes frequent use of Gilbert Simondon's concept of `individuation'in his attempts
to describe the correlated process of individual and group becoming ­ what Simondon refers to as
`psychic' and `collective' individuation. For both Stiegler and Simondon, individuals constitutes
themselves in relation to a group through the inheritance of a pre-individual reality or history. In
Stiegler's terms:
The I, as psychic individual, cannot be thought except to the extent that it belongs to a we, which is a
collective individual: the I constitutes itself through the adoption of a collective history, which it inherits
and with which a plurality of Is identify. (Stiegler, 2014: 50, emphases in original)
Individuation is, therefore, a rather complex dynamic of subject formation in which the individual, in
the process of self-constitution, draws from a collective reservoir of memory and potential. Stiegler
translator Johann Rossouw (2011: 53) encapsulates this process neatly when he writes that:
The pre-individual fund is that collective of knowledge, experience, and tradition that a group has
accumulated over time, and it has to be continually reactivated through its simultaneous transmission from
one generation to another ... and through the singular way in which each receiver of the fund adopts it.
Tertiary retentions are crucial for Stiegler because it is these exteriorized memory systems that
provide access to the reservoir of collective experience upon which individuation depends. He
explains, `Tertiary retentions ... undergird every collective and psychic individuation's access to
pre-individual funds'(Stiegler, 2011: 57). As tertiary retentions become increasingly industrialized
(and shared collective memory becomes commercialized and homogeneous), the very process of
individuation falls under threat. The break-down of the process of individuation, cutting off the
pre-individual fund, leads to an inability to constitute the self, but it also threatens the ability to
imagine a collective future. As Stiegler (2009b: 53) suggests, `technicity, being constitutive and, in
particular, constituting the condition of access to the past as preindividuality is what opens up tem-
porality as such, the capacity for projecting the future.' Or as Hansen (2015: 208) elaborates:
For Stiegler, there can be no viable future because this industrially manufactured source has literally taken
the place of `natural' or `lived' secondary memories, and thus of collective cultural traditions that could
furnish a living source for the invention of viable futures.
McKim 291
Stiegler's media theory represents a non-phenomenological or post-phenomenological turn in
the sense that he believes we are increasingly estranged from the repository of memory images and
objects available for us to draw from in order to constitute our sense of self. This claim may at first
appear paradoxical within a contemporary digital media age in which we are encouraged to actively
and persistently contribute to the development of this reservoir of cultural memory (by document-
ing, uploading and re-circulating our experiences and the experience of others), yet the protocols,
conventions and prompts provided by these networks are not of our own making. Stiegler's (2014:
3) claim is that a process of `aesthetic conditioning ... has replaced aesthetic experience'(emphasis
in original), we circulate and reproduce symbols and memories, that are in fundamental ways not
our own ­ we adopt aesthetic formats and content expectations encouraged by the platforms them-
selves and we relinquish ownership of the content we do produce, offering it up for the purpose of
user profiling and algorithmic analysis. It is also worth bearing in mind the challenges raised to the
common claim that digital media in the Web 2.0 era has fostered new forms of participatory culture
and transformed consumers into producers. Lev Manovich (2009: 320), for example, reveals that
according to 2007 statistics, `only between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent of users of the most popular
social media sites (Flickr, YouTube, Wikipedia) contributed their own content.'And Henry Jenkins
et al. (2013: 15) note that our contemporary digital media platforms, such as YouTube, facilitate
`user-circulated content' far more than they encourage `user-generated content'. We might there-
fore claim that the online fund of memory is becoming increasingly homogenized through both the
conditioning or standardization of user-generated material and the perpetual re-circulation of a
relatively small (and increasingly commercial, rather than amateur) pool of available content.
In his recent book Feed-Forward: On the Future of Twenty-First-Century Media (2015), Mark
Hansen makes an even more explicit connection between our increasingly post-experiential digital
media and the resultant foreclosure of the future. Here, Hansen considers the shift towards the
atmospheric and encompassing media environments produced by computational networks, data-
mining technologies and embedded micro-sensors. Hansen claims to distinguish himself from
Stiegler by suggesting that, rather than recording and playing back past human experiences, 21st-
century media now involve the storage of bits of data that `register molecular increments of behav-
ior' (p. 40) oriented towards anticipating and patterning future activity. Hansen's concern is the
expanding number of data-harvesting media technologies, from social media platforms to wearable
bio-tech, that allow for the accumulation of aggregated information on a demographic scale, rather
than personal or durational lived experiences.Amouse click is captured online, a biometric reading
is registered on a smart watch, a geolocation is imprinted through a mobile phone, and the aggrega-
tion and classification of all these data points are used to identify a previously unperceived ten-
dency. The situation Hansen delineates is post-experiential in the sense that we have no direct
access to the digital processes of data analysis and pattern recognition involved. He explains:
The digital computer ... interrupts the circuits linking media and experience ... computational processes
occur at time frames well below the thresholds constitutive of human perceptual experience, they seem
to introduce levels of operationality that impact our experience without yielding any perceptual correlate.
(p. 4)
Many of the operations undertaken by digital technologies, in other words, take place autono-
mously (algorithmically, or machine to machine) with no direct human involvement or act of
perception.
Not unlike Stiegler, Hansen is concerned with the ways in which contemporary digital media
networks produce a kind of conditioning field for human experience, one that has pre-determining
effects on cognition and behaviour. These increasingly enveloping digital media environments are
292 animation: an interdisciplinary journal 12(3)
described variously by Hansen as a `sensory confound' (p. 69), an `atmospheric' media system' (p.
132) and a `peripheral `calculative ambience' (p. 186). But while Stiegler emphasizes the condi-
tioning effects of industrialized tertiary retentions, Hansen outlines an even more intimate intru-
sion into processes of self-actualization and individuation. He writes:
It is precisely because today's data and culture industries can bypass consciousness and go directly to
behavioral, biometric, and environmental data that they are increasingly able to capture our `attention'
without any awareness on our part: precisely because it places conscious deliberation and response out of
play, microtemporal behavioral data that evades the oversight of consciousness allows today's data and
culture industries to accomplish their goal of tightening the circuit between solicitation and response. (p. 58)
Through the accumulation and analysis of micro-behaviours, 21st-century media acquire knowl-
edge about us and our world that is beyond, or rather prior to, our own sensory and conscious
awareness. And it is the operationalizing of this knowledge, by the large data companies who pos-
sess it, that threatens to instrumentally shape or modulate future experience. It must be said that
Stiegler's current writings have actually brought him into much closer alignment with the depic-
tion of computational 21st-century media presented by Hansen in Feed-Forward. For example,
notions of algorithmic governance, automation and data profiling are central to the political analy-
sis of Stiegler's recent Automatic Society, Vol. 1: The Future of Work (2016), complicating Hansen's
claim that the philosopher is primarily concerned with durational or experiential media.
Hansen's response to this data-empowered colonization of future experience is ultimately not to
reject the digital technologies that enable its occurrence. Inspired by the philosophy of Alfred
North Whitehead, he sees in 21st-century media the possibility of an expanded form of `word sen-
sibility', one that compels us to rethink the human as an inseparable part of a much larger environ-
ment. The forms of non-perceptual experience made available by contemporary digital media hold
a surplus of potential and openness that is far from exhausted by the instrumental uses of the con-
temporary data and culture industries. The crucial question for Hansen (2015) is how we might
gain access to and control over this micro-temporal domain of experience. He thus maintains:
We must ... embrace the technically accessible precognitive dimension of sensibility as the very ground
on which to politicize media, to modulate our own becoming by intervening in how media shape sensibility,
and to grasp the techno-sensible complexity involved in ... shaping our own future experience. (p. 133)
The task of re-establishing the open-endedness of the future is, for Hansen, dependent on our abil-
ity to redirect the surplus potential of this new non- or pre-sensory data sphere. Representational
media oriented directly towards the human senses and lived experience appear increasingly irrel-
evant, obsolete or ineffectual within Hansen's depiction. Forms of media operating within the
present time frame of human perception are, for him, already too late to meaningfully affect the
future.
The continued relevance of animation
The relationships between digital media, collective memory and futurity articulated by Stiegler and
Hansen are extremely relevant for considerations of contemporary urbanism and architecture, yet
I think we should hesitate to accept too quickly their tendency to dismiss representational media
(animation included) as either entirely industrialized or increasingly irrelevant due to the domi-
nance of non-perceptual forms of computation.2 It is certainly becoming clear that the built envi-
ronment, despite its fundamental materiality, is a space that is far from immune from the effects of
McKim 293
the media changes described by the two philosophers. In fact, the ways in which urban develop-
ment has been absorbed into global networks of digital computation is largely illustrative of the
processes outlined in their thought. For one, physical urban space has become so permeated by
micro-sensors, smart grids and ubiquitous computing that the city itself can now be viewed as an
extended data gathering system. Urban theorists such as Benjamin Bratton and Jennifer Gabrys
have gone so far as to consider the city as one node within a larger structure of `planetary scale
computation'(see Bratton's The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty, 2015, and Gabrys's Program
Earth: Environmental Sensing Technology and the Making of a Computational Planet, 2016). Who
controls the data generated by cities and how effectively inhabitants are able to access the informa-
tion they are collectively producing in order to influence urban decision making remain central
issues within current discussions of `data citizenship'and `algorithmic governance'(see, for exam-
ple, Leszczynski, 2016, and Graham, 2005).
The ability of urban communities to draw from their reservoirs of collective memory in order to
formulate an effective vision of the future has also been significantly disrupted by the current struc-
tures of investment and real estate financing. The capacity to intervene in the production of urban
space has appeared increasingly cut off to the general population as long-term development plans
dictate city transformation well into the future. This process of constructing urban infrastructure or
settlement for projective political or economic aims, rather than for the actual demands of an exist-
ing population, has been labelled `speculative urbanism' or `speculative urbanization' by urban
scholars and planners such as Christopher Marcinkoski and Michael Goldman. Marcinkoski (2015:
16) highlights the ways that `new financial tools ­ increasingly complex transactional instruments'
allow local real estate to be transformed into an investable global commodity. The continued exist-
ence of urban communities thus becomes increasingly subject to the algorithmic calculations and
automated risk assessments of global financial markets. Without access to this financial data and
these analytical tools, city inhabitants often find themselves attempting to influence urban deci-
sions that have long since been determined. Hansen's notion of a future horizon pre-established by
the accumulation and processing of unavailable data takes on a very real form in the example of
speculative urbanism, as does Stiegler's image of individuals alienated from their own resources of
cultural memory. As Goldman (2011: 557) describes in reference to projective urbanism in the
developing world, `the anxieties of high-rolling speculation not only affect people's ability to hold
onto their living spaces, but also their jobs, identities and communities.'Stiegler (2013: 82) himself
acknowledges the damaging impact of technologically-enabled forms of speculation when he
warns, `speculators are typically people who pay little attention to the objects of their speculation
­ and who, moreover, take little care of them.'
Yet, despite the growing impact of data-oriented forms of urban computation, representational
media (and animation, in particular) continue to play a significant role in the future development
of our cities. In fact, the ways in which data-driven speculation and digital representations of pro-
posed projects work in conjunction to shape urban futures warrants considerably more critical
attention. The use of animated digital renderings within the marketing of speculative developments
presents an architectural version of the CGI-fuelled `cinemas of transactions' described by Leon
Gurevitch (2010: 369), in which spectacular computer graphics become a value-generating cur-
rency independent of their specific representation content. As Degen et al. (2017: 2) reveal in their
study of the role of digital visualization within a large-scale redevelopment project in Doha, Qatar,
`computer-generated images (CGIs) have now become the most common type of image media
used to visualise and market future urban redevelopment' (emphasis in original). The production
and circulation of increasingly sophisticated renderings of proposed developments is the final step
in the temporal loop of urban speculation ­ financial opportunities are identified through market
calculations, sections of the city are earmarked for investment and demographic change, then
294 animation: an interdisciplinary journal 12(3)
photo-realistic representations of these developments are produced that signal the apparent inevi-
tability of this process before it has even begun. The expanding gap between the visualizations
produced by developers and the needs of local communities is highlighted by designer Tobias
Revell's (2016) claim that, `very few renders evoke hope and aspiration at street level because they
are harbingers of someone else's ideal of your built future.' Promotional renderings also often
attempt to suture development projects to the cultural memory of their locations. Take, for exam-
ple, the hybrid animation marketing The Stage, Shoreditch EC2, a luxury housing complex in East
London. The video, involving a combination of live acting, real locations, animated characters and
architectural renderings, presents the development (where one-bedroom flats start at £800,000) as
a natural addition to the creative vibrancy of the area and as a cultural custodian of the remains of
Shakespeare's Curtain Theatre, on which the complex is built. The widespread circulation and
particular aesthetic of these animated promotional videos have produced forms of parody and
resistance by artists such as Hito Steyerl, in her 2013 work How Not to be Seen. A Fucking Didactic
Educational .MOV File, and Lawrence Lek, in his Unreal Estate (the Royal Academy is Yours), a
2015 `speculative simulation' (to use the artist's own term).
The way in which computational data and animated renderings interact within the processes of
urban speculation is more typical of our current media landscape than perhaps Stiegler and Hansen
would care to concede. Rather than claim that representational or sensory media is becoming less
relevant in a computational age, perhaps we should acknowledge instead that our contemporary
media is increasingly constituted by mediations of media itself. Or, in other words, there is an
increasingly preponderance of media that translates digital information into a humanly perceptible
form. Seen from this perspective, the relevance of digital animation, comprised of everything from
data visualizations to computer generated images, has actually expanded in our post-phenomeno-
logical or post-experiential computational environments. While Hansen is quite right to alert us to
the growth of machine to machine communications and the computational harnessing of pre-cog-
nitive affects and tendencies, animation may still remain as a kind of representational last stand and
a viable form of resistance in relation to dehumanizing forms of digital calculation. It is perhaps
not surprising then that so many contemporary architects and artists concerned with urban and geo-
political topics are turning to digital animation as a tool for both representation and intervention.
Animation, for these artists and designers, presents the possibility of reengaging with temporal
frames outside the limited context of the present and restoring some of the lost potentiality of both
the past and the future. In the remaining section of this article, I will briefly highlight four examples
of artists and architects using digital animation as a means of contending with the temporal and
political complexities of the urban. The first two, Stan Douglas and Forensic Architecture, are
oriented towards the past and cultural memory, while the latter two, Larissa Sansour and Liam
Young, are oriented towards the future.
Digital animation as urban and temporal intervention
Canadian conceptual artist Stan Douglas is not generally associated with digital animation or com-
puter generated imaging (being more frequently recognized for his film, video and photography
work), but his recent adoption of these technologies is indicative of their expanded use within criti-
cal art practice. In a constellation of related works set in his native Vancouver, Douglas has made
use of computer generated images to explore a relatively unacknowledged period of the city's his-
tory. Digitally rendered images of 1940s Vancouver appear as backdrops within the 2014 stage
play Helen Lawrence; as standalone printed works, such as The Second Hotel Vancouver (2014)
and Bumtown (2015) (see Figure 1); and in animated form in the interactive installation and app
Circa 1948, produced in collaboration with the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) Digital
McKim 295
Studio in 2014. The primary locations recreated by Douglas are the Hotel Vancouver (the second
of three incarnations of the hotel, this iteration constructed in the Italianate revival style by the
Canadian Pacific Railway in 1916) and Hogan's Alley, the unofficial name of Park Lane, a ram-
shackle alley running through the neighbourhood of Strathcona. The Hotel Vancouver recreated by
Douglas is a once grand, but now crumbling, railway hotel; having closed at the end of the great
depression in 1939, the hotel had been taken over by homeless WWII veterans in the immediate
post-war period before eventually being razed in 1949 (see Figure 2). The now demolished Hogan's
Alley area, located near the city's train stations, was an ethnically mixed neighbourhood and a
post-war red-light district known for its illegal drinking and music establishments, brothels and

gambling dens. It is described within the Circa 1948 app as a place where `immigrant workers,
drifters, and dreamers rub elbows with politicians and cops on the take'.
Douglas's digital reconstructions visualize a forgotten moment of Vancouver's somewhat
seamy past that stands in sharp contrast to the city's current image as an affluent Western metrop-
olis of gleaming condo towers. The 1940s are significant for Douglas in that they represent an
uncertain and less often recalled interim period between the war era and `the sudden call to order
and morality' of the 1950s (Farago, 2014). The process of regenerating this past moment (the
physical history of which has largely been erased from the urban environment) involves the
animation of visual and written archival materials. The digital prints Douglas has produced of
these locations are remarkably detailed and it is actually their slightly uncanny hyper-realism
that gives away their status as renders. They are constructed through the digitization and selec-
tive overlay of multiple historical photographs. Curator and gallery director Fiona Bradley
(2014: 13) describes the complex reconstruction process involving the use of `a computer pro-
gramme to apply photographic images (textures) to three-dimensional geometry (meshes)'. The
Circa 1948 app, employing a first-person point of view common to video games, allows users to
navigate through the two locations, eavesdropping on conversations that form a disjointed nar-
rative of political corruption and shady development plans.3 As Douglas suggests, `We get a
sense of the various real estate scams that are going on in this post-war period, and a lot about
the reorganization of urban space ' (Glassman, 2016). In 1948, Hogan's Alley and its surround-
ing streets constituted one of the most diverse areas of the city and home to the largest black
community in Vancouver at the time. This area of Strathcona has a long history of resisting the
threat of demolition that came with each urban renewal project, Hogan's Alley itself being even-

Douglas uses digital animation and rendering techniques to recover an otherwise lost period of
Vancouver's urban past, one that significantly disrupts the commonly promoted historical narrative
and trajectory of the city. Revisiting this period of post-war transition is particularly relevant at a
moment when the city is considered to have reached a point of crisis due to real estate speculation,
processes of gentrification and soaring housing prices (Kassam, 2016). Douglas's re-animation of
a past moment of urban uncertainty and political unrest expands the available reservoir of cultural
memory associated with the city. Digital animation is, in this case, a tool for resisting, rather than
promoting, the unquestioned acceptance of a version of urban progress fuelled by unfettered real
estate markets and non-transparent municipal development projects. Employing Stiegler's termi-
nology, we might say that Douglas re-establishes a connection with Vancouver's complicated past
in a manner that enables different processes of collective individuation and thus makes possible
new responses to the present moment of urban crisis. And indeed, Douglas's artwork has formed
part of the recently reconstituted memory of largely forgotten elements of the city's history, includ-
ing Hogan's Alley (Badelt, 2014).
The members of the ForensicArchitecture research agency, established in 2011 at Goldsmiths's
Centre for Research Architecture and led by Eyal Weizman, have been developing new methods
of spatial analysis and visualization with very explicit political applications. Weizman (2014: 9)
describes the group's mandate in terms of an attempt `to bring new material and aesthetic sensi-
bilities to bear upon the legal and political implications of state violence, armed conflict, and
climate change'. The projects completed by the collective of designers, architects and lawyers
that make up Forensic Architecture are varied and are often undertaken in collaboration with
NGOs, international institutions and political organizations, such as the UN, Human Rights
Watch and Amnesty International. While developing new approaches to the collection of evi-
dence in relation to human rights violations and state crimes (with the material `testimony' of
McKim 297
architecture placed at the centre of that forensic investigation), the agency is also producing
innovative ways of representing that evidence involving a variety of advanced imaging tech-
nologies, including 3D animation.
The agency's investigations have included the use of 3D laser scanning and Ground Penetrating
Radar (GPR) to gather evidence of two former concentration camps (Staro Sajmiste and Omarska)
in operation during the Yugoslav war; visualizations of the effects of white phosphorus munitions
used during the December 2008 to January 2009 Israeli attacks on Gaza; and the use of computer
modelling (based on the testimony of a surviving witness) to digitally reconstruct a home in Mir
Ali, Pakistan, destroyed in 2010 during a US drone strike that killed five people (see Figure 3). One
of the most recent Forensic Architecture investigations makes particularly pronounced use of ani-
mation techniques in its presentation of evidence. The Rafah: Black Friday investigation, under-
taken in collaboration with Amnesty International, documents the war operations that took place
between 1 and 4 August 2014 in the city of Rafah in Gaza. These four days would become one of
the deadliest episodes of the war after the Israeli army, in response to the capture of an Israeli sol-
dier by Hamas fighters, appear to have implemented `the Hannibal Directive', a controversial mili-
tary command described by Amnesty International as one `designed to deal with captures of
soldiers by unleashing massive firepower on persons, vehicles and buildings in the vicinity of the
attack, despite the risk to civilians and the captured soldier(s)' (Amnesty International, 2015).
Although banned from travelling to Gaza, the Forensic Architecture investigation reconstructed
the events of those four days through the analysis of hundreds of images and videos, taken by wit-
nesses, professional and citizen-journalists, made available largely through social media platforms.
Using a complex array of techniques, including geo-synching, image compositing, metadata analy-
sis and correction, visual smoke plume and shadow studies and remote sensing analysis from satel-
lite images, the Forensic Architecture group were able to piece together a detailed account of the
extent of the bombing and damage occurring in four days of attacks that resulted in between 135
and 200 civilian deaths. These various elements of visual evidence are integrated into a computer
generated 3D model of the city, indicating their relative location and time of occurrence. This com-
plicated process of spatial and temporal mapping is made intelligible to viewers through the pro-
duction of a sophisticated digital animation that visualizes these investigative steps, bringing
together a multiplicity of data types (see Figure 4). The objective of the project is to provide

evidence of the disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks of the Israeli forces and to urge an
independent investigation into clear violations of international humanitarian law.
In the work of the Forensic Architecture group, digital animation becomes a crucial method of
visualizing the conflicts and violence of the recent past in a manner that makes these images opera-
tional within specific forums for political and legal action, such as international human rights tri-
bunals. The group's methods of data collection and analysis seem to be an important example of
the expanded world sensibility identified by Hansen, this time directed towards a progressive goal.
Here the repository of micro-temporalities and affects accumulated within social media become
potentialized towards an end that could never have been predicted by the owners of these plat-
forms. Weizman (2014: 12) describes how `new visibilities have emerged with the development
and widespread accessibility of digital data derived from activist imagery and their accelerated
dissemination via mobile phone, cloud, and social networks.' The work of the group is an impor-
tant reminder of the political possibilities of these technologies outside the context of their Western
commercial origins. Weizman is acutely aware of the change in sensory awareness represented by
the `forensic sensibility' his research agency advocates and speaks of this shift in ways that are
quite synchronized with Hansen's own terminology. He describes bypassing `human testimony'(p.
10) and the sometimes fallible narration of lived experience and memory in favour of the material
evidence that manifests itself `well below the threshold of unenhanced visual perception' (p. 14).
In this forensic context, architecture operates like a sensor, according to Weizman, recording oth-
erwise undetectable events and occurrences. But Weizman is also attuned to the ways in which
these forms of technology enhanced imaging, combined with the accumulation of digital data cir-
culating through social networks require new techniques of representation and mediation in order
to be legible within specific political and legal contexts. He writes, `these images also call for new
practices of trawling through, looking at, and looking again, interpreting, verifying, decoding and
amplifying messages and broadcasting them further' (p. 12). Expanded modes of sensory aware-
ness and information processing must also be translated into perceptible and actionable forms, and
digital animation is an important vehicle for this translation.

The work of Palestinian artist Larissa Sansour concerns a similar geographic and political terri-
tory, but employs a considerably different aesthetic approach. Making use of digital animation
techniques and the genre of science fiction, both of which are more commonly associated with
Western popular culture, Sansour envisions future scenarios in which the current political condi-
tions of the Palestinian people are taken to their dystopian logical conclusions. In her 2012 work
entitled Nation Estate, Sansour combines computer generated images with live acting (the artist
herself taking the central role), to depict an architectural resolution to the deadlock of the Israeli/
Palestinian peace process. The film introduces the viewer to a high-rise complex in which the
entire nation of Palestine is now housed, each floor containing the remains of a former city
(Jerusalem on floor 13, Ramallah on 14 ...). In a conversation with the curator Nat Muller (2016),
Sansour explains the irony of the scenario ­ the Palestinians are comfortable in the self-contained
structure (there are no check points here), yet they are imprisoned. The protagonist exits the lift at
the Bethlehem floor and proceeds to her living quarters, where she tends to an olive tree growing
out of the pristine white floor of the apartment and looks out over the security wall that separates
the building from the surrounding landscape (see Figure 5). The short film turns the aesthetic
tropes of the glossy render-based animations promoting global real estate developments towards an
even more disturbing speculative scenario.
In her 2015 film In the Future They Ate from the Finest Porcelain, Sansour and her co-creator
Søren Lind introduce another temporally complex scenario, again employing live motion and com-
puter generated images. In the film's sci-fi storyline, a resistance group deposits elaborate china in
a desert landscape in anticipation of it eventually being unearthed, thereby proving the existence of
an ancient civilization and supporting the group's future claims to the territory (see Figure 6). This
action is referred to in the film as `narrative terrorism', the establishment of a fictional founding
myth that has immediate implications for nationhood and land rights. The film's narrator suggests
the political nature of excavated history, stating, `In its most perverted form, archaeology galvanizes
public sentiment, confirms myths of the past and defends them against scrutiny.' The allegorical
reference is not difficult to detect, the struggle for control of heritage sites within the ever shrinking
occupied Palestinian territories has turned archaeology into a weapon of politics within the Middle
East, with UNESCO sometimes placed in the position of reluctant arbiter (Gilbert, 2013). While the
Forensic Architecture group produces alternative forms of material evidence, Sansour uses specula-
tive fiction as another means to complicate state-sponsored historical narratives. Digital animation

allows the artist to engage in an indirect, yet provocative investigation of the current politics of the
region and thus to re-open the question of the future of Palestine.
The final example I wish to highlight, the self-described `speculative architect' Liam Young,
also draws frequently from science fiction tropes and aesthetics in his future-oriented design prac-
tice. Through his numerous creative projects, Young attempts to restore the forward thinking and
experimental vision once embodied within the discipline by figures such as Cedric Price and the
members of Archigram. In a `think tank' conversation connected with his 2012 Under Tomorrows
Sky project, he explains:
It's the impulse to imagine and speculate that those failed futures had at their core which is exciting, which
is what we're trying to revitalize and trying to look back on. Because no one's done it with the same kind
of force as they did for a while. No one's launched a future vision with such traction, that's really captured
the popular imagination. (Young, 2012)
Young therefore takes on the task of wrestling considerations of the future back from the narrow
range of social actors and organizations that have delimited this field of vision. In doing so, he
often makes use of advanced imaging technologies typically restricted to such large-scale opera-
tions as military departments or resource extraction industries ­ a visual strategy that is in many
ways shared with Forensic Architecture, but is applied to quite different ends in Young's work.
Amongst his recently completed projects are a film shot entirely with 3D laser scanners, entitled
Where the City Can't See (a sci-fi narrative set in the Chinese-owned Detroit Economic Zone) and
another, entitled In the Robot Skies, shot with autonomous pre-programmed drones.
Animation is again a frequently used visual resource for Young's speculative projects. The pre-
viously mentioned Under Tomorrows Sky project brought together a varied group of thinkers,
including the sci-fi writer Bruce Sterling, the graphic novelist Warren Ellis and the scientist Rachel
Armstrong, to discuss the possible technological and biological development of a fictional future
city. A room-sized movie miniature model of the city was established in Eindhoven, a platform for
materializing some of the ideas proposed through the think tank. Animators and illustrators were
commissioned to visualize specific regions or sectors of the city. In his description of the project,
Young emphasizes the non-dystopian perspective of the initiative, suggesting that in the current
moment establishing a hopeful vision of the urban future is a much more unusual and challenging

task. He promises, `Under Tomorrows Sky imagines a post-capitalist urbanity full of optimism and
joy, full of life and aspiration.'
In other completed animated works, Young is not always so reluctant to employ a dystopian
register. In his `New City' series of digitally animated skylines, the architect presents exaggerated
versions of current technological and urban tendencies that are difficult to characterize as aspira-
tional. Keeping Up Appearance (2014), for example, presents a homogeneous cityscape of high
rises, in which Samsung holds a complete technological monopoly (from smart phones to air con-
ditioners to city signage). Edgelands (2014) depicts a kind of data shantytown on the outskirts of a
city centre in which scraps of personal information are salvaged for any remaining value (see
Figure 7). These animated snippets of a possible urbanism to come are one part thought experiment
and one part critical warning. An oscillation between fascination and dismay in relation to our
potential urban future is common within Young's work. It surfaces as well within his Unknown
Fields Division project, a design research studio involving expeditions to remote locations that
Young leads in conjunction with artist and architect Kate Davies. In their `Tales from the Dark Side
of the City' exhibition mounted at the Architecture Association in the winter of 2016­2017, the
studio explores the multiple, often unseen geographies that resource our contemporary urban and
media ecologies. The group documents the Bolivian salt flats of Salar De Uyuni where lithium is
extracted for use in battery production, the Alaskan outposts where environmental scientists pro-
duce data for climate simulations and the black market mining towns of Madagascar that supply
precious gems for the various products of luxury brands. Animation is used as a tool for both
speculative exploration and information delivery within the exhibition. Animated and poetic
`dramatizations' of climate change data are presented, for example, as an alternative to ineffective
traditional forms of information visualization. Logistical data pertaining to the various resource
extraction sites explored by the studio are overlaid onto film footage of the workers involved in
these often dangerous and unregulated industries, a technique that simultaneously presents the
singular experience of individual participants and the statistical impact of their combined activi-
ties. Young's most recent animated works include Renderlands (2017), a love story between an
Indian render farm worker and his digital model, taking place in the `scavenged VFX movie mod-
els and 3D game assets that remain on studio hard drives ­ the remnants of cancelled production
jobs` (Young, 2017)4 (see Figure 8), and Tomorrow's Storeys (2017), a visualization of a near future
Athens, inspired by a public think tank of science fiction authors, visual artists, photographers and
architects (and thus bringing him full circle back to the critical fiction methodologies of the Under
Tomorrows Sky project) (see Figure 9).

The use of digital animation by Young in these and other projects can again be viewed as a man-
ner of answering Hansen's call for an expanded form of world sensibility. The visualization prac-
tices that Young employs are a means of integrating the complex geo-political and economic
information underpinning our contemporary technical and urban environments in ways that make
this accumulated data capable of being processed by the viewer. The forms of animated speculation
that Young develops both illuminate elements of our contemporary media ecologies to which we
are largely unaware and encourage us to reengage in the activity of imagining the future develop-
ment of our urban condition.
This article has attempted to highlight the ways that architects and artists are employing digital
animation to move beyond the temporal constraints of the present and productively engage with
urban pasts and futures. The media philosophies developed by Stiegler and Hansen provide an
important framework for considering the non-experiential nature of contemporary digital media
and the implications this has for our ability to access shared cultural memory and envision possible

collective futures. While drawing insights from both of these thinkers, I have also tried to counter-
act what I see as a tendency in their work to downplay the continued relevance of representational
or experiential media forms in the current digital age. With its continued expansion into new
domains of life and politics, and the privileged role it plays in the visualization of computational
data, the contemporary importance of digital animation is arguably growing rather than diminish-
ing. This certainly appears to be true in relation to media engagements with urban politics, as I
hope is made clear by the four examples of art and architectural practice highlighted in this article.
While Stan Douglas and Forensic Architecture utilize digital animation to examine past atrocities
and restore forgotten elements of urban history, Larissa Sansour and Liam Young employ similar
visual technologies to recover the speculative dimension of the future from the current monopolies
of access. All these artists and architects resist the inaccessibility of the digital encouraged by
industrialized contemporary technologies and platforms, attempting instead to realize the potential
of these media forms to help overcome our current temporal constraints.

Notes
1. We were fortunate to have Liam Young and two members of the Forensic Architecture agency, Eyal
Weizman and Susan Schuppli, as participants of the `Life Remade: Politics of Animation' symposium
held at Birkbeck in 2015.
2. I recognize that I am somewhat overstating, for argument's sake, Stiegler and Hansen's dismissal of the
progressive potential of representational or experiential media. Stiegler, for example, claims in the first
volume of Symbolic Misery (2014: 83) that cinema is `par excellence the aesthetic experience able to
fight aesthetic conditioning on its own terrain'. But he also presents cinema as something of a dying art,
being gradually killed off by a `generalized tele-visual system' against which `the last filmmakers are
struggling' (p. 86).
3. The project was designed by NFB Digital Studio Executive Producer Loc Dao using Maya software and
a custom open-source Canadian 3D render engine called Kraken (Glassman, 2016).
4. According to Young (2017), he used actual `digital detritus' from the film and game industries in order
to construct his fictional render landscape.
