For more than 40 years in France, road safety engineering
methods put the drivers' behaviors aside. The reactive
approach illustrated this engineering way (Galland, 1991).
This approach consisted of delimiting zones of accidents
through statistical studies from police reports. Every zone of
accidents was indicative of an infrastructural geometrical
problem. In this way, engineers had to detect the local cause
of accidents and resolve the problem by a specific road con-
struction (Galland, 1991). While the reactive approach has
significantly reduced the number of accidents during 1970-
1990s, since the year 2000, the engineering methods of the
Ministry of Transport have begun to change.
Indeed, after a gradual decline in accidents since 1990, the
death toll of people killed in 6 days rose to 8,437 killed in
1998 when compared with 7,989 in 1997 (Road Safety
National Interministerial Observatory [RSNIO], 2007). Faced
with this rise, the road safety has become an important stake
particularly held by Jacques Chirac who was seeking a sec-
ond presidential mandate during the presidential election in
2002. After being the "great national cause" of his last term,
road safety has been declared, after his re-election, the "vast
presidential political endeavor" during the French National
Day.This change of political semantic is not neutral (Devillard
& Marchetti, 2008). From that moment, road safety field has
become a showcase space, a barometer of the State action.
At the same time, the Ministry of Transport was confronted
with structural stakes. Environmental problems linked to the
land-use planning policy and the decentralization of the State
competences since 30 years in spatial planning project and
transports have radically transformed the relation between
users and State services. Embodied by the Barnier law (Law
related to the strengthening of the environment protection,
1995) and the Democracy of proximity law (Law related to
the Democracy of proximity, 2002), citizens and associations
are granted a hitherto unseen right to examine. This transfor-
mation of the users'role leads to the transparency of the State
action and to possibilities of judicial sanctions against the
Ministry (Worms, 1985).
Consequently, the French Ministry of Transport has
undertaken a reorganization of its services. Until then, the
road safety control was ensured by local services called
Departmental Cell of Exploitation and Security (DCES).
DCES provided a road safety expertise for local services of
road construction and also realized the assessment of these
infrastructures. In a "judicialisation" context,1 the DCES
judge and be judged position posed problem. Thus, the con-
trol ensured by DCES has been replaced by the Road Safety
Audit2 (RSA) in 2001 and completely suppressed in 2007. To
guarantee the independence of RSA from local services,
which realizes the project manager's functions, RSA has

Is Driving an Expertise as the Others?
A Study of Boundary-Work Around the
Legitimacy of Knowledge
Geoffrey Carrère1
Abstract
Since the year 2000, the French Ministry of Transport has incorporated a new instrument called the road safety audit (RSA).
The audit proposed a singular method, which consists of assessing infrastructures on the basis of drivers' experiences to
get around the limitations of technical knowledge for decreasing the number of accidents. Through an ethnographic study,
this article aims to analyze the legitimacy assigned to social and technical knowledge in the auditors' work. I will study the
legitimacy issue through the cognitive change initiated by the audit and the political stakes confronting the Ministry which
ascribe, for their part, a central place to technical knowledge. In this way, I will analyze the auditors' boundary-work around
the legitimacy accorded to driving and technical expertise in different moments of RSA assessment.

been put under the administrative supervision of the General
Directorate for Transports and Infrastructures (DGTI) of the
central Ministry. In this way, the protection of the Ministry
services against judicial pleas has induced an administrative
reorganization, which granted a significant place to central
services of the State in the road safety control.
The RSA implementation also gave the opportunity to
bring in a new method named the proactive approach. The
proactive approach considers that the application of techni-
cal norms is not sufficient to guarantee by itself the users'
safety. To go beyond these limits, the proactive approach
proposes an inductive assessment of the road. It consists of
driving on the infrastructure for picking up failing elements
on the basis of the auditor drivers' feelings. As outlined by
the designers of RSA, this instrument aims to depart from
technical tropism by giving a place to drivers' experiential
knowledge:
Road Safety Audit . . . is not intended to be technical check on
the design elements nor a design standards check . . . Although
Road Safety Audit does look at scheme design from the road
users' point of view, it is not in fact a road user audit--which
aims to ensure that each road user has been adequately catered
for within a scheme. (Belcher, Proctor, & Cook, 2008, pp. 1-2)
Hence, after an experimentation period, RSA had been
officially incorporated in 2001 by a circular (Circular related
to the implementation of a road project security control,
2001). But, during the experimentation, the auditors realized
the road safety control on the basis of their driving expertise.
The Ministry integrated a compulsory new technical tool
called analysis grids3: These instruments propose to techni-
cally frame the use of drivers' experiential knowledge. Used
during the assessment of the road, the grids are composed of
several questions considered as the main drivers' interroga-
tions in a driving situation. These drivers' interrogations
referred to technical answers from engineering books such as
Technical Conditions for Planning Inter-Cities Highways or
instructions about Main Roads Planning. Considered by the
auditors as a technical check, which digresses from the
inductive approach of RSA, auditors are confronted with a
contradictory injunction. They have to realize the road safety
control between two different kinds of knowledge: the driv-
ers' experiential knowledge suggested by the proactive
approach and the technical knowledge from the analysis
grids imposed by the Ministry.
How auditors proceed to a road safety control between
these two forms of knowledge? Does one prevail over the
other? Do these kinds of knowledge have the same place and
legitimacy in the RSAexpertise? Here, we will put aside issues
about governmentality (Foucault, 2004) through the New
Public Management and neoliberal logics of the audit (Power,
2005; Rose & Miller, 1992). Also, we will not analyze the
question of confidence granted by the audit through the risk
issue (Power, 2005). Based on the case study of auditors from
French Ministry of Transport, this research aims to analyze,
in an ethnographic way, the work done by the auditors
between two contradictory forms of knowledge. This analy-
sis will interrogate the classical opposition between expert
and lay-knowledge described in the sociological literature
and lead us to study the auditors'boundary-work through the
legitimacy issue (Gieryn, 1983).
In the section "Beyond the Symbolic Struggle: When
RSA Revamps the Expert and Lay-Knowledge Relation," we
will see that RSA revamps the expert and lay-knowledge
relation by posing this issue outside the symbolic struggle
dimension. Based on this observation, we develop an origi-
nal methodological approach, which consists of defining
RSA expertise not as a social position but as a process of
acquisition of knowledge (Trépos, 1996). Then, we will pres-
ent the results of our ethnographic study realized in Lot-et-
Garonne4 department. As such, we will see that technical and
driving expertise are mobilized in two different moments of
RSA. We will see that these moments refer to a differentiated
use of the legitimacy assigned to technical knowledge and
drivers' experiences in accordance with the particular stakes
that expertise has to answer. Therefore, we will open a last
discussion about the legitimacy of knowledge through the
problem extension established by Collins and Evans (2007).
Beyond the Symbolic Struggle: When
RSA Revamps the Expert and Lay-
Knowledge Relation
From philosophy (Habermas, 1973) to the Actor-Network
Theory (Barthe, Callon, & Lascoumes, 2001; Callon, 1986)
and the second wave of the sociology of science (Bloor,
1976; Brint, 1994; Collingridge & Reeve, 1986; Jasanoff,
1994, 2005; Jasanoff & Wynne, 1998; Roqueplo, 1997; Roy,
2001; Wynne, 2001), the theoretical literature about the
expert and laypeople relation mainly focuses on the lay-
knowledge difficulty to succeed to the symbolic struggle
against the technical or the scientific expertise.
For its part, RSA seems to be a paradoxical object. On one
hand, by using drivers' experiences, RSA seems to transcend
the symbolic struggle between expert and lay-knowledge.
On the other hand, the technical knowledge and the compul-
sory character of the analysis grid interrogate the possibili-
ties of hybridization process. In the RSA case, drivers'
experiences and technical knowledge both participate in the
assessment but are related to two different rationales for
action. The technical knowledge falls within structural log-
ics. It is a form of knowledge that stems from past engineer-
ing experiences and that has been institutionalized and
formalized in norms. It is internalized as the reference that
has to be applied in a given context. The drivers' experi-
ences, for their part, appear as a form of knowledge that
comes from subjectivation process (Cantelli & Genard,
2007; Dubet, 1994), that is to say, the resources accumulated
Carrère 3
by driving experiences through the singularity of each social
trajectory (Dubet, 1994). In this way, driving experiences
appear as non-formalized knowledge but which can be for-
malized in engineering norms in the future.
Hence, the question posed by RSA is not the issue of the
struggle between technical and drivers' experiential knowl-
edge but the issue of the auditor combinatorial activity
between these technical and driving expertise. In this way,
RSA expertise must be comprehended as the result of exper-
tise acquisition through socialization process (Collins &
Evans, 2002, 2007).
The question of the use of knowledge is directly and
deeply linked to the issue of the legitimacy. Indeed, a
social actor will use a particular form of knowledge
because, this one, consciously or not, appears legitimate
for him in a particular social context. In this way, to ana-
lyze the legitimacy issue between technical and driving
expertise, we decided to use the boundary-work notion
(Gieryn, 1983). Here, we defined the boundary-work as
the notion that focuses on the boundaries lability between
different forms of knowledge according to their social use
and actor interplays (Bérard & Crespin, 2010). Specifically,
this notion tends to highlight the paradoxical process
between the permeation and demarcation of knowledge. It
tends to understand the social determinants that encourage
the social actors to consider a form of knowledge, at any
given moment, legitimate to participate in expertise, and,
at another time, as a non-legitimate.
Because the legitimacy assigned to a form of knowledge
is deeply linked to conscious or unconscious social determi-
nants, the analysis of the boundary-work in RSA has to be
put in perspective not only with the political, historical, and
cultural context but also with the auditors' social trajectories
that structure the RSA expertise.
Case Study: Are Auditors Experts as
the Others
The study of the auditors' social trajectories and the analysis
of the historical, cultural, and political background of the
Ministry have highlighted the specific features of the RSA.
Fruit of the French engineering tradition and holder of a new
form of expertise, the auditors both differ from the classical
expert of the Ministry and fall within the traditional French
engineering epistemic culture (Knorr-Cetina, 1999).
Indeed, as the overwhelming majority of scientists and
technicians in France, auditors are civil servants of the State.
Since the Jacobin period, science and technical domains are
submitted to the administrative supervision of the State
(Hayek, 1980; Jasanoff, 2005; Roggero, 2006). The corps
notion, defined as the means to recruit, manage, and control
people in the administration (Thoenig, 1987) as well as the
State control toward the schooling system are two instru-
ments that participate to the State domination toward science
and techniques.
The auditors arise from this context. Auditors are road
engineers and civil servants of the French State. They have
been educated in engineering schools such as the National
School of Technicians of Equipment or the National School
of Civil Engineering. After graduating, they have moved
toward a civil servant career in the French Ministry of
Transport. There, during the first years, they have been
trained trough a companionship system. Escorted by an
experienced engineer, they have been trained on the applica-
tion of technical knowledge and are reinforced with the idea
of their corps belonging. The case of an auditor from the
Departmental Direction of the Territories (DDT) illustrates
this trajectory:
After obtaining my engineering degree at National School of
Civil Engineering, I entered, in 1981, in the road subdivision of
Gers department. In Gers, I learn the crucial knowledge of the
road project. . . . In 1981, I met a technician from the National
School of Civil Engineering who was head of section and also
my spiritual father. With him, I put my theoretical knowledge to
the test of his practices and I learn a lot. (Auditor from the
Ministry of Transport)
Moreover, the auditors' trajectories denote the acquisition
of a heterogenic technical knowledge. Indeed, auditors have
worked in different services of the Ministry and been initi-
ated into several domains of the road as design, sign boards,
or accident analysis:
My entire career is based on road safety operations. I entered to
the Ministry as a designer. In this stage, I learned my job: guides
and others instructions. I have been lucky to work in
companionship with a road safety technician from the TSCE. He
taught me a lot about the horizontal alignment, what it could be
dangerous about bending and width or not dangerous. Then,
when I entered to infrastructures service, I taught lot of things
about the road alignment. What I could do and what I couldn't
do about bending and gradient. So, here, it was very precise.
There are documents, norms to design a road alignment . . .After
that, I entered in CDES. I obtained the rank of assessor . . . I
work on the equipment domain as a technical adviser. After that,
I work more specifically on the road safety issue. I have been
trained by my colleagues of the accidents service. Then, I was
attracted by the proactive approach so I decided to join the
training to be auditor. (Auditor from the Ministry of Transport)
As we can see at the end of this abstract from an inter-
view, the auditors' trajectories are also characterized by a
specific training. First realized internally and next framed by
a European directive in 2008 (Directive of the European
Parliament and Council about the safety management of road
infrastructures, 2008), the RSA training is recognized by the
certification handed over by the minister. This training
emphasizes on the proactive approach learning. It shows the
necessity of the use of drivers' experiences in an inductive
approach of the road and presents the analysis grids, which
have to be used to complete the driving expertise.
4 SAGE Open
This training lasted two days. First, they presented the audit
method. The audit is above all a road control based on the
drivers' eyes. That's drivers' experiences, sensitivity and
feelings. The auditor is more human than prescriptive. In a
second phase, they showed us tools that we have to use including
the analysis grids. (Auditor from the Ministry of Transport)
Trained in national engineering schools, then by compan-
ionship in several services of the Ministry, and finally edu-
cated through the specific RSA training, the auditors'
trajectories are characterized by the acquisition of an eclectic
knowledge. This eclecticism incites auditors to define their
expertise as generalist. "This is general culture. . . . We have
a large and plural knowledge. We are not specialist of a
domain but we can bring out where the problem is. We assess
a road project on through the prism of several dimensions"
(Auditor from the Ministry of Transport).
But, the word "generalist" also indicates the integration of
a symbolic violence (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1970). Indeed, if
auditors define themselves as experts, the auditors' plural
knowledge is seen on the margins of the institutional defini-
tion of the expertise. The canonic definition of expertise is
presented as follows by an auditor:
And you, what do you think about that? For me, I am an expert.
But here an expert is someone who perfectly knows his field and
who follows the evolutions of his field. To be expert you have to
be specialist of a domain. There is an expertise commission in
the Ministry, which confers the title of expert to an engineer. In
front of a commission people have to show their skills and
knowledge. Then, a jury decides if you are expert or not.
(Auditor from the Ministry of Transport)
At the end of this analysis, we can see that RSA expertise
is in the heart of two paradoxes. First, auditors are both
trained to technical methods and to driving expertise. Second,
auditors are subjected to a symbolic violence in the road
engineering field structured around a distinction between
"specialized experts" and "general experts." Thus, these two
paradoxes interrogate the role and the place given to the
technical and the driving expertise in the RSA.
Method
To analyze the auditors' expertise, we have realized an eth-
nographic study. France is divided into 11 geographical areas
where auditors realize the road assessment: North-West,
South-West, Atlantic, Center-West, West, Ile-de-France,
Mediterranean, Massif Central, Center-East, North, and East.
In this study, we have interrogated 11 auditors located in the
southwest of France in the cities of Agen, Auch, Bordeaux,
Pau, and Toulouse. Auditors are road engineers who are
physically into local services, as the Interdepartmental
Direction of the Roads (IDR), the DDT, or the Technical
Studies Center of the Equipment (TSCE), but, unlike their
colleagues, the audit mission is directly reported to the
General Inspector of the Roads (GIR) from the DGTI
Through the observation of daily practices, we have
highlighted how auditors produce RSA expertise between
driving and technical knowledge. We have based this ethno-
graphic study on the "becoming-expert" approach devel-
oped by the French sociologist Jean-Yves Trépos (1996).
This consists of comprehending expertise as a social process
of knowledge acquisition through the actor's social trajecto-
ries. For Trépos, many social figures participate in the
expertise. In turn, instrument of the political domain or citi-
zen, the expert realizes his work in the convergence of sev-
eral figures. For bringing out these figures, Jean-Yves
Trépos proposes to analyze the material equipment (books,
tools, regulations) and the immaterial equipment (knowl-
edge, representations).
So, rather than sociology of expertise, we carried out soci-
ology of experts. We ran this empirical study for 1 year in the
southwest of France. We have realized 46 semi-directive
interviews. First, these interviews consisted of interrogating
auditors about their social trajectories to bring out the imma-
terial equipment acquired in each important stage of their
professional life.
Thus, concurrently with these interviews, we have real-
ized a documentary analysis of the auditors' material equip-
ment. The analysis grids are the most characteristic tools of
the auditor. There are three kinds of grids: urban grids, inter-
urban grids, and speedways assessment grids. Analysis grids
are composed of several questions which correspond with
users' interrogations in a driving situation. All these ques-
tions refer to answers from technical instructions and engi-
neering guides. Instructions are regulatory texts introduced
by a ministerial circular. They pose rules that must be
respected for building a road. Guides, for their part, are
advices for applying instructions. Instructions as guides have
a compulsory character. Auditors, as civil servants of the
Ministry, cannot infringe these technical texts except with a
ministerial decision that allows derogation.
After pursuing semi-directive interviews, we interrogated
auditors about the use of the drivers' experiences in RSA
expertise. Here, auditors had many difficulties to express
what drivers' experiential knowledge was. Evasive words
such as feelings or sensations were employed to qualify it.
So, to analyze the way in which drivers' experiences were
used, we realized direct observations of audit realization.
Conducting direct observations was a relevant method to
analyze the auditors' boundary-work. We have distinguished
two different moments in RSA expertise. The first moment
consisted of controlling the site with drivers' experiences by
driving on it and the second stage consisted, for its part, of
checking engineering norms application with analysis grids.
Here, we have observed the complexity of RSA expertise,
which both transcends and establishes boundaries between
technical and drivers' experiences. Supported by unstruc-
tured interviews, we interrogated auditors during the assess-
ment of the road and brought out the boundary-work realized
around the legitimacy of knowledge in different moments of
RSA expertise.
Carrère 5
Here, we will present results from the audit realization
observed in Lot-et-Garonne. This audit consisted of check-
ing 5.7 km of a road bypassing a town constituted by a bidi-
rectional section, a dual carriageway, and two traffic circles.
Assessing Roads With Driving
Expertise: A Cognitive Change in Road
Safety Control
Arriving at the site, auditors drove on the road at 100 km/hr,
10 km/hr above the restricted speed because they considered
that they would drive at this speed in their everyday life. In a
bend turning on the right, where overtaking was authorized
by a dotted line, auditors picked up lack of visibility of the
opposite road. This feeling was noticed and confirmed in a
second passing. Then, the auditors decided to step out of the
car and noted the presence of a noise barrier on the side of the
road. They finally concluded that acoustic screening, in an
overtaking action, concealed cars that came from the other
side of the road. They related this moment to the use of their
drivers' experiential knowledge:
That's observations or sensations of drivers. I don't know. It's
like if I said: with these sensations am I comfortable on the road
by driving at this speed? It's like sensations related to visibility.
That's feelings, drivers' feelings but only feelings you know.
(Auditor who realized the audit in Lot-et-Garonne)
In this instance, the auditors'difficulty to qualify the knowl-
edge, which participates to driving expertise, can be explicated
by the fact that auditors mobilize a tacit form of knowledge
(Polanyi, 2009), specifically a somatic tacit knowledge
(Collins, 2010). This form of tacit knowledge refers to physical
limits of human body. Indeed, if driving can be defined as the
fruit of socialization process acquired by training in a driving
school or by interacting with other drivers on the road, driving
can also be comprehended as the fruit of a bodily learning by
the apprenticeship of the reduction of field of vision caused by
speed or by the integration of road signs information in a mov-
ing car (Dant, 2004). So, we can define the auditors' tacit
knowledge as a form of bodily past experiences capitalized and
revived into the present actions (Schütz, 1967).
The utilization of the drivers' tacit knowledge can be
explicated by two forms of transformations in the methods
used in the road safety control. First is the change of the
expertise temporality. The proactive approach has been
incorporated to overcome some limitations of the reactive
approach. One of the most important critics was that reactive
approach does not anticipate accidents soon enough. Indeed,
based on the statistical study of police accident reports, the
engineering solutions are provided after accidents realiza-
tion: "Reactive approach cost a lot. There is dead and
wounded. The limits of reactive approach are to act after
accidents" (Auditor from the French Ministry of Transport).
The proactive approach held by RSA proposes to raise
accident prevention by intervening before the road is opened
to the traffic. So, the auditors' work cannot be based on sta-
tistical studies. Thus, the road safety control is realized
through an inductive approach of the infrastructure. Auditors
drive on the road to anticipate future accident occurrences on
the basis of their lay-drivers' knowledge. This new form of
temporality transforms the relation to the knowledge used
for assessing the road. Contrary to reactive approach based
on statistical report of accidents, auditors have to anticipate
what kind of accidents could happen. The proactive approach
encourages in this way the use of the lay-drivers'knowledge:
"Contrary to reactive approach, we have no accident data.
But even though we don't have data, we are able to predict
safety. This subjectivity is based on our experiences of
driver" (Auditor who realized the audit in Lot-et-Garonne).
The second change is related to the transformation of the
relation to the engineering norms. Indeed, the use of the lay-
drivers' knowledge is seen as a supplement of the limits of
technical knowledge. Norms are not considered as the sole
guarantee of safety. The technical knowledge is seen limited
for decreasing, by itself, the accident occurrences. The driv-
ers' experiential knowledge is seen as a palliative of the lim-
its of technical knowledge. This position also reveals
interrogations about a decrease in confidence assigned by
auditors to their own road safety techniques:
We can respect norms and rules and, despite everything, there are
still problems for drivers' safety. I think it is one of innovations
of RSA to say we admit that norms cannot be only efficient for
safety. Engineers evolved. Engineers are not absolutely sure that
they reach to dominate nature by techniques. When I say nature I
say physical nature and human nature and the audit embodies this
movement. (GIR, director of the audit mission)
RSA has transformed the engineering cognitive set in the
road safety control. The change in the temporality and the rela-
tion to engineering norms break off the strict technical assess-
ment held by the reactive approach. In this first stage of the
audit, the legitimacy accorded by engineers to driving exper-
tise is unquestionable. The legitimacy of drivers' experiential
knowledge comes from its capacity to transcend the limits of
the technical assessment. In a traditional technical domain as
road engineering, the legitimacy accorded to somatic tacit
knowledge based on past driving experiences is singular.
Drivers' experiences participate in practice to RSA expertise
as any other technical form of knowledge. It even appears in a
legitimate similarity, which gets around the limitation of tech-
nical knowledge. However, if the driving expertise is particu-
larly significant in the audit's first stage, during the second
stage, the technical control occupies a central space.
Assessing Roads With Technical
Knowledge: The Answer to Political
Stakes
During the second stage, auditors leave the car and walk on
the site to control correct norms application. In the case of
6 SAGE Open
Lot-et-Garonne, some failing points have been brought out.
For example, the road sign D42, which informs about the
different directions at the next crossroads, was not set up at
1.20 m from the safety barrier. Moreover, two safety barriers
at a distance of less than 150 m between each other were not
joined. This checking of norms application was realized by
the use of the analysis grids.
If the grids want to express the drivers' interrogations on
the road, auditors consider grids as a tool for applying techni-
cal rules than expressing a real drivers' point of view. For the
auditors, the compulsory character of instructions and guides,
which grids refer to, strengthens the technical vision of the
road safety assessment. In this way, grids appear as a tool that
frames the drivers' point of view in technical thought: "Grids
are made for a technical checking to see if all is conformed to
rules of road conception. So, the answers of questions from
guides are technical because the answer is based on regula-
tions" (Auditor who realized the audit in Lot-et-Garonne).
In this second stage, the centrality of the technical exper-
tise finds a political explanation. An auditor, who contributes
to the first RSA in France, explains the causes of grids incor-
poration. The analysis grids have significantly changed the
first objectives of the RSA:
The first time I realized the experimental RSA, there were no grids.
It was only our drivers'experiences and our knowledge of the road.
And, during this period, we have gone further. In addition to our
control, we invite users and policemen to assess the road in parallel.
So, during the first audit, we were more in drivers'behavior notion.
Now we are based on grids because, in the last thirty years, there
has been the creation of victim associations. Moreover, today
Medias relay information that road kills. So, the State had to set a
good example especially because since Chirac the road safety is a
national cause. So, with analysis grids we have a same technical
document of assessment in order to ensure the coherence and the
homogeneity of road safety control and consequently of
infrastructures. (Auditor from the Ministry of Transport)
Moreover, this auditor underlines that grids incorporation
echoes the change of the political road safety context. In a
decentralized State organization, where the possibilities of
pleas from victim associations against the State are more
recurrent, the Ministry of Transport protected him by the
incorporation of new procedures: "More and more victim
associations make judicial reviews. Were often are investi-
gated and blamed. Now, we have established procedures in
order to avoid that our criminal liability was called into ques-
tion" (Auditor from the Ministry of Transport).
RSA embodies one of these procedures established for
judicial protection quoted in this abstract from interviews.As
we have seen, the suppression of DCES because of its judge
and be judged position and the supervision of RSA by the
central services illustrate this movement:
The circular of 2001has incorporated a system of control in
which the contracting authority is ensured by central
administration. There is a very little delegation of power to local
services. All files are approved by the minister and for the
minister through directors of central administrations. If the
projectisapproved,itreturnstolocalservicesforimplementation.
Local services have a little room for manoeuvre. (GIR, director
of the audit mission)
Back in its territories through the RSA, the State protected
its services against pleas by implementing the same technical
tool of road safety control. By their compulsory character
and because they refer to the same engineering regulations,
the analysis grids represent a technical reference document,
which guarantees "good" realization of the road safety con-
trol and, moreover, the same road assessment all over France.
We are in a Jacobin Country. If you live in Brittany or in the
Cote d'Azur, a dual carriageway has to be made like this and not
in another way. Roads has to be homogeneous because users
must find everywhere in France road infrastructures which are
the same for its safety. (GIR, director of the audit mission)
Finally, if the technical knowledge, held by grids, is used
to control the application of engineering regulations, it is
also mobilized for political purposes. In this instance, the
political stakes about the pleas against the Ministry have
necessitated the incorporation of the same technical refer-
ence document: the analysis grids.
This empirical study shows that driving and technical
expertise both participate in the RSA assessment. But, they
are mobilized in two distinct goals. If the driving expertise is
used to transcend the limits of technical control, analysis
grids reintroduce a technical look to answer to political aims.
This observation incites an open discussion around the legiti-
macy assigned to these two forms of knowledge.
Differentiated Legitimacies: Drivers'
Experiences and Technical Knowledge
Through the Problem of Extension
The ethnographic study of the auditors shows that drivers'
experiences have acquired a real legitimacy in the road safety
control. Drivers' experiences are not marginalized. On the
contrary, they actively participate in RSA expertise just as
technical knowledge. From the reactive approach, which
realized a technical control of the road, to proactive approach
where drivers' experiences take part in the expertise, the
engineering methods of road assessment have changed.
Driving expertise, which would have been qualified as an
illegitimate form of knowledge during the period of the reac-
tive approach, now participates in the assessment as well as
the technical expertise. In the abstract of the final report
below, we can see the place given to technical and drivers'
experiences. The section written in black refers to technical
norms application related to the height of safety barriers or
the absence of road signaling. The red part refers to lay-driv-
er's knowledge and talks about the lack of visibility for over-
taking caused by noise barrier on the side of the road.

But, during this study, we do not bring out any hybridiza-
tion process. Even if driving expertise is acquired, in this
day, a real expert legitimacy in the road safety control, tech-
nical, and driving expertise appears as two distinct corpus of
knowledge, which both participate to the RSA assessment
but without interpenetration and translation process.
Despite the legitimacy assigned to driving expertise, a
boundary with the technical knowledge remains: "On the
one hand, we have the users' eyes of a lambda driver but, on
the other, we have to answer to political orders so we have
difficulties to dig out ourselves from the technical domain"
(Auditor from the Ministry of Transport).
This boundary is structured around the legitimacy
assigned to the technical and driving expertise according to
the purpose that they have to treat in the expertise. This sepa-
rated coexistence refers to the problem of extension (Collins
& Evans, 2007), defined as the moving of expertise boundar-
ies around what is considered as legitimate knowledge to
contribute to expertise (Collins & Evans, 2007).
In this instance, the founding principles of what is con-
sidered as a legitimate expertise for assessing infrastructures
have shifted. Today, the technical knowledge is no longer
considered as the sole knowledge able to guarantee by itself
the safety for users. The driving expertise appears as a new
resource of road safety assessment to mitigate the technical
limitations. But, a new form of boundary between technical
and driving expertise is maintained. The political stakes,
which RSA expertise has to answer, mark the demarcation.
Indeed, if the use of driving expertise is judged as legitimate
to guarantee the safety of users, this legitimacy disappears at
the moment when RSAhas to answer to the stakes of the judi-
cial reviews against the Ministry. Here, technical expertise
held by the analysis grids still remains the most legitimate
one.
Indeed, under what is presented as the main goal of exper-
tise, that is to say the reduction of road accidents, the driving
expertise is used in the road safety control of the infrastruc-
ture. But, regarding what are considered as peripheral stakes
of the road safety control, the technical expertise is mobi-
lized to answer to political stakes about the possibility of citi-
zen pleas against the Ministry. In this way, the legitimacy
accorded to driving expertise ends where the political stakes
begin.
Thus, this discussion should not do without a last theoreti-
cal reflection about the participation of lay-knowledge in the
expertise. If the analyses of the expert knowledge domina-
tion toward laypeople are limited, the hybridization of the
lay-knowledge seems not complete too. Indeed, this defini-
tion suggests a translation process of the lay-knowledge in
the technical expertise, that is to say a total permeation
between technical and lay-knowledge in another form of
knowledge: a socio-technical knowledge (Callon & Rip,
1992). As we have showed, the legitimacy accorded to driv-
ers' experiences ends when expertise is confronted with
political stakes. In other words, a form of lay-knowledge can
be considered as legitimate to participate in the expertise but
remains compartmentalized and assigned outside the man-
agement of political stakes.
Thus, a question has to be posed. Does the particular legiti-
macy assigned to technical knowledge in the management of
political affairs not underpin an unconscious acceptance of its
authority in this domain? Bourdieu (1984) showed that, beyond
the concepts of authority and domination, the legitimacy is also
determined by a tacit acknowledgment. Thus, if the boundaries
of what is considered as legitimate knowledge to participate in
the road safety control have changed, the legitimacy assigned to
the technical knowledge in the management of the political
domainremainstacitlyacknowledgedandrenewed.Nowadays,

in front of the increase of the citizen participation in decision
making (Blondiaux & Sintomer, 2009), the boundary between
the expert and lay-knowledge have moved. Thus, today, the
question of the lay-knowledge participation deserves to be
reexamined through the real role assigned to lay-knowledge
in the expertise and the tacit acknowledg-ment of the techni-
cal knowledge legitimacy in the political domain.
Conclusion
Given the use of new instruments of governance and legal
obligations in policy making, the expert and lay-expertise
has to be revived today. The RSA case study participates in
the revamping of this classical question in sociology through
the legitimacy issue. Instead of hybridization process or
strict opposition between technical and driving expertise, we
highlighted the auditors' boundary-work around the legiti-
macy of knowledge. We showed that knowledge participa-
tion depends on the legitimacy assigned to it in a particular
moment of the RSA expertise. In this way, we brought out a
new form of demarcation between expert and lay-knowl-
edge. If driving expertise is considered as a legitimate form
of knowledge to realize road safety control, by its capacity to
get around technical limitations, the technical expertise
remains, for its part, the most legitimate to answer the politi-
cal stakes.
In this way, the RSAcase study transcends the domination
issue of expert toward lay-expertise and also exceeds the
hybridization process. It guides to analyze the conscious or
unconscious use of the knowledge legitimacy in the frame of
the problem of extension. This new perspective leads to new
questions about the participation of lay-knowledge in deci-
sion making through the tacit acknowledgment of technical
knowledge legitimacy in political domain. If the lay-
knowledge legitimacy ends where the political stakes begin,
is it simply a showcase effect of its participation or does it
express a new State action rationality?

Notes
1. We can quote, since 1990, several cases of jurisprudence of
the Council of the State implicating the liability of the public
authority: for example, the decision of the Council of the State
no. 52866 in May 25, 1990, related to the non-indication of a
roadway slumping between 4 and 8 cm deep and 1.30 m wide;
the decision of the Council of the State no. 52867 in June 8,
1994, related to the absence of wastewater system leading to
the black ice formation; and the decision of the Council of the
State no. 164738 in May 17, 2000, related to the non-indica-
tion of the road deformation on 25 m. Moreover, we can also
underline the important role of users associations. Recently,
in 2012, the National Federation of road-accident victims has
obtained the recognition of the notion of "shortened life preju-
dice." This new judicial notion aims to compensate the fami-
lies that have lost a young family member.
2. Road safety audit (RSA) is not particular to France. Created
in 1986 in England, RSA has been incorporated in Denmark,
Australia, and New Zealand since 1990. In their turn, Canada,
the United States, Italia, Greece, The Netherlands, and France
ministries adopted this instrument during the 2000s. Since
2008, RSA is extended to all European States
3. Analysis grids have been especially realized for the RSA by
a steering committee composed of agents from technical ser-
vices of the Ministry. There are three kinds of grids about urban,
interurban roads, and speedways assessment. They have been
made on the basis of a study called "Roads and Streets Safety"
produced by two services: the Service of Studies on Transport,
Roads and their Planning (SETRA) and the Center of Studies
on Networks, Transport, Urbanism and Public Constructions
(CERTU). This study proposed a survey of several works, which
contribute to understanding users'behaviors through its interac-
tions with car and infrastructure. The analysis grid is composed
as follows: in the first row, the thematic of the issue is given
(e.g., lisibility, visibility . . . ); in the second row, the number
attached to the issue is given; in the third row, the issue is given;
in the fourth row, the reference technical document is presented;
and in the fifth and sixth rows, the answers and comments are
given, respectively. Below is an abstract from the analysis grids.
