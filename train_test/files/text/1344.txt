Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994) were used to examine the
relation between obesity and depression. Past-month depression was defined using criteria from the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, and was measured with the Diagnostic Interview
Schedule. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) of 30 or higher. The authors
compared risks of depression in obese and normal-weight (body mass index 18.5­24.9) persons. Obesity was
associated with past-month depression in women (odds ratio (OR) = 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01,
3.3) but was not significantly associated in men (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 0.56, 5.37). When obesity was stratified by
severity, heterogeneity in the association with depression was observed. Class 3 (severe) obesity (body mass
index 40) was associated with past-month depression in unadjusted analyses (OR = 4.98, 95% CI: 2.07, 11.99);
the association remained strong after results were controlled for age, education, marital status, physician's health
rating, dieting for medical reasons, use of psychiatric medicines, cigarette smoking, and use of alcohol,
marijuana, and cocaine. These findings suggest that obesity is associated with depression mainly among
persons with severe obesity. Prospective studies will be necessary to clarify the obesity-depression relation but
await the identification of potential risk factors for depression in the obese.

Obesity, an increasingly prevalent public health problem,
is strongly predictive of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
disease, chronic back pain, degenerative joint disease, and
other chronic medical conditions (1­4). Whether obesity
also predicts psychiatric disorders such as depression has not
been established. Since depression is also associated with
chronic medical conditions (5, 6), poor treatment compli-
ance, higher utilization of health services, and worse health
outcomes (5, 6), the relation between obesity and depression
is important to clinicians, researchers, and policy-makers.
Thus far, population-based studies of the association
between obesity and depression have yielded inconsistent
results (7, 8). Some studies found an association (9­14), but
others did not (15­17). Some found an association between
obesity and higher rates of depression in women but not in
men (11, 12); others reported inverse associations between
obesity and depression in both women (18, 19) and men (13,
16, 18, 19).
Methodological differences across studies have contrib-
uted to these inconsistent observations. Friedman and
Brownell noted in their 1995 review (8) that most popula-
tion-based studies had not defined depression according to
established psychiatric diagnostic criteria. The definition of
obesity also varied. Some investigators used body mass
index (BMI), defined as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters, as a continuous variable in their
analyses; others used cutpoints to define BMI categories.
More recent studies have used cutpoints recommended by

the US Public Health Service (the Public Health Service
defines obesity as a BMI at or above the 85th percentile) (20)
or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (the Insti-
tute defines obesity as a BMI of 30 or higher) (1). The use of
cutpoints defined by percentiles is problematic. BMI distri-
butions vary across subpopulations defined by age, gender,
race, geography, and time (1). Thus, cutpoints based on
percentiles may yield obesity categories that are not compa-
rable across studies.
Since the publication of Friedman and Brownell's review,
three population-based studies (9, 10, 13) have defined
depression using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth Edition (DSM-
IV) (21). Carpenter et al. (13) used data from the 1992
National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (22).
Among adults aged 18 years or more, high BMI was
inversely associated with past-year depression and suicide
ideation in men; positive associations were observed in
women. Low BMI was associated with past-year depression,
suicide attempts, and suicide ideation in men but not in
women. When BMI categories were used in the analyses,
obesity (BMI 30) was associated with past-year depression
in women and was inversely associated with it in men.
Roberts et al. (9), in older adults from the Alameda County
Study, found that obesity in 1994 (as defined by the US
Public Health Service criteria) was associated with past-year
depression in 1995, after controlling for age, sex, education,
marital status, social support, social isolation, life events,
financial strain, chronic medical conditions, and functional
disability. Health and functional disability were the most
important indicators of risk for depression in that report.
Roberts et al. examined whether the definition of obesity
affected their results. There was an association between
obesity and past-year depression in unadjusted analyses but
not in multivariable analyses when obesity was defined
using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria
(9). These findings were replicated in a 5-year study of the
same cohort (10).
Results from these studies are somewhat disparate with
respect to the risk for depression when obesity is defined
using National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria. This
may be due to heterogeneity of the obesity-depression rela-
tion across obese persons, as has been suggested in recent
reviews (7, 8). One approach to resolving this heterogeneity
is to stratify obesity by severity (class 1, BMI 30­34.9; class
2, BMI 35­39.9; class 3, BMI 40); this approach has not
previously been used. In addition, the first two studies (9, 13)
reported associations for past-year depression, the third (10)
for depression within the past 2 weeks; it is possible that the
association between obesity and depression depends on the
time frame used to measure depression.
The inconsistency of findings from previous research indi-
cates that obesity and depression do not always co-occur.
Therefore, it is necessary to ask: When does an association
between these conditions occur? Understanding when
obesity and depression co-occur in the population is impor-
tant. First, obesity and depression are common and have
important deleterious effects on a wide range of health
outcomes (1­6). Second, a subgroup of people may exist in
whom both conditions co-occur with a higher frequency than
in the general population. Indeed, clinical studies have
reported higher rates of depression and psychopathology
among persons with severe obesity (23, 24); however, clin-
ical samples represent a select population. It remains unclear
whether severely obese persons represent a subgroup of the
obese population that is at particular risk for depression.
Identifying which obese persons will also have depression
is a useful approach to resolving the heterogeneity of find-
ings from previous research. Finding this subpopulation will
also help investigators focus future research on more infor-
mative samples. By specifying an "at-risk" population,
researchers can use increasingly precise case definitions to
investigate underlying mechanisms and to develop and eval-
uate more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions
for both conditions.
In this study, we investigated whether there is any associ-
ation between obesity and depression; whether the associa-
tion between obesity and depression depends on the severity
of obesity; and whether the definition of obesity and/or
depression influences the occurrence of the association. Data
from the Third National Health and Nutritional Examination
Survey (NHANES III) (25) presented us with the opportu-
nity to address these questions in a population sample, since
a structured diagnostic interview was used to ascertain the
presence of DSM major depression in the respondents. We
assessed several hypotheses. First, we predicted that there
would be no association between obesity (BMI 30) and
depression in the NHANES III sample. Our rationale was
that obesity is a heterogeneous condition (26), and inconsis-
tent results from previous studies strongly suggested hetero-
geneity of relations (with depression) within the obesity
category (7, 8). In addition, our population sample was
young and healthy; chronic medical conditions and func-
tional disability explain much of the association in older
adults (9, 10). On the other hand, we hypothesized that
severe obesity (BMI 40) would be associated with depres-
sion. Severe obesity has been associated with depression in
clinical samples (23, 24, 27), and a population-based study
of persons aged 20­59 years found a higher prevalence of
unhappiness (in men) and sadness (in women) in the highest
tertile of relative body weight (28).
We expected the occurrence of an association between
obesity and depression to depend on the time frame used to
measure depression. The time frame used to measure depres-
sion influences the assignment of depression status. For
example, many persons with past-year depression are
excluded from the diagnosis when the past-month time
frame is used to measure depression; this can lead to error
when evaluating associations between obesity and depres-
sion. In addition, individuals' recollection of past symptoms
can change considerably over time (29); there may be differ-
ences in reliability when different time frames are used to
diagnose depression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
This was an analysis of cross-sectional data collected
during NHANES III, a survey of the US population
Is Obesity Associated with Major Depression? 1141
Am J Epidemiol 2003;158:1139­1147
involving interviews, physical and psychological examina-
tions, and collection of laboratory data. The survey was
carried out between 1988 and 1994 by the National Center
for Health Statistics. Data were weighted to produce national
estimates, with adjustments for oversampling (of young chil-
dren, the elderly, and ethnic minorities) and nonresponse.
The multistage sampling procedure has been described else-
where (25, 30). This study received approval from the
Committee for Human Research of the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health.
A total of 39,695 respondents aged 2 months to 90 years
were included in NHANES III. The response rates of 82
percent for the household interviews and 73 percent for the
examinations (unpublished data from the National Center for
Health Statistics) are typical of large surveys. In this study,
we focused on the 8,773 persons aged 15­39 years who had
been randomly selected for the structured psychiatric inter-
view. A total of 363 respondents (4.1 percent) were excluded
from the study analyses: 28 of these (0.3 percent) were
missing data on height or weight (precluding calculation of
relative body weight), and 338 (3.8 percent) were missing
data from the psychiatric interview (precluding ascertain-
ment of depression status). The final sample size for this
study was 8,410. Compared with study subjects, persons
excluded from the study were more frequently underweight
(BMI <18.5) and less frequently obese (2 test: p > 0.05; data
not shown). Those excluded more frequently had an educa-
tion of eighth grade or less and had less frequently been
educated beyond high school (2 p < 0.01). Approximately
71 percent of participants were White, as compared with 44
percent of excluded persons (2 p < 0.01); the participation
of African-American and Hispanic respondents was compa-
rable. There were no differences by gender, age, or marital
status.
Measurements
Diagnostic Interview Schedule. The Diagnostic Interview
Schedule (DIS) (31, 32) is a structured interview designed
for use by trained lay interviewers. In the NHANES III, only
the section required for diagnosis of depressive and bipolar
disorders was administered. The DIS allowed diagnoses to
be made according to operational criteria in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition
(DSM-III) (33). The DIS has been well characterized (34)
and widely used in epidemiologic field studies (35). The
DIS/DSM-III diagnosis of major depression in NHANES III
is equivalent to a diagnosis based on the DSM-IV.
Major depression. The diagnosis of DIS/DSM-III major
depression requires the persistence of depressed mood or
anhedonia for at least 2 weeks. An additional four out of
eight other possible depressive symptom groups are required
to have been clustered with depressed mood or anhedonia
during those 2 weeks. The diagnosis is not made if the
respondent attributes the symptoms to another illness, medi-
cines, or bereavement or if there is no social or occupational
impairment. In this study, the primary measure of depression
was past-month DSM-III major depression. Respondents
were also assigned a diagnosis of past-year and/or lifetime
(ever having met the criteria) major depression. Respondents
were assigned a diagnosis of recurrent major depression if
they had ever had more than one episode of depression. All
depression measures were binary (0 = no depression, 1 =
depression).
Relative body weight. Body mass index was calculated
from height and weight, which were measured by trained
technicians. Participants were grouped into four or six BMI
categories based on criteria from the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute (1). For the four-category definition,
these groups were "normal weight" (BMI 18.5­24.9; the
reference category), "underweight" (BMI <18.5), "over-
weight" (BMI 25.0­29.9), and "obese" (BMI 30). For the
six-category definition, the obese category was subdivided
into "obesity class 1" (BMI 30.0­34.9), "obesity class 2"
(BMI 35.0­39.9), and "obesity class 3" (BMI 40). We also
used BMI as a continuous variable to investigate associa-
tions over the entire range of relative body weight.
Covariates. Selection of covariates was based on the
published literature (36­44), and bivariable logistic regres-
sion analyses were performed to identify potentially
confounding factors. The potential confounders considered
were: age (15­19 (referent), 20­24, 25­29, 30­34, or 35­39
years); race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White (referent), non-
Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or other); education (8
(referent), 9­11, 12, or >12 years); marital status (married
(referent), divorced/widowed/separated, or never married);
physician's rating of health (excellent, good, or fair/poor);
dieting for medical reasons (0 = no, 1 = yes); use of psychi-
atric medicines in the past month (0 = no, 1 = yes); cigarette
smoking (never, former, or current); use of alcohol (no use,
former use, moderate use, or abuse); and ever use of mari-
juana (0 = no, 1 = yes) or cocaine (0 = no, 1 = yes).
Statistical analysis
Stata software (45) was used for all statistical analyses.
Stata uses weights and sampling data to provide corrected
standard error estimates and statistical tests. There was suffi-
cient statistical power to test the study hypotheses (table 1).
Most analyses were stratified by gender. The primary analyt-
ical method was estimation of the relative odds for depres-
sion in each obesity class. The multivariable logistic
regression model included the potential confounders.
Logistic regression analyses were performed for each defini-
tion of DSM-III major depression (past-month, past-year,
lifetime, and recurrent) and for each measure of relative
body weight (continuous BMI, four BMI categories, and six
BMI categories).
RESULTS
The demographic characteristics of the respondents are
shown in table 2. Men and women did not differ significantly
in terms of age, race/ethnicity, education status, or area of
residence (urban vs. rural). Equal proportions of men and
women were currently married. Greater than twofold more
women than men were separated, widowed, or divorced (2
p < 0.0001); more men than women had never been married
(2 p < 0.0001). The sample was 53.9 percent normal weight,
3.7 percent underweight, 26.1 percent overweight, and 16.3
1142 Onyike et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2003;158:1139­1147
percent obese (data not shown). A higher proportion of
women than of men were in obesity classes 2 and 3, and
more men than women were overweight (2 p < 0.0001).
The prevalence of past-month DSM-III major depression,
by relative body weight, is shown in table 3. As expected,
women had an approximately 2.5-fold higher prevalence of
past-month depression than men; this is consistent with
results from other population-based prevalence studies that
used the DIS and DSM-III criteria to identify cases, as well
as with results from studies that used other measurement
methods (46). The prevalence of past-month depression was
higher in obese subjects than in normal-weight subjects.
There was heterogeneity in the prevalence rates across the
subclasses of obesity, with the highest rates of depression
occurring in obesity class 3. Prevalence rates for depression
in the underweight and overweight were not different from
those in the normal-weight. Results were similar for past-
year, lifetime, and recurrent depression (data not shown).
Among women, the prevalence of depression was higher
with increasing levels of obesity. Among men, prevalence
rates were lowest in obesity class 2 and highest in obesity
class 3.
Unadjusted odds ratios for the association between relative
body weight and measures of depression are shown in table
4. Analyses were stratified by gender. Obesity (BMI 30)
was associated with past-month depression in women (odds
ratio (OR) = 1.82, 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.01,
3.3) but not in men (OR = 1.73, 95 percent CI: 0.56, 5.37).
There was an association between obesity class 3 (BMI 40)
and past-month depression in both women (OR = 3.78, 95
percent CI: 1.64, 8.68) and men (OR = 7.68, 95 percent CI:
1.03, 57.26). There was also an association between obesity
class 3 and lifetime depression in women (OR = 2.15, 95
percent CI: 1.17, 3.92). The odds ratios for risk of past-year
(and recurrent) depression in obesity class 3 were not statis-
tically significant. In women, we observed a trend of higher

odds ratios with increasing levels of obesity for past-month,
past-year, and lifetime depression.
Adjusted odds ratios for the association between relative
body weight and past-month depression are shown in table 5.
Data presented are for the total population and include esti-
mates of association with depression for all covariates in the
model. Obesity class 3 was associated with depression
(OR = 4.63, 95 percent CI: 2.06, 10.42). Similar results were
observed for women (data not shown); there were too few
obesity class 3 men with depression for meaningful multi-
variable analyses. Female gender, current smoking, and use
of psychiatric medicines were also associated with depres-
sion in these analyses. In post-hoc analyses, there was no
evidence of interaction between gender or age and obesity
(or any obesity class) in the association with depression.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated severity of obesity (as
defined by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
criteria) as a potential discriminator between obese persons
with depression and those without depression. We also
examined how definitions of obesity and depression may
affect the occurrence of an association between these condi-
tions in epidemiologic studies. Early population-based
studies showed an inconsistent relation between obesity and
major depression, with the preponderance of the evidence
suggesting that no association existed between obesity and
depression (see Friedman and Brownell's review (8)). These
studies typically treated obesity as a unitary construct, an
approach that potentially obscures any heterogeneity of rela-
tions with depression (7, 8). More recent studies have shown
an association between obesity and depression (9, 10, 13).
Data from clinic samples also support the presence of an
association (8, 23, 24, 27). In the most recent reviews, Faith
et al. (7) and Friedman and Brownell (8) concluded that there
are probably multiple relations between obesity and depres-
sion. They have proposed a "second generation" of research
that would focus on identifying potential risk factors for
depression within the obese population (in preparation for
future prospective multivariable studies). We implemented
that approach in this study by investigating severe obesity as
a potential risk factor for depression.
We found that the association between obesity and depres-
sion depends on the severity of the obesity. Obese persons
had an approximately 1.5-fold higher prevalence of past-
month depression than their normal-weight counterparts.
Among women, obesity was associated with 82 percent
higher odds of past-month depression; the estimate of 73
percent higher odds in men was not statistically significant.
These data were inconsistent with our first hypothesis, which
predicted null results. However, among the obese, there was
heterogeneity in rates of the prevalence of past-month
depression. The prevalence of depression was highest in
persons with severe obesity (BMI 40). Consistent with our
second hypothesis, there was a strong association between
severe obesity and depression in logistic regression analyses;
when we adjusted for potential confounders to assess
whether obesity was independently associated with depres-
sion, the association remained strong.
The association between obesity and depression is sensi-
tive to the definition of obesity. This is hardly surprising,

since specific conditions exist for the association (severe
obesity, in this study). The time frame used to define cases of
DIS/DSM-III major depression had only a small effect on
the presence of association, especially when obesity was
stratified by severity. When depression is defined using
DSM criteria, the presence of an association may not be
sensitive to the time frame used to measure depression. This
may be partly explained by depression's being a chronic
condition, and it is of value to researchers in this field in that
it suggests that DSM depression within the past year is a reli-
able measure. Thus, the definition of obesity is the more
important determinant of the occurrence of an association
with depression. We did not observe any associations when
BMI was used as a continuous measure. BMI is an unsatis-
factory measure when used as a continuous variable--which
requires the assumption that the relation between obesity and
depression is linear across the entire range of relative body
weights. Empirical research suggests that health risks are not
linearly distributed across the entire range of relative body
weights; health risks are dramatically higher in the obese (1,
3, 4), particularly the severely obese (1). As we noted above,
when BMI was categorized, heterogeneity in depression risk
was observed and severe obesity was associated with depres-
sion.

Is Obesity Associated with Major Depression? 1145
Am J Epidemiol 2003;158:1139­1147
Our results complement findings from other population-
based studies that investigated the relation between obesity
and DSM major depression. Carpenter et al. (13) found an
association between obesity and depression in women; their
inverse association in men may correspond to our finding of
a relatively low prevalence of depression in obesity class 2
men (which was not statistically significant in logistic
regression analyses). Roberts et al. (9, 10) found associations
between obesity and depression among older adults with a
relatively high prevalence of chronic medical conditions and
functional disability--the principal indicators of risk for
depression in their studies. In contrast, we sampled young
adults in whom chronic medical conditions and functional
disability were of very low prevalence and were not associ-
ated with depression. Palinkas et al. (16) also studied older
adults but did not find any association between obesity and
depression (defined by scores on the Beck Depression Inven-
tory (47)). These studies did not examine associations across
levels of obesity. In another study, Britz et al. (27) compared
a clinic sample of severely obese adolescents with obese and
normal-weight adolescents from the population and found
higher rates of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders in the clinic-
based case adolescents. Since the clinic-based case children
were considerably more obese than the population-based
case children, the investigators could not determine whether
the higher rates of psychiatric disorders were related to
severe obesity or to treatment-seeking behavior.
This study had several strengths. First, the sample was
drawn from the general household population of the United
States, thereby minimizing the selection biases of clinical
samples. Second, DSM-III diagnostic criteria were applied
using data from a structured psychiatric lay interview
method (the DIS); the DIS/DSM-III diagnosis of major
depression was equivalent to a DSM-IV diagnosis. Third, we
stratified the analyses by gender, which allowed us to iden-
tify gender-specific patterns of association. Fourth, we were
able to examine the association between obesity and depres-
sion within subclasses of obesity. Finally, to our knowledge,
this is the only study that has assessed the impact on the

association between the two conditions of using different
time frames to ascertain depression.
Our study also had limitations. First, the design was cross-
sectional; a temporal relation between obesity and depres-
sion could not be inferred. Second, we had data only on
persons aged 15­39 years. Thus, the study was limited to
that age group. Third, the size of the male subpopulation was
too small for us to test for an independent association of
severe obesity with depression. However, the sample size
was adequate for our primary hypotheses. Fourth, lay inter-
viewers may collect clinical data of limited quality, since
they are not trained to probe responses; thus, the validity of
diagnoses based on lay interviews can be questioned (48,
49). In addition, problems with the accuracy of the DIS for
diagnosing depression (and other psychiatric disorders) have
been reported (50, 51), and diagnostic agreement between
the DIS and a psychiatrist's interview is higher in clinical
samples than in community samples (34). Furthermore,
nonspecific symptoms such as change in appetite, fatigue,
insomnia, and loss of libido are included in the DSM-III
diagnostic criteria for depression. These symptoms may be
more common in the severely obese (because of a higher
prevalence of chronic medical conditions), making careful
attribution of symptoms (which requires clinical training) a
critical factor in the diagnostic process. However, use of the
DIS is a tremendous improvement over use of continuous
scales (such as the Beck Depression Inventory (47), the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (52), and
the scale of Zung et al. (53)), and our results are consistent
with findings from clinical studies. In addition, it is prohibi-
tively expensive to use clinically trained interviewers to
ascertain diagnoses in large community surveys.
Our findings indicate that informative approaches to the
study of the association between obesity and psychiatric
outcomes include the stratification of obesity by severity and
the use of DSM definitions of psychiatric disorder. Persons
with severe obesity may represent an "at-risk" population in
which mechanisms linking obesity to depression can be prof-
itably investigated. This association between severe obesity
and depression is also of interest to clinicians, since depres-
sion is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. It is
important to evaluate and treat depression in persons who
seek medical treatment for severe obesity, and it may be that
routine screening for depression should be formulated as the
standard of care for these patients.
More research is needed to clarify the relation between
severe obesity and depression. For instance, the association
may be bidirectional (7). In addition, it remains unclear
whether gender, age, race, and socioeconomic status influ-
ence this association. The use of DSM criteria for the diag-
nosis of depression in population-based studies has been an
important step forward, but research measures will have
enhanced construct validity when interviewers are clinically
trained. Clinic-based samples will be useful for identifying
other potential risk factors for depression in the obese, since
they often represent the extreme of disease or syndrome
presentations and thus may minimize ambiguity in case defi-
nitions and heterogeneity in research samples. Prospective
studies will ultimately be required in order to clarify the
temporal relation between obesity and depression, but these
studies must await the identification of potential risk factors
for depression in the obese. These studies will require active
collaboration between investigators to surmount the chal-
lenges involved, which include high costs, the need for large
study samples, lengthy follow-up, and repeated assessments,
and the problem of censorship in studies of long duration.
