ACONFLUENCE OF FORCES HAS
changed the practice of medi-
cine in unprecedented ways
during the past decade. There
is increasing focus on, and concern
about, the quality of medical care,1,2 fi-
nancial constraints are being applied
more frequently and stringently, and the
practice and management of medical
care have become increasingly central-
ized and dominated by managed care
and physician organizations.3-5 Whereas
physicians once practiced primarily
alone or in small autonomous groups,
they now are more likely to practice in
large groups and are increasingly sub-
jected to profiling, administrative re-
quirements, and preapproval for proce-
duresandtreatments.Evidencesuggests
that some physicians are becoming un-
happy in this environment.6
Understanding trends in physician
career satisfaction and how changes in
the practice environments of physi-
cians affect their career satisfaction is
important for several reasons. First,
physician satisfaction is associated with
quality of care, particularly as mea-
sured by patient satisfaction.7,8 Sec-
ond, dissatisfied physicians are more
likely to leave the profession and dis-
courage others from entering.9-11 This
is disruptive to patient-physician rela-
tionships, costly to physician prac-
tices, and could ultimately diminish the

Context A number of forces have changed the practice of medicine in the past decade.
Evidence suggests that physicians are becoming less satisfied in this environment.
Objectives To describe changes in career satisfaction in a large, nationally repre-
sentative sample of physicians and to examine market and practice factors associated
with changes in physician satisfaction.
Design and Setting Data were collected from the first 3 rounds of the Community
Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey, a series of nationally representative telephone
surveys of physicians in 60 US sites conducted in 1996-1997 (round 1: 12385 respon-
dents; 65% response rate), 1998-1999 (round 2: 12280 respondents; 61% response
rate), and 2000-2001 (round 3: 12389 respondents; 59% response rate) for the Cen-
ter for Studying Health System Change. The second and third rounds of the survey
included physicians sampled in the previous round, as well as new physicians.
Participants Primary care and specialist physicians who spent at least 20 hours per
week in direct patient care activities.
Main Outcome Measures Changes in physicians' overall satisfaction with their
career and the proportion of dissatisfied physicians in particular sites.
Results Physician satisfaction levels declined marginally between 1997 and 2001, with
most of the decline occurring between 1997 and 1999. Among primary care physicians,
42.4% were very satisfied in 1997, as were 43.3% of specialists, compared with 38.5%
and 41.4%, respectively, in 2001. There were nearly equal increases in those who re-
ported that they were somewhat satisfied. Overall means mask significant differences
across the 60 sites. Among 12 sites randomly selected for more intensive study, the pro-
portion of respondents who were somewhat or very dissatisfied ranged from 8.8% of
physicians in Lansing, Mich (1999), to 34.2% in Miami, Fla (1997). Between 1997 and
1999, 25.6% of primary care physicians reported decreased satisfaction and 18.1% re-
ported improved satisfaction, while approximately equal percentages reported increased
(19.8%) and decreased (20.4%) satisfaction between 1999-2001. Findings were similar
for specialist physicians. In multivariable models, the strongest and most consistent pre-
dictors of change in satisfaction were changes in measures of clinical autonomy, includ-
ing increases in hours worked and physicians' ability to obtain services for their patients.
Changes in exposure to managed care were weakly related to changes in satisfaction.
Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that overall physician satisfaction levels over
this time period did not change dramatically. In addition, satisfaction and changes in
satisfaction vary greatly among sites. Rather than declining income, threats to physi-
cians' autonomy, to their ability to manage their day-to-day patient interactions and
their time, and to their ability to provide high-quality care are most strongly associ-
ated with changes in satisfaction.

overall quality of care if potentially out-
standing physicians are dissuaded from
choosing this career.12 Finally, career
dissatisfaction might be one manifes-
tation of physicians' perceptions of
problems in delivering high-quality care
to their patients.13
To examine trends in career satisfac-
tion, we administered surveys 2 years
apart to a nationally representative
sample of primary care physicians
(PCPs) and specialist physicians drawn
from local health care markets through-
out the country.13,14 The 60 nationally
representative sites include both large
and small metropolitan areas, rural
counties, and areas with both high and
low penetration of managed care. In ad-
dition, we also used a longitudinal ap-
proach that overcomes some inherent
limitationsofcross-sectionalstudies.We
had 3 primary questions. First, is over-
all career satisfaction changing over
time? Second, how do changes in phy-
sician satisfaction vary by market and by
specialty? Third, to what extent are
changes in physicians' practice environ-
ments and local markets associated with
changes in their satisfaction?
METHODS
Data Source
Data for this study are from the first 3
rounds of the Community Tracking
Study (CTS) Physician Survey, a se-
ries of 3 nationally representative tele-
phone surveys of physicians con-
ducted in 1996-1997 (round 1: 12385
respondents; 65% response rate), 1998-
1999 (round 2: 12280 respondents;
61% response rate), and 2000-2001
(round 3: 12389 respondents; 59% re-
sponse rate) for the Center for Study-
ing Health System Change.14 The sur-
vey samples were designed to be
representative of physicians directly
providing patient care in the continen-
tal United States, as well as in selected
communities. Each survey round used
a complex sample clustered in 60 ran-
domly selected sites and a small, inde-
pendently drawn, unclustered na-
tional sample comprising about 10% of
all interviews used to increase the pre-
cision of national estimates.15
In each site, we sampled physicians
from the master files of the American
Medical Association and the American
Osteopathic Association. The sample
included active nonfederal office- and
hospital-based physicians who spent at
least20hoursperweekindirectpatient
care, but excluded specialties such as
radiology, pathology, and anesthesiol-
ogy. We oversampled PCPs, including
those in family practice, general prac-
tice, general internal medicine, inter-
nal medicine/pediatrics, pediatrics, and
geriatricmedicine.Thesecondandthird
rounds of the survey included por-
tions of physicians sampled in the pre-
vious round, as well as new physi-
cians. This approach created 2 panels
of physicians, the first interviewed in
bothrounds1and2andtheotherinter-
viewed in both rounds 2 and 3.
To create the first panel (round
1-round 2), 9353 of the 12385 respon-
dents (76%) to the first round were con-
tacted in the second round. Of these, a
total of 915 had become ineligible be-
cause they had retired, worked fewer
than 20 hours per week, or were unlo-
catable. From the remaining 8438 we
received 6569 responses, for a panel re-
sponse rate of 78%. A further 650 were
eliminated because they changed sites
or PCP status between rounds or were
not practicing in the 60 sites, leaving a
final sample of 5919 (3476 PCPs and
2443 specialists). To create the sec-
ond panel (round 2-round 3), 11394
of the 12280 respondents to the second-
round survey were contacted in the
third round. Of these, a total of 671 had
become ineligible. From the remain-
ing 10 723 we received 7723 re-
sponses, for a panel response rate of
72%. A further 976 were eliminated be-
cause they changed sites or PCP sta-
tus between rounds or were not prac-
ticing in the 60 sites, leaving a final
sample of 6747 (4257 PCPs and 2490
specialists). Some physicians were
sampled in both panels. Item nonre-
sponse for both rounds of the survey
was very low, typically less than 3%, and
less than 0.5% for the dependent vari-
ables. A few independent variables were
imputed using hot-deck procedures.16
Greater detail about the surveys is avail-
able elsewhere.14-17
Assessing Physician
Career Satisfaction
In the first section of the survey, physi-
cians were asked: "Thinking very gen-
erally about your satisfaction with your
overallcareerinmedicine,wouldyousay
that you are currently very satisfied,
somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatis-
fied, very dissatisfied, or neither satis-
fied nor dissatisfied." These responses
were coded on a scale from 5 to 1 with
"neither satisfied nor dissatisfied" being
codedas3.Inadditiontoreportingover-
all satisfaction levels, we also report sat-
isfaction levels by market for 12 of the
markets that were selected randomly for
moreintensivestudy.Thesesiteshadsur-
vey samples large enough (approxi-
mately 500 physicians per round) to
draw conclusions about changes over
timeandwerethesubjectofin-depthsite
visits that were conducted concur-
rently with each round of the survey.
We determined changes in satisfac-
tion for the panel respondents by cal-
culating the differences in reported
satisfaction for participants in consecu-
tive rounds of the survey, with the re-
sulting variable ranging from +4 to -4.
Independent Variables Affecting
Changes in Physician Satisfaction
The literature suggests that changes in
physician career satisfaction may be in-
fluenced by 3 general factors: changes
in the physician's practice environ-
ment, including the income they de-
rive from practice and hours worked;
changes in physicians' autonomy as
measured by perceptions of their abil-
ity to provide high-quality care to their
patients and to obtain needed medical
services for them; and changes in the
the local market.
Independent variables used to as-
sess changes in physician satisfaction
for the panel respondents were gener-
ally constructed either as changes in a
continuous variable or as sets of cat-
egorical variables. For continuous vari-
ables, the preceding value (from ei-
ther round 1 or round 2) was subtracted

from the later value (from either round
2 or round 3). For categorical vari-
ables, dummy variables were con-
structed indicating an increase or de-
crease in the variable, with those
physicians with no (or small) change
serving as the reference group.
Practice Environment
We measured changes in several at-
tributes of physicians' practice envi-
ronments, including practice size, own-
ership, and involvement with managed
care. The survey assessed size (dichoto-
mized to 10 or 10 physicians) and
type of practice (physician group, staff/
group model health maintenance or-
ganization [HMO], medical schoolÂ­
based practice, hospital-owned practice,
or another setting). After exploring al-
ternative specifications, we created
dummy variables indicating whether
physicians changed from a larger to
smaller practice setting or vice versa.
Changes in ownership were cap-
tured by 2 dummy variables indicat-
ing whether the physician was a full or
partial owner who became a non-
owner or vice versa. A dichotomous
variable indicated whether the physi-
cian's practice had been acquired in the
preceeding 2 years.
Changes in the physicians' patient
population were assessed with 2 con-
tinuous variables measuring changes in
the percentage of practice revenue from
Medicaid and Medicare.
Changes in the practice's overall ex-
posure to financial influences of man-
aged care were examined using con-
tinuous variables measuring changes in
the proportion of total practice rev-
enue derived from managed care and
changes in the proportion of managed
care revenues received in the form of
capitation.
To measure effects of various admin-
istrative care management strategies,
physicians were asked, on a 6-point
scale ranging from "very large" to "no
effect," the extent to which practice pro-
filing, patient satisfaction surveys, and
guidelines affected their practice of
medicine. Because responses to these
questions varied little over time, and be-
cause these variables were not signifi-
cant in preliminary analyses, they were
not included in the final analysis.
Changes in work effort were as-
sessed by categorical variables, indicat-
ing whether the number of hours
workedthepreviousweekchangedfrom
fewer than 60 hours to more than 60
hours, or vice versa. Change in income
was included as a categorical variable in-
dicating that income increased or de-
creased by at least 5% after accounting
for inflation. A measure of income per
work effort based on hours worked in
the prior week was correlated with the
income measure, and was therefore not
included in final analyses.
Professional Autonomy
Professional autonomy refers to indi-
viduals' ability to control the terms and
contentoftheirwork.Basedonthework
of the Society of General Internal Medi-
cine Task Force on Physician Satisfac-
tion, we identified 2 general influences
on clinical autonomy: control over work
and ability to provide needed ser-
vices.13,18,19 To measure clinical au-
tonomy, we created a summary score
based on responses to a set of 5 ques-
tions assessing these factors. Respon-
dentsfirstwereaskedtheirlevelofagree-
ment with a general statement regarding
the ability to provide high-quality care
and with 3 statements related to as-
pects of the process of care delivery:
whether they had adequate time with
patients, freedom to make clinical de-
cisions, and the ability to form continu-
ing relationships with patients over time
that promote the delivery of high-
quality care. Response categories in-
cluded agree strongly, agree some-
what,neitheragreenordisagree,disagree
somewhat,anddisagreestrongly.Anex-
ploratory factor analysis indicated that
there was a single underlying con-
struct to the questions. Since the factor
loadings were almost equal, we created
the index by summing up the re-
sponses. The resulting index was highly
internally consistent (Cronbach , .82).
Primary care physicians and special-
ists were also asked to rate the appro-
priateness of the level of patient com-
plexity that they were expected to
address prior to or at the time of refer-
ral, respectively.20 We constructed cat-
egorical variables indicating increases
or decreases in each of these variables
between the 2 rounds of the survey.
We measured ability to provide
needed services with a series of 5-point
questions that were combined to con-
struct 3 indices by averaging compo-
nent variables: ability to obtain outpa-
tient services ("index 1," including 3
items related to obtaining referrals to
specialists, ancillary services, and di-
agnostic imaging), ability to obtain hos-
pitalizations ("index 2," including 2
items related to obtaining hospitaliza-
tions and length of stay), and ability to
obtain mental health services ("index
3," including 2 items related to obtain-
ing outpatient mental health treat-
ment and inpatient mental health
hospitalizations). The mental health
questions were only asked of PCPs, psy-
chiatrists, and obstetricians/gynecolo-
gists. Change scores were then calcu-
lated for each index. A dummy variable
was created to account for physicians
who did not routinely need the appli-
cable services (eg, some specialists
rarely hospitalize patients).
Market-Level Changes
To assess changes in measures of man-
aged care penetration, we created vari-
ables by subtracting site-level aver-
ages of the percentage of physician
revenue from managed care, and also
the percentage of physician revenue that
was capitated.
Cross-sectional Analyses
For descriptive analyses, we used t tests
to examine changes in continuous vari-
ables and the 2 test for dichotomous
and categorical variables. We com-
puted descriptive information on over-
all satisfaction using the cross-
sectional information from the 3 rounds
of the survey. Because the characteris-
tics of the sample changed somewhat
over time, we computed regression-
adjusted mean satisfaction levels for
rounds 2 and 3 based on the composi-
tion of the first round of the survey.

Longitudinal Analyses. We investi-
gated determinants of career satisfac-
tion by evaluating changes in satisfac-
tion for the longitudinal panels of
physicians. Cross-sectional studies of
physician career satisfaction can be bi-
ased because unobserved physician
preferences may affect their practice
choices (eg, involvement with man-
aged care, size of practice) as well as
their career satisfaction. In a longitu-
dinal first-differences model, in which
the dependent and independent vari-
ables are mostly expressed in terms of
their changes over time, unobserved
physician preferences, as well as ob-
servable physician characteristics, are
held constant because we are only look-
ing at changes affecting a given physi-
cian over time. The inclusion of base-
line career satisfaction in the regression
models also allows us to control for
possible bias due to floor and ceiling
effects as well as for the tendency of
individual physicians to rate their
satisfaction more or less highly.
We used ordinary least-squares re-
gressions to investigate multivariable re-
lationships. For these models, we com-
bined both panels into a single data set
because our model suggests that the de-
terminants of satisfaction would not
change appreciably over time. We es-
timated separate models for PCPs and
specialist physicians because we
thought that changes in the practice en-
vironment and autonomy might be ex-
pected to affect generalists and special-
ists differently. We first examined
bivariate relationships. Variables that
were not significantly related to changes
in satisfaction at P.10 in either bivar-
iate or multivariable models were elimi-
nated from the models. This did not re-
sult in significant changes for any of the
remaining coefficients. Because they
were a primary interest of this study,
variables related to exposure to man-
aged care at both the individual and
market level were also included in the
final model. All analyses were done us-
ing SUDAAN v8.01 (RTI Interna-
tional, Research Triangle Park, NC) to
control for the complex sample de-
sign and use weights created for the
panel.14 The SUDAAN software also ac-
counts for the nonindependence of ob-
servations when the same physician is
included in both panels.
Each category of characteristics (for
instance, changes in practice environ-
ment or changes in physician au-
tonomy) was entered individually and
then in combination to examine both
direct and indirect effects. For in-
stance, we speculated that changes in
satisfaction related to managed care ex-
posure might be mediated by changes
in professional autonomy, so we ex-
amined these groups of variables indi-
vidually and in combination. For each
subgroup, variables were first exam-
ined for collinearity. Correlations were
below levels at which multicollinear-
itywouldbeconsideredlikely(r0.30).
We report results from the model in-
cluding all categories of independent
variables because individual coeffi-
cients remained robust when alterna-
tive specifications were tested.
We also performed additional ex-
ploratory multivariable analyses at the
site level, using the combined panel data
sets. For these analyses, we created site-
level means of physician satisfaction as
well as independent variables related to
managed care exposure and distribu-
tion of patients across public and pri-
vate payers. We also used information
from Interstudy21 and the Bureau of
Health Professions Area Resource File22
to examine physician, hospital, and
health plan concentration.
RESULTS
The characteristics of the respondents
across the 3 rounds of the survey are
presented in TABLE 1. Among primary
care physicians, 23.6% were women in
1997 and this increased to almost 31%
in 2001 (P.01). Fourteen percent of
specialists were women in 1997, as were
18.7% in 2001 (P.01). A slightly
higher proportion of PCPs were inter-
national medical graduates (21.3%-
24.9% [1997 and 2001, respectively],
compared with 18.5%-18.8% for
specialists). Among PCPs in 1997,
33.1% were internists, 21.0% were pe-
diatricians, and the remainder were ei-
ther family physicians or general prac-
titioners. By 2001, the proportion that
were internists had increased to 37.3%,
with an accompanying decrease in the
proportion of family physicians to gen-
eral practitioners. Among specialists,
the share of medical specialties in-
creased from 40.3% in round 1 to 47.6%
in round 3, while the surgical special-
ties decreased from 36.7% to 31.3%
(P.01).
Physician Career Satisfaction,
1997-2001
Physician career satisfaction levels de-
clined marginally between 1997 and
2001 (TABLE 2), although there did not
appear to be a clear trend over that time
period. In addition, modest declines
noted between 1997 and 1999 ap-
peared to moderate by 2001. There were
no significant differences between lev-
els in 1999 and 2001. For instance,
42.4% of PCPs and 43.3% of special-
ists were very satisfied in 1997, com-
pared with 38.5% and 41.4%, respec-
tively, in 1999 (P.001 for PCPs and
P.01 for specialists). For PCPs, how-
ever, this was accompanied by an off-
setting increase in the percentage of
physicians who were somewhat satis-
fied (P.001). The proportion of spe-
cialists who were somewhat dissatis-
fied also increased between 1997 and
1999, from 12.9% to 14.8% (P.05).
We also examined changes in ca-
reer satisfaction for physicians in-
cluded in the 2 panel samples
(TABLE 3). Overall, 25.7% of physi-
cians reported decreased satisfaction be-
tween 1997 and 1999, and this propor-
tion was similar for both PCPs and
specialists. Only 17.9% reported in-
creased satisfaction. In contrast, be-
tween 1999-2001, approximately equal
numbers of physicians in the panel re-
ported decreased (21.4%) and in-
creased (19.7%) satisfaction.
These overall means mask signifi-
cant site-level variation. Across the 12
high-intensity sites, the percentage of
physicians who were somewhat or very
dissatisfied ranged from a low of 8.8%
of physicians in Lansing, Mich, in round
2 to a high of 34.2% of physicians in

Miami, Fla, in round 1 (FIGURE), and
these were reflective of the range of
variation seen across the full sample of
60 sites. More physicians in 7 of these
12 markets were dissatisfied in 2001 vs
1997, with the biggest change occur-
ring in Syracuse, NY, where the per-
centage of somewhat or very dissatis-
fied physicians increased from 14% to
21% during the time period of the study.
Among the markets with the highest
proportion of dissatisfied physicians in
1997 (including Newark, NJ [24%], Or-
ange County, Calif [27%], and Miami,
Fla [34%]), dissatisfaction levels ap-
peared to moderate by 2001. Multivari-
able analyses to understand further
changes in satisfaction at the market
level revealed only a single significant
predictor.Increasingproportionofcapi-
tated managed care revenue in a mar-
ket was associated with decreased sat-
isfaction (P=.01) among physicians in
that market.

a single regression. Primary care phy-
sicians and specialists who became
owners of their practices were more
likely to report increased satisfaction
(P.01 and P.001, respectively) while
PCPs who reported increases in the
number of hours they worked, from less
than 60 to more than 60 hours per
week, reported decreased satisfaction
(P.01). Income was not related to
changes in specialist satisfaction, but
changes in satisfaction among PCPs
were significantly related to income
(P.01). Changes in exposure to man-
aged care were generally not related to
changes in satisfaction.
Changes in Professional Autonomy.
The most consistent predictors of
changes in both PCP and specialist ca-
reer satisfaction were changes in mea-
sures related to clinical autonomy. Pri-
mary care physicians who reported
increasesinthelevelofpatientcomplex-
ity that they were expected to address
without referral were more likely to re-
port decreased satisfaction (P.01).
Similarly,bothPCPsandspecialistswho
reported more difficulty obtaining high-
quality outpatient services (P.01) and
inpatient services (P.05) were also
more likely to be report decreased sat-
isfaction with their careers. Finally,
changes in the clinical autonomy scale,
which measures physicians' ability to
provide high-quality care, maintain con-
tinuing patient relationships, adequacy
of time with patients, and freedom to
makeclinicaldecisions,werestronglyre-
lated to changes in satisfaction for both
PCPs and specialists (P.001 for both).
Changes in Market-Level Charac-
teristics. Primary care physicians in
markets with increased proportions of
managed care revenue in the form of
capitation were significantly less satis-
fied (P.01), while specialists' satis-
faction was not related to changes in the
market-level measures of managed care.
Lastly, we also examined predictors of
changes in satisfaction at the market
level. Both increased market-level man-
aged care penetration and higher pro-
portions of capitated managed care rev-
enue were associated with decreases in
market-level physician satisfaction.
COMMENT
Despite a lack of systematic data, many
observers perceived a decline in phy-
sician career satisfaction. As physi-
cian practice continues to evolve, it be-
comes increasingly important to
understand how satisfaction is chang-
ing and whether managers and policy
makers at the local or national level can
influence these changes.
In this national study of satisfaction
among a large representative sample of
physicians, we find several notable re-
sults.First,ourfindingsdemonstratethat
overalllevelsofcareersatisfactionamong
physicians over this time period did not
change dramatically, although there ap-
peared to be a slight decline between
1997 and 1999. Second, national-level
data mask significant variation in local
markets. These findings suggest that
changes in physician satisfaction may be
significantly influenced by local phe-
nomena. Third, we found that changes
inphysicians'clinicalautonomy,includ-
ing their ability to obtain needed out-
patient and inpatient services, were the
most consistent and powerful predic-
tors of changes in their levels of satis-
factionovertime.Changeinincomewas
asignificantpredictoronlyforPCPs,and
change in practice ownership was sig-
nificant for both PCPs and specialists.
A number of other possible influences,
suchasmanagedcarepenetrationwithin
physicians' practices, had little appar-
ent effect.
Changes in autonomy cannot be at-
tributed simply to the spread of man-
aged care, since managed care vari-
ables generally were not important
predictors of change in satisfaction,
even in models that did not include the
change in autonomy measures.23 In-
stead, more subtle factors seem to be
at work. These may be related to un-
measured differences in managed care
organizations in different communi-
ties, or in how physicians' organiza-
tions respond to managed care. In ad-
dition, it could also reflect changes in
the intensity of managed care prac-
tices over the time period, such as those
related to increasing use of certain types
of capitation, which we were unable to
measure.

determinantsofphysiciansatisfactionre-

sponse rates, or rely on sequential cross-
sectional data, thus failing to fully con-
trol for personal characteristics of the
physicians.6,26,28 Furthermore, previ-
ous research has not examined whether
changes in satisfaction vary across lo-
cal health care markets. If differences do
exist across markets, this might pre-
sent opportunities for managers and
policy makers to understand and target
factors important to physician satisfac-
tioninparticularmarkets.Thisstudyad-
dresses many of these methodological
limitations and takes advantage of the
ability to use representative cross-
sectional data as well as longitudinal in-
formation to analyze the determinants
of changes in satisfaction.
Our findings related to variationinlo-
cal markets merit attention because
cross-sectional satisfaction levels across
markets and changes in satisfaction lev-
els both varied substantially across mar-
kets. To our knowledge, no previous
studyhasdocumentedthesemarkeddif-
ferences in satisfaction across markets.
Many have observed that "all health care
is local" and these findings appear con-
sistent with this view.29 We attempted to
explain changes in satisfaction at the site
level through multivariable models.
However, the small number of sites, the
small number of respondents in some
sites, and resulting limits in statistical
powerprecludedmeaningfulanalysisus-
ing the market as the level of analysis.
Wedidfind,however,thatincreasedlev-
els of capitation within managed care
were associated with decreased satisfac-
tion at the site level, despite there being
no relationship at the individual level.
The latter finding suggests that increas-
ing capitation at the market level may be
a marker for more aggressive managed
care practices that can lead to subtle
changes in practice norms and that may
limit physicians' opportunities to es-
cape these managed care influences by
movingtodifferentpracticesinthesame
market. This effect may operate through
market-level influences on physicians'
professional autonomy.
Other measures of market character-
istics,suchashospitalconcentrationand
physiciandensity,didnotprovetobeim-
portant predictors of changes in physi-
cian satisfaction. This might be because
localmarketsdiffersubstantiallyinways
thataredifficulttomeasure.Theserange
from subtle variations in practice norms
and patient expectations to more basic
differences in the structure and organi-
zation of medical groups and local con-
tracting practices and the rate at which
these factors are changing.30,31 Findings
from recent site visits, however, do sug-
gestsomepossibleexplanationsforsome
of the more dramatic changes between
1999-2001. For example, in Syracuse,
NY, which experienced a significant in-
creaseindissatisfaction,increasedhealth
plans leverage that resulted from the
mergerofthe2largesthealthplansinthe
market might have had deleterious ef-
fects on physician payment and au-
tonomy. In contrast, in Newark, NJ,
which experienced a significant decline
in dissatisfaction, the state moved ag-
gressively to adopt new more stringent
oversight of HMOs and to mandate
prompt payment requirements follow-
ing the high-profile collapses of 2 health
plans in 1998.32-34
Our data are subject to several limi-
tations. First, we used only a single mea-
sure of general satisfaction. Our mea-
sure, however, is robust and similar

questions have been used in numer-
ous other studies in the past. Second,
while to our knowledge our sample is
the largest nationally representative lon-
gitudinal study of physicians, the
sample sizes for many individual mar-
kets were relatively small. Conse-
quently, with the exception of the 12
high-intensity sites, we were unable to
make precise estimates of changes at the
individual market level and lacked sta-
tistical power to identify actionable in-
fluences. This is, however, the first
study to document these important dif-
ferences across markets and this area
should be a high priority for future re-
search.
In summary, our data suggest that de-
clining physician career satisfaction is
real but variable in both time and space.
Physician satisfaction seems to have de-
clined from 1997 to 1999, but not ap-
preciably between 1999 and 2001.
However, this was not true for all mar-
kets. Constraints on physicians' clini-
cal autonomy seem to have been the
most important influences on changes
in career satisfaction among physi-
cians, but other factors, such as in-
creases in hours worked and changes
in practice ownership status, have also
played a role. Future research needs to
explore the determinants of physician
satisfaction in different markets and
should highlight local interventions that
might be pursued to maintain or im-
prove physician satisfaction.
