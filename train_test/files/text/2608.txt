This double-blind study determined the influence of serum neutralizing antibody titers on the
rate of infection and magnitude of disease expression after experimental exposure of adult volunteers
to rhinovirus strain Hanks (RV-H). A total of 133 healthy volunteers were tested for antibody status,
cloistered for a 6-day period, and challenged with RV-H at the end of the first cloister day. On
these days, response to viral challenge is assessed with symptom diaries and physical examinations.
The low-titer infected group was significantly different from the intermediate-titer infected and the
uninfected groups in terms of postchallenge nasal and throat symptoms, expelled secretion weights,
nasal mucociliary clearance rates, and frequency of negative middle ear pressures. A similar trend
held for the infected high-titer vs. low-titer group comparisons. These data show that high homotypic
serum neutralizing antibody titers are associated with protection from infection and lessened signs
