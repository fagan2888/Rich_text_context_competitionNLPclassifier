Introduction
Accurate clinical assessment of pain in cats is challeng
ing. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of chronic
pain and develops with ageing in this species.1 Diagnosis
is complicated by the fact that lameness is not a common
feature,1 and early cartilaginous lesions may develop
without concurrent osteophytosis, which can lead to a
mismatch between radiographic lesions, orthopaedic
examination findings and clinical signs.2 This is com
pounded by the lack of validated pain assessment and
screening tools in cats,3 which increases the difficulty in
identifying those affected by the chronic pain associated
with OA. In a clinical setting pain assessment of cats
usually involves veterinary clinical examination, radio
graphy and discussion with the owner regarding the
cat's mobility and behaviour.
The severity of radiographic lesions does not correlate
with the severity of pain experienced by humans with
symptomatic OA.4 Central sensitisation, which occurs in
OA, has been suggested as the explanation for this incon
sistency.5 In chronic painful states like OA, central sensi
tisation is due to the sustained activity of nociceptors,
Repeatability of quantitative sensory

Abstract
Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the repeatability of quantitative sensory tests (QSTs) in a group of
healthy untrained cats (n = 14) and to compare the results with those from cats with osteoarthritis (n = 7).
Methods Peak vertical force (PVF) and vertical impulse were measured on a pressure plate system. Thermal
sensitivity was assessed using a temperature-controlled plate at 7°C and 40°C. Individual paw lifts and overall
duration of paw lifts were counted and measured for each limb. Paw withdrawal thresholds were measured using
manual and electronic von Frey monofilaments (MVF and EVF, respectively) applied to the metacarpal or metatarsal
pads. All measurements were repeated twice to assess repeatability of the tests.
Results In healthy cats all tests were moderately repeatable. When compared with cats with osteoarthritis the PVF
was significantly higher in healthy hindlimbs in repeat 1 but not in repeat 2. Cats with osteoarthritis of the forelimbs
showed a decrease in the frequency of paw lifts on the 7°C plate compared with cats with healthy forelimbs, and
the duration of paw lifts was significantly less than healthy forelimbs in the first repeat but not in the second repeat.
Osteoarthritic limbs had significantly lower paw withdrawal thresholds with both MVF and EVF than healthy limbs.
Conclusions and relevance QSTs are moderately repeatable in untrained cats. Kinetic gait analysis did not permit
differentiation between healthy limbs and those with osteoarthritis, but thermal sensitivity testing (cold) does.
Sensory threshold testing can differentiate osteoarthritic and healthy limbs, and may be useful in the diagnosis and
monitoring of this condition in cats in the clinical setting.

leading to an increase in the excitability of neurons within
the central nervous system. This activity-dependent syn
aptic plasticity leads to increases in synapse efficacy and
reductions in inhibition, causing somatosensory abnor
malities such as allodynia, hyperalgesia or thermal
hypersensitivity at local and remote sites from the
affected joint.6 Central sensitisation therefore has impor
tant implications for the diagnosis and effective treat
ment of pain.
Somatosensory abnormalities can be assessed using
quantitative sensory tests (QSTs). QSTs involve the
application of mechanical, thermal or electrical stimuli
to an area to assess sensory and/or pain pathways.7 Two
studies have evaluated these in dogs demonstrating
increased sensory sensitivity in those with OA,8,9 which
is likely to reflect the presence of central sensitisation.
Increased sensory sensitivity with a reduction in paw
withdrawal threshold has also been identified in cats
with OA using a von Frey anaesthesiometer.10,11 In these
studies cats were trained for gait analysis across a pres
sure plate system and they were partially restrained in a
mesh cage for paw withdrawal threshold assessment.
Clinical application of QSTs has the potential to aid
diagnosis of OA in cats and to help evaluate the efficacy
of treatment. Experimental studies have demonstrated
good repeatability of these tests in an experimental set
ting,10 but, to our knowledge, no studies have evaluated
the application of QSTs to untrained cats in a clinical
setting.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the repeat
ability of QSTs in a clinical setting in healthy untrained
cats and to further investigate the somatosensory abnor
malities that are present in cats with OA to assess clinical
utility in aiding diagnosis of this condition. It was
hypothesised that QSTs would be repeatable in untrained
cats and that cats with OA would demonstrate lower
paw withdrawal thresholds and cold hypersensitivity,
similar to findings in dogs.
Materials and methods
The study design was approved by the University of
Edinburgh Veterinary Ethical Review Committee
(Reference 14/12). Prior to a cat's enrolment in the study,
all assessments were explained in detail to the owner
and written consent was obtained. All tests were readily
escapable.
Phenotyping
Cats were recruited from February 2013 to November
2014. All owners completed a questionnaire (see supple
mentary material) assessing mobility, activity levels,
grooming habits and temperament.Activities were scored
from 0 to 4 (0 = no problem completing the activity; 1 = a
little problematic; 2 = quite problematic; 3 = severely
problematic; 4 = impossible). The presence of lameness or
resentment to being handled was scored as 0 if negative
and 1 if positive. The owner was asked if the cat sought
seclusion, which was scored as 0 if they never sought
seclusion; 1 if rarely; 2 if occasionally; 3 if often; and 4 if all
the time. The owner was also asked regarding the cat
seeking interaction with family members and was scored
as 0 if interaction occurred all the time; 1 if it occurred
often; 2 if it occurred occasionally; 3 if it occurred rarely;
and 4 if it never occurred.
All cats underwent a full physical and orthopaedic
examination by both authors to assess for any orthopae
dic or neurological disease. Painful joints were identified
and noted for each cat if present.
Medical records and radiographic/CT images were
reviewed in cats with painful joints to assess for the pres
ence of OA and response to analgesia.
Cats were placed into the `healthy' group if there was
no evidence of activity/mobility impairment from the
questionnaire and were deemed to be in good general
health following veterinary examination. Cats were
placed into the `OA' group if there was clear activity/
mobility impairment from the questionnaire, consistent
joint pain on examination, evidence of OA in those joints
on radiographic examination or CT scan and/or positive
improvement in mobility with a course of meloxicam. In
those cats treated with meloxicam this medication was
stopped 48 h prior to testing. As the half-life is 24 h,12
therapeutic concentrations should not have been pre
sent. No cats received opioid analgesia.
Kinetic gait analysis
A Tekscan pressure walkway consisting of two sensing
tiles connected together to form a single low-profile 1 m
× 0.5 m pressure walkway containing 1.4 sensels per cm2
was used. Two `Tekscan EH-2 Evolution' handles were
used to connect the walkway to a laptop computer,
allowing kinetic data to be analysed using proprietary
software (Walkway v7.02; Tekscan). The walkway was
calibrated as the per manufacturer's guidelines, and a
proprietary equilibration file (20 PSI) was used when
gathering data. The data were collected in a quiet room
with two cardboard boards on either side of the long
edge of the walkway, with exits at the front and back of
the walkway. The cats were encouraged to walk across
with positive reinforcement with food, toys or the pres
ence of their bed, basket or owner. The cats walked
across the walkway at their own (self-governed) speed.
This was repeated until five valid trials were obtained.
Trials were excluded if the cat ran, trotted, paused,
stopped or turned its head on the walkway. Only trials
with a velocity in the central 50% of the cat's comfortable
speed were used. The peak vertical force (PVF), vertical
impulse (VI) and velocity were calculated. PVF and VI
were expressed as a percent of body weight. Symmetry
indices were calculated using the following formula:13
1276 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery 19(12)

where SI stands for symmetry index, and PVF1
was the
higher value and PVF2
was the lower value. A SI of 0
indicated perfect symmetry. A second SI was also used,
which has been used in a previous study with kinetic
gait analysis in cats:14
SI = PVF /PVF

With this index a SI of 1 indicated perfect symmetry.
Cut-off values used to differentiate between lame and
normal dogs were evaluated to assess utility in cats,
which were as follows:13

Thermal sensitivity
The custom-designed thermal platform was manufac
tured in-house to provide a level 1000 mm × 500 mm ×
15 mm aluminium platform, which could be controlled
at 7ºC (cold plate) or 40ºC (hot plate) (Figure 1). The cool
ing and heating was achieved using Peltier elements
with the `back' surface of the elements being maintained
at room temperature with computer processor coolers.
The platform contained 18 Peltier elements and associ
ated processor coolers, which were arranged in six rows
of three each. Twenty-one calibrated temperature sen
sors were mounted in the platform and the temperature
readings from the six sensors surrounding each group of
three Peltier elements were used to stabilise the tempera
ture in that area of the platform. The Peltier elements
were driven by six reversible switching drivers and pro
portional control was provided by pulse width modula
tion of the drive signals and the choice of cooling or
heating for each channel. The whole system was con
trolled by a PIC microcontroller, which acquired and

displayed the temperature measurements at each tem
perature sensor. The surface temperature was confirmed
on the top of the platform at multiple random points
prior to use with a digital thermometer.
Cats were placed onto the plate at each temperature
and after 10 s of habituation the number of times and
duration that each paw was lifted clear of the plate sur
face was recorded over 80 s. The plate was escapable (by
walking off) in all directions at all times. A period of at
least 5 mins with rest on a surface at room temperature
occurred between testing at each temperature.
Paw withdrawal threshold
Paw withdrawal threshold was assessed with von Frey
monofilaments. In the first test manual von Frey mono
filaments (MVF) were used (Touch Test Sensory
Evaluators; North Coast Medical & Rehabilitation
Products) (Figure 2). The filament was applied to the
palmar or plantar aspect of the metacarpal or metatarsal
pad, respectively, when the cat was standing with mini
mal manual restraint. A negative response was no paw
withdrawal with buckling of the filament. A positive
response was the cat withdrawing its paw prior to the
filament buckling. The threshold sensitivity (measured
in grams) was defined as the filament that induced a
paw withdrawal at least three times in six repeated
measurements.
In the second test an electronic von Frey device (EVF)
was used (Model 2391; IITC Life Science) (Figure 3). This
had a rigid probe (0.8 mm diameter tip) on a hand-held
force transducer (800 g internal load cell) with a thresh
old monitoring anaesthesiometer, which gave readings
in grams. The probe was applied to the same area as
described above. The force of the probe was steadily
increased until paw withdrawal was elicited or the maxi
mum value of 400 g was reached. This was repeated
three times and the average of the three readings was
used in the analysis.
Repeatability
All tests were repeated on a second separate occasion
(minimum of 2 h between tests) to evaluate repeatability.

controlled at 7ºC (cold plate) or 40ºC (hot plate)

Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using three types of statis
tical software (Microsoft Excel 2010; Minitab 17; MedCalc
version 16.4.3).
All data were analysed to assess if they were paramet
ric or non-parametric. Left vs right limbs were evaluated
in the healthy group, using the Mann­Whitney U-test or
the paired Student's t-test (for non-parametric and para
metric data, respectively). Repeatability was assessed in
the healthy group using the Wilcoxon-signed rank test or
paired Student's t-test (for non-parametric and paramet
ric data, respectively) to evaluate for differences between
the first and second repeat. Bland­Altman plots were
then performed for each test.
The overall score for the questionnaire was assessed
between healthy cats and those with arthritis. A Mann­
Whitney U-test was performed to evaluate the difference
in score. Each score for each activity was then assessed
between the two groups using Fisher's Exact Test.
As the cats in the OA group had different joints
affected, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate
differences between healthy limbs and those limbs
affected by OA. Differences between limbs were assessed
using the Mann­Whitney U-test or the two-sample
Student's t-test (for non-parametric and parametric data,
respectively). A Bonferroni correction was applied to
correct for multiple comparisons.
Results
Phenotyping
In total, 23 cats were recruited for the study, with 16 cats
placed in the healthy group and seven in the OA group.
Two cats in the healthy group were excluded as they
both had a painful left elbow joint on orthopaedic exami
nation, leaving 14 cats in total in this group.
The median score of the questionnaire of healthy cats
was 2 and that of the OA cats was 14. The questionnaire
score was significantly higher for the OA group (P =
0.0030). On individual activity assessment, walking (P =
0.0001), running (P = 0.0010) and jumping (P = 0.0001)
scored significantly higher in the OA group compared
with the healthy group.
Five cats in the OA group were being treated with
meloxicam, which was stopped 48 h prior to testing. One
cat in this group also had inflammatory bowel disease,
which was well controlled on low-dose prednisolone (1
mg [0.27 mg/kg] orally q24h). This cat developed vomit
ing if the prednisolone was stopped; therefore, treatment
was continued during testing.Another cat in the OAgroup
had been diagnosed with alimentary small-cell lym
phoma, which was treated with dexamethasone (0.16 mg/
kg subcutaneously every 2 weeks). Testing was performed
at the end of the 2 week period, prior to a repeat dexa
methasone injection. Neither of these two cats had any
abdominal discomfort on examination prior to testing. All
cats in the OA group had radiographic (n = 2) or CT (n =
4) evidence of OAin the painful joint except one cat, which
had painful joints and a significant improvement in mobil
ity with treatment with meloxicam (the owner had
declined imaging). Joints affected included the hip joint
(bilateral; two cats); the stifle joint (unilateral; two cats); the
shoulder joint (unilateral one cat; bilateral one cat) and the
elbow joint (unilateral one cat; bilateral one cat).
Signalment
In total, 11 cats were male (seven healthy; four with OA)
and 10 were female (seven healthy; three with OA).
Twenty cats were neutered (14 healthy; six with OA) and
one cat with OA was entire. Thirteen cats were domestic
short- or longhair (11 healthy; two with OA) and eight
cats were represented by the following breeds: British
Shorthair (two healthy); Birman (one healthy); Bengal
(one with OA); Maine Coon (three with OA) and Persian
(two with OA). There was no significant difference in sex,
breed or neuter status between healthy and OA groups.
The median age of the healthy group was 7 years and
1 month, and that of the OA group was 12 years. Cats in
the OA group were significantly older than those in the
healthy group (P = 0.0394).
Repeat testing
The second repeat of the tests was performed on the
same day for all cats, except for six who were not

probe on a hand-held force transducer with a threshold
monitoring anaesthesiometer

available for same-day testing. A gap of at least 2 h was
left between repeat testing performed on the same day.
Three healthy cats had the second repeat tests performed
4, 6 and 26 weeks after the first session. Three OA cats
had the second repeat tests performed 15 weeks after the
first session. One cat with OA was not available for sec
ond repeat tests.
Tests in healthy cats
Table 1 summarises mean/median values and confidence
intervals (CIs) for each test. In the kinetic gait analysis the
median velocity was 65 cm/s (range 14.2­112.8
cm/s).
Hindlimbs bore 80.92% of the weight of the forelimbs in
the first repeat and 79.25% of the weight in the second
repeat, consistent with previous reports.15 The PVF and
VI were significantly higher for the forelimbs than the
hindlimbs (PVF: P <0.0001 repeat 1; P = 0.0007 repeat 2;
VI: P = 0.0248 repeat 1; P = 0.0156 repeat 2).
Table 2 summarises the symmetry index results for
the PVF of the forelimbs and hindlimbs in healthy cats.
Using the cut-off values for lameness one healthy cat
was falsely classed as forelimb lame in repeat 1 and

another healthy cat was falsely classed as hindlimb lame
in repeat 2. This was identified in the same cats for both
symmetry indices. The duration of time to obtain five
valid trials varied with the individual cat. For repeat 1
the median time was 12 mins (range 6­22 mins), and for
repeat 2 the median time was 15 mins (range 6­55 mins).
The frequency of paw lifts on the cold and hot plates
were significantly higher in the forelimbs than the
hindlimbs in repeat 2 (cold: P = 0.0074; hot: P = 0.0029)
but not in repeat 1 (cold: P = 0.0767; hot: P = 0.0795). The
duration of the paw lifts for both plates were signifi
cantly higher for the forelimbs than the hindlimbs in
both repeats (cold: P = 0.0036 repeat 1; P = 0.0009 repeat
2; hot: P = 0.0123 repeat 1; P = 0.0001 repeat 2). There
was no significant difference between paw withdrawal
threshold sensitivity between forelimbs and hindlimbs.
There was no significant difference between left and
right forelimbs or hindlimbs in any test.
Repeatability
There was no difference in the mean or median value
between repeat 1 and repeat 2 of any test. Bland-Altman
plots demonstrated moderate repeatability of all tests
(see Figure 4 and supplementary material); however,
there were large limits of agreement for all tests owing to
individual variability between repeats. The largest vari
ability was present for the MVF and EVF.
Healthy vs OA limbs
See Table 1 for mean/median values and CIs for each
test. Table 3 contains the P values for each test. In
hindlimbs with OA, PVF was significantly lower than
healthy hindlimbs in repeat 1 (P = 0.0017) but not in
repeat 2. There was no significant difference in the PVF
between healthy and OAforelimbs. There was no signifi
cant difference in the VI between healthy and OA fore
limbs or hindlimbs. Table 4 summarises the symmetry
index results for the PVF of the forelimbs and hindlimbs
in OA cats. Using the cut-off values for lameness identi
fied in the healthy cat group, one cat with right shoulder
joint OA and one cat with right stifle joint OA were iden
tified as lame in repeat 1. In repeat 2 one cat with bilat
eral shoulder joint OA (worse on the left side) was
identified as lame and the cat with right stifle joint OA
was again identified as lame. Of the four bilaterally
affected cats only one cat was identified as lame in one
repeat using both symmetry indices. Of the three unilat
erally affected cats, two cats were identified as lame
using both symmetry indices. The duration of time to

obtain five valid trials varied with the individual cat,
similarly with the healthy cats. For repeat 1 the median
time was 7 mins (range 3­17 mins) and for repeat 2 the
median time was 9 mins (range 5­13 mins). There was no
significant difference in the length of time to obtain five
valid trials between healthy and osteoarthritic cats.
On the cold plate in forelimbs with OA the frequency
of paw lifts was significantly less than healthy forelimbs
(P = 0.0021 repeat 1; P = 0.0107 repeat 2). The duration
of paw lifts was significantly less than healthy forelimbs
in the first repeat (P = 0.0025) but not in the second
repeat. There was no significant difference in either the
frequency or duration of paw lifts between healthy and
OA hindlimbs on the cold plate. There was no significant
difference between healthy and OA forelimbs or
hindlimbs in the frequency or duration of paw lifts on
the hot plate.
OA limbs had significantly lower paw withdrawal
thresholds with both MVF and EVF than healthy limbs
(MVF: P <0.0001 repeat 1, P = 0.0016 repeat 2; EVF: P =
0.0150 repeat 1, P <0.0001 repeat 2). An arbitrary thresh
old of 150 g for EVF paw withdrawal gave a sensitivity
of 0.82 (repeat 1) and 0.67 (repeat 2); and a specificity of
0.81 (repeat 1) and 0.89 (repeat 2) for discriminating OA
vs healthy limbs.
Discussion
This study investigated the clinical utility of kinetic gait
analysis, thermal sensitivity testing with a temperature
plate and paw withdrawal testing with two types of von
Frey monofilaments in healthy, untrained cats. All tests
were shown to be moderately repeatable; however, there
was an element of individual variability for all tests,
which was particularly notable when using the von Frey
monofilaments.
The particular tests used in this study were evaluated
because they have been shown to discriminate OA in
limbs in dogs.8 Ethical approval was obtained prior to
commencement of the study. With respect to the thermal
sensitivity testing, hot and cold temperature thresholds
were chosen that would not cause pain or injury. Aprevi
ous study has demonstrated that the noxious heat stimu
lus in cats is >43°C; therefore, a temperature below this
threshold was chosen.16 Literature regarding cold pain
thresholds is limited. Nociceptors responsive to cold
temperatures in cat skin start to discharge between 15ºC
and 20°C, with higher rates of discharge 5°C.17 The sec
ond threshold with a temperature of 7°C, although cold,
is warmer than ground temperature during the winter,
which many cats would be exposed to when roaming
outdoors. Overall safety of exposure to certain tempera
tures is not only reliant on the temperature alone, but is
also a function of the duration of exposure. Thermal test
ing in this study was therefore designed to be of short
duration and easily escapable. All cats were closely mon
itored and no adverse behaviour or discomfort was
identified for any cat during testing.
Kinetic gait analysis has been used in several previous
studies in cats;10,11,14,15 however, cats have either been
acclimatised for at least 30 mins in the room with the
pressure plate or trained to walk across it with or without
a leash. In this study cats were completely naïve to the
pressure plate with no level of training. Although our
analysis found the results repeatable it was a very time
consuming test in some cats in order to obtain five valid
trials. Some cats were easily motivated by the positive
reinforcement; however, in other cats the positive rein
forcement was much less effective and it took nearly an
hour to get five trials. Therefore, in some cats this may be
a challenging test to perform in a clinical scenario owing
to the variable response to positive reinforcement.
The symmetry index, which is regularly used in dogs,
seems to be less useful in the cat. Two healthy cats were
classed as lame when this index was applied. SI2
was
used for comparative purposes as it has been assessed in
normal cats in a previous study.14 They identified a mean
SI on 0.97 with a SD of 0.02 for both forelimbs and
hindlimbs. In our study the mean SIs and SDs were more
variable. Without leash training the cats may not be
walking `perfectly' across the plate. Very slight changes
in speed or the cat looking around the room without an
obvious head turn could lead to the increased variability
seen, which on two occasions was enough for the healthy
cats to be classed as `lame', using this approach.
In contrast to dogs, which have been shown to have
cold hypersensitivity with stifle OA,8 we found some
evidence of cold hyposensitivity in cats in forelimbs with
OA. Increased sensory sensitivity is not always reported

with central sensitisation in humans; indeed, tactile and
thermal hyposensitivity have been reported with knee
OA alongside pressure hyperalgesia in the same areas.5
The reason for this has been suggested to be a result of
the descending inhibitory systems, which may become
activated to counteract the enhanced excitation of
peripheral afferents to noxious stimuli. Therefore, the
sensitivity of afferents to innocuous stimuli may also be
reduced.5
The cold hyposensitivity was only identified in the
forelimbs in this study. The reason for this could be due
to the methodology. If the cats wanted to move on the
temperature plate they often moved their forelimbs and
pivoted on their hindlimbs. This is likely to be the reason
for the increased frequency and duration of paw lifts
observed in the forelimbs in comparison with the
hindlimbs. Therefore, with this test it would be more
challenging to pick up differences in thermal sensitivity
in the hindlimbs. Alternatively, another interpretation
could be that cats with OA are less mobile and more
reluctant to move around. However, this is not the case
identified with similar methodology in dogs with OA
and in the kinetic gait analysis there was no significant
difference in the velocity of cats with OA in comparison
to healthy cats. Although placing cats on the tempera
ture plate is a quick and easy test, its clinical utility may
be relatively limited given that it was only discrimina
tory for cats with forelimb lameness.
Increased sensory sensitivity with a lower paw with
drawal threshold, as measured using von Frey monofila
ments, allowed consistent differentiation between OA
and healthy limbs. This was a relatively quick and easy
test to perform using both electronic and manual tech
niques. They also allow for quantification of pain by
identification of allodynia, which has important implica
tions for analgesia treatment. Paw withdrawal thresh
olds in cats consistent with allodynia have been reported
to be 40 g for the forelimbs and 50 g for the hindlimbs.10,11
In our study, however, there was no significant differ
ence in paw withdrawal threshold between forelimbs
and hindlimbs. Applying these thresholds to our EVF
dataset revealed that no healthy cats had allodynia,
whereas 33% of OA cats in repeat 1 and 45% of OA cats
in repeat 2 had thresholds suggestive of allodynia. In
comparing MVF with EVF we felt that the EVF was
superior owing to its continuous data measurement, the
fact that allodynia was incorrectly identified in some
healthy cats with MVF and the much shorter time it took
to perform the EVF test.
This study has several limitations. The sample size is
small; therefore, type II errors may have occurred. There
was also no imaging of the healthy cats prior to enrol
ment into the study. This was not performed as there
was no clinical justification to do so for the benefit of
these cats, which were perceived to be healthy. In
addition, owing to the mismatch between radiographic
signs and macroscopic lesions,2 negative radiographic
findings would not have definitively ruled out the pres
ence of OA in these cats. The OA group itself was very
heterogeneous, with different joints affected and some
cats being either bilaterally or unilaterally affected. The
majority of cases of OA in cats are primary and related to
ageing; therefore, a more homogeneous group would be
very challenging to obtain. There were also differences
in time between the first and second repeats as not all
cats were available for same-day testing. Although the
latter two points are valid limitations, the purpose of the
study was to evaluate the use of these tests in a clinical
setting, and this more closely approximates what can be
achieved clinically. Finally, two cats in the OA group had
other medical conditions ­ one had inflammatory bowel
disease and the other had alimentary small-cell lym
phoma. Both cats had good long-term control of the con
ditions with low-dose steroids and showed no pain on
abdominal palpation. As the conditions were not per
ceived to be causing chronic pain it is unlikely that they
would be causing central sensitisation in these cats in
comparison to the joints with OA, where obvious pain
was identified on clinical examination.
Conclusions
All QSTs were found to be moderately repeatable in
healthy, untrained cats. Kinetic gait analysis did not per
mit differentiation between osteoarthritic and healthy
limbs, and had relatively limited clinical utility for diag
nosis of this condition. In contrast to findings in dogs,
cats demonstrate some evidence of cold hyposensitivity
with OA. Paw withdrawal threshold measured using
von Frey monofilaments allowed consistent differentia
tion between osteoarthritic and healthy limbs, and may
aid diagnosis of this condition in combination with clini
cal examination and a history of impaired mobility.
