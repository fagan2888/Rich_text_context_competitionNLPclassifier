Abstract
Objective: To investigate whether levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), as a measure of
endothelial dysfunction, are higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with healthy
control subjects. The relationships between ADMA and surrogate measures of arterial stiffness
were evaluated.
Methods: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy control subjects were recruited.
ADMA was quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Arterial stiffness was evaluated
using pulse wave analysis.
Results: There was no significant difference in plasma ADMA concentration between patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (n ¼ 30) and healthy controls (n ¼ 30). Aortic augmentation pressure
was significantly higher in patients than in controls. C-reactive protein and Health Assessment
Questionnaire score were independent predictors of arterial stiffness in patients. There was no
relationship between ADMA concentration and aortic augmentation pressure in the study
population as a whole.
Conclusions: Arterial stiffness appears to be increased in rheumatoid arthritis and independently
associated with systemic inflammation and physical disability. ADMA concentration was not
increased in this small group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with healthy controls;
nor was it associated with arterial stiffness.

Introduction
Arterial stiffness is influenced by endothelial
dysfunction in both healthy individuals
and patients with cardiovascular disease.1,2
Little is known regarding the prevalence
of endothelial dysfunction and its relationship
with arterial stiffness in patients with rheuma-
toid arthritis. The aim of the present study was
to investigate whether levels of asymmetric
dimethylarginine (ADMA), as a measure of
endothelial dysfunction,3 are higher in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared
with healthy control subjects. In addition,
the relationships between ADMA and surro-
gate measures of arterial stiffness were
evaluated.
Patients and methods
Study population
Consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis
who met the criteria of the American College of
Rheumatology4 and had no history of cardio-
vascular events were enrolled from the out-
patient clinic of the Rheumatology Unit,
Department of Clinical and Experimental
Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria
of Sassari and University of Sassari, Sassari,
Italy, between January and May 2007.
Collected data included: presence of conven-
tional cardiovascular risk factors; treatment
with aspirin, or antihypertensive or cholesterol-
lowering drugs; duration of rheumatoid
arthritis; steroid treatment; type and dosage
of antitumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a
inhibitor treatment; C-reactive protein (CRP)
concentration; erythrocyte sedimentation rate;
immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factor; antic-
yclic citrullinated peptide; Disease Activity
Score (DAS);5 Ritchie Index;6 and Health
Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ).7
Control subjects strictly matched for con-
ventional cardiovascular risk factors (using
echo colour Doppler carotid ultrasound),
who were attending routine check-ups at the
outpatient clinic of the Cardiology Unit,
Department of Clinical and Experimental
Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria
of Sassari and University of Sassari, were also
enrolled. The protocol was approved by the
ethics committee of the University of Sassari
and all participants provided written informed
consent prior to enrolment.
Study parameters
Whole blood was collected into sterile
tubes containing ethylenediaminetetra-acetic
acid (EDTA)-potassium, then centrifuged in
a Jouan centrifuge at 1000g for 10min, and the
resulting plasma was stored at À20C until
analysis. Plasma ADMA was quantified
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA; DLD Diagnostika GmbH,
Hamburg, Germany), according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. Arterial stiffness was
evaluated by pulse wave analysis as
described,8 using a high-fidelity hand-held
tonometry probe (Millar pressure tonometer,
PWV Medical, Sydney, Australia). Registered
radial pulse waveforms were recorded using a
computer-based pulse wave analysis system
(SphygmoCorÕ, PWV Medical, Sydney,
Australia).
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or n (%)
of participants. Between-group compari-
sons were made using Student's t-test,
Kolmogorov­Smirnov test or 2-test, as
appropriate. Bivariate relationships were
Erre et al. 77
analysed using nonparametric Spearman's
test. A two-sided P-value 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. Data were
analysed using SPSSÕ version 11.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ.
Results
The study included 30 patients with rheuma-
toid arthritis (two male/28 female; mean age
55.0Æ 12.7 years) and 30 healthy control sub-
jects (two male/28 female; mean age 54.1Æ 13.2
years). Demographic and clinical characteris-
tics of the study population are shown in Table
1. There were no significant between-group
differences in cardiovascular risk factors.
Significantly more control subjects than
patients were taking aspirin (P¼ 0.04).
Data regarding ADMA and arterial
stiffness parameters are shown in Table 2.

There was no significant between-group
difference in plasma ADMA concentration.
Aortic augmentation pressure was signifi-
cantly higher in patients than control sub-
jects (P ¼ 0.02; Table 2).
Bivariate analysis of the study population
as a whole found significant associations
between plasma ADMA concentration and
age (P ¼ 0.002) and aortic augmentation
pressure (P ¼ 0.015). Bivariate analysis of
the patient group showed significant associ-
ations between ADMA concentration and
cumulative steroid dose (P ¼ 0.025), Ritchie
Index (P ¼ 0.018) and DAS (P ¼ 0.025), and
significant associations between aortic aug-
mentation pressure and age (P ¼ 0.013),
CRP concentration (P ¼ 0.0001) and HAQ
score (P ¼ 0.004). Multiple linear regression
analysis found that CRP concentration and
HAQ score alone were independently asso-
ciated with aortic augmentation pressure in
the patient group (P ¼ 0.0001).
Discussion
Plasma ADMA concentrations were not
elevated in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis compared with control subjects in
the present study. This is in contrast to the
findings of other studies, which have reported
significantly higher ADMA concentrations in
treatment-nai¨ve patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, compared with controls.9 A small
prospective study found a significant reduc-
tion in ADMA concentrations after 3
months' anti-TNF-a treatment.10 It is there-
fore possible that the absence of a significant
between-group difference in ADMA concen-
tration in the present study may be a result of
long-term treatment with anti-TNF-a drugs
in our patient group. It should be noted that,
as the range of biological variation of ADMA
is extremely narrow both in health and
disease,11 the sample sizes of our study and
other studies might be too small to draw firm
conclusions regarding ADMA concentrations

in rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, hetero-
geneity in ADMA quantification methods
and in enrolled patient populations may
further explain these apparently contradict-
ory results.
Arterial stiffness is related to systemic
inflammation and is elevated in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis compared with healthy
controls.12 There was a statistically signifi-
cant increase in arterial stiffness in patients
compared with controls in the present study.
In addition, the inflammatory marker CRP
was a major predictor of arterial stiffness in
our patient group. We found no relationship
between ADMA concentration and aortic
augmentation pressure (as a measure of
arterial stiffness) in either the study popula-
tion as a whole or in the patient group alone.
This may be due to the small sample size of
our study.
In conclusion, arterial stiffness appears to
be increased in rheumatoid arthritis and is
independently associated with systemic
inflammation and physical disability.
ADMA concentration was not increased in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis; nor was
it associated with arterial stiffness.
