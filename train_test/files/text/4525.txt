Introduction
It has been nearly 2years since completing my thesis, per-
haps a necessary period of time to detach from the experi-
ence of employing auto-ethnography on victimisation. In a
study examining the experiences of veiled Muslim women
as victims of Islamophobia, I was both a researcher and a
participant. Specifically, in addition to individual and focus
group interviews with Muslim women who wear the niqab
(face veil), I employed auto-ethnography whereby I wore
the niqab in public spaces at the suggestion of some of my
respondents. Wearing the veil myself was something I
decided to do after my pilot interviews, when some of my
respondents suggested that doing so would enable me to
`see the world through their eyes'. Indeed, being an Orthodox
Christian female researcher meant that I was perceived as an
outsider by my participants; however, wearing the niqab
allowed me to gain insider knowledge (Keval, 2009). The
aim of this added layer of auto-ethnography was to identify
the role of the `visibility' of the Muslim identity in trigger-
ing Islamophobic hostility in public spaces. As such, I used
my experiences, together with those of my participants, to
complement the main research methods of interviews and
focus groups. Using auto-ethnography allowed for my expe-
riences to play a valid role in the study because the method
includes the researcher as a participant (Smith, 2005).
Within the framework of grounded theory (Glaser and
Strauss, 1967), this approach led to the co-creation of
knowledge by the participants and myself.
Auto-ethnography can be understood as the ethnographic
exploration of the `self' (Ferrell, 2012: 218). It is a research
method that uses self-observation and reflexive investigation
for the purposes of extending sociological understanding
(Sparkes, 2000). However, as Wakeman (2014) points out,
`most criminologists do not like to talk about themselves and

auto-ethnography: Wearing the
Muslim veil in public

Abstract
This article reflects upon my personal experiences of undertaking auto-ethnography on victimisation through wearing the
Muslim veil in public. Wearing the veil was suggested by some of my respondents as a way to get insider knowledge of their
own day-to-day experiences of victimisation. Here, I explore the emotional, psychological and physical impacts of being targeted
because of my (perceived/adopted) Muslim identity. I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of covert auto-ethnographic
research and consider the ethical challenges and practical difficulties of performing auto-ethnography. Also, I discuss the
theoretical and methodological issues that arise from undertaking auto-ethnography as an insider/outsider when researching
the targeted victimisation of veiled Muslim women. Finally, I discuss the usefulness and limitations of auto-ethnography as a
method for understanding victimisation. I conclude that auto-ethnographic research into victimisation has great potential,
although researchers need to be aware of some risks inherent in this approach and, thus, proceed with caution.

their feelings very much'(p. 705). In auto-ethnography, there
is a considerable emphasis on personal recollections, the
evocation of feelings and the exploration of characters. This
means that the resulting accounts of auto-ethnography can be
highly charged for the author and reader alike (Atkinson,
2015). Despite recent accounts of the role of emotion in
criminology and in research (Ferrell, 2006; Jewkes, 2011;
Liebling, 1999; Phillips and Earle, 2010), accounts of the
self are usually absent. This has often been attributed to the
ways in which the discipline is structured ­ requiring
researchers to minimise their selves, `viewing self as a con-
taminant and attempting to transcend and deny it' (Wall,
2006: 147).
From a positivist perspective, the researcher ensures
objectivity in the research process by denying their identity.
However, the postmodern era has made it possible for inno-
vative research strategies such as auto-ethnography to
emerge (Mannay and Morgan, 2015). Founded on postmod-
ern ideas, auto-ethnography questions the dominant scien-
tific paradigm and makes room for other ways of knowing
through sharing unique, subjective and evocative stories of
experience that contribute to our understanding of the social
world and allow us to reflect on what could be different
because of what we have learned (Wall, 2006). However,
auto-ethnography is rarely used to understand victimisation.
There do exist some feminist auto-ethnographies of sexual
violence (see, for example, Hayes and Jeffries, 2015; Minge,
2007; Winkler and Hanke, 1995), but they do not entail pur-
poseful or tactical use of auto-ethnography, as is the case in
this study. To the best of the author's knowledge, purposeful
attempts to research victimisation using auto-ethnography
(or ethnography) are unheard of within criminology. (A note-
worthy exception from journalism is Ray Sprigle (1949) of
the Post-Gazette (newspaper in Pittsburgh, United States),
who posed as a black man to experience first-hand what life
was like for Black people living under the system of legal
segregation known as `Jim Crow'.)
Against this background, my study of auto-ethnography
on victimisation is extremely novel in criminological
research. In this article, I reflect upon my personal experi-
ences of utilising this method. First, I discuss the main tenets
of auto-ethnography, exploring how it was ideal for my
research at the same time as it presented challenges. Second,
I explore the emotional, psychological and physical impacts
of being targeted because of my adopted Muslim identity
through the wearing of the niqab. Third, I discuss the theo-
retical and methodological issues that arise from undertaking
auto-ethnography when researching the Islamophobic vic-
timisation of veiled Muslim women as an insider/outsider.
Fourth, I discuss the usefulness of auto-ethnography for
understanding victimisation. It will be concluded that while
researchers need to balance the risks presented by this
approach against the opportunities to generate appreciative
criminological data, auto-ethnographic research on victimi-
sation offers real potential as a criminological method.
Conceptualising auto-ethnography
Auto-ethnography is an emergent method although its ten-
ets stretch back over much ethnographical research (Taber,
2010). Hayano (1979) first coined the term in order to refer
to anthropological studies by individuals of their own cul-
ture. From this perspective, auto-ethnography was nar-
rowly defined as `insider ethnography'. More recently,
however, as Ellingson and Ellis (2008) note, `the meanings
and applications of autoethnography have evolved in a
manner that makes precise definition difficult' (p. 449).
Indeed, an exact definition of the concept of auto-ethnogra-
phy is rather elusive. Nevertheless, the consensus view is
that auto-ethnography relies on using and analysing the
researcher's own experiences. Specifically, auto-ethnography
can be seen to range from starting research from one's own
experience, to studies in which the researcher's experience
is explored alongside those of the participants, through to
examples in which the researcher's experiences of conduct-
ing the research become the actual focus of investigation
(Ellis and Bochner, 2000). Different approaches in auto-
ethnography can be characterised in terms of different rela-
tionships between the personal and the wider social world
that the writing seeks to enquire into (Denshire and Lee,
2013). These differences have been classified by Ellis and
Bochner (2006) in terms of `evocative' and `analytic'
approaches.
The evocative (also called `emotive') approach fore-
grounds the researcher's personal experiences and high-
lights the importance of storytelling in understanding
human experiences. In this respect, auto-ethnographers
tend to focus more on the self than on their social world
(Ellis and Bochner, 2000). Denzin (2006) and Ellis and
Bochner (2000, 2006) argue for an emotionally engaging
auto-ethnography, which is primarily concerned with the
researcher's subjective life experiences. In contrast, ana-
lytic auto-ethnography connects to `some broader set of
social phenomena than those provided by the data them-
selves' (Anderson, 2006: 387). The purpose of analytic
auto-ethnography is not simply to document personal expe-
riences and provide an insider's perspective; rather, its pur-
pose is to use empirical data in order to gain insight into
some broader set of social phenomena than those provided
by the data themselves. In the words of Wakeman (2014:
705), analytic auto-ethnography `is not so much a method
of self-investigation, but a technique of social investigation
conducted through the self'. In this regard, the goal is not
just to capture emotional and evocative content but rather
to develop a broad critical analysis of any given social phe-
nomenon through it. This binary classification is useful as
an initial way of making visible the variation in how auto-
ethnographic writers integrate the strands of self and cul-
ture in their writing (Denshire and Lee, 2013).
However, despite advances made in this field in recent
years, auto-ethnography has attracted stern critical attention
Zempi 3
from criminologists (Wakefield, 2014). Specifically, auto-
ethnography has been critiqued as a narcissistic preoccupa-
tion (Roth, 2009), lazy (Delamont, 2009) and antithetical to
career progression (Poulos, 2010). By using self as a source
of data, perhaps the only source, auto-ethnography has been
criticised for being self-indulgent, introspective and individ-
ualised (Atkinson, 1997; Sparkes, 2000). Atkinson (2015)
states that
the more we celebrate autoethnography, the greater the danger
that we treat ourselves as being more interesting than the social
worlds around us ... The social world is not a vehicle for our
emotional responses, or blank canvas onto which to project our
own anxieties and preoccupations. (p. 166)
Following this line of argument, Atkinson (2015: 166) states
that we must `keep autoethnographic writing in its place'.
Both Sparks (2002) and Jewkes (2011) recount the multiple
years that passed between the events their auto-ethnogra-
phies depict and their putting them to paper as indicative of
their trepidation to engage in such `self-absorption'. Crewe
(2009: 488) describes his reluctance to foreground himself in
his ethnography, `not because my identity was irrelevant to
the study, but because my identity was not what the study
was about'.
However, as Wakefield (2014) points out, auto-ethnography
­ especially analytic auto-ethnography ­ can provide a sound
epistemic platform upon which meaningful challenges to pre-
vailing theories of criminological subjects can be built.
Correspondingly, this study subscribes to the analytic approach,
using my personal experiences together with those of my par-
ticipants, as empirical data to gain insight into the targeted vic-
timisation of veiled Muslim women in public in the United
Kingdom.BeforereflectingonmyexperiencesofIslamophobic
victimisation while wearing the veil, I offer a brief overview of
the research study and describe the journey from merely using
interviews to undertaking auto-ethnography.
The research study
The study examined veiled Muslim women's experiences of
Islamophobic victimisation in public in the United Kingdom.
According to Mythen et al. (2009), the concept of `victimisa-
tion' is understood as the act by which someone is rendered
a victim, the experience of being a victim in parallel with the
socio-cultural process by which this occurs. Following ter-
rorist attacks such as 9/11 in the United States and 7/7 in the
United Kingdom, there has been much discussion about the
growth of Islamophobia in the West (see, for example, Allen,
2010; Poynting and Mason, 2007; Sayyid and Vakil, 2011).
However, this discussion has not been accompanied by as
much empirical analysis of Islamophobic victimisation as
one might expect (Moosavi, 2015). In particular, there is a
dearth of studies examining the lived experiences of Muslim
women who wear the niqab in public in the West. As a result,
they remain a relatively invisible population in research
terms, despite their vulnerability to Islamophobic hostility
and attacks in public spaces.
The research took the form of a qualitative study based on
individual and focus group interviews with veiled Muslim
women coupled with auto-ethnography whereby I wore the
full veil ­ including jilbab (long dress), hijab (headscarf) and
niqab (face veil) ­ for prolonged periods of time in public
(see image below).
The fieldwork took place in Midland City1 between 2011
and 2012. The study comprised 60 individual interviews and
20 focus group discussions with veiled Muslim women who
had been victims of Islamophobia. Prospective participants
were identified through local Muslim organisations, includ-
ing mosques, Muslim schools and Islamic centres.Additional
steps were taken to access potential participants who may
have remained unidentified by these organisations, and this
helped to broaden the sample at least to some extent. For
example, I attended a number of social events for Muslim
women in Midland City in order to raise awareness about the
study and identify prospective participants. Additional assis-
tance in securing access to participants came from the
Student Islamic Societies at two local universities.
Participants unaffiliated to any local Muslim organisations or
groups were also recruited through snowball sampling.
Participants were given the option of taking part in either an
individual interview or focus group discussion. Individual,
in-depth interviews allow for `rich' data to be collected with
detailed descriptions of participants' lived experiences
(Hennink et al., 2011). This approach is especially valuable
for researching sensitive issues that require confidentiality
and a more intimate setting for data collection, and this is
particularly appropriate for hard-to-access groups such as
veiled Muslim women. Focus group interviews incorporate
Figure 1. The Author

the strengths of qualitative research in terms of gathering
rich data while generating additional insights through group
interactions (Curtis and Curtis, 2011). In the context of this
particular piece of research, the focus group method afforded
the possibility of open discussion among veiled Muslim
women with similar or different experiences of Islamophobic
victimisation while also highlighting collectively held beliefs
and attitudes.
With respect to employing auto-ethnography, I wore the
veil for 4 weeks as part of my daily routine in public places
in Midland City, including streets, shopping centres and pub-
lic means of transport. This aspect of the research followed
an open-ended process. I began with a specific question,
`How does my perceived identity as a veiled Muslim woman
render me vulnerable to victimisation in public places?'
Throughout the fieldwork, I kept a diary in order to record
my experiences and reflections. However, it is important to
point out that auto-ethnography was not part of my original
research methodology. When I was initially developing my
research project, my plan was to use individual and focus
group interviews with veiled Muslim women. However, dur-
ing the pilot interviews some participants suggested that I
wear the veil in order to see for myself the level of abuse and
hostility that they suffered on a daily basis. Some partici-
pants (although not all, as discussed later) actually insisted
that I wear the veil in order to accurately interpret their sto-
ries and represent their voices regarding the nature, extent
and impact of Islamophobic victimisation. I responded to my
participants' suggestion/invitation to dress as ­ and therefore
have the experiences of ­ the insider. As will be discussed
later, this approach did improve my ability to understand and
analyse the data gathered through the individual and focus
groups with veiled Muslim women. Also, adopting this
approach did get me closer to those participants who sup-
ported this method (particularly in terms of access and qual-
ity of data elicited in interviews and focus groups), although
for those who disapproved of this approach I may have actu-
ally constructed barriers and therefore lessened access and
rapport. With respect to my experiences in the field, the vari-
ous situations that I encountered because of my adopted
Muslim identity resulted in me being subjected to verbal
abuse, harassment and potential physical attacks.
Experiences of victimisation
Verbal harassment and intimidation
My experiences of harassment and victimisation as a result of
adopting a `visible' Muslim identity included name-calling,
swearing, threats of physical violence, persistent staring,
derogatory forms of humour and direct accusatory questions.
Underlying all these forms of verbal harassment and intimi-
dation was a clear sense of Islamophobic sentiment and hos-
tility, and this was made apparent through the language used
by the perpetrators. Typical examples of the comments people
made included shouting `Muslim terrorist', `suicide bomber'
and `you lot are terrorists', which indicated people's percep-
tions of veiled Muslim women as a security or terrorist threat.
Indeed, research shows that visible Muslims (i.e. those read-
ily identifiable as Muslims through their dress or other aspects
of their appearance and behaviour) and veiled Muslim
women, in particular, are often targeted because their abusers
hold the view that all Muslims are terrorists or terrorist sym-
pathisers (Githens-Mazer and Lambert, 2010). Seen in this
light, the veiled female body offers a visual representation of
`radical' Islam. Additionally, I was subjected to swearing
such as `Muslim whore', `fucking bitch', `Muslim scum' and
`your religion is filth'. The comments and gestures perpetra-
tors made were sometimes threatening as indicated in the fol-
lowing diary extracts:
A skinhead man made knife gestures at me whilst I was walking
on ­-- Lane. I feel like a walking target. I fear for my life.
In town a group of white British men shouted at me `we will
burn your fucking Quran. You Muslims kill Christians, so all of
us Christians will come kill all of you Muslims. We want to
teach your kind a lesson'. I think they are EDL [English Defence
League] members because they are carrying EDL flags. I feel
very intimidated and I am worried that they might be carrying
weapons.
The wearing of the niqab carries connotations of gender
inequality, religious extremism, lack of integration and
threats to `British/Western ideals' (Chakraborti and Zempi,
2012). It has been referred to as the `icon of the intolerable
difference' between `us' and `them' (Scott, 2007: 5).
Correspondingly, there were incidents where the nature of
the verbal abuse suggested Islamophobic, racist and xeno-
phobic sentiments, as demonstrated in the following diary
extracts:
I was walking on ­-- Road today and a group of teenagers
began mocking my niqab and swearing at me. They told me to
`fuck off back to Afghanistan' and one of them also shouted
`EDL, EDL, EDL!'
I was on the bus going home and an elderly man moved seats as
I sat next to him.2 When I got off the bus he told me `you're not
welcome here, go back to where you came from'.
As these quotes demonstrate, Islamophobic attitudes are
often intertwined with racist and xenophobic sentiments.
However, this is not to overlook the fact that veiled Muslim
women become victims of targeted violence because their
abusers have been motivated either solely or partially by
other factors. For example, the sight of the veiled female
body might provoke anger in some individuals on sexist as
well as Islamophobic grounds. In this sense, the face and
body of a woman are an object of sexual attraction, and when
these are covered, it disrupts public expectations of how
Zempi 5
women should behave and dress in public in order to visually
`please'men. This emphasises the notion of appropriate fem-
inine sexuality, which ensures that the behaviour and attire of
women are strictly monitored (Dwyer, 1999). This was evi-
dent in incidents where I was subjected to sexual harassment
such as whistling, catcalls and kissing sounds. These experi-
ences were typical of those mentioned by my participants.
This form of sexual harassment is motivated by a male gaze
that desires possession of women's bodies and `wants to see'
(Al-Saji, 2010).
While in most cases verbal abuse was momentary when
walking on the street or while waiting for the bus, in other cases
I was subjected to sustained periods of invisible Islamophobic
victimisation, particularly when being stuck within a confined
space, such as on public transport and in a shop. By invisible
forms, I am referring to what might be best described as subtle
and potentially more pervasive manifestations of hostility. This
can be the case where Islamophobic prejudice or hostility is
manifested in a less overt manner than that typically associated
with Islamophobia, and this highlights the importance of appre-
ciating Islamophobic victimisation as a continuum rather than
as discrete one-off incidents (Zempi and Chakraborti, 2014).
Specifically, unnecessary or persistent staring and being
ignored were common experiences as a veiled woman. The fol-
lowing accounts are taken from my research diary to illustrate
examples of invisible Islamophobic hostility in terms of being
ignored or refused to be served:
I am in the fruit market in town and the stall owner refuses to
serve me. I feel humiliated and ashamed.
I am waiting in the queue to pay for an item in a shop in [a
shopping centre in MidlandCity]. In front of me there is a white
man who is served immediately. The person at the till seems to
ignore me. I can't help thinking `is it because I'm wearing the
veil?' I feel angry as I am a regular customer at this store but it
seems that the moment I put on the veil, the quality of customer
service changes from excellent to zero.
Furthermore, the only example of a physical attack was
when a passing car threw eggs at me, as indicated in the fol-
lowing diary extract:
I feel quite upset as a car drove past me on ­-- Lane and a white
male threw eggs at me and then he shouted something about
Muslims. I am so shocked that I did not manage to get the car's
number plate.
Similarly, my participants described incidents where they
had eggs, stones, alcohol, water bombs, bottles, take-away
food and rubbish thrown at them by people on the street or
from moving cars. Nevertheless, I felt somewhat lucky
because, unlike some of my participants who suffered more
serious incidents of physical abuse, I only experienced rela-
tively low-level manifestations of Islamophobia. For example,
several participants described suffering physical abuse such as
having their veils taken off, pushing, shoving, experiencing
sustained physical assaults and even incidents where passing
vehicles had attempted to run them over. Knowledge of these
incidents heightened my concerns that verbal abuse could
escalate into violent assault. Indeed, I was afraid that I could
suffer similar experiences. I knew that I was also vulnerable to
physical abuse because of the visibility of my perceived
Muslim identity and as a result, I was scared for my safety in
public.
Impact and responses
Verbal attacks coupled with the possibility of suffering phys-
ical attacks affected me emotionally, including feeling afraid,
shocked, upset or angry on particular occasions. Such feel-
ings were particularly pronounced immediately after an inci-
dent, but they seemed to develop into long-term anxieties. I
soon developed sleep problems and lost my appetite.
Moreover, there were days when I felt reluctant to leave my
house. I started to feel cautious, nervous, suspicious and dis-
trustful of people I encountered in public spaces.
The possibility of verbal or physical violence meant that I
felt anxious, vulnerable and exposed when walking on the
street or travelling on public transport. I soon became iso-
lated and withdrawn. Experiences of Islamophobic victimi-
sation also increased feelings of insecurity, vulnerability and
anxiety among the veiled Muslim women who took part in
the study. Bowling (2009) states that persistent victimisation
can undermine the security of actual and potential victims
and induce fear and anxiety. Participants reported panic
attacks, worry, extreme anxiety and depression, which were
said to derive from the fear of future victimisation.
Clearly, employing auto-ethnography had emotional, psy-
chological and physiological impacts upon my wellbeing.
Denshire and Lee (2013) argue that `putting the self into the
picture at all is challenging enough in this context, but putting
the very notion of a self at risk opens up places of vulnerabil-
ity' (p. 224). However, at the time I consciously downplayed
the seriousness of the situation and felt a strong need to portray
myself as coping with the fieldwork to my PhD supervisors,
colleagues and all others around me because I feared that I
would be prevented from completing the auto-ethnographic
part of the research. I suffered in silence and received no sup-
port for experiencing this victimisation. Nevertheless, as dis-
cussed below, the value of potentially putting myself at risk
was premised on the insights into the victimisation of veiled
Muslim women that auto-ethnography provided me with,
which would only have been possible through wearing the veil
myself. In other words, gaining insider knowledge is some-
thing that I would not have learnt from the interviews alone.
Outsider versus insider status in auto-
ethnography
As an Orthodox Christian woman investigating Islamophobic
victimisation, my research was primarily from an outsider per-
spective. The researcher's positionality as insider or outsider
6 Methodological Innovations
in relation to their participants influences all aspects of the
research process including research design, access, data col-
lection and data interpretation. Positionality is determined
``by where one stands in relation to `the other'' (Merriam
et al., 2001: 411). In insider research, the researcher conducts
research with a group of which he or she is a member, based
on characteristics such as religion, race/ethnicity, gender and
sexual identity (Kanuha, 2000). Insider research is considered
to be from an emic perspective, as it involves the description
of a phenomenon that is understood by the researcher who has
also experienced it (Spiers, 2000).
Employingauto-ethnographyinresearchintoIslamophobic
victimisation allowed me to gain insider knowledge. As
Atkinson (2015: 28) points out, it is not simply enough to
understand the social world `from the point of view' of your
participants; rather, the ability to take the role of the other and
to enter into some sort of interpretative comprehension is cru-
cial for producing knowledge. In the context of this study,
role adoption includes taking the role of the other in order to
make sense of veiled Muslim women's lived experiences and
the world around them ­ a process of attempting to put into
writing `what it is like to be somebody else' (Van Maanen,
2009: 16). By employing auto-ethnography, my reality, as
researcher-participant, offers a window onto the world as
experienced by participant (Mykhalovskiy, 1997), one that
could have been experienced only through wearing the veil.
Becoming an insider allowed me to better tell the story of my
participants and incorporate my own views, thoughts, and
personal stories of victimisation in public in order to comple-
ment and, as a result, enrich the story of my participants
(Denzin, 1989; Reed-Danahay, 1997).
A common argument in the research literature is that
insiders are more likely to be able to understand and accu-
rately represent participants' experiences (Labaree, 2002).
This can be particularly useful in research with groups that
have been under-represented and socially or culturally mar-
ginalised. Similarly, participants might be more willing to
share their experiences. It is as if they feel, `You are one of us
and it is us versus them (those on the outside who don't
understand)' (Corbin-Dwyer and Buckle, 2009: 58).
Correspondingly, outsider researchers are accused of lacking
understanding (Savvides et al., 2014). From this perspective,
outsiders cannot understand or represent accurately the expe-
riences of their participants. This is important when research
is conducted with oppressed, marginalised and `other' com-
munities (Hayfield and Huxley, 2015).
Initially, participants considered me as an outsider to their
religion, culture and experiences as victims of Islamophobia
because of my religious identity as an Orthodox Christian.
Some of my participants insisted that I wear the veil in order
to accurately interpret their stories and represent their voices
regarding the nature, extent and impact of Islamophobic vic-
timisation. Despite explicit religious differences between
participants and myself, auto-ethnography fostered empathy,
rapport and trust. In this regard, wearing the veil enhanced
access to participants by demonstrating that I was willing to
`take the extra step' in order to develop in-depth knowledge
and understanding of their experiences. As Zubair et al.
(2012) point out, researchers' bodily appearances and bodily
actions, adaptations and interactions are important markers
of their identity in the fieldwork. Participants may perceive
and judge researchers positively or negatively and/or as
insiders or outsiders based on their embodied identity
(Ellingson, 2006). Okely (2007: 71) argues that researchers
often have to learn to adapt their bodily performances and
actions ­ including the way they dress ­ in order to fit in
with, and be accepted among, those they are researching,
especially when they are closely scrutinised and instructed.
Attempts to change, however clumsy, are often interpreted as
signs of respect. This demonstrates the important role the
researcher's body and behaviour in developing trust and rap-
port with participants.
Overall, I won a great deal of approval among most par-
ticipants. I felt accepted by certain individuals, who were
perhaps reluctant to take part in the study because of my non-
Muslim background. In addition to providing me access,
using auto-ethnography enhanced participant engagement
and revelation throughout the research process. Sharing sim-
ilar experiences with participants granted me legitimacy in
the field, at least with some of the respondents. However,
although the majority of participants were supportive of my
decision to wear the veil, some participants expressed disa-
greement. One participant felt that it was disrespectful to
Islamic laws to wear the veil as a non-Muslim. She felt that
the veil is not simply a piece of cloth that anyone can wear;
rather, it is part of practising Islam in line with praying five
times a day, reading the Quran and fasting during Ramadan.
Moreover, in the context of a focus group discussion in a
mosque, some participants argued that by wearing the veil as
a social experiment, I was minimising the Muslim woman's
experience. They argued that spending a day, a week or a
year experiencing the stigma, prejudice and discrimination
that veiled Muslim women deal with on a day-to-day basis
does not actually reflect their true experiences. In both cases,
the authenticity of my veiled auto-ethnography and my abil-
ity to fathom veiled Muslim women's experiences as victims
of Islamophobia were questioned.
According to Labaree (2002), the advantage we have in
knowing the community may be weakened or strengthened
based on the ways in which our various social identities may
shift during interaction with participants or based on the
degree of perceived or real closeness to participants as a result
of shared experience or social identities. On one hand,
researcher self-disclosure might reduce the hierarchical
nature of the researcher­participant relationship and encour-
age participant disclosure and facilitate trust and mutual iden-
tification within the relationship (McDonald, 2001). However,
self-disclosure might also make the researchers vulnerable
and open them to criticism from others, including participants
and other researchers (McDonald, 2001; MacCormack,
Zempi 7
2001). It is not always easy or, indeed, possible to predict how
one will be placed by the participants ­ how commonality or
difference will be constructed, interpreted or experienced
(Ryan and Golden, 2006).
Relatedly, I was often asked (especially by older partici-
pants) whether I wanted to convert to Islam. Since my answer
was negative, I was questioned as to why I was interested in
doing this research and even wearing the veil. A couple of
participants gave me booklets, which included information
about the benefits of converting to Islam, or prayed for me to
convert to Islam. For me to ask them not to pray for me or
refuse these booklets could have jeopardised rapport and
even their participation in the study, so I accepted their book-
lets and prayers. Zubair et al. (2012) point out that research
participants are not necessarily a vulnerable and passive
group vis-à-vis the researcher but can be active agents who
exercise considerable power over the research process and
research relationships.
Irrespective of whether respondents approved or disap-
proved of my decision to wear the veil, a key concern among
all participants was the fact that I would be recognised as a
Muslim. Participants felt that being identified as a follower
of Islam comes with tremendous responsibility. They
explained that the veil is not merely a covering but, more
importantly, it is behaviour, manners and appearance in pub-
lic. They advised me to dress and behave in a religiously and
culturally appropriate manner throughout the fieldwork,
which I took seriously during fieldwork. For example, they
advised me to wear a black veil instead of a colourful one, for
the purposes of modesty. Also, they advised me to avoid
wearing excessive make up (especially in the area around the
eyes). Moreover, they pointed out that it was not appropriate
to be seen to shake hands with men, to sit or stand next to
them or to talk to men unnecessarily. They also advised me
to avoid eye contact with men in public. Thus, the process of
becoming an insider through veiled auto-ethnography
involved learning about cultural and religious norms as well
as codes of behaviour for veiled Muslim women in Islam, in
addition to knowledge about Islamophobic victimisation.
Overall, I usually followed their advice during fieldwork in
order to minimise the risk of portraying Islam in a negative
light. However, it was not always easy to remember to follow
their suggestions, particularly in relation to sitting or stand-
ing next to men.
The researcher's positionality is not fixed but dynamic.
Aguilar (1981: 24) argues that insiders and outsiders `must
meet diametrically different demands ... the outsider must to
some extent get into the natives' heads, skins, or shoes,
whereas the insider must get out of his or her own'. Auto-
ethnography blurs the boundary between researcher and
researched by `[situating] self within the research process
and its written products, by making the self the object of the
research and by developing a `reflexive connection between
the researcher's and participants' lives' (Brunier, 2006: 410).
By employing auto-ethnography, I was neither a complete
outsider nor a total insider, thereby operating in a fluid space
somewhere between the two. The notion of the `space
between'considers qualitative researchers as `multiple insid-
ers and outsiders' (Labaree, 2002: 102). As Corbin-Dwyer
and Buckle (2009) point out,
the notion of the space between challenges the dichotomy of
insider versus outsider status. To present these concepts in a
dualistic manner is overly simplistic. It is restrictive to lock into
a notion that emphasizes either/or, one or the other, you are in or
you are out. (p. 60)
Within this framework, researchers are not either insiders or
outsiders; rather, they continuously negotiate their multiple
identities and aspects of the research process by moving flu-
idly within the space between.
Usefulness of auto-ethnography for
understanding victimisation
Using auto-ethnography for understanding victimisation is
novel in criminological ethnography. Purposeful attempts to
research victimisation this way are almost unheard of. My
experiences of auto-ethnography on victimisation suggest
that this research method can be a double-edged sword. On
one hand, using auto-ethnography offered unique methodo-
logical advantages. Specifically, the inclusion of auto-eth-
nography during fieldwork shows that research participants
are neither passive nor neutral. It is interactive, creative,
selective and interpretive, giving meaning and suggesting
further paths of enquiry (Rock, 2015). Concurrently, my
positionality changed from outsider to insider, thereby oper-
ating in a fluid space somewhere between the two.According
to Atkinson (2015), flexible fieldwork means that our work
is a developmental, interactive process. Fieldwork conducted
in a reflexive mode can help generate insightful perspectives.
This ties in with the logic of grounded theory, which entails
going back to the data and forward into analysis and then
returning to the field to gather further data and refine the
emerging theoretical framework (Atkinson, 2015).
On the other hand, using auto-ethnography in the form of
covert research entailed certain ethical problems. During the
process of auto-ethnography, I assumed a covert role and did
not disclose the fact that I was a researcher to members of the
public. As Murphy and Dingwall (2007) point out, auto-eth-
nographers find it especially difficult to establish the bound-
aries of informed consent and whether or not to divulge
researchers' identities in certain cases. This is not because
researchers wish to engage in covert research, but because of
the nature of the research itself, it becomes all but impossible
to solicit consent to the research that is informed, in the sense
of being predictable before the research itself is carried out
(Atkinson, 2015).
Admittedly, using auto-ethnography in the form of covert
research was perhaps ethically dubious due to there being a
8 Methodological Innovations
level of deception involved. However, covert research can
uncover phenomena that would otherwise remain inscrutable
(see, for example, Prokos and Padavic (2002) who docu-
mented sexism in a police academy). In the context of this
study, assuming a covert role was essential for the success of
the research. It is highly likely that people's awareness of my
status as a researcher would influence how they treated me,
which would potentially mask the true dimensions of public
expressions of Islamophobic prejudice and hostility. Also, I
caused no harm to those people who victimised me, and I did
practice self-disclosure with women who wear the veil ­ the
research was negotiated with them. Therefore, although there
are important ethical questions here, with some feminist
scholars positioning self-disclose as sound and necessary
research practice (Oakley, 1981; Reinharz, 1992), the fact
remains that in this instance, withholding my true identity
was ethically defensible.
Insider knowledge generated through auto-ethnography
makes a substantive contribution to our understanding of
Islamophobic attacks and the impact they have upon veiled
Muslim women. Despite putting myself at risk, wearing the
veil helped me to deepen my understanding of the targeted
victimisation of veiled Muslim women. It allowed me to
experience many of the emotions that Muslim women feel
when they wear the veil in public, such as depression, fear,
anxiety, suspicion, anger and isolation. This would not have
been possible through the interviews alone. Consequently,
auto-ethnography affected the formulation of knowledge
and its interpretation. At the same time, knowledge is provi-
sional, bound temporally and contextually, shaped both by
the particular purposes and experiences of the researcher­
participant and by the encounters which researchers had
with others in the field (Rock, 2015). From this perspective,
perhaps I can only claim to have secondary knowledge of
veiled Muslim women's experiences as victims. My second-
ary knowledge may be useful, public, accessible and illumi-
nating, and it is also dependent and derivative. Wearing the
veil for a limited time does not allow me to fully understand
the depth of veiled Muslim women's experiences of
Islamophobia in public. The ultimate authority on experi-
ences of Islamophobia remains veiled Muslim women
themselves, and my own experiences can only complement
their stories. As a result, one might argue that employing
auto-ethnography in this study was not quite authentic and
certainly not the real thing itself (Rock, 2015). One might
also argue that employing auto-ethnography was not neces-
sary, and one might even go further and argue that it under-
mines attempts to assert agency for the female veil-wearing
Muslim population ­ or that it patronises them.
However, although I had a fleeting glimpse of matters
known much more intensely and extensively by veiled Muslim
women themselves, auto-ethnography provided a nuanced and
unique insight into their vulnerability to Islamophobic vic-
timisation in public. The use of my own experiences of
Islamophobia through `veiled auto-ethnography' seems to be
very distinctive. Although I am not Muslim, my experiences
are no less valid to the experiences of my participants. In fact,
it is my non-Muslim background that makes my experiences
so useful in terms of recognising the role of wearing the veil as
a `trigger' to Islamophobic attacks. Clearly, these attacks
would not have happened to me had I not wore the veil. The
fact that I do not normally wear the veil allowed me to see the
difference in people's behaviour in public spaces.
Finally, auto-ethnography inspired data analysis and
writing. Not only did it inform the construction of the text
(because of my status as the producer and to some extent,
the product of the study) but it also moved me to write.
Despite my non-Muslim background, I felt connected to
my participants, and thus, I became more passionate about
this subject. This notion of responsibility to `do justice' to
their experiences, and commitment to maximise the impact
of the research, stemmed from the fact that I was now `one
of them'. As such, using auto-ethnography helped the inter-
pretation of the data in terms of understanding veiled
Muslim women's experiences as victims of Islamophobia
and inspired me to make a difference in their lives through
raising awareness about this problem through publications,
conferences and engagement with local and national organ-
isations. Despite the emotional, psychological and physio-
logical costs, using veiled auto-ethnography enriched the
stories of my participants and added credibility to the
research and investigation of a marginalised and hard-to-
reach population.
Conclusion
In this article, I have explored the application of auto-eth-
nography to the study of victimisation. Specifically, I
reflected upon my personal experiences of undertaking auto-
ethnography on victimisation through wearing the Muslim
veil in public. I argued for the novelty of using the auto-eth-
nographic approach for the study of victimisation. Indeed,
this approach is extremely novel in criminological research.
I described the stigma, prejudice and discrimination that
I experienced when wearing the veil in public. Moreover, I
provided a glimpse into the stigma felt by these women who
wear the veil every day of their lives, and how they have to
navigate themselves through a hostile world that most peo-
ple fail to acknowledge. Despite my outsider status, I used
auto-ethnography purposefully and tactically in order to
research the experiences of victimised others. This approach
illustrates that we can understand identity as flexible rather
than fixed; researchers can use their identity as a tool in the
auto-ethnographic toolkit. My personal experiences of using
auto-ethnography on victimisation demonstrate that auto-
ethnography is neither narcissistic nor lazy. In this study, it
involved being directed by participants in the research and
being willing to expose myself, emotionally and physically.
This research strategy challenges those who say that auto-
ethnography is too personal, narcissistic and self-indulgent
and those who fear that the researcher's identity is now what
the research is about.
Zempi 9
My strategy illustrates something new for auto-ethno-
graphic methods: the opportunity to research victimisation
through auto-ethnography. In this regard, there are advan-
tages and disadvantages that can be applied for others who
might consider using a similar approach. For example, doing
auto-ethnography allowed me to gain insider knowledge,
which would not have been possible through the interviews
alone. Importantly, gaining insider knowledge contributed to
the process of understanding, empathising and more accu-
rately representing victims' experiences. Nevertheless, there
were costs involved. Using my own experiences as the vehi-
cle, I illustrated the harmful effects of victimisation such as
emotional, psychological and physical impacts. Also, there
were ethical issues involved such as putting myself at risk,
doing covert research and upsetting some participants by
offending Islamic sensibilities. Therefore, researchers need
to balance the risks presented by auto-ethnographic research
on victimisation against the opportunities to generate appre-
ciative criminological data.

Notes
1. I have anonymised the city where the fieldwork took place.
`MidlandCity' is one of the most ethnically and religiously
diverse cities in the United Kingdom, with a high population
of Muslims, specifically of veiled Muslim women.
2. I acknowledge that this could be seen as a contradiction
because, as I will discuss later, appropriate behaviour to
accompany wearing the niqab included not sitting or standing
next to men. However, I sometimes forgot that it would be
inappropriate for myself (as a veiled Muslim woman) to be
seen to sit or stand next to men.
