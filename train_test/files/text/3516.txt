ABSTRACT
Neuroinflammation during multiple sclerosis involves im-
mune cell infiltration and disruption of the BBB (blood­
brain barrier). Both processes can be visualized by MRI (mag-
netic resonance imaging), in multiple sclerosis patients and
in the animal model EAE (experimental autoimmune en-
cephalomyelitis). We previously showed that VSOPs (very
small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles) reveal CNS
(central nervous system) lesions in EAE which are not de-
tectable by conventional contrast agents in MRI. We hy-
pothesized that VSOP may help detect early, subtle inflam-
matory events that would otherwise remain imperceptible.
To investigate the capacity of VSOP to reveal early events
in CNS inflammation, we induced EAE in SJL mice using
encephalitogenic T-cells, and administered VSOP prior to
onset of clinical symptoms. In parallel, we administered
VSOP to mice at peak disease, and to unmanipulated con-
trols. We examined the distribution of VSOP in the CNS
by MRI and histology. Prior to disease onset, in asymp-
tomatic mice, VSOP accumulated in the choroid plexus and
in spinal cord meninges in the absence of overt inflamma-
tion. However, VSOP was undetectable in the CNS of non-

immunized control mice. At peak disease, VSOP was broadly
distributed; we observed particles in perivascular inflamma-
tory lesions with apparently preserved glia limitans. More-
over, at peak disease, VSOP was prominent in the choroid
plexus and was seen in elongated endothelial structures,
co-localized with phagocytes, and diffusely disseminated in
the parenchyma, suggesting multiple entry mechanisms of
VSOP into the CNS. Thus, using VSOP we were able to dis-
criminate between inflammatory events occurring in estab-
lished EAE and, importantly, we identified CNS alterations
that appear to precede immune cell infiltration and clinical
onset.

INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory diseases of the CNS (central nervous sys-
tem), such as multiple sclerosis, are characterized by the
asnneuro.org / Volume 5 (2) / art:e00110 89
J. M. Millward and others
infiltration of immune cells from the periphery. To gain en-
try to the CNS, immune cells must cross the BBB (blood­
brain barrier), a complex multi-step process that involves
interaction with numerous cellular and non-cellular ele-
ments (Owens et al., 2008). Disruption of the BBB associ-
ated with active inflammation can be visualized in vivo by
contrast-enhanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Gd-
DTPA (gadopentetate dimeglumine)-enhancing lesions are
also detectible in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis,
EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), in which
it was histologically confirmed that the MRI lesions corre-
sponded to focal inflammation and BBB breakdown (Smorod-
chenko et al., 2007). Nevertheless, discrepancies remain be-
tween the presence of Gd-enhancing lesions and the clinical
severity in both multiple sclerosis and EAE (Barkhof, 2002;
Okuda et al., 2009). To overcome this so-called clinical­
radiological paradox (Wuerfel et al., 2007) superparamag-
netic iron oxide nanoparticles with strong magnetic suscep-
tibility effects were applied (Weinstein et al., 2010). Unlike
Gd-DTPA, iron oxide particles are efficiently taken up by
phagocytic cells, and partition to the liver, spleen and lymph
nodes. The capacity of iron oxide particles to be phagocytosed
has enabled the use of MRI to track macrophage dynamics
in EAE studies (Oude Engberink et al., 2010; Rausch et al.,
2003, 2004). VSOPs (very small superparamagnetic iron oxide
particles) are electrostatically stabilized with a citrate coat-
ing, and present with a hydrodynamic diameter of only 7 nm,
which is much smaller compared with other iron oxide par-
ticles (Taupitz et al., 2000; Wagner et al., 2002). Originally
developed as a blood pool contrast agent (Schnorr et al.,
2004), we previously showed VSOP to be efficiently phago-
cytosed (Stroh et al., 2006) and to have the potential to de-
tect lesions in EAE (Wuerfel et al., 2007). In addition to being
phagocytosed, we previously showed that VSOP could effi-
ciently extravasate and highlight both acute BBB disruption
and persistent lesions, being detectable by MRI in the brain
up to 20 days post application (Tysiak et al., 2009; Wuerfel
et al., 2007). Thus VSOP may be regarded as having prop-
erties intermediate between Gd-based contrast agents and
other larger-sized iron oxide nanoparticles.
In a previous study, we compared lesions characterized
by VSOP with those enhancing Gd-DTPA in EAE, and showed
that each Gd-DTPA-enhancing lesion correlated with T2*-
signal loss after VSOP injection; however, numerous in-
stances of lesions were detected only with VSOP and not with
Gd-DTPA (Tysiak et al., 2009). We hypothesized that these
lesions detected only with VSOP may represent inflamma-
tory lesions at a relatively early stage, in which the im-
mune cells are confined to the perivascular space. To fur-
ther investigate our hypothesis, we here administered VSOP
to EAE mice both prior to clinical disease onset, when only
very early inflammatory events may occur, and at peak
disease. We undertook a detailed histological examination
of the spinal cord and the brain parenchyma to inves-
tigate the tissue distribution of VSOP at early and peak
neuroinflammation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Induction of EAE
All procedures were performed in accordance with protocols
approved by the local animal welfare committee (LAGeSo)
in accordance with national and international guidelines to
minimize discomfort to animals (86/609/EEC). Female SJL/J
mice were purchased from Janvier and were housed under
standard conditions. For induction of passive EAE, donor mice
were immunized subcutaneously with 200 g of PLP (prote-
olipid protein) peptide139-151
purity >95% (Pepceuticals Ltd)
together with Complete Freund's adjuvant and heat-killed
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra, Difco). Ten days after
immunization, mice were killed by cervical dislocation and
the draining lymph nodes were collected. Lymph node cells
were isolated by macerating the tissue through a 100 m
mesh. The cells were incubated at 37C for 4 days in the
presence of 12.5 g/ml PLP peptide in RPMI 1640 medium
[supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml peni-
cillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 10% FBS (fetal bovine
serum)]. Then 5×106 lymphocyte blasts were injected intra-
venously into a total of 34 syngenic recipient mice. Mice
were assigned a clinical score daily: 0, no disease; 1, tail
weakness; 2, paraparesis; 3, paraplegia; 4, paraplegia with
forelimb weakness; 5, moribund or dead animals.
MRI procedures
MRI was done using a 7 Tesla Bruker Pharmascan 70/16 ro-
dent MR scanner (Bruker Biospin), applying a 20 mm RF-
Quadrature-Volume head coil. Mice were anaesthetized with
1.5­2.0% isofluorane in 30% O2
and 70% N2
O administered
via face mask, under continuous ventilation monitoring (Bio
Trig System, Bruker Biospin). The animals were placed on a
bed with circulating heated water to maintain constant body
temperature at 37C.
Sixteen mice underwent axial and coronal T1- and T2*-
weighted native MRI to establish the pre-contrast base-
line. Subsequently, these mice received 0.2 mmol/kg Gd-
DTPA (Magnevist, Bayer-Schering AG) intravenously and
were immediately scanned again for contrast-enhanced T1-
weighted imaging. After this, the mice received intravenous
0.2 mmol/kg VSOP (VSOP-R1 preparation batch 080610, pro-
duced by Charit´
e Institute of Radiology with the following
physicochemical properties: 16% citric acid (weight citric
acid:iron); r1 = 18.54; r2 = 47.15 at 0.94 T; hydrodynamic di-
ameter 90% of particles 5.6­8.7 nm; crystal size [TEM (trans-
mission electron microscopy)]: 4.8 +

physicochemical properties are comparable with VSOP-C184
which has already been tested in human clinical trials up to
phase II (Wagner et al., 2011). After VSOP application, mice

were returned to the home cage and T2*-weighted sequences
were acquired 24 h later.
T1- and T2*-weighted images were acquired with the fol-
lowing parameters: axial T1w images (RARE, TE 10.5 ms, TR
804.1 ms, 0.5 mm slice thickness, matrix 256, FOV (field of
view) 2.85 cm, four averages, 30 slices, scan time 6 min 51 s);
coronal T1w images (RARE, TE 10.6 ms, TR 938.1 ms, 0.5 mm
slice thickness, matrix 256, FOV 2.85 cm, four averages, 25
slices, scan time 8 min 32 s); axial T2*w images (FLASH, TE
7.2 ms, TR 619.7 ms, flip angle 30, 0.44 mm slice thick-
ness, matrix 256, FOV 2.85 cm, four averages, 40 slices, scan
time 10 min 34 s); coronal T2*w images (FLASH, TE 7.2 ms,
TR 386.2 ms, flip angle 30, 0.43 mm slice thickness, matrix
256, FOV 2.85 cm, four averages, 25 slices, scan time 6 min
35 s). Data acquisition was done with Paravision 4.0 (Bruker
Biospin).
Histology
In all cases, mice were processed for histology 24 h after
intravenous administration of VSOP. As a control, 10 unman-
ipulated SJL mice also received VSOP and were processed
for histology the same way. After terminal anaesthesia, mice
were transcardially perfused with 20 ml PBS, then with 20 ml
zinc fixation solution (0.5% zinc acetate, 0.5% zinc chloride,
0.05% calcium acetate) (Schellenberger et al., 2011). Brains
and spinal cords were then extracted and subsequently post-
fixed in zinc solution for 3 days at room temperature (25C).
The tissues were then cryoprotected by incubation overnight
at 4C in 30% sucrose in PBS, then embedded in O.C.T. and
frozen in methylbutane with dry ice. The tissues were cut
into 12 m sections on a cryostat, and stained with H&E
(haematoxylin and eosin) according to standard procedures.
For immunostaining, tissue sections were blocked with
avidin, biotin and normal rabbit serum, then incubated
overnight at 4C with rabbit anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic
protein; Dako), rabbit anti-iba-1 (Wako) or rabbit anti-
laminin (Novus) antibodies; all primary antibodies diluted
1:1000. The sections were then incubated with biotiny-
lated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories),
then streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase and visualized with
Vector NovaRED Peroxidase substrate (Vector Laboratories).
Prussian Blue staining for iron detection was done using
Perl's method (incubation with 1% potassium hexacyanofer-
rate and 1% HCl), followed by counterstaining with Nuclear
Fast Red.
RESULTS
VSOP distribution in CNS prior to EAE onset
In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the utility of
VSOP to detect early events in EAE pathogenesis, prior to

the onset of clinical signs. In a previous study, we admin-
istered VSOP to mice with established Gd-DTPA-enhancing
lesions, and demonstrated that VSOP revealed lesions that
were not detectable by Gd-DTPA (Tysiak et al., 2009). In
the present study, we examined the CNS of mice between
4 and 6 days after adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T-
cells from PLP139-151
-immunized donor mice ­ a time point
that precedes the development of clinical disability. Figure 1
shows the distribution of inflammatory pathology and histo-
logical detection of VSOP in brain and spinal cord (Figures 1A
and 1B, respectively). VSOP was detected in the brain in eight
out of 15 mice (53%) at this pre-onset phase. At this early
phase, the VSOP was seen exclusively in the choroid plexus
in the lateral and third ventricles, and in the interventricular
foramen (Figure 1A).
Of these eight mice presenting VSOP in the brain prior to
EAE onset, five show VSOP in the absence of a pathological
accumulation of immune cells as depicted in Figures 2(A) and
2(B). In these pictures, representative examples of the pres-
ence of VSOP, revealed by Prussian Blue iron staining located

Figure 2 VSOP detected in CNS prior to EAE clinical onset (4­6 days post transfer)
VSOP (blue staining) was observed in the stroma of the choroid plexus of the lateral (A) and fourth (B) ventricles (arrows), in the absence
of inflammatory cells. VSOP was also seen in choroid plexus in the presence of mild inflammation (circle) (C). VSOP was detected in spinal
cord meninges (D) and vessels (E) in the absence of inflammation, and in the presence of inflammatory cells (F). Original magnification:

within the choroid plexus stroma (i.e. basal to the choroid
epithelium), of the lateral ventricle (Figure 2A) and the
fourth ventricle (Figure 2B) are shown. In these animals,
the architecture of the choroid plexus appeared intact.
The three other mice showed signs of inflammation in the
choroid plexus, defined as a pathological accumulation of
immune cell infiltrates shown by H&E staining (indicated by
the circle) and also partially disrupted tissue architecture as
shown in Figure 2(C). No mice showed inflammation in any
other brain regions at this pre-onset time point.
In the spinal cord (Figure 1B), VSOP was detected in seven
out of 15 mice (46%), located in white matter and meninges.
Mild inflammatory pathology could be seen in white mat-
ter and meninges in five out of 15 mice, predominantly in
the lumbar and sacral regions, conforming to a pattern of
ascending pathology (Figure 1B). Figure 2(D) shows a repre-
sentative example of VSOP in the spinal cord meninges. As
in the choroid plexus, VSOP was seen without a pathological
accumulation of infiltrated immune cells in this area. Fig-
ure 2(E) shows an example of VSOP in a non-inflamed vessel
in the spinal cord white matter. Figure 2(F) shows VSOP in
the presence of a mild inflammatory lesion in the meninges.
As a control, we administered the same dose of VSOP to
10 unmanipulated SJL mice, and processed the tissues for
histology in an identical manner. No VSOP was detectable in
the spinal cord meninges, the choroid plexus or any other
CNS structures in these mice, suggesting that the detection
of VSOP in the pre-onset mice was related to early ­ oth-
erwise not detectable ­ inflammatory processes. In healthy
control mice, VSOP injected intravenously accumulate in the
liver and are cleared primarily by its phagocytosing systems
(Wagner et al., 2002). For all mice, liver tissue served as a
positive control for detection of VSOP (not shown). Thus, in
immunized animals and prior the appearance of clinical signs
of EAE, VSOP accumulates in spinal cord as well as the choroid
plexus and intraventricular foramen, also in the absence of
apparent inflammation.
VSOP-mediated visualization of brain
inflammation at disease peak using MRI and
histology
To better understand the involvement of choroid plexus and
spinal cord meninges in EAE development, we then examined
the distribution of VSOP at peak EAE, particularly in the
choroid plexus and in the inflamed spinal cord. EAE was
induced in SJL wild-type recipient mice by adoptive transfer
of encephalitogenic T-cells from PLP139-151
-immunized donor
mice. The typical EAE disease course expected with this model
was observed, as shown in Figure 3(A). Disease onset occurred
between 8 and 12 days after adoptive transfer of T-cells,
and peaked at days 14­16 post transfer. The distribution of
VSOP and inflammatory lesions (defined as a pathological
accumulation of immune cell infiltrates as shown by H&E
staining) is shown in Figures 3(B) and 3(C) for brain and
spinal cord, respectively. Inflammatory lesions were observed
in the thalamus and hippocampus, and less frequently in the
cortex. Lesions were especially prominent in the cerebellum
white matter tracts, and also present in cerebellar grey matter
and in the brainstem. VSOP could be detected in lesions in
all of these regions. Of particular note was the prevalence of
VSOP observed in the choroid plexus, both in the ventricles
and extending into the interventricular foramen (Figure 3B).

We observed VSOP in both mild and severe lesions. However,
we also saw both mild and severe lesions where VSOP was
absent. Thus, the presence of VSOP does not appear to be
correlated with the magnitude of the individual lesions.
The correspondence between VSOP enhancement on MRI
and histological detection was verified in 16 animals; these
mice first underwent T1- and T2*-weighted scans prior to the
application of contrast agents. After this, the mice were ad-
ministered intravenous Gd-DTPA, and scanned immediately
again by T1-weighted MRI. Subsequently, the mice were ad-
ministered intravenous VSOP, then scanned for T2*-weighted
MRI 24 h later. The 24 h time point was based on our pre-
vious studies which showed that by 24 h post-VSOP injec-
tion, the blood­pool contrast had entirely subsided, leaving
the pathological VSOP-enhancing lesions clearly discernible
(Tysiak et al., 2009; Wuerfel et al., 2007). A representative MRI
example of a mouse with severe disease (bilateral hind limb
paralysis) is shown in Figure 4(A) prior to the application of
VSOP. Hypointense lesions are visible in the cerebellum and
brainstem in the post-VSOP T2*-weighted image shown in
Figure 4(B), which are not discernable in the pre-contrast
scan in Figure 4(A). These lesions coincided with Gd-DTPA-
enhancing hyperintense lesions (Figure 4C). After the post-
VSOP MRI scanning, the mice were killed and processed for
histology. The inset in Figure 4(B) shows the histological de-
tection of VSOP in an inflammatory lesion in the cerebellar
white matter, corresponding to a lesion shown in the same
mouse by the MRI scans. Figure 4(D) shows a representa-
tive example of a healthy control mouse pre-contrast. No
hypointense or hyperintense lesions were seen in this con-
trol mouse after application of VSOP (Figure 4E) or Gd-DTPA
(Figure 4F).
Figure 5(A) shows a representative staining of VSOP in
inflamed choroid plexus, extending from the lateral ventricle
into the interventricular foramen. Note that the morphology
of the tissue structure is highly disrupted by the infiltrating
immune cells. VSOP could also be detected by MRI in choroid
plexus as hypointensities within the ventricles, as shown in
Figures 5(B) and 5(C) (coronal and axial views, respectively).
At peak of disease, numerous lesions were observed at vari-
ous stages of development. Figure 5(E) shows a representative
example of relatively mild lesions in the brain parenchyma
(thalamus). VSOP was observed in some of these lesions (ar-
row in Figure 5E), although VSOP-negative lesions were also
detected. An example of a more severe lesion with prominent
VSOP is shown in Figure 5(F). In this example, erythrocytes
can be seen in the tissue (brown colour). The observation of
both VSOP and erythrocytes in the lesion, but with differ-
ent colours, underscores the specificity of the Prussian Blue
staining method for the iron of the VSOP.
Detection of VSOP in lesions in inflamed spinal
cord
In the present study, we addressed the distribution of VSOP in
spinal cord of mice at peak EAE by histology. As depicted
in Figure 3(C), inflammatory pathology and VSOP could be
observed throughout the spinal cord. The VSOP was especially
prominent in the meninges, the anterior median fissure and
the posterior median sulcus, and in white matter lesions.
Grey matter lesions were only occasionally observed, and no
VSOP was detected in the central canal. At peak disease,
detection of VSOP in spinal cord always corresponded with
inflammatory pathology but not vice versa, i.e. inflammatory
lesions could also be seen without accompanying VSOP.

Figure 4 VSOP location in brain correlates with T2*-enhancing lesions
Representative T2*-weighted images prior to contrast agent administration are shown for EAE (A) and healthy control (D) brains.
Hypointense lesions (circles) are seen in the T2*-weighted image 24 h post-VSOP administration in the EAE brain (B) but not in the
control (E). Diffuse hyperintense Gd-DTPA-enhancing lesions are seen in representative T1-weighted images in the EAE brain (C) but
not in the healthy control (F). MRI-detected VSOP-enhancing lesions were verified by histology, showing the presence of VSOP (blue) in
inflamed lesions (inset in B). Scale bar = 1 mm.
To further dissect the VSOP distribution in sick animals,
we used immunohistochemistry combined with Prussian Blue
staining to detect VSOP in situ in relation to other cellular
and non-cellular elements in inflammatory lesions. In Fig-
ure 6(A), we show an exemplary inflammatory lesion in which
the infiltrating immune cells are restricted to the perivascular
space. Immunostaining with GFAP clearly shows the astro-
cyte end processes delineating the glia limitans surrounding
the lesion. In this example, the infiltrating cells and the VSOP
are confined to the perivascular space, and have not entered
the parenchyma of the CNS proper. Similarly, in Figure 6(B),
immunostaining with a pan-laminin antibody delineates the
vascular endothelial and the parenchymal basement mem-
branes; in this lesion, the infiltrating cells and the VSOP are
also confined to the perivascular space.
To investigate the association of VSOP with phagocytes we
did immunostaining for iba-1. In Figure 6(C), iba-1 immunos-
taining shows microglia with the typical ramified morphology
in the spinal cord parenchyma, and iba-1-positive cells co-
localized with VSOP in the inflammatory lesion. In addition
to perivascular lesions, disseminated lesions with VSOP and
immune cell infiltration into the parenchyma were seen in
both spinal cord and brain at peak disease.
Association of VSOP with endothelium in
inflammatory lesions
Apart from the detection of VSOP in perivascular lesions, in
the present study, we observed for the first time VSOP
in spinal cord inflammatory lesions as discrete puncta present
in elongated structures, which appear to be vascular en-
dothelium (solid arrow in Figure 7A). Endothelial VSOP could
be seen in close proximity to VSOP co-localized with iba-1-
positive cells in the same lesion (open arrow in Figure 7A).
VSOP was also detected in lesions as a diffuse accumulation
that did not appear to be cell-associated (arrowhead in Fig-
ure 7A). Diffuse, non-cell-associated VSOP was also seen in
the brain, as shown in the inflamed choroid plexus in the
interventricular foramen in Figure 7(B). The higher magnifi-
cation views in Figures 7(C) and 7(D) show discrete punctate
VSOP located within elongated structures which appear to be
the vascular endothelium of the choroid plexus. Additional
diffuse VSOP was seen in the choroid plexus (Figure 7C, ar-
rowhead), although it is not possible to determine whether
this non-cell-associated VSOP is located within the stroma,
given the substantial disruption of the tissue architecture
resulting from the accumulation of immune cells.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we demonstrated that VSOP accumu-
lated in the choroid plexus and spinal cord meninges of
asymptomatic mice after adoptive transfer of encephali-
togenic T-cells, prior to the onset of clinical signs and in
the absence of overt inflammation. VSOP appears to reveal
early EAE-related inflammatory alterations at the choroid
plexus explicitly. Since VSOP was completely absent from the
choroid plexus of non-immunized healthy animals without
T-cell transfer, our data point to choroid plexus involvement
not only in physiological immune surveillance and during
established CNS inflammation (Engelhardt and Ransohoff,
2005; Ransohoff et al., 2003; Reboldi et al., 2009; Vercellino

genesis of CNS autoimmunity.
VSOP detected in the choroid plexus prior to EAE onset ap-
peared as discrete foci located in the choroid plexus stroma.
In some cases the morphology of the plexus tissue remained
intact, with no obvious accumulation of infiltrating immune
cells in this early disease phase (Figures 2A and 2B), while in
other cases, mild inflammation was seen (Figure 2C). In con-
trast, the morphology of the choroid plexus at peak disease
was highly disrupted (Figures 4D and 7B­7D). It is not yet
clear which structures in the choroid plexus of the asymp-
tomatic mice are associated with VSOP. The choroid plexus
endothelium is fenestrated, which in principle could per-
mit the diffusion of free VSOP from the circulation into the
stroma. However, no VSOP was detected in the choroid plexus
(or indeed anywhere else in the CNS) of unmanipulated SJL
mice in which the same dose of VSOP was administered be-
fore processing for histology. Thus, VSOP accumulation in the
choroid plexus stroma cannot be explained by mere diffusion
mechanisms. On the other hand, VSOP could be contained
within phagocytes that had entered from the periphery at

this early EAE phase. However, we did not observe VSOP co-
localized with iba-1-positive structures in the choroid plexus
in asymptomatic animals (data not shown). Thus, mecha-
nisms other than physiological diffusion processes or early
migration of inflammatory phagocytes from the periphery
may explain VSOP accumulation in choroid plexus (Wol-
burg and Paulus, 2010). It may be that as a consequence
of the systemic inflammation induced by adoptive trans-
fer, early circulating inflammatory factors (Mitchell et al.,
2009) may alter resident myeloid cells in the choroid plexus
stroma (Nataf et al., 2006), leading to the observed accumu-
lation of VSOP in asymptomatic mice. Future studies using

additional immunohistochemical markers should address
these possibilities in detail.
Similar to the choroid plexus, VSOP was also observed in
the spinal cord meninges in pre-onset mice in the absence
of overt inflammation but not in naive mice given VSOP,
suggesting that this observation reflected early events in the
disease process. It is proposed that immune cells gain entry
to the CNS via the choroid plexus, circulate through the CSF
(cerebrospinal fluid) compartment, including the subarach-
noid space, as part of the process of immune surveillance
of the CNS, and can encounter antigen and be re-activated
in the meninges during the earliest stages of neuroinflam-
mation (Brown and Sawchenko, 2007; Reboldi et al., 2009).
Indeed, it was reported that CD4 + Th1 and Th17 cells accu-
mulate and become re-activated in the subarachnoid space
prior to entry into spinal cord parenchyma, and prior to clin-
ical onset of EAE (Kivisakk et al., 2009). The accumulation
of VSOP in the choroid plexus and spinal cord meninges at
the first stages in the disease process confirms that these
structures are altered very early during neuroinflammation.
While in asymptomatic animals VSOP highlighted the in-
volvement of choroid plexus and meninges in early inflam-
matory events, VSOP in animals at peak disease showed a
broad and heterogeneous distribution. At peak disease, VSOP
was seen in the choroid plexus in 15 out of 19 animals (79%)
and could be clearly visualized by MRI, in contrast with the
choroid plexus VSOP in asymptomatic animals which was not
detectable by MRI. Most likely this is a question of sensitiv-
ity, and work is in progress to determine the limit of detec-
tion of VSOP by MRI in vivo. One possibility to address this
would be to use MRI scanners with greater B0 field strength.
We recently reported detection of EAE lesions using a 9.4 T
MRI scanner with a cryogenically cooled coil (Waiczies et al.,
2012), and it would be interesting to apply this higher B0
field strength to studies with VSOP, to attempt to approach
the sensitivity of histological detection of VSOP in vivo. As
presented in Figures 5(A) and 7(B)­(D), the inflamed choroid
plexus has a highly disrupted morphology, consistent with
previous reports in severe EAE (Engelhardt et al., 2001; Mu-
rugesan et al., 2012).
At peak disease, we also show histological evidence for the
accumulation of VSOP in perivascular inflammatory lesions
with intact glia limitans. This type of perivascular accumu-
lation of immune cells may represent a relatively early and
potentially reversible stage in the development of a CNS le-
sion, prior to entry of the infiltrating cells into the brain
parenchyma, where they may cause tissue damage. In prin-
ciple, early detection of such lesions may be instrumental in
the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target
these distinct mechanisms and may offer the opportunity for
earlier clinical intervention (Wuerfel et al., 2008).
Moreover, in diseased mice, we observed within the same
perivascular lesion VSOP as discrete focal accumulations that
appear to be co-localized with iba-1-positive cells, as well
as diffuse VSOP accumulations which did not appear to be
cell-associated. It has been well established that iron oxide
particles are efficiently taken up by phagocytic cells (Rausch
et al., 2003, 2004; Weinstein et al., 2010). As described for
large iron oxide particles (Weinstein et al., 2010), smaller
VSOP appear also to be readily taken up by phagocytic cells
such as macrophages (Stroh et al., 2006; Fleige et al., 2002),
despite their small diameter (7 nm) (Wuerfel et al., 2007).
Uptake of VSOP by monocytes and macrophages has been
confirmed using electron microscopy (Ludwig et al., 2013).
Thus, VSOP has the potential to enter CNS tissue both as-
sociated with phagocytes and in a non-cell-associated form,
which in principle could highlight distinct aspects of the
pathological process. Furthermore, we observed for the first
time VSOP as discrete puncta that seem to be present in en-
dothelial cells. This apparent endothelial incorporation was
seen both in lesions in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma,

Involvement of choroid plexus in CNS inflammation
as well as in the choroid plexus, at peak disease. Activation
of vascular endothelium in response to inflammatory stim-
uli is associated with up-regulation of numerous adhesion
molecules, as well as extracellular matrix elements such as
hyaluronic acid (Nandi et al., 2000), which may facilitate
electrostatic interactions with VSOP. Indeed, it was recently
demonstrated that VSOP can bind strongly to cell membranes
via interactions with negatively-charged GAGs (glycosamino-
glycans) (Ludwig et al., 2013). Alteration of GAG expression
during inflammation, both in the vascular endothelium and
in the choroid plexus, may underlie interactions of VSOP in
these structure, though the specific molecular mechanisms of
such putative interactions remain to be investigated in future
studies, including the use of in vitro BBB and BCSFB (blood­
CSF barrier) model systems. Additionally, work is in progress
to employ a SQUID (superconducting quantum interference
device) to precisely measure iron content by magnetorelax-
ometry in tissues ex vivo, after application of VSOP (Eberbeck
et al., 2008; Richter et al., 2010). The use of SQUID will en-
able a quantitative determination of the distribution of VSOP
to various tissue compartments, which can be compared be-
tween healthy controls and EAE mice at different time points
during disease.
One caveat of the present study is the lack of an estab-
lished fluorescent method for histological detection of iron,
which precludes the use of confocal microscopy to defini-
tively establish cellular co-localization and internalization of
VSOP. Work is in progress to circumvent this limitation by
the development of next generation VSOP that incorporate
europium atoms directly into the iron oxide core. This renders
the particles detectable by both MRI and fluorescence (Gro-
man et al., 2007), and will permit future studies to make more
conclusive statements regarding cellular and extracellular lo-
calization in vivo. In particular, immunostaining with specific
markers for endothelial cells and phagocytic cells combined
with fluorescent VSOP will facilitate corroboration of our ini-
tial findings for VSOP in the endothelium and choroid plexus,
respectively.
In summary, in the present study, using VSOP, we demon-
strated that apart from its involvement in immune surveil-
lance, the choroid plexus is involved in early inflammatory
processes in autoimmune inflammation. It seems to undergo
alterations occurring very early in the process of inflamma-
tion that enables the specific binding of VSOP to stromal
structures of the choroid plexus. On the other hand, in es-
tablished EAE, we show accumulation of VSOP both in CNS
perivascular lesions and associated with endothelial cells, two
processes which may represent an early stage in the patho-
logical cascade in EAE. Thus, VSOP may emerge as a use-
ful complement to conventional MRI approaches to monitor
early cellular changes in the context of inflammation. VSOP
has already been applied in human clinical studies in the con-
text of MR angiography (Taupitz et al., 2004; Wagner et al.,
2011). It is therefore essential that we expand our under-
standing of how these particles interact with cellular and
non-cellular elements in vivo. Importantly, the use of VSOP
will help improve our understanding of the pathomechanisms
in multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory disorders of the
CNS.
