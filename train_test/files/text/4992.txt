Introduction
Background to the Study
Translation is undoubtedly a tool of communication as it
removes the barriers between any two languages. However,
to achieve fruitful communication between any two differ-
ent linguistic codes, full command of the two languages is
required: the source language (SL) and the target language
(TL). The absence of such understanding would pose quan-
daries in transferring the intended meaning from one lan-
guage to another; consequently, ineluctable losses could
occur. Thus, any translation process should ensure that the
target text (TT) presents the key elements of the source text
(ST) by incorporating it well into the incipient product to
produce the same effect as was intended by the ST. One such
significant motivation for the translation of the Holy Qur'an
into another language such as English is the fact that many
Muslims do not speak Arabic, and, thus, the need for schol-
ars to translate the Holy Qur'an to communicate its message
to Muslims all over the world is paramount (Mohammed,
2005). However, for a text such as the Holy Qur'an, which
conveys the words ofAllah theAlmighty, translating it poses
lots of difficulties and quandaries for translators.
Statement of the Problem
One of the difficulties in translating the Holy Qur'an is that
some lexicons are Qur'an specific, and they do not have
equivalents in English. For example, the Qur'anic word 
[tayammamoo1] does not have an equivalent word in English
(Khalaf & Y
usoff, 2012). Thus, when an attempt is made to
translate this word into English, its original meaning could
be lost. Another thing is that there are some deviations and
undertranslations as a result of not referring to the interpreta-
tions of the Holy Qur'an, lack of understanding of Arabic

Semantic Loss in the Holy Qur'an
Translation With Special Reference to
Surah Al-WaqiAAa (Chapter of The Event
Inevitable)
Noureldin Mohamed Abdelaal1 and Sabariah Md Rashid1
Abstract
Semantic loss, which refers to over-, under-, or mistranslation of a source text (ST), may result in partial or complete loss
of meaning in the target text (TT). This phenomenon is prevalent in the translations of an ST, especially translations of the
Holy Qur'an due to factors such as the lack of equivalence of some cultural words in the target language (TL). In relation to
this, translators of this holy book have been critiqued for their inability to completely convey the true and accurate meanings
of the Holy Qur'an. This study attempted to investigate the semantic loss in the translation of the Surah al-WaqiAAa by
Abdullah Yusuf Ali. It also examined the frequency and causes of such losses. This research, which is qualitative in nature,
utilized descriptive content analysis of the Surah. The translation of the ayat [verses] related to the problem of the research
has been extracted from the work of Abdullah Yusuf Ali, The Holy Qur'an: Text and Translation. The meanings of the translated
verses were verified by two Arabic language experts who had mastered English as well. The causes of losses were identified
according to Baker's typology. The findings showed frequent partial and complete semantic loss of meanings mostly due to
mistranslations, semantic complexity of the vocabularies, and culture.

linguistics, and inability to decode and convey the nuances
of polysemous words (Abdul-Raof, 2004; alQinai, 2011).
In relation to this research, some previous research was
conducted to address the phenomenon of deviations, such as
semantic loss in some verses (Ali, Brakhw, Nordin, & Ismail,
2012; Fathi & Nasser, 2009). However, such research tended
to focus on the semantic loss in only certain verses from dif-
ferent chapters. To date, little is known about the semantic
loss in English translations of complete chapters. Thus, there
is a need for further research to investigate such types of
semantic losses in the translation of certain chapters in the
Holy Qur'an. In addition, Surah al-WaqiAAa has not been
examined from this perspective. Therefore, the proposed
research sought to examine the types of semantic losses in
the English translation of this Surah byAbdullah Y
usufAli.
Research Objectives
Specifically, the present research sought to (a) examine
semantic loss in the English translation of Surah al-WaqiAAa
and the types of these losses and (b) identify the causes of the
identified semantic losses. In the context of this research, the
term losses refers to two senses. In the general sense, it refers
to the partial or complete loss of any verbal sign (e.g., word,
phrase, sentence); while in its specific sense, the term refers
to losses affecting the interpretation of these verbal signs on
the semantic level (Al-Masri, 2009). Such losses can reduce
or negatively affect the ways by which target readers under-
stand the TT.
Literature Review
The semantic relationship between words in two different
languages does not correspond to one-to-one sets or even
one-to-many sets; in addition, there are a lot of fuzziness,
obscurity, and ambiguity in the boundaries between any
two languages (Nida, 1994). Because of these complicated
boundaries between languages, translators face the challenge
of losing meaning in their TTs. The TL's linguistic system
cannot represent a lot of meanings in the SL. For example,
the grammar of English sometimes does not have plural
forms of words in which plurality makes a big difference in
meaning (Abdul-Raof, 2004).
In Arabic, the words  [alriah] and [alreeh]
"wind" have two contrasting meanings; the first plural
word expresses blessing whereas the singular expresses
punishment.
In translation, semantic loss may occur due to those dif-
ferences of mapping vocabularies in different languages.
Languages map words in different ways; a concept that can
be expressed by just one word in English may be expressed
by many words in another language. For example, in English,
table can be rendered into different lexemes in the Polish lan-
guage (Ameel, Malt, Storms, & V
anAssche, 2009). This also
occurs in Arabic frequently. The English word cup can be
rendered into diverse lexemes inArabic with different shades
of meaning. In particular, in Arabic and the Qur'anic lan-
guage, the word cup may mean  [ka/as],  [koub], and
 [ibreeq]. Such a gap of mapping vocabularies results in
difficulty in translation, and, hence, loss is likely to occur.
Semantic losses, cultural losses or inequivalences, can
result from overlooking the literariness or figurativeness of
the ST. Translators sometimes do not observe the figures of
speech or rhetorical devices in the SL. Besides, they some-
times have problems in observing the symbolic level, and, as
a result, a loss in literary translation occurs (Al-Masri, 2009).
This also applies to the Holy Qur'an whose language is more
sophisticated than literary texts.
Problems in translation that lead to semantic loss may fall
into two broad types: linguistic (semantic and syntactic) and
cultural. Those semantic problems can include lexical and
morphological problems.
Lexical Problems in Translation
Lexical and morphological problems are among the promi-
nent problems in translation. These may include synonymy,
polysemy and homonymy, lexical gaps, and collocations.
Synonymy
Synonymy, a lexical relationship term used to refer to the
sameness of meaning (Lobner, 2002; Palmer, 1976/1981),
has been identified as one of the troubles in translation from
Arabic into English. Shunnaq (1992) states that translating
cognitive synonyms2 is confusing due to the slight differ-
ences between these synonyms. Hence, a good criterion can
be the intuition of a native Arabic speaker who is able to
judge such differences better. For example, the slight dif-
ference between  [yaghbit] and  [yahsud] cannot be
realized without having intuitive and deep knowledge of the
differences between synonyms in Arabic. As a result, trans-
lators may use "envy" as an equivalent for both, though it
is completely divergent from the real meaning because the
first word,  [yaghbit], has a positive implication, whereas
the latter word,  [yahsud], has a negative implication
(Shehab, 2009).
Synonyms, in a religious context such as the Holy Qur'an,
are a more intricate issue. The Holy Qur'an language is the
most eloquent language among the different Arabic dialects.
Translators sometimes render some words as synonyms,
though they are not. Translating what look to be synonymous
verbs is also problematic. Arberry3 considered  [yahlif]
and  [yuqsim] as synonyms, and he translated them as
"swear." In Arabic, the two verbs have different implica-
tions. The verb  [yahlif] is used in the Holy Qur'an to
refer to hypocrites and disbelievers, which means breaking
the oath; the verb  [yuqsim] is utilized in the Holy Qur'an
to refer to believers who fulfill their promises and oaths
(Shehab, 2009).
Abdelaal and Md Rashid 3
Similar to the problems above, Abdul-Raof (2005) dis-
cussed some problems that translators faced and sometimes
failed to overcome. He mentioned that semantic void is one
of the prevalent difficulties faced by translators, which is
caused by the inability to differentiate in meaning between
cognitive synonyms. Consider the following example from
Surah alAAmran:
(3:3(  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
    

  
  
  
) 
[Nazzala AAalayka alkitaba bialhaqqi musaddiqan lima bayna
yadayhi waanzala alttawrata waal-injeela]
Arberry (1996) translates this verse as follows: "He has sent
down upon thee the Book with the truth, confirming what was
before it, and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel" (p. 73).
In this verse,Arberry translated the two verb words ""
[nazzala] and "" [anzala] as "send down," as if the two
words were synonyms. However, in Arabic, they have dif-
ferent senses; the first lexicon "" [nazzala] signifies the
piecemeal revelation of the Holy Qur'an over 23 years.
In contrast, the second lexicon "" [anzala] signifies to
reveal (the gospel and Torah) at one instance. Hence, in this
case, the translator has failed to show the nuances between
the two words (Abdul-Raof, 2005).
Another problem in the use of synonyms is the collocated
cognitive synonyms. These synonymous words, which come
together for both emphasis and stylistic or aesthetic purposes,
are referred to as collocated synonyms. The second synonym
is usually used to add beauty to the text or to create rhythm
(Shehab, 2009). Translating those synonyms cannot be done
by translators, and when translated, they look redundant
(Shehab, 2009). For example, the English noun "despair"
may be translated as   [qoonootun wa ya/s]. The two
Arabic words (i.e.,  [qoonoot] and  [ya/s]) are syn-
onyms; however, the second synonym (i.e., ) was used to
add beauty to the translation (Shehab, 2009).
In sum,Arabic, unlike English, is rich with synonyms. For
example, Al-ssyuti (2008) states that there are 41 synonyms
for the word "" [alssaif] "the sword" and 8 synonyms
for the word  [alaAAsl] "honey." Richness of synony-
mous vocabularies in the Arabic language, in general, and
the Qur'anic language, in particular, poses difficulties for a
translator as he may use one synonym in lieu of another that
is more accurate.
Polysemy and Homonymy
There are two views regarding lexical ambiguity: that words
have their lexical ambiguity prior to their semantic occur-
rence inside a text or that lexical ambiguity is context depen-
dent, and this means it occurs due to the effect of the text
(Simpson, 1981). Homonymy and polysemy are two of the
main causes of lexical ambiguity. Homonymy refers to this
sense relationship when two words have the same spelling but
different meanings (Crystal, 1991). A classical example for
homonymy is the word bank as a financial institution, which
is defined by Collins (2006) CoBuild Advanced Learner'
s
English Dictionary as ". . . an institution where people or
businesses keep their money" (p. 97), or the bank of a river,
which is defined by Collins CoBuild Advanced Learner's
English Dictionary as ". . . the raised areas of ground along its
[river] edge" (p. 98). Polysemy, on the contrary, refers to mul-
tiplicity of meanings as when a word is used in different fields
with different meanings (alQinai, 2011; Geeraerts, 2010).
Lexical ambiguity is very common in language as a sin-
gle string of words may lead to more than one interpreta-
tion because one of the words has more than one meaning
(Klepousniotou, 2001; Simpson, 1981). In addition, poly-
semy can be confused with homonymy if two words with the
same spelling or pronunciation have two different meanings.
According to the generative lexicon approach, homonymy
occurs when distinct senses are stored separately, whereas
polysemy occurs only when the basic meaning is stored in
the lexical repertoire of the person (Klepousniotou, 2001).
Put simply, polysemy refers to multiplicity of meanings as
when a word is used in different fields with different mean-
ings (Geeraerts, 2010). For example, the word  [aAAin]
has a lot of meanings in Arabic such as   [aAAinu
alssawab] and   [aAAinu alhaqeeqah], which mean
completely right, and  [aAAinu alibrah], which
means the eye of a needle. It can also mean a spy, among
other meanings. Thus, they are polysemes because they have
the same etymological root (Sadiq, 2008). Such a kind of
polysemy might create ambiguity for a translator.
In relation to the Holy Qur'an, polysemy is one of its
linguistic features. For instance, the word  [ummah] has
nine polysemic meanings in the Holy Qur'an. It may mean
a period of time as in Surah Ysuf (V
erse 45) or a religious
leader who leads people to the right path as in Surah AlNnahl
(V
erse 120). Many translators fail to pick the correct mean-
ing; hence, they render it incorrectly (Ali et al., 2012).
Consider the following example:

  
 
 
 
  
      

 
  
 

(16:120)
[Inna ibraheema kana ommatan qanitan lillahi haneefan walam
yaku mina almushrikeena]
Arberry (1996) translates this verse as follows: "Surely,
Abraham was a nation obedient unto God, a man of pure faith
and no idolater" (p. 300). Abdullah Y
usuf Ali (1938/1968)
also translates this verse as follows: "Abraham was indeed
a model, devoutly obedient to Allah, (and) true in Faith, and
he joined not gods with Allah" (pp. 2156-2157). Considering
these translations, we find Arberry's translation is out of con-
text. He translated the word  [ummah] as "nation," which
is not the correct sense in this context. The words  [ummah]
here refers to being an Islamic good example who teaches peo-
ple their religion, and who has a great deal of faith and piety

like Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Another example
given by (Sadiq, 2008) is the Qur'anic verb  [daAAa] in
the following verses where it has different shades of meaning.
(3:38) 
    
 
 
 
  
  
 
    
  
 
  

  

[Hunalika daAAa zakariyya rabbahu qala rabbi hab lee min
ladunka thurriyyatan tayyibatan innaka sameeAAu aldduAAa]
Pickthall (1956) translates this verse as follows: "Then
Zachariah prayed unto his Lord and said: My Lord! Bestow
upon me of Thy bounty goodly offspring. Lo! Thou art the
Hearer of Prayer" (p. 36).

itha daAAakum lima yuhyeekum waiAAlamoo anna Allaha
yahoolu bayna almar-i waqalbihi waannahu ilayhi tuhsharoona]
Pickthall (1956) translates this verse as follows:
O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and the messenger when He
calleth you to that which quickeneth you, and know that Allah
cometh in between the man and his own heart, and that He it is
unto Whom ye will be gathered. (p. 125)

Pickthall (1956) translates this verse as follows:
O Ye who believe! Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet for a
meal without waiting for the proper time, unless permission be
granted you. But if ye are invited, enter, and, when your meal
is ended, then disperse. Linger not for conversation. Lo! that
would cause annoyance to the Prophet, and he would be shy
of (asking) you (to go); but Allah is not shy of the truth. And
when ye ask of them (the wives of the Prophet) anything, ask
it of them from behind a curtain. That is purer for your hearts
and for their hearts. And it is not for you to cause annoyance
to the messenger of Allah, nor that ye should ever marry his
wives after him. Lo! that inAllah's sight would be an enormity.
(p. 342)
The verb  [da'aa] in these three verses is polysemic; it
has three related meanings. In the first verse (3:38), it means
"invoke"; in the second (8:24), it means "call"; and in the third
(33:53), it means "invite" (Sadiq, 2010, p. 27). Hence, an inex-
perienced translator may fall in the trap of using one form with
those different senses or shades of meaning (Sadiq, 2010).
Theoretical Framework
Translation is the process of communicating a meaning in a ST
through a means of an equivalent TT. Theories of translation
have always tended to revolve around the two poles of "literal"
(or word-for-word) and "free" (or sense-for-sense) translation
(citation needed). The concept of "equivalence" has always
been a topic of discussion among different scholars of transla-
tion (Munday, 2001). The concept of "equivalence" has always
been a topic of discussion among different scholars of trans-
lation (Baker, 2004)). Literature is abundant with translation
theories such as Newmark's (1981, 1988) theory, Nida's (1991)
theory, and Baker's (1992) typology. This research is basically
based on Baker's typology of equivalence between English and
Arabic. This theory or typology was selected because it is the
most relevant theory. It discusses exhaustively the non-equiva-
lence problem at different levels. It also points out the equiva-
lence problems between English and Arabic. Baker (1992)
believes that the concept of "equivalence" is relative because it
is affected by many linguistic and cultural factors. She adopts
a neutral approach in her notion of equivalence (Panou, 2013).
Equivalence at Word Level (Baker's Typology)
As mentioned earlier, Baker (1992) discussed equivalence at
the different levels; however, this research refers to the equiv-
alence and non-equivalence at the word level. According to
Baker (1992), it is important to distinguish between lexi-
cal items and units of meaning to achieve good translation.
Meanings, furthermore, differ in the orthographic words that
represent them from one language to another. For example,
the meaning of one orthographic word in one language may
be represented by several orthographic words in another lan-
guage and vice versa. For instance, "" [alreeh] and ""
[alriaah], in Arabic, have only one equivalent representation
in English, namely wind. Consequently, there is no one-to-one
correspondence between orthographic words and elements of
meaning within or across languages. Baker categorizes non-
equivalence at the word level into 11 types; however, in the
context of the current research only 8 types are discussed:
1. Culture-specific terms and concepts in the two lan-
guages: Such culture-specific terms may include
Islamic terms and concepts. For example, the word
Abdelaal and Md Rashid 5
 [salah] does not have equivalent in English. The
Arabic word  [salah] refers to praying to Allah
Almighty 5 times a day in certain way preceded by
making ablution  [wudu'aa]. Another example
of such culture-specific terms may include Arabic
customs, food, and social life; for example, 
[alssabiAA], which does not have an equivalent
term in English. The Arabic word  [alssabiAA]
refers to a custom in Egypt, whereby the family of
the bride visit their daughter in her husband's house
after approximately 7 days, taking with them some
food.
2. Arabic terms that are not lexicalized in English like
the word  [yatawra], which can be represented
by a phrase but not a single word; that is, to hide from
people. Y
et, this paraphrase does not imply the full
meaning of the word.
3. Arabic words that are semantically complex. For
instance, the word  [ghusl], which refers to tak-
ing a bath after ejaculation or having intimate rela-
tionship with a wife. This bath is recommended to be
preceded by ablution  [wudu'aa].
4. Arabic and English make different distinctions in
meaning. For example, the plurality in the Holy
Qur'an does not serve only for a grammatical pur-
pose; it adds extra meaning that sometimes gives the
opposite connotations. TheArabic word  [alreeh]
"wind," which is singular, has punishment meaning.
Whereas the second word  [alriah], which is
plural, has a blessing and bounty meaning.
5. English lacks a specific term (hyponym). For exam-
ple, anArabic lexical item may have many hyponyms,
whereas the English linguistic system does not have
equivalent lexical items for theArabic hyponyms.
6. English lacks specific terms (superordinate).
7. Differences between Arabic and English in expres-
sive meaning.
8. Differences in form.
Method
Research Design
This research employed a descriptive qualitative approach;
specifically the content analysis type of the qualitative
research. This approach requires written language that the
researcher examines, to identify the losses in meaning and
the causes behind them. Besides this, this research does not
depend on quantities or numbers. Strauss and Corbin (1990)
define qualitative research as the one that refers to any kind
of research that produces findings that are not attained by
means of statistical procedures or other means of quantifica-
tion, and instead, the kind of research that produces findings
arrived from real-world settings where the interest area is
pronounced naturally (Patton, 2002).
Sampling
In this research, Ali's English translation of Surah al-
WaqiAAa constitutes the data of the research. The transla-
tion was extracted from the work of Abdullah Y
usuf Ali
(1938/1968): "The Holy Qur'an: Text and Translation." This
research employs purposive sampling as the selected data
were elicited based on the research objectives. Purposive
sampling is the sampling based on selecting samples for a
defined purpose, and this kind of sampling increases trans-
ferability (Teddlie & Y
u, 2007). The focus was only on the
translated verses of Surah al-WaqiAAa that show semantic
loss. According to the literature (e.g., Patton, 1990), quali-
tative inquiry focuses in depth on somewhat small sam-
ples. However, these samples should be purposeful ones.
Purposeful sampling refers to selecting information- rich
cases (Patton, 1990).
Data Collection Procedures
Data collection in a qualitative research may include obser-
vations of targeted events, focus group interviews and the
examination of documents and artifacts (Sandelowski,
2000). In relation to this research, the English text of the Holy
Qur'an translation of Y
usuf Ali was collected for analysis
purpose. The data collection involved several steps: First, the
Surah al-WaqiAAa and its interpretation (tafsir) in the exege-
sis books such as Ibn Kathir (1995/2005),Alt-Tabari (2003),
and Sayid Qutb (2006) tafsir were identified followed by the
identification of the matching translation of Surah al-Waq-
iAAa by Y
usuf Ali in Ali's (1938/1968) seminal work "The
Holy Qur'an: Translation and Commentary." After that, the
translation was examined to understand the lexical meanings
of the verses. Finally, a comparison of the lexical meanings
in the translation and the authentic meanings in the exegesis
books, and the Arabic monolingual dictionaries, such as Al
MoAAjam al-Waseet (Mustafa, Az-Zayyat, Abdel Qader, &
An-Najjar, 2004), was made.
Data Analysis
The content analysis approach has been used in this study.
Altheide (1987) and Morgan (1993) state that qualitative
content analysis is a strategy of choice in qualitative descrip-
tive studies, which is a dynamic form of analysis of verbal
and visual data that is oriented toward summarizing the
informational contents of these data. Qualitative content
analysis is data driven; that is, codes are not only system-
atically applied, but they were also generated from the data
themselves in the course (Sandelowski, 2000).
Subsequently, the researcher used interpretation books
as a reference for examining the authentic meanings of the
verses under study and identifying the semantic losses.
Interpretation books such as Tafsir ibni Kathir (1995/2002),
6 SAGE Open
Tafsir Alt-Tabari (2003), Tafsir al Qurtubi (AlQurtubi,
2004), and Tafsir Sayid Qutb (2006), Tafsir alzzamakhshari
(Al-Kash-shaaf; 1407 A.H) were used as the main exegesis
books to examine the interpretation of the verses. In addition,
different related articles and books were used to support the
findings of the research. Books of heritage were also referred
to, such as "alMufradat fi Ghareeb Al Qur'an" "Strange
V
ocabularies in the Holy Qur'an" by Al-Asfahani (n.d.).
Dictionaries such as Collins CoBuild Advanced Learner's
English Dictionary and Cambridge Advanced Dictionary
were used to check the meanings of lexicons in the trans-
lations. Moreover, two experts4 of Arabic language who are
proficient in English participated in the verification of the
selected data.
Results and Discussion
The analysis of the data revealed that the extent of semantic
losses in the English translation of Surah al-WaqiAAa can be
either complete or partial. These losses occur due to using
words that are not proper in their respective semantic fields
(shift in meaning). More details about these losses are dis-
cussed in the following sections.
Partial or Complete Loss
Complete losses are the losses that change the meaning
or give an opposite one. However, partial losses are those
losses in which the message of the ST is partially conveyed.
Examining the verses under study carefully, it can be seen
that the verses sometimes show partial loss of meaning;
while, sometimes, they show complete loss of meaning.
Mostly, the over dominant type of loss is the partial one. For
example, in the first verse (see Table 1, Sample 1), there is a
complete loss because the meaning of the Day of Judgment
cannot be conveyed by words such as "event" or "comes to
pass." The meaning of the ST word is very effective and has
a strong effect on the ears of native speakers of Arabic. An
example of partial loss is V
erse 13 (Sample 3) as the meaning
has been conveyed, but not accurately.
Semantic Losses (Shift in Meaning)
The shift in meaning that results from using a word that is
not proper in a semantic field is one of the common types
of losses in Ali's translation of the Surah. A semantic field
denotes a segment of reality symbolized by a set of related
words. These words in a semantic field share a common
semantic property (Brinton, 2000). Hence, many words can
share shades of meaning, but they do have differences in
their denotations as well as their connotations. As a result,
translators sometimes choose one word, while the other one
is the more precise option. Table 1 shows examples of such a
kind of losses in the Surah.
From Table 1, it can be seen that the translator tends to
use vocabularies that do not convey the intended meaning.
For example, the first verse (Sample 1) was translated as fol-
lows: "When the Event inevitable cometh to pass." In this
verse, " 
" alwaqiAAat was translated as "the event inevi-
table," and this is not proper because the two words are not
equivalent. The English word event refers to "something that
happens, especially when it is unusual or important" (Collins
CoBuild Advanced Learner's English Dictionary, 2006,
p.485), while the Arabic Qur'anic word is one of the names
of the Day of Judgment; there could be huge number of
events, but there will be no more than one Day of Judgment.
The verse refers to the occurrence of the Day of Judgment
(Ibn Kathir, 1995/2002, p. 514) and not merely an important
event as the translation implies. In addition, the translation
does not convey the meaning that is intuitively realized by a
native speaker ofArabic.The literal meaning of the word refers
to something that falls from a high point and then becomes
still (Qutb, 2006). This word is always used to refer to hard
situations and punishment; for example, another verse goes
as "   " [Saala sa-ilun biAAathabin waqiAAin]
"A questioner asked about a Penalty to befall" (70:1; Y
usuf
Ali's translation). Hence, the drift of the Arabic word, in this
context, refers to punishment (Al-Asfahani, n.d.). Moreover,
"comes to pass" is a feeble translation of the word  [waqa-
AAati], which in its authentic SL means "to occur" or "fall,"
and it refers to something prodigious (Al-Waseet Dictionary, p.
1050). In this context of translation, the expressive meaning

is lost, as well. In addition, one ST verb was translated into
three words, which makes the translation unfaithful to the ST.
It reflects an overtranslation. The translation of such verse
conveys a complete loss of meaning, as it is not imagined
that a non-native speaker ofArabic perceives the meaning of
the ST out of the translation. In addition, the expressive and
connotative meanings are lost in the translation.
In the second sample (V
erse 7), the English word classes
was used to render "" [azwajan]. This rendition is not
accurate. The word class, according to the Cambridge Online
Advanced Learner'
s Dictionary, means "people who share
rank," but the ST word does not mean that; it means that peo-
ple will be grouped, but with different ranks inside. In other
words, people will not share the same rank, as the translation
implies. "Groups" could have expressed the meaning better
than "classes." This loss of meaning in translating the verse
is partial because the general meaning is partially conveyed.
Sample 3 (V
erse 13) shows a semantic loss in the transla-
tion as "a number of people from those of old." The selection
of lexemes is inaccurate because "a number" implies "sev-
eral," as suggested by Collins CoBuild Advanced Learner's
English Dictionary, though, according to Makhlouf (1995,
p. 324), "" [Thullatun] means "a huge number or throng."
Moreover, the English word old does not completely con-
vey the meaning of the verse, which according to Alt-Tabari
(2003) and Ibn Kathir (1995/2002, p. 518) refers to the first
generations of Muslims. The translation of the verse resulted
in complete loss of meaning, as the denotative and connota-
tive meanings of the verse are not conveyed in the translation.
Similarly, in the fourth example (V
erse 22), the transla-
tion of " 
  
" [hoorun AAeen] as "And (there will be)
Companions with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes,-" does not
tend to be accurate. This translation does not fit in the authen-
tic meaning because the translation gives only description to
the eyes disregarding the other beauties. One aspect of the
shades of meaning was expressed, but the other secondary
senses were lost. The " 
  
" [hoorun AAeen] expression
is a culturally bound term that does not have an equivalent
in English. The translator should have better transliterated or
paraphrased it instead of creating a partial loss of meaning.
Another example that illustrates such type of loss is V
erse
25 (Sample 5), which was translated as "not frivolity will
they hear therein, nor any taint of ill." This translation is far
from being accurate. The Qur'anic word "" [ta/theeman]
was translated as "taint of ill." This translation is not accurate
because "" [ta/theeman] is something which causes sin
(Ibn Kathir, 1995/2002), while "taint of ill" does not convey
such a meaning accurately.A"sinful talk" could have been a
better translation. The translation of this verse echoes partial
loss of meaning.
Likewise, V
erse 34 (Sample 6) was rendered as "And on
Thrones (of Dignity), raised high." The Arabic word " 
"
[furushin], in this context, does not mean "thrones"; it refers
to the stuff put on beds for sleeping, and in this context, as
Alt-Tabari (2003) stated, it can refer to the women of Jannah.
Moreover, the verse has denotative and connotative mean-
ings that are lost in translation. Connotatively, it means
high-ranked women, with the best attributes. Partial loss of
meaning is created in the translation of this verse.
Unsurprisingly, in V
erse 37 (Sample. 7), "" [AAuruban]
was rendered as "Beloved (by nature)"; it shows a complete
loss of meaning because the authentic meaning of the word is
women who approach their husbands with sweet words and
playful actions (Ibn Kathir, 1995/2002). The word is a cultur-
ally bound term, so translation is not possible here. Besides,
the rendition of the Qur'anic word into the two-word term
being beloved does not imply that these women of Jannah
will love their husbands or attempt to be emotionally closer
to them employing sweet words. All these shades of mean-
ing are essential and should not be avoided. Besides, they are
understood by native speakers of Arabic whenever they read
theArabic Qur'anic text. Likewise, in V
erse 5 (Sample 8), the
translation was neither faithful nor economical to the ST, as
"   " [Wabussati aljibalu bassan] was rendered to
"crumbled to atoms."According to al-Al Asfahani5 (n.d.), the
verse means "to be ground to flour" (p. 58). There is a clear
shift in meaning here.
These findings, indeed, are similar to the findings of
Shehab (2009) and Shunnaq (1992) that highlighted the
problem of selecting the proper synonym. A translator,
sometimes, is misled by the many synonyms of the ST, and
he, accordingly, selects the improper word. These findings
are also in line with those of Abu-Mahfouz (2011), in which
he referred to how translators select a certain lexeme when
the other one is the correct and accurate option. The Qur'anic
text is accurate, complex, and pregnant with meanings, so
translators should be attentive and sensitive to the language
options in the TL.
Causes of Semantic Loss
Following Baker's typology of non-equivalence at the word
level, the following causes of losses were identified.
Culturally bound terms.Culturally bound terms are some of
the prominent problems of equivalence in the process of
translation. Culture is the umbrella that most of the other
semantic problems fall under. In the V
erse 1 (Sample 1),
for instance, the translation failed to find an equivalence to
the words "" [alwaqiAAatu] and "" [waqaAAati],
respectively, because they are culturally bound concepts that
do not have equivalents in English; they are purely Islamic
religion terms. Likewise, in the V
erse 22 (Sample 4), the
translation failed to convey the complete meaning of " 


" [hoorun AAeenun] because it is a cultural concept that
can only be found in the Holy Qur'an.
Lack of lexicalization.Another cause of semantic loss, as
stated by Baker (1992), is the case when the Arabic terms
are not lexicalized in the English language. An example of
8 SAGE Open
lack of lexicalization in the TL is the Verse 5 (Sample 8), in
which the translation attempted to convey the meaning by
using paraphrase as a strategy.
Semantically complex words.Furthermore, Baker (1992) men-
tions another cause of problems of equivalence in transla-
tion, namely, Arabic words that are semantically complex;
for example, in the V
erse 25 (Sample 5), the words ""
[laghuan] and "" [ta/theeman] are semantically complex
words. They cannot be rendered in single words. Another
clear example of the semantic complexity is the words ""
[AAuruban] and "" [attraban], which cannot be trans-
lated in stand-alone words. The words "" [AAuruban]
and "" [atraban] in V
erse 37 (Sample 7) are semanti-
cally complex; they cannot be translated into one-word
equivalents.
Mistranslation losses.Lossessometimesoccurduetomistrans-
lating the verses; either because the translator has not read
thoroughly through the exegesis books or because of lack of
mastery of the authentic SL. In relation to this research, the
translator (i.e., Y
usuf Ali) is a non-Arab Muslim, so he tends
sometimes to select words that are not accurate or equivalent
in meaning though sometimes the equivalents exist.
In the data analysis section, it was found that the transla-
tor failed to select the proper words. In the V
erses 1 (Sample
1) and 7 (Sample 2), the translator could have selected
more proper words in the respective semantic fields, but he
rendered the translation with loss of meaning due to inap-
propriate selection of words. For example, "fall" could
have expressed the meaning better in V
erse 1 than "occur."
Similarly, "groups" could have expressed the meaning better
than "classes" in V
erse 7.
Conclusion
This research has revealed that semantic loss in the English
translation of Surah al-WaqiAAa exists. The loss occurs
either completely or partially. However, partial loss tends to
be more common than the complete loss. In addition, trans-
lators, sometimes, select words that are improper in their
semantic fields. Such inaccuracy of selected vocabulary
leads to a shift in meaning. Many non-equivalence problems
were as causes for the semantic losses found in the trans-
lation of the Surah al-WaqiAAa in the translation by Y
usuf
Ali. This research revealed that semantic loss occurs mainly
because of cultural gaps; the Qur'anic language has its own
lexicons that are culturally bound.Another cause is the trans-
lator's relatively poor knowledge of the sciences of the Holy
Qur'an. In this light, many approaches of translation such
as literal translation and communicative or semantic transla-
tion have been used by translators. However, the former (lit-
eral translation approach) has been rejected because the Holy
Qur'an cannot be translated literally, and the latter creates loss
of meaning. Thus, in view of the complexities of the message
conveyed in the Qur'an, it seems reasonable to state that the
only acceptable translation is the exegetical translation; one
that is based on exegesis books, which will guide a trans-
lator in attaining accurate meaning of the TT. Without full
knowledge of the exegesis books, a translator will inevitably
fail in translating the Holy Qur'an. In addition, translation
of the Holy Qur'an should be carried out by a team of schol-
ars, who are experts in the different branches of knowledge
related to the Holy Qur'an.
