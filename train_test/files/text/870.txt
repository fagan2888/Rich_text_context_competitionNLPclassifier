Association of Diabetes, Serum Insulin, and C-Peptide
With Gallbladder Disease

An inconsistent association has been found between
gallbladder disease and diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized
that insulin resistance rather than diabetes status may be a
primary factor involved in gallstone formation. A total of 5,653
adult participants in the third United States National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey without known diabetes
underwent gallbladder ultrasonography and phlebotomy
after an overnight fast for measurement of serum insulin,
C-peptide, and glucose. Gallbladder disease was defined as
ultrasound-documented gallstones or evidence of cholecys-
tectomy. Subjects were characterized as having normal fasting
glucose (F110 mg/dL), impaired fasting glucose (110 to
F126 mg/dL), or undiagnosed diabetes (H126 mg/dL).
After controlling for other known gallbladder disease risk
factors, among women, undiagnosed diabetes was associ-
ated with increased risk of gallbladder disease (prevalence
ratio [PR]  1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]  1.29-2.83);
whereas impaired fasting glucose was unassociated. Gall-
bladder disease risk in women increased with levels of
fasting insulin (PR  1.63, 95% CI  1.11-2.40) and C-pep-
tide (PR  2.07, 95% CI  1.32-3.25) comparing highest to
lowest quintiles. However, the association of gallbladder
disease with undiagnosed diabetes was not diminished
when the model included fasting insulin (PR  1.85, 95%
CI  1.24-2.77). In men, there was a statistically nonsignifi-
cant association with undiagnosed diabetes (PR  2.11,
95% CI  0.76-5.85), but no association of gallbladder
disease with insulin or C-peptide. Among women higher
fasting serum insulin levels increased the risk of gallbladder
disease, but did not account for the increased risk in
persons with diabetes. (HEPATOLOGY 2000;31:299-303.)
Gallbladder disease is a common condition affecting more
than 20 million persons in the United States.1 Despite its
common occurrence and impact, risk factors for gallbladder
disease are incompletely understood. An association of oral
cholecystography or ultrasound-documented gallbladder dis-
ease with diabetes mellitus was found in some2-8 but not
all9-11 population-based epidemiological studies, and the
strength of its association varied markedly across studies.
Although the negative findings of some studies may have
been because of limitations in design or statistical power,
another possible explanation for this variation is that the
insulin resistance that characterizes most persons who de-
velop non­insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may be a
primary factor involved in gallstone formation. A role for
insulin in gallbladder disease has been suggested by case-
control studies12-15 and by population-based studies of clini-
cal16,17 and ultrasound-documented18,19 gallbladder disease in
univariate,16-19 but not in multivariate16-18 analysis.
Hyperinsulinemia is characteristically found in persons
with non­insulin-dependent diabetes as a result of insulin-
resistance, which is considered of primary importance in
diabetes pathogenesis. Fasting insulin can be used as a
surrogate measure of insulin resistance and has been shown
to correlate with whole-body glucose uptake measured by
euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in persons with normal
glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, and non­
insulin-dependent diabetes.20 For a given concentration of
glucose, insulin increases with increasing insulin resistance.
Because approximately 50% of insulin is metabolized on first
passage through the liver, serum insulin level is a poor
measure of hepatic insulin exposure. Equimolar quantities of
insulin and C-peptide are secreted by the pancreas into the
portal vein, but unlike insulin, C-peptide is negligibly ex-
tracted by the liver. Thus, the serum C-peptide level more
accurately reflects insulin secretion and delivery to the liver
on its first passage. We examined the relationship of gallblad-
der disease with fasting serum insulin and C-peptide in a
large, national, population-based study. We also investigated
whether diabetes was associated with gallbladder disease
independently of insulin and C-peptide levels.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) was conducted in the United States from 1988
through 1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It consisted of inter-
view, examination, and laboratory data collected from a complex
multistage, stratified, clustered probability sample of the civilian,
noninstitutionalized population age 2 months and older, with
over-sampling of the elderly, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican-
Americans.21 The study was approved by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention Institutional Review Board and all partici-
pants provided signed consent to participate.

Study Sample and Outcome. The sample for this study consisted of
5,653 participants age 20 to 74 years who were randomly assigned to
be examined in the morning at a mobile examination center after an
overnight fast. Excluded were persons who were interviewed, but
not examined (n  1,318) or were examined at home (n  152),
who were assigned to a morning examination, but attended in the
afternoon or evening (n  344), who fasted less than 9 (n  458) or
24 or more (n  9) hours or whose fasting time was unknown (n 
108), who did not undergo a gallbladder ultrasound (n  93) or
whose gallbladder lumen could not be adequately visualized on
ultrasound (n  14), who had missing data on fasting glucose,
insulin, or C-peptide levels (n  178), pregnant women (n  107),
and persons with diagnosed diabetes (n  325). Persons with
diagnosed diabetes were excluded because they were not asked to
fast. Persons with diabetes identified on NHANES III, but not
previously diagnosed, were included in all analyses.
Gallbladder disease was defined as ultrasound-documented gall-
stones or evidence of cholecystectomy by standard criteria.1 Based
on videotaped recordings of ultrasound examinations, there was
excellent agreement on gallbladder disease diagnosis between the
ultrasonographer and reviewing radiologist (agreement of 99% with
a kappa statistic of 0.97).
Glucose-Related Risk Factor Variables. A fasting venous blood sam-
ple was collected and plasma glucose, serum insulin and C-peptide,
and glycated hemoglobin levels were measured.22 Plasma glucose
was measured using a modified hexokinase enzymatic method
(Roche Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Montclair, NJ), serum insulin and
C-peptide were measured by radioimmunoassay (Pharmacia Diagnos-
tics AB, Uppsala, Sweden, and Bio-Rad Laboratories, Anaheim, CA,
respectively), and glycated hemoglobin was measured using high-
performance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Her-
cules, CA) at the University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO.
As defined by American Diabetic Association criteria, normal fasting
glucose was 110 mg/dL, impaired fasting glucose was between 110
and 126 mg/dL, and undiagnosed diabetes was 126 mg/dL.23
Covariates. Data were collected on known or possible gallbladder
disease risk factors, including age, sex, race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, other), body mass
index (BMI) (weight in kg/height in m2), waist-to-hip circumference
ratio, serum total cholesterol level (mg/dL), cigarette smoking
(never, former, less than one pack per day, one or more packs per
day), alcohol consumption (never, former, less than one drink per
day, one to two drinks per day, more than two drinks per day), and,
for women, number of live births. A physical activity intensity
variable was created by summing the products of activity frequency
in the previous month and an intensity rating for 9 activities
(walking, jogging or running, bicycling, swimming, aerobics, danc-
ing, calisthenics, gardening or yard work, weight lifting).
Statistical Analysis. We examined the relationship between gallblad-
der disease and insulin-related factors by first calculating gallbladder
disease prevalence estimates for each level of the factors. To control
for the effects of other covariates related to gallbladder disease, we
computed adjusted gallbladder disease prevalence estimates using
binary linear regression analysis.24 Prevalence was estimated by least
squares means computed using SUDAAN PROC REGRESS (Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC).25 Adjusted
gallbladder disease prevalence ratios were then calculated by compar-
ing prevalence at each higher level of factors with prevalence at the
lowest level; P values for trend in adjusted prevalence were
computed. Analyses were conducted separately for men and women.
All covariates that had previously been found to be associated with
gallbladder disease (P  .1) in the entire NHANES III sample with a
gallbladder ultrasound (N  13,962) were included in final models.
Glucose was included as a continuous variable in models of insulin
and C-peptide. A 95% confidence interval (CI) that did not include
one (P  .05) was considered to indicate statistical significance. All
analyses incorporated sample weights, stratification, and clustering
using SUDAAN software.25
RESULTS
Gallbladder disease was found in 549 women (18.4%) and
208 men (7.8%). Among women, 2,673 had normal fasting
glucose, 199 had impaired fasting glucose, and 109 had
undiagnosed diabetes. Among men 2,281 had normal fasting
glucose, 280 had impaired fasting glucose, and 111 had
undiagnosed diabetes. Mean insulin levels (SE) in pmol/L
differed in persons with normal fasting glucose, 57 (1),
impaired fasting glucose, 96 (6), and undiagnosed diabetes,
125 (14) (P  .001). The corresponding mean C-peptide
levels in pmol/L were 636 (9), 1,085 (32), and 1,326
(58) (P  .001).
Gallbladder disease prevalence in women is shown in Table
1. In univariate analysis, a higher gallbladder disease preva-
lence was seen with impaired fasting glucose and undiag-
nosed diabetes (P  .001). Higher fasting serum insulin and
C-peptide levels were associated with increased gallbladder
disease prevalence (P  .001). Among women, in multivari-
ate analysis controlling for covariates, persons with undiag-
nosed diabetes had an over 90% higher prevalence of

gallbladder disease than those without diabetes (Table 1).
The strength of the association of gallbladder disease with
fasting insulin and C-peptide was diminished by adjustment
for covariates and for fasting glucose level, but tests for trend
in adjusted prevalence were still strongly positive (P  .01).
Gallbladder disease prevalence increased with fasting insulin-
to- glucose ratio in univariate (P  .001) and in multivariate
analysis (P  .015) (data not shown). Fasting insulin-to-C-
peptide ratio was associated in univariate (P  .001), but not
in multivariate analysis (P  .30) (data not shown). Glycated
hemoglobin level was associated with gallbladder disease in
univariate analysis when women with levels in the highest 5%
were compared with those with lower levels (95%) (P 
.001). No association was found in multivariate analysis (P 
.15) (data not shown).
In men, impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes
were associated with increased risk of gallbladder disease in
univariate analysis (P  .006) (Table 2). Associations with
insulin and C-peptide in univariate analysis were primarily
apparent when the highest quintile was compared with the
lowest. No associations of gallbladder disease with insulin
and C-peptide in men were significant in multivariate analy-
ses after controlling for covariates and fasting glucose (Table
2). In fact, men in the higher insulin and C-peptide quintiles
had a nonsignificantly lower gallbladder disease prevalence
compared with those in the lowest quintile, though this
relationship was not linear. The gallbladder disease preva-
lence ratio for undiagnosed diabetes in men was similar to
that in women, but the ratio estimate was imprecise because
of the smaller number of men with gallbladder disease
resulting in wide confidence intervals. In fact a post-hoc
analysis indicated that the power to detect a prevalence ratio
of 2.11 in men was only about 40% (  0.05). Gallbladder
disease prevalence increased with fasting insulin-to-glucose
ratio in univariate (P  .016), but not in multivariate analysis
(P  .49) (data not shown). Fasting insulin-to-C-peptide
ratio was unassociated in univariate (P  .10) or multivariate
analysis (P  .65) (data not shown). Glycated hemoglobin
level was associated with gallbladder disease in univariate
analysis when men with levels in the highest 5% were
compared with those with lower levels (95%) (P  .023). No
association was found in multivariate analysis (P  .64) (data
not shown).
The relationship of gallbladder disease with diabetes melli-
tus was examined in more detail. First, because obesity is
associated with both gallbladder disease and diabetes, the
relationship of gallbladder disease with diabetes status was
examined stratified by BMI quintile. Within each BMI quin-
tile, persons with diabetes had a higher age-adjusted gallblad-
der disease prevalence than persons with normal fasting
glucose or impaired fasting glucose, except in the lowest BMI
quintile in which there were too few persons with diabetes to
evaluate (data not shown). Next, to examine whether insulin
level was responsible for the association of gallbladder disease
with undiagnosed diabetes, fasting serum insulin level was
added to the model for undiagnosed diabetes, while adjusting
only for age. The increased risk of gallbladder disease in
women with undiagnosed diabetes (prevalence ratio [PR] 
2.32) was modestly dampened by including the fasting
insulin level in the model (PR  1.90) (Table 3). In the
age-adjusted model in men, the serum insulin level had less
of an effect on the association between gallbladder disease
and undiagnosed diabetes than in women (Table 3). Finally,
the effect of insulin level on the relationship between
gallbladder disease and undiagnosed diabetes was examined
in multivariate analysis. The increased risk of gallbladder
disease in women with undiagnosed diabetes (PR  1.91)
was not affected by including fasting insulin level in the
model (PR  1.85) (Table 3). Substituting fasting serum
C-peptide for insulin in the model also had no effect. The
association of gallbladder disease with undiagnosed diabetes
in multivariate analysis in men was likewise unaffected by
including insulin and C-peptide in the model (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This study provides evidence from a large, national,
population-based sample for an association of gallbladder
disease with higher fasting serum insulin and C-peptide
levels in women. The association was independent of fasting
glucose and other covariates related to gallbladder disease.
Prior studies that found an association of gallbladder disease
and insulin levels had smaller sample sizes and did not
control for the large number of covariates that could poten-
tially confound the relationship, such as race-ethnicity,26
obesity,27 regional fat distribution,28 exogenous estrogen,29
smoking,30 and physical activity.31 The association of gallblad-

der disease with fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels
that we found in women was independent of all these factors
as well as of glucose level.
Insulin may play a role in gallstone formation by increasing
cholesterol saturation of bile or by decreasing gallbladder
motility, two important factors in gallstone pathogenesis.
Persons with non­insulin-dependent diabetes, who typically
have elevated blood insulin levels because of insulin resis-
tance, have been shown to have a higher bile cholesterol
saturation index compared with controls,32,33 although not in
all studies.34 Insulin treatment of persons with non­insulin-
dependent diabetes significantly raised the cholesterol satura-
tion index.35 A higher insulin concentration could predispose
to gallstone formation by increasing the activity of hydroxy-
methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase,36 the rate limiting
enzyme in hepatic synthesis of new cholesterol, or by
activating low density lipoprotein receptors37 resulting in
greater hepatic uptake of low density lipoprotein cholesterol.
By inhibiting basal and cholecystokinin-stimulated gallblad-
der motility, insulin might also increase gallstone risk through
an effect on motility.38
The lack of an association of gallbladder disease with
fasting serum insulin level in men may be caused by
decreased statistical power to detect such a relationship in
men, who have a lower prevalence of gallstones. In addition,
although the majority of gallstones in the United States are
cholesterol stones rather than pigment stones,39 the propor-
tion of cholesterol stones is lower in men than in women.40,41
The lower prevalence and greater heterogeneity of gallstones
in men may be responsible for differences between sexes in
this study, as well as the fact that fewer risk factors have been
found for gallbladder disease in men than in women.1
Alternatively, insulin may act differently in relation to gall-
stone formation in men and women. The nonsignificantly
lower adjusted gallbladder disease prevalence in men with
higher fasting insulin and C-peptide levels might suggest this
possibility. Nevertheless, there is no physiological reason to
suspect such a gender difference.
The association of gallbladder disease with insulin did not
account for the increased risk of gallstones in persons with
undiagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose 126 mg/dL). Al-
though the association of gallbladder disease and diabetes in
men was not statistically significant, the prevalence ratio was
just as high as in women and was previously found to be
statistically significant in the entire NHANES III sample (n 
13,962).1 Thus diabetes appears to be a risk factor for
gallbladder disease regardless of the presence of other factors
associated with gallbladder disease including age, BMI, and
ethnicity, as well as insulin and C-peptide levels. The failure
of insulin to account for the association of diabetes and
gallbladder disease may have partly been caused by limita-
tions of the study. Being a cross-sectional study, insulin and
C-peptide levels at the time of examination may not have
been the same as at the time of gallstone formation. Also,
serum insulin concentration is only a surrogate for insulin
resistance. Nevertheless, the current study of gallbladder
disease suggests that both hyperinsulinemia and diabetes are
independent risk factors in women and that diabetes may be a
risk factor in men.

APPENDIX
To calculate 95% confidence intervals for adjusted gallblad-
der disease prevalence ratios the following method was used.
The log of the adjusted prevalence ratio, log(xi
/x0
), was
calculated where xi
represents gallbladder disease prevalence
at each higher level of a factor and x0
at the lowest level of the
factor. The variance of the log of the adjusted prevalence ratio
was computed using the following formula: var[log(xi
/x0
)] 
5(1/xi
)2 var(xi
)6  5[2/(xi
)(x0
)] cov(xi
,x0
)6  5(1/x0
)2 var(x0
)6.
The variance and covariance of the adjusted prevalence
(least squares means) used in this equation were calculated
from the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated regres-
sion coefficients and the vector of least squares means
contrast coefficients (mean values for the covariates included
in the multivariate model) generated by the binary linear
regression analysis as follows: V(L)  CV()C, where
V(L)  variance-covariance matrix of adjusted prevalence,
C  transposed vector of least squares means contrast
coefficients, V()  variance-covariance matrix of estimated
regression coefficients, and C  vector of least squares means
contrast coefficients. SAS IML software (SAS, 1990) was used
to perform matrix algebra.
Because the standard error of the log of the adjusted
prevalence ratio, SE[log(xi
/x0
), is the square root of the
variance of the log of the adjusted prevalence ratio, var[log(xi
/
x0
), calculated above, the 95% confidence interval for the log
of the adjusted prevalence ratio was computed as follows:
log(xi
/x0
) / 1.96 SE[log(xi
/x0
)]. The 95% confidence inter-
