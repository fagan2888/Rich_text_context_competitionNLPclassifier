The decline in vitamin D status among older people is probably due to decreased synthesis of vitamin D by sun-
exposed skin and/or decreased outdoor activity. The authors examined the association between outdoor leisure
physical activity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(1988­1994) (n ¼ 15,148 aged !20 years). The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration declined with increasing
age, with 79, 73, and 68 nmol/liter for persons aged 20­39, 40­59, and 60 or more years. The proportion that
engaged in outdoor activity in the past month was 80% for persons aged 20­39 and 40­59 years but 71% for those
aged 60 or more years. In contrast, the mean difference in 25-hydroxyvitamin D between those who participated in
outdoor activities daily compared with those who did not participate in the past month was similar for the youngest
and oldest age groups: 13 and 16 nmol/liter, respectively. Those persons aged 60 or more years who participated
in daily outdoor activities had a mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration similar to that of persons aged 20­39
years: 77 versus 79 nmol/liter, respectively. These nationally representative data suggest that persons aged 60 or
more years can synthesize enough vitamin D from daily outdoor activities to maintain vitamin D levels similar to
those of young adults.

Increasing evidence suggests that low vitamin D status is
a risk factor for a range of diseases, including bone disease,
infection, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (1).
A recent meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials including
more than 57,000 participants demonstrated a significant
reduction in all-cause mortality among older individuals
assigned to vitamin D supplements (2). Sun exposure is
the primary determinant of vitamin D status, but age and
the degree of skin pigmentation are known to modify the
effect of the sun on vitamin D synthesis (3).
Since the late 1970s, researchers have noted that body
levels of vitamin D, as measured by serum 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D, decline with age (4, 5). This decline is due partly
to a decreased capacity by the epidermis of the elderly to
photosynthesize previtamin D, as compared with younger
subjects (6), but the decline also may be due to decreased
sun exposure because sun tanning and sun burning decrease
with age (7, 8).

Racial/ethnic variations in vitamin D status also occur,
with lower levels observed in non-Hispanic Blacks and
Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic Whites
(9). Vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
<50 nmol/liter) is much more common among non-
Hispanic Blacks (in winter ranging from 53 percent to 76 per-
cent across the main age-sex subgroups) than in Mexican
Americans (18­50 percent) and non-Hispanic Whites (8­33
percent) (9). Studies of vitamin D photosynthesis have
shown that non-Whites have a similar capacity to synthesize
vitamin D, but they require longer exposure to sunlight to
achieve a similar vitamin D response because of their in-
creased skin pigmentation (10, 11).
Outdoor activities increase body vitamin D levels through
sun-induced synthesis of vitamin D. Previous studies have
shown a positive association between physical activity, in
general, and vitamin D status. Blood levels of 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D have been observed to be higher in weightlifters
and track athletes than matched sedentary controls in some
studies (12, 13) but not all (14, 15). The cited studies had
small sample sizes (n < 60) that may have decreased power
to detect an association between physical activity and
25-hydroxyvitamin D.
Few epidemiologic studies have examined the relation
between leisure-time physical activity and vitamin D status
in the general population. In the early 1990s, a cross-sectional
survey of middle-aged men in New Zealand found that
men who engaged in weekly leisure-time aerobic activities
(indoor and outdoor combined) had significantly increased
plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared with in-
active men after adjustment for weekly hours of sunshine
exposure, especially in winter (16). In a healthy workforce
sample, also in New Zealand, the mean level of serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D3
, the vitamin D metabolite formed
mainly from sun exposure and which comprises the major
portion of body vitamin D (1), was higher in people en-
gaging in vigorous (aerobic) leisure physical activities
compared with those who were inactive, after adjustment
for age, sex, ethnicity, and time of year (17); moreover,
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
was 11­13 nmol/liter higher in
those who participated in outdoor versus indoor activities.
Recent reports have confirmed these earlier findings. Analy-
ses of male US health professionals showed that participants
in the highest quintile of leisure-time physical activity had a
13.5 nmol/liter higher level of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D
than those in the lowest activity quintile (18). A cross-
sectional survey in Florida found that osteoporosis patients
who reported participating in outdoor exercisewere 47 percent
less likely to have hypovitaminosis D (25-hydroxyvitamin D,
30 ng/ml or 75 nmol/liter) than were nonoutdoor exercisers
(19). Finally, Dutch studies of older people living in the com-
munity have observed a positive association between the level
of physical activity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (20) and
reported that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased by
1.8 nmol/liter for each hour per day of outdoor activity (21).
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) involved a representative sample of
the US civilian population, who were interviewed during
1988­1994. With serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D measure-
ments from over 19,000 participants, NHANES III offers
a unique opportunity to examine the association between
leisure-time physical activity and vitamin D status, as well
as whether the observed association varies with place of
activity (outdoor or indoor), type of activity (vigorous or
moderate), age, race/ethnicity, and time of year.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A cross-sectional survey representative of the US civilian
noninstitutionalized population (NHANES III) was carried
out during 1988­1994 by the National Center for Health
Statistics. A stratified, multistage sampling design was used
to recruit participants from household clusters, with over-
sampling of non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans.
After an initial interview at home, participants visited mo-
bile centers where they had an extensive physical examina-
tion. Full details of all survey methods, including sampling,
interview, examination and laboratory measurement of
blood samples, ethical approval, and informed consent, have
been published (22).
A total of 23,258 adults, aged 20 or more years, were
invited to take part in the survey. Of these, 18,825 were
interviewed at home, 16,573 of whom attended mobile ex-
amination centers. In the home interview, information was
collected on a wide range of variables including age, sex,
and race/ethnicity (self-assigned as non-Hispanic White,
non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, other). Partici-
pants were asked about frequency and type of food intake
over the past month. For milk consumption, participants
were asked how often they had milk to drink or on cereal.
The four questions on frequency of consumption of break-
fast cereal, generally fortified with 40­50 IU of vitamin
D per 28-g serving (23), covered the major brands for cold
cereals plus cooked, hot cereals. Information on the intake
of vitamin D supplements in the past month came from
a general question asking, ``Have you taken any vitamins
or minerals in the past month?'' Samples of each supple-
ment were checked for their content when participants
attended the mobile examination centers. Further details
about the questions on food and vitamin D intake have been
published (23).
The frequency of leisure-time activities in the past month
was assessed from questions on nine common activities and
up to four other activities (24). The common activities were
walking a mile or more (!1.6 km) without stopping,
jogging/running, bicycling (including exercise bicycle), swim-
ming, aerobics, other dancing, calisthenics, gardening, and
weights. These activities, and those listed in appendix 2 of
the documentation for the NHANES III adult data set
(25), were categorized as outdoor (e.g., walking, jogging,
gardening) or indoor (e.g., aerobics, weights) by the first
author (R. S.). Activities that could have been indoor or
outdoor (e.g., bicycling including exercise bike, swim-
ming, basketball) were classified as indoor. From the met-
abolic equivalents assigned for each physical activity,
participants aged 60 or more years were classified as en-
gaging in moderate or vigorous activities if the metabolic
equivalent for any activity was 3.0 or more or 6.0 or
more, respectively, while those aged 20­59 years were

similarly classified if the metabolic equivalent for any
activity was 3.5 or more or 7.0 or more, respectively (26).
At the mobile examination centers, participants were
dressed in underpants, disposable light clothing, and slip-
pers while being weighed in kilograms, to two decimal
places, on electronic scales. Height was measured to the near-
est millimeter with a fixed stadiometer (27). Body mass index
was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. The date of the
interview was used to classify people by calendar month.
Blood samples collected during the examination were centri-
fuged, aliquoted, and frozen to À70°C on site, before being
shippedondryicetocentrallaboratorieswheretheywerestored
at À70°C until analysis (28). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
was measured by a radioimmunoassay kit after extraction with
acetonitrile (DiaSorin, Inc., Stillwater, Minnesota) by the
National Center for Environmental Health in Atlanta, Georgia
(29). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations ranged from
8.7 to 243.6 nmol/liter after one person with a 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D value of 400.1 nmol/liter was excluded.
Data in this report are restricted to non-Hispanic White,
non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican-American adults, aged
20 or more years, who attended the mobile examination
centers (n ¼ 15,148) after excluding those who had missing
25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements (n ¼ 790), the one
person with a very high outlying 25-hydroxyvitamin D
value of 400.1 nmol/liter, and those who were of ``other''
race/ethnicity (n ¼ 634).
Statistical analyses were carried out with SUDAAN, ver-
sion 9.0.0, software (SUDAAN Statistical Software Center,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), by using the sam-
pling weights from the mobile examination centers to adjust
for oversampling of non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican
Americans and to correct standard errors for any design
effect arising from clustered sampling. Statistical signifi-
cance was two sided.

Physical Activity and Vitamin D 579

in outdoor leisure activity in the past month was similar for
those aged 20­39 and 40­59 years (each with 80 percent)
but lower for those aged 60 or more years (71 percent).
There was even greater variation with age in the proportion
engaging in indoor activity, from 68 percent in the youngest
age group down to 37 percent in the oldest group. Males
were more likely than females to participate in outdoor
and indoor activities. With regard to race/ethnicity, non-
Hispanic Whites were most likely to engage in both outdoor
and indoor activities and Mexican Americans least likely.
The proportion engaging in outdoor and indoor activity
also varied by month, being lowest in January-February
and increasing to a peak in July-August before declining
again.
The adjusted mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concen-
trations varied between levels of demographic and lifestyle
variables (table 2). The vitamin D level decreased with in-
creasing age, particularly between the ages of 20­39 and
40­49 years, and was lower in women than men. For race/
ethnicity, vitamin D was highest in non-Hispanic Whites,
intermediate in Mexican Americans, and lowest in non-
Hispanic Blacks. Vitamin D levels were inversely associated
with body mass index. The expected seasonal variation in
25-hydroxyvitamin D was present, with levels being lowest
in March-April and highest in July-October, adjusting for
covariates.
Vitamin D concentrations were also related to lifestyle,
being positively associated with frequency of milk intake in
the last month and with daily amount of vitamin D supple-
ment intake, but not with cereal intake. With regard to
leisure physical activity, the adjusted mean serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lowest in partici-
pants who had no leisure-time physical activity during the
previous month, compared with those who were physically
active, and increased in a stepwise fashion with increasing
frequency of activity.

vitamin D and the place (outdoor/indoor) and intensity
(aerobic/nonaerobic) of leisure physical activity. Compared
with that of inactive participants, the mean difference

in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level increased with the fre-
quency of both outdoor and indoor activities, with adjust-
ment for demographic and lifestyle variables, but the
difference in vitamin D was twice as high for outdoor ac-
tivities as for indoor activities. The intensity of physical
activity was associated with a difference in vitamin D sim-
ilar to that with outdoor activity, with vitamin D being 10.7
nmol/liter higher in people engaging in daily vigorous ac-
tivities and 11.5 nmol/liter higher in people engaging in
daily outdoor activities compared with inactive people.
However, when all three categories of physical activity were
entered in the same model, only outdoor activity remained
significantly associated with a higher serum 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D level compared with inactive people (p ¼ 0.0005).
We examined the differences in vitamin D by frequency
of outdoor activities to see if the differences varied by de-
mographic variable and time of year. Figure 1 shows that the
mean difference in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level between
those who engaged in outdoor activities compared with
those who engaged in none in the past month was similar
for those aged 20­39 and 60 or more years (13 vs. 16 nmol/
liter, respectively). The mean vitamin D differences for fre-
quency of outdoor activity were similar for men and women
and did not vary greatly by time of year (data not shown).
In contrast, the mean vitamin D difference by frequency
of outdoor activity varied with race/ethnicity, being higher
at all activity frequency levels in non-Hispanic Whites com-
pared with both Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic
Blacks (figure 2).
The adjusted mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concen-
trations for outdoor activity frequency groups are shown in
table 4 according to demographic variables and time of year.
With regard to age, participants aged 60 or more years had
lower vitamin D levels in all activity frequency groups.
However, the mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration
for participants aged 60 or more years who engaged in daily
outdoor activities (77 nmol/liter) was similar to the mean for
participants aged 20­39 years who were inactive or engaged

gaged in daily outdoor activities had a mean 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D level (79 nmol/liter) that was higher than or
similar to those of men who were inactive (74 nmol/liter)

in the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level were so large that
vitamin D levels for non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican
Americans engaging in daily outdoor activities (52 and 66
nmol/liter, respectively) were lower than that for inactive
non-Hispanic Whites (73 nmol/liter).
DISCUSSION
These findings from a nationally representative US sam-
ple indicate that regular outdoor physical activity is associ-
ated with higher levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. In
particular, consistent with previous research (17), it is the
place of physical activity (outdoor rather than indoor) and
the frequency of activity rather than the intensity that are
related to vitamin D status (table 3).
Previous research has shown that the capacity to synthe-
size vitamin D from solar ultraviolet B exposure decreases
with age (6). A somewhat surprising observation in the
present study was that the 25-hydroxyvitamin D increase
with daily outdoor activity in people aged 60 or more years
was as great as that in people aged 20­39 years (figure 1).
One explanation is that older people, who are mostly retired,
may spend more time outside each time they participate in
physical activity than younger and middle-aged people who
are mostly working. Another explanation is that adults aged
less than 60 years, who are mostly working, are less able to
do physical activity in the middle of the day when ultraviolet
radiation from the sun is strongest (30). The elevated serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D level in people aged 60 or more years
who participated in daily outdoor physical activity indicates
that this activity pattern can minimize and potentially pre-
vent the age-related decline in body vitamin D status. This
finding is consistent with that of a recent survey of people
aged 60­87 years who were living in a Dutch town (i.e., that
outdoor activities were associated with significantly higher
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels) (21).
The increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with daily
outdoor physical activity occurred in all seasons (table 4).
This result was also surprising because solar radiation is
strongest in summer and weakest in winter when prolonged
sun exposure (>4 hours) is required for skin to synthesize
vitamin D at latitudes above 25 degrees, particularly
above 42 degrees North where no synthesis takes place
(30, 31). However, interviews in NHANES III were carried
out mainly in the southern states during winter and in the
northern states during summer to ensure optimal weather
conditions for interviewing (9). Thus, the NHANES III
sample will have overestimated solar radiation exposure
in winter and underestimated it in summer, since the inten-
sity of solar radiation is inversely associated with latitude
(30).

Physical Activity and Vitamin D 583

Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Blacks, was ex-
pected because the capacity to synthesize vitamin D from
sun exposure is inversely related to the degree of skin pig-
mentation (10, 11). The maximum mean level of serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D of 52 nmol/liter in non-Hispanic
Blacks observed among those who engaged in daily outdoor
activity (table 4) is of concern, given recent evidence sug-
gesting that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels need to be
above 75 nmol/liter for optimum health (32). Other strate-
gies, such as vitamin D supplementation or fortification of
food, as already occurs with milk, are required to elevate
25-hydroxyvitamin D in African Americans to the above
desired level during winter months at higher latitudes. The
lack of an association between cereal consumption and se-
rum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (table 2) contrasts with results for
African American and White women aged 15­49 years from
the same study that showed significantly higher unadjusted
vitamin D levels for women in the highest cereal consump-
tion category, although the significant association between
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and cereals remained only in
Black women after adjusting for covariates that included
milk consumption (23). In our analyses, there was a signif-
icant positive association (p < 0.001) between the frequency
of cereal intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D when milk
was excluded from the model (data not shown), indicating
that milk consumption was a positive confounder. Thus,
cereal consumption in the United States during 1988­1994
may have been associated with vitamin D status in sub-
groups such as young Black women (23), but not in the total
population.
Daily outdoor physical activity was associated with an
increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D similar to that of daily
consumption of milk, both about 10 nmol/liter (table 2),
indicating that both are likely to be effective strategies for
modest increases in body levels of vitamin D. Daily con-
sumption of at least 400 IU of vitamin D supplements was
associated with a smaller increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D
of about 5 nmol/liter (table 2), a little lower than the reported
increase of 1.75 nmol/liter per 100 IU of vitamin D3
or
7 nmol/liter per 400 IU supplement (33). A possible expla-
nation is that many participants may have used vitamin D2
that does not increase 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as much as
vitamin D3
(34). More importantly, recent studies indicate
that much higher levels (e.g., 4,000 IU per day) are required
to increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels up to 100
nmol/liter (35). These and other data (33, 36) suggest that
the larger-dosed vitamin D supplements would assist
individuals living at higher latitudes to have optimal levels
of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
The finding of a strong association between outdoor phys-
ical activity and vitamin D status has implications for public
health. The data in table 1 show that 22 percent of all US
adults did not participate in any outdoor physical activity in
the past month at the time NHANES III was carried out. Of
concern, those groups with the lowest vitamin D levels--the
elderly, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic Blacks--
were least likely to have reported engaging in any outdoor
physical activity in the past month. Public health interven-
tions supporting outdoor activities probably would improve
the vitamin D status of these communities. Previous
research suggests that a 10 nmol/liter increase in 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D from daily outdoor physical activity (table 3)
could result in modest but important reductions in disease
rates. For example, a recent meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials has shown that a weighted vitamin D dose
of 528 IU/day, estimated to have increased 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D by 1.75 nmol/liter per 100 IU (33) or about 9
nmol/liter, reduced total mortality by 7 percent (2). A
cohort study of US health professionals observed that
a 25 nmol/liter increase in predicted plasma 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D was associated with a 17 percent reduction in
total cancer incidence (37), equivalent to a 7 percent reduc-
tion for a 10 nmol/liter increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
The association between outdoor physical activity and
vitamin D status provides another mechanism for how
physical activity may lower chronic disease risk. The well-
documented inverse association between physical activity
and various diseases, such as coronary heart disease, diabe-
tes, and breast and colon cancers (38), may partly be due to
increased vitamin D levels arising from outdoor physical
activity, since epidemiologic evidence suggests that low vi-
tamin D status increases the risk of these diseases after con-
trolling for physical activity (39­41).
This study has a few limitations. Its cross-sectional design
precludes determination of cause and effect. Moreover,
measurement error is likely to be present, particularly with
regard to physical activity measures. For example, the place
of physical activity (outdoor or indoor) was not recorded
during the interview and had to be inferred from the type
of activity. Information was collected only on the frequency
of physical activity and not on the time participating in
activity or the time of day when it was carried out. Both
of the latter are likely to have influenced serum 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D levels. Further, the determination of vitamin D
status from a single measure of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
also is likely to have contributed to measurement error. If
this measurement error was random, it may have weakened
the observed association between outdoor physical activity
and vitamin D, in which case, the true effect of outdoor
physical activity on vitamin D status maybe stronger than
what is reported in this paper.
In summary, nationally representative data demonstrate
a strong association between the frequency of outdoor phys-
ical activity and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the
US population. Daily outdoor activities may be able to re-
dress the differences in vitamin D status associated with age
and sex, but not those associated with race/ethnicity. Public
health strategies that support daily outdoor activities that are
safe (e.g., by avoiding sun burn) probably will increase the
vitamin D status of the general population. However, addi-
tional strategies, such as higher-dosed vitamin D supple-
ments, are required for African Americans in order to
achieve optimal vitamin D levels.
