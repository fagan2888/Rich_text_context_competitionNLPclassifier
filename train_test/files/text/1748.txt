Conduct disorder (CD) is characterized by
persistent behavioral patterns that violate social
rules and the rights of individuals (American
Psychiatric Association 2000). Children with
CD display aggression toward people and ani-
mals, intentionally destroy others' property,
and chronically steal or deceive. Children with
CD are at increased risk for drug and alcohol
abuse, antisocial personality disorder, and
anxiety-related disorders (Goldstein et al.
2006; Gunter et al. 2006). Public expenditures
related to general and mental health care,
school services, and juvenile justice for children
with CD exceed $10,000 per child per year
(Foster and Jones 2005).
The national prevalence of CD is
unknown. It is estimated from community-
based regional samples that 0.4­3.3% of chil-
dren and adolescents have CD, with males
two to three times more likely than females to
receive a CD diagnosis (Lahey et al. 2000;
Loeber et al. 2000; Maughan et al. 2004).
Prior variation in CD prevalence estimates
may be related to the informant, the diagnos-
tic instrument, the version of Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
used (3rd ed., 3rd ed. rev., or 4th ed.), partici-
pants' age, socioeconomic status, and degree
of urbanicity (Loeber et al. 2000). To date,
no studies have provided an estimate of the
national prevalence of CD in U.S. children
using criteria of the 4th edition of the
DSM (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric
Association 2000).
Questions also persist about the under-
lying risk factors for the development of CD
(Burke et al. 2002). Prenatal tobacco smoke
exposure has been consistently associated
with disruptive behavior disorders, such as
oppositional defiant disorder and CD, even
after controlling for potential confounders,
including sociodemographic factors, prenatal
insults, and parental psychopathology
(Fergusson et al. 1993, 1998; Wakschlag
et al. 1997, 2002; Weissman et al. 1999).
Results from a prospective cohort in New
Zealand indicate that children exposed to
tobacco smoke in utero had CD symptom
rates approximately two times higher than
unexposed children (Fergusson et al. 1998).
Another prospective study of approximately
6,000 Finnish males found that prenatal
tobacco smoke exposure was associated with a
1.74-fold increased odds of committing a
delinquent act in late childhood or early
adulthood (Rantakallio et al. 1992).
Although prior studies have documented
associations between prenatal tobacco smoke
exposure and CD, the relationship between
postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
exposure and CD is less clear (Fergusson et al.
1998; Weitzman et al. 1992). Weitzman et al.
(1992) reported significant increases in the
number of behavior problems among children
whose mothers smoked only after pregnancy.
Compared with children of nonsmoking
women, children exposed to postnatal ETS
had a 2-fold increased odds of having extreme
behavior problems on the Behavior Problem
Index of the Child Behavior Checklist
(CBCL) (Weitzman et al. 1992). Similarly, in
a New Zealand cohort, Fergusson et al.
(1998) found an increased number of CD
symptoms among children exposed to post-
natal ETS. To date, none of these studies has
used a biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure
to measure the association between ETS and
behavior problems. This limitation can result
in exposure misclassification, because a sub-
stantial proportion of women who report no
ETS exposure have measurable cotinine levels
(DeLorenze et al. 2002).
The relationship between environmental
lead exposure and violent, aggressive, and
oppositional behavior was first reported by
Byers and Lord (1943). They observed that
among 20 lead-poisoned children, 19 who
had "recovered" from lead poisoning failed
high school or had behavioral problems.
Since then, elevated bone and blood lead lev-
els have been associated with an increased risk
of juvenile delinquency in late childhood and
early adulthood in case­control and prospec-
tive cohort studies (Dietrich et al. 2001;
Needleman et al. 1996, 2002). Earlier studies
observed children with higher blood lead

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of tobacco smoke and
environmental lead exposure with conduct disorder (CD).
METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001­2004 is a
nationally representative cross-sectional sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population. We
examined the association of prenatal tobacco, postnatal tobacco, and environmental lead exposure
with CD in children 8­15 years of age (n = 3,081). We measured prenatal tobacco exposure by par-
ent report of cigarette use during pregnancy, and postnatal tobacco using serum cotinine levels. We
assessed lead exposure using current blood lead concentration. Parents completed the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule for Children to determine whether their children met criteria of the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) for CD.
RESULTS: Overall, 2.06% of children met DSM-IV criteria for CD in the past year, equivalent to
560,000 U.S. children 8­15 years of age. After adjustment, prenatal tobacco exposure was associ-
ated with increased odds for CD [odds ratio (OR) = 3.00; 95% confidence interval (CI),
1.36­6.63]. Increased blood lead levels (fourth vs. first quartile) and serum cotinine levels (fifth vs.
first quintile) were associated with an 8.64-fold (95% CI, 1.87­40.04) and 9.15-fold (95% CI,
1.47­6.90) increased odds of meeting DSM-IV CD criteria. Increasing serum cotinine levels and
blood lead levels were also associated with increased prevalence of CD symptoms (symptom count
ratio, lead: 1.73; 95% CI, 1.23­2.43; symptom count ratio, cotinine: 1.97; 95% CI, 1.15­3.40).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that prenatal tobacco exposure and environmental lead expo-
sure contribute substantially to CD in U.S. children.

levels than the levels currently seen; thus,
inferences may not be directly relevant to
contemporary children with lower blood lead
levels (Dietrich et al. 2001; Needleman et al.
1996, 2002). Additionally, recent studies
have observed associations between blood lead
levels below the current Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention recommended action
level of 10 µg/dL and cognitive and behav-
ioral deficits (Braun et al. 2006; Lanphear
et al. 2005). It is unclear whether lower blood
lead levels are associated with more severe
behavioral problems such as CD in children.
The purpose of this study was to provide
an estimate of the national prevalence of CD
defined using DSM-IV criteria and to test the
hypothesis that exposures to ETS and child-
hood lead exposure were associated with CD
in a large nationally representative sample of
U.S. children.
Materials and Methods
Data source. The data for this analysis came
from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted
from 2001 through 2004. NHANES is a
cross-sectional household survey of the non-
institutionalized civilian population. NHANES
used a complex, multistage probability sam-
pling design, with oversampling of adolescents
12­19 years of age, adults  60 years of age,
low-income persons, Mexican Americans, and
non-Hispanic blacks. This method of over-
sampling allows for more valid and precise
estimates to be derived among subgroups
than a simple random sampling methodology
would. Details regarding interviews, examina-
tion procedures, and sample collection have
been described elsewhere (National Center
for Health Statistics 2007b).
Assessment of CD. The National Institute
of Mental Health's Diagnostic Interview
Schedule for Children­Caregiver Module
(DISC) was used to assess for the presence of
mental health disorders based on DSM-IV
criteria. The DISC is a structured diagnostic
interview instrument designed for use by lay
interviewers in clinical and epidemiologic
studies. Reliable versions are available in
English and Spanish (Bravo et al. 2001;
Shaffer et al. 2000). Caregivers of children
8­15 years of age completed the CD DISC
module in English or Spanish by phone
2­4 weeks after the child's NHANES Mobile
Examination Center (MEC) visit, providing
information about the child's CD symptoms
over the preceding 4 weeks, 12 months, and
lifetime. DISC algorithms were used to deter-
mine whether the child met the criteria for
CD diagnosis within the last 4 weeks,
12 months, and lifetime. For this analysis, our
primary outcomes were meeting DSM-IV CD
criteria (dichotomous) and CD symptom
count in the preceding 12 months. Children
met DSM-IV CD criteria if they had three or
more symptoms in the preceding 12 months,
with at least one symptom in the preceding
6 months. Symptom counts during the pre-
ceding 12 months for children 8­15 years of
age ranged from 0 to 12 symptoms.
Environmental exposures. We used parent
report to measure children's exposure to
tobacco products. Measurement of prenatal
tobacco smoke exposure consisted of the ques-
tion, "Did the child's biological mother smoke
at any time while she was pregnant with
him/her?" No information on the quantity or
brand of cigarettes smoked during pregnancy
was collected.
Information on postnatal ETS exposure
included parent report about the presence of a
smoker in the home, the number of packs of
cigarettes smoked in the home, and the
child's serum cotinine levels. Exposure to
household ETS was assessed by asking, "Does
anyone who lives here smoke cigarettes, cig-
ars, or pipes anywhere inside this home?" In
addition, interviewers asked for the number
of cigarettes smoked per day inside the home.
Cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, was meas-
ured using high-performance liquid chro-
matography­tandem mass spectrometry
(Bernert et al. 2000). The limit of detection
(LOD) for this assay was 0.015 ng/mL;
573 (20.0%) children had levels below this
level. Cotinine levels > 10 ng/mL (n = 82) are
indicative of active smoking; thus, children
with values above this level were excluded
from all analyses (Benowitz et al. 1983).
Blood lead concentration was determined
by graphite furnace atomic absorption spec-
trophotometry (Miller et al. 1987; Parsons
and Slavin 1993). The LOD was 0.3 µg/dL;
38 children had blood lead levels below this
threshold. We ran secondary analyses exclud-
ing children with blood lead levels  10 µg/dL
(n = 6) to determine whether they had exces-
sive influence on our models.
Covariates. We examined covariates
thought a priori to possibly confound the rela-
tionship between CD and prenatal tobacco
smoke, postnatal ETS, and lead exposure.
Demographic variables included the child's
age, sex, race, socioeconomic status as meas-
ured by poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), and
mother's age at child's birth (< 18 years vs.
 18 years). PIR is the ratio of household
income to the poverty threshold for a family of
a given size in the respective year of the inter-
view. PIR provides for a better measure of
socioeconomic status by controlling for both
income and household size. PIR values were
coded into four categories to reflect the current
standards used in government-financed welfare
programs (< 1.00, 1.00­1.85, 1.85­3.0, and
> 3.0). Because low birth weight and neonatal
intensive care unit (NICU) admission may act
as intervening variables on the causal pathway
between prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and
CD, we did not include these two variables in
our multivariate analyses.
Statistical analysis. We used logistic
regression to analyze the associations among
environmental, demographic, and medical
factors with meeting DSM-IV CD criteria in
the past year (yes/no). We used Poisson
regression to analyze the association between
children's symptom count in the preceding
year and demographic, medical, and environ-
mental factors. We used Poisson regression
models to compare the ratio of symptom
counts across demographic, medical, and
environmental variables along with respective
mean symptom counts within strata of these
variables. We did not use an offset term in
our Poisson models.
Because cotinine provides a more objec-
tive measure of ETS exposure than parent
report, we used it in our primary analyses.
Serum cotinine and blood lead levels were
categorized into quintiles and quartiles,
respectively, using weighted percentages.
We conducted a secondary analysis to
determine the effect of postnatal ETS expo-
sure among children without prenatal tobacco
smoke exposure. To provide more precise
estimates of the effect, we conducted this
analysis using only CD symptom counts
(Poisson models).
We used logistic regression models to
calculate the odds of meeting DSM-IV CD cri-
teria within each quintile of cotinine exposure
or quartile of lead exposure, using the first
quintile or quartile as the common referent
group. We fit Poisson regression models with
the same quintile and quartile categorical vari-
ables that we used in logistic regression models.
Regression diagnostics identified influen-
tial observations, overdispersion, or collinear-
ity, and we observed no collinearity or
overdispersion. Potential influential observa-
tions were identified in the logistic regression
models (n = 4) and Poisson regression models
(n = 20) using standardized residuals. The
exclusion of these outliers did not appreciably
alter the estimates of prenatal tobacco smoke
exposure, postnatal ETS exposure, or blood
lead levels. We report here all multivariable
results with influential observations.
We performed analyses using the
SUDAAN statistical package to account for
the multistage, complex sampling design
(Research Triangle Institute 2004). Sample
weights were applied according to the
National Center for Health Statistics guide-
lines to produce accurate national estimates,
adjusting for the oversampling of minorities
and young children (National Center for
Health Statistics 2007a).

Results
A total of 3,907 children 8­15 years of age
were interviewed, and 3,799 (97.2%) of these
children completed the MEC examination in
2001­2004. A total of 3,081 (78.9%) parents
completed the DISC telephone interview,
and 2,619 (67.0%) children had complete
data available for multivariable analysis.
Table 1 lists the characteristics of children
whose parents did and did not complete the
DISC telephone interview. Children whose
parents completed the DISC were more likely
to be older (13­15 years of age), white, and in
the highest PIR category, to have lower blood
lead levels, to not live with a smoker, and to
have a birth weight > 2,500 g, compared with
the 826 (21.1%) children whose parents did
not complete the DISC.
Of the 3,081 children 8­15 years of age
available for analysis, 68 [2.06%; 95% confi-
dence interval (CI), 1.47­2.88%] met the
DSM-IV criteria for CD in the past year,
equivalent to 560,000 U.S. children and ado-
lescents. Children exposed to prenatal tobacco
smoke, postnatal ETS, and environmental
lead had a higher prevalence of CD. CD
prevalence was higher among male children
(2.24%; 95% CI, 1.66­3.02%) than female
children (1.86%; 95% CI, 1.11­3.12%). The
prevalence of CD was also higher among chil-
dren 13­15 years of age than among children
< 13 years of age.
The mean CD symptom count (Table 2)
for all U.S. children 8­15 years of age was
0.60 (95% CI, 0.54­0.67). Children who
met DSM-IV criteria for CD had, on average,
6.26 (95% CI, 5.70­6.83) symptoms in the
past year, whereas children without CD had
0.49 (95% CI, 0.44­0.53) symptoms. Mean
symptom counts were higher among male
children, older children, and those exposed to
environmental toxicants (Table 2).
Among children with cotinine levels  10
ng/mL, 79.1% had detectable cotinine levels.
Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure was moder-
ately correlated with the presence of a smoker
in the home and the number of cigarettes
smoked in the home (Spearman rank r =
0.36­0.38). Serum cotinine levels were mod-
erately correlated (Spearman rank r = 0.31)
with prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and
highly correlated with self-reported tobacco
exposures (Spearman rank r = 0.60). All chil-
dren (100%) living with a smoker in the
home had detectable serum cotinine levels
(> 0.015 ng/mL). Among children whose par-
ents did not report a smoker in the home,
74.0% had detectable cotinine levels.
In multivariable analyses, both prenatal
and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke and
children's blood lead levels were significantly
associated with meeting DSM-IV criteria for
CD when adjusted for covariates (Table 3).
Children exposed to prenatal tobacco smoke
had a 3.00-fold higher odds of CD than did
nonexposed children (95% CI, 1.36­6.63).
An increase in blood lead levels (fourth vs.
first quartile) was associated with an 8.64-fold
(95% CI, 1.87­40.04) increased odds of
meeting DSM-IV CD criteria. Children with
serum cotinine levels in the fifth quintile had
a 9.15-fold (95% CI, 1.47­56.90) increased
odds of meeting DSM-IV CD criteria com-
pared with children with serum cotinine lev-
els below the LOD (0.015 ng/mL).
Poisson regression models showed that
exposure to tobacco smoke and children's
blood lead concentrations were associated
with increased number of CD symptoms
among children. Children with prenatal

tobacco smoke exposure had 1.68 (95% CI,
1.14­2.48) times as many CD symptoms as
did unexposed children (Table 4). Children
with higher serum cotinine levels showed an
increasing number of CD symptoms com-
pared with children with nondetectable coti-
nine levels. Children with higher blood lead
levels also showed an elevated number of CD
symptoms compared with children in the
lowest blood lead quartile.
Figure 1 shows the mean number of
symptoms among children without any pre-
natal tobacco smoke exposure. Children with
serum cotinine levels in the fifth quintile had
2.23 times (95% CI, 1.21, 4.11) as many
symptoms as did children in the first quintile
of cotinine exposure. The exclusion of chil-
dren with blood lead levels  10 µg/dL did
not substantially alter the effect estimates of
environmental lead exposure in either our
logistic or Poisson regression models.
Discussion
Overall, 2.06% of children surveyed met
DSM-IV criteria for CD in the past 12 months,
equivalent to 560,000 U.S. children 8­15 years
of age. This estimate is consistent with previous
prevalence estimates that range from < 1.0% to
16.0% (Lahey et al. 2000; Loeber et al. 2000;
Maughan et al. 2004). Our analyses confirm
prior observations that prenatal tobacco smoke
exposure is associated with disruptive behavior
disorders in children. We also found increases
in the number of CD symptoms among chil-
dren exposed to postnatal ETS. Finally, we
found that lead exposure, measured using blood
lead levels, was associated with increased odds
of CD and increased CD symptom count in
the past year.
Our results are the first to use a DSM-
IV­based instrument to assess conduct prob-
lems in a nationally representative sample of
U.S. children. Previous work evaluated small
to moderately sized case­control sets or
prospective cohorts using behavior scales such
as the CBCL (Needleman et al. 1996;
Wasserman et al. 2001), self- or parent report
of delinquent behavior (Dietrich et al. 2001;
Needleman et al. 1996), or adjudicated case
status (Needleman et al. 2002). Estimates of
the prevalence of CD may differ across stud-
ies because of variations in diagnostic instru-
ment, informant, time period for assessing
psychiatric status, and source population. As
noted by Lahey et al. (1999), small changes in
the diagnostic instrument can produce large
changes in the prevalence. When criteria of
the 3rd, revised edition of the DSM were
used, the prevalence of CD in three U.S.-
based samples ranged from 1.2% to 16.0%,
depending on the age and sex of the children.
When DSM-IV criteria were used, the preva-
lence of CD has been reported to be 1.3% for
girls and 3.9% for boys (Loeber et al. 2000).
We did not find differences in the prevalence
of CD diagnosis between boys (2.24%) and
girls (1.86%) to be as large as previously
reported (Loeber et al. 2000). This may be a
result of using parents as the informants of
CD symptoms.
In this sample, children with prenatal
tobacco smoke exposure had elevated odds of
meeting DSM-IV CD criteria, which is con-
sistent with previous reports (Fergusson et al.
1998; Wakschlag et al. 1997; Weissman et al.
1999). Using DSM-IV criteria, Fergusson
et al. (1998) reported a 1.4- to 2.5-fold
increase in CD symptom rate among children
whose mothers smoked more than one pack
of cigarettes per day during pregnancy, which
is consistent with the increase in CD symp-
toms we observed among children exposed to
prenatal tobacco smoke. However, unlike our
study, Fergusson et al. (1998) did not find an
association between maternal smoking during
pregnancy and CD diagnosis after controlling
for confounding. The difference in our results
may be attributable to differences in the con-
founders that were controlled for. Fergusson
et al. (1998) controlled for illicit drug and
alcohol use during pregnancy, child-rearing
practices, and family functioning. Our
reported effect estimates may have been atten-
uated had we been able to adjust for these
other confounders.
Children with increasing cotinine levels
had increased odds of meeting DSM-IV CD

symptoms. This association was not a result of

smoking children because we excluded all chil-
dren with serum cotinine levels indicative of
active smoking ( 10 ng/mL). Our result is
consistent with previous prospective cohort
studies that have found similar increases in
behavior problems (Weitzman et al. 1992)
and CD (Fergusson et al. 1993) associated
with postnatal ETS exposure. Fergusson et al.
(1998) reported that postnatal ETS exposure
was associated with increased CD symptoms
at 8, 10, and 12 years of age, using parent
informants. Weitzman et al. (1992) reported
increased scores on the Behavior Problem
Index of the CBCL among children whose
mothers smoked only after pregnancy. Our
study is the first to use an objective biomarker
of tobacco smoke exposure to examine the
association between postnatal ETS exposure
and severe behavior problems among children.
Our results indicate that a substantial pro-
portion of children are exposed to ETS out-
side of the home, leading to elevated serum
cotinine levels. Previous studies have reported
similar findings (Boyaci et al. 2006; Cornelius
et al. 2003). Future studies would be well
advised to use cotinine as a measure of ETS
exposure in children given the high likelihood
of exposure misclassification.
Children with blood lead levels  1.5 µg/dL
had a 8.64-fold increased odds of having met
DSM-IV CD criteria in the past year com-
pared with children with levels from 0.2 to
0.7 µg/dL. Our findings, which are consistent
with prior research showing an increased risk
of delinquency and criminality among chil-
dren with higher bone or blood lead levels
(Dietrich et al. 2001; Needleman et al. 1996,
2002; Wasserman et al. 2001), provide evi-
dence that contemporary children with con-
siderably lower levels of lead exposure than
those in previous studies remain at increased
risk for CD. However, the results of our logis-
tic regression models were very imprecise
because of the small number of cases.
The relationship between environmental
toxicant exposure and disruptive behavior dis-
orders is not surprising given the wealth of
animal literature showing adverse effects of
nicotine and lead exposure on behavior (Ernst
et al. 2001; Lidsky and Schneider 2003). It
has been hypothesized that tobacco smoke
exposure elicits its neurotoxic effects through
two mechanisms: a) fetal hypoxia as a result of
carbon monoxide exposure and b) the direct
interaction of nicotine with the developing
brain (Wakschlag et al. 2002). Exposure to
lead has been observed to cause changes in
neurotransmitter concentrations and neuro-
transmitter receptor density (Lidsky and
Schneider 2003). Nicotine interacts with nico-
tinic acetylcholine receptors, which are present
in the developing fetal brain. These receptors
are involved in the modulation of neurotrans-
mitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and
-amino butyric acid. Thus, prenatal nicotine
exposure may produce secondary effects
through these other systems (Ernst et al.
2001). Slotkin et al. (1987) proposed that
nicotine exposure is associated with regional
abnormalities in cell number and macromole-
cule content in rats. In addition, he found that
prenatal exposure to nicotine results in a pre-
mature switch from cell replication to cell dif-
ferentiation. Animal models using rats and
rhesus monkeys have shown that lead-exposed
animals exhibit deficits in discrimination
reversal, spatial delayed alternation, and fixed
interval tasks (Rice 1996, 2000). These
deficits indicate impairment in the animals'
ability to inhibit inappropriate responses, tem-
porally organize behavior, and learn from the
consequences of previous actions. Recent work

suggests that behavioral problems may be medi-
ated by child IQ or poor cognitive control.
This study has several limitations that
should be considered when interpreting our
results. First, the cross-sectional nature of the
data makes it difficult to infer causal relation-
ships. The results of our study are consistent
with previous birth cohorts that prospectively
collected exposure information (Dietrich et al.
2001; Fergusson et al. 1998; Weitzman et al.
1992). Concurrent blood lead levels may not
be the optimal biomarker of a child's risk for
lead-associated behavior problems if lead
induces neurotoxic effects during early devel-
opment. However, recent studies indicate that
concurrent blood lead level is a stronger pre-
dictor of lead-associated IQ decrements and
behavior problems than is blood lead meas-
ured during early childhood (Chen et al.
2005, 2007; Lanphear et al. 2005). Another
potential source of bias in cross-sectional data
is exposure misclassification. Mothers of chil-
dren with behavior problems may be more
likely to recall gestational intake of potentially
harmful substances, such as tobacco, owing to
a drive to identify a cause of their child's dis-
order. On the other hand, mothers may fail
to report prenatal and postnatal tobacco
smoke exposure because of social stigma (i.e.,
social desirability bias) or tobacco smoke
exposures outside of the home. We mini-
mized the possibility that postnatal ETS
exposures were misclassified by using cotinine
as a marker of exposure. Prior research indi-
cates that mothers can accurately recall gesta-
tion intake of tobacco with sensitivities and
specificities in the range of 0.81­0.86 and
0.94­0.97, respectively (Jacobson et al. 2002;
Tomeo et al. 1999).
Another limitation to the NHANES data
is that prenatal tobacco smoke exposure was
collected only as a dichotomous variable, and
we were unable to examine its relationship
with CD in more than two categories. This
would result in our effect estimate being biased
toward the null if the effect of prenatal tobacco
smoke exposure on CD diagnosis is greater at
higher levels of prenatal tobacco consumption.
Although we were able to adjust for some
confounders, we were unable to adjust for
maternal education, family functioning, care-
giving environment, parenting practices,
prenatal alcohol use, and parental psycho-
pathology. These factors tend to be associated
with greater exposure to environmental toxi-
cants and greater risk for CD. NHANES does
collect data on maternal education and prena-
tal alcohol use, but these data were not avail-
able in the public-use NHANES data files. We
did attempt to control for many confounders
(or their proxies) in the relationship between
environmental toxicants and CD, including
race/ethnicity, maternal age at child's birth,
and socioeconomic status (PIR). Still, it is
unlikely that these confounders would have
been strong enough to eliminate our observed
associations, given the previous literature show-
ing robust effects even after controlling for
numerous confounders.
Finally, the small number of exposed cases
in our logistic regression model created impre-
cise estimates of the effect of lead exposure and
limited our ability to adequately assess for an
interaction between prenatal tobacco smoke
exposure and blood lead levels. Still, the consis-
tency of our results using the CD symptom
counts suggests that exposure to environmental
toxins may result in a shift of the symptom
count distribution that would result in an
increased number of CD-diagnosed children.
The reported prevalence of CD may be an
underestimate of the true national prevalence
because we relied on parents as the infor-
mants of CD symptoms (Loeber et al. 2000;
Shaffer et al. 2000). Many disruptive or delin-
quent behaviors in children are not recog-
nized by their parents. Although maternal
and child report of CD symptoms are corre-
lated (Burt et al. 2005), some studies found
that child informants were twice as likely to
meet the diagnostic criteria for CD compared
with parent or caregiver informants (Ezpeleta
et al. 1997).
This study confirms the previously
observed associations between prenatal
tobacco smoke exposure and CD. In addition,
this study provides support that elevated blood
lead levels are a risk factor for CD. Future
research should be directed at confirming this
observation in prospective birth cohorts,
preferably using serial biomarkers of prenatal
tobacco smoke exposure and environmental
lead exposure. Despite dramatic reductions in
children's exposures to tobacco smoke and
environmental lead, these results suggest that
millions of contemporary children may be
exposed to levels of these toxicants sufficient
to increase the risk for persistent, disruptive,
and even violent behavior problems.
