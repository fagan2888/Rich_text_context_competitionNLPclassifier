Context.--Hearing loss in children influences the development of communica-
tion and behavioral skills, but few studies in the United States have used pure-tone
audiometry to derive hearing loss prevalence estimates for children.
Objective.--To describe the prevalence of hearing loss among US children by
sociodemographic characteristics, reported hearing loss, and audiometric screen-
ing factors.
Design.--National population-based cross-sectional survey with an in-person
interview and audiometric testing at 0.5 to 8 kHz.
Setting/Participants.--A total of 6166 children aged 6 to 19 years completed
audiometry in the mobile examination center of the Third National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey conducted between 1988 and 1994.
Main Outcome Measure.--Hearing loss, defined as audiometric threshold val-
ues of at least 16-dB hearing level based on a low or high pure-tone average.
Results.--A total of 14.9% of children had low-frequency or high-frequency
hearing loss of at least 16-dB hearing level, 7.1% had low-frequency hearing loss
of at least 16-dB hearing level, and 12.7% had high-frequency hearing loss of at
least 16-dB hearing level. Most hearing loss was unilateral and slight in severity (16-
to 25-dB hearing level). Of those with measured hearing loss, 10.8% were reported
to have current hearing loss during the interview.
Conclusions.--This analysis indicates that 14.9% of US children have low-
frequency or high-frequency hearing loss of at least 16-dB hearing level in 1 or both
ears. Among children in elementary, middle, and high school, audiometric screen-
ing should include low-frequency and high-frequency testing to detect hearing loss.

A CHILD'S ABILITY to hear influ-
ences the development of communica-
tion and behavioral skills that affect
educational experience and relation-
ships with other people.1,2 Public health
screening and intervention play an im-
portant role in improving the health (in-
cluding hearing status) and well-being
of children. Children are most often ad-
ministered audiometric evaluations at
speech frequencies as part of routine
physical examinations or in school set-
tings. The majority of conductive hear-
inglossaffectsthelowfrequencies,while
the majority of sensorineural hearing
loss affects the high frequencies.3 Im-
pacted cerumen, a foreign body, edema
of the auditory canal, and otitis media
are just a few of many possible causes of
conductive hearing loss among chil-
dren.2,3 Noise, medications, meningitis,
and congenital syphilis are among the
many possible causes of sensorineural
hearing loss among children.2,3 Studies
have shown that high-frequency hear-
ing loss from noise exposure during
childhoodcanleadtofurtherhearingloss
from acute or chronic noise exposure at
older ages.4
The effect of noise in the environment
on hearing levels has gained increased
recognition.5 In the United States, few
studies have included a range of high-
frequency audiometry (3 kHz) from
whichhearinglossprevalenceestimates
can be derived for children.6-9 Recent
data from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), conducted from 1988 to
1994 by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease
ControlandPrevention,offertheoppor-
tunity to examine both low and high au-
diometric frequencies and to evaluate
the presence of hearing loss by sociode-
mographic characteristics in a national
sample of children aged 6 to 19 years.
METHODS
NHANES III Sample Design
NHANES III used a stratified multi-
stage probability design.10 The sample
consistedofapproximately40 000people
who were representative of the US ci-
vilian noninstitutionalized population 2
months of age or older.10 National popu-
lation estimates, as well as estimates for
the3largestracialandethnicsubgroups
in the US population (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
American), can be derived from the 6-
year survey.10 Data were collected
through household interviews, and
standardized audiometric examinations
were conducted in a mobile examination
center.11 The NHANES III protocol for
audiometryincludedpersonsaged6to19
years, and did not include otoscopic ex-
aminations.
Audiometric Measures
Audiometry was conducted in a
sound-treatedroominthemobileexami-
nation center by trained examiners us-
ing a standardized protocol. An audiom-
eter(modelGSI16;Grason-Stadler,Mil-
ford, NH) was calibrated with the same
specificationsatthestartandendoftest-
ing at each field location.12 Additional
calibration audiometric equipment in-
cluded a sound level meter (model 2235;
B&K, Denmark), an artificial ear cou-

denser microphone (model 4144, B&K),
a 1.3-cm condenser microphone (model
4155,B&K),anoctavebandfilter(model
1624, B&K), an acoustic calibrator
(model 1624, B&K), an adapter (model
DB 0375, B&K), and a 500-g weight.12
Air-conduction thresholds were mea-
sured for each ear at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and
8 kHz, with testing repeated at 1 kHz.12
The correlation of the threshold for the
1-kHz first test with the retest was 0.9
(P.001) for the left and right ears of
each child. The 1-kHz first test was the
value used for this analysis.
If a subject had air-conduction thresh-
old values at a given frequency that dif-
fered by 40 dB or more between ears,
masking was performed to assure accu-
racy in measurement.13 Threshold values
were obtained between -10- and 110-dB
hearinglevel(dBHL).Ifnoresponsewas
obtained at the limits of the test protocol,
a threshold of 105-dB HL was recorded
for statistical purposes.13 In this sample,
106 children (1.7%) had masking per-
formed. If present, the masked values
were used for this analysis.
Sociodemographic Variables and
Hearing-Related Covariates
Age at interview was categorized as 6
to 11 years or 12 to 19 years. Race-eth-
nicity was grouped as non-Hispanic
black, non-Hispanic white, or Mexican
American.The"allother"race-ethnicity
category (eg, other Hispanics, Asians,
and Native Americans) was too small to
beanalyzedseparately,butwasincluded
in all totals.14 These 4 race-ethnicity
groups are mutually exclusive. The pov-
erty-income ratio (PIR) was defined as
the total family income divided by the
povertythreshold, as determined by the
US Bureau of the Census, for the year of
the interview.14 To be consistent with
major government food assistance pro-
grams that use a PIR cutoff of 1.3 to de-
termine eligibility, PIR categories used
in analyses were low (PIR  1.3), middle
(1.3PIR3.5),andhigh(PIR3.5).14
Nofamilyincomedatawereavailablefor
8.6% of the children tested.
Self-reported hearing status was de-
termined from questions administered
during the household interview to par-
entsorguardiansofchildrenaged6to16
years. Youths aged 17 to 19 years were
also asked about hearing status as part
of the adult questionnaire during the
household interview. Prior to the audio-
metric examination, a screening ques-
tionnairewasadministeredtodetermine
testexclusionsandtoassessfactorsthat
may affect test results (draining ears,
cold, sinus or earache problems, expo-
sure to music through use of earphones
or headphones, and exposure to very
loudnoisewithinthepast24hours).Par-
ents or guardians responded to these
questionsforchildrenaged6to12years.
Youths aged 13 to 19 years responded
for themselves. Responses to the house-
hold interview and screening questions
were dichotomized into yes and no cat-
egories.
Analytic Sample
Of the 6908 children aged 6 to 19 years
who were interviewed in NHANES III,
6497 children (94.1%) were also exam-
ined. Children who were interviewed
but not examined did not differ by age,
sex,race-ethnicity,orPIRfromchildren
who wereinterviewedandexamined.Of
the6497childrenexaminedinNHANES
III, 331 (5.1%) were excluded from our
analyses because they missed all audio-
metric items (n=256), had only 1 ear
tested (n=36), or had other incomplete
audiometric testing (n=39). Of the 331
children excluded from this analysis, 44
were excluded from audiometry on the
ear(s) with drainage per the NHANES
III protocol.11,12 Children with incom-
pletedatadidnotdifferbyage,sex,race-
ethnicity, or PIR from children with
complete data. A total of 6166 children
were available for analysis.
Analysis
The traditional pure-tone average
(PTA) for speech-affected frequencies
was calculated by averaging thresholds
per ear obtained at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz, and
was labeled as the low pure-tone aver-
age (LPTA) for this report.2,15 A high
pure-tone average (HPTA) was calcu-
lated by averaging thresholds per ear
obtained at frequencies of 3, 4, and 6
kHz.15,16 For this report, low-frequency
hearing loss (LFHL) was defined as
LPTA of at least 16-dB HL, and high-
frequency hearing loss (HFHL) was de-
finedasHPTAofatleast16-dBHL.Low
pure-tone averages and HPTAs were
also grouped into finer categories of
hearing capacity2,17: normal (-10- to 15-
dB HL), slight loss (16- to 25-dB HL),
mild loss (26- to 40-dB HL), moderate
loss(41-to65-dBHL),severeloss(66-to
95-dB HL), and profound loss ( 96-dB
HL). Because of the very small numbers
in these finer categories, the categories
were collapsed. Categories of hearing
were examined by left and right ear, and
by better ear (ear with lower PTA) and
worse ear (ear with higher PTA). The
better ear definition includes children
with unilateral hearing loss as normal,
whereas the worse ear definition does
not. Hearing thresholds were evaluated
at each tested frequency. The worse ear
HPTAs and LPTAs were examined by
reportedsociodemographiccharacteris-
tics. Reported hearing loss and re-
sponses to the audiometric screening
questions were analyzed by the catego-
ries of low-frequency and high-fre-
quency hearing loss. Odds ratios for the
risk of hearing loss were calculated for
the screening questions.
Allprevalenceestimatesand95%con-
fidence intervals were derived using
SUDAAN,astatisticalpackagecompat-
ible with SAS that accounts for the com-
plex survey design and weights.18,19 In
estimating the number of children in the
US population with hearing loss, we ad-
justed estimates to the 1991 US census
data for the population of children aged
6 to 19 years.14
RESULTS
The prevalence of either LFHL or
HFHL of at least 16-dB HL in 1 or both
ears among US children was 14.9% (7
millionchildren).Theprevalenceofboth
LFHL and HFHL was 4.9%. The preva-
lence of LFHL was 7.1% (1.5% bilateral
and 5.6% unilateral) (Table 1). Of all chil-
dren, the proportion with slight LFHL
in either ear was 5.7% (Table 1), mild
to moderate was 1.4%, and severe to
profound was 0.3%. The prevalence of
HFHL was 12.7% (3.1% bilateral and
9.6%unilateral)(Table2).Ofallchildren,
the proportion with slight HFHL in ei-
ther ear was 10.5% (Table 2), mild to
moderate was 2.6%, and severe to pro-
found was 0.4%.
Based on the better ear, 1.3% to 2.8%
of all children had hearing loss of at least
16-dB HL at the individual frequencies
of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz. The prevalence
ofhearinglossinthebetterearwashigh-
est at 6 kHz (5.8%) and 8 kHz (7.6%).
Based on the worse ear, 5.5% to 10.6% of
all children had hearing loss at 0.5, 1, 2, 3,
and 4 kHz (Table 3). The prevalence of

(Table 3).
Thehearinglossprevalenceestimates
based on the worse ear for LFHL and
HFHL by various sociodemographic
characteristics are presented in Table 4.
Overall,therewaslittlevariabilityinthe
prevalence of LFHL by sex, age group,
race-ethnicity,orPIR.Therewere,how-
ever,somepronounceddifferencesinthe
prevalence of HFHL by sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. The prevalence
of HFHL was higher among males than
females (Table 4). The prevalence of
HFHL in the age group of 6 to 11 years
didnotdifferbysex.However,intheage
groupof12to19years,theprevalenceof
HFHLwas15.9%formalesascompared
with 10.3% for females. The prevalence
of HFHL differed only slightly by race-
ethnicity (Table 4). Mexican American
children had the highest prevalence of
HFHL (15.1%) as compared with non-
Hispanic black children (11.7%) and non-
Hispanic white children (12.3%). Chil-
dren from low-income families had
greater HFHL (16.3%) than either chil-
drenfrommiddle-incomefamilies(12.7%)
or high-income families (7.9%), as pre-
sented in Table 4.
Of those children who had measured
LFHL or HFHL of at least 16-dB HL,
only 10.8% were reported to have cur-
rent hearing loss at the time of house-
hold interview. Of the 3.4% of children
whowerereportedtohavecurrenthear-
ing loss, almost half had measured
LFHL or HFHL. However, of children
who were reported to have normal hear-
ing, 13.8% had measured hearing loss at
thetimeofaudiometrictesting(6.0%had
LFHL and 11.6% had HFHL).
The prevalence of responses to audio-
metric screening questions are reported
in Table 5. These results are limited to
children who had reported answers to
the screening questions. Use of head-
phonesorearphonestolistentoloudmu-
sic in the past 24 hours was reported by
10.2%, and exposure to a loud noise in
the past 24 hours was reported by 6.0%.
These 2 factors did not appear to affect
the prevalence of measured LFHL or
HFHL. The presence of a cold or sinus
problem the day of audiometric testing
wasreportedby14.8%,andthepresence
of buzzing or ringing in the ear(s) on the
day of audiometric testing was reported
by 3.2%. Children with these 2 factors
had a higher prevalence of measured
LFHL but not of measured HFHL. The
presence of an earache in the past week
was reported by 3.7%, and the presence
of tube(s) in the ear(s) was reported by
1.6%. Children with these 2 factors had a
higher prevalence of LFHL and HFHL
than children without these conditions
or symptoms. For example, children re-
portedtohavehadanearacheinthepast
week were 3 times more likely to have
LFHL than children who were not re-
portedtohavehadanearacheinthepast
week.
COMMENT
This study estimated hearing ability
in a range of 0.5 to 8 kHz in a sample that
isrepresentativeoftheUSpopulationof
children aged 6 to 19 years. The data
from NHANES III demonstrate that
approximately 14.9% (more than 7 mil-
lion) of US children have LFHL or
HFHL of at least 16-dB HL. The major-
ity of hearing loss was determined to be
unilateral and slight with respect to se-
verity. Unilateral hearing loss in chil-
dren impacts speech perception, learn-
ing, self-image, and social skills.1 Slight
hearing loss affects children in class-
rooms and other reverberant listening
environments in which a child with tran-
sient auditory dysfunction can have dif-
ficulty perceiving and understanding
speech sounds.1,2 Children with unilat-
eral hearing loss or with slight hearing
loss may require interventions such as
speech therapy and consideration of the
need for a hearing aid.1,2 Because the

decibel change in a child's hearing
threshold at any frequency can signifi-
cantly affect that child's ability to hear.4
The measurement of hearing thresh-
olds at low and high frequencies for both
ears provides an extensive assessment
ofachild'sabilitytohearclear,distorted,
quiet, and noisy sounds that are a part of
the everyday environment.20,21 Children
with conductive hearing loss may have
difficulty hearing low frequencies such
as human speech, while children with
sensorineural hearing loss may have dif-
ficulty hearing high frequencies such as
doorbells, telephones, or a high-pitched
voice.2,3 In this analysis, the proportion
ofchildrenexhibitingHFHLwashigher
than that of children exhibiting LFHL.
Althoughthisanalysisdidnotdetermine
the etiology of hearing loss, the affected
frequencies are described.
As in previous studies, this study
shows unilateral hearing loss (hearing
loss in only 1 ear) to be more prevalent
among children than bilateral hearing
loss(hearinglossinbothears).16,22 Preva-
lence estimates of hearing loss that are
basedonmeasurementsinthebetterear
define children with unilateral hearing
loss as having normal hearing. There-
fore, estimates of hearing loss that are
based on measurements in the worse
ear, as used in Table 4 of this report,
may be a more accurate indicator of
the number of US children who need in-
tervention at home and school to pre-
vent hearing loss from impairing their
development.16,23
Of those children who had measured
LFHL or HFHL, only 10.8% reported
having current hearing loss at the time
of the household interview. This differ-
ence may be explained by several fac-
tors. First, a child with transient or tem-
porary hearing loss at the time of audio-
metric testing may not have had the
hearing loss at the time of the household
interview, which could have been as
many as 8 weeks prior to the examina-
tion. In addition, a child may have had
temporary or transient hearing loss at
the time of the interview, but not at the
time of the examination. Second, hear-
ing loss was reported by a parent or
guardian for youths aged 6 to 16 years
andthus,maynothavereflectedthetrue
hearingstatusasrecognizedbythechild.
Third, because the majority of detected
hearing loss was in the slight range, par-
ents, as well as children aged 17 to 19
years who answered questions on hear-
ing loss for themselves, may not have
recognized hearing loss.1,24 Although
some children do not recognize hearing
loss, these children may be missing
listening information and are at risk
for learning disabilities.1,2 The overall
prevalence of hearing difficulty by self-
report (3.4%) from the NHANES III
household interview is almost double
that found in the 1990-1991 National
Health Interview Survey Hearing
Supplements for children aged 3 to 17
years (1.8%).25
Otherstudieshavereportedresultsof
high-frequency testing9,24; however, to
our knowledge, no nationally represen-
tative study has examined hearing at
high frequencies in children since the
National Health Examination Surveys
(NHES) conducted from 1963 to 1970.7,8
The documentation of the results of
NHES audiometric testing are present-
ed in a different format with different
definitions and methods than the pres-
entstudy.Thus,theresultsofthisanaly-
sis cannot be compared with docu-
mented analyses of NHES audiometric
data. Caution should be used when com-
paring results of hearing loss studies be-
causeofthevariationsusedindetermin-
ing screening methods and definitions of
hearing loss (eg, different age ranges,
frequencies tested, decibel levels used
to screen, and some studies only include
the better ear).
The following findings are in agree-
mentwithourresultsthatmorechildren
have hearing loss in high frequencies
than in low frequencies. Holmes et al9
found that 7% of 342 Florida students
sampled (aged 10-20 years) had hearing
lossofatleast25-dBHLattheindividual
frequencies of 1, 2, and 4 kHz in 1 or both
ears, and 17% had hearing loss when 6
kHz was included. These findings are
similar to our findings that 7.1% of US
children aged 6 to 19 years had either
unilateral or bilateral LFHL, and 12.7%
had HFHL. Cozad et al24 found that
10.6% of their sample of children aged 6
to 18 years in Kansas had hearing loss
greater than 10-dB HL at the individual
frequencies of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8
kHz in 1 or both ears, with 34.4% of the
10.6% failing low-frequency screening
and 64.6% of the 10.6% failing high-fre-
quency screening.
Including3,4,and6kHzforaudiomet-
ric screening and PTA calculations re-
sults in a more accurate measurement of
hearing loss throughout childhood and
adolescence, especially among those
children who do not recognize that they
havehearingloss.4,15,16,24,26,27 Hearingloss
may be detected early by looking at each
tested frequency, particularly for noise-
induced hearing loss, which initially in-
volves 1 or more frequencies in the 3- to
6-kHz range.4 The audiometric screen-
ing questions regarding noise did not
show an association with temporary
threshold shifts. However, historically,
noise-induced hearing loss is the most
common cause of permanent HFHL.3
Exposure to very loud noises may ex-
plain the prevalence of HFHL (low fre-
quencies are initially unaffected by
noise).3,4,15,16,20 Persons with hearing loss
in the high frequencies need to be ad-
vised as to appropriate hearing protec-
tion and methods to minimize noise ex-
posure(eg,earplugsatanoisyconcertor
in shop class).28

and may explain why 3.7% of all children
were reported to have had an earache in
the past week. Due to the absence of an
otoscopic examination, temporary or
transient hearing loss due to an ob-
structedauditorycanal(eg,impactedce-
rumen) could not be determined. Con-

ductive hearing losses due to pathology
in the outer and middle ear are usually
temporary and can fluctuate greatly.28,29
Nonetheless they can have detrimental
effects educationally and on the devel-
opmentofspeechandlanguage.1,31 These
hearing losses need to be treated medi-
cally to afford the child the advantages
of better hearing.29,30
More studies are needed to look at so-
ciodemographiccharacteristicsandhear-
ing loss. The findings of this study are
consistent with other findings that male
adolescents have a greater prevalence of
HFHL than do females.1,24 Although this
studyfoundnodifferencebyrace-ethnic-
ity for LFHL, Mexican American chil-
drenhadmoreHFHLthannon-Hispanic
whiteornon-Hispanicblackchildren.Lee
et al31 found that Mexican American chil-
dren (2.8%) have more bilateral LFHL
thanAfricanAmericanchildren(1.7%)or
non-Hispanic white children (1.6%). Our
results also show children with low PIRs
to have more HFHL than children with
middle or high PIRs. However, PIR is a
variable that other hearing loss studies
need to explore.
Thescreeningquestionsadministered
the day of the audiometric examination
weredesignedtoassessfactorsthatmay
affect hearing status. The use of head-
phones or earphones in the past 24 hours
and exposure to loud noise in the past 24
hours did not appear to affect the preva-
lence of measured LFHL or HFHL.
Children who were reported to have a
cold or sinus problem on the day of the
examination had a marginally higher
prevalenceofLFHL.Childrenwhowere
reported to have buzzing or ringing in
the ear(s) on the day of the examination
had a higher prevalence of LFHL. How-
ever, children who reported having had
an earache in the past week or tube(s) in
the ear(s)on the day of the examination
had a higher prevalence of LFHL and
HFHL. A child with a tube in an ear is
most likely being treated for chronic ear
infections.2 Because of the limitations of
the survey, we cannot discern what pro-
portionofchildrenhavetemporaryhear-
ing loss.
The results of this study suggest a
need for further research to explain dif-
ferencesintheprevalenceofhearingloss
in high frequencies among children by
age group, sex, race-ethnicity, and PIR.
These differences may be related to
variations in environmental exposures
(eg, noisy hobbies, smoking).22,23,32 Fur-
ther studies also are needed to assess
differences in hearing thresholds over
time. Currently, hearing screening in
schools is commonly performed in el-
ementary grades at 1, 2, and 4 kHz.1 If
hearing loss is identified early, particu-
larly when it may be due to factors such
as noise exposure, education and coun-
seling may help prevent educational dif-
ficulties and further potentially handi-
capping hearing loss from developing,
and may help maintain residual hear-
ing.1,2,28 With 14.9% of US children aged
6 to 19 years having LFHL or HFHL in
1 or both ears, audiometric screening
should include low-frequency testing
(0.5, 1, and 2 kHz) and high-frequency
testing(3,4,and6kHz)todetecthearing
loss among children in elementary,
middle, and high school.
