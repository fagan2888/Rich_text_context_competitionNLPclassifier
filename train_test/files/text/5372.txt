Introduction
Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs can be harmful or even fatal
if consumers do not pay close attention to the information
provided on the OTC label about uses, contra-indications,
interactions with other drugs, potential side effects, and
appropriate dosage levels and intervals."Therapeutic
errors" in self-medicating with both nonprescription and
prescription drugs have been shown to account for as many
as 10percent of the 2million unintentional "drug exposure
calls" to poison control centers in the United States
(Bronstein etal., 2009). OTC drugs that pose health threats
if not taken as directed by the drug label include analgesic,
laxative, antihistamine, cough suppressant, and heartburn
medications. Given the potential risks of self-medication
with nonprescription drugs, OTC drug labels are obligated
to provide a consumer with the information needed to use
that drug safely and effectively (Soller, 1998; Sutherland,
2010). Toward that end, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA, 1999) has standardized the organization, format, and
reading level of label information as the now-familiar Drug
Facts Label (DFL). In addition, the FDA mandates compre-
hension studies for all nonprescription drug labels (FDA,
2010; Morris etal., 1998). Nonetheless, consumers often
ignore or misunderstand label information that would ena-
ble them to use a drug safely and effectively (Bennin and
Rother, 2014; Lokker etal., 2009; Wolf etal., 2007). These
reading failures may arise from deficiencies in the quality
of the label text (Bailey etal., 2015; Schwartz etal., 2007;
Shrank etal., 2007; Smith etal., 2011) or from deficiencies
in the quality of a consumer's comprehension skills (Davis
et
al., 2006; Morris and Aikin, 2001; Pawaskar and
Sansgiry, 2006).
Prior knowledge effects may also underlie some of the
problems that consumers have in making sense of simple
label directives. As an illustration, consider Davis etal.'s
(2006) report of a study participant who responded to the
Under what conditions can a
nonprescription drug label serve as
refutation text? The role of directed
attention and processing strategy

Abstract
Nonprescription drug labels are relatively ineffective in refuting drug misconceptions. We sought to improve the
effectiveness of an aspirin label as a refutation text by manipulating selective attention and label-processing strategy.
After reading a facsimile label, those of 196 undergraduates who attempted to explain why shaded drug facts are "easily
confused" recalled more refuting drug facts than participants who attempted to explain why those facts are "easily
ignored." However, "easily confused" processing did not change truth ratings of misconceptions associated with those
drug facts. We conclude that refuted misconceptions remain in memory but are inhibited by disconfirming drug facts.

warning label directive "DO NOT CRUSH OR CHEW--
SWALLOW WHOLE" by explaining that one should
"chew it up so it will dissolve, don't swallow whole or you
might choke." Conceivably, this misunderstanding might
reflect inattention, low health literacy, or a poorly worded
directive. However, this misunderstanding might also
reflect the heightened concern of a mother of three young
children about the potential risk of a choking hazard.
Mindful of that concern, she might well infer that she could
reduce the risk of choking by thoroughly crushing and
chewing the tablet. In re-interpreting the label directive, she
has reconciled the discrepancy between her prior knowl-
edge and the authoritative text of the label in favor of her
prior knowledge. Under other circumstances, she might
have reconciled the discrepancy in favor of the authorita-
tive label directive. This example suggests that substantial
improvements in the comprehension of OTC drug labels
may require the modification of naïve preconceptions con-
sumers have about the safe and effective use of nonpre-
scription drugs.
There is a small body of research that documents knowl-
edge-based reading failures (Bostrom et al., 1994; Catlin
etal., 2015; Ellen etal., 1998; Jungermann etal., 1988;
Lokker etal., 2009; Ryan, 2011; Shone etal., 2011). The
clearest demonstration is that by Ryan (2011) and Ryan and
Costello-White (2015). Their methodology involves a pre-
test­posttest assessment of truth ratings assigned to a set of
30 claims about the facts to be found on a facsimile aspirin
label. Of these 30 claims, 15 could be readily confirmed by
reading the aspirin label; the remaining 15 could be readily
refuted by reading the label. A careful reading of the fac-
simile label produced a substantial increase in the judged
truth of label-supported claims (LSCs) on the posttest. That
reading also produced a significant decrease in the judged
truth of label-refuted claims (LRCs) on the posttest. In both
studies, however, the increase in truth values for LSCs was
much greater than the decrease in truth values for LRCs.
These results demonstrate that individuals are better at
using label information to confirm valid claims about aspi-
rin drug facts than in using label information to correct
invalid claims about aspirin drug facts. The disturbing
implication is that reading an OTC label very carefully may
be effective in confirming valid naïve beliefs about a drug
but relatively ineffective in correcting invalid naïve beliefs.
Correcting misconceptions that impair text comprehen-
sion can be challenging enough to require specialized texts
that are capable of producing conceptual change (see Duit
and Treagus, 2015; Vosniadou, 2013, for comprehensive
reviews in different scientific domains). Science educators
have long recognized that students often have naïve scien-
tific misconceptions that are not easily corrected (see
McCloskey, 1983; Winer etal., 2002). For example, even
college graduates may hold strongly to the mistaken belief
that it is warmer in the summer than in the winter because the
sun is closer to the earth (Bailey and Slater, 2004). Science
texts that are designed specifically to dispel common scien-
tific misconceptions are generally referred to as refutational
texts. In her review of the literature, Tippett (2010: 953)
notes that refutation texts are most effective in correcting a
misconception when they (a) clearly articulate the miscon-
ception, (b) label it unambiguously as incorrect, and (c) cor-
rect the misconception with an explanation of the relevant
scientific principle. More recently, investigations of the co-
activation hypothesis (Kendeou etal., 2014; Danielson et al.,
2016; McCrudden and Kendeou, 2014; Van Den Broek and
Kendeou, 2008) have sought to identify the specific cogni-
tive processes necessary to produce texts that promote the
conceptual change necessary to modify naïve misconcep-
tions. The co-activation hypothesis assumes that a necessary
condition for conceptual change is that a given misconcep-
tion and the corrective information offered by a text be
simultaneously active in working memory. In addition, how-
ever, the text must prompt a reader to revise or replace the
invalid memory-based conception with the valid text-based
conception. The question we investigate in this study is
whether it is possible to design a refutational DFL that is
effective in correcting drug misconceptions and in improv-
ing the recall of the corrective information on the label.
Design constraints in creating refutational OTC
drug labels
Unfortunately, the content and format of a nonprescription
drug facts label is so highly constrained (FDA, 1999) that it
is difficult to devise a refutational DFL using either the sci-
ence education formula (Tippett, 2010) or the co-activation
formula (Kendeou etal., 2014). However, there are two
DFL features than can be manipulated: the use of a con-
spicuous general injunction to the consumer and the shad-
ing of critical label phrases. For example, the general
injunction "See new warnings information" now appears
on the Principal Display Panel (PDP: the front label that
includes brand name and product logos) for many nonpre-
scription drug labels. This injunction amounts only to a
general recommendation to read the label carefully to dis-
cover any new warning information. The PDPcould include
much more specific and useful label-processing directives.
A second re-design opportunity lies in making better use of
the selective shading of keywords or phrases on an OTC
label. Leat etal. (2014) report that 24
percent of the pre-
scription drug labels examined in their study made use of
gray highlighting to emphasize information that was not
"patient-critical." A feasible and more patient-critical use
of shading would be to highlight on a nonprescription drug
label those keywords or phrases associated with each
Primary Communication Objective established by the FDA
for that drug. Because there are only about a dozen Primary
Communication Objectives for any nonprescription drug
(see Raymond et
al., 2002, Table 3), such highlighting
would not likely compromise the label-reading process.
Ryan et al. 3
Controlling attentional focus.We used label shading to focus
participants'attention on keywords associated with label drug
facts that confirmed valid claims about the safe and effective
use of aspirin--claim-supporting drug facts (CSDFs). We
also used label shading to focus participants'attention on key-
words associated with drug facts that refuted invalid claims
about the safe and effective use aspirin--claim-refuting drug
facts (CRDFs). Figure 1 shows the seven shadings of key-
words for claim-supporting drug facts on a facsimile Drug
Facts Panel. Figure 2 shows the seven shadings of keywords
for claim-refuting drug facts on the same Drug Facts Panel.
Participants were randomly assigned to read either a facsimile
label (a PDP and two Drug Facts Panels) with the 15 CSDFs
shaded or a facsimile label with the 15 CRDFs shaded. It
should be noted that shading only CSDFs (as in Figure 1) will
direct participants' attention to those drug facts and reduce
their attention to CRDFs. Similarly, shading only CRDFs (as
in Figure 2) will direct participants' attention to those drug
facts and reduce their attention to CSDFs. As a consequence,
less attention will be paid to unshaded drug facts than if no
shading were used, and more attention will be paid to shaded
drug facts than if no shading was used.
Promoting label/belief discrepancy detection and label reconcili-
ation. We expected that keyword shading would focus our
participants' attention on the associated drug facts in the
label text and serve to activate whatever preconceptions
they had about those drug facts. Our analysis of pre-label
ratings suggests that in the aggregate, the shading of claim-
supporting drug facts (see Figure 1) are likely to activate
label-supported preconceptions, and the shading of claim-
refuting drug facts are likely to activate label-refuted pre-
conceptions (see Figure 2). According to the co-activation
hypothesis (McCrudden and Kendeou, 2014; Van Den
Broek and Kendeou, 2008), it would be necessary for a
misconception and its corrective drug fact to be active in
working memory simultaneously in order for differences
between the two to be detected and reconciled. We sought
to devise a processing strategy that would likely facilitate
the detection and reconciliation of discrepancies between
activated preconceptions and shaded drug facts. We also
sought to devise a control processing strategy that would be
less likely to facilitate the detection and reconciliation of
discrepancies. We identified two semantic processing strat-
egies that seemed likely to vary in their effectiveness in
correcting misconceptions.
"Easily-confused" label processing.If we ask participants to
explain a why consumer might misunderstand or be con-
fused by a particular shaded drug fact, we encourage them
to engage in both elaborative and distinctiveness process-
ing. Elaborative processing occurs as participants seek to
generate different plausible interpretations of a drug,
including those based on their own preconceptions (Stein
and Bransford, 1979). Distinctiveness processing occurs as
participants seek to determine how different any generated
interpretation might differ from the interpretation most
consonant with the wording of the shaded drug fact (Jacoby
etal., 1979). This encoding strategy involves deep seman-
tic processing that is likely to promote the detection of dis-
crepancies between alternative interpretations and the most
veridical label­based interpretation. The emphasis upon
possible misinterpretations should also likely bias partici-
pants toward resolving any discrepancies in favor of the
interpretation that adheres most closely to the text of the
drug fact. As a consequence, easily-confused processing
should promote the refutation of misconceptions and the
recall of the CRDFs associated with those misconceptions.
"Easily-ignored" label processing.If we instead ask partici-
pants to explain why a consumer might disregard or ignore
a particular shaded drug fact, we encourage them to assess
the importance of that drug fact in relative isolation. Some
elaborative processing will occur as participants seek to
judge the relative significance of the shaded drug fact.
Some distinctiveness processing will also occur as partici-
pants seek to determine what evidence they have concern-
ing the authoritativeness of the shaded drug fact. Neither
form of processing promotes a direct consideration of pos-
sible misconceptions nor how they might be reconciled
with a label-based interpretation of the shaded drug fact. As
a consequence, easily-ignored processing should be less
likely than easily-confused processing to promote the refu-
tation of misconceptions and the recall of the CRDFs asso-
ciated with those misconceptions.
The encoding difference produced by easily-confused
and easily-ignored processing strategies will not be enacted
as we intend them to be if participants do not take the
instructions seriously. In order to increase that likelihood,
we asked our participants to spend 40seconds considering
each shaded drug fact and explaining in writing why it
might be confused or why it might be ignored. Numbered
lines were included at the bottom of each label facsimile for
these explanations to be recorded as participants were
paced through the reading of the aspirin label text (only
four of the seven numbered lines for the first Drug Facts
Panel are shown in Figures 1 and 2). The experimenter also
attempted to induce a demand bias by asking participants to
write very legibly so that their responses could be easily
classified.
Cued-recall of CRDFs. Label information may fail to correct a
mistaken belief about the safe and effective use of a nonpre-
scription drug because that belief biases the label compre-
hension process or because the label text fails to modify the
mistaken belief. If an individual simply misunderstands cor-
rective label information as supporting an existing mistaken
belief, then the accurate recall of that corrective information
should be compromised. However, if an individual fails to
use corrective label information to modify a mistaken belief

6 Health Psychology Open 
(see Van Den Broek and Kendeou, 2008), then the corrective
information may be accurately recalled even though the mis-
taken belief is retained. Therefore, the recall of corrective
label information provides useful information about why
nonprescription drug labels may fail to correct mistaken
beliefs. We assessed the recall of the 15 CRDFs that cor-
rected mistaken beliefs about aspirin by using a cued­recall
test rather than a free-recall test. Our cued recall test made
use of the keyword associated with each corrective drug fact
as a retrieval cue for that fact. For example, in both shading
and both processing conditions we provided menstrual pain
as a cue for the recall of the drug fact "Aspirin can be used
for the temporarily relief of menstrual pain." We did not use
a free-recall test ("recall all of the drug facts you can recall
from the aspirin label") because the cued recall test would be
a more sensitive measure of recall for the 15 CRDFs.Acued-
recall test also allows us to control the amount of time spent
in trying to recall a given drug fact and makes the recall task
more manageable for our participants.
Experimental design and hypotheses
We used a mixed analysis of covariance to analyze changes
in truth ratings for label-supported claims (LSCs) and label-
refuted claims (LRCs) as a function of reading the aspirin
label. We manipulated the between-groups factor Keyword
Shading to highlight CSDFs or CRDFs. We manipulated
the between-groups factor Processing Strategy to encour-
age Easily-Confused or Easily-Ignored label processing
(see Figures 1 and 2 for detailed examples). Trials (pretest
and posttest) served as the single within-groups factor.
Rather than including Claim Type (LSC or LRC) as a sec-
ond within-groups factor, we conducted separate analyses
of the label-supported and the label-refuted aspirin claims
in order to clarify and simplify our analyses. Our covariate
measures were designed to assess two components of health
literacy. One covariate is domain-specific knowledge of the
organization and format of nonprescription drug labels--
our assessment of DFL knowledge. The second covariate is
the extended-range vocabulary test we used as a surrogate
measure of general verbal ability. Because we used cued
recall only as a posttest measure, those data were analyzed
with a between-groups analysis of covariance with
Attentional Focus and Processing Strategy as our between-
groups factors and Label Format Knowledge and Verbal
Ability as our covariate measures.
Activation hypothesis. We hypothesize that our attentional-
focus manipulation will encourage participants to pay
close attention to claim-associated label information. We
hypothesize that pretest drug claims so targeted will be
modified by label processing to a greater degree than those
drug claims not so targeted. Ratings of LSCs should
increase, and ratings of LRCs should decrease.
Discrepancy reconciliation hypothesis.We hypothesize that
participants given easily-confused instructions will engage
in label-processing efforts that will focus them on the ways
in which LSCs are verified by supporting label drug facts,
and the ways in which LRCs are discredited by refuting
label drug facts. Such efforts are expected to promote the
detection of discrepancies between LRCs and CRDFs on
the facsimile label. Easily confused instructions are also
expected to focus participants on the reconciliation of
claim/label discrepancies. As a consequence, truth ratings
for shaded LSCs will increase and truth ratings for shaded
LRCs will decrease with easily-confused label processing,
while ratings for unshaded LSCs will increase significantly
less and ratings for unshaded LRCs will decrease signifi-
cantly less. In contrast, we hypothesize that participants
given easily-ignored instructions will focus on the salience
and interest value of drug facts in isolation rather than on
the degree to which they verify LSCs and discredit LRCs.
As a consequence, easily-ignored processing will increase
truth ratings for shaded and unshaded LSCs to a lesser
degree than will easily-confused processing. Easily-ignored
label processing will also decrease truth ratings for shaded
and unshaded LRCs to a lesser degree than will easily-con-
fused processing.
Cued recall hypothesis.Finally, we expected that CRDFs
would be most often recalled when their keywords have been
shaded (see Figures 1 and 2) and their associated LRCs have
been activated and reconciled with label information. The
cognitive effort associated with easily-confused processing
will promote elaborative and distinctiveness processing to a
greater degree than will the cognitive effort associated with
easily-ignored processing. As a result, recall for the CRDFs
should be greater with easily confused label processing. We
did not assess recall of claim-supporting drug facts because
the focus of the study is on refutational-processing effects.
Method
Figure 3 is a schematic representation of the sequence of
tasks in this study. The discussion below provides detailed
information about nature and purpose of each task.
Participants
In order to satisfy a research requirement in their introductory
psychology course, 170 female and 26 male students signed
up for the study using an online research-participation sys-
tem. Only self-reported native English speakers between the
ages of 18 and 24
years were recruited for the 50-minute,
small-group sessions. After signing the consent form for the
study, participants completed a short form that provided us
with information about their use of and preference for non-
prescription single-ingredient analgesics. The great majority
Ryan et al. 7
of our participants used nonprescription analgesics other than
aspirin. In total, 145 of them reported having used ibuprofen
in the previous 30
days, 98 reported using acetaminophen
during that period, 48 reported using naproxen, and 18
reported using aspirin. Only 6 participants reported aspirin to
be their preferred medication for pain relief, 114 reported a
preference for ibuprofen, 35 reported a preference for aceta-
minophen, and 33 reported a preference for naproxen.
Materials and measures
DFL knowledge.We created a 30-item true­false question-
naire that sampled participants' knowledge of both the nature
and ordering of information found on nonprescription drug
labels (FDA, 1999). Some items focused on their knowledge
of the ordering of label headings (e.g. "Warnings informa-
tion usually follows Uses information on the Drug Facts
Figure 3. Sequence of tasks and measures in the study.
8 Health Psychology Open 
Label," "Directions about when and how to take an over-the-
counter drug are near the end of the Drug Facts Label").
Other items focused on specific information included in all
nonprescription drug labels (e.g. "Over-the-counter drug
labels explain how a drug should be stored to maintain its
potency," "All over-the-counter drugs include specific cau-
tions for pregnant or breast-feeding women"). Scores on this
questionnaire ranged from 12 to 25, with a mean score of
19.26 (standard error of measurement (SEM)=0.18).
Truth ratings of claims about the drug facts for aspirin.Our
survey included 15 LSCs and 15 LRCs about the drug facts
to be found on a regular-strength aspirin label (see Tables 1
and 2 for the complete set of claims). LSCs were statements
that paraphrased specific drug facts on the aspirin label and
are clearly supported by the label text. For example, the
claim Students of high-school age or younger should not be
treated with aspirin for symptoms of chicken pox or the flu
is clearly supported by the label drug fact "Children and
teenagers who have or are recovering from chicken pox or
flu-like symptoms should not use this product." Figure 1
shows a portion of the facsimile aspirin label with seven
LSCs shown on the right next to their CSDFs. LSCs tar-
geted supporting drug facts from throughout the facsimile
label. Each targeted drug fact provides information essential
for the safe and effective use of aspirin as an analgesic.
In contrast, LRCs were statements that misrepresented
specific drug facts on the aspirin label and are clearly
refuted by the label text. For example, the claim Aspirin
should not be used to treat menstrual pain because of the
risk for increased bleeding is clearly refuted by the label
drug fact "Uses temporarily relieves ... menstrual pain."
Figure 2 shows seven LRCs shown on the left next to their
CRDFs. LRCs targeted refuting drug facts from throughout
the facsimile label. Each CRDF also provided information
essential for the safe and effective use of aspirin. In addi-
tion, the LRC targeting each refuting drug fact was written
to sound as plausible as possible. Our set of 15 LRCs there-
fore represented misconceptions about aspirin that were
discrepant from the label text.
Facsimile aspirin labels. We created a three-page, legal-sized
facsimile of the Principal Display Panel and the two Drug
Facts Panels for a brand name aspirin label. We used Arial
font sizes of 14 and 12, respectively, for the standardized
headings and text to provide a highly legible version of the
label format mandated by the FDA. The wording and the
use of bold face, italics, punctuation, and spacing corre-
sponded to that used on the actual aspirin label. One version
of this label used gray highlighting to focus participants'
attention on the 15 label drug facts that verified the 15 LSCs
(shown in part in Figure 1). A second version of the label
used gray highlighting to focus participants'attention on the
15 label drug facts that discredited the 15 LRCs (shown in
part in Figure 2).
Label-processing instructions.The cover sheet for each fac-
simile label instructed participants to attend carefully to the
Table 1. Means and their standard errors for pretest truth ratings (1=Not All True; 6=Certainly True) of label-supported claims.

words on the label sheets that were shaded in gray. Partici-
pants were told that they would have to read the instruc-
tions very carefully on their own. Once all participants had
read their instructions, they were asked to read them very
carefully a second time to be certain they understood what
information they needed to write down on the numbered
lines in the label facsimile. The two facsimile labels were
assigned randomly to participants in each session. Partici-
pants either read a label in which only CSDFs were shaded
(as illustrated in Figure 1) or a label in which only CRDFs
were shaded (as illustrated in Figure 2).
Participants randomly assigned to use the easily-con-
fused processing strategy read the following instructions:
On the next three pages, you will find a simulated version of
the actual Drug Facts shown on all aspirin labels. You will
notice that certain words and phrases on the label are shaded in
gray. These words and phrases highlight label information
often misunderstood by individuals using aspirin because they
seem wrong or confusing. Each shaded word or phrase
highlights an idea that consumers sometimes misunderstand.
We want you to see if you can figure out why this idea is often
misunderstood. For each shaded word or phrase, ask yourself,
"How could anyone be confused by this idea?" You will have
a short amount of time to write down your answer in a brief
sentence on one of the numbered lines at the bottom of each
sheet.

General verbal ability. After participants had read their aspi-
rin label as directed, they were asked to complete the
Extended Range Vocabulary Test (ERVT: Ekstrom etal.,
1976)--a convenient index of general verbal ability. The
6-minute, 24-item test is suitable for Grades 7­16 and cov-
ers a wide range of ability levels. Each item includes five
alternatives, and individuals are encouraged to guess if
they are able to eliminate at least one of the alternatives.
ERVT scores for our participants ranged from 0 to 16, with
a mean score of 8.93 (SEM=0.23). We asked participants
to complete the ERVT after they had read the facsimile
aspirin label in order to prevent them from rehearsing label
information prior to the aspirin claims posttest.
Cued recall test of claim-refuting drug facts. In all experimen-
tal conditions, recall of label information discrediting each
of the 15 LRCs was tested by presenting the shaded words
or phrases associated with those CRDFs (for example,
menstrual pain and changes in behavior in Figure 2). When
the experimenter read aloud the keyword phrase for a

participants were given 20seconds to write down the com-
plete drug fact before the experimenter read the next key-
word phrase. Two different random orderings of these cues
were alternated from session to session.
Procedure
Participants were tested in six- to eight-person group ses-
sions, removing the necessary forms from their materials
folders as directed by the experimenter. The experimenter
explained that the purpose of the study was to find out what
kinds of problems consumers might experience in reading
an OTC drug label for aspirin carefully enough to be able to
self-medicate safely and effectively.
Participants were then asked to complete the Drug Facts
Label Knowledge questionnaire. Next, they were asked to
use a 6-point Likert scale (1=Not At All True; 6=Certainly
True) to report their impressions of the validity of each of
30 aspirin claims. We told them some claims accurately
reflected information found on the product label for
regular-strength aspirin, while other claims contradicted
label information on the label. We told participants to rely
on first impressions in making their judgments. We empha-
sized that they should report their personal beliefs or feel-
ings rather than what they might have read or heard. We
also informed participants they would complete the ques-
tionnaire a second time after they had read our facsimile
aspirin label. They self-paced themselves through the
claims, taking about 3minutes to make their ratings.
After completing the aspirin claims pretest, participants
were told they would be reading a facsimile aspirin label
and answering questions about how consumers might
respond to the information on that label. They were told to
read the cover sheet instructions for their label very care-
fully to find out what kind of questions they would have to
answer about shaded items on the three-page facsimile.
After reviewing their instructions a second time, partici-
pants then had 10
minutes to read the label in its entirety,
taking 40
seconds to respond to each shaded item as they
read. The PDP page in the facsimile had only one shaded
text element and a single numbered line at the bottom of the
page. The experimenter allowed participants seconds to
read that page carefully and then write their easily-confused
or easily-ignored response on that line. The two Drug Facts
Panel pages that followed the PDP page each had seven
shaded text elements and seven numbered lines for partici-
pants' responses. In order to ensure that all participants
spent just 10
minutes reading and responding to the label,
the experimenter asked them to maintain a pace of 40sec-
onds for responding to each shaded item; 5-, 2-, and 1-min-
ute warnings were given to assist in maintaining that pace.
When participants finished the label-processing task, they
had 6
minutes to complete the 24-item ERVT. The experi-
menter explained that this vocabulary test assessed differ-
ences in verbal ability that might influence performance on
the label-processing task. The aspirin claims questionnaire
was re-administered immediately thereafter. To minimize
any confusion in rating the claims, the posttest ordering of
claims was the same as the pretest ordering. We anticipated
that participants might attempt to recall their initial ratings in
order to appear consistent or to recall facts from the simu-
lated label in order to appear informed. To ensure that they
focused instead on reporting their label-updated personal
beliefs, we strongly and specifically encouraged them to
report their current intuitions:
Don't try to recall to recall your previous ratings or anything
you may have read or heard about aspirin--instead just rate the
statements according to what you now believe. Read each
statement carefully, but then make a snap judgment about how
true it now seems to you.
The experimenter again allowed them 3
minutes to com-
plete the set of 30 claims.
Finally, the experimenter administered the cued recall
test by reading aloud the shaded words or phrases that sig-
naled those label drug facts that refuted each of the 15
label-refuted aspirin claims, allowing 20
seconds for each
response to be written. Participants were told only that the
recall test focused on information about aspirin that was
particularly important for its safe and effective use. Once
the cued recall task was completed, participants were given
a brief explanation of the purpose of the study and allowed
to ask any questions they wished.
Analysis
Unit of analysis.For greater clarity in presenting our find-
ings, we analyzed the data for LSCs and LRCs separately. In
order to ensure that any observed effects were neither partic-
ipant-dependent nor claim-dependent, we conducted paral-
lel analyses of participants and claims. In the individual
participant analyses, the participant was the unit of analysis,
and we collapsed across claims to obtain mean LSC and
LRC scores for each participant on the pretest and the post-
test. In this analysis, trials was a within-subjects factor;
Attentional Focus and Processing Strategy was between-
subjects factors. In the individual claim analysis, the LSC or
LRC was the unit of analysis, and we collapsed across par-
ticipants to obtain mean Attentional Focus, Processing
Strategy, and Trials scores for each of the 15 LSCs and each
of the 15 LRCs. In this analysis, Attentional Focus, Process-
ing Strategy, and Trials were within-claims factors.
Data transformations. We first demonstrated that participants
assigned randomly to the four experimental conditions did
not differ in their pre-label ratings of LSCs or LRCs. Because
they did not differ significantly, we subtracted pre-label
scores from post-label scores to obtain the updating index we
use in our main analyses. For LSCs, the index should be
Ryan et al. 11
positive because reading the label should increase the truth
ratings for those claims. For LRCs, the index should be nega-
tive because reading the label should decrease the truth rat-
ings for those claims. The means reported for the
individual­participant analyses were all adjusted for the
covariate effects of Verbal Ability and Label Format Knowl-
edge scores. The means reported for the individual claim
analyses were unadjusted because the two between-subjects
covariates could not be used in those analyses. Recall counts
were analyzed using both the square-root-of-x transforma-
tion and the square-root-of-(x plus 1) transformation (How-
ell, 2007: 318­324; Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007: 86­89).
Because these transformations did not change the pattern or
significance of effects, untransformed counts were used in
the analysis of cued recall performance reported below.
Results
Overall, the 15 pre-label LSCs received substantially higher
truth ratings, M=4.58, SEM
=
0.04, than did the 15 pre-
label LRCs, M=3.38, SEM
=
0.04. We analyzed the pre-
label truth ratings as a function of claim category and
experimental condition to determine whether participants
in our four experimental groups differed initially in their
ratings of LSCs and LRCs. The effect of claim category
was highly significant, F(1, 191)=898.20, MSE=0.16,
p
=
0.000, partial eta-squared
=
0.83. However, that very
strong effect did not interact with either of the treatment
groups to which participants were subsequently assigned,
Fs
<
1.00. Although our participants already assigned
higher truth ratings to LSCs than to LRCs, our Attentional
Focus and Processing Strategy manipulations of the label-
reading process were intended to increase the initial LSC
truth ratings and to decrease the initial LRC truth ratings.
This analysis of the pretest ratings served two purposes.
First, it demonstrates that there is some validity to our par-
ticipants' preconceptions about aspirin and that we were
successful in creating plausible LRCs. Second, the absence
of pretest differences among the four treatment groups
allows us to simplify the analysis by subtracting pretest rat-
ings from posttest ratings to create change scores as our
index of label-induced changes in beliefs. Claim-supporting
effects are visible as positive values on a bar graph, and
claim-refuting effects are visible as negative values on the
same bar graph (see Figure 4).
Effect of label processing on changes in truth
ratings for label-supported aspirin claims
Individual-participant analysis. Pre-label truth ratings of LSCs
were subtracted from post-label ratings to obtain a measure
of the degree to which reading the aspirin label increased
truth ratings for claims explicitly confirmed on the aspirin
label--an index of CSDF Shading or CRDF Shading. These
change scores were entered into a two-factor between-sub-
jects analysis of covariance that included Processing Strat-
egy (Easily Ignored or Easily Confused) and Attentional
Focus (Claim-Relevant or Claim-Irrelevant) as fixed fac-
tors, with Label Format Knowledge and Verbal Ability
entered as covariates. Neither Label Format Knowledge,
F(1, 190)
<
1.00, nor Verbal Ability, F(1, 190)=2.53,
p
<
0.15, was a statistically significant covariate. The main
effectofAttentionalFocuswassignificant,F(1,190)=45.00,
MSE=0.26, p<0.001, partial eta-squared=0.19, but Pro-
cessing Strategy, F(1, 190)=1.55, p
<
0.20, and its interac-
tion, F(1, 190)
<
1.00, were not. Covariate-adjusted truth
ratings for LSCs increased significantly more when claim-
relevant label text was shaded (M=+0.76, SEM=0.05) than
when it was not (M=+0.27, SEM=0.05). The covariate-
adjusted change score means for all four participant-based
LSC effects are shown in Figure 4.
Individual-claim analysis. Pre-label truth ratings for each of the
15 LSCs were subtracted from their post-label ratings to
obtain confirmational updating scores. These change scores
were entered into a within-claims two-factor analysis of vari-
ance that included Processing Strategy (Easily-Ignored or
Easily-Confused) and Attentional Focus (CSDF Shading or
CRDF Shading) as factors. Because individual claim scores
were collapsed across individual participants, there is no
meaningful way to include either Label Format Knowledge
or Verbal Ability as covariates in this analysis. The main
effect of Attentional Focus was significant, F(1, 14)=21.06,
MSE=0.10, p<0.001, partial eta-squared=0.60, but neither
Processing Strategy, F(1, 14)=3.92, p<0.10, nor the interac-
tion, F(1, 14)<1.00, had a significant effect. Truth ratings for
LSCs increased significantly more when claim-relevant label
text was shaded (M=+0.76, SEM
=
0.12) than when it was
not (M=+0.28, SEM=0.07). The change score means for all
four claim-based LSC effects are also shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Attentional and processing effects on changes in
truth values for label-supported and label-refuted claims.

Ceiling effects. It is possible that processing strategy effects
were not detected for truth ratings of LSCs because
increases in posttest truth ratings for those claims are lim-
ited by ceiling effects. The distributions of pretest ratings
for all 15 LSCs are negatively skewed toward the scale
maximum of 6.00, indicating that posttest increases for
those claims may be underestimated by our rating scale. We
evaluated this possibility by examining the correlation
between the sizes of overall pretest ratings for each of the
LSCs with the overall sizes of posttest increases for those
claims. LSCs receiving lower pretest ratings should be less
subject to ceiling effects and larger, while LSCs receiving
higher pretest ratings should be more subject to ceiling
effects and smaller. Therefore, a significant negative cor-
relation between pretest ratings and posttest increases for
LSCs would reflect the presence of ceiling effects. Spear-
man's rho values for easily-confused processing were sig-
nificantly negative whether the supporting label drug facts
were shaded on the label or not, rs
=-0.72, p<0.05 and
rs
=-0.63, p
<
0.05, respectively. Rho values for easily
ignored processing were also significantly negative whether
the supporting drug facts were shaded or not, rs
=-0.84,
p<0.01 and rs
=-0.56, p<0.05. These results suggest that
the absence of processing strategy effects in the claim-by-
claim analysis of LSC truth ratings may be due to artifac-
tual ceiling effects.
Reversals of initial judgments of label-supported claims. It is to
be expected that an effective refutational label will reverse
initial "false" judgments of LSCs but not reverse initial
"true" judgments of LSCs. Truth ratings of LSCs were
dichotomized into "true" judgments of 4, 5, or 6 and "false"
judgments of 1, 2, or 3 to determine if reading the label
reverses initial judgments. If the label is effective in modi-
fying LSCs, then the probability that "false" judgments of
those claims change correctly to "true" judgments should
be high, and the probability that "true" judgments of LSCs
change incorrectly to "false" judgments should be low.
Only the claim-by-claim data have enough false-to-true and
true-to-false cases to permit a meaningful overall analysis
of such changes. The median false-to-true reversal rate is
75.6percent for the 15 LSCs, and the median true-to-false
reversal rate for those claims is 6.2
percent. There are too
many empty cells to permit a similar analysis within each
treatment condition or for individual participants. As far as
LSCs are concerned, these data demonstrate that a careful
reading of the label is 12 times more likely to correct a mis-
conception than it is to induce a misconception.
Effect of label processing on changes in truth
ratings for label-refuted aspirin claims
Individual-participant analysis.Pre-label truth ratings of
LRCs were subtracted from post-label ratings to obtain a
measure of the degree to which reading the aspirin label
decreased truth ratings for claims refuted by the label--an
index of refutational updating. These change scores were
entered into a two-factor analysis of covariance that
included Processing Strategy (Easily­Ignored or Easily
Confused) and Attentional Focus (CSDF Shading or
CRDF Shading) as between-subjects factors, with Label
Format Knowledge and Verbal Ability entered as covari-
ates. Neither Label Format Knowledge, F(1, 190)<1.00,
nor Verbal Ability was a significant covariate, Fs<1.00.
The main effect of Attentional Focus was significant, F(1,
190)=19.03, MSE=0.36, p<0.000, partial eta-
squared
=
0.09, but neither Processing Strategy, F(1,
190)<1.00, nor its interaction, F(1, 190)=2.13, p<0.15,
had a significant effect. Covariate-adjusted truth ratings
for LRCs decreased significantly more when the claim-
relevant label text had been shaded (M=-0.15,
SEM=0.06) than when it had not (M=+0.23, SEM=0.06).
The adjusted change score means for all four LRC effects
are displayed in Figure 4.
Individual-claim analysis. Pre-label truth ratings for each of
the 15 LRCs were subtracted from their post-label ratings
to obtain refutational updating scores. These change
scores were entered into a two-factor analysis of covari-
ance that included Processing Strategy (Easily Ignored or
Easily Confused) and Attentional Focus (CSDF Shading
or CRDF Shading) as within-claims factors. The main
effect of Attentional Focus was significant, F(1,
14)=6.19,MSE=0.35,p=0.05,partialeta-squared=0.31,
but Processing Strategy was not, F(1, 14)=1.72, p<0.20.
Truth ratings for LRCs decreased significantly more
when claim-relevant label text was shaded (M=-0.15,
SEM=0.17) than when it was not (M=+0.23, SEM=0.06).
However, the Focus-by-Strategy interaction was signifi-
cant, F(1, 14)=8.02, MSE=0.03, p<0.05, partial eta-
squared
=
0.36. Curiously, the interaction represents a
difference between the two processing strategies when
participants had been focusing on irrelevant label text
(that relating to claim-supporting drug facts rather than
claim-refuting drug facts). There is a significantly greater
decrease in truth ratings for Easily-Confused than for
Easily-Ignored processing in the claim-irrelevant label
condition, t(14)=2.74, SEMDiff
=0.07, p=0.016. The dif-
ference is not artifactual because it is comparable in size
to the nonsignificant interaction found in the individual
participants' analysis reported above. However, an effect
that involves processing strategy differences for the
focus-condition label on which CSDFs were not shaded
is not theoretically meaningful. Only the difference
between the two processing strategies in the claim-rele-
vant shading condition is crucial in this analysis. The dif-
ference in change-scores between the two processing
strategies in that condition is not significant, t (14)<1.00.
Change-score means for all four LRC effects are dis-
played in Figure 4.
Ryan et al. 13
"Basement" effects.It is possible that processing-strategy
effects were not detected for truth ratings of LRCs because
decreases in posttest truth ratings for those claims are lim-
ited by basement effects. The distributions of pretest ratings
for 8 of the 15 LRCs are positively skewed toward the scale
minimum of 1.00, indicating that posttest decreases for
those claims may be underestimated by our rating scale. We
evaluated this possibility by examining the correlation
between the sizes of overall pretest ratings for each of the
15 LRCs with the overall sizes of posttest decreases for
those claims. LRCs receiving higher pretest ratings should
be less subject to basement effects and larger, while claims
receiving lower pretest ratings should be more subject to
basement effects and smaller. Therefore, a significant nega-
tive correlation between pretest ratings and posttest
decreases for LRCs would reflect the presence of basement
effects. Spearman's rho values for easily-confused process-
ing were nonsignificant whether the refuting drug facts
were shaded on the label or not, rs
=-0.14, p>0.50 and
rs
=-0.02, p
>
0.50, respectively. Rho values for easily-
ignored processing were nonsignificant whether the refut-
ing drug facts were shaded or not, rs
=-0.02, p>0.50 and
rs
=+0.15, p
>
0.50. We conclude that the absence of pro-
cessing-strategy effects in the claim-by-claim analysis of
LRCs cannot be attributed to artifactual basement effects.
Reversals of initial judgments of label-refuted claims. It is to
be expected that an effective refutational label will reverse
initial "true" judgments of LRCs but not reverse initial
"false" judgments of LRCs. Truth ratings of LRCs were
dichotomized into "false" judgments of 1, 2, or 3 and
"true" judgments of 4, 5, or 6, as we did above for label-
supported claim ratings. If the label is effective in modify-
ing misconceptions about LRCs, then the probability that
"true" judgments of LRCs change correctly to "false"
judgments should be high and the probability that "false"
judgments of LRCs change incorrectly to "true" judg-
ments should be low. Again, only the claim-by-claim data
have enough true-to-false and false-to-true cases to permit
a meaningful overall analysis. The median true-to-false
reversal rate is 28.6percent, and the median false-to-true
reversal rate for the 15 LRCs is 34.9
percent. As far as
LRCs are concerned, a careful reading of the drug label is
about as likely to induce a misconception as it is to correct
a misconception.
The nonparametric Mann­Whitney U test (Mann and
Whitney, 1947; Reinhard et
al., 2000) indicates that the
median beneficial (false-to-true) reversal rate for LSCs is
significantly higher than the median beneficial (true-to-
false) reversal rate for LRCs, U=5, two-tailed, p<0.05.
That test also indicates that the median detrimental (true-to-
false) reversal rate for LSCs is significantly lower than the
median detrimental (false-to-true) reversal rate for LRCs,
U=7, two-tailed, p<0.05. There are too many empty cells
to allow us to use this test to evaluate our experimental
hypotheses, but these results do document how difficult it is
for individuals to make use of authoritative label informa-
tion to correct misconceptions they have about a drug.
Cued-recall of claim-refuting drug facts
We used gist scoring to code recall protocols for the label
drug facts that refuted each of the 15 LRCs. Drug fact recall
counted as correct only if a participant (a) unambiguously
reported the substance of the refuting drug fact and (b)
made no reference of any sort to the label-refuted claim.
For example, the claim-refuting drug fact "It is especially
important not to use aspirin during the last 3
months of
pregnancy ..." was cued with months of pregnancy in all
experimental conditions. Label-based responses such as
"last three months--do not take," "should not take aspirin
if you are 3months before delivery," or "do not take if you
are in 1st trimester" were counted as correct. Ambiguous
responses such as "do not take if pregnant for more than
3
months," "if you are pregnant, you shouldn't take aspi-
rin," or "3months of pregnancy, do not take" were counted
as incorrect. We also excluded from the recall count any
response that echoed one of the 15 LRCs. For the recall cue
months of pregnancy, the associated drug fact was "It is
especially important not to use aspirin during the first three
months of pregnancy." Therefore, we counted as incorrect
such responses as "first 3
months possible birth defects,"
"under 3
months, don't use," or "less than 3 could hurt
newborn."
Many of the drug facts are bulleted under headings
that describe the action to be taken under specified condi-
tions. Because "fever lasts more than 3
days" is a drug
fact that reflects a bulleted condition under the action
heading Stop use and ask a doctor if, participants had to
report both the bulleted condition and the action heading
for their response to be counted as correct. For example,
the three responses "Consult a doctor if a fever lasts
3days or more," "more than 3days, contact doctor imme-
diately stop," and "fever lasts for 3days, stop use & con-
tact doctor" were all counted as correct in our scoring
scheme. However, responses such as "fever lasts more
than 10days, consult doctor," "if fever lasts for more than
3days stop taking it," and "if fever doesn't go away stop
see a doctor" were not. In each of these latter three
responses, the condition or the action is either incorrectly
specified or unspecified.
The second and third authors independently coded each
of the 15 cued-recall responses for all 196 participants. The
recall form was separated from the rest of the participants'
materials so that the two coders were unaware of the exper-
imental condition associated with the responses they were
coding. Beforehand, both coders classified all recall
responses from 20 randomly chosen protocols. The first
author then resolved through discussion with them what
additional coding guidelines would resolve all coder
14 Health Psychology Open 
disagreements. For example, the response "consult a doctor
if a fever lasts 3
days or more" was counted as correct
because we reasoned that stopping the use of the drug was
implicit in deciding to consult a doctor and would often go
unsaid by participants. However, "if fever lasts for more
than 3day stop taking it" was not counted as correct because
we reasoned that seeing a doctor was not implicit in decid-
ing to stop using the drug. These supplemental guidelines
were included as notes in the Excel files that both coders
used to record their responses. Between-coder agreement
was assessed as the Pearson correlation between the two
recall counts obtained for each participant. Overall, that
value was r(194)=0.96, p<0.001; Pearson values ranged
from 0.95 to 0.97 for the four experimental conditions.
Untransformed counts of label-based recall were used in
the final individual -participant and individual-claim analy-
ses because no square-root transformation affected the out-
come of those analyses.
Individual-participant analysis.Verbal Ability was a significant
covariate in the between-subjects analysis of covariance of
cued-recall counts for label-refuting drug facts, F(1,
190)=4.38, p
<
0.05, but Label Format Knowledge was not,
F(1, 190)=1.94, p<0.20. Both Attentional Focus, F(1,
190)=79.24, MSE=6.86, p<0.0001, partial eta squared=0.29,
andProcessingStrategy,F(1,190)=5.24,MSE=6.86,p<0.05,
partial eta-squared
=
0.03, significantly affected cued recall
counts. The interaction of Focus and Strategy was not signifi-
cant, F-(1, 190)
<
1.00. Cued recall scores were significantly
higher when the shading focus was on claim-refuting drug
facts (M=8.16, SEM=0.27) than when the shading focus was
on label-supporting drug facts (M=4.81, SEM-=0.26). Cued
recall scores were also significantly higher with easily-con-
fused processing of CRDFs (M=6.91, SEM=0.27) than with
easily-ignored processing of CDFs (M=6.06, SEM-=0.26).
The covariate-adjusted cued recall totals for refutational drug
facts have a maximum count of 15 claims for each participant.
In the individual-claim analysis described below, the maxi-
mum count is 50 participants -for each claim. In order to make
the results of the two analyses comparable, the total counts for
both analyses are shown as percentages in Figure 5.
Individual-claim analysis.Verbal Ability and Label Format
Knowledge were not entered as covariates in this analysis
because they are between-subjects variables associated with
individual participants rather than individual drug facts. As
in the individual-participant analysis, both Attentional
Focus, F (1, 14)=40.45, MSE=51.64, p<0.001, partial eta-
squared
=
.74, and Processing Strategy, F (1, 14)=4.74,
MSE=20.30, p=0.047, partial eta-squared=0.25, were sig-
nificant. The interaction of Focus and Strategy was again
nonsignificant, F(1, 14)
=
1.26. CRDFs were more often
recalled when they had been shaded in the facsimile label
(M=27.27, SEM=2.25) than they were when CSDFs been
shaded (M=15.47, SEM
=
2.31). Refutational drug facts
were also recalled significantly more often with the easily-
confused processing of shaded CRDFs (M=22.63,
SEM
=
2.27) than with the easily-ignored processing of
shaded, CRDFs (M=20.10, SEM
=
2.04). As noted for the
individual-participant analysis above, the total counts for
the individual-claim analysis are shown as percentages in
Figure 5.
Discussion
Summary of findings
We found clear support for our activation hypothesis in the
claim-rating data. When we highlighted key words or
phrases in the label text to draw our participants' attention
to claim-supporting drug facts, truth ratings of label-sup-
ported claims increased significantly more than when we
did not. When we highlighted keywords or phrases in the
label text to draw our participants' attention to claim-refut-
ing drug facts, truth ratings of label-refuted claims
decreased significantly more than when we did not. With
claim-relevant highlighting, the increase in truth-ratings for
label-supported claims was about five times greater than
the decrease in truth ratings for label-refuted claims.
We found no support for our reconciliation hypothesis in
the claim-rating data. When participants used the easily-
confused processing strategy to evaluate highlighted drug
facts, truth ratings of LSCs did not increase significantly
more than when participants used the easily-ignored pro-
cessing strategy. Similarly, when participants used easily-
confused processing to evaluate highlighted drug facts,
truth ratings of LRCs did not decrease significantly more
than when participants used the easily-ignored processing
strategy.
We found support for both the activation hypothesis and
the reconciliation hypothesis in our cued-recall data. The
attentional-focus manipulation and the label-processing

manipulation had significant and independent effects on the
cued recall of claim-refuting drug facts. Cued-recall of
these CRDFs was significantly greater when they had been
shaded in the label text than when they had not. Cued-recall
of claim-refuting label text was also significantly greater
with easily-confused label processing than with easily-
ignored processing. The difference in cued-recall rates
attributable to attentional focus was more than three-and-a-
half times greater than that attributable to processing
strategy.
Interpretation of findings
Our data provide partial support for the co-activation
account of refutation text effects on misconceptions.
Focusing our participants' attention on drug facts that
refuted a false claim about aspirin clearly decreased our par-
ticipants' faith in such claims. However, a label-processing
strategy that involved a consideration of how consumers
might be confused by those drug facts produced no addi-
tional decrease in their faith in those false claims. One inter-
pretation of our claim-rating data is that our easily-confused
processing strategy simply failed to prompt the reconcilia-
tion of false aspirin claims with refuting drug facts on the
label. However, this interpretation fails to explain why refu-
tational easily-confused processing produced an increase in
the recall of refuting drug facts.
Prior to offering an interpretation of our findings, we
should note that prior efforts to use this paradigm to produce
refutation change have been only modestly effective, with
confirmatory updating values on our 6-point scale ranging
from 0.70 to 1.04 and corrective updating values ranging
from -0.11 to -0.39 (Ryan, 2011; Ryan and Costello-White,
2015). The updating scores in this study are +0.76 and
-0.27, respectively. Surprisingly, the shading manipulation
and the processing intervention in this study did not produce
substantially greater updating effects than those we had pre-
viously obtained by simply asking participants to read the
label carefully while checking for typographical errors.
Our interpretation of the findings in this study is that
refutational change does not involve replacing a naïve mis-
conception with a correct conception. Instead, we believe
that a naïve misconception remains in memory, but the
refuting information is stored as well and can be used to
override that intuitive belief with a more reasoned explana-
tion. With respect to Kahneman's (2003) distinction between
intuitive and logical modes of thought, we assume that the
truth-rating data in this study reflect intuitive reasoning,
while the cued-recall data reflect logical reasoning. From
this perspective, the reconciliation process involves a rea-
soned comparison of a LRC and the aspirin label's CRDF.
When the reconciliation process favors the label's authorita-
tive drug facts, what is added to memory is the reconciling
account and the CRDF, and what remains in memory is the
intuitive belief that underlies the LRC.
Tversky and Kahneman (1971) used just an account
such as the one we propose to explain why the intuitive
judgments of statistically sophisticated researchers were
inconsistent with formal statistical principles. More
recently, Masson etal. (2014) have shown that physics
experts are more likely than physics novices to activate
brain regions involved in inhibition when they evaluate
an electrical circuit displays that illustrate a common
misconception about electrical circuits. Masson et
al.
argue that the misconception lives on in the memory of
the experts but that experts suppress their intuitive belief
in favor of a logic-based scientific account. In our study,
participants were given instructions to rely on their "gut
feelings" when they rated aspirin claims, but they were
told to be as accurate and as clear as possible in respond-
ing to the recall prompts for CRDFs. We believe that the
recall of a refuting drug fact reflects the successful rec-
onciliation of an incorrect claim with label information.
However, the feeling-based misconception lives on in
memory to bias intuition-based responses on the claim-
rating task.
Limitations of the study
One limitation of our study is that our processing manipula-
tion may have been relatively weak. Participants using
either the "easily-confused" or the "easily-ignored" pro-
cessing strategy had only 40seconds to develop a response
to each of the 15 label drug facts they considered.
Participants were not forced to justify their responses nor to
rate their confidence in them. However, the significant
effect of processing strategy on cued recall indicates that
the manipulation was an effective one, but that it did not
affect truth ratings. As we have explained above, it may be
that misconceptions and their intuitive truth values endure
even after they have been supplanted by scientific
explanations.
A second limitation of this study is that our label-com-
prehension task lacks ecological validity. We designed
this study to create optimal conditions for correcting mis-
conceptions. We shaded keywords associated with
CRDFs, and we asked participants to spend 40
seconds
writing an explanation of how a reader might ignore or
misunderstand the refuting drug fact. Our finding that
truth ratings of invalid claims changed decreased very lit-
tle under these conditions suggests that more routine
label encounters (purchasing a drug or using the drug)
would be even less productive in refuting misconcep-
tions. The recall of specific drug facts should be compro-
mised as well. If a consumer is only casually attending to
label information when purchasing or using a drug, recall
for drug facts is likely to be close to that we found for
those drug facts that were not shaded on our facsimile
labels. In that condition, our participants only recalled
about one-third of the 15 unshaded drug facts. It would
16 Health Psychology Open 
be of interest to examine truth-rating and cued recall per-
formance for individuals who used a nonprescription
drug on a regular basis to treat a chronic condition. Those
adults taking daily 81-mg doses of aspirin as part of a
"heart-healthy" regimen would be an ideal consumer
population for such a study.
A final limitation is our choice of aspirin as a nonpre-
scription drug. We chose aspirin because we find that young
adults are much more likely to use ibuprofen or acetami-
nophen as their analgesic of choice. In principle, the amena-
bility of aspirin misconceptions to label-based correction
may be quite different from that of other nonprescription
analgesics. However, we have obtained similar results in an
unpublished study in which participants read ibuprofen or
acetaminophen labels to confirm or correct preconceptions
about those two sets of drug facts. Both drug labels give rise
to the same strong confirmational effects and weak refuta-
tional effects we observe for aspirin. Future research should
focus on other classes of nonprescription drugs such as anti-
histamines, antitussives, antidiarrheals, and acid reducers.
Implications
This study demonstrates the potential for the strategic
use of text shading and PDP warnings to improve the
comprehension of nonprescription drug labels. We
shaded 15 claim-refuting text elements in one of our fac-
simile labels and 15 claim-confirming text elements in
the other. Given that very few label elements are shaded
in current drug labels (Leat etal., 2014), much greater
use can be made of this tactic for calling consumers'
attention to drug facts that refute naïve misconceptions
about a drug product. However, research will first be
necessary to identify the drug-specific misconceptions
that would constitute "Primary Refutation Objectives."
Currently, the FDA helps drug manufacturers define and
refine the Primary Communication Objects for a nonpre-
scription drug label. However, it may be even more
important to consider whether a drug label is effective in
correcting stubborn misconceptions about the safe and
effective use of nonprescription drugs.
Further research will also be necessary to determine
which general warnings ought to be showcased on the bot-
tle-cap or the PDP of a nonprescription drug container. The
injunction to "Always Read the Label" or "See New
Warnings Information" may be contributing little to foster-
ing powerful label-processing strategies. We have shown
that the general injunction to "consider why you might be
confused by some of these drug facts" or to "consider why
you might ignore some of drug facts" can improve drug
facts recall. Other general injunctions may be more effec-
tive than either one of these label-processing strategies.
Improving the quality of general label-comprehension
strategies need not require the omission of singularly
important warnings. For example, the bottle-cap for
Tylenol® includes the vital information that the product
"Contains Acetaminophen" as well as the general injunc-
tion to "Always Read the Label."
This study makes it clear that calling consumers'
attention to critical label information and urging them to
be mindful of the potential for misunderstanding may
prove ineffective in refuting intuitive misconceptions
about aspirin. Future research should focus first on the
generality of this effect--across a range of analgesics, a
range of nonprescription drug classes, and a range of
consumer populations. Just as importantly, future
research must identify innovative ways to make it pos-
sible for nonprescription drug labels to serve as refuta-
tion texts. A nonprescription drug label fails to serve its
intended purpose if it confirms consumers' valid precon-
ceptions about the drug but does little to refute their
invalid preconceptions.
