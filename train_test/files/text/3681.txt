Introduction
Firms undertake innovation to create value for stakeholders.
Sustainable process-driven innovation transforms ideas into
vital intellectual property which leads to shareholder value
creation through increased revenues. Contemporary strategic
thinking posits that firms can gain competitive advantage by
increasing its research and development (R&D) and adver-
tising expenditures. R&D-based strategies attempt to gener-
ate knowledge assets which enable firms to develop either
superior products or more efficient production techniques.
Advertising seeks to differentiate the firm's product from
those of competitors. Many research studies have provided
evidence that advertising and R&D expenditures have large
positive and consistent influences on the market value of the
firm. These studies suggest that advertising and R&D have
statistically significant and quantitatively important impact
on profit rates which provide a measure of market perfor-
mance. Despite the postulated importance of these expendi-
tures, firms still consider these expenditures as discretionary.
During difficult times, firms often reduce discretionary
investment expenditures due to reduction in income. The dis-
cretionary investment policy of firms can be viewed as stra-
tegic in nature. The present study aims to analyze the
determinants of discretionary investment behavior of firms
in food sector. Indian food products industry is chosen for
this study due to its complexity and diversity. Food and food
products are the biggest consumption category in India, with
spending on food accounting for nearly 21% of India's gross
domestic product (GDP) and with a market size of US$181
billion.
Review of Literature
Studies of Drucker (1986), Jacobs (1991), and Porter (1992)
suggested that firms compromise on discretionary invest-
ments during difficult economic times. However, studies
such as Srinivasan, Gary, and Arvind (2005); Clark (2008);
Kamber (2002); and Graham and Kristina (2008) viewed that
there are advantages of increasing these activities when other
firms are compromising it. When other firms are reducing

Determinants of Discretionary
Investments: Evidence From Indian
Food Industry
K. S. Sujit1 and B. K. Rajesh1
Abstract
Theoretical and empirical studies have focused on discretionary investments such as research and development (R&D) and
advertisement as value-creating activities. This empirical research article examines the determinants of the discretionary
investment policy of food sector firms in India. The study aims to analyze the impact of financial policies and firm characteristics
on the discretionary investment strategy of the food industry firms. The article uses the partial least squares structural
equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to understand the drivers of discretionary investment policy of food sector firms. The study
finds that investment policy of firms is a major determinant of profitability of food sector firms. Higher investments in capital
expenditures and working capital result in higher profitability. Management efficiency significantly influences firm profitability.
The results suggest that riskier firms in food sector might focus on R&D investments as a strategy to generate more cash
flows. Size of firm is negatively related to R&D intensity. Smaller firms in food sector tend to invest more in R&D. The study
does not provide evidence to suggest that profitable firms invest more in R&D activities.

these activities, an emptiness is created in the market, which
provides opportunity to differentiate and gain market through
advertisement. Nishimura, Takanobu, and Kozo (2005)
pointed that firms which compromise on R&D often deviate
from their long-term growth path and would significantly
harm the company in long run.
Literature on R&D and advertisement decision has come
a long way since structure, conduct and performance (SCP)
approach was proposed by Mason (1939) and Bain (1951).
These studies suggested that differences in conduct with
respect to R&D and advertisement behavior can be linked to
structure of the industry. Highly concentrated industry
behaves differently compared with less concentrated indus-
try. The SCP approach initially focused on inter-industry dif-
ferences. The focus then shifted to intra-industry differences.
Studies like that of Wernerfelt (1984) and Barney (1991)
postulated that the differences in firm performance are due to
unique firm-specific factors or resources. These specific
resources are valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitut-
able. Marketing and innovations facilitate firms to develop
these specific resources for gaining competitive advantage in
long run.
During the 1960s, management theory and research began
to adopt a new orientation which represented a middle ground
by improving the generalizability of the former, while obtain-
ing richer characterizations than the latter (Valarie, Rajan, &
Carl, 1988). The contingency approach in strategy literature
advocates that different strategies are contingent on competi-
tive settings of businesses. Competitive settings are defined
in terms of environmental and organizational contingencies.
These contingencies interact with firm-level factors, which
ultimately affects the strategies firms choose.
George and Agnes Cheng (1992) found that the differences
in strategies are due to type of offering and market type.
Studies of Schumpeter (1961), Arvanitis (1997), and Cohen,
Levin, and Mowery (1987) found that the size of the firm is an
important variable that determines R&D decision. Lee and
Sung (2005) found that the relationship between R&D and
size is probably stronger for industries with greater techno-
logical opportunities. Studies by Guariglia (2008) and
Hovakimian (2009) suggested that relationship between R&D
and size is positive for firms with higher capital intensity.
Ryan and Wiggins (2002) pointed that firms with high
growth opportunities have more incentives to invest in R&D
once a considerable percentage of their value is sourced from
assets which are not in place. Del and Papagni (2003) on the
basis of summarized studies of 20 years suggested that the
relationship between growth of the firm and research inten-
sity could not be established by many studies. The free cash
flow hypothesis advanced by Jensen (1986) stated that man-
agers endowed with free cash flow will invest it in negative
net present value (NPV) projects rather than pay it out to the
shareholders. Henry and John (2000) suggested that expected
returns and cash flows are important explanatory variables of
R&D intensities.
Generally Indian firms prefer technology purchase route
by paying royalty. This helps the firms to reduce uncertainty
surrounding R&D investments. Katrak (1989) found that
imported technology helped in promoting R&D activities in
Indian firms. Siddharthan (1992) found the relationship
between imports and R&D to be complementary. However,
R&D intensive firms often see outsourcing as an impedi-
ment, especially during 1990s. Michael (2005) found that
post nineties, R&D intensive industries have increasingly
entering into partnership relationship with outside suppliers.
Myers (1977) suggested that financial leverage often influ-
ence firm's strategies through agency problem with its share-
holders. Ho, Mira, and Chee (2006); Long and Ileen (1983);
Grullon and George (2006) found that financial leverage is
negatively related to both R&D and advertising spending.
Jensen and William (1976) and Raji, Gary, and Shrihari
(2011) suggested that higher level of debt in the capital struc-
ture moderates the effects of R&D and advertisement in influ-
encing the profitability during difficult times. Kotabe (1990)
confirmed that profits have a positive relationship with R&D
initiatives. Paunov (2012) found that small companies in
times of economic crisis faces difficulties in keeping their
level of R&D investment. As debt increases, the expected
costs of financial distress also increase. Cost of financial dis-
tress is called the underinvestment problem. Direct expenses
associated with administration of the bankruptcy costs appear
to be small. Indirect costs are huge, and the most important
indirect costs are likely to be reductions in firm value that
result from cutbacks in promising investment when compa-
nies get into financial difficulty. Managers may cut back or
postpone major capital projects, R&D, and advertising.
The study by Hirsch and Gschwandtner (2013) revealed
that the degree of profit persistence in the food industry is
lower compared with other manufacturing sectors due to
strong competition among food processors and high retailer
concentration. Furthermore, firm size is an important driver
of persistence, whereas firm age, risk, and R&D intensity
have a negative influence. The paper by Hirsch and Hartmann
(2014) used autoregressive models and Arellano­Bond
dynamic panel estimation to suggest that cooperatives which
account for around 20% of all firms in the European diary
processing sector are not primarily profit oriented. The panel
model reveals that short as well as long-run profit persistence
is influenced by firm and industry characteristics.
Theoretical Postulates
R&D has become a key strategic driver to improve the prod-
ucts and services in the modern world based on new technol-
ogy innovation. This article provides evidence on the
relationship between the financial policies of firms in the
food industry and R&D activities. The study explores
whether firms with significantly larger financial performance
have an intensive investment strategy in R&D.
Sujit and Rajesh 3
R&D investment strategy is long-term oriented and signi-
fies uncertainty. New products and services are very critical
for competitive success. It may be noted that managers are
risk averse and may avoid R&D investments for the follow-
ing reasons. Intangible investments have a greater probability
of failure than tangible investments. R&D being a long-term
growth investment involves technological and competitive
risks. The returns from intangible investments like R&D are
more remote in time compared with returns from tangible
investments. An important characteristic of R&D expenditure
is irreversibility in which if a firm decides to stop a R&D
project, it will not be able to recover all the money invested,
the reason being that these investments are partly specific to
the firm and cannot be sold at their acquisition costs. The
spillovers relating to processes of specific R&D will make it
possible for competitor firms to gain competitiveness at a
lower cost on account of the imitation of the processes.
In the context of risky nature of R&D investments, it can
be hypothesized that firms with greater financial perfor-
mance involve in active R&D investment strategy. Thus,
R&D investment strategy is a function of the financial per-
formance and other financial policies of the firm. It can be
stated that R&D investment strategy of food sector firms are
a function of profitability, size, liquidity, leverage, cash flow,
and other external characteristics.
Value drivers are crucial for value maximization. Value
drivers can be classified into operational, investment, and
financial. Firms with higher growth rate in sales, assets, and
profits tend to have higher profits. Higher investments in
form of capital investments and working capital result in
higher profitability. Improvement in management efficiency
or operational efficiency would lead to higher value for firms
in the form of increased profitability. Higher profitability
acts as an incentive for firms to undertake more intensive
discretionary investments like R&D activities. Higher profits
will lead to higher R&D intensity. R&D investment intensity
is also a function of the firm's size, liquidity, leverage, cash
flow, and risk characteristics. Large firms tend to make more
R&D investments. Firms with higher leverage tend to make
lower R&D investments. Firms with high liquidity and cash
flows tend to invest more in R&D activities.
The study assumes that the discretionary investment pol-
icy of food sector firms in the form of R&D expenses and
advertising expenses is a function of critical financial charac-
teristics of the firm such as size, growth, financial leverage,
risk characteristics, investment decision policy, asset utiliza-
tion efficiency, cash flow measures, and profitability. It is
assumed these financial characteristics determine the R&D
investment policy of food-based firms.
Data, Sample, and Method
The study collected required data from Prowess database
provided by Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE),
Mumbai. Prowess is the largest database of the financial
performance of Indian companies. The coverage includes
public, private, co-operative, and joint sector companies,
listed or otherwise. Total R&D expenditure is estimated by
adding R&D on capital account and R&D on current account.
The final data set was compiled in the following manner.
Those firms which reported zero sales figure were dropped
from the database. Firms with no R&D and advertisement
expenses were also dropped from the sample list. The final
sample consisted of 100 firms. The time period of study was
2008 to 2013. These firms by no means represent the whole
food industry but the availability of firm-level data restricted
the study to confine with the existing sample which remains
the limitation of the study.
Method
The present study tries to explore the determinants of R&D
intensity in food industry using a series of interdependent set
of construct. For this purpose, partial least squares structural
equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is considered as one of the
modeling technique which allows to visually examine the
relationship among variables. This would help the firms to
prioritize resources.
PLS method is a soft modeling technique mainly used for
predicting in social science. It is especially useful when the
factors are many and highly collinear. PLS path modeling
technique works well with less rigid distributional assump-
tions on the data. It allows researchers to simultaneously
verify a series of interrelated dependence relationships
between a set of constructs, represented by several variables
while accounting for measurement error (Rigdon, 1998).
This technique is an alternative to covariance-based SEM
(CB-SEM) for estimating theoretically established cause­
effect relationship models. This method uses variance to
develop theories in exploratory research by explaining vari-
ance in the target variables when examining the model. PLS-
SEM enables to identify most important antecedents of the
target construct. This method allows researchers to model
and to simultaneously estimate and test complex theories
with empirical data (Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2014).
For the present study, the objective is to verify all the possi-
ble variables which could explain the variations in the R&D
intensity in food industry in India.
In any structural equation model, there are two sub mod-
els, that is, the inner model and the outer model. The inner
model specifies the relationships between the independent
and dependent latent variables, whereas the outer model
specifies the relationships between the latent variables and
their observed indicators (Wong, 2013). The variables in
SEM are exogenous and endogenous which can be identified
with the direction of the arrows in the path diagram.
Exogenous variables are those variables which have arrows
pointing outward and none leading toward it. On the con-
trary, an endogenous variable has at least one path leading to
it and represents the effects of other variables.

Because PLS also reflects the sum of the diagonal in the
covariance matrix, it is also suited for prediction. Basically a
path model is a diagram that connects variables/constructs
based on theory and logic to visually display the hypothesis
that will be tested. PLS-SEM is more preferable than
CB-SEM in case of small samples and when the focus is on
prediction and theory development.
The systematic procedure for applying PLS-SEM involves
the following steps: (a) specification of the structural model,
(b) specification of the measurement models, (c) data collec-
tion and examination, (d) PLS path model estimation, (e)
reflective and formative model assessment, and (f) assess-
ment of the structural model.
The first step of estimation of PLS-SEM is to test for the
reflective measurement scale where the indicators are highly
correlated and interchangeable (Haenlein & Kaplan, 2004;
Hair etal., 2014; Petter, Straub, & Rai, 2007). The reliability
and validity of reflective latent indicators are examined using
their outer loadings, composite reliability, and average vari-
ance extracted (AVE) and its square root. If the construct is
of formative measurement scale, where indicators are not
interchangeable, then it can be avoided.
The final stage of evaluation of the structural model con-
sists of examining the coefficients of determination, predic-
tive relevance, and size and significance of path coefficients;
measurement of effect sizes by means of F2; and estimation
of Q2 to find the predictive relevance through blindfolding.
Model Specification
The PLS-SEM model proposed in the study assumes that dis-
cretionary investment intensity (DII) of food sector firms is a
function of financial policies and firm characteristics. The
financial policies examined are basically capital investment
decisions and working capital policies. Firm's financial per-
formance is also a major determinant of the investment
intensity of discretionary expenditures like R&D. Firm's
characteristics such as size, growth, risk, and leverage also
affect the R&D intensity. The variables selected for latent
construct DII were variables of R&D expenses and advertis-
ing expenses scaled by total assets, capital expenditures, and
cash flows. The variable reflecting intangible asset was also
included in the latent construct DII. The growth rates in
sales, assets, cash flow, and net income were included in
latent construct GROWTH. The latent construct RISK was
composed of variables such as variance of net income, sales,
and cash flow. The cash flow measures are scaled by total
assets and sales. The liquidity and leverage ratios are also
included in their respective latent constructs. The proxy for
investment measures were the variables of capital expendi-
ture and working capital which were scaled by sales. Proxy
for size measure was log of assets, sales, and net worth.
Return on equity, return on assets, profit after tax scaled by
total assets, net worth, and total income were the major vari-
ables included in the construct of profitability. The proposed
model for DII is framed with respect to latent constructs as
given in the diagrammatic design for the path diagram (see
Figure 1).
The values of latent construct DII are for the year 2013.
The other latent constructs have variables with average values
(2009-2012). The variable definitions are given in Table 1.
The year t represents year 2013, t-1 is year 2012, and t-4 is
year 2009. Descriptive statistics are presented in Appendix A.
Food Industry: A Snap Shot
India is the world's second largest producer of food. The food
processing industry is one of the largest industries in India
and is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption,
export, and expected growth. The total food production in
India is likely to double in the next 10 years with the country's
domestic food market estimated to reach US$258 billion by
2015 as per FRPT Research--Industry Updates, July 2014.
Agriculture, which provides employment to 52% of the popu-
lation, is estimated to account for 14% of the country's GDP.
Presently, the Indian food processing industry accounts for
32% of the country's total food market. Agricultural &
Processed food products Export Development Authority
(APEDA) and Marine Products Export Development
Authority (MPEDA) are the two agencies established by gov-
ernment of India for promotion of exports. The food industry
in India has been attracting a lot of attention from foreign
investors as the country is close to the markets of Middle
East, Africa, and South East Asia. The food manufacturing
industry is one of the United States's largest manufacturing
sectors, accounting for more than 10% of all manufacturing
shipments. In 2013, the U.S. food and beverage manufactur-
ing sector employed about 1.5 million people or just more
than 1% of all U.S. non-farm employment. More than 31,000
food and beverage manufacturing plants are located through-
out the country.
Expenditure on R&D is one of the most widely used mea-
sures of innovation inputs. R&D intensity is expressed as
R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP. Israel has the
highest R&D intensity, with gross domestic expenditure on
R&D (GERD) in excess of 4% of GDP.
R&D expenditure in the industrial sectors (both private
and public) constitutes 30.4% of the total R&D expenditure
of India. According to the Report of Research and
Development Statistics (2008), industrial R&D expenditure
was highest in the drug and pharmaceutical industry with a
share of 37.4% of total R&D expenditures as compared with
other industries.
In India, very few firms spend on R&D activities and its
intensity is very low. In food product manufacturing indus-
try, the 5-year average R&D intensity is 0.12. See Appendix
B for industry wise R&D intensity in India. About 167 firms
reported R&D expenses out of 1,150 firms. In terms of
amount spent, ITC Limited leads in the food industry with
848.67 million Indian rupees, but in terms of R&D intensity
Sujit and Rajesh 5
(R&D/sales), ITC ranks very low at 50. In terms of research
intensity, Green Earth Bio Tech leads in food industry with
34% followed by Venkateshwara Research & Breeding Farm
Pvt. Limited with 33%. In terms of R&D intensity, small
firms rank higher. See Tables 2 and 3, for example, though
food major ITC tops in R&D expenses, it occupies a low
ranking in terms of R&D intensity. This study provides
unique results in terms of anomaly.
Empirical Analysis
In PLS-SEM, the significance of factor loading is assessed
by the bootstrapping procedure with minimum samples of
5,000 and the number of cases equivalent to sample size (n =
50). Bootstrapping is a non-parametric procedure which can
be applied to test whether coefficients such as outer weights,
outer loadings, and path coefficients are significant by esti-
mating standard errors for the estimates. In the bootstrapping
process, the subsamples are created with observations ran-
domly drawn from the original data set (with replacement).
Through the process of bootstrapping, reflective and for-
mative indicators which were not significantly loading with
their respective loadings or not meeting the criteria were
removed from the model. For reflective indicators, outer
loading relevance testing is carried out based on the follow-
ing criteria. If outer loading is less than 0.4, the reflective
indicator is deleted. If the outer loading is less than 0.7 but
greater than 0.4, then the impact of indicator deletion on
AVE and the composite reliability are analyzed. If the dele-
tion increases the measures above the threshold, the reflec-
tive indicator is deleted. If the measures already meet the
threshold, then the reflective indicator is retained. The reflec-
tive indicators like NCFIA/SA (latent construct CASH
FLOW); OUTSOUR/SA (latent construct EXT); AG, NIG,
PBDITGR (latent construct GROWTH); DAR (latent con-
struct LEV); and DTR (latent construct OPEFFI) were elimi-
nated as their loadings were less than 0.4.
Validity Assessment of Reflective Measurement
Models
The PLS-SEM algorithm has converged. The assessment of the
reflective measurement model is done through indicator reli-
ability, internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, and

indicator variables. All reflective indicator variables are
statistically significant. There is only one retained reflec-
tive variable in the latent construct EXT. Hence, its outer
loadings are equal to 1. Similarly, there is only one forma-
tive indicator in the construct DII. DII refers to the mea-
sures of discretionary expenditures incurred by the sample
of firms in the food industry. In this study, the discretionary
expenses considered are the R&D measures. The initial for-
mative variables used included RD/PBDIT, RD/SA, and
RD/TA. In the final path construct, only the significant
variable of RD/TA was found to be relevant and retained.
Discretionary expenditures basically refer to advertising
and R&D expenses. In the initial model, we included mea-
sures of advertising variables such as Advertisement/Sales
and Advertisement/Total Assets. But the loading values
were very low and insignificant.
Analysis of Internal Consistency of Reflective
Indicators
The internal consistency reliability is analyzed through com-
posite reliability and Cronbach's alpha in Tables 5 and 6,
respectively.
Generally composite reliability values of greater than 0.6
are acceptable. The p values are statistically significant for
all the latent constructs measuring growth, investment deci-
sions, leverage, liquidity, operational efficiency, profitability,
risk, size, and external factors. The latent construct EXT and
GROWTH have reliability value of 1 as only one reflective
indicator is present in the latent construct.
A Cronbach's alpha measure of value 0.7 is considered
reliable. Majority of the constructs have Cronbach's alpha
value greater than 0.7. The Cronbach's alpha can be consid-
ered as the lower bound and the composite reliability as the
upper bound of the true internal consistency reliability.
Measurement of Convergent Validity
The AVE is the measure of convergent validity. AVE is the
grand mean of the squared loadings of all indicators associ-
ated with the construct. Each construct should account for at
least 50% of the assigned indicators variance. It is also
referred to as construct commonality. All the constructs sat-
isfy the convergent validity criterion as shown in Table 7.

Discriminant Validity
Discriminant validity is tested by means of assessment tests
such as Fornell­Larcker criterion, cross loadings criterion,
and the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT)
as presented in Tables 8, 9, and 10, respectively.
The Fornell­Larcker criterion suggests that the square
root of AVE must be greater than the correlation of the con-
struct with all other constructs including the formative mea-
sures in the structural model. The above criterion is satisfied
with respect to all the constructs.
10 SAGE Open
According to the cross loading criterion, each indicator
must load highest on the construct in which it is an indicator
measured both in terms of reflective and formative
measures.
HTMT Criterion
HTMT is the average heterotrait-heteromethod correlations
relative to the average monotrait-heteromethod correlations.
Monotrait-heteromethod correlations represent correlations
of indicators measuring the same construct. Heterotrait-
heteromethod correlations are correlations of indicators
across constructs measuring different phenomena. HTMT
values close to 1 indicate lack of discriminant validity. The
threshold value is considered close to 0.85. The constructs in
this study satisfy the discriminant validity assessment on the
basis of HTMT. The exception value is found for only con-
struct profitability versus investment decision.

Validity Assessment of Formative Measurement
Models
The validity assessment of formative measurement models
consists of assessing the collinearity issues and assessment of
significance and relevance of the formative indicators.
Collinearity issues occur when two or more indicators of a
construct are highly correlated. Collinearity assessment is
done through the analysis of Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs).
If there are no critical levels of collinearity (i.e., VIF < 5), then
the assessment of formative measures enters the next stage.
Table 11 reveals that all VIF values are less than 5. The
outer VIF values also satisfy the conditions of lack of
multi-collinearity.
The next stage involves assessing the relevance of the for-
mative indicators. The outer weight is assessed to be signifi-
cant or not. If the outer weight is significant, then the
operation is continued with the interpretation of the outer
weight's absolute and relative size. If the outer weight is not
significant, then the formative indicator's outer loading is
analyzed. If the outer loading is less than 0.5, then the sig-
nificance of the formative indicator's outer loading is tested.
If the outer loading is less than 0.5 and not significant, then
the formative indicator is deleted. If the outer loading is less
than 0.5 but is significant, then the removal of indicator may
be considered. If the outer loading is greater than 0.5, then
the indicator is retained even if it is not significant. Based on
all these selection criteria, the only formative indicator which
was included in the latent construct DII was RD/TA(research
and development expenses / total assets). All other formative
indicators representing advertising intensities and R&D
intensities were deleted due to non-relevance based on selec-
tion criteria as discussed above.
Assessment of the Structural Model
The assessment of the structural model consists of five steps.
In the first step, the structural model is assessed for collinear-
ity issues. The VIF values are found to be less than 5. Hence,
structurally the model does not have collinearity issues. The
second step involves assessing the significance and relevance
of the structural model relationships. The process involves
testing the significance and relevance of path coefficients.
The path coefficients vary between -1 and +1. The type of
effects is divided into direct effects, indirect effect, and total
effects. The third step involves examination of coefficient of
determination R2. R2 is a measure of the model's predictive
accuracy. The fourth step involves measurement of effect
sizes by means of F2. The last step involves estimation of Q2
to find the predictive relevance through blindfolding.
Path coefficient analysis explains the relevance and sig-
nificance of path coefficients. Higher absolute values denote
stronger predictive relationship between constructs. Direct
effect measures the relationship linking two constructs with
a single arrow between the two. Indirect effect measures the
sequence of relationship with at least one intervening con-
struct involved. The total effect is the sum of the direct effect
and all indirect effects linking the two constructs.
The constructs signifying cash flow measures, externality
(in terms of royalty measures), liquidity, and risk measures
are directly and positively related to DII. The constructs sig-
nifying leverage and size are negatively related to DII. The
relationship of risk and size with DII is statistically signifi-
cant as shown in Table 12.

The indicator variable values represent the average values
for the period t-1 to t-4. The indicator variables for DII were
for the period t. The path coefficient analysis reveals that
higher the cash flow generation by the food sector firms,
greater would be the R&D investments by the firm. But the
results are not statistically significant. The royalty payments
are directly related to R&D investments. This indicates that
Indian firms in food industry use R&D efforts to adapt,
assimilate, and develop imported technology. This result is
similar to the findings of Katrak (1989) and Narayanan
(1998). Firms with higher growth are more profitable. But
the results do not show statistical significance.
The path coefficient for construct investment decisions
(INVESTDECI) is 0.381 with statistical significance at all
levels of significance. Higher the investments of the firms in
terms of capital expenditures and working capital, higher is
the profitability of the firms. Hence, the investment policy of
the firms is a crucial determinant of the profitability of firms
in food sector in India.
Leverage is negatively related to R&D intensity with no
statistical significance. Higher the financial leverage of food
sector firms, lower will be the investments in R&D. Firms
with high leverage are considered to be riskier and hence
such firms may not be proactive in R&D investments. Firms
with higher liquidity positions would invest more in R&D.
The results are not statistically significant in this case.
Food industry firms which are able to manage their assets
efficiently are found to be more profitable. Higher the asset
turnover ratios or asset management efficiency, higher is the
profitability of firms. The path coefficient value of the origi-
nal sample was 0.659 with statistical significance at 1%
level.
The statistical significance of the relationship between
profitability and R&D intensity is not established. Profitable
firms may not focus much on R&D intensity.
The risk measures were analyzed through indicators rep-
resenting variance of cash flow measures. The results sug-
gest that riskier firms tend to invest much in R&D. It can be
interpreted that riskier firms in food sector might focus on
R&D investments as a strategy to generate more cash flows.
The path coefficient value was 0.142 with statistical signifi-
cance at 5% and 10% level.
Size is negatively related to R&D intensity. The path coef-
ficient value was -0.508 with statistical significance at all lev-
els. Smaller firms in food sector tend to invest more in R&D.
R2 is a measure of the model's predictive accuracy. It repre-
sents the amount of variance in the endogenous constructs
explained by all of the exogenous constructs linked to it. The
R2 value for DII is 0.379 (see Table 13). It can be stated that all
the exogenous variables used in the study accounts for 37.9%
of variation in the in the endogenous construct DII. Similarly,
about 70.5% of variation in profitability is explained by the
exogenous variables associated with the construct.
F2 measures the size effects. It assesses how strongly one
exogenous construct contributes to explaining a certain
endogenous construct in terms of R2. INVESTDECI to
PROFITABILITY and OPEFFI to PROFITABILITY have
strong effects (value greater than 0.35) and rest of the con-
structs have weak effects.
Blindfolding is an iterative procedure in which different
parts of data matrix are omitted. The estimates based on the
reduced data sets are used to predict the omitted parts. The
prediction error is used as an indicator of predictive rele-
vance. Q2 value of 0.058 for DII signifies weak effect and
0.286 for PROFITABILITY signifies moderate effect.

Interpretation of Results
The study aims to analyze the impact of financial policies and
firm characteristics on the discretionary investment strategy of
the food industry firms. Using the PLS-SEM model, the study
aims to understand the impact of financial policies on profit-
ability and, in turn, its effect on the R&D investment strategy.
Another focus of the article is to explore the impact of charac-
teristics like size, leverage, risk, royalty, and outsourcing capa-
bilities on the discretionary investment strategy of the firm.
The investment policy decisions of firms in this sector are a
major determinant of the profitability. The study finds that
higher investments in the form of capital expenditures and
working capital lead to higher profitability for firms in the
food industry sector. It can be interpreted that firms in food
industry sector would be able to enhance the profitability
through sound capital investment decisions (selecting projects
with positive NPV) and improving the working capital effi-
ciency. Efficient management of assets also increases the prof-
itability of the firms. However, the results could not establish
the relationship between profitability and discretionary invest-
ment characteristics of food sector firms. The results do not
show statistical significance to suggest that profitable firms
invest more in R&D activities. Higher the risk, greater is the
propensity to invest in R&D activities. Smaller firms tend to
invest more in R&D activities (see Appendix C).
Conclusion and Implications
This study explores the determinants of discretionary expenses
using PLS method. These determinants are considered as
latent factors which can directly or indirectly influence the
decision to invest in discretionary expenses. R&D and adver-
tisement intensities are taken as discretionary expenses. In the
initial analysis on account of low loading values which were
insignificant, the advertising variable indicators were deleted
from the discretionary investment construct.
Using PLS-SEM, the paths of these relationships are
explored. This method allows to include different variables
measuring latent factors. The result of the model shows that
investment decision and operational efficiency are impor-
tant factors which influence profitability. Manager's ability
to create value depends on the three major policy decisions
involving investments, financing, and working capital man-
agement. The results of the study indicate that firms which
invest in capital expenditure would create value for firms in
form of increased profitability. Efficient asset utilization
also emerges as a determinant of profitability of food sector
firms. However, profitability turned out to be not influenc-
ing discretionary expenses. Riskier firms tend to invest
more in discretionary expenses. It can be interpreted that
investments in R&D itself is a risk-taking initiative for
firms. Riskier firms in food sector might focus on R&D
investments as a strategy to generate more cash flows. It is
also interesting that size turned out to be negatively related
to discretionary expenses. This study allows the managers to
see the impacts of many variables representing latent factors
which directly or indirectly influence their decision to invest
on discretionary expenses. This allows the managers to pur-
sue appropriate strategies for determining discretionary
expenses.
