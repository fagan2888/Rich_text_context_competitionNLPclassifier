Objective: To examine the influence of state laws and district
policies on district-wide elementary school and middle school
practices related to physical education (PE) time and the
percentage of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
time during PE. Design: Multivariate, cross-sectional analysis of
state laws, district wellness and PE policies, and district PE
practices for school year 2010-2011 controlling for district-level
urbanicity, region, size, race/ethnicity of students, and
socioeconomic status and clustered on state. Setting: One
hundred ninety-five public school districts located in 42 states.
Participants: District-level PE coordinators for the included
districts who responded to an online survey. Main Outcome
Measure: Minutes and days of PE per week and percent time
spent in MVPA during PE time. Results: District PE coordinators
reported significantly less PE time than national standards--
82.9 and 189.6 minutes at the elementary school and middle
school levels, respectively. Physical education was provided an
average of 2.5 and 3.7 days per week, respectively; and the
percentage of MVPA time in PE was 64.4% and 65.7%,
respectively. At the elementary school level, districts in either
states with laws governing PE time or in a state and district with
a law/policy reported significantly more days of PE (0.63 and
0.67 additional days, respectively), and districts in states with PE
time laws reported 18 more minutes of PE per week. At the
middle school level, state laws were associated with 0.73 more
days of PE per week. Neither state laws nor district policies were
positively associated with percent MVPA time in PE.
Conclusions: State laws and district policies can influence
district-level PE practices--particularly those governing the

strengthen PE-related laws, policies, and practices.

Given that children spend approximately 30 to 35
hours per week in school for at least 9 months a year,
schools provide a unique opportunity to engage chil-
dren and youth in PA. Yet, given the emphasis on sub-
jects such as reading, writing, and arithmetic, many
school districts and schools do not prioritize PA and/or
physical education (PE) during the school day.4 While
the provision of PE is fairly commonplace, the duration,
frequency, and quality of PE varies tremendously.3,5,6
A recent consensus statement concluded that in-
creasing PE frequency and duration, increasing the
amount of MVPA time in PE, and providing trained
teachers to implement PE are keys to increasing
in-school PA.7
States laws and district policies govern PE in
schools.8,9 Most state laws have been on the books
for a number of years and have not changed substan-
tially since 2003.8 And, although not required, many
districts incorporated PE provisions into their con-
gressionally mandated school district wellness policy.9
(See the Supplemental Digital Content Table, available
at: http://links.lww.com/JPHMP/A23, that illustrates
the nationwide prevalence of state laws and district
policies governing PE time and MVPA time.)
Research on the relationship between state and/or
district PE laws and policies, respectively, is emerging.
Taber and colleagues10 illustrated that district policies
are stronger in states with strong PE laws, indicative of
top-down policy making.11 Yet, Eyler and colleagues12
documented the relative lack of evidence-based ele-
ments in state PE laws, with only 16% and 11% of
all such laws enacted between 2001 and 2007 contain-
ing language governing PE time or activity time, re-
spectively. Several studies have found a relationship
between specific PE time requirements and elemen-
tary school (ES) and/or middle school (MS) PE time
practices.13-15 Cawley and colleagues16 found that state
laws were associated with more student time in PE
and, in a California study, state PE mandates were as-
sociated with district-level compliance and student fit-
ness levels.17 Kim18 found no relationship between state
PE laws and school-level PE, children's PA, or obesity.
And, Evenson and colleagues19 found that a North Car-
olina statewide PE and recess policy change was asso-
ciated with increased PA participation, awareness of
healthy habits, student focus on studies, alertness and
enjoyment, and higher staff involvement. Although lit-
erature in this area is growing, we are unaware of any
study to examine the relationship between state laws,
district policies, and district-level PE practices. This
study seeks to fill this gap by illustrating the extent
to which state and/or district PE time and MVPA time
laws and policies, respectively, are being implemented
in practice in districts nationwide and to highlight pol-
icy opportunities.
 Methods
Data sources
State laws
State laws for each of the 50 states were compiled
by Bridging the Gap researchers at the University
of Illinois at Chicago.20 The state laws, effective as
of the beginning of September of school year 2010-
2011, were identified through key word searches of
the full-text, tables of contents, and indices of codi-
fied state statutory and administrative laws commer-
cially available from Westlaw (www.westlaw.com) and
Lexis-Nexis (www.lexis.com). Codified state statutory
laws include legislation, whereas codified administra-
tive laws include all rules/regulations promulgated
by state Boards of Education. "Informal," noncodified
policies adopted by state Boards of Education were ex-
cluded from this study. The codified state laws were
validated against secondary sources.8,21,22
District policies
The district sample was developed at the University of
Michigan's Institute for Survey Research, using sam-
pling frames based on the National Center for Edu-
cation Statistics' Common Core of Data files. Districts
from all contiguous US states were eligible.
"On-the-books" district policies effective as of the
beginning of the 2010-2011 school year were obtained
from 581 districts (98% policy collection rate9) in 47
states through Internet research with telephone and
electronic mail follow-up.9 District policies were de-
fined broadly to include: the district-approved wellness
policy, any associated district regulation, and any state
or district policies embedded by reference in the well-
ness policy/regulation (ie, PE policies). The University
of Illinois at Chicago's institutional review board de-
clared the district policy collection "not human subjects
research."
District sample and survey
District sample--Each district with a policy was contacted
to confirm the PE coordinator and to obtain the coor-
dinators' contact information. Physical education was
coordinated either at the district level (78%) or at the
school level (22%). Since this study sought to assess
district-level implementation of state laws and district
policies, the survey was restricted to the 444 districts
(located in 45 states) with district-level PE coordina-
tion. (The 2 other states included in the original dis-
trict sample did not have any sampled districts with
district-level PE coordination.) District PE coordinator
responsibilities ranged from PE curriculum coordina-
tors, to health/wellness specialists, to athletic/fitness
coordinators. Compared with excluded districts,

included districts were more high and less mid socioe-
conomic status (SES), less small and more medium-
sized, and more suburban and less rural.
District survey--An Internet survey of district PE prac-
tices, approved by the Washington University's institu-
tional review board, was conducted between February
and May 2011 with the district PE coordinators. This
analysis focused on the survey items related to PE fre-
quency and duration and percentage of PE time spent
doing MVPA at the ES and MS levels.
Third grade was the ES referent category, with
3 relevant questions asked. First, "On average, how
many days (range, 1-5) per week is PE required for
third-grade students?" Second, an open-ended nu-
meric question asked, "On average, how many minutes
per week of PE do students in third-grade receive"?
The third question asked, "What percentage of time
do third-grade students spend engaged in active PE,
that is, activity that will elevate their heart rates such
as running, jumping jacks, etc"? Ordinal response op-
tions ranged from 0% to 100%. All questions included
a "do not know" option.
Eighth grade was the MS referent category. Given the
variability in MS scheduling, options to assess block
scheduling were included to account for longer class
periods and fewer days per week associated with block
scheduling. PE coordinators were first asked, "What
type of scheduling is used for eighth-grade within the
district?" Response options were as follows: 1, block
scheduling only; 2, standard scheduling only; and 3,
both block and standard scheduling. "Block only" or
"both block and standard scheduling" respondents
were asked an open-ended numeric question: "On av-
erage, how long is each block of time allotted for PE?"
This question was followed by "On average, how many
blocks per week of PE do eighth-grade students re-
ceive?" Response options ranged from 1 to 5, with op-
tions for "every other day" and "it varies." Respon-
dents indicating that they used "standard scheduling
only" were asked an open-ended numeric question:
"How many days per week is PE required for eighth-
grade students?" Standard scheduling-only districts
were not asked the length of each PE session. Instead,
researchers at Washington University collected the in-
formation via Internet research with electronic mail and
telephone follow-up. A question on percent time in
MVPA, akin to the question asked for third grade, was
also asked for the eighth-grade level of applicability.
All questions included a "do not know" option.
The survey was pilot tested to determine completion
time and question wording. Washington University re-
searchers e-mailed the survey to each PE coordinator
through Qualtrics Online Survey Software (Qualtrics
Labs Inc, Provo, Utah) along with an introductory
e-mail explaining the survey purpose and offering an
opportunity to be entered into a raffle for a $25 gift card
for survey completion. Three follow-up electronic mail
messages were sent.
Analytic variables
Policy predictors (independent variables)
All state laws and district policies were double-coded
by 2 trained coders, using a reliable and valid ordinal
coding scheme.23 Coding agreement was high (ranging
from 94% to 97%), and discrepancies were resolved
through discussion among the coders and the lead
author. The original PE time policy coding schemes
ranged from a strong policy that met the National As-
sociation for Sport and Physical Education recommen-
dation of 150 minutes of PE per week (ES) and 225
minutes of PE per week (MS) (level 2 code),24 a lesser
requirement or only a suggested time standard (level
1 code), to no law/policy (level 0 code). The MVPA
laws/policies were coded as follows: 2, requirement
that at least 50% of PE time be spent in MVPA; 1, re-
quirement that less than 50% of PE time be spent in
MPVA or encouraged that PE time be spent in MVPA;
and 0, no MVPA-related law/policy.
Because of a limited number of survey-responding
districts being located in a state and/or district with
a strong (level 2) state law and/or district policy for
either topic, dichotomous variables (1, any law/policy;
0, no law/policy) were created for each item by grade
level of applicability. The state and district variables
were cross-tabulated to create a variable (one for each
grade level of applicability), with 4 mutually exclusive
and exhaustive categories to indicate policy jurisdic-
tion: none (neither district nor state); district only; state
only; or both district and state. Each of the latter cate-
gories was compared against "none" (referent).
District practices (outcome variables)
Elementary school items
Responses greater than zero for the third-grade minutes
per week were received from all but 19 districts requir-
ing PE. All but 13 districts responded to the question
regarding the number of days of third-grade PE. And,
147 districts responded to the active time in PE question
for third grade.
Middle school items
Response rates also varied for the MS items. Forty-six of
the 53 districts with block scheduling responded to the
number of blocks offered per week. For the standard
scheduling districts, data on the number of minutes
per session were obtained from 115 of the 130 standard

S44  Journal of Public Health Management and Practice
scheduling districts. Responses were received from 145
districts on the number of days of PE required per week
for eighth grade. Missing data for all ES and MS items
were replaced with the item mean.
To standardize responses across standard and block
scheduling districts, 2 new variables, "PE_TIMES"
and "PE_MINWEEK," were computed. PE_TIMES re-
flected the number of days per week that PE was of-
fered in eighth grade and was based on the number
of days of PE per week for standard schedule districts
and the number of blocks per week for block districts.
PE_MINWEEK was calculated by multiplying the min-
utes per session by the number of days per week for
standard scheduling districts and the minutes per block
times the number of blocks per week for block schedul-
ing districts.
District-level contextual controls--District-level characteris-
tics were obtained from National Center for Education
Statistics' 2009-2010 Common Core of Data (data for
school year 2010-2011 were not available at the time of
this analysis). For each district, data were obtained on
the total number of students (school size, collapsed into
tertiles based on the data distribution of small, medium,
and large [referent] districts based on student enroll-
ment); US census region (South [referent], West, Mid-
west, and Northeast); and locale (city [referent], suburb,
township, or rural). The percentage of students eligible
for free or reduced price lunch was used as a proxy
for SES, divided into 3 groups on the basis of free or
reduced price lunch distribution: higher SES (referent),
medium SES, or lower SES. School racial/ethnic com-
position was coded as 1 of 4 exhaustive and mutually
exclusive categories: majority white (referent); major-
ity Hispanic; majority black; and diverse (no majority).
(Table 1 provides the cutoffs for each of the categorical
variables.)
Analytic methods
Analyses were conducted using Stata/SE v.12.1.25 Be-
cause of the nonnormal distribution of the outcome
measures, Poisson regressions were used with robust
standard errors and state clustering to account for
the lack of heterogeneity in state laws for multiple
districts within each state. In addition, to ease in-
terpretation, predicted margins and marginal effects
were computed. The predicted margins equal the ad-
justed outcome (eg, days of PE per week) within
each policy category, controlling for covariates. The
marginal effects represent the average difference in
the outcome (eg, days of PE per week) associated
with the state and/or district policies as compared
with districts in states/districts without the given
law/policy.

Policy Influences on District PE Practices  S45
 Results
Completed surveys were received from 195 unique
districts (44% response rate) located in 42 states. Re-
spondent districts were not statistically different from
nonresponders on any characteristics. Table 1 presents
the responder characteristics. Physical education time
policies were more common at the state level, whereas
MVPA policies were more common at the district level.
Districts reported an average of 2.5 and 3.7 days of PE
per week at the ES and MS levels, respectively, and
an average of 82.9 (ES) and 189.6 minutes (MS) of PE
per week. And, districts reported a high percentage
of MVPA time--64.4 (ES) and 65.7 (MS) percent time.
Districts were distributed across regions and locales.
Districts were majority white, predominantly medium
or large in size, and more than 43% had low free or
reduced price lunch participation rates (high SES).
As indicated in Table 2, both state laws and district
policies were positively associated with more minutes
and days of PE per week. At the ES level, districts lo-
cated in states with a PE time law offered PE 0.63 more
days per week (2.78 vs 2.15 days) and districts in both
states and districts with PE time laws/policies offered
PE 0.67 more days per week than those with no such
laws/policies (2.82 vs 2.15 days). Similarly, districts in
states with PE time laws offered PE for 18.07 minutes
more per week than districts located in a state without
such a law (93 vs 74.93 minutes per week). At the MS
level, state PE time laws were significantly associated
with the number of days of PE offered per week--0.73
more days per week than districts located in a state
without such a law (4.18 vs 3.44 days per week).
State laws and district policies addressing MVPA
time were not positively associated with district reports
of MVPA time (Table 3); however, with 2 exceptions,

neither state laws nor district policies were statistically
related to such practices. The exceptions were that dis-
trict PE coordinators reported that 4.69% and 7.24% less
PE time was spent in MVPA at the ES and MS levels, re-
spectively, when the district had an MVPA policy than
districts where such a policy did not exist. State laws
were not significantly associated with district MVPA
time.
 Discussion
This study illustrated the extent to which public school
districts are implementing state and/or district PE time
and MVPA time laws and policies. Consistent with
prior research, this study illustrates that state laws, in
particular, have been influential in affecting district-
wide practices regarding PE time.17,19 District policies
were associated only with increased PE time when the
state also had such a law, indicative of top-down pol-
icy making,11 and not surprising given that district PE
policies are stronger in states with stronger PE laws.10
While the relationship between the state laws and
district policies with district PE practices is encourag-
ing, it is important to note that they all fell well be-
low the National Association for Sport and Physical
Education­recommended amount of PE time. Clearly,
more efforts are needed to find ways (from both a com-
peting demand and a resource standpoint) to enable
districts to offer more PE time.
Neither state laws nor district policies positively in-
fluenced the amount of MVPA time in PE. It is possible
that the district respondents overreported the amount
of MVPA time (64%) as compared with prior obser-
vational research that found that only 35% to 38% of
PE time was for MVPA26-29 and therefore one would
not be able to correctly interpret the outcome. In addi-
tion, as indicated in Supplemental Digital Content Ta-
ble (available at: http://links.lww.com/JPHMP/A23),
most states and districts do not address this issue in
their laws and policies and, when they do, districts are
more likely than states-only to address the issue, thus
policy opportunities exist to continue to enhance and
oversee implementation of laws in this area.9,12,30
As always, the findings are subject to several limita-
tions. First, this was a study of association and not cau-
sation. Second, the district practices were self-reported
by district PE coordinators and thus are subject to re-
porting error and/or bias based on the extent of the
respondents' knowledge regarding district-wide prac-
tices regarding PE time and MVPA time. While we at-
tempted to reach the district official most knowledge-
able about PE practices, respondent knowledge about
actual practices may be limited to what they believe
as opposed to what actually is happening in practice.
Third, we were unable to assess the relationship be-
tween laws and policies and school-level practices or
student time spent in PE or MVPA time in PE. Future
research would be well served to explore the relation-
ship between state laws, district policies, and student-
level PE time and MVPA time in PE. Finally, survey re-
sponders primarily represented larger, predominantly
white and high-SES districts nationwide; thus, the re-
sults may not be generalized to all districts nationwide.

Policy Influences on District PE Practices  S47
In conclusion, state laws and district policies have
the potential to influence PE time at the ES and MS lev-
els; however, state laws clearly seem to be driving dis-
trict PE time practices. Interestingly, although the laws
and policies in this area were not "strong" (ie, they did
not meet the National Association for Sport and Physi-
cal Education­recommended standards), the results of
this study indicated that even "weaker" policies with
lesser time standards are associated with increased PE
time. Given that most state laws and district policies
in this area do not change frequently9,10 and given that
states and districts are constantly navigating the com-
peting demands for time during the school day as well
as resource limitations, policy changes in this area will
be challenging, but the results of this study suggest that
PE time laws/policies can influence district PE time
practices. Given these challenges, districts would be
well served to engage in cross-sectoral collaborations
such as those recommended by the both the National
Physical Activity Plan31 and the Institute of Medicine32
with the education sector working with other groups
such as parks/recreation, transportation, health care,
etc, to facilitate increased PA time among school-aged
children.
