Excess Mortality Due to Pneumonia or Influenza
During Influenza Seasons Among Persons
With Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome
Joseph C. Lin, MD; Kristin L. Nichol, MD, MPH
Background: Anecdotal reports suggest that influ-
enza-related morbidity may be high among persons
with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),
but little information is available concerning the popu-
lation-level impact of influenza on mortality in persons
with AIDS.
Methods: Using the Multiple Cause-of-Death data files,
which contain information on all deaths occurring in the
United States each year, we calculated the numbers of
excess deaths and rates of excess death due to pneumo-
nia or influenza among persons with AIDS aged 13 years
and older during the influenza seasons 1991-1992 through
1993-1994. For comparison, numbers of excess deaths
and excess death rates were also calculated for several
other groups including the general US population aged
13 years and older and the general US population aged
65 years and older.
Results: During the 1991-1992, 1992-1993, and 1993-
1994 influenza seasons, there were 261, 254, and 191 ex-
cess deaths due to pneumonia or influenza in persons with
AIDS and excess death rates of 19.74, 15.38, and 10.17
deaths per 10000 persons, respectively, compared with
a summer baseline period. For the same seasons, we ob-
served excess death rates of 1.40, 1.62, and 1.48 for the
general US population aged 13 years and older and 8.10,
9.28, and 8.54 for the general US population aged 65 years
and older. Thus, persons with AIDS had excess death rates
substantially higher than the general US population and
similar to, if not somewhat higher than, the general US
population aged 65 years and older, a group that is al-
ready targeted for annual vaccination. The findings were
similar when we compared the preinfluenza season with
the influenza season.
Conclusions: Persons with AIDS have significant ex-
cess mortality due to pneumonia or influenza during in-
fluenza seasons and should be considered a high-risk
group that is targeted for the prevention of influenza.

INFLUENZA CAUSES significant
morbidity and mortality in vari-
ous high-risk groups, including
persons with chronic cardiopul-
monary disease, diabetes melli-
tus, and advanced age and those residing
in long-term care facilities. However,
there is limited information concerning
the impact of influenza on morbidity and
mortality in persons with human immu-
nodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS). Previous reports1,2 suggested
that influenza may severely compromise
respiratory function and cause pro-
longed duration of illness in patients
with HIV infection, but, until recently,
information regarding the impact of
influenza on this patient population has
been largely anecdotal.1-5 Because of
potential for substantial benefit, the
Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices since 1987 has recommended
that HIV-infected individuals receive
routine vaccination against influenza.6,7
However, this policy has been some-
what controversial,8 and its implemen-
tation in clinical settings has not been
widespread, as demonstrated by low
vaccination rates.9 Barriers to successful
vaccination efforts may include uncer-
tainties regarding immunogenicity of
the vaccine in patients with HIV infec-
tion10-15 and implications of possible
transient increases in HIV viral load fol-
lowing vaccination.13-21 Perhaps one of
the largest influences on the poor rates
of immunization has been the persistent
uncertainties concerning the magnitude
of risk posed by influenza among per-
sons with AIDS or HIV infection. For
this reason, we conducted this study to
assess influenza-related excess mortality
in persons with AIDS.

RESULTS
The characteristics of adults and adolescents who died of
AIDS during the study period are shown in Table 1. Of
the persons who died, 85% to 89% were male and more
than 90% were between 25 and 54 years of age. In about
15% of the persons, pneumonia or influenza was listed as
the underlying or one of the contributing causes of death.
The influenza seasons extended from November
through February for the 1991-1992 season, December
through April for the 1992-1993 season, and December
through February for the 1993-1994 season. Deaths due
to pneumonia or influenza among adults and adoles-
cents with AIDS followed a seasonal pattern, with peaks
generally occurring during the months of December and
January. This pattern paralleled the seasonal variability
seen for deaths due to pneumonia or influenza among
adults and adolescents in the general US population and
also followed the seasonal pattern for positive influenza
isolates in the United States (data not shown).
METHODS
DATA SOURCE
The Multiple Cause-of-Death data files22-23 are released an-
nually by the National Center for Health Statistics and con-
tain detailed information for each of the approximately 2.2
million deaths occurring every year in the 50 United States
and the District of Columbia. Information in the database
is derived from US certificates of death and includes de-
mographic variables, such as age, race, sex, and geo-
graphic area, as well as cause-of-death information. Cod-
ing of the underlying cause and contributing causes of death
for the data files is accomplished using rules established
by the World Health Organization that are applied to the
information obtained from the death certificates. This cod-
ing is increasingly automated, thus reducing or eliminat-
ing intercoder variation. Use of information regarding not
only the single underlying cause of death, but also the con-
tributing causes of death, can be particularly valuable in
achieving a more accurate portrayal of mortality. In some
cases, deaths are attributable to a number of concurrent dis-
ease processes for which a single underlying cause of death
insufficiently accounts for the interactions between chronic
or coexisting conditions and the immediate cause of death.
Previous publications22-27 have described the details, po-
tential uses, and limitations of the data files.
From the Multiple Cause-of-Death data file for 1991-
1994, we calculated the number of deaths due to pneumo-
nia or influenza each month for adolescents and adults (ie,
persons aged 13 years and older) with AIDS. Deaths were
classified as being due to pneumonia or influenza (ICD-
9-CM [International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revi-
sion, Clinical Modification]28 codes 480-487) if pneumonia
or influenza was listed either as an underlying or contrib-
uting cause of death in the file. Persons were classified as
having AIDS if the ICD-9-CM codes consistent with AIDS
surveillance case definitions also appeared in the data file
for each death. For 1991-1992, we used the 1987 case defi-
nition of AIDS29 (ICD-9-CM code 042 [AIDS] or codes 043
[AIDS-related complex] to 044 [other HIV disease], with
mention of 1 or more of the AIDS clinical indicator dis-
eases identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention [CDC]). For the 1992-1993 and 1993-1994 influ-
enza seasons and corresponding baseline periods, the 1993
expanded surveillance case definition of AIDS was used.
(For the 1993 case definition, the CDC added pulmonary
tuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia, and invasive cervical
cancer to the list of indicator clinical conditions.30)
For comparison, we tabulated the number of deaths
due to pneumonia or influenza (ICD-9-CM codes 480-
497) by month for all adults and adolescents in the gen-
eral US population. We also tabulated these data for 2 ad-
ditional comparison groups: the general US population 65
years and older (a high-risk group currently targeted for
annual influenza vaccination) and the general US popula-
tion aged 25 to 54 years (more than 90% of AIDS deaths
occur in this age group).
INFLUENZA SEASONS
Influenza seasons were defined using national influenza sur-
veillance data collected by the World Health Organization
collaborating laboratories in the United States.31-33 For each
month from October to May for the years included in this
study, we identified all months for which the total num-
ber of influenza isolates was 5% or more of the season's to-
tal influenza isolates. All these months constituted the in-
fluenza period for each study year.
BASELINE PERIODS
We used 2 baseline periods for establishing baseline pneu-
monia or influenza death rates. One, the preinfluenza base-
line period, was defined as the 2 months immediately pre-
ceding the influenza season for each study season. The other,
the summer baseline period, was defined as the June through
September immediately preceding each influenza season.
Because national influenza surveillance spans October
through May, data for the number of influenza isolates were
not available for the summer months. However, influenza
activity is assumed to be minimal during the summer.
CALCULATION OF EXCESS DEATHS
AND DEATH RATES
We calculated excess deaths attributable to pneumonia or
influenza during each influenza season by taking the differ-
ence between those deaths occurring each month in the in-
fluenzaseasonandthemonthlyaverageoftheprecedingbase-
line period. The total excess deaths for each influenza period
werecalculatedasthesumoftheexcessdeathsforeachmonth
during the influenza period. We calculated the excess deaths
rates per 10000 by dividing the total excess deaths for each
influenza season by the estimated number of living persons
according to population estimates derived from the 1990 US
census34 for the general population and from estimates from
the CDC35 for persons with AIDS aged 13 years or older in
the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. We as-
sumed that the distribution of deaths followed a binomial
distribution, and we calculated 95% confidence intervals for
the death rates, as recommended by the National Center for
Health Statistics.23

During the 1991-1992, 1992-1993, and 1993-1994
influenza seasons, there were 261, 254, and 191 excess
deaths attributable to pneumonia or influenza in per-
sons with AIDS, respectively, compared with the sum-
mer baseline period (Table 2). These excess deaths
corresponded to excess death rates of 19.74, 15.38, and
10.17 deaths per 10000 adults and adolescents with
AIDS. These excess death rates were 6.9 to 14.1 times
higher than the excess death rates due to pneumonia or
influenza observed among adults and adolescents in the
general US population and were even somewhat higher
than, although of similar magnitude to, those seen for
persons 65 years and older in the general US population
(Table 2).
During the same influenza seasons, there were 166,
242, and 176 excess deaths attributable to pneumonia
or influenza in persons with AIDS, compared with the
preinfluenza baseline periods (Table 2, Figure). These
excess deaths corresponded to excess death rates of 12.56,
14.65, and 9.37 deaths per 10000 adults and adoles-
cents with AIDS. These excess death rates were 8.5 to 10.3
times higher than the excess death rates due to pneumo-
nia or influenza observed in adults and adolescents in the
general US population. Similar to the comparison to the
summer baseline period, these rates were even some-
what higher than those seen for the general US popula-
tion 65 years and older (Table 2).
The general US population aged 25 to 54 years was
selected as an additional comparison group as more than
90% of AIDS deaths in our study occurred in this age
group. We found that the excess death rate from pneu-
monia or influenza was 81 to 155 times higher among
adults and adolescents with AIDS than for the general
US population aged 25 to 54 years compared with the
summer baseline period. Similarly, when using the pre-
influenza period as the baseline, we found that the ex-
cess death rate for adults and adolescents with AIDS was
106 to 161 times higher than that of the general US popu-
lation aged 25 to 54 years (Table 2).

substantial excess mortality due to pneumonia or influ-
enza during influenza seasons. The excess death rates from
influenza or pneumonia per 10000 persons are compa-
rable to if not greater than those for the general US popu-
lation 65 years and older, a high-risk group that is al-
ready targeted for routine annual influenza vaccination.
Previous studies have attempted to define the im-
pact of influenza or influenza-related illnesses on morbid-
ity and mortality in persons with HIV infection. In one case
report2 of a child with HIV infection and one case series1
describing 6 HIV-infected patients from whom influenza
virus was isolated, the authors suggested that patients with
HIVinfectionmayexperiencemoresevererespiratorycom-
plications and prolonged duration of illness. In one study36
that examined hospital use for patients with AIDS in the
state of New York, the authors noted that the length of hos-
pital stay was 2.8, 1.1, and 2.4 days longer in January (typi-
callywheninfluenza-relatedmorbidityandmortalitypeaks
nationwide) compared with June during 3 consecutive
years, but they made no comment concerning the fre-
quency of hospitalization, reasons for admission, or rates
of death. Recently, Neuzil et al37 demonstrated increased
hospitalization rates for cardiopulmonary causes during
influenza season in women with HIV infection. This ret-
rospective population-based cohort study of women en-
rolled in the Medicaid program for the state of Tennessee
demonstrated influenza-related excess morbidity in pa-
tients with HIV infection. Of all women with high-risk
chronic conditions, the risk attributable to influenza was
shown to be highest among those with HIV infection. This
study estimated the hospitalization rate for influenza-
related illnesses to be 300 per 10000 women with HIV in-
fection. According to their estimates, women with HIV in-
fection were 50 to 75 times more likely to be hospitalized
forinfluenza-relatedmorbiditycomparedwithwomenaged
15 to 64 years who were without high-risk chronic con-
ditions. Our study augments these findings by defining in-
fluenza-associated excess mortality for the entire US ado-
lescent and adult population with AIDS.
Other investigators have used several different types
of baseline periods to estimate excess outcome rates as-
sociated with influenza. These periods have included sum-
mer months,37-41 peri-influenza periods,37 and nonepi-
demicinfluenzaseasonswithlowratesofinfluenza activity
as defined by relatively flat curves for mortality due to

pneumonia and influenza.42,43 Because the choice of base-
line period can influence the calculated rates of excess
events, we adapted methods from several previous stud-
ies and used 2 different baseline periods in our study. As
expected, the use of 2 different baseline periods re-
sulted in somewhat differing point estimates for excess
mortality rates but identical conclusions regarding the
substantially increased risk among persons with AIDS
compared with the general US population.
We used both underlying and contributing causes of
death to estimate the total number of deaths due to pneu-
monia or influenza. According to Barker and Mullooly,44
up to one half or more of pneumonia-associated deaths
may be attributed to underlying chronic medical condi-
tions on death certificates. Consistent with these find-
ings, our estimated number of excess death due to pneu-
monia or influenza based on both underlying and
contributing causes of death are approximately twice those
obtained if only deaths with pneumonia or influenza as
the underlying cause were included (data not shown). The
resulting excess mortality rates of 1.1 to 1.6 deaths per
10000 that we calculated for adults and adolescents in the
generalUSpopulationaresimilartothosereportedbyother
investigators. For example, Kavet,45 in assessing the im-
pact of 3 influenza epidemics during the 1960s, esti-
mated mortality rates of 1.0 to 2.5 per 10000 persons in
the general population. He estimated that in 21% to 37%
of these deaths the underlying cause of death was pneu-
monia or influenza. Barker and Mullooly46 reported 1.2
excess deaths due to pneumonia or influenza per 10000

ganization in Portland, Ore, for the 1968-1969 and 1972-
1973 influenza epidemics. During the 1977-1978 influ-
enza epidemic in Houston, Tex, Glezen47 reported a
mortality rate due to acute respiratory disease among per-
sons aged 20 years and older of 2.26 per 10000.
The Multiple Cause-of-Death data files are derived
from death certificates. The use of these and other files
based on death certificate data is standard for tracking
national mortality trends,48 including influenza-
associated excess mortality.49,50 It is believed that more
than 99% of deaths occurring in the United States are reg-
istered.23 However, several limitations of death certifi-
cate data deserve comment and necessitate interpreting
our study results with some caution. Previous stud-
ies51,52 have suggested that 9% to 12% of death certifi-
cates fail to mention AIDS as the underlying or contrib-
uting cause of death among persons with known AIDS.
Therefore, it is possible that we underestimated the num-
ber of deaths occurring among persons with AIDS. This
possible underestimation may explain why our esti-
mates of the total number of deaths due to AIDS were
on average 11.5% lower than those estimated by the
CDC.35 Such an underestimation of deaths would most
likely have resulted in an underestimation of the excess
death rates due to pneumonia and influenza that we re-
ported. In addition, death certificates may not list pneu-
monia or influenza even when they were a cause of death.
In one study,44 16% of death certificates for persons who
died of pneumonia or influenza did not mention pneu-
monia or influenza. If it occurred, underreporting pneu-
monia and influenza on death certificates during the years
of this study would probably also have resulted in un-
derestimation of excess death rates. The presence of an
AIDS diagnosis, especially among persons with pulmo-
nary opportunistic infections, may also have contrib-
uted to a detection bias leading to more frequent listing
of pulmonary infections, such as bacterial pneumonias,
on the death certificate than might be seen in the gen-
eral population. However, if present, such a bias was prob-
ably most relevant in establishing the baseline rate of death
due to pneumonia or influenza. We found no evidence
of seasonal variability in the listing of pulmonary oppor-
tunistic infections as underlying or contributing causes
of death among persons with AIDS (data not shown).
Thus, our use of excess death rates above the baseline
rate likely minimized the impact of any detection bias.
Another limitation of the present study is that it en-
compasses years that predate the advent of highly active
antiretroviral therapy, which was not widely used to treat
persons with HIV infection in the United States until 1996.
Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral
therapy, morbidity and mortality from HIV disease and
various associated opportunistic infections have de-
creased significantly.53 Therefore, it is unclear whether
the magnitude of risk that we identified in this study will
be present in future years.
Our findings suggest that the magnitude of influenza-
related excess mortality in persons with AIDS is compa-
rable to, if not greater than, that seen among the general
US population aged 65 years and older, a high-risk group
targeted for annual influenza vaccination. Although vari-
ous reports13-21 have provided conflicting results of
whether influenza vaccination transiently increases HIV
viral load after immunization, the clinical relevance of
this short-lived phenomenon is unclear. To our knowl-
edge, no detriment in clinical outcome has ever been
shown to be associated with this transient viremia.
Questions also persist concerning the efficacy of vac-
cination in a patient population characterized by de-
fects in cellular and humoral immunity. However, until
recently assessments of vaccine efficacy10-15 have been
based on laboratory measurements of antibody re-
sponse, as opposed to clinical measurements of the pro-
tection that vaccination provides. One double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled trial54 in patients with AIDS and HIV
infection showed that influenza vaccination was associ-
ated with a 93% efficacy against laboratory-confirmed in-
fection and a 100% efficacy against symptomatic illness.
Even in the subgroups of participants with CD4 counts
less than 200/µL, 20% of those who received the vaccine
vs 50% of those who received placebo experienced res-
piratory symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, adults and adolescents with AIDS had sub-
stantial excess mortality due to pneumonia or influenza
during influenza seasons. The mortality risk attribut-
able to influenza in this population was comparable to
that of the general US population 65 years or older. In
the absence of any clear evidence to suggest that influ-
enza vaccination is clinically harmful to persons with HIV
infection and AIDS and in light of new information dem-
onstrating protective efficacy provided by vaccination,
our findings support recommendations for annual vac-
cination of persons with AIDS.
