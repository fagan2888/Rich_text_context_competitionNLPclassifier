Abstract
Background: Health-related quality of life measured with the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire
was one of the secondary outcomes in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute
ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN). We reported no statistically significant difference in EuroQol Group 5-
Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire score between the intervention and control groups, but deaths were not included.
Aims: Reanalyze the effect of intra-arterial treatment for large vessel occlusion in acute ischemic stroke patients on
health-related quality of life in more detail. We now include patients who died during follow-up.
Methods: The EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire questionnaires were obtained 90 days after
treatment. We used the Dutch tariff to derive a utility index from the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report
Questionnaire score. Treatment effect was estimated with the Mann­Whitney U test and linear regression. The
effect of treatment on the distribution of EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire dimension scores
was assessed with ordinal logistic regression.
Results: We obtained EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire scores from 457 (91.7%) of the 500
patients, including 108 who died before follow-up. Median EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire
score in the intervention group was 0.57, and 0.39 in the control group (p ¼ 0.03). Treatment effect estimated with
linear regression was 0.07 (95%CI: À0.001 to 0.143). Treatment specifically affected EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-
Report Questionnaire dimensions ``mobility'' (OR: 0.43, 95%CI: 0.29­0.66), ``self-care'' (OR: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.41­0.89),
and ``usual activities'' (OR: 0.53, 95%CI: 0.36­0.79).
Conclusion: Treatment had a limited effect on quality of life, as measured with the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-
Report Questionnaire. Nevertheless, patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by an intracranial occlusion in the
anterior circulation, who had intra-arterial treatment, experience better health-related quality of life than patients
without intra-arterial treatment.

Introduction
In MR CLEAN,a a multicenter randomized clinical
trial of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic
stroke, the health-related quality of life measured with
the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report
Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) at 90 days was one of the
secondary outcomes. The reported difference in the EQ-
5D-3L score between the intervention group (intra-
arterial treatment) and the control group was not sig-
nificant: adjusted difference 0.06 (95% CI À0.01 to
0.18).1 Patient who died before assessment of the EQ-
5D-3L were not included in the analyses. This was the
default statistical approach. However, in the EQ-5D
valuations of health states, which make use of the
TTO method, the state of death is given the anchor
value of 0. We felt that these valuations should be
included in order to reflect the total loss of quality of
life due to stroke.
The rather small and nonsignificant effect of treat-
ment on the EQ-5D-3L was remarkable since all clinical
(modified Rankin Score, NIH Stroke Scale, and Barthel
Index) and radiological outcome scores favored the
intervention.
Aims
The purpose of this study was to reanalyze the effect of
intra-arterial treatment for intracranial large vessel
occlusion in acute ischemic stroke patients on health-
related quality of life. In the present study we included
patients who died during follow-up. We estimated the
effect of IAT on the total score, the EQ-5D-3L, and the
score on its dimensions. Furthermore, we studied
the relation with other clinical outcome measures like
the modified Rankin Score, the NIH Stroke Scale, and
Barthel Index.
Methods
Study design
Patient eligibility and methods of the MR CLEAN trial
have been reported previously.1,2 In short, MR
CLEAN was a randomized clinical trial of IAT versus
no IAT along with best medical care in patients with a
proximal intracranial arterial occlusion in the anterior
circulation demonstrated on vessel imaging, treatable
within 6 h after symptom onset.
Outcome measures
EQ-5D-3L was scored at 90 days after inclusion. The
EQ-5D-3L consists of a descriptive system with five
dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/
discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension
has three levels: 1, no problems; 2, some problems; 3,
extreme problems. When three levels are included a
total of 243 (35) possible health states are defined.
The EQ-5D-3L score was converted into a utility
index through a country-specific value set (the Dutch
tariff).3,4 The Dutch tariff was established on the basis
of the time trade-off method. The values represent the
preferences of the Dutch population. Patients who died
before the follow-up interviews at 90 days received a
zero score on the EQ-5D-3L, an anchor score in the
valuation. Scores range from À0.33 to 1.00, with
higher values indicating a better quality of life. A
single experienced investigator, who was unaware of
the treatment assignments, interviewed the patient,
proxy, or health care provider by telephone to assess
the EQ-5D-3L.
Statistics
Difference in EQ-5D-3L utility scores between treat-
ment arms was compared with the Mann­Whitney U
test. Treatment effect on the EQ-5D-3L utility score
was estimated with the use of linear regression.1,2 The
effect of treatment on the EQ-5D-3L was adjusted for
age, NIH Stroke Scale at baseline, time from stroke
onset to randomization, previous stroke, atrial fibrilla-
tion, diabetes mellitus, and occlusion of the internal
carotid artery terminus.
We assessed the effect of treatment on the distribu-
tion of each of the dimension scores with ordinal logis-
tic regression. To validate the EQ-5D-3L assessment we
correlated (Spearman) it with the score on the modified
Rankin Score at 90 days, the NIH Stroke Scale at one
week, and the Barthel Index at 90 days. All analyses
were performed with Stata/SE statistical package, ver-
sion 14.1.
Results
Baseline characteristics
From 457 of the 500 patients (91.4%) included in the
trial, we obtained an EQ-5D-3L score. This included

108 patients who died before follow-up. In 43 patients
(8.6%), there was no opportunity to carry out the
EQ5D interview after assessment of the modified
Rankin Scale and the Barthel Index. Baseline charac-
teristics were evenly distributed by EQ-5D-3L availabil-
ity (Table 1).
EQ-5D-3L
The median EQ-5D-3L score in the intervention group
was 0.57, and in the control group 0.39 (p ¼ 0.03,
Mann­Whitney U test). In the intervention group 49
of 217 patients died (22.6%) and were given a zero
score on the EQ-5D-3L, compared to 59 of 240 patients
(24.6%) in the control group. Treatment effect esti-
mated with linear regression was 0.07 (beta coefficient,
95% CI À0.001 to 0.143). The adjusted value was 0.06
(beta coefficient, 95% CI À0.005 to 0.128). Treatment
effect was seen in the EQ-5D-3L dimensions ``mobility,''
``self-care,'' and ``usual activities.'' We observed no sig-
nificant treatment effect for the dimensions ``pain/
discomfort'' and ``anxiety/depression'' (Figure 1).
Validation
The correlation between the EQ-5D-3L score and the
modified Rankin Score at 90 days was strong
(rho ¼ 0.67, p < 0.01), and the same was true for the cor-
relation with the Barthel Index at 90 days (rho ¼ 0.45,
p < 0.01). The correlation with the NIH Stroke Scale at
one week was moderate (rho ¼ 0.30, p < 0.01).
Discussion
In this updated analysis of MR CLEAN, the effect of
intra-arterial treatment on the EQ-5D-3L score, which
now incorporated mortality, was significant with the
Mann­Whitney U test. Treatment effect estimated
with linear regression was smaller than the difference
between the median scores, because regression models
essentially compare means and the distribution of
scores was skewed and bimodal. Compared to the pre-
viously published results, the beta coefficient is
unchanged, but now with a smaller 95% confidence
interval. Our reanalyzed EQ-5D-3L scores are similar
to the results found in other RCTs of intra-arterial
treatment for acute ischemic stroke. REVASCAT
reported a treatment effect of 0.13 (95% CI 0.03­
0.23)5 and the ESCAPE trial of 9.4 (95% CI 3.5­
15.2).6 However, the ESCAPE trialists used the EQ-
5D visual-analog scale, which has a range of 0­100
and not the EQ-5D utility index. The SWIFT PRIME
and EXTEND-IA trials did not report the EQ-5D as a
secondary outcome.7,8

The effect of treatment on the EQ-5D-3L is relatively
small compared to the other clinical outcomes and we
found no treatment effect for two out of the five EQ-
5D-3L dimensions (``pain/discomfort'' and ``anxiety/
depression''). Particularly the dimension ``pain/discom-
fort'' is originally defined as ``pain or other com-
plaints.'' One could expect this dimension also covers
neurological deficits that interfere less with mobility or
self-care dimensions. However, our results indicate
otherwise. This raises the question if the EQ-5D-3L
reflects quality of life in the full range of limitations
relevant to stroke patients. However, we showed that
the EQ-5D-3L correlated well with other valid meas-
ures of functional outcome and slightly less with neuro-
logical deficits.
Our study has several limitations. First, the NIH
Stroke Scale was done 1 week after treatment allocation
and the EQ-5D-3L at 90 days. Second, there was no
formal blinding for treatment allocation of interviewer
and of course, patients could also be aware of the treat-
ment they had received. Third, ideally we want to com-
pare EQ-5D-3L scores for each patient before and after
stroke, but EQ-5D-3L scores before stroke were not
available. Last, in this study we only had three-month
results. Long-term results will be presented in CLOT
MR CLEAN (cost-effectiveness analyses and long-term
follow-up in MR CLEAN).9
In conclusion, we found that treatment had a limited
effect on quality of life, as measured with the EQ-5D-
3L. Nevertheless, we can conclude that patients with
acute ischemic stroke caused by an intracranial occlu-
sion in the anterior circulation, who had intra-arterial
treatment within 6 h after stroke onset, experience a
better health-related quality of life at three months
after onset than patients without intra-arterial
treatment.
