Background
Sociologists have theorized that group size and member par-
ticipation share a close link (Blau 1970; Caplow 1957;
Terrien 1959; Tsouderos 1955). Simmel (1902) noted this
connection more than a century ago. He argued that rela-
tively small groups are more effective at reinforcing commit-
ment and conformity. Small groups can use a wide array of
relational pressures because face-to-face interaction between
all members of the group is possible. As groups become
larger, the social ties between group members weaken and
commitment and conformity become more difficult to
enforce. The organization can no longer exercise the same
level of control over individuals. According to this theory, by
their very nature, large organizations create a less involved,
more heterogeneous membership. Applied to churches, Stark
and Finke (2000) argued that social network density declines
as congregations get larger, which in turns results in fewer
direct mechanisms for promoting commitment, and partici-
pation declines.
In spite of this strong theoretical link between size and
member participation, past research has failed to reveal clear
and consistent patterns. To date, a negative relationship
between size and attendance has not been established using
nationally representative data on American congregations.
Only a handful of studies collect individual self-reported fre-
quency of attendance and a measure of congregation size,
which is obtained from the respondent or the respondent's
congregation. These studies have often relied on small sam-
ples and/or samples of one religious subgroup, and they have
produced variable results. One study reported no difference
in the rates of attendance between individuals who attend
churches with fewer than 100 in attendance and more than
1,000 in attendance (Stark 2008:46­48). Using the US
Congregations and Life Survey (USCLS), another study
found that attendance was not significantly related to size
(Dougherty and Whitehead 2011). Using USCLS poses a
problem. While the survey is a nationally representative
sample of congregations, individual-level data are obtained
after a worship service and therefore underrepresent the
number of less-frequent attenders.

The Negative Relationship between Size
and the Probability of Weekly Attendance
in Churches in the United States
David Eagle1
Abstract
Are people less likely to attend large churches? Using nationally representative data, I find a negative relationship
between size and the probability of attendance for Conservative, Mainline, and black Protestants and for Catholics in
parishes larger than 500 attenders. The addition of control variables does not change these patterns. These results
support the theory that group cohesion lies at the heart of the size-participation relationship in churches. With the
rapid growth of megachurches in the United States, a negative relationship between size and frequency of attendance
could serve to accelerate aggregate declines in attendance. Methodologically, this article demonstrates how Bayesian
hierarchical models can handle complex data structures and imputation procedures in a unified model.

Several related studies use participation rate rather than
attendance rate to operationalize member involvement.
Participation rate is measured by a (usually) denomination-
ally collected report of each congregation's average weekend
worship attendance and total official membership. To obtain
the participation rate, the number of attenders is divided by
the total membership. The first article to use this approach
appeared in Administrative Science Quarterly in 1971. This
study of 157 Lutheran churches in South Dakota found a
modest negative relationship between size and participation
rate (Wilken 1971). A priori, the relationship was predicted
to be much stronger. The author speculated that other factors,
particularly the age composition of the congregation, moder-
ated the size-participation relationship. The second study
appeared nine years later in Social Forces and focused on 58
Protestant churches in Indianapolis. Here, the investigators
again found a negative relationship between size and partici-
pation (Hougland and Wood 1980). A study of 483 Nazarene
congregations found that the ratio of membership to atten-
dance was negatively correlated with size, which means that
larger churches have members who are less likely to attend
regularly (Pinto and Crow 1982). Two more recent congrega-
tional-level studies of Southern Baptist congregations
revealed a negative relationship between size and participa-
tion rate (Dougherty 2004; Finke 1994).
Studies that use participation rate bear some important
limitations. Church membership does not have the same sig-
nificance in all congregations and traditions. Some congre-
gations stress the importance of formal membership, while
others downplay its significance. In addition, some have a
large number of nominal members--members who rarely
attend but retain their memberships (students away at college
and shut-ins often fall into this category). Therefore, lower
levels of participation may simply reflect the fact that a par-
ticular congregation has a large nonresident, student, and/or
elderly population. By a similar logic, higher participation
rates may result if a congregation does not stress the impor-
tance of formal membership. Therefore, using membership
counts to calculate attendance rates provides an unreliable
estimate of the relationship between congregational size and
the propensity for individuals to attend regularly.
This research has contemporary significance given two
major, related trends in American religion: There is an
increasing concentration of people into very large churches
(Chaves 2006, 2011), and megachurches have rapidly prolif-
erated since the 1970s (Thumma and Travis 2007). Simmel's
(1902) theory suggests that much of the `action'between size
and attendance will occur in very large churches. Because
large churches are relatively rare and samples of churches
therefore contain few very large congregations, it is difficult
to test this relationship.
Other research examines whether size is related to the
degree of support an individual gives to and receives from
his or her congregation. While these studies are measuring
different outcomes, they bear mentioning because, according
to the theory, participation rates are intertwined with social
support. Again, these studies have produced mixed results.
For instance, one study found that size was negatively related
to an individual's perceived sense of social support (Ellison
et al. 2009); a similar finding was reported among Roman
Catholics, where satisfaction levels were higher among indi-
viduals in smaller parishes (Peyrot and Sweeney 2000). In
contrast, other research suggests that individuals who attend
churches with 1,000 or more attenders have more friends in
their congregation than those in small churches (Stark
2008:46­48). Another study suggested that congregational
size was not related to the likelihood of an individual's pro-
viding social support (McClure 2013).
To summarize, there is a strong theoretical link between
size and attendance, but the research that has examined this
relationship has significant limitations. Data quality issues
abound: Attendance rates are often derived from member-
ship counts, some studies only examine a single denomina-
tion, others reply on studies that overrepresent regular
attenders, and most studies contain few large churches,
which makes patterns hard to detect. The goal of this research
is to provide a clearer picture of the empirical relationship
between size and attendance using the best available data and
state-of-the-art modeling techniques. I will use multilevel,
nationally representative data that span multiple religious
traditions to measure both size and attendance at religious
services. I will also take advantage of advances in Bayesian
hierarchical linear modeling to estimate how this relation-
ship varies across groups.
Data and Methods
This research draws on combined data from the National
Congregations Study (NCS) and the General Social Survey
(GSS). The GSS is a representative sample of the noninstitution-
alized adult population in the United States. If a GSS respondent
indicates he or she attends religious services once a year or more,
the GSS asks for the name of the congregation, which then forms
a nationally representative sample of congregations (Chaves
2007; Chaves et al. 1999). The NCS was conducted in 1998,
2006, and 2012 and gathered a representative snapshot of con-
gregations in the United States by interviewing a key informant
from the congregation nominated in the GSS, most often the
senior pastor. The NCS was not conducted in 2000; however,
GSS asked respondents to report the size of the congregations
they attend. NCS response rates are 80, 78, and 73 percent for
1998, 2006, and 2012; GSS response rates are 76, 70, 71, and 71
percent for 1998, 2000, 2006, and 2012. Excluding congrega-
tions from non-Christian religious traditions, these data contain
1,608 cases from 1998, 1,319 cases from 2000, 1,684 cases from
2006, and 1,558 cases from 2012, for a total N of 6,169. The
NCS and GSS are linked, which allows the matching of indi-
viduals with their congregations'characteristics.
In this study, I conceptualize congregational characteris-
tics as individual-level data (so, for instance, we can think
Eagle 3
about a hypothetical respondent in this survey as a white,
married male who attends an urban congregation with 500
regular adult participants). Repeat nominations of the same
congregation occur. Of the congregations, 89 percent
received a single nomination, 8 percent received nomina-
tions from two GSS respondents, and 3 percent received
nominations from three to seven respondents. I treat dupli-
cate nominations as independent cases, which, because the
GSS employs a geographically clustered sampling proce-
dure, may not be completely valid, but the anticipated impact
of the study design is small.
Member participation is operationalized as a binary vari-
able that indicates respondents who report attending worship
services at their congregation "nearly weekly" or more.
Weekly worship service attendance is a standard measure in
the literature and is one of the few congregational participa-
tion variables available in the GSS. I tested specifying the
model with an ordinal outcome variable, which retains all the
categories of attendance, but the substance of the results did
not change.
The key independent variable in this analysis is the number
of regular adult participants in the congregation as reported in
the NCS by the key informant. Specifically, respondents are
asked to estimate the average number of attenders at all of the
congregation's regular worship services.
Table 1 summarizes the number of adults in the congrega-
tion that each GSS respondent attends, as assessed by key
informants. As these data show, congregation size is highly
skewed. The median respondent attends a congregation of
370 people, and the mean is 1,035. The size of congregation
that an individual attends has increased during the 14 years
of the NCS. In addition, 17 respondents reported attending
congregations with 10 or fewer regular adult participants. I
removed these cases from the analysis because they were
exerting excessive leverage on the regression results. The
NCS has good coverage of large congregations; 279 have
attendance between 2,000 and 4,999, 100 have attendance
between 5,000 and 9,999, and 16 have 10,000 or more
attenders.
There are a large number of cases wherein the key-infor-
mant report of congregational size is missing. Rather than
drop these cases, I use an imputation strategy, outlined below,
to retain these cases and increase the predictive power of the
model. Key informant reports of size were missing when the
congregation named by the GSS respondent may have cho-
sen not to complete the NCS, the NCS informant failed to
report the size of the congregation, or--the case in 2000--
the GSS respondent was asked for an estimate of the congre-
gation's size but there was no NCS conducted in that year. In
total, this procedure adds 2,310 cases, 185 from the 1998
GSS, 1,319 from 2000, 294 from 2006, and 144 from 2012.
the GSS does not ask the same size question as does the
NCS. The GSS asks, "About how many members does this
congregation have?" Past research has shown that this ques-
tion and the NCS "how many regular adult attenders" ques-
tion are strongly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of
.7 when both variables are logged. In this analysis, I consider
the key-informant report of size more accurate than the GSS
respondent's estimate. NCS respondents are generally senior
clergy with an intimate knowledge of the congregation. But in
cases where the NCS report of size is missing, the GSS con-
gregational-size variable is used to model likely values that
an NCS informant would have given if the response existed.
Controls
In this analysis, I introduce controls for factors that may
mediate the relationship between size and member partici-
pation. We know that women, married people, and those
with children attend services more frequently. Large
churches typically offer more programs for children and
families, something that may differentially attract women
(who are often the primary caregivers of children), married
couples, and those with children at home. Gender is a binary
variable coded 1 for female and 0 for male; a child present
in the home is coded as 1 with no children present coded 0.
Marital status is a categorical variable coded as never mar-
ried (reference), married, and divorced/separated/widowed.
Large churches are predominantly an urban phenomenon,
and rural location is coded as 1, with urban locations coded
as 0. Age is introduced as a continuous predictor (centered
at the grand mean) as younger people attend church less fre-
quently, but when they do attend, they favor larger churches
(Eagle 2012).
Some have suggested that more time-pressed individuals
may gravitate to larger churches because they offer greater
flexibility in terms of the degree of involvement (Chaves
2006; Eagle 2012). From other research we know that the
amount of discretionary time is negatively correlated with
higher education and higher income (Jacobs and Gerson
2004). Educational attainment is added as a categorical vari-
able coded as less than high school (reference category),
high school or GED, and bachelor's degree. Family income
is a continuous variable that is standardized, centered, and
expressed in constant 2006 dollars.
It is plausible that congregations with more per capita
resources are able to provide better programming and sup-
port, which leads to higher participation. It could also be true

that adding staff may compensate for lower participation lev-
els. To explore this relationship, I create a variable that mea-
sures the staff-to-adult-attender ratio. To construct this
variable, I add up the number of full-time and part-time staff
(with each part-time staff member counting for one half a
full-time staff member) and divide it by the number of regu-
lar adult attenders. I remove the cases where this ratio is
greater than or equal to .10 so as to limit the potential impact
of outliers. This variable is not available in 2000 because the
NCS was not conducted in that year. Missing values are
imputed.
Patterns of religious attendance vary considerably by reli-
gious tradition. Table 2 shows that weekly attendance is
highest among black and Conservative Protestants and much
lower among Roman Catholics and Mainline Protestants.
Churches are also structured differently. Roman Catholics
attend larger churches with smaller budgets and fewer staff
than their Protestant counterparts. Black Protestants, while
they attend churches with similar budgets as Conservative
Protestants, employ far fewer full-time staff per member.
Because size, staffing, and congregational resources affect
the kinds of programs and services a congregation offers, it
is likely that the size-attendance relationship will vary among
religious traditions. Rather than simply using indicator vari-
ables for religious tradition, I cluster respondents in religious
traditions and employ a hierarchical linear modeling
approach. A control variable approach cannot deal with het-
erogeneity between groups, whereas a hierarchical linear
modeling framework can.
Last, I add three dummy variables to indicate the survey
was done in 2000, 2006, or 2012 (1998 is the reference year).
In 2000, the NCS was not conducted, and estimates of size
are available only from the GSS. The strategy employed to
deal with this issue is outlined below. There are very few
missing data on all controls except for income and staff ratio.
The two cases with missing data on age and the single case
with missing data on marital status were dropped. With
income and staff ratio, a model-based imputation strategy
outlined by Tanner and Wong (2008) is employed to estimate
these values.
I run three models: one without controls included, one
with all the controls save staff ratio, and a third with all the
controls including staff ratio. I tested running a Bayesian
lasso model, where a shrinkage parameter reduces potential
colinearity between the predictors (Hans 2009). When run
this way, the model did not produce substantively different
results, so I run the models without a shrinkage correction.
Modeling Strategy
I use binary logistic regression to estimate the latent proba-
bility, p, that an individual attends worship services weekly
or more and test whether it covaries with the size of the con-
gregation attended, net of other covariates. Initial explor-
atory data analysis using nonparametric regression revealed
a possible nonlinearity in the relationship between size and
attendance. I add a squared size term to the model to accom-
modate this feature of these data. Other studies have revealed
a nonlinear relationship between size and organizational par-
ticipation for industrial organizations (Reiter, Zanutto, and
Hunter 2005). Because congregational size has such a wide
range, I take the natural logarithm of the size variable, log-
num, to compress the scale and improve the ability of the
model to estimate the regression coefficients. Lognum is
mean centered, which reduces the correlation between log-
num and lognum2 and leads to more reliable estimates of the
linear and nonlinear components of the effects (Bradley and
Srivastava 1979).
To deal with the difference between traditions but still
retain all of the cases in a single model, I use a hierarchical
linear model that clusters individuals within traditions. This
model contains group-specific intercepts for each religious
tradition and group-specific slopes on lognum and lognum2.
Because the control variables are either not of central impor-
tance or not likely to vary among traditions, they are added
as fixed effects, which also reduces the number of parame-
ters to be estimated. The data are modeled as follows:

The dependent variable Yi is an indicator variable that
equals 1 when the respondent attends services weekly or
more and zero otherwise. The vector p is the latent probabil-
ity that respondents attend weekly or more. The matrix W is
the set of k independent variables, and the vector k con-
tains the coefficients for each of these predictors. The vector
a[j]
contains the random effects of size for each jth
religious
tradition; the vector a1[j]
contains the random effects for size
squared. A and A1 are the average effects across all four tra-
ditions. V0 is the value of the intercept averaged over the
four religious traditions, and v is the vector of random effects
for each jth
religious tradition. All of the variables are stan-
dardized to place them on a similar scale and to reduce colin-
earity between the predictors.
The fact that these data contain missing values of the key
independent variable presents a challenge. However, when
this variable is missing, there is an estimate of size given by
the GSS respondent. To accommodate cases where the NCS
estimate is missing but the GSS estimate is available, I
employ a two-part modeling strategy. For cases where the
NCS size variable, lognum, is available, the basic hierarchi-
cal linear model is employed. When lognum is missing, I pre-
dict the value of the NCS variable from the GSS variable.
Predicted values of lognum are drawn from the following
predictive distribution:

are estimated from the following regression:

lognum and
GSS,h  
1 0 , (12)
h indexes all of the cases with nonmissing values of the NCS
variable.
All of the regression models are evaluated using a Bayesian
framework rather than a maximum likelihood­based approach.
For hierarchical models, Bayesian models are typically more
efficient at detecting small differences between group-level
coefficients. They also produce a full posterior, which makes
it much easier to produce confidence intervals around the
computed predicted probabilities. The Bayesian approach also
allows me to build in model-based imputation procedures for
missing values. The final model handles all the survey linking,
imputation, and calculation of predicted probabilities and
uncertainties in a single model.
In terms of prior choice for the Bayesian regression
model, I use a noninformative semiconjugate prior on the
intercept and all of the regression coefficients (normals with
mean = 0 and precision = 0.001). For the precisions (the
inverse of the squared standard deviation), I use diffuse
gamma priors with a = b = 0.001. The posterior distribution
is estimated using a Gibbs sampler, run with three chains for
50,000 iterations, with the first 25,000 iterations removed for
burn-in. Good mixing is observed in the chains, and there is
no evidence that the priors are informing the results in any
significant way. The posterior density of p contains the
uncertainty resulting from the procedures used to impute val-
ues of size and income.
The key goal of this analysis is to produce an estimate of
the probability than an individual will attend services weekly
in congregations of different sizes. To that end, I use the esti-
mated coefficients from equation 3 to estimate the predicted
probabilities that an individual will attend weekly or more
for congregations from 50 to 10,000 regular adult attenders.
The relationship is then plotted for each religious tradition.
From the posterior estimates of the coefficients, I report the
mean value of the parameter of interest and the 95 percent
credible interval. The credible interval indicates that 95 per-
cent of the population is contained within this range of val-
ues. In the regression tables, credible intervals that do not
contain zero are indicated in bold.
Results
Table 3 contains summary statistics of each of the variables
used in the analysis. Approximately one third of the respon-
dents are affiliated with either a Roman Catholic or a white
Conservative Protestant congregation, with 11 percent and 18
percent attending black Protestant or white Mainline
Protestant congregations. Attendance is highest for white
Conservative and black Protestants, with, respectively, 59
percent and 52 percent attending weekly, whereas for Roman
Catholics and white Mainline Protestants, 38 percent and 42
percent attend weekly, respectively. In keeping with the his-
toric disadvantages faced by African Americans, marriage
rates, income, and educational attainment are all lower among
black Protestants. White Mainline Protestants are older and
have higher incomes and levels of education than other reli-
gious groups (Keister 2011; Lehrer 2004; Lenski, 1961).
In Figure 1, I plot the predicted probability of attending
weekly against the natural logarithm of the number of adult
attenders in the congregation estimated from the full sample
and from samples restricted to each of the four major
Christian religious traditions in the United States: white
Conservative Protestant, white Mainline Protestant, black
Protestant, and Roman Catholic. The underlying regression
coefficients used to produce the plots are reported in Table 4.
6 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World 
Figure 1 reveals both important similarities and some varia-
tion in the relationship between size and the probability of
weekly attendance by religious tradition. Important to note,
the model does not credibly predict a positive relationship
between size and attendance for any of the groups.
For white Conservative Protestants, there is evidence of a
small negative relationship between size and the probability
of weekly attendance, but the relationship is not credibly dif-
ferent from zero. For white Mainline Protestants, the models
demonstrate a significant, negative relationship. The proba-
bility of attending a congregation of 50 is 0.40, attending a
congregation of 1,000 is 0.32, attending a congregation of
5,000 is 0.30, and attending a congregation of 10,000 is
0.25--a decline of 38 percent. The pattern is similar among
black Protestants. In a congregation of 50 attenders, the
probability of attendance is 0.52; in a congregation of 1,000,
the probability is 0.48; and in a congregation of 10,000, the
probability is 0.40, a total decline of 23 percent.
A different pattern emerges for Roman Catholics. There is
initially a positive relationship between size and attendance,
but then it becomes negative at around the 500-attender
mark. For Catholics, size is positively related to the probabil-
ity that an individual will attend weekly for congregations
with fewer than 500 participants, increasing 18 percent from
0.40 for those attending a congregation with 50 participants
to 0.47 with a congregation of 500 participants (where the
probability hits its maximum). From there, the relationship is
negative: For a congregation with 1,000 attenders the prob-
ability of weekly attendance is 0.44; for 5,000 attenders, the
probability is 0.40; and for 10,000 attenders, the probability
is 0.33, a total decline from the peak of 38 percent.
I then consider whether any key respondent or congrega-
tional characteristics are mediating this relationship between
the probability of weekly attendance and size.As shown both
in Table 4 and Figure 2, in all cases, adding the control vari-
ables does little to alter the observed relationship between
size and the probability of weekly attendance. In all models,
the coefficients on A and A1 (the group-level coefficients on
lognum and lognum2) remain significant and similar in
magnitude.

Discussion and Conclusions
In this study, I uncover a negative relationship between church
size and the probability of attending weekly. I found modest
differences in this association across traditions, but in all
cases, the relationship is negative. I also found little evidence
that this trend was mediated by the characteristics of the
respondent. The results show that there is a small negative
association between size and attendance for white
Conservative Protestants but that it is not statistically signifi-
cant. For white Mainline and black Protestants the models
demonstrate that a strong, negative relationship exists
between size and the probability of attendance. For Catholics
the model indicates a modest positive relationship initially,
which then turns negative for congregations with more than
500 participants. The addition of control variables does little
to change these patterns. Taken as a whole, these results fit
within the theoretical perspective that argues smaller groups
have an easier time promoting group cohesion and participa-
tion due to the greater density of social relationships con-
tained within smaller organizations. It is also likely true that
people who are less frequent attenders may gravitate to larger
congregations where they do not face the same pressures to
attend more frequently. Congregational resources--at least
insofar as the ratio of staff members to number of attenders
capture resources--do not mediate this relationship, which
suggests that more general organizational dynamics are driv-
ing this result.
Placed in the context of previous findings, what insights do
these results reveal? First of all, there is no evidence that large
churches either promote more frequent attendance or attract
more frequent attenders. The only models that indicate a cred-
ible, positive relationship is among Roman Catholic congrega-
tions with 50 to 500 attenders. It is possible that this positive
relationship is related to the fact that many small Catholic
churches do not have priests assigned to their congregations.A
larger congregation is more likely to have a full- or part-time
priest assigned to the parish, which may result in higher par-
ticipation. However, overall, the coefficient on staff-to-
attender ratio was negative, which speaks against this theory.
For all other cases, the models do not predict that size and
attendance have a positive relationship. Among Conservative
Protestants I do not observe a significant negative relationship
between size and the probability of attendance, which may
suggest that these types of congregations are able to overcome
the penalties associated with size. But overcoming the penalty
associated with size is not the same as reversing the trend. One
possible explanation is that Conservative Protestant congrega-
tions often heavily promote "small group" programs, where
members participate in more intimate study groups, which
may compensate for any penalities associated with size
(Dougherty and Whitehead 2011). I attempted to capture this
effect by adding the number of groups and the level of partici-
pation in these groups, but the controls did not alter the size-
attendance relationship. This could simply be because these
groups are extremely heterogeneous across congregations and

religious traditions, making any relationship difficult to detect
with the available data. It is also possible that White
Conservative Protestants overreport their attendance more
than other groups (Brenner 2011). This could also explain why
the negative relationship is not statistically significant.
Overreporting of weekly attendance results in more people's
reporting more frequent attendance, biasing the estimates
upward. Further research could explore whether evangelical
churches are bucking the trend or the weaker size-attendance
relationship is present due to overreporting.
It does not appear that congregational resources mediate
the size-attendance relationship. This is the motivation
behind model 3 in Table 3, where I added number of staff per
attender as a proxy for congregational resources. Staff mem-
bers are a key congregational resource. Most clergy spend a
significant proportion of their time promoting community
cohesion and creating opportunities for involvement.
However, adding this variable did not change the overall
relationship between size and attendance. In addition, the
coefficient on staff was significantly negative. This is consis-
tent with the possibility that congregations add staff to com-
pensate for decreased participation among the membership
or that congregations with more staff attract people who are
looking for a place where they can be less involved and see
staff as a signal that paid, as opposed to volunteer, workers
perform more of the core functions of the organization.

From this study, I cannot make definitive statements
about the underlying causes for these patterns I observed.
One likely pathway is that people who are less frequent
attenders of religious services attend larger churches where
they are more anonymous and do not face the social pres-
sures to attend more frequently or social sanctions if they
attend less frequently. Another possibility is that people who
attend large churches find fewer personal connections in
these environments and do not become as attached to the
organization as they would in other settings. It may also be
that in larger churches, because they offer a wider array of
small-group programs, people, given limited discretionary
time, might use small-group attendance as a substitute for
worship attendance. As already alluded to, neither the GSS
nor the NCS provides sufficient detail on group involvement
to test this theory. In addition, the other major multilevel sur-
vey on congregations and participants, the USCLS--while it
has more extensive information about congregational partici-
pation--is mostly made up of respondents who attend fre-
quently. It does not contain sufficient variation to make
strong claims about the impact of small groups on attendance
(Dougherty 2004). Also, as the analysis relies on cross-sec-
tional survey data, I cannot use these data to determine
whether small group involvement, in and of itself, is related
to an increase in attendance at services.
The fact that adding controls to the model did little to
mediate the relationship between size and weekly attendance
suggests that there is no significant relationship between any
of the control variables and the size-attendance relationship.
This finding is somewhat unexpected because previous
research has shown that size is related to socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES) (Eagle 2012) and SES is related to attendance
(Schwadel, McCarthy, and Nelsen 2009). However, given
these results, it appears that the size-attendance and SES-
attendance relationships are independent from one another.
This research represents a major advance over previous
studies because it combines information across the four
major Christian religious traditions in the United States.
Previous studies have focused on individual denominations
or religious traditions. The fact that I found that the rela-
tionship between size and attendance is relatively consis-
tent and negative across religious traditions raises questions
about studies that identify a positive relationship between
size and member participation. This research also allows
for a more coherent theoretical framework to be applied to
the connection between religious participation and congre-
gational size. The fact that organizational characteristics
vary considerably across religious groups, but the overall
relationship between size and attendance is negative, sug-
gests that more general organizational dynamics govern
this trend. Simmel's (1902) basic insights about the rela-
tionship between size and member participation continue to
provide a compelling conceptual framework to understand
these social dynamics.
