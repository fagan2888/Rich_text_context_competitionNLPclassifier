Background--Bilirubin, with recently recognized antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity, has emerged as a candidate
for atheroprotection. We hypothesized that higher levels of bilirubin would reduce susceptibility to peripheral arterial
disease (PAD).
Methods and Results--We analyzed 7075 adults with data available on the ankle brachial index, serum total bilirubin level,
and PAD risk factors in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999 to 2004), a nationally
representative cross-sectional examination of the United States population. A 0.1 mg/dL increase in bilirubin level was
associated with a 6% reduction in the odds of PAD (OR 0.94 [95% CI 0.90 to 0.98]) after adjustment for age, gender,
race/ethnicity, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic kidney disease, CRP, and
homocysteine. This result was not dependent on bilirubin levels above the reference range, liver disease, or alcohol
intake. The inverse association of bilirubin with PAD tended to be stronger among men (OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.96])
compared with women (OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.04]; Pinteraction
0.05), and was stronger among active smokers
(OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.73 to 0.90]) compared with nonsmokers (OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.02]; Pinteraction
0.01).
Conclusions--Increased serum total bilirubin level is associated with reduced PAD prevalence. This result is consistent
with the hypothesis that bilirubin is protective from PAD. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2008;28:166-172.)

Bilirubin, once considered simply the metabolic end
product of heme degradation, has emerged as a potential
endogenous inhibitor of atherosclerosis. Bilirubin is a potent
antioxidant under physiological conditions.1 It acts as an
antioxidant whether it is free or albumin bound,2 unconju-
gated or conjugated,3,4 and it inhibits both lipid and protein
oxidation.5 Bilirubin protects cells from a 10 000-fold excess
of oxidants through rapid regeneration of bilirubin by biliv-
erdin reductase.6 Additionally, bilirubin exerts antiinflamma-
tory effects on the vasculature.7,8 Oxidative stress and
inflammation are fundamental to the pathogenesis of athero-
sclerosis.9­11 The inverse association of serum total bilirubin
with coronary artery disease (CAD) suggests that the antiin-
flammatory and antioxidant properties of bilirubin might
offer protection from atherosclerosis.12
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an important manifes-
tation of atherosclerosis, associated with significant morbid-
ity including intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia,
and amputation, and portends a 2- to 6-fold increased cardio-
vascular mortality risk.13,14 Although risk factors such as
cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus are known to be
important risk factors for PAD, little is known about endog-
enous protective mechanisms that reduce the risk of PAD.
Given the remarkable antioxidant, cytoprotective, and an-
tiinflammatory properties of bilirubin, and the role of inflam-
mation, oxidative stress, and cellular injury in atherosclerosis,
we hypothesized that individuals with higher bilirubin level
would be less likely to develop PAD. We therefore examined
the association of bilirubin level with prevalent PAD in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to
2004, a nationally representative cross-sectional examination
of the United States civilian population.
Methods
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)
is a program designed to assess the health and nutritional status of
adults and children in the United States. The study was approved by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) institutional review
board and all subjects gave informed consent. The NHANES
detailed interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary,
and health-related questions. The examination component consists of
medical and dental examinations, physiological measurements, and
laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel.

Ankle Brachial Blood Pressure
Examination Protocol
Beginning in 1999, participants 40 years of age and older were asked
to participate in the ankle brachial index (ABI) examination. Those
who weighed over 400 pounds or had bilateral amputations were not
eligible. Participants lay supine during the examination. Systolic
pressure was measured on the right arm (brachial artery) and at both
ankles (posterior tibial arteries) using an 8-MHz Doppler probe. If
the right arm could not be used, the left arm was used. Each limb
pressure was measured twice in participants aged 40 to 59 years and
once in participants 60 years and older. The ankle brachial blood
pressure index (ABI) was automatically calculated (Parks Mini-
Laboratory IV, Model 3100) by dividing the systolic blood pressure
at the ankle by the brachial artery systolic blood pressure. PAD was
defined as either leg ABI being 0.90. If neither leg ABI was 0.90
and either leg ABI was 1.40, that subject was excluded from this
analysis because of noncompressible vessels.
Laboratory Methods
Serum total bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glucose were deter-
mined by automated biochemical profiling (Beckman Synchron
LX20); fractionation of total bilirubin was not performed. The LX20
uses a timed end point Diazo method to measure the total bilirubin
level. The analytical range for this assay is 0.1 to 30 mg/dL, and the
reference range is 0.2 to 1.3 mg/dL. C-reactive protein was quanti-
fied by latex-enhanced nephelometry. Total cholesterol and HDL
cholesterol were measured by automated enzymatic assay (Hitachi
704 Analyzer serviced by Roche Diagnostics). Total homocysteine
in plasma was measured by the Abbott Homocysteine assay.
Covariates
Self-reported race was defined as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Mexican-American, or other. A diagnosis of hypertension was
assigned if the subject reported a physician diagnosis of hyperten-
sion, if the subject reported taking prescription medications for
hypertension, or if the systolic blood pressure was 140 mm Hg or
the diastolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg. A diagnosis of
hypercholesterolemia was assigned if the subject reported a physi-
cian diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia, if the subject reported taking
prescription medications for hypercholesterolemia, or if the total
cholesterol level was 62.1 mmol/L (240 mg/dL). A diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus was assigned if the subject reported a physician
diagnosis of diabetes, if the subject reported taking prescription
medications (either insulin or oral agents) for diabetes, if nonfasting
plasma glucose was 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), or if fasting plasma
glucose was 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). Subjects were characterized
as active smokers if the subject answered yes to "do you now smoke
cigarettes", as former smokers if they were not active smokers and
they answered yes to "have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in
your life", or as never smokers if they denied smoking at least 100
cigarettes. Alcohol intake was categorized as 1 drink per day, 1 to
4 drinks per day, or 5 drinks per day. The presence of active liver
disease was determined by the subject's answer to the questions "Has
a doctor or other health professional ever told you that you have liver
disease?" and "Do you still have a liver condition?" We used the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation for
estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum creatinine
(GFR mL/min/1.73 m2)175(Scr)1.154(Age)0.203(0.742 if fe-
male)(1.210 if African American). Subjects whose estimated GFR
was 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were classified as having chronic kidney
disease.15,16 Further laboratory and examination details are available at
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/datalink.htm.
Derivation of the Sample
Of the 7571 subjects that had ABI data available, 113 were excluded
for noncompressible vessels. Of the remaining subjects, 7075 had
complete information on the main covariates of interest and therefore
constitute the sample used in this analysis. Of these subjects, 6924
had alcohol intake data available.
Statistical Analysis
NHANES uses a complex, multistage, probability-sampling design
to select participants representative of the civilian, noninstitutional-
ized U.S. population. All analyses accounted for the complex
sampling method. A 6-year mobile examination center (MEC)
weight variable was created by assigning 2/3 of the 4 year weight for
1999 to 2002 if the person was sampled in 1999 to 2002 or assigning
1/3 of the 2 year weight for 2003 to 2004 if the person was sampled
in 2003 to 2004.
Analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute
Inc) callable SUDAAN version 9.01 (Research Triangle Institute).
Hypothesis testing was 2-tailed, with a probability value of 0.05
considered significant. Subject characteristics are reported as the
weighted mean and standard error (SE) or the weighted percentile
and SE, unless indicated otherwise. Odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were estimated by logistic regression. Based on
recognized risk factors for lower extremity PAD and previous
analyses in the NHANES, age, gender (female versus male), race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican Amer-
ican, other), hypertension (yes versus no), diabetes mellitus (yes
versus no), hypercholesterolemia (yes versus no), chronic kidney
disease (yes versus no), smoking status (never, former, active),
homocysteine level (10 mol, 10 to 15 mol, 15 mol),17 and
CRP level (1 mg/L, 1 to 3 mg/L, 3 mg/L)18 were adjusted for in
the multivariable model.16,19
We examined the likelihood of PAD associated with a 0.1 mg/dL
increase and by a 1 standard deviation (0.28 mg/dL) increase in
bilirubin level. Based on observations regarding the relationship
between bilirubin level and coronary disease,20,21 a priori we
examined whether the relationship between bilirubin level and PAD
varied by gender in stratified analyses and by adding a
bilirubin*gender interaction term in the full multivariable model. We
also examined a priori whether smoking status influenced the
association of bilirubin level with PAD, as has been suggested
previously.22 For analyses examining the interaction of smoking
status with bilirubin level, subjects were characterized either as
nonsmokers or active smokers.
Results
Of the 7075 analyzed subjects, 599 subjects had an ABI
0.90. The weighted mean prevalence of PAD was 5.8%
(0.3). Subject characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The
mean serum total bilirubin was 0.70 (0.01) mg/dL, the median
was 0.70 (interquartile range 0.5 to 0.8) mg/dL, and the mode
was 0.60 mg/dL. The distribution of bilirubin levels can be
seen in the Figure.
Serum total bilirubin level was associated with multiple
subject characteristics (Table 2). Female gender, non-
Hispanic black race/ethnicity, active smoking status, and
higher CRP category were associated with lower bilirubin
levels, whereas higher homocysteine category was associated
with higher bilirubin levels.
PAD was also associated with multiple subject character-
istics (Table 1). Increasing age, non-Hispanic black race/
ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia,
smoking, chronic kidney disease, higher CRP level, and
higher homocysteine level were all associated with an in-
creased likelihood of PAD, in agreement with previous
analyses of the NHANES cohort.16,19
Association of Serum Total Bilirubin
Level With PAD
Subjects with PAD had a significantly lower mean total
bilirubin level than subjects without PAD (0.65 [95% CI 0.62
to 0.67] versus 0.71 [95% CI 0.69 to 0.72] mg/dL). PAD

prevalence was lower among subjects with higher bilirubin
levels (Ptrend
0.001; Figure). In unadjusted logistic regression
analysis, a 0.1 mg/dL increase in bilirubin was associated
with a 9% reduced odds of PAD (OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.88 to
0.95]): the standardized estimate was an OR of 0.77 (95% CI
0.69 to 0.86). In a multivariable model adjusting for age,
gender, race/ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholes-
terolemia, smoking status, chronic kidney disease, homocys-
teine, and CRP, a 0.1 mg/dL increase in total bilirubin was
associated with a 6% reduced odds of PAD (OR 0.94 [95%CI
0.90 to 0.98]): the standardized estimate was an OR of 0.83
(95% CI 0.73 to 0.95). Excluding the 3% of subjects with
bilirubin level greater than the upper-limit of the reference
range (1.3 mg/dL) did not change this result (OR 0.93 [95%
CI 0.88 to 0.99]). Additional adjustment for HDL cholesterol
also did not change the association of bilirubin with PAD (not
shown). Also, adjustment for total cholesterol:HDL choles-
terol ratio in place of hypercholesterolemia did not change the
results (OR 0.94 [95% CI 0.89 to 0.98]).
Possible Influence of Liver Disease
and Alcohol Intake
We repeated the multivariable analysis excluding subjects
who reported a physician diagnosis of active liver disease (n
remaining6953). The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for
PAD associated with a 0.1 mg/dL increase in bilirubin was
unchanged (0.93 [95% CI 0.89 to 0.98]). Further excluding
subjects with laboratory evidence of possible liver disease

unchanged (OR 0.92 [95% CI 0.87 to 0.98]).
Alcohol might influence the relationship between bilirubin
and PAD, as moderate alcohol intake may confer protection
from PAD,23 and alcohol intake could plausibly increase
serum bilirubin levels through adverse effects on liver func-
tion or induction of heme oxygenase (HO).24 In subjects with
alcohol intake data available (n6924), the multivariable-
adjusted odds ratio for PAD associated with a 0.1 mg/dL
increase in bilirubin was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.98), similar
to the whole cohort. Alcohol intake was categorized as 1
drink per day, 1 to 4 drinks per day, and 5 drinks per day,
representing 41.6%, 51.7%, and 6.8% of the subjects, respec-
tively. Mean (95% CI) bilirubin levels were 0.68 (0.67 to
0.70), 0.75 (0.73 to 0.77), and 0.76 (0.70 to 0.82) mg/dL
among subjects within the 3 categories of alcohol intake.
PAD prevalence estimates in each alcohol intake category
were 6.5% (95% CI 5.7 to 7.4), 4.1% (95% CI 3.2 to 5.2), and
4.8% (95% CI 3.2 to 7.1), respectively. The addition of
alcohol intake to the multivariable model did not change the
association of bilirubin with PAD (OR 0.93 [95% CI 0.89
to 0.98]).
Variation by Gender and Smoking
Mean bilirubin levels were lower in men with PAD (0.69
mg/dL [95% CI 0.66 to 0.72]) compared with men without
PAD (0.79 mg/dL [95% CI 0.77 to 0.81]), while mean
bilirubin levels were not different in women with PAD (0.61
mg/dL [95% CI 0.58 to 0.64]) compared with women without
PAD (0.63 mg/dL [95% CI 0.61 to 0.64]). The inverse
association of bilirubin with PAD tended to be stronger
among men (OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.96]) than among
women (OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.04]); this difference was
on the cutoff of statistical significance (Pinteraction
0.05). Ad-
ditional adjustment for HDL cholesterol did not change this
result, nor did additional adjustment for the use of hormonal
therapy in women (not shown).
Mean bilirubin levels tended to be lower in nonsmokers
with PAD (0.67 mg/dL [95% CI 0.64 to 0.70]) compared with
nonsmokers without PAD (0.72 mg/dL [95% CI 0.70 to
0.73]). Mean bilirubin levels were lower in active smokers
with PAD (0.58 mg/dL [95% CI 0.55 to 0.61]) compared with
active smokers without PAD (0.67 mg/dL [95% CI 0.65 to
0.70]). The inverse association of bilirubin with PAD was
stronger among active smokers (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.73 to
0.90]) than among non-smokers (OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.93 to
1.01]) (Pinteraction
0.006).
Given these results, we examined the multivariable-
adjusted odds for PAD in analyses stratified by both gender
and smoking status (Table 3). The inverse association of
bilirubin with PAD was strongest among active smokers,
regardless of gender. Among nonsmokers, bilirubin was
associated with PAD in men only.

In a large nationally representative cohort, we found an
independent association between increasing concentration of

serum total bilirubin and decreasing prevalence of PAD. We
did not find evidence that this association is dependent on
bilirubin levels beyond the reference range, on the presence
of liver disease, or on alcohol intake. These data, together
with evidence from experimental atherosclerosis, are consis-
tent with the hypothesis that bilirubin is an endogenous
protectant mechanism against PAD.
Inflammation and oxidative stress are essential to the
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.9­11 Bilirubin is a antioxidant
under physiological conditions and suppresses inflammation
in the vasculature.1,7 Additionally, bilirubin functions as a
cytoprotectant.6 These properties appear to allow bilirubin to
inhibit multiple steps in atherogenesis. Bilirubin inhibits
inflammatory cytokine-induced endothelial cell expression of
vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1,7 an initial step in
atherosclerosis.9 Bilirubin also inhibits monocyte transmigra-
tion,25 prevents the formation of oxidized LDL,26 inhibits
endothelial inflammation and dysfunction,8 inhibits vascular
smooth muscle proliferation,27 and prevents thrombus forma-
tion.28 Human studies demonstrate that low bilirubin is
associated with impaired endothelial function and increased
carotid intima media thickness, 2 predictors of atherosclero-
sis, in healthy individuals free of cardiovascular risk fac-
tors.29,30 These data provide a biological basis for the inverse
association of bilirubin with PAD, a manifestation of sys-
temic atherosclerosis.
It is important to consider bilirubin not in isolation but
rather in the context of it being a product of heme oxygenase
(HO), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism that
generates biliverdin, the bilirubin precursor. HO is one of
several enzymes that are induced by inflammation or oxida-
tive stress and that limit vascular damage.10 Multiple lines of
evidence support an atheroprotective role for HO-1, the
isoform of HO expressed in the blood vessel wall.31,32 HO-1
is induced by multiple cardiovascular risk factors including
smoking and hypercholesterolemia. Its induction decreases
and its inhibition increases experimental atherosclerosis.33,34
Several investigators have found that the vascular-protective
effects of HO can be reproduced by the administration of
bilirubin or biliverdin, suggesting that the production of
bilirubin is a major component of the vascular protection
offered by HO.8,25,28
Our result is similar to the inverse relationship reported
between bilirubin level and CAD.12,35 Two studies in this area
are particularly noteworthy. The first is a report of the
remarkably low prevalence of CAD in patients with Gilbert
syndrome, a hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia sec-
ondary to congenital deficiency of uridine diphosphate-
glucuronosyltransferase-1 (UGT1).36,37 The second is an
analysis of the prospective relationship between genetic
variation in UGT1 and risk for cardiovascular disease
(CVD).38 The variation in UGT1 associated with higher
bilirubin levels was associated with one-third the risk of
CVD. After adjustment for bilirubin level, the association
between UGT1 variation and CVD risk all but disappeared.
The association of bilirubin level with PAD tended to be
stronger in men than in women. Some but not all studies have
found that the relationship between bilirubin and CAD varies
by gender.20,21 The biology underlying a possible gender-
based difference in the association of bilirubin with PAD is
not clear and requires investigation. We did not find that
differences in HDL cholesterol accounted for the differential
association of bilirubin with PAD in men and women, a
possibility suggested by Hunt and colleagues.21 To the extent
that bilirubin level is related to oxidative stress,39,40 our result
is similar to finding that F2
isoprostane level is more
weakly associated with coronary calcification in women than
in men.41
We found the inverse association of bilirubin level with
PAD among active smokers to be striking. Smoking is
known to be associated with lower bilirubin levels.39 We
speculate that the potential protection offered by an en-
dogenous antioxidant such as bilirubin might be greatest
among individuals exposed to a source of oxidant stress
such as cigarette smoke.
Strengths of the present study include the national repre-
sentative nature of the NHANES cohort, that the ABI method
has excellent performance characteristics for the diagnosis of
PAD,13 and that the comprehensive nature of the NHANES
allowed adjustment for important PAD risk factors. Despite
these strengths, several limitations warrant consideration. The
ABI was determined from the blood pressure in a single arm
and subjects 60 years of age had the blood pressure
measured only once, potential sources of misclassification: a
cohort within which the blood pressure was measured more
than once in each limb could provide a more precise estimate
of the association of bilirubin with PAD. Plasma bilirubin
levels exhibit significant within subject variability42; the
NHANES performs only a single blood draw, perhaps further
limiting the precision of our bilirubin effect estimate. Also,
the antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties of bilirubin
may vary depending whether it is conjugated or unconju-
gated,4 and the NHANES only measured total and not
fractionated bilirubin level. Although this cross-sectional
study demonstrates an association of increased serum biliru-
bin with reduced prevalence of PAD, prospective studies are
needed to determine the temporal nature of the association,
and causation cannot be established. Reverse causation is a
possible explanation for our findings, although prospective
studies have demonstrated an inverse association of bilirubin
level with cardiovascular risk.38 The finding that the associ-
ation of bilirubin level with risk for ischemic heart disease
may in fact be U-shaped highlights the need for prospective
studies of bilirubin level and risk for PAD.43,44
In summary, increased serum total bilirubin level is asso-
ciated with a reduced likelihood of PAD. This association is
not dependent on elevated bilirubin levels, liver disease, or
alcohol intake, is stronger in men compared with women, and
is stronger in smokers compared with nonsmokers. Further
work, including prospective epidemiological studies, is
needed to better illuminate the role of bilirubin in determining
susceptibility to PAD. Bilirubin, with strong antiinflamma-
tory and antioxidant properties, may be an important endog-
enous protectant from PAD.
