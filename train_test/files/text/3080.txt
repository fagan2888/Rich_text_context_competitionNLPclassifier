The Quality of Care for Depressive and Anxiety
Disorders in the United States
Alexander S. Young, MD, MSHS; Ruth Klap, PhD; Cathy D. Sherbourne, PhD; Kenneth B. Wells, MD, MPH
Background: Depressiveandanxietydisordersarepreva-
lent and cause substantial morbidity. While effective treat-
ments exist, little is known about the quality of care for
these disorders nationally. We estimated the rate of ap-
propriate treatment among the US population with these
disorders, and the effect of insurance, provider type, and
individual characteristics on receipt of appropriate care.
Methods: Data are from a cross-sectional telephone sur-
vey conducted during 1997 and 1998 with a national
sample. Respondents consisted of 1636 adults with a prob-
able 12-month depressive or anxiety disorder as deter-
mined by brief diagnostic interview. Appropriate treat-
ment was defined as present if the respondent had used
medication or counseling that was consistent with treat-
ment guidelines.
Results: During a 1-year period, 83% of adults with a
probable depressive or anxiety disorder saw a health care
provider (95% confidence interval [CI], 81%-85%) and
30% received some appropriate treatment (95% CI,
28%-33%). Most visited primary care providers only. Ap-
propriate care was received by 19% in this group (95%
CI, 16%-23%) and by 90% of individuals visiting men-
tal health specialists (95% CI, 85%-94%). Appropriate
treatment was less likely for men and those who were
black, less educated, or younger than 30 or older than
59 years (range, 19-97 years). Insurance and income had
no effect on receipt of appropriate care.
Conclusions: It is possible to evaluate mental health care
quality on a national basis. Most adults with a probable
depressive or anxiety disorder do not receive appropri-
ate care for their disorder. While this holds across di-
verse groups, appropriate care is less common in cer-
tain demographic subgroups.

DEPRESSIVE AND anxiety
disorders are common
and have a substantial im-
pact on functioning and
quality of life. National
treatment guidelines for major depres-
sion document that effective treatments in-
clude antidepressant medications and cog-
nitive-behavioral and interpersonal
psychotherapies.1-5 Research also sup-
ports the efficacy of these treatments for
dysthymia, although the literature is less
well developed.5-9 In panic disorder, treat-
ment guidelines strongly support the ef-
ficacy of cognitive-behavioral psychothera-
pies, some antidepressant medications, and
benzodiazepines.10,11 In generalized anxi-
ety disorder (GAD), effective treatments
include antidepressant medications, bu-
spirone, benzodiazepines, cognitive-
behavioral psychotherapies, and prob-
ably relaxation and unstructured therapy
techniques.12-15 Although these treat-
ments are effective, patients frequently do
not receive them.16 However, there have
been few national studies of the quality of
mental health care. Researchers have suc-
cessfully characterized national quality of
care for a variety of medical disorders,17
and it is important to know whether simi-
lar research in psychiatry can provide data
to inform policy nationally. While the ex-
isting literature suggests that quality of care
for common psychiatric disorders is mod-
erate to poor across different types of treat-
ment settings, national data are limited and
not clinically detailed, and it is unclear
which populations are at greatest risk for
not receiving appropriate care.
The National Comorbidity Survey
(NCS) surveyed a household probability
sample of persons between ages 14 and 55
years, and found that 27.7% of those with
major depression and 26.0% of those with
dysthymia reported receiving outpatient
mental health services,18 while 35.2% with
panic disorder and 31.8% with GAD re-
ported receiving such services. Although
rates of use of antidepressant medication
were low for persons with major depres-

cording to national practice guidelines is uncertain.19 Fur-
thermore, NCS respondents only reported general medi-
cal visits that they thought included care for mental health
problems, and this approach could lead to undercounting
of mental health services since many general medical pa-
tients may not recognize that they have an emotional prob-
lem.20 Otherwise, studies of quality of care for depressive
oranxietydisordersarelimitedtoreportsfromspecificprac-
tice settings. For example, a study of primary care prac-
tices in the 1980s found that 25% to 30% of those with ma-
jor depression received antidepressant medication during
a 6-month period,16 and studies in a variety of other health
care organizations have produced similar results.21-24 The
rate of appropriate treatment for persons with anxiety dis-
ordermayalsobelow,buttherearefewpractice-basedstud-
ies. Even in mental health specialty settings, effective treat-
ments for anxiety disorders may be underutilized.25-28
Researchers have found lower rates of mental health
treatment utilization in men,29 ethnic minorities,30 and
individuals with lower socioeconomic status.31 Also, black,
young adult, and elderly individuals have been found to
be less likely to visit mental health specialists,32 and this
may affect which treatments are received.33 With regard
to insurance, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study
found that access to care was better under Medicaid than
for the uninsured or those with private insurance,34 and
the Medical Outcomes Study found that some aspects of
treatment were worse in prepaid care.16 However, these
results were based on coverage in the 1980s and few re-
cent studies have identified predictors of receiving ap-
propriate care among persons at risk for common psy-
chiatric disorders.
This is a study of access to appropriate care among
a representative household sample of adults in the United
States who had a symptomatic depressive or anxiety dis-
order during a 1-year period in 1997 and 1998. The fo-
cus is on individuals with probable major depression, dys-
thymia, panic disorder, and GAD. We examine whether
these individuals visit a health care provider, whether
those visiting a provider receive appropriate treatment,
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE
The sample is from HealthCare for Communities (HCC),
which is part of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's
Health Tracking Initiative. Data are from the HCC tele-
phone survey, which was conducted during 1997 and 1998.
The design of HCC is described in detail elsewhere.35 Health-
Care for Communities respondents were a stratified prob-
ability sample of participants in the Community Tracking
Study (CTS). The CTS was a nationally representative study
of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population during
1996 and 1997, with a response rate of 65%.36 The sam-
pling strategy in HCC was designed to improve our ability
to study people with low income and people with psychi-
atric disorders. This was done by oversampling individu-
als with the following characteristics: family income be-
low $20000, high psychological distress (measured using
2 items from the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey37), or
any mental health specialty visit during the prior year. Of
the 14985 CTS respondents selected for HCC, 9585 were
reinterviewed, for a response rate of 64%. Informed con-
sent was obtained verbally before the interview. In analy-
ses, we weighted the data to be representative of the popu-
lation of the United States by using CTS data to adjust for
probability of selection, unit nonresponse, and nontele-
phone households.
MEASURES
Data are from the HCC survey, with the exception of some
insurance information and demographics from the CTS sur-
vey. Major depression, dysthymia, and GAD during the past
year and lifetime mania were assessed using short-form ver-
sions of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view (CIDI),38 and are based on DSM-III-R criteria.39 Kessler
and colleagues38 reported that the sensitivity and specific-
ity of CIDI short-form relative to full CIDI diagnosis is
excellent, with concordance ranging from 90% to 100%.
Probable panic disorder was assessed using screening items
from the CIDI,40 supplemented by additional items from
the full battery that were modified for this study. To re-
duce potential false-positives on this instrument, for panic
we required limitation in social or role functioning using
2 items from the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 3
items from the Sickness Impact Profile.41 Substance abuse
was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identifica-
tion Test42 and items adapted from the CIDI. Chronic psy-
chosis was assessed by asking respondents whether they
had ever been told they had schizophrenia or schizoaffec-
tive disorder, or been hospitalized because of psychotic
symptoms. Two hundred forty respondents met criteria for
chronic psychosis or mania and were excluded from our
analyses. Respondents were also asked whether, during the
past year, they had a need for emotional or mental health
help, and whether they had any of the following severe life
difficulties: witnessing an assault, losing custody of chil-
dren, or being homeless, sexually assaulted, incarcerated,
or on parole or probation.
Use of health services during the prior 12 months
was identified by self-report. Primary care provider (PCP)
visits included visits, for any reason, to a primary care
physician, family physician, general internist, nurse, phy-
sician assistant, or chiropractor. Mental health specialist
visits included visits to a psychiatrist, psychologist, social
worker, psychiatric nurse, or counselor, for "emotional or
mental health problems." Respondents provided daily
dosage and duration of use for medications taken "at least
several times a week for a month or more," and reported
on the number of counseling sessions with specialists.
Counseling from PCPs was identified by asking whether
the health care visit included at least 5 minutes of coun-
seling regarding an "emotional, mental health, alcohol or
drug problem."
Appropriate care for depressive and anxiety disor-
ders was assessed for respondents with a probable disor-
der, and was defined as use of either appropriate psycho-
tropic medication or appropriate counseling during the prior

and, overall, the probability of receiving appropriate care.
We also analyze the effect of demographic factors, in-
surance type, and provider visits on receipt of appropri-
ate treatment.
RESULTS
There were 174 respondents with dysthymia alone, 831
with major depression alone, and 317 with both disor-
ders. There were 139 respondents with panic disorder
alone, 146 with GAD alone, and 29 with both anxiety dis-
orders. In total, 1636 respondents met criteria for 1 or
more depressive or anxiety disorders, and Table 1 pre-
sents the characteristics of these individuals. Compared
with other persons, individuals with a depressive or anxi-
ety disorder were significantly more likely to be female,
unmarried, unemployed, and to have problems with drugs
or alcohol (P.0001, for each comparison). They also
had significantly fewer years of education, lower family
income, more life difficulties and chronic medical dis-
orders, and were more likely to have no medical insur-
ance (P.0001 for each comparison). While respon-
dents provided information on medical insurance, they
were often unaware of their specific mental health ben-
efits, and hence this could not be assessed.
VISITS TO PROVIDERS AND USE OF MENTAL
HEALTH TREATMENTS
During a 1-year period, 80.8% of individuals with a prob-
able anxiety or depressive disorder saw a PCP. While
19.4% had seen a mental health specialist, only 1.9% saw
a specialist without seeing a PCP. Primary care provider
contact was most common with the anxiety disorders,
and specialist contact was most common when both anxi-
ety and depressive disorders were present (Table 2). Al-
though provider visits were common, receipt of mental
health treatment was not. Among individuals with a prob-
able disorder, 25.6% received some antidepressant or anx-
iolytic medication, and 20.6% received appropriate medi-
cation; 31.3% received some counseling, and 17.6%
received appropriate counseling. In all, 30.4% received
year. Appropriate psychotropic medication was defined
as a medication that was efficacious for the individual's
disorder and used at a dosage exceeding the minimum
recommended dosage for an adequate duration. Specifi-
cally, for major depressive and dysthymic disorder (with
or without anxiety), we used the lower end of the thera-
peutic dosage range for each antidepressant medication
from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research
Guideline for Depression in Primary Care, updated for
newer medications,1 and required 2 or more months of
use during the prior 12 months. Examples of minimum
dosages are 10 mg per day for fluoxetine and 75 mg per
day for desipramine. For panic disorder (with or without
GAD), appropriateness criteria were based on proposed
guidelines for general practitioners.10 Medication was
appropriate if it included at least 2 months of an antide-
pressant medication (other than bupropion) at a possi-
bly adequate dosage, or a benzodiazepine. For GAD,
medication was considered appropriate if it included at
least 2 months of an antidepressant medication at an
adequate dosage, buspirone, or a benzodiazepine. For
respondents with multiple disorders, appropriateness
was evaluated for their most "significant" clinical disor-
der, based on the following hierarchy (from 1 to 4, in
order of consideration by PCP): major depression (1),
dysthymia (2), panic disorder (3), and GAD (4). To
illustrate the rationale behind this hierarchy, an indi-
vidual with comorbid major depression and panic disor-
der has appropriate treatment for both disorders if he or
she has any appropriate treatment for depression (eg, an
antidepressant); however, certain treatments for panic
disorder (eg, a benzodiazepine alone without counsel-
ing) would not be sufficient.
Appropriate counseling was defined as at least 4 vis-
its with a mental health specialist or 4 visits with a PCP
that included counseling for mental health problems. A very
similar counseling definition was used in the Medical Out-
comes Study, which found that appropriate counseling or
medication use was associated with improved 2-year func-
tional outcomes in depression.43
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
EstimateswerecalculatedusingSUDAANsoftware,44 andtake
into account the complex survey design and survey cluster-
ing. Differences between percentages were evaluated using
Wald statistics converted to F statistics.45 Multiple logistic re-
gression was used to examine the effect of individual, ill-
ness,andinsurancecharacteristicsonbothuseofservicesand
receipt of appropriate care. The population for all the main
modelsconsistedofindividualswithprobabledepression,dys-
thymia, panic, or GAD. Dependent variables were dichoto-
mous, and indicated the presence of at least 1 service or ap-
propriate care. Independent variables were the same in each
model, and included age, sex, ethnic group, marital status,
years of education, income, number of chronic medical dis-
orders, and presence of a severe life difficulty or alcohol or
other drug problem. Primary medical insurance was en-
tered into the models as one of the following: private health
maintenance organization, other private insurance, Medi-
care, Medicaid, uninsured, or other/unknown. Physical and
mental health functioning scores from the 12-Item Short-
Form Health Survey were included in the models to control
for severity of illness. We calculated standardized predic-
tions for variables in the models by computing the average
predicted probabilities of obtaining quality care, controlling
for other covariates, within sample subgroups of interest.
We examined the sensitivity of our approach to changes
in the methods used to identify appropriate treatment. To
do this, we developed alternative regression models that
had the same independent and dependent variables, but ex-
amined a somewhat different population. First, since our
main method could have included respondents with mild
illnesses, we restricted the population identified as having
a disorder to individuals with a limitation in social or role
functioning (as defined above). Second, since our main
method may have missed individuals who did not meet re-
quirements for illness during the past year because of suc-
cessful treatment, we expanded the population identified
as having a disorder to include all individuals taking anti-
depressant medication.

at least 1 appropriate treatment for their disorder (95%
CI, 27.7%-33.1%). The highest rates of treatment were
found in people with both an anxiety and a depressive
disorder.
FACTORS AFFECTING PROVIDER CONTACT
AND TREATMENT QUALITY
Within people with a depressive or anxiety disorder, pro-
vider contact was significantly more likely among indi-
viduals with more years of education or a greater num-
ber of medical disorders, and was less likely among
individuals with no medical insurance (Table 3). On
the other hand, receipt of appropriate care was strongly
influenced by demographic factors and not by presence
or type of insurance. As shown in Table 3, receipt of ap-
propriate care was affected by the same factors in people
who had seen a provider as in the general population.
Specifically, the odds of receiving appropriate care var-
ied significantly by sex, ethnicity, age, and years of edu-
cation, but not by income or insurance. The standard-
ized prediction of appropriate care was 33% for women,
26% for men, 34% for whites, 24% for Hispanics, and 17%
for blacks. In terms of age, older and younger people were
both less likely to receive appropriate care. The stan-
dardized prediction of appropriate care was 20% for ages
18 to 29 years, 37% for ages 30 to 39 years, 32% for ages
40 to 49 years, 37% for ages 50 to 59 years, and 22% for
60 years and older.
Overall, poor-quality care (defined as no care or in-
appropriate care) was quite common. Poor-quality care oc-
curred in 80.5% of individuals with PCP visits only (95%
CI, 77.3%-83.8%), 11.4% of individuals with mental health
specialist visits only (95% CI, 0.0%-24.7%), and 10.1% of
individuals with both types of visits (95% CI, 5.1%-15.2%).
Within patients seeing PCPs, those receiving poor-quality
care were less likely to report that mental health problems
were evaluated (35.6% vs 65.3%, P.0001), psychiatric
medications were recommended (11.4% vs 55.7%,
P.0001), or a referral to a mental health specialist was
made (4.1% vs 23.5%, P.0001). The overall population
with poor-quality care was much less likely to perceive a
need for mental health care (31.4% vs 70.0%, P.0001).
COMMENT
This project indicates that it is possible to nationally evalu-
ate and monitor treatment quality for psychiatric condi-
tions, just as quality has been evaluated in other medi-
cal disorders. When care is examined, the rate of access
to appropriate treatment for depressive and anxiety dis-
orders is quite low, under 35% for the US adult popula-
tion with a disorder, although closer to 50% for those with
both types of disorder. These findings reflect practice and
utilization patterns in 1997 and 1998, well within the era
of newer antidepressant medications and widespread dis-
semination of managed care in primary and specialty care.

treatment occur even among persons receiving health care.
In fact, 76% of individuals with poor-quality care had seen
a health care professional during a 1-year period. Most
had been seen in primary care settings, making these
promising locations for identifying individuals who could
benefit from treatment. While the chances of appropri-
ate care are much higher for individuals who have men-
tal health specialist contact, these are probably individu-
als who are more accepting of psychiatric diagnosis and
treatment. We found that persons not receiving appro-
priate care were much less likely to think they needed
treatment for an emotional problem. Primary care pro-
viders carry the burden of recognizing cases among pa-
tients not presenting for psychological treatment, a task
that mental health specialists may not have to face.
The policy significance of our findings is enhanced
by identification of individuals at highest risk for not re-
ceiving appropriate care for a depressive or anxiety dis-
order. A large amount of the literature suggests that the
effect of insurance on quality is inconsistent.46 We found
that insurance had a significant effect on whether an ill
individual would see a provider, but no effect on whether
appropriate care would be received. In part, this may have
occurred because most visits were in primary care, where
the rate of appropriate treatment was low. We were un-
able to evaluate generosity of specific coverage for men-
tal health services because people were too uncertain about
this aspect of their insurance. This is an important area
for further study. In any case, our findings suggest that
quality problems exist across insurance types and the un-
insured. This is consistent with previous studies sug-
gesting that simply providing insurance is unlikely to sub-
stantially improve rates of appropriate care in people with
mental health disorders.47 Rather, quality improvement
programs may need to be implemented within various
types of insurance programs and in the public sector to
enhance awareness and utilization of appropriate treat-
ment options.
Unlike insurance, demographic factors had little ef-
fect on whether an individual would see a provider, but
a large effect on whether appropriate care would be re-
ceived. For instance, despite the fact that blacks are as
likely as whites to see a provider, they are significantly
less likely to receive appropriate care. This ethnic dis-
parity in quality of care is similar to findings for a vari-
ety of other medical conditions.48 Overall, groups at very
high risk include men, blacks, older adults, young adults,
and people with less than a high school education. Our
findings are consistent with numerous studies showing
that women are much more likely than men to use out-
patient mental health services.29 We also find that lower
socioeconomic status is strongly associated with not re-

ceiving appropriate care. These risk factors hold in both
in the general population and in the population that sees
a health care provider. Our findings emphasize the sa-
lience of the surgeon general's current efforts to redress
differences in quality of care for major disease condi-
tions based on socioeconomic or ethnic status differ-
ences, and suggest that major psychiatric conditions
should be considered for such an effort.
An encouraging finding was that when an antide-
pressant or anxiolytic medication is used, it is often used
at a dosage and duration that may be effective. This sug-
gests that the main problem is identifying those in need,
offering them appropriate care, and helping them ac-
cept this care. This represents a change from the 1980s,
and may be because of the widespread availability of se-
lective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications that are
relatively easy to use at an effective dosage. Indeed, we
found that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors now
account for 56% of all antidepressant medications used
for depression and anxiety, and are usually prescribed
at an adequate dosage. For counseling, there was a greater
difference between using any counseling and receiving
appropriate care, with less than half of those with any
counseling receiving at least 4 sessions. With benefits de-
clining and behavioral managed care becoming more
prevalent, it may be more difficult to obtain more than a
few visits, or there may be other barriers such as pa-
tients not perceiving a need for ongoing counseling or
experiencing financial barriers, such as copayments.
One limitation of this study is that we used a brief di-
agnosticscreeninginstrumenttoidentifypeoplewithaprob-
able disorder. Indeed, brief measures are required when
implementingqualityassessmentinlargenationalsamples.
A recent study compared a similar brief diagnostic assess-
ment with a structured, clinical assessment, and found that
the brief assessment was highly specific, though not very
sensitive.49 Therefore, one would expect that most of the
people we identified had, in fact, a depressive or anxiety
disorder. Also, to examine the sensitivity of our approach
to variation in severity of illness, we reran the model pre-
dicting appropriate care after confining the population to
those with a functional limitation (n=1201). In the popu-
lation with a depressive or anxiety disorder plus a func-
tionallimitation,thepositivepredictivevalueofourscreen-
ers should be even higher (and need for treatment quite
certain).Theonlysubstantivedifferencebetweenthismodel
and the main model was that that having a chronic medi-
cal disorder was more strongly associated with receiving
appropriate care. Finally, the Partners in Care Study50 ex-
amined persons who met screening criteria for probable
depressivedisorderbutdidnothavecurrentdisorderbased
on full diagnostic assessment, and found that their out-
comes improved with a quality improvement program.
Thus, rates of treatment among a broader at-risk sample
are meaningful to practice policy.
Our use of a cross-sectional strategy to select indi-
viduals with a disorder means that we cannot distin-
guish chronic refractory illness from incident condi-
tions, or identify people who were successfully treated
more than a year before the interview, and had no symp-
toms for the past year because of continued treatment.
To examine the effect that this may have had, we ran sen-
sitivity analyses in a population that in included people
with a depressive or anxiety disorder plus people who
had no disorder but were using antidepressant medica-
tion. Using this alternative approach, the rate of appro-
priate care increased from 30.4% to 40.2%, but predic-
tors of appropriate care did not change.
It is noteworthy that we found low rates of appro-
priate care, even though we used a generous definition
of appropriate counseling, requiring only 4 professional
visits and only 5 minutes of discussion in a primary care
visit. We were unable to measure the content of coun-
seling visits or to reliably identify specific forms of ef-
fective treatments. Indeed, a criterion standard for de-
fining effective counseling in the context of usual practice
does not exist. Also, our reliance on self-report of ser-
vice use could have led to underreporting or misreport-
ing of medication usage or counseling. However, our
model was robust to variation in our assumptions, and
our major findings were determined mostly by the pres-
ence of any potentially effective treatment. Also, the
method we used to measure appropriateness is very simi-
lar to that used in the Medical Outcomes Study,16,43 which
demonstrated that this definition of treatment appropri-
ateness affects outcomes.
Another potential limitation of this study is that the
accuracy of the results may have been affected by the re-
sponse rate, which is compounded by the initial re-
sponse rate in CTS. We adjusted our findings statisti-
cally for response using detailed CTS information on
nonrespondents. While we cannot know the extent to
which this adjustment was successful, features of our find-
ings are consistent with prior research. Compared with
NCS, we found similar prevalence estimates for disor-
ders, similar rates of treatment utilization in anxiety, and
modestly higher rates of treatment utilization in depres-
sion. In primary care, we found rates of mental health
treatment use that are similar to those reported by the
Medical Outcomes Study using 1980s data.
Many factors can contribute to why people who need
care do not receive it.51 These include, for instance, per-
ceived need, willingness to accept care, insurance cover-
age, detection by providers, and knowledge and beliefs of
providers regarding effective treatment. Findings from this
study support efforts to improve care through either pub-
lic education or quality improvement interventions. Re-
cent research suggests that while a majority of the public
identifies major depression as a mental illness, psychiatric
disorders continue to be strongly stigmatized.52 We found
that people not receiving appropriate care were much less
likely to have had their mental health problems evalu-
ated, and much less likely to believe they needed mental
health treatment. Public and patient education efforts are
needed to increase the extent to which people value treat-
ment for common psychiatric disorders and demand ap-
propriate care. Quality improvement efforts should focus
on strategies that bring effective treatments to people--
whether through improving practice infrastructure, en-
hancing benefit design, or implementing outreach pro-
grams. Clinical research has made substantial progress in
establishing efficacious treatments, and progress must now
proceed on dissemination to the public, especially for vul-
nerable subpopulations.
