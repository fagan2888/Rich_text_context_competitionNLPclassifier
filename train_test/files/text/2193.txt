Purpose: This study was designed to improve the
measurement of financial exploitation (FE) by testing
psychometric properties of the older adult financial
exploitation measure (OAFEM), a client self-report
instrument. Design and Methods: Rasch item
response theory and traditional validation approaches
were used. Questionnaires were administered by 22
adult protective services investigators from 7 agencies
in Illinois to 227 substantiated abuse clients. Analyses
included tests for dimensionality, model fit, and addi-
tional construct validation. Results from the OAFEM
were also compared with the substantiation decision of
abuse and with investigators' assessments of FE using
a staff report version. Hypotheses were generated
to test hypothesized relationships. Results: The
OAFEM, including the original 79-, 54-, and 30-item
measures, met stringent Rasch analysis fit and unidi-
mensionality criteria and had high internal consistency
and item reliability. The validation results were support-
ive, while leading to reconsideration of aspects of
the hypothesized theoretical hierarchy. Thresholds
were suggested to demonstrate levels of severity.

Implications: The measure is now available to aid
in the assessment of FE of older adults by both clini-
cians and researchers. Theoretical refinements devel-
oped using the empirically generated item hierarchy
may help to improve assessment and intervention.

In the last 30 years, because elder mistreatment
began to be widely recognized by social scientists,
strides have been made to identify, measure, and
substantiate abuse. Building on a seminal report
by the National Research Council (2003), research
has focused on improving the measurement of
elder mistreatment to understand better the scope
of the problem and the associated risk and protec-
tive factors. Cooper, Selwood, and Livingston
(2008) in a systematic review of elder mistreatment
prevalence studies through October 2008 identi-
fied 49 such studies conducted in more than a
dozen countries. However, they did not identify
any studies specifically devoted to the conceptual-
ization and measurement of financial exploitation
(FE) of older adults. FE is a unique category of
elder mistreatment that does not have previously
developed scales to draw from as do other forms
of abuse. As a result, empirical studies of FE have
lagged.
FE has been defined as the illegal or improper
use of a vulnerable adult's funds or property
for another person's profit or advantage (AARP
International, 2006; National Center on Elder
Abuse, 1998). In practice, FE may be difficult to
detect for a variety of reasons. For example, the
onset is often gradual and insidious and, lacking
oversight, subtle deception may mimic legitimate
transactions and escalate over time. Differentiat-
ing FE from legitimate transactions is challenging
Vol. 50, No. 6, 2010 759
in that there may be indications of consent by the
older adult, for example, a signed document and
an apparent gift, when in fact the perpetrator has
used psychological manipulation or misrepresen-
tation (Wilber & Reynolds, 1996). Cognitive
impairment, sensory impairment, or lack of finan-
cial sophistication may also cloud the distinction
between willing assent and FE. Risks for FE may
increase for older adults with paid or unpaid care-
givers who have access to their financial assets,
such as bank accounts, investment funds, etc.
(Anetzberger, 2000). Differentiating FE from legit-
imate resource sharing and gifting is especially dif-
ficult when the elder is not a reliable reporter
because of cognitive impairment, coercion, or con-
cern about what will happen to the suspected
abuser. In addition, other factors such as different
cultural perceptions of sharing wealth may blur
the distinction between generosity and exploita-
tion (Langan & Means, 1996). (For a more com-
prehensive review of the FE literature, see Conrad
et al., in press; Hafemeister, 2003.)
Conceptual Models
Although conceptual development in elder
abuse research is sparse, several authors have sug-
gested theoretical approaches to guide data collec-
tion efforts and provide effective assessment of
the risk factors for and the consequences of differ-
ent types of abuse (Anetzberger, 2000; Godkin,
Wolf, & Pillemer, 1989). For FE, a number of
indicators of abuse have been identified, for exam-
ple, suspicious signatures on checks, missing docu-
mentation about financial arrangements, and
unusual banking activities (National Committee
for the Prevention of Elder Abuse, 2008; Quinn &
Tomita, 1997).
Over the last decade, there have been several
efforts to develop broader conceptual frameworks
specific to FE. For example, Wilber and Reynolds
(1996) identified four components of financial
elder abuse: vulnerabilities of the elder; character-
istics of the relationship between the older adult
and the alleged perpetrator; an assessment of who
benefits from the relationship and how; and con-
sideration of the process and tactics used and
whether or not these meet the standards of undue
influence, deceit, coercion, or theft. Building on
this framework, Kemp and Mosqueda (2005)
developed and tested a model, that added several
new areas, including the older adult or the transac-
tions are kept isolated, controlled, or secret; a
qualified expert assesses neither the elder's capac-
ities nor whether the transaction was in the older
adult's best interest; common business or personal
ethics are not followed; and the perpetrator does
not consider the effect on others including the victim,
family, beneficiaries, or the public welfare system.
Rabiner, O'Keeffe, and Brown (2004) presented
a comprehensive conceptual model that included
micro processes such as power and exchange
dynamics, characteristics of the relationship in
addition to the victim and perpetrator, status
inequality, and social networks. They also included
the broader sociocultural and policy context to
understand better the etiology of FE.
These various models have several commonali-
ties; primary among them is that they recognize
the importance of including the perpetrator and
his or her characteristics as well as the social net-
work. In addition, the relationship itself must be
assessed in terms of the (a) extent to which the per-
petrator is in a "position of trust," (b) status
inequality between perpetrator and victim, (c) pat-
terns of interaction over time, and (d) extent to
which there is reciprocity versus highly skewed
benefits and losses. Although the models help
explain the etiology of general abuse and the
nature of financial abuse, neither do they present
examples of statements that represent individual
components of FE nor do they indicate which
components are most important or most severe.
Understanding these issues is essential to obtaining
accurate assessments of types and levels of exploi-
tation. To address the latter issue, Conrad and
colleagues (in press) developed a model using
concept mapping that included five concepts in a
severity hierarchy that resulted in a measure called
the older adult financial exploitation measure
(OAFEM). The initial OAFEM measure, upon
which this study was based, was developed using
three-dimensional concept mapping applying the
Trochim (1989) mapping technique. Following
this approach, concept maps for FE were devel-
oped using two sources. Statements were gener-
ated first from a literature review of all empirical
and conceptual work on FE available. Subse-
quently local and national panels of experts (n =
16) brainstormed descriptive statements of key
behaviors related to FE. In this way, any state-
ments from the literature that were not suggested
by the experts were included by the authors for
consideration. The panel of experts then reviewed
the list of behaviors, rating the severity of each,
conceptually sorting the statements into groups,
The Gerontologist

and naming each group. This information was
analyzed and visually presented as "point and clus-
ter maps" using Concept Systems Software (Kane &
Trochim, 2007) that illustrated relationships
among the FE behaviors as well as their severity
ratings (Conrad et al., in press). Statements were
grouped into six clusters, visually depicted as maps,
and ranked by the experts as follows in descending
severity: (a) theft and scams, (b) financial victim-
ization, (c) financial entitlement, (d) coercion, (e)
signs of possible FE, and (f) money management
difficulties (Conrad et al., in press). The statements
developed for the concept map were subsequently
made into questions, and questionnaires were
developed for both staff observation and client
self-report. Nine focus groups, six involving
44 staff from various agencies and three involving
20 older adult consumers, were conducted to
review and refine the wording of the questions.
Four cognitive interviews of the client measures
were then conducted with substantiated elder abuse
clients whose input was also incorporated. The
resulting questionnaire consisted of 82 questions.
Details of these focus groups and other qualitative
work are beyond the scope of this article, but may
be reviewed in Conrad, Iris, and Ridings (2009).
Purpose of the Study
This article reports on the next stage in the
development of the OAFEM in which field tests
were used to evaluate the instrument. Accordingly,
we examined client self-report measures of FE
using item response theory, including Rasch mod-
eling, and traditional validation techniques. Our
specific objectives were to: (a) test the fit of the
items to the model; (b) test the construct dimen-
sionality of the OAFEM by examining whether or
not the items formed a single overarching FE con-
struct; (c) assess internal consistency reliability for
all forms using a standard of .80 person reliability;
(d) develop short forms that would be user-friendly
for clinical applications; (e) examine the appropri-
ateness of the measure for the target population,
that is, items centering on the sample as opposed
to having floor and ceiling effects; (f) further test
construct validity by positing a hierarchy of con-
cept rankings that conforms to expectations devel-
oped in the prior research phase and then testing a
set of hypothesized relationships using correlation
analysis; and (g) propose a reasonable, although
speculative given lack of external validation, cutoff
to determine FE.
Design and Methods
Sample
Datacollectionwassupportedthrougharesearch
agreement with the Illinois Department on Aging
(IDoA), which helped recruit elder abuse providers
in the state. Seven adult protective services (APS)
agencies in Chicago and its collar counties assisted
in the development of a database to estimate the
psychometric properties of two types of FE mea-
sures: APS client self-report and APS investigator
(staff) assessments. We used data from client self-
report measures of FE administered via interview
by 22 staff to 227 clients who were substantiated
for at least one type of elder mistreatment. We
included substantiated clients to ensure a target
sample that was appropriate for the measures. To
obtain the full range of the construct and include a
substantial group in the "floor," however, clients
did not have to be substantiated for FE.
In addition to administering the interview, the
APS staff who participated completed a staff obser-
vation questionnaire on each of the clients they
interviewed. Staff received training on the proto-
cols, including interviewing clients, by the two lead
authors. A key component of the interview was the
assessment of cognitive status using the mini-mental
state examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, &
McHugh, 1975). To participate in the study, the
client had to score at least 17 on the MMSE or, in
the judgment of the APS investigator, demonstrate
adequate cognitive capacity to provide self-report.
The human subjects research proposal and informed
consent forms were approved by the University of
Illinois at Chicago (UIC) internal review board
via the human subjects subcommittee. All partici-
pating APS staff completed the human subjects
committee online training program of UIC. As
shown in Table 1, the staff sample (n = 22) was

predominantly women (86.36%). More than half
was Caucasian (59.09%), a quarter was African
American (27.27%), and the remainder Hispanic
or mixed race. Average years of experience were
5.46 years. In Table 2, the sample of APS clients
(n = 227) was also predominantly women (70.4%).
The majority was African American (61.3%), more
than one third was Caucasian (35.5%), and the
remainder was of mixed race or other. Most were
non-Hispanic (92.9%). The majority was between
75 and 90 years (58.7%).
Statistical Analysis
The Rasch measurement model (Rasch, 1960)
was chosen because of its desirable scaling proper-
ties of linear, interval measurement (Embretson &
Reise, 2000). This was important to accurately
establish item hierarchy and distances between
items to support theory building and test construct
validity. Therefore, the Rasch model was needed
to test the theoretical hierarchy developed in prior
work. This is a type of construct validation. The
Rasch hierarchy was also useful in examining
dimensionality, examining the rating scale, testing
the fit of items to the model, and in suggesting pos-
sible cutoff scores. These are also aspects of con-
struct validation that can be facilitated with the
Rasch model.
The Rasch rating scale model (Wright &
Masters, 1982), used for this analysis, estimates
the probability that a respondent will choose a
particular response category for an item as
-
= - -
( 1)
ln ,
nij
n i j
ni j
P
B D F
P
where Pnij
is the probability of respondent
n scoring in category j of item i, Pni
(j-1) is the
probability of respondent n scoring in category
j - 1 of item i, Bn
is the person measure of respon-
dent n, Di
is the difficulty of item i, and Fj
is the
difficulty of category step j. Rating scale categories
are ordered steps on the measurement scale. Com-
pleting the jth step can be thought of as choosing
the jth alternative over the (j - 1)th in the response
to the item.
Rasch analysis places persons (Bn
) and items
(Di
) on the same measurement scale where the unit
of measurement is the logit (log odds unit).
Although person reliability in Rasch is analogous
to Cronbach's alpha in true score theory (Nunnally &
Bernstein, 1994), it is more conservative (usually
lower) because it estimates standard errors (SEs)
for each person and each item (vs. test-wide SE for
alpha), thereby indicating how reliably persons and
items are placed on the scale. Alphas are provided
for those who prefer them, but we note that they
tend to give high estimates due to the inclusion of
zero and extreme high scores in their calculation.
Using the Winsteps Computer Program for these
calculations (Linacre, 2009), reliability estimates
were calculated from 0 to 1.00 on scales that are
actually infinite in either direction (Linacre, 2002).
Dimensionality.--Because the Rasch model
requires unidimensionality, principal component
analysis of residuals is used to examine whether a
substantial factor exists in the residuals after the
primary measurement dimension has been esti-
mated (Linacre, 1998a; Smith, 2002). Although
there are no hard rules for interpreting principal
components results, our rule of thumb for unidi-
mensionality was variance explained of greater
than 40% by the measurement dimension (Linacre,
2006). For comparison, Reckase (1979) used 20%
to define a substantial factor. To be conservative in
testing a second dimension, we set less than 15%
(even lower than Reckase) as the criterion for vari-
ance explained by the first principal component of
the residuals, that is, the second dimension. Simply
put, using 40% and 15% variance as the criteria
for the first and second dimensions is a rigorous
test in that the measurement dimension must be

large at 40%, whereas the second dimension
must be quite small at under 15%. We also tested
dimensionality using the procedure of Linacre
(1998b). We extracted two subsets of items rep-
resenting the opposite poles of the factor. We
then measured each subject on each subset of
items. We cross-plotted the subject measures and
obtained correlation coefficients. Additional cri-
teria for unidimensionality were employed using
item fit statistics discussed next.
Quality Control With Fit Statistics.--Rasch anal-
ysis provides fit statistics to test assumptions of
fundamental measurement (Wright & Stone,
1979). "Fitting the model" simply means meeting
basic assumptions of measurement, for example,
high scorers should endorse or get right almost all
of the easy items. Once identified, persons and
items that "misfit" can be examined qualitatively
to determine the causes of the problems, which
may include items with confusing wording or items
that assess a construct that is different from the
principal one being measured, that is, multidimen-
sionality. Understanding poor fit can lead to
improving or dropping items. A guide to interpret-
ing fit statistics can be found at http://www
.rasch.org/rmt/. The Rasch model provides two
indicators of misfit: infit and outfit for both per-
sons and items (Wright & Stone).
Person fit indicates the extent to which each per-
son's performance is consistent with the way items
are used by other respondents. Item fit indicates the
extent to which the use of a particular item is consis-
tent with the way sample respondents have answered
other items. For this type of analysis, values under
1.33 are considered acceptable (Smith, 2000;
Wilson, 2005). Low fit values, for example, <0.75
provide less motivation for item editing than do high
values (Wilson), and they do not disturb the mean-
ing of a measure though they may reduce precision
(Linacre & Wright, 1994). We also used statistical
significance (p < .05) as a criterion to examine items
that should be dropped. Person fit statistics were
examined to inform the clinical interpretation of the
person measures but no persons were dropped.
Rating Scale.--The proper functioning of the
rating scale was examined using: (a) fit statistics
where outfit mean squares should be <2.0, (b)
average measures advance monotonically with
each category, and (c) step calibrations increase
monotonically (Linacre, 1999, 2002; Zhu, 2002;
Zhu, Updike, & Lewandowski, 1997). We did not
expect the "suspected" category to perform as a
typical rating scale category. We expected it to be
used very rarely, but, based on qualitative input, it
was important to include. A "not applicable/don't
know" category was coded as missing data.
The results tables are modified from Winsteps
3.67 (Linacre, 2009) with annotated explanations
and interpretations. For an overview of Rasch
analysis, see Conrad and Smith (2004); for a com-
plete treatment, see Bond and Fox (2007); and
Rasch Measurement Transactions at http://www
.rasch.org/rmt/.
Construct Validation.--In Rasch analysis, the
item hierarchy that is created by the item difficulty
estimates provides an indication of construct valid-
ity (Smith, 2001). Items should form a ladder with
low severity symptoms on the bottom and high
severity symptoms on the top. In our prior work
developing the FE measure (Conrad et al., in press),
16 experts grouped the items into six categories
and rated the severity of the items on a scale from
1 to 5. These item severities were then averaged
within each category. The result was a theoretical
hierarchy of six conceptual components of FE
arranged in descending severity as follows (expert
rating in parentheses): Theft and scams (4.31),
financial victimization (4.20), financial entitlement
(4.04), coercion (3.92), signs of possible abuse
(3.27), and money management difficulties (1.94).
We tested whether the hierarchy developed by the
experts was validated compared with the client
ratings given by respondents in the present study
using the Rasch calibration on each item and aver-
aging those within each group of items.
Multitrait, Multimethod Analysis.--Construct
validation also may be tested by setting up a pat-
tern of theoretical expectations and testing whether
those expectations are supported by the data
(Campbell & Fiske, 1959). As Campbell and Fiske
pointed out, measures of the same construct should
be highly correlated especially if they use the same
method of observation.
Measures Used in Construct Validation.--The
IDoA uses a questionnaire for elder abuse investiga-
tions that covers many forms of elder abuse, includ-
ing FE. The IDoA form contains several sections
that ask investigators to circle specific indicators of
each type of suspected abuse. At the bottom of each
Vol. 50, No. 6, 2010 763
section, the staff member is asked to indicate if
abuse is substantiated. The form also asks investi-
gators for closing status on the case, identifying
which types of abuse are substantiated. We exam-
ined the correlation of this closing status substanti-
ation decision on FE with results from the OAFEM
questionnaires. The following coding was used:
1)  Client gender: men = 0, women = 1.
2) 
FE substantiation decision: we considered
FE substantiated if the staff member coded it
"verified" or "some indication." For cases marked
"no indication" or "unable to verify," FE was
considered not substantiated.
3) 
OAFEM staff: the staff reported OAFEM person
reliability on 227 clients reported by the 22 staff
was very high at 0.94 with a Cronbach's alpha
of 0.97. The Rasch item reliability was also very
high at 0.97. The final 82 items of staff-reported
FE (similar but not the same as the 79 client-
reported items) met stringent Rasch analysis fit
and unidimensionality criteria.
4) 
OAFEM client: details are described in the
Results section.
The direction and strength of construct pairs
depends on method and theoretical expectations. We
set up a pattern of expected correlations roughly cor-
responding to the guidelines of Cohen (1988, 1992)
as follows: NS = nonsignificant, <.1 = low, >.3 =
moderate, and >.5 = high. Others have suggested
lower values based on reviews of research, for
example, >.2 = moderate and >.3 = high (Hemphill,
2003), so there are no absolute guidelines avail-
able. This hypothesized pattern and resulting
correlations are in the upper right half of Table 4.
The diagonal entries are the person reliabilities.
The hypothesized correlations are stated above
each correlation coefficient and are bulleted below:
1) 
Client gender: we had no reason to expect
differential exploitation by gender so all gender
correlations were expected to be NS.
2)  FE substantiation decision:
·
· Moderate correlation with OAFEM and
·
· High correlation (because staff complete
both) with Older Adult Mistreatment
Assessment (OAMA) staff FE.
3)  OAMA staff FE:
·
· High correlation (because similar method
and questions) with OAFEM.
In the multitrait, multimethod analyses, the
most complete versions of OAMA measures were
used.
Results
Of all 227 clients who completed the OAFEM
self-report questionnaires via interview, 164 (72%)
had at least some indication of FE based on IDoA
"verification decision" criteria.
1. Test the fit of the items: items were dropped
because they did not meet criteria for fit, that
is, they had both infit and outfit >1.33, and/or
point measure correlation, <.2. Because this
was an iterative analysis, 3 of the original 82
items were dropped because they misfit, then
the analysis was rerun. The remaining 79 items
fit on the second and final run.
2. Test construct dimensionality: the variance
explained in the remaining 79 items was
44.3%. This large amount, beyond the 40%
criterion, was supportive of a strong principal
measurement dimension. Moreover, unidi-
mensionality was supported because the resid-
ual variance explained by the first contrast
was very small--7.0% indicating no substan-
tial rival dimension. The corresponding per-
centages for the measurement dimension and
first factor of residuals respectively were
42.3% and 7.7% for the 54-item version and
45.2% and 10% for the 30-item version. The
resulting correlations using the procedure of
Linacre (1998b) were .79, .78, and .78 for the
79-, 54- and 30-item forms respectively, that
is, strongly supportive of unidimensionality.
3. Assess internal consistency reliability using a
standard of .80: the Rasch person reliability
for the 79-item version was very high at 0.92
(alpha = 0.96). Similarly, Rasch item reliabil-
ity was very high at 0.95.
4. Develop short forms that would be user-
friendly for clinical applications: to test if a
more parsimonious model would also func-
tion well, we developed two shorter forms
containing 54 items and 30 items respectively
(Appendix contains items by form informa-
tion). Because both met stringent Rasch analy-
sis fit and unidimensionality criteria, we report
on the final 30-item instrument. The short
form is viewed as most useful, but the longer
forms provide a bank of items that may be
useful in future development of alternative
forms or computerized adaptive tests.
The Gerontologist
764
For the 54-item version, person reliability was
0.88 (alpha = 0.95). Rasch item reliability was
0.95. The Rasch person reliability for the 30-item
form remained high at 0.85 (corresponding to
Cronbach's alpha of 0.93). The Rasch item reli-
ability was also very high at 0.96.
5. Examine the appropriateness of the measure
for the target population: in Figure 1, the
Rasch ruler for the 30-item version is dis-
played. On the far left is the measurement scale
in logits ranging from -3 to +3. Persons (n =
227) are arrayed on the left of the dashed line
(representing the ruler) and the 30 items on the
right. By convention, the item mean is the 0 point
on the ruler. The items form a hierarchy of
severity based on frequency of endorsement
with lower severity items (more frequently
endorsed) at the bottom and higher severity
items (less frequently endorsed) at the top. The
persons are displayed according to their mea-
sures on the OAFEM scale with low scorers
(low FE) at the bottom and high scorers (high
FE) at the top. There is a substantial floor of
persons at the bottom who are not registering
any FE. This was expected because all staff
substantiated elder abuse clients were accepted,
whether or not they were substantiated specifi-
cally for FE. Although the persons in the floor
were included on the map, they were not
included in the calculation of the person mean
(M = -0.79 on the left side of the ruler) and
standard deviation (SD = 1.02). We interpreted
this as reasonably well targeted because the
person mean was within one logit and about
one item SD of the item mean of zero.
6. Test construct validity by positing a hierarchy
of concept rankings and a set of hypothesized
relationships: looking at Table 3, "Original
concept group," the ordering of the FE con-
ceptual components was the same in four out
of six cases for experts, averaging their con-
cept map ratings, and clients, averaging their
Rasch measurement calibrations. The first dif-
ference between experts and clients was coer-
cion that jumped in rank from fourth most
severe as rated by experts to second most
severe based on client endorsements. Clients
ranked abuse of trust fifth whereas experts
had ranked it second. However, these differ-
ences are negated by the fact that the model
SE was 0.36. Therefore, the differences in the
rankings were not statistically significantly
different among the four concepts in the mid-
dle of the expert hierarchy. Specifically, they
ranged from abuse of trust at -0.13 to signs of
possible abuse at -0.07 to financial entitle-
ment at -0.03 to coercion at 0.03. In other
words, using the client rankings, there was a
statistical four-way tie among the concepts for
second place.
Rasch results indicated that 79-, 54- and 30-item
versions formed a unidimensional overarching
measure of client-reported FE. Therefore, rather
than separating FE into several separate dimen-
sions, the Rasch results suggested a single hierarchy
that could be conceptualized according to its sever-
ity levels. The structure of the client data as seen in
the Wright map presented a simpler picture of FE
than the expert groups and ratings. Four groups
were identified consisting, in descending order of
severity, of major theft and scams (MT), lesser theft
and scams (LT), risk (dropped from the 30-item
form), and entitlement and expectations (EE).
Examination of the Wright map (Figure 1) indicates
these severity groups using the two-letter suffixes
above. These were similar to the experts' concept
groups except that signs and risk factors were
excluded from the short forms because they do not
connote actual exploitation, and the coercion items
were incorporated into the other groups because
they were dispersed throughout the hierarchy. The
validity of these groups is supported because, on
average, they are located over one SE (SE = 0.36)
from each other, that is, average item calibrations
for MT = 0.48, LT = -0.20, and EE = -0.58. We
can see that MT and EE are nearly 3 SEs apart.
Regarding correlational validation, we hypoth-
esized that all gender correlations would be NS
and they were (Table 4). The other three correla-
tions, two high and one moderate, were as hypoth-
esized that was supportive of the OAFEM's
validity.
7. Identify an appropriate cutoff to determine
FE: because there is no solely empirical way to
determine a cut-point, we discuss the logic of
our cut-points below.
Discussion
This study used Rasch item response theory and
traditional validation approaches to examine the psy-
chometric properties of the OAFEM. Previous work
with expert-developed concept maps of FE, focus
groups,andcognitiveinterviewsresultedinan82-item
Vol. 50, No. 6, 2010 765
questionnaire administered in the present study by
APS staff (n = 22) to substantiated clients (n = 227) in
seven agencies in Illinois. Because no distinct empiri-
cally validated measure of FE exists, the OAFEM
offers an important tool for elder abuse research as
well as to practitioners working in the field.
The OAFEM met stringent Rasch model criteria
for item fit and unidimensionality; it had high internal

consistency and item reliability. As a unidimen-
sional measure of FE, it was found to have levels of
severity rather than distinct subdimensions. These
ranged from major theft at the high end to lesser
theft in the middle to expectations and entitlement
at the low end. This severity hierarchy helps us to
develop a suggested cutoff score, though it is admit-
tedly speculative at this early stage.
If we look at Figure 1, the person­item map,
173 persons endorsed at least one item on the
30-item OAFEM. Note that above -1.0 on this
ruler, the item meanings and locations indicate
that this may be a useful cutoff score. In other
words, this level indicates more serious violations
such as "unexplained disappearances of the elder's
possessions" and "alleged abuser lying about
spending the elder's money." Above this -1.0 level
were 102 persons. These persons had a score of
12 or more of a possible 60 raw score points on
the measure. If we use a higher severity of 0 on the
ruler as the criterion for serious FE, there were
41 persons above this level having even more severe
symptomatology, that is, mostly major theft and
scams. These symptoms included "alleged abuser
forcing the older adult into signing legal docu-
ments" and "pressuring the older adult to modify
their will." Therefore, using cutoffs suggested by
the client-reported empirical hierarchy, there were
102 persons who reported clinically significant FE.
Of these, 41 were suffering from very severe FE.
Study Strengths and Limitations
This study developed the largest known data-
base of substantiated clients of elder abuse to test
the validity of the OAFEM and to suggest cut-
points for judgments of severity. Although it had
well-targeted clients, expert interviewers, and
modern measurement techniques, it was limited to
the small geographic area of Cook and surround-
ing counties in Illinois. Although several validity
tests were applied, many more can be imagined in
other areas and populations. The groups and cut-
points suggested here were based on the logic of
the Wright map hierarchy, but are otherwise spec-
ulative, and will require further replication and
validation with external criteria to refine them, for
example, using bank records and other financial
documents, and sensitivity­specificity analysis
once a cut-point is defined.
Conclusions
These measures, used appropriately as long and
short forms, should help to open the neglected area
of FE of older adults for improved services and

research. They should improve the understanding of
prevalence by offering researchers a tested approach
to the measurement of FE as well as enabling more
accurate self- and third-party reporting. Using the
Wright map, the measures provided theoretically
supportable gradations along the continuum of abuse
severity that can enable better decision making.
Improved measurement will also enable practitio-
ners to screen clients more efficiently, systemati-
cally, and precisely, so that, with the development of
cutoff scores, cases may be triaged more effectively
into appropriate interventions.
