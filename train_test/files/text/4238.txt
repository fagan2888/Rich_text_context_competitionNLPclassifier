Abstract
Objectives: To evaluate the effects of the timing of warfarin (WF) administration in patients with
gastric cancer who received S-1 oral chemotherapy.
Methods: This retrospective chart review collected patient data including the prothrombin time
international normalized ratio (PT-INR). Patients were categorized into three groups based on the
timing of WF administration in relation to S-1 oral chemotherapy: group A patients received WF
before S-1 chemotherapy; group B patients started WF during S-1 chemotherapy; and group C
patients started WF after completing S-1 chemotherapy.
Results: A total of 21 patients with gastric cancer were included in the study; group A
(n ¼ 8), group B (n ¼ 10) and group C (n ¼ 3). Seven patients (88%) in group A, seven (70%) in
group B and all of the patients (100%) in group C had >2.5 PT-INR. There was no significant
difference in the time-to-exceed 2.5 PT-INR between groups A and B.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that the timing of WF use in relation to S-1 chemotherapy
might not be an important factor for PT-INR, although the low patient numbers included in the
study should be taken into consideration.

Introduction
Cancer and its treatment with chemotherapy
are known to be important risk factors for
the development of a thromboembolism,
such as a venous thromboembolism, due to
an enhancement of blood clotting.1 Cancer
is defined as a risk factor for thromboembol-
ism in the guidelines for the diagnosis,

treatment and prevention of pulmonary
thromboembolism and deep vein throm-
bosis.2 Warfarin (WF) is one of the major
anticoagulants used for the treatment of
thromboembolism.3 The American Society
of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guide-
line for venous thromboembolism prophy-
laxis and treatment in patients with cancer
recommends WF for long-term treatment,
while also recommending at least 6 months
of WF.4
The S-1 combination of oral anticancer
agents, which is comprised of a molar ratio
of 1:0.4:1 of tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydrox-
ypyridine and potassium oxonate,5 is indi-
cated for various cancer types in Japan; for
example, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer,
non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck
cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and
biliary tract cancer.6 The cytochrome P-450
isoenzymes, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8,
CYP2C18, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, metab-
olize WF.7 CYP2C9 plays the main role in
WF metabolism and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
inhibits the hepatic metabolism of WF by
inhibiting the synthesis of CYP2C9.7 The
effects of drug interactions have been
reported for 5-FU, capecitabine and S-1.8
A prolonged prothrombin time was
observed in patients taking WF with a
fluoropyrimidine, such as S-1, due to drug­
drug interactions via CYP2C9.9 Therefore,
close monitoring of the prothrombin time
international normalized ratio (PT-INR) is
required to adjust the WF dose.10,11 Several
studies have reported a drug­drug inter-
action between fluoropyrimidines and WF
based on the effects on PT-INR.12­15 The
drug­drug interaction between S-1 and WF
has proven to be an especially difficult issue
for clinical practitioners in Japan due to the
broad range of indications for WF.16­18
A previous report from Japan demon-
strated that most of the patients using WF
who then started using S-1 oral chemother-
apy exceeded the upper limit of PT-INR,
with the period of the maximum PT-INR
being approximately 1 month.19 These data
were obtained only in patients who had used
WF before they commenced S-1 chemother-
apy, and no clinical data were available on
the timing of WF administration in relation
to starting S-1 oral chemotherapy and
the effect that timing had on PT-INR.19
Moreover, the previous study evaluated
patients with any type of cancer who had
already used WF and then started S-1 oral
chemotherapy, because the study only
wanted to evaluate the effects of S-1 oral
chemotherapy administration on WF ther-
apy.19 To eliminate the bias possibly asso-
ciated with evaluating different cancer types
and their various chemotherapy regimens,
this present study focused solely on patients
with gastric cancer, who form the majority
of cancer patients in Japan,6 who used both
WF and S-1. This study was designed to
evaluate the effects of the timing of WF
administration in relation to S-1 oral chemo-
therapy in patients with gastric cancer.
Patients and methods
Participants and study design
This study was conducted as a retrospective
chart review of patients with gastric cancer
who received WF and S-1. Patients were
identified from a computer-generated list
produced by the pharmacy database, which
is managed by the Division of Pharmacy,
National Cancer Center Hospital East,
Kashiwa, Japan, of patients treated for
gastric cancer between 1 January 2009 and
31 December 2013. Although all of the
patients had gastric cancer, the specific
reason for WF use and the S-1 chemother-
apy regimen used varied between patients.
According to clinical guidelines for deep
vein thrombosis,2 the baseline of INR is
defined as 2.5. The majority of patients used
WF for deep vein thrombosis, but there is
no standard baseline for WF PT-INR in
cancer patients, therefore, >2.5 PT-INR
was defined as a drug interaction event
1124 Journal of International Medical Research 44(5)
between S-1 and WF in this study. This
present study defined 2.5 PT-INR as the
upper limit of the laboratory data for an
adequate anticoagulant effect. Subject-
specific information, such as age, sex,
chemotherapy regimen, initial PT-INR, pur-
pose of WF use and initial WF dose was
collected from electronic medical databases.
The adverse events due to WF were evaluated
by oncologists according to the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
version 4.0.20
The study endpoints were: (i) the incidence
of excess 2.5 PT-INR; (ii) the time-to-exceed
2.5 PT-INR; (iii) the time-to-maximum
PT-INR; and (iv) adverse drug reactions to
WF. To analyse the differences due to the
timing of WF administration for S-1 oral
chemotherapy, the patients were categorized
into three groups based on the WF adminis-
tration timing in relation to S-1 oral chemo-
therapy; group A comprised of patients who
had already received WF before S-1 chemo-
therapy; group B comprised of patients who
started WF during S-1 chemotherapy; and
group C comprised of patients who started
WF after finishing S-1 chemotherapy.
The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the National
Cancer Center Hospital East (approval
number: 2013-313). As this was a retrospect-
ive chart review study, the need to obtain
informed patient consent was waived.
Chemotherapy regimens
All patients received a chemotherapy regi-
men that was registered with the Division of
Pharmacy, National Cancer Center Hospital
East and generated by a computerized pro-
vider order entry (CPOE) system. The val-
idity of the chemotherapy regimen that was
selected by the CPOE system was evaluated
by the Division of Pharmacy. After the
review process, the Division of Pharmacy
built the protocol into the order template in
the CPOE system. After the template was
approved, the oncologist only needed to
choose the name of the regimen to order
the chemotherapy on each patient's elec-
tronic medical record. The CPOE utilized
weight and height to calculate the dose of the
components of the chemotherapy regimen
and the template provided the administra-
tion sequence for the anticancer agents,
along with any supportive medicines and
hydration that the oncologist had authorized
for the specific protocol. Therefore, all
patients who had a given chemotherapy
regimen had essentially the same treatment.
This study evaluated patients who received
any one of the following three chemotherapy
regimens: S-1 monotherapy,21 S-1þcisplatin
(CDDP) chemotherapy22 and docetaxel
(DOC)þCDDP þ S-1 chemotherapy.23
PT-INR measurements
Due to the retrospective nature of this
analysis, it was not possible to control the
frequency and timing of the blood sampling.
The PT-INR testing frequency was based on
the chemotherapy cycle that was used. S-1
monotherapy was normally performed in
an outpatient setting, so the PT-INR test
was performed at each outpatient clinic visit.
The outpatient examination was performed
once weekly at first, and after the estab-
lishment of a stable PT-INR, the exam-
ination changed to either biweekly or
monthly. The S-1 þ CDDP chemotherapy
and DOC þ CDDP þ S-1 chemotherapy
regimens were performed in an inpatient
setting, but after discharge from hospital,
oncologists closely monitored the patients
and examined the PT-INR on a weekly or
biweekly basis. To evaluate and compare
any potential drug­drug interactions
between S-1 and WF, the mean PT-INR
for the time-to-exceed 2.5 PT-INR for the
first time and the mean PT-INR for the time-
to-maximum PT-INR were determined.
Routine venous blood samples were
taken in order to determine haematological
Suzuki et al. 1125
parameters such as white and red blood cell
counts. PT-INR was measured using a
ThromborelÕ S Kit (Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany) and a
Sysmex CA-1500Õ System (Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics) following the
manufacturer's instructions. PT-INR was
measured within 24 h of blood collection.
In brief, venous blood (9 parts) was carefully
mixed with 1 part sodium citrate solution
(0.11 mol/l), avoiding the formation of a
foam. The blood specimen was centrifuged
at 1500 g for !15 min at room temperature
and then stored at room temperature to
prevent cold activation of Factor VII. The
citrated plasma (100 ml) was incubated for
1 min at 37C in a test tube prewarmed
to 37C. Then 200 ml of ThromborelÕ S
Reagent prewarmed to 37C was added to
the plasma and the Sysmex CA-1500Õ
System was used to determine the coagula-
tion time.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 22.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Bivariate analysis, Mann­
Whitney U-test or log-rank test were used
to examine the time-to-events due to a drug­
drug interaction between S-1 and WF.
Fisher's exact probability test was used for
categorical variables. A P-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
This retrospective chart review identified 21
patients with gastric cancer who were
administered WF and S-1. There were
eight patients in group A, 10 in group B
and three in group C. Table 1 presents the
demographic and clinical characteristics of
the study participants. There were no sig-
nificant differences in the median age, sex
distribution or initial PT-INR between the
three groups (Mann­Whitney U-test and
Fisher's exact probability test). The most
common chemotherapy regimen was S-1
monotherapy, while group B had five
patients who had the S-1 þ CDDP regimen.
Patients used WF for a variety of indica-
tions, but the most frequent reasons were to
prevent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary
embolism due to cancer and chemotherapy
treatment. There were no significant differ-
ences in the initial WF dose used between
the three groups (Mann­Whitney U-test).
Seven of eight patients (88%) in group A,
seven of 10 patients (70%) in group B and all
of the patients (100%) in group C had >2.5
PT-INR (Table 2). There was no significant
difference in the mean time-to-exceed 2.5
PT-INR between groups A and group B
(log-rank test). The median time-to-exceed
2.5 PT-INR was also not significantly dif-
ferent between groups A and group B (log-
rank test) (Figure 1). In group C, all three
patients exceeded 2.5 PT-INR after using
WF, even though they had already finished
their S-1 chemotherapy. The times from the
last S-1 administration to WF administra-
tion were 21, 24 and 26 days, respectively.
There was no significant difference in the
mean time-to-maximum PT-INR between
groups A and group B (log-rank test)
(Table 2).
In terms of drug reactions to WF, there
were two patients who experienced bleeding
in group A; and the time-to-bleeding was 41
days and 119 days, respectively. In group B,
five patients underwent heparinization
before switching to oral WF. No patients
experienced bleeding in groups B or C.
Discussion
From the PT-INR results obtained in this
present study, the timing of WF administra-
tion appeared not to be a significant factor
in the drug­drug interactions between WF
and S-1, a fluoropyrimidine-based com-
bination of oral chemotherapy agents.

However, it should be noted that the patient
numbers in this present study were low and
should be taken into consideration when
drawing any conclusions. There have been
several reports that have examined the inci-
dence of drug interactions between S-1 and
WF and the time-to-exceed the therapeutic
range of PT-INR due to an S-1 drug inter-
action.16­18 The mean time-to-exceed the
upper limit of PT-INR was approximately
1 month.16­18 The results in this present
study, as well as those of other studies,16­18
show that neither the initial PT-INR nor the
initial dose of WF were important factors in
the drug­drug interaction between S-1 and
WF. A metabolite of S-1, 5-FU, diminishes
CYP2C9, so the concurrent use of S-1 and
WF results in a delay of WF metabolism.7
The adverse drug reaction of bleeding due
to WF use was observed in two patients in
group A. It was difficult to manage this
drug­drug interaction. None of the patients

in group B experienced bleeding, but half of
them had undergone heparinization before
WF oral anticoagulation therapy. The hep-
arin and WF treatments were carefully
administered, so bleeding did not occur in
group B. It was noted in the two patients in
group A that the time-to-bleeding was not
similar, occurring on days 41 and 119, which
suggests that it will be extremely difficult to
predict this type of adverse drug reaction.
In group C, all three patients exceeded 2.5
PT-INR after they started WF following
completion of their S-1 chemotherapy. The
times from the last S-1 administration to
WF administration were 21, 24 and 26 days,
respectively. The half-life of WF ranges
from 55 to 133 h and its pharmacological
mechanism of action is via the inhibition of
vitamin K epoxide reductase and suppres-
sion of the blood clotting factors II, VII, IX
and X.7 Even though there was almost a
1-month wash-out period for S-1, the drug
interactive effect appeared to persist in
group C.
This retrospective chart review study had
a number of limitations. First, it was limited
to a specific chemotherapeutic regimen and
only included Japanese patients with gastric
cancer. Secondly, even though most of the
patients had the PT-INR test weekly or
biweekly after the concurrent use of WF
and S-1, the PT-INR test was not measured
within the same period due to the retrospect-
ive nature of the study. Thirdly, the study
only evaluated 21 patients with gastric
cancer who concomitantly used WF and
S-1 for the period of the study. The patient
numbers were limited because, in an attempt
to eliminate bias, the study focused on
patients with gastric cancer and their treat-
ment with S-1-based chemotherapy regi-
mens. Gastric cancer was selected because
it is the most prevalent cancer in Japan. Even
though the number of patients was limited, it
was worthwhile evaluating this study popu-
lation because of its rarity. However, the
number of patients might have been insuffi-
cient to evaluate the differences due to the
timing of WF administration in relation to
S-1 chemotherapy use. Further studies to
evaluate the effects of the timing of WF
and S-1 use in patients with cancer are
needed.
In conclusion, to the best of our know-
ledge, this retrospective chart review study is
the first report to show that the timing of
WF administration does not appear to be a
significant factor in the drug­drug inter-
action that takes place between S-1, a
fluoropyrimidine-based oral combination,
and WF, although the low patient numbers
included in the study should be taken into
consideration. There were two cases of
bleeding in group A, but these did not
occur in the initial phase of WF administra-
tion. Therefore, the potential for an adverse
drug reaction remains a concern during the
whole period of the concomitant use of WF
and S-1.
