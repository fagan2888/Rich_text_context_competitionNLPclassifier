We supplement earlier published findings on the academic
achievement of the immigrant second generation with an analysis
of school contextual effects based on the same large data set used
by the best-known prior analyses, the Children of Immigrants
Longitudinal Study. A hierarchical model of contextual and indi-
vidual-level effects on academic achievement and school attrition
reveals patterns that reproduce those found in national student
surveys but also others that are unique to the second generation.
Among the latter are the resilient negative effect of length of U.S.
residence on achievement across school contexts and the fact that
strong effects of national origin on grades are attenuated in
schools with high proportions of coethnics. Mexican-origin stu-
dents display significant disadvantages in achievement and reten-
tion that are generally compounded, not alleviated, by the schools
that they attend. A theoretical explanation of this pattern is
advanced, and its practical implications are discussed.
The rapid growth of immigration during the past three decades
has transformed the demographic structure of the United
States and the nature of its interethnic relations. During the past
intercensal period, immigration accounted for 70% of the
growth of the American population; the foreign-born population
reached 30 million, approaching the historic record of 15% of the
total population attained in the 1920s. By 1997, a remarkable
62% of the population of Los Angeles was of immigrant stock
(first or second generation) as were 54% of New York's, 43% of
San Diego's, and 72% of Miami's population (1, 2).
Although the initial attention of scholars and policy makers
focused on the immigrants themselves, it has become clear over
time that the long-term consequences of today's immigrant wave
are more closely linked with the second generation and its chances
for successful adaptation. Immigrant children and U.S.-born chil-
dren of immigrants are the fastest growing segment of the nation's
population under 18 years of age. By 2000, they approached 15
million or 1 in 5 of all young Americans (3, 4).
Unlike first-generation immigrants whose concerns and aspira-
tions are commonly centered in their country of origin and who
frequently return there, the second generation is composed of U.S.
citizens and most of its members are here to stay (5, 6). Most of this
population is still young and the majority are still in school (4, 7).
Hence, the principal outcomes of the adaptation process at this
stage are educational: academic attainment and the likelihood of
graduating vs. dropping out of high school. In this article, we
examine the effects of the class and ethnic composition of the
schools that second-generation youths attend in early adolescence
on these key outcomes.
Using data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study
(CILS), the most extensive data source on the immigrant second
generation to date, Portes and Rumbaut (8) analyzed the educa-
tional adaptation process of this population. Results were published
in a series of articles and in a recent book, Legacies: The Story of the
Immigrant Second Generation. The main findings from their analysis
will be summarized below. However, potential effects of school
contextual variables on academic achievement and school retention
were not examined exhaustively. The purpose of the present article
is to extend and supplement these prior results by applying more
advanced and appropriate statistical methods to the CILS data set.
The longitudinal character of the study makes it possible to examine
how school compositional factors at an early age can bear on
subsequent academic achievement and on the likelihood of second-
generation youths remaining in school until graduation. Specifi-
cally, we inquire about the effects of the class and ethnic compo-
sition of schools attended in early adolescence on the probability of
graduation and on level of educational attainment.
Theoretical Background
At least since the famous Coleman Report, the preoccupation
has continued among education scholars with the ways in which
school context affects the academic performance of children,
both directly and in interaction with individual predictors (9­12,
§). The abundant literature about this topic has paid particular
attention to the differential performance of students in Catholic
and other private schools, as contrasted with those in lay public
schools (10, 13­15).
Educational researchers have identified school composition as
one of the key areas responsible for schools' differences in overall
academic success and rates of dropout (16). School compositional
effects constitute the aggregate influence of school peers on a
student's school experience, above and beyond the effects of the
individual student's own particular peers (17­19). When schools are
segregated by their socioeconomic status (SES), they differ in many
ways, including teacher quality, staffing ratios, school climate, and
teachers' expectations (20). Previous research has found a school's
mean SES to have a contextual effect on students' achievement and
dropout rates, over and beyond the effects of individual students'
background characteristics (20­25).
Many minority schools are of low SES, which is a major reason
why minority schools are associated with low achievement. How-
ever, recent studies show an influence of ethnic segregation on
academic achievement independent of the school's SES (26). And,
despite 20 years of desegregation efforts, U.S. public schools have
increasingly resegregated (27). School segregation is most pro-
nounced in large metropolitan areas where immigrants are con-
centrated. During the period from 1989 to 1995, the between-
district segregation in metropolitan areas steadily increased (28).
School segregation among Hispanics has become substantially

more pronounced than among other minority groups, including
Black Americans, and Hispanic school segregation grew substan-
tially faster than that of other minority groups (29). Few studies so
far have focused, however, on the long-term consequences that
early class and ethnic composition of schools can have on subse-
quent educational outcomes.
The sociology of immigration and, in particular, the study of the
second generation, has made several significant empirical contri-
butions, indicating that the growing population of children of
immigrants is similar to the general student population in some
respects, but it also differs in systematic ways. These analyses,
including those performed on the basis of CILS data, show positive
effects of family status, student ambition, self-esteem, and gender
(female) on achievement. They also point to the very strong effect
of intact families on school retention and significant positive
influences of coethnic friendships and fluent bilingualism on aca-
demic attainment (30­35). In addition, resilient ethnic effects
associated with students' national origins persist after controlling
for all individual and family variables. These effects have been
interpreted as supporting the enduring influence of coethnic com-
munities and the intergenerational transmission of advantage and
disadvantage associated with the modes of incorporation of differ-
ent immigrant groups (30, 36, 37).
We hypothesize that the socioeconomic and ethnic composition
of schools attended early in life can have enduring consequences on
chances for educational success of immigrant children. Based on the
existing research literature, we predict that the average SES of
schools attended in early adolescence will be positively associated
with educational performance and negatively associated with drop-
ping out among second-generation youths (10, 11). On the other
hand, the ethnic composition of schools can play an equally
enduring but different role. Although family and school SES
reinforce each other's effects, attending schools populated mostly
by coethnics may attenuate individual nationality effects. Several
recent studies suggest that children from underprivileged back-
grounds may feel at less of a disadvantage in the company of their
peers, and they would perform worse than expected in the com-
petitive environment of majority white middle-class schools¶
(38­40).
By the same reasoning, children from advantaged immigrant
nationalities who attend schools with a large number of similar
coethnics may see their academic gains attenuated by the more
competitive environment of such schools and the diminished sense
that they are, in some sense, ``special'' (41, 42). Although tentative
at this point, these ideas will serve as guide points for the explo-
ration of a question not analyzed before, namely, how early school
ethnic composition bears on the subsequent academic fate of the
new second generation.
Data and Prior Results
CILS is a survey of 5,266 children of immigrants who were
originally interviewed during school year 1992­1993 in the
school systems of Miami (Dade County) and Ft. Lauderdale
(Broward County) in Florida and San Diego in California. The
sample was limited to eighth and ninth graders to control for the
well known censoring bias created by school dropouts in later
grades. The ninth- to twelfth-grade dropout rate in Dade County
(Miami) and San Diego schools at the time of the CILS surveys
exceeded 15%. Among minority students, the dropout rates went
as high as 25% (see ref. 8, p. 259).] Second-generation students
were defined, in agreement with common usage in the immi-
gration literature, as native-born children with at least one
foreign-born parent or foreign-born children who were brought
to the United States at an early age and have resided in the
United States ever since.
The sample design was based on a selection of schools in each
area that represented different socioeconomic levels, ethnic com-
positions, and geographic locations. In total, 42 schools in the three
metropolitan areas took part in the study. In all, 77 different
nationalities are represented in the study. MiamiFt. Lauderdale
and San Diego were selected because of the different compositions
of their immigrant populations. South Florida is home to large
concentrations of people from the Caribbean and South America,
including Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, West Indians, and Co-
lombians. Southern California, in turn, has large concentrations of
Mexicans, Central Americans, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and East
Asians.
Three years after the original survey and at the time when most
respondents were in their senior year of high school, a follow-up was
conducted. Its purpose was to examine the evolution of key
adaptation outcomes during adolescence. Survey data were sup-
plemented by data provided by school systems on school inactivity
and senior high school grades. These records are the data used as
dependent variables in the following analysis.
The follow-up survey retrieved 82% of the original sample.
Sampling bias analysis, reported in earlier publications, indicates
that the second survey is representative, in almost every respect, of
the original sample (8). In addition, however, data on school
attrition and academic grades were provided by the schools them-
selves and are available for most original respondents, including
those not re-interviewed in the follow-up. Therefore, the data allow
us to examine the effects of individual, family, and school predic-
tors, measured during early adolescence, on academic outcomes 3
years later.
Several prior studies have analyzed different aspects of educa-
tional attainment in this sample. These studies have relied on
standard models of status attainment in sociology and economics
that highlight the significance of parental SES, family composition,
aspirations, and gender on student's academic performance§ (43­
45). In the only multilevel study of contextual effects on the
performance of the second generation published so far, Portes and
MacLeod (38) found that children from relatively advantaged
ethnic communities, such as Cubans in Miami and the Vietnamese
in San Diego, performed well academically, regardless of the
composition of the schools that they attended. In contrast, disad-
vantaged students, such as Mexican Americans in California and
Haitian Americans in Florida, performed differently depending on
school context. In agreement with results based on prior national
samples, this study found that family and school SES supported
each other so that the academic advantage of children from
high-status families was compounded in high-status schools.
Results published in Legacies (8) focused on academic outcomes
by the senior year of high school. The analysis found that, in
addition to the positive effects of family SES and intact families on
grade point averages (GPAs), early educational aspirations and
self-esteem also yielded strong positive effects. In contrast, length
of U.S. residence reduced grades in late adolescence, pointing to a
declining achievement drive among more assimilated second-
generation youths.
The same analysis modeled determinants of school attrition.
Living in an intact family (both parents present) proved a para-
mount factor in keeping children in school; early educational
expectations and self-esteem also prevented second-generation
youths from dropping out. Most ethnic effects disappeared after
controlling for individual and family variables, with one important
exception: Mexican-origin children continued to have a significantly
higher probability of abandoning school prematurely. We inquire in
the following analysis on how these results are affected by contex-
tual characteristics that have not been examined in prior analyses.

Results
Table 1 presents results of an individual-level ordinary least-
squares regression of GPAs in senior high school and of a
multinomial logistic regression of the probabilities of dropping
out or being declared inactive by the school system. The model
includes predictors derived from the previous theoretical review
and found to have statistically significant effects in all previous
analyses. Because our purpose is to examine possible interaction
effects between school contextual factors and individual-level
predictors of educational attainment, it is appropriate to limit
the level I models to predictors found to have statistically reliable
effects. Results in Table 1 provide a baseline for our analysis as
they replicate those reported by prior studies.
The analysis of national differences is limited to just four
nationalities: Chinese, Koreans, Mexicans, and Vietnamese. This
decision was based on the prior finding that these are the nation-
alities that have the strongest and most resilient effects on academic
performance and that these effects are of opposite sign: the three
Asian groups perform consistently above the sample average and
retain significant positive effects after controlling for other predic-
tors; the opposite is the case for Mexican-origin students (8).
Chinese and Korean students are combined in this analysis because
of their relatively small numbers and because of their close simi-
larity in terms of parental human capital, proportions living in intact
families, areas of residence, and levels of academic performance.
This reproduces past practice in the analysis of the same data (8).
The reference category for the analysis of national differences is
the remainder of the CILS sample comprising 73 different national-
origin groups and 3,000 cases. Because Mexican scores and those
of the three Asian nationalities balance each other on the depen-
dent variables, the averages for this reference category are very
close to those of the total sample. This finding makes this category
an appropriate point of comparison, equivalent to contrasting
Mexican- and Asian-origin students with the rest of the second
generation.
The dependent variables are GPA in senior high school and
indicators of dropping out and inactivity reported by the respective
school systems. We explicitly control for differences in grading
practices across regions by introducing this variable into the model
as a predictor. [This predictor is a dummy variable with schools in
California (San Diego) coded 1; those in Florida (MiamiFt.
Lauderdale) are coded 0.] The rest of results in the table reproduce
those reported earlier. They add to our confidence in GPA as a valid
indicator of academic performance by showing that it is a well
behaved measure that correlates positively and significantly with
established predictors of academic attainment: parental SES and
intact families have strong positive effects, as do self-esteem and
educational expectations. Females display significantly higher
achievements, a result that reproduces those reported in national
samples (38). As noted earlier, length of U.S. residence tends to
have a negative effect on second-generation grades.
The school systems of MiamiFt. Lauderdale and San Diego
provided two indicators of school abandonment, classifying some
students as ``dropouts'' and others as ``inactive.'' The first category
includes students who have been officially determined to have left
school before graduation and the second includes students whose
whereabouts are unknown. (The two categories are mutually ex-
clusive so that dropouts are not counted twice.) Table 1 shows a
similar pattern of effects on both indicators. It reproduces prior
published results showing the positive effects of intact families and
early educational expectations in preventing school abandonment
and the negative ones of age and Mexican origin. We inquire next
how these results vary with the characteristics of the schools that
second-generation youths attended in early adolescence.
Fixed and Random Effects. Table 2 presents results of an ANOVA
for random effects where the intercepts and all significant individ-
ual effects are modeled as a function of their respective grand
means plus an error term. This analysis is necessary to determine
whether sufficient between-school variance exists to justify multi-
level contextual modeling. The absence of such variance represents
a substantive outcome insofar as it indicates that a specific indi-
vidual or family effect persists, regardless of school context. By
having predictors coded as deviations from their school means, the

intercepts are equivalent, respectively, to the average within-school
GPA and the average log-odds of dropping out or becoming
inactive in school.
For this analysis, we combined Vietnamese and ChineseKorean
students into a single category. A good operational reason for this
decision exists, namely, the need for a large enough sample to
permit reliable estimation of contextual effects. However, there are
also substantive facts that make this approach reasonable. The three
Asian groups are quite similar in a number of characteristics. These
characteristics include the proportion living in intact families, very
high for all three groups; the high educational expectations among
both parents and children; and the three groups' higher-than-
average levels of academic performance. As shown in Table 1, both
ChineseKoreans and Vietnamese retain significant positive ethnic
effects on grades after controlling for all other factors, but neither
group has a significant net effect on dropping out or becoming
inactive in school.
Results presented in Table 2 use robust estimates of standard
errors to correct for the two-stage CILS sampling design. Robust
standard errors also attenuate the effect of a large sample size,
reducing the probability of a type I error. Results for the intercepts
show sufficient between-school variance in all dependent variables
to justify additional analysis. (To prevent an excessive loss of
schools, the analysis of contextual effects on all predictors, except
national origin, was performed with the latter kept as fixed effects.)
The same is not the case for the slopes. Among predictors of senior
high school grades, average effects of length of U.S. residence and
self-esteem do not vary significantly across schools. Substantively,
this means that, regardless of school context, individual self-esteem
is associated with higher academic performance, whereas accultur-
ation (indexed by longer periods of U.S. residence) depresses it. The
two ethnic effects, Mexican and Asian, remain highly significant,
albeit in opposite directions and both vary sufficiently to justify
further analysis.
Among the few significant predictors of dropping out, only the
age effect varies across schools. Although total variation in the
Mexican effect on dropping out is nonsignificant, it is possible that
some unobserved variation still exists. Given the theoretical im-
portance of this coefficient, we will examine this possibility. The
absence of sufficient observed and unobserved variation in other
significant predictors means that the strong effects of intact fami-
lies, early educational expectations, and self-esteem in preventing
school abandonment persist across different types of schools. This
result is substantively important. Self-esteem emerges from this
analysis as one of the strongest predictors of educational outcomes
among second-generation youths, having a significant positive
influence on grades and a negative one on dropping out, both
resilient to school compositional differences. Prior analyses of the
same data show that the positive effect of self-esteem on senior high
school achievement remains even after controlling for junior
grades, a finding that supports the hypotheses of a causal relation-
ship (8).
Growing up in an intact family turns out to be the most important
family factor because (unlike family SES) it has strong effects on
both grades and the probability of high school graduation, with the
latter effect invariant across schools of different characteristics. The
effects of early educational expectations run in the same direction,
reinforcing those of family composition and self-esteem.
Grades. The hierarchical analysis of school contextual effects mod-
els the intercepts of individual (level I) regressions and slopes for
which significant variance occurs as outcomes of three school
characteristics: (i) socioeconomic composition, indexed by the
obverse of the percentage of students eligible for the federally
subsidized lunch program; (ii) ethnic composition, indexed by the
percentage of students in school who are either Asian or Hispanic;
(iii) other school characteristics, captured by the contextual (level
II) error. The latter is interpretable as the sum of all other
(unmeasured) school characteristics affecting each level I outcome.
A control for region in the regressions of the between-school
intercepts obviates the need to include the same predictor in the
regressions of the slopes.
School compositional effects on grades are presented in Table 3.
SES of schools significantly improves academic achievement, a
result that reproduces the results found in past studies of national
samples (11, 14). The figure corresponds to the common-sense
notion that schools attended by high-status students tend to be
better overall, especially in terms of their academic outputs. (It is
also possible that higher-SES schools tend to give higher grades to
their students. Although we interpret GPAs in this analysis as a valid
overall indicator of academic achievement based on its correlations
with earlier test scores and other established predictors, the pos-
sibility that its variation between schools reflects, at least partially,
different grading practices cannot be discarded.) Turning to the

slopes, we note that no significant contextual influences on age
occur, but an important one occurs on gender to the effect that
second-generation females perform significantly better than males
and they do even better in schools with a higher proportion of Asian
students.
The strong influence of family SES background on academic
achievement is significantly reinforced in high-status schools, com-
pounding the advantages of children from well-to-do families. This
interaction of family and school contexts is identical with that
observed in national samples, indicating that immigrant youths are
no different from their native-born counterparts in the intergen-
erational transmission of privilege. However, when high-SES stu-
dents attend heavily Asian schools, the influence of their family
background is partially neutralized. The contextual effect of school
Asian composition is significant only at the 0.10 level, but it is of a
sufficient order of magnitude to attenuate the mutually reinforcing
influences of family and school SES. This effect is similar to the
``leveling'' influence that Catholic schools have on children of
different socioeconomic backgrounds, which has been observed in
national student samples (11, 13, 15, 46).
Fig. 1 helps illustrate the changing effects of family status in
schools of different socioeconomic levels. It graphically portrays the
compounding effects of social class in increasing achievement
inequalities. Schools of very-low-average status neutralize the pos-
itive influence of parental SES, leading to a slightly downward slope
in performance. The positive interaction between family and school
SES is most visible in high-status schools where the advantages
brought to school by privileged children truly pay off. (Again, it is
possible that the academic advantage of students from high-SES
families who attend high-SES schools may partially derive from the
tendency of these schools to grade their privileged students more
generously. Investigating this possibility would require an in-depth,
possibly ethnographic investigation into the grading practices of
different types of schools.)
As noted previously, intact families exercise a positive effect on
achievement regardless of school context, a result that highlights
once again the powerful influence of this variable on second-
generation achievement. The effect of early educational expecta-
tions does vary, however, with the class composition of schools. As
with family and school SES, these effects are mutually reinforcing
so that early ambition has a higher academic yield in high-status
schools, whereas its positive influence is weakened in poorer ones.
This interaction effect is quite similar to that portrayed in Fig. 1.
Therefore, two key interactions discovered by this analysis point to
the mutually reinforcing influence of high family SES and educa-
tional ambition for students whose school peers come from equally
privileged backgrounds. This result clearly supports our first hy-
pothesis concerning class compositional effects.
Next, we seek to establish whether the effects of national origin
vary with the proportion of coethnics in school. The central finding
in Table 3 is that individual ethnic effects, positive for Asians and
negative for Mexicans, are attenuated in the presence of a sizable
percentage of coethnics. Fig. 2 illustrates this pattern for Asian
students. The average percentage of Asians in our school sample is

19%, ranging from 0% to 45%. For schools at the low end of this
continuum, the average senior GPA for an Asian-origin student is
3.22, or 30% above the sample average. For Asian students who
attended more coethnic schools, the average grade drops to 2.77,
still above the grand mean but only by 12%.
In the Mexican students, the negative effect of ethnic origin is
also significantly attenuated in schools with higher numbers of
Hispanics. This effect reproduces that found by Portes and Ma-
cLeod (38) in their analysis of math scores in junior high school.
These authors interpreted it as indicating that Mexican students do
better in the more congenial and presumably less competitive
environment created by coethnic peers.
This line of reasoning corresponds to our second hypothesis
concerning the diminished effects of national and class origins in
the presence of a significant number of peers from the same ethnic
background. This attenuation applies to advantaged and disadvan-
taged immigrants and is supported by the previously noted effect of
Percent Asian in flattening the family SESGPA slope. To see
whether this contextual effect replicates across other indicators of
academic achievement, we ran the same analysis with math scores
in junior high school as the dependent variable. Portes and
MacLeod (38) had already found a reduction of ethnic disadvan-
tage on math scores for Mexican-origin students. We tested
whether the same result applies to the significant advantage of
Asian-origin youths. In this case, the number of Vietnamese-origin
students is sufficiently large to allow us to test this effect for all Asian
students and for the Vietnamese alone.
Table 4 presents the findings that indicate again that the signif-
icant academic advantages associated with Asian or Vietnamese
origin diminish in school contexts characterized by a large propor-
tion of other Asian students. Math scores were measured in junior
high school at the same time as ethnic composition of schools. (The
Stanford standardized math test score was administered to all
students in the sample during the eighth grade. These data are used
in the analysis presented in Table 4. In senior high school, the test
became optional, thereby eliminating its value as an indicator of
achievement. This optionality is the reason why earlier analyses
focused exclusively on senior GPAs.) But the analysis in Table 3
used GPAs in senior high school as the dependent variable. These
results indicate that the contextual effects of ethnic composition,
like those of class composition, endure over time: second-
generation students who attended higher-SES schools in early
adolescence continued to receive higher grades later on; and the
handicaps or advantages that they brought from their respective
ethnic communities continued to be reduced if their early school
contexts were marked by a heavy coethnic presence.
Complementing the explanation advanced by Portes and
MacLeod (38) for the reduction of the Mexican disadvantage in
mostly Hispanic schools, we interpret results for Asian students in
Tables 3 and 4 as indicating that the greater competition in heavily
Asian schools and the presence of equally disciplined and motivated
peers reduces the relative advantage brought by these students from
home. In both cases, however, the reduction of the ethnic effect is
relative; although attenuated, it never entirely disappears. Corre-
sponding to our two original hypotheses, the compositional effects
of class and ethnicity work at cross-purposes in affecting the
educational attainment of the second generation. Although higher
school SES supports and reinforces the effects of family SES and
educational expectations, coethnicity of schools reduces the strong
net influence on attainment associated with different immigrant
backgrounds. Both interactions are resilient, enduring over time.
School Abandonment. The two indicators of school abandonment
refer, respectively, to students who were officially determined to
have left school before graduation and those whose whereabouts
were unknown. Despite this difference, the analysis of determinants
of both outcomes yields similar results, showing only a few predic-
tors to have reliable effects. These have been described previously.
What is new in this analysis is that, as shown in Table 2, most of these
effects vary little across school contexts. These include the strong
influence of intact families and of early educational expectations
and self-esteem.
Extending this analysis, Table 5 presents hierarchical generalized
linear models regressions of the intercepts of both indicators of
school abandonment and of the age slope for dropping out. Despite
limited between-school variance, we also regressed the Mexican-
origin individual effect to determine how it is influenced by
contextual factors. These coefficients come from a multinomial
logit model, and, hence, the intercepts represent the average
within-school log-odds of dropping out or being declared inactive

relative to those who remained active or graduated. The slopes
represent the net effects on these log-odds.
To make results interpretable, we transformed all significant
effects into probabilities. Table 5 thus shows that the average
probability of dropping out in schools in this sample is 0.058 and that
it is not affected by the ethnic composition of schools attended in
early adolescence. On the other hand, class composition does play
a significant role, reducing the probability by 1% for each 10%
increase in the average SES of schools. Note that family SES is not
itself a significant predictor of dropping out, so that the inhibiting
influence of social class on this variable is exclusively contextual.
Older students are more likely to drop out or be declared inactive.
Each additional year of age increases the probability of dropping
out by 1.5% in the average school. The hierarchical generalized
linear regression model also indicates a tendency for this effect to
become steeper in schools with a higher percentage of Hispanic
students. Results confirm that Mexican ethnic origin raises the
probability of dropping out and that it does so by a significant
margin, 5.5%, which almost doubles the sample average. An equally
important finding is that this probability increases in higher-status
schools. In other words, although for the average second-generation
student attendance at a high-SES school reduces the chances of
dropping out, for Mexican-origin children it raises it. This remark-
able effect is portrayed in Fig. 3, which presents the relationship
between dropout probabilities and class composition for the entire
CILS sample and for its Mexican component.
Although this last effect was not predicted, it is in line with the
rationale of our second hypothesis, that is, in higher-SES (and
presumably less ethnic) schools the tendency of Mexican-American
students to drop out is heightened. This implies a lower probability
of doing so in lower-SES (and presumably more ethnic) schools.
The double contextual effect of class composition (positive for most
students, but negative for Mexican Americans) highlights again the
deleterious effect of more competitive environments for immigrant
students coming from unusually disadvantaged backgrounds. These
results support, once again, those reported by Portes and MacLeod
in 1996 (38).
Summary
This article has sought to extend our knowledge of the academic
achievement of the immigrant second generation by focusing on the
long-term effects of class and ethnic composition of schools. We
find that many of the individual-level effects reported in the
literature are quite stable across different school contexts. Such
results include the positive association of self-esteem with GPAs
and high school graduation and the strong effects of growing up
with both biological parents and of early ambition on both educa-
tional outcomes.
Other results reproduce those found in national student samples.
These include the significant contextual effect of school SES in
improving grades and reducing the probability of dropping out. As
found in earlier studies, school-class-composition SES interacts
with family SES, compounding the already considerable advantages
of students from more privileged backgrounds. Children of immi-
grants are no different in this respect from the rest of the popula-
tion.
Results unique to the second generation include the notably
invariant effect of length of U.S. residence on achievement and the
distinct ways in which the influence of ethnic origins play across
schools. Longer periods of U.S. residence lower academic perfor-
mance, and they do so regardless of school context. This result
points to the influence of acculturation in bringing down the initial
achievement drive among immigrant youths to the level predomi-
nant among native-parentage students. The sizable negative cor-
relations between length of U.S. residence and school engagement
and hours of homework reported by prior studies lends further
support to this conclusion (8).
Children of Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese immigrants and
children of Mexican immigrants display well known and opposite
patterns of academic achievement. The present analysis sheds light
on what happens when coethnics constitute a large proportion of
school peers. We hypothesized a counterintuitive effect of ethnic
composition leading to a partial attenuation of individual ethnic
effects. The rationale for this hypothesis, drawing from recent
literature that points to the inhibiting effects of highly competitive
environments on disadvantaged students, is well supported by the
results. Thus, once individual ethnic effects on average grades
(positive for Asians and negative for Mexicans) are taken into
account, the presence of a greater number of coethnic acts primarily
as a leveling factor. Our inquiry into whether this leveling effect is
restricted to GPA as an indicator of academic achievement shows
that it is not; the same result is observable in math scores for both
ethnic groups, pointing to the robustness of this effect across
nationalities and over time.
Mexican-origin students suffer not only from lower achievement
levels, but also from a higher propensity to drop out of school. The
new finding in this analysis is that this propensity becomes greater
in high-SES schools, contrary to what happens to other students.
This result suggests that dropping out represents a ``solution'' for
students who confront more competitive school environments
where the handicaps associated with their own backgrounds be-
come highly visible, subjecting them to greater discrimination by
others (37, 47, 48). This last finding is, of course, in line with the
hypothesis of attenuation of individual ethnic effects in mostly
minority (and lower SES) schools.
Conclusions
Results from this study make clear that the class and ethnic
composition of schools attended by immigrant youths in early
adolescence make a difference and that they do so in non-
common sensical ways. If our findings hold, they will have
definite implications for policies seeking to improve the educa-
tional achievement of students from different class and ethnic
backgrounds. A significant issue in need of attention concerns
the interpretation of the consistent academic advantages of
students from certain immigrant origins, such as Asians, and the
inferior performance of others, such as Mexicans. ``Culturalist''
interpretations have been advanced pointing to the achievement
``ethos'' associated with a Confucian background and the lack of
such drive among groups steeped in a Catholic tradition (49, 50).
Such facile interpretations ignore the specific historical origins of
each immigrant group and the ways in which different contexts of
reception have affected the socioeconomic adaptation of first-
generation immigrants. Adult immigrants, who possess material
resources are themselves highly educated and have been well
received in the host society, are in a position to effectively support

students.

the education of their offspring. This is the path followed by Chinese
and Koreans, immigrants with high-average levels of education and
who, as legal immigrants, are entitled to the full protection of the
law. In the case of the Vietnamese, lower levels of education were
compensated by a still more favorable official reception. As refu-
gees from a communist regime, they were entitled to generous
governmental assistance (51, 52).
No such help has been received by Mexican immigrants who have
the lowest average levels of education and occupational skills of any
sizable immigrant group in the United States and who experience,
in addition, a negative reception by the host society and govern-
ment. The low levels of human capital among Mexicans are not a
consequence of extraordinarily poor education in their country of
origin, but of its geographical proximity to the United States. Other
less developed countries have lower average educational levels than
Mexico but do not share a 2,000-mile border with the richest
country in the world. This geographical accident has enabled tens
of thousands of Mexican peasants and unskilled workers to migrate
by land in search of manual jobs (53­55).
The presence of so many poor and poorly educated Mexican
migrants reinforces already strong stereotypes in the American
population and contributes to a highly negative reception. Govern-
ment authorities regard Mexicans as potentially illegal entrants and
treat them accordingly. The general public perceives them as part
of a ``Third World invasion'' by the poor and downtrodden from
other lands (50). Simultaneously, and despite these stereotypes,
Mexican laborers continue to be in high demand in agribusiness, the
construction industry, personal services, and other labor-intensive
sectors.
Poor and poorly educated migrant workers congregate in tran-
sient and discriminated communities that cannot muster the min-
imum material and social resources to foster the economic progress
of their own members, much less provide for the educational
success of their offspring. Mexican youths bring to school a com-
mon experience of poverty and a lack of knowledge of the means
and the importance of succeeding educationally. The consistent
negative ``Mexican'' coefficient in our own study and in previous
analyses of academic attainment directly reflects these realities.
Despite such handicaps, the majority of Mexican-American
students still manage to graduate from high school and a minority
even moves up to college. That achievement, which reflects the
resilience of individual determination despite adverse external
circumstances, should not lead us to forget that differences among
first-generation immigrants in human capital and contexts of re-
ception cumulate over time, leading to large subsequent inequali-
ties. Should American society wish to achieve a minimum level of
equality among its newest citizens, measures are urgently needed to
build family and community resources capable of supporting the
education of the young.
Schools, especially the inner-city schools that disadvantaged
minorities attend, will not accomplish this task. The key lies in the
family and community institutions that immigrant groups can
develop, but that in the case of those made up mostly of low-skilled
workers require extensive outside support (42). Prior results based
on a large survey of adult immigrants found that all immigrant
parents, regardless of nationality, have high educational aspirations
for their offspring and are willing to endure major sacrifices to
achieve these goals (8). Poorly educated and poorly received
migrant laborers living in transient communities lack, however, the
know-how or the resources to accomplish those ends. Mexicans are
not only the largest immigrant group in the nation but one which,
for the reasons explained previously, are among the most prone to
find themselves in this situation. To the extent that immigration
continues to meet the nation's demand for manual labor, compen-
satory programs of support to immigrant families and communities
must be put in place lest we confine a large number of these
workers' children to poverty and permanent social exclusion.
