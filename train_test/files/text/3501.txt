Introduction
The Kingdom of Bahrain is a small country with an area of
767 km2 and an estimated population of 1.3 million people,
according to the Central Informatics Organization (2016).
According to the Ministry of Education (2016), there are 206
government schools and 73 private schools offering educa-
tion to 189,244 students between the ages of 6 and 18. The
main objectives of Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030 include
stimulating and supporting the private sector to make it an
engine for growth and empowering Bahrainis to become the
employees of choice for the labor market. The Bahrain's
Economic Vision 2030 is designed the main driver of all
recent reforms: economic, political, and social (Bahrain
Economic Board, 2016). Starting in 2008, and after finishing
the diagnostic and planning stages, major educational reforms
have been introduced in Bahrain, including the establishment
of the Education & Training Quality Authority (BQA)
("Decree No. (32) of 2008 on Establishing the Quality
Assurance Authority for Education & Training (No. 2844),"
2008). The Directorate of Government Schools Review
(DGS), as one responsible party to the BQA, and responsible
for reviewing all government schools'performance in Bahrain
(BQA, 2016), has completed two cycles of reviews: one
between 2008 and 2011 and the other between 2011 and 2014.
This report compares both cycles and summarizes the most
important characteristics of both cycles.
Based on the results and analyses of both the review
cycles that took place between 2008 and 2014, this article
will answer the following research questions:
Research Question 1: What are the main issues that can
be identified by comparing Cycle 1 and Cycle 2?
Research Question 2: What are the best ways to address
those issues going forward, to improve the overall perfor-
mance of schools in Bahrain?
Quality Review Model of Schools
Educators globally have argued over the years that their pro-
fessional freedom must be protected from external quality
assessment, as they consider it a sign of distrust and prefer

Schools' Performance: A Quality
Perspective

Abstract
Since 2005, education in the Kingdom of Bahrain has undergone major reforms as part of the National Education Reform
Project to achieve the goals of Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030. The Education & Training Quality Authority (BQA) was
created by a Royal Decree as an independent entity established that is responsible for ensuring quality in education and
training in the Bahrain. The Directorate of Government Schools Review (DGS) is under the umbrella of BQA and responsible
for conducting quality reviews for all Bahraini government schools. Upon successfully completing two cycles of school
reviews (review cycle average is 4 years), this article compares the findings of two DGS review cycles. In December 2014,
the DGS completed its second review of 206 schools. Generally, the results showed an increase in the polarity of the ratings.
Analysis of the results showed the following: In terms of schools' environments, it is generally safe with equal infrastructure
and learning resources among most schools; the performance gap between male and female students is widening; the
field of technical and commercial education still faces challenges; parental involvement is limited, despite opportunities
for participation; and available technology is used inconsistently. In addition, some schools that are judged inadequate face
increased challenges to improvement.

internal quality assurance processes (Doherty, 2004). During
the last three decades, more emphasis was placed on linking
the goals of national economic growth to educational quality,
focusing on preparing students to be fit for a continuously
changing market (Ladd & Loeb, 2013). Therefore, educa-
tional policies encouraged educational systems to offer
greater freedom in moving toward more decentralized edu-
cational management systems, with an emphasis on increased
accountability to external stakeholders (MacBeath, 2006).
This accountability is to be guided by clear criteria and a
framework that is understood and agreed upon by various
stakeholders.
Quality reviews and inspections vary between educational
systems around the world in accordance with their individual
needs and backgrounds (Brundrett & Rhodes, 2011). The
review framework adopted by DGS in the Kingdom of
Bahrain is based on the philosophy of professional develop-
ment through performance review by "critical friends."
These critical friends are peers in the field of education who
have considerable experience in teaching and managing
schools. The criteria by which schools are judged are consid-
ered to be generic; however, molding schools into the same
way of doing things is not the aim. Rather, the purpose of the
evaluation is to improve students' academic performance
and enhance their personal development. The model adopted
by the DGS is published in the Schools Review Handbook
and is based on the following three components (BQA,
2014):
1. Quality of outcomes
·
· Students' academic achievement
·
· Students' personal development
2. Quality of main processes
·
· Teaching and learning
·
· Support and guidance
3. Quality assurance of outcomes and processes
·
· Leadership, management, and governance.
After judging the quality of each of the above aspects,
reviewers examine schools' overall effectiveness and capac-
ity to improve. The DGS developed a classification system to
explain the criteria for each rating in detail and to ensure that
the performance of each school is evaluated according to the
same standards. The classifications are as follows (BQA,
2014):
1. Outstanding: This judgment is awarded if the prac-
tices of all or the vast majority of those related to the
criteria are diverse and of quality and highly produc-
tive. Performance and initiatives taken are excep-
tional and significantly exceed expectations. It
largely reflects improvement and development and
can be considered as a model to be followed.
2. Good: This judgment is awarded if the practices of
most of those related to the criteria are diverse and of
quality and productive. Performance is effective, and
initiatives are ongoing and sometimes exceed expec-
tations. It largely reflects improvement and
development.
3. Satisfactory: This judgment is awarded if the quality
of the practices of the majority of those related to the
criteria is at an acceptable level, and performance and
initiatives are at the expected level and reflect some
improvement and development.
4. Inadequate: This judgment is awarded if the quality
of the majority of the practices of those related to the
criteria is at an inappropriate level, and the school's
performance is at a level less than expected. This
judgment does not reflect any realistic expectation of
improvement.
General Finings
December 2014 marked the end of Cycle 2 reviews, as DGS
completed reviewing 206 schools: 132 primary schools and
primary-intermediate schools, 38 intermediate schools, and
36 secondary and intermediate-secondary schools (BQA,
2015). The overall effectiveness of government schools is
illustrated in Figure 1. This article will not include the results
of seven new government schools that had been reviewed
during Cycle 2 only; consequently, this comparison will
include only 199 schools.
The main themes of the review findings are as follows.
Increase in Polarity of Ratings
An increase in the polarity of the ratings was observed in
Cycle 2, in which the percentage of "outstanding" schools
increased and the number of "inadequate" schools also
increased, particularly in the elementary stage, as illustrated
in Figure 2. In Cycle 2, the rankings of some schools
improved by two levels; however, others reported a drop of
the same degree. This was related in many cases to the level
of the effectiveness of school initiatives and external follow-
up and support provided to schools. On the contrary, the
decline may have been influenced by multiple factors,

reviewed in Cycle 2.

including student academic levels at entry in different stages
and the quality and stability of leadership including senior
and middle management.
Overall Performance of Various School Levels
Improvements in the secondary level are the most notable
success story in Cycle 2 when compared with Cycle 1.
"Inadequate" school ratings decreased from 47% to 22%,
and the "outstanding" rating remained constant at one sec-
ondary school in each cycle of reviews, as shown in Figure 3.
Primary schools demonstrated a clear example of grade
polarity; the number of "outstanding" and "inadequate" rat-
ings almost doubled between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, as shown
in Figure 4.
The intermediate level was a point of concern for the
DGS. A 9% decrease was observed in the number of "satis-
factory" schools, as well as an 8% increase in the number of
"inadequate" schools led the total of "inadequate" intermedi-
ate schools to be 37%. "Good" and "outstanding" schools
did not make any progress, as indicated in Figure 5.
Table 1 charts the general distribution of schools by level,
rating, and gender. The girls' schools maintained their posi-
tive progress over the boys' schools in the "outstanding" and
"good" ratings. The boys'schools that were judged "satisfac-
tory" in the primary level and "inadequate" in all levels
increased over the girls' schools.
Performance of Schools: Analytical
Review
The most influential factors on the performance of schools as
analyzed in more than 400 review reports and as observed in
the two cycles of review were as follows:
Senior Leadership
Recommendations for leadership, management, and gov-
ernance focused on the ability of school management
teams to conduct accurate and comprehensive self-evalua-
tions and use the results to formulate a strategic plan and
follow it up. It also focused on the preparation and

implementation of teachers' career competency programs.
The work of senior leaders and their sustainable improve-
ment were negatively affected by staffing changes, which
they had no control over it. In addition, instability in senior
management positions had a direct impact on the perfor-
mance of the schools. A number of schools, especially
those that were struggling, had experienced changes in
their staffing up to 3 times between the first and second
review visits (an average of 3.5 years). The analysis shows
that these changes affected school ability to establish
effective management and quality control systems, and in
turn affected their development and progress. Results show
that "outstanding" schools had maintained stable staffing
for 2 to 6 years.
Middle Management and Teaching Staff
Middle managers--senior teachers in Bahrain--significantly
impact classroom practices by observing teachers' perfor-
mance and organizing professional development to ensure
good teaching processes. Review teams reported shortages in
middle management in a number of schools, which affected
the quality of class management and instructional differenti-
ation. In some schools, especially intermediate and second-
ary schools, shortages included senior teachers of core
subjects; this shortage was due to increasing subject special-
ization required and the nature and characteristics of this age
group (13-18 years). The workload of senior teachers in
schools was also affected by staffing changes, which required
more time to cope with low retention rates and more efforts
to be spent developing teachers' performance.
Gap in Performance Between Male and Female
Students
Overall, the gap in performance observed between boys and
girls in Cycle 1 remained consistent in Cycle 2. While this
comparison is a point of concern for many educational sys-
tems internationally, its impact is especially impactful in the
Kingdom. The consequences of the discrepancy are reflected
in communities, employment opportunities, and access
equality in higher education sector in particular. As
illustrated in Figure 6, "outstanding" ratings in girls' schools
were 6 times more prevalent than in boys' schools. Only 3%
of girls' schools were rated "inadequate," compared with
24% of boys' schools. Reports analysis shows that this dis-
crepancy is partially attributed to the difference in perfor-
mance levels between genders, relating to boys' lack of
readiness or motivation to learn. The quality of teaching and
learning practices in the schools may also have had an
impact. It is worth noting that the management and staffing
of the "outstanding" and "good" primary schools consisted
of females.
The School Environment
The school environment in Bahrain is generally safe, and
most schools have equal infrastructures and learning
resources. This promotes equal learning opportunities for all
students. Analysis results indicate that in many cases, new
buildings, facilities, and the availability of scientific technol-
ogy have had a direct impact on students'motivation to learn
and progress. However, some schools lack science and com-
puter laboratories and multipurpose halls. Few schools cov-
ered in this study face challenges related to inadequate
buildings or external hazards that threaten students' safety
when they come to and go from school. These schools do not
constitute the majority; nevertheless, such shortages are sig-
nificant to students' learning processes.

Technical and Commercial Education
In Bahrain, secondary education consists of four main tracks:
technical, commercial, scientific, and literacy. Technical and
commercial education is an important component of devel-
oped educational systems, and its importance increases as
countries seek to transform their service sectors and move
toward knowledge-based economies. Analysis results indi-
cate that, in general, students on the commercial track out-
performed their peers on the technical track. Students on the
commercial track showed weakness in basic skills in English
and mathematics, whereas students on the technical track did
not meet the desired outcomes in their theoretical lessons,
particularly English, but performed better in practical lessons
and showed more enthusiasm for those subjects. Students'
knowledge of English and some theoretical subjects is fun-
damental for both the commercial and technical tracks;
therefore, it is important to reconsider the use of diagnostic
tests and provide greater support based on students' ability
levels.
Role of Parents
Parents have a significant role in driving teaching and learning
processes and improving their children's academic achieve-
ment; they do this through following up their children prog-
ress, maintaining high expectations of them, and motivating
them to succeed. Analysis of reports shows that school man-
agement teams are keen to collect and implement parents'sug-
gestions and often formulate and activate parents' councils.
However, poor participation limits their impact. Although
more than one quarter of the schools in this study were judged
as "inadequate," parents' satisfaction was judged as "inade-
quate" in only 1% of schools. This reinforces that parents are
not aware of the impact of their active participation or that
they are poorly motivated to play more active role in their chil-
dren learning. Parents' councils should be activated through
constructive and continuous discussions with teachers
throughout the school year, and deciding on appropriate learn-
ing experience starting points of students through addressing
accurate analyses of their educational levels. In addition, par-
ents and teachers should jointly develop methods to achieve
competencies that are in line with students' abilities.
Input-Based Changes
Changes in the number of students in Bahrain and their back-
grounds, social classes, or cultures were not accompanied
with needed level of support in developing teachers with
sound induction programs to deal with students with special
needs. For instance, nonnative Arabic speakers, who com-
prise more than 20% of the population in some schools, were
not matched with appropriate teacher training programs that
address the needs of these students, which obstructed stu-
dents' progress.
Educational Technology and Its Use
In this age of digital culture, technological skills are among
the most important for students. With regard to the use of
educational technology, the analysis of review reports
showed, despite the availability of computer labs in the vast
majority of schools, that their use varied greatly.
"Outstanding" and "good" schools employed IT, in addition
to the use of blogs and websites, in their classroom practices
to serve the teaching and learning processes. They also con-
ducted some formative tests electronically. In these schools,
IT was also used for a portion of teachers' professional
development programs. Review reports showed that students
generally had moderate IT skills; for example, in the most
effective schools, students initiated the transfer of some parts
of the curriculum into e-lessons. However, such practices
varied among schools, especially those with "satisfactory"
and "inadequate" ratings, in which the use of electronic pro-
jectors was the extent of IT that was observed. This limita-
tion can impact students' academic progress. It is worth
mentioning that the use of e-learning varies in accordance
with educational stages, and it was used more in primary
schools than in the intermediate and secondary schools.
Increase in the Number of
"Inadequate" Schools
The number of "inadequate" schools in Cycle 1 was 41, com-
pared with 55 in Cycle 2. This change negatively affects the
achievement of Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030. The most
important reasons for the increase in schools rated "inade-
quate" include the following: the decline of students'academic
achievement, as there was a noticeable variance between the
students'pass rates and proficiency rates; a decline in students'
acquisition of basic skills such as reading and writing inArabic
and English, arithmetical skills in mathematics, and applied
skills in science; weakness of students'personal development,
as most students do not effectively participate in life at school,
show enthusiasm toward learning, or take on leadership roles.
In addition, other factors, as reports analysis show, include
teaching- and learning-related problems, such as ineffective
teaching strategies and poor classroom management. Also,
inaccurate self-evaluation, poor strategic planning, the turn-
over of school leaders, and ineffective professional develop-
ment programs for teachers were another factors contributed
to the poor performance.
Nineteen schools were judged as being "inadequate" in
both cycles. These schools are still causing concern, and
organizations must take immediate intervention actions.
Such actions may include employing more experienced
teachers, ensuring close follow-up, improving parents'
awareness, and acquiring the necessary support to address
schools' specific needs to enhance outcomes and improve
ratings. It is important to remember that some students will
receive their entire education from "inadequate" schools.
6 SAGE Open
Ways Forward
The comparison between the two cycles of reviews has
revealed several overall areas for improvement. Actions by
regulatory bodies should
·
· Apply and develop the practices of the "outstanding"
schools to ensure the sustainability of those schools'
performance and to propagate best practices in other
schools;
·
· Enable students to acquire basic skills in all educa-
tional stages and tracks;
·
· Ensure the improvement of "inadequate" schools'
performance, especially those that face challenges and
have received the same grade in two review cycles;
·
· Consider the stability of schools' staff and address
shortages in human resources, especially teachers of
core subjects and senior teachers;
·
· Work on reducing the gap between boys' and girls'
performance and achievement in general, and work to
motivate boys to learn and achieve academically;
·
· Offer support for students' needs across all different
levels through training and professional development
programs for staff;
·
· Address the shortages of facilities and resources such
as multipurpose halls, science labs, and technology, to
establish similar learning conditions among schools
and facilitate better learning opportunities;
·
· Encourage an e-learning culture among students, par-
ents, and teachers, enabling them to make optimal use
of computer labs and other technology that supports
the teaching and learning processes;
·
· Ensure the safety of buildings, as well as freedom
from hazards that may threaten students' security dur-
ing their arrival and departure; and
·
· Increase parents' awareness of the importance of their
participation in the educational process.
