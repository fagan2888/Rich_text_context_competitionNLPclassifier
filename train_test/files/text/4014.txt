Introduction
Drowning fatalities continue to be a serious issue worldwide
with an estimated 388,000 people dying each year from this
largely preventable cause (World Health Organization,
2004). In Australia, in 2011, drowning fatalities increased for
the third year in a row (Royal Life Saving Society, 2011).
More specifically, between 1st July 2010 and 30th June 2011,
drowning claimed the lives of 315 people, which represents
an 11% increase on the previous 5-year average (Royal Life
Saving Society, 2011). Drowning deaths for men aged 18 to
34 years, in particular, have almost doubled in the past 3
years (Royal Life Saving Society, 2011), and this cohort of
the population is also identified as being a high risk group in
other developed countries (Lifesaving Society Canada,
2012). Alcohol and drugs are often present among young
males, and particularly for males aged 18 to 34 years, alcohol
is considered to be a significant risk factor for drowning
(Royal Life Saving Society, 2011). There is mounting evi-
dence confirming the risk between alcohol use and drowning
during recreational aquatic activities (Driscoll, Harrison, &
Steenkamp, 2003). Data on unintentional drowning deaths in
Australia found that within the 5-year period investigated,
alcohol was involved in 21.6% of all drowning deaths
(Franklin, Scarr, & Pearn, 2010). Each year it is estimated
that at least 20% of all adult drowning deaths are attributed
to alcohol consumption, with this figure increasing to 41% in
the younger population groups (Royal Life Saving
Association, 2011). If the prevalence of drinking and swim-
ming fatalities in young men has to decrease, a clear,
theoretically based understanding of males' decision making
in this context is needed.
The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) is
one of the most influential models in explaining people's
decision making for a range of health and social behaviors
(Armitage & Conner, 2001) and, thus, may be a useful model
to adopt to understand this specific risk-taking behavior of
drinking and swimming. The TPB specifies intentions as the
proximal determinant of behavior, with intentions predicted
by attitude (positive/negative evaluations of the behavior),
subjective norm (perceived pressure from others to perform
the behavior), and perceived behavioral control (PBC; per-
ceived ease/difficulty of performing the behavior, also
believed to influence behavior directly; Ajzen, 1991).
Attitude, subjective norm, and PBC are informed by underly-
ing behavioral beliefs (costs and benefits), normative beliefs
(others' approval/disapproval), and control beliefs (barriers
and motivators), respectively (Ajzen, 1991). Measures of
such underlying beliefs have increased our understanding of
people's behavior in a range of risk taking domains such as
ecstasy use (Conner, Sherlock, & Orbell, 1998), safer sex
(White, Terry, & Hogg, 1994), complying with speed limits
(Elliott, Armitage, & Baughan, 2005), and binge drinking

Critical Beliefs Underlying Young
Australian Males' Intentions to Engage in
Drinking and Swimming
Kyra Hamilton1 and Hannah Schmidt1
Abstract
This study examined key targets for interventions aimed at reducing drinking and swimming among young males, an at-risk
group for drowning. Two-hundred and eleven Australian males aged 18 to 34 years completed a Theory of Planned Behavior
belief-based questionnaire either online or paper based. Behavioral beliefs of "be more relaxed" and "having fun," normative
beliefs of "friends/mates" and "parents," and the control belief of "presence of other people" were revealed as independent
predictors of intentions to drink and swim. These identified beliefs can be used to inform interventions to challenge young
males' alcohol use in, on, and around water.

behavior (French & Cooke, 2012). No previous study has,
however, documented the beliefs underlying males' inten-
tions to engage in drinking and swimming. Ajzen (1991) sug-
gests that belief elicitation should occur for each new behavior
or target population being investigated as the underlying rea-
sons as to why people hold certain attitudes, perceptions of
social pressure, and behavioral control may differ according
to the specific behavior or population being targeted. Taking
this targeted approach to identifying the beliefs of young
males, an at-risk group of drinking and swimming-related
deaths, in this context is important given that drowning fatali-
ties are on the rise (Royal Life Saving Society, 2011).
Using the TPB as a theoretical framework, we aimed to
investigate the critical beliefs that underlie males' intentions
to drink and swim. First, we expected that significant corre-
lations would be observed between the behavioral, norma-
tive, and control beliefs for drinking and swimming. Second,
we expected that some of the significant key beliefs would
independently predict males'intentions. Finally, in an explor-
atory manner, we examined the relative number of males
who fully and strongly accepted each of these beliefs to
determine the usefulness of the belief for subsequent inter-
vention strategies.
Method
Participants
The sample comprised 211 Australian males ranging in age
from 18 to 34 years (M age = 23.93, SD = 4.01). Participants
were included in the study if they met the age requirement
and engaged in alcohol use. The second author recruited par-
ticipants via convenience sampling methods using three
main recruitment strategies: online advertising (e.g.,
Facebook), face-to-face (e.g., university campuses, public
beaches), and snowball. Participants were given the option to
enter into a prize draw, to win one of five AUD$20 depart-
ment store gift cards or, if appropriate, receive course credit.
The majority of participants reported living in Queensland
(n = 201; 95.3%), came from an English-speaking back-
ground (n = 190, 90.5%), held a paying job (n = 175, 82.9%),
and were not suffering from an acute/chronic medical condi-
tion (n = 202, 95.7%) or taking medication that may impair
judgment (n = 209, 99.1%). Almost half of the participants
were in a partnered relationship (n = 92, 44.3%) and did not
have children (n = 186, 89%). Two items measuring the typi-
cal quantity of standard drinks consumed in a single occasion
and the frequency of heavy drinking episodes taken from the
psychometrically sound (Reinert & Allen, 2007) Alcohol
Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Babor, Higgins-
Biddle, Saunders, & Monterio, 2001) indicated that the
majority of participants (n =184, 94.8%), when consuming
alcohol, did so at hazardous levels. In addition, 45% of the
men indicated they engaged to a greater than small extent in
drinking and swimming (scored  2 on a 7-point
scale), measured with a single item assessing participants'
engagement in drinking and swimming in the previous 6
months ("In the past 6 months, to what extent did you drink
and swim," scored a small extent [1] to a large extent [7]).
Measures
Target behavior.Consistent with Ajzen's (1991), the target
behavior was defined as drinking and swimming in the next 6
months. Drinking was operationalized as having a blood alco-
hol concentration (BAC) of more than 0.05. This definition
was adopted in line with drunk walking (Haque et al., 2012)
and drunk driving research (Rivis, Abraham, & Snook, 2011),
and research that indicates having a BAC of more than 0.05
impairs judgment and performance ability (Howat, Sleet, &
Smith, 1991). To assist participants with this definition, a stan-
dard drink chart was presented with accompanied information
referring to amount of alcohol which can be consumed to
remain under 0.05. Swimming was operationalized as partak-
ing in activities explicitly related to water and undertaken for
fun, pleasure, or amateur sport. Boating and personal water
crafts were excluded as operation of such vehicles while intox-
icated is illegal and may carry additional social undesirability
affecting self-reported intentions. The behaviors applied to
open water ways, such as rivers, creeks, streams, lakes, oceans,
and harbors, as open water ways have been identified as high-
risk locations with the largest number of drowning deaths
(Royal Life Saving Society, 2011). Accordingly, public and
private swimming pools were excluded. The operationaliza-
tion of swimming behavior was guided by Driscoll et al.'s
(2003) definition of recreational aquatic activities. These defi-
nitions were used consistently in all waves of data.
Elicitation Pilot Study
Following guidelines outlined by Ajzen (1991), an elicitation
pilot study (n = 20; M age = 23.95, SD = 3.30) was conducted
to identify salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs
concerning drinking and swimming. The pilot questionnaire
comprised open-ended question as outlined by Fishbein and
Ajzen (1975). Thematic content analysis was undertaken to
identify the most common responses to each of the TPB
belief-based questions and formed the beliefs to be assessed
in the current study (Joffe & Yardley, 2004).
Main Questionnaire
The TPB constructs were measured in accordance with stan-
dard TPB procedures (Ajzen, 1991). To maximize the congru-
ence between the prediction and criterion variables, the TPB
variables were measured at the same level specified and con-
structed in line with TPB recommendations (Ajzen, 1991).
Intention. Five items assessed the strength of intention to per-
form the target behavior (e.g., I intend to drink and swim,
Hamilton and Schmidt 3
scored strongly disagree [1] to strongly agree [7]). The mea-
sure was reliable with an alpha coefficient of .96.
Behavioral beliefs.Behavioral beliefs were assessed by the
eight single-item salient behavioral beliefs derived from the
pilot study. Participants were asked to indicate how likely the
five costs (e.g., have impaired swimming ability) and the
three benefits (e.g., be more social) would result if they
engaged in drinking and swimming in the next 6 months.
Responses ranged from extremely unlikely (1) to extremely
likely (7).
Normative beliefs.Normative beliefs were assessed by the
seven single-item specific referents identified in the elicita-
tion study. Participants were asked to rate how likely the
seven referents (e.g., partner/girlfriend, parents) would
approve of them drinking and swimming in the next 6
months. Responses ranged from extremely unlikely (1) to
extremely likely (7).
Control beliefs.Control beliefs were assessed by the three
single-item facilitators (e.g., presence of other people) and
three single-item inhibitors (e.g., bad water conditions)
derived from the elicitation study. Participants rated how
likely it was that these factors would prevent them from
drinking and swimming in the next 6 months, and responses
ranged from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).
Design and Procedure
Ethical clearance was granted by the University Human
Research Ethics Committee. A cross-sectional correlational
design was adopted to investigate the ability of the TPB and
additional variables to predict males' intentions to drink and
swim. The study involved the completion of a self-report
questionnaire assessing the TPB standard and belief-based
constructs and measures of group norm, anticipated regret,
and risk perceptions either online (n =77, 36.5%) or paper-
based (n =134, 63.5%). This study focused on the belief-
based items in predicting males' drinking and swimming
intentions to highlight key targets for interventions to combat
this risk-taking behavior (Fishbein, von Haeften, &
Appleyard, 2001). Online findings compared with traditional
pen-and-paper data have been shown to be equivocal (Lewis,
Watson, & White, 2009). In the current study, bivariate anal-
yses with Bonferroni adjustment (to avoid chance capitaliza-
tion) of the study's variables across the methods of
questionnaire delivery reveal no substantive differences.
Data Analysis
To determine the critical beliefs that guide males' intention
to drink and swim, guidelines as specified by von Haeften,
Fishbein, Kasprzyk, and Montano (2001) were followed.
First, to identify the beliefs which are significantly correlated
with males' intentions, the Pearson product­moment
correlation matrix was analyzed. Second, to identify the key
beliefs which make independent, significant contributions to
intention within each belief-based measure (e.g., behavioral,
normative, and control beliefs), significant beliefs are entered
in a stepwise multiple regression analysis. Third, to identify
critical beliefs, all key beliefs, which made an independent
significant contribution to the prediction of intentions, were
entered into a final regression. Last, to identify those critical
beliefs for resultant interventions, in an exploratory analysis,
the principles of Hornik and Woolf (1999) were applied,
which suggests that for effective intervention programs there
should be a relative number of individuals who do not already
hold the belief. Therefore, as a final step, critical beliefs were
examined to determine the percentage of males who fully
and strongly accept the belief.

and five of the eight control beliefs were significantly corre-
lated with intention (r = .23 to .68). Multiple regression anal-
ysis on the significant behavioral beliefs revealed "having
fun" ( = .41), "feel more relaxed" ( = .26), and "increased
chance of injury/accidents" ( = .11), as significant predic-
tors of intention. Multiple regression analysis on the signifi-
cant normative beliefs revealed "friends/mates" ( = .49),
"partner/girlfriend" ( = .18), and "parents" ( = .16) as sig-
nificant predictors of intention. Multiple regression analysis
on the significant control beliefs revealed "others around me
drinking" ( = -.19), "presence of other people" ( = -.16),
and "presence of authority figures" ( = -.22), as significant
predictors of intention.
To identify critical beliefs, the nine significant individual
belief predictors mentioned above were entered into a final
regression analysis. Five critical beliefs, "feel more relaxed,"
"having fun," "friends/mates," "parents," and "presence of
other people," were identified as significant independent pre-
dictors of intention. Of these critical beliefs, there were a
large percentage of males who did not already fully or
strongly accept these beliefs, refer to Table 2. The final
model explained 57% (adjusted R2 = .56) of the variance in
intentions to drink and swim, F(5, 192) = 51.23, p < .001.
Discussion
The current study aimed to investigate using a TPB belief-
based approach the critical beliefs that underlie males' inten-
tions to drink and swim; an investigation not yet undertaken
systematically in this at-risk group. Support was provided for
underlying beliefs guiding males' decisions in this context in
that various behavioral, normative, and controls beliefs were
identified as making an independent contribution to inten-
tion. The findings of this study support that of previous
research, where the role of beliefs in guiding people's deci-
sions have been noted in the prediction of general
health-related behaviors (e.g., Armitage & Conner, 2001) as
well as in health risk behaviors, such as binge drinking
(French & Cooke, 2012; Johnston & White, 2003) and
ecstasy use (Conner et al., 1998).
The results of the current study provide the basis for the
beliefs to target in resultant intervention work aimed at com-
bating young males' drinking and swimming behavior. First,
in examining the behavioral beliefs suggests that males focus
on their evaluations of the outcomes of engaging in drinking
and swimming when forming an intention to do so.
Specifically, males focus on whether or not they believe that
drinking and swimming will result in them feeling more
relaxed and having fun. Moreover, 54% of males endorsed
fully or strongly as accepting the belief that drinking and
swimming would be fun. Thus, for young males, the social
context in which they are engaged is important in forming an
intention to undertake such a risky behavior of drinking and
swimming. These findings have important implications for
resultant interventions to discourage such behaviors and
highlight in particular the need to promote the not so fun side
of drinking and swimming.
Although more behavioral disadvantages compared with
advantages were included within the study (as a result of
pilot testing), only positive behavioral outcomes seem to
guide males' intentions to drink and swim; revealing none of
the beliefs underlying perceptions of risk as being influential
in this context. This finding could suggest that participants
did not perceive that drinking and swimming is a risky
behavior that may incur negative consequences, similar to
previous findings on mobile phone use while driving (White,
Hyde, Walsh, & Watson, 2010). It could also be the case that
these males were inaccurate in estimating their beliefs about
the negative consequences of drinking and swimming.
Previous results have found men to be particularly inaccurate
in their risk perceptions, by overestimating their ability and
underestimating the risk involved regarding aquatic activity
Hamilton and Schmidt 5
(McCool, Ameratunga, Moran, & Robinson, 2009). In addi-
tion, the sample in this study comprised heavy drinkers, and
generally, heavy drinkers perceive more positive and less
negative outcomes from alcohol use than light drinkers
(Wiers, van Woerden, Smulders, & de Jong, 2002).
The results revealed also important information on nor-
mative beliefs indicating further that not only is the social
context important to consider but the social pressure from
important others is an important area which can be targeted
to reduce men's drinking and swimming behaviors. The
findings suggest that it is closer (e.g., friends, parents),
rather than more distant people (e.g., police), who are most
influential on males' intentions to drink and swim. The
results suggest that men who feel that their friends and par-
ents think that they should drink and swim are more likely
to form an intention to do so--a finding consistent with
normative influences identified in risky drinking domains
(Johnson & White, 2004). The influence of peers and
friends on decisions to use alcohol has been consistently
supported in the literature (Marcoux & Shope, 1997), with
the men in this study perceiving that their friends/mates
moderately approved of the behavior (M = 4.11, SD =
1.83). Accordingly, the perceived social pressure from
friends/mates are important to consider in the context of
young males' drinking and swimming, and, as indicated by
the percentage of men who hold this belief, the belief does
not appear to be salient and, thus, may be an effective strat-
egy to challenge. In addition, the results suggest that the
more men feel that their parents approve of the behavior,
the more pressure they feel to drink and swim. Although
revealed as a critical belief, with parental approval posi-
tively correlated with intention, the mean indicated that
perceived levels of approval were low (M = 2.04, SD =
1.38), with very minimal participants (2.8%) strongly or
fully accepting the belief that parents approve of such a
risky behavior. Therefore, although parents may exert
influence over intention to drink and swim, the majority
view parents as non-approving of the behavior and, thus,
targeting parents' disapproval rather than their approval
may be an effective strategy for challenging males' inten-
tions to drink and swim.
Finally, inspection of the control beliefs revealed the
belief of the presence of other people as a significant inde-
pendent predictor of males' intention to drink and swim.
Specifically, the less likely other people are perceived to be
present when one engages in drinking and swimming the less
likely one will intend to do so. The finding concurs with pre-
vious research that suggests men are more likely to engage in
risk-taking behaviors when others are present (Varela &
Pritchard, 2011). This belief may be rationalized on the basis
that in the event that something goes wrong, other people
will be there to help. To combat this belief and to reduce the
incidence of males drinking and swimming, it may be useful
for resultant interventions to highlight the classic bystander
effect (Fischer et al., 2011; Latane & Darley, 1970), which
states that in an emergency people are less likely to help
when they are with others.
Although the current study has a number of strengths
including the examination of an at-risk population for drown-
ing, having a relatively large representative sample, and
using a well-established theoretical approach to identify crit-
ical drinking and swimming beliefs, the current study also
has a number of limitations. First, the sample predominately
came from an English-speaking background and the find-
ings, therefore, may not be generalized to other ethnic com-
munities. Previous research has indicated that Caucasians
drink more than other races/nationalities (Windle, 2003),
which could in part explain the high rates of hazardous drink-
ing practices indicated within the sample. Thus, future
research is needed to confirm the study's findings with indi-
viduals from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds.
Furthermore, the use of self-report measures, which tend to
be susceptible to social desirability bias, may have led to an
under-reporting of socially undesirable behaviors (Davis,
Thake, & Vilhena, 2010). However, the TPB has been shown
to be a good predictor of both actual and self-reported behav-
ior (Armitage & Conner, 2001) and given the difficulty of
accurate objective measures within the current context, self-
report measures provide a practical alternative. The study
also examined intentions only without explicitly examining
actual drinking and swimming behavior. Although due to the
timing of data collection being conducted over winter, and
given the target behavior is not one which is expected to fre-
quently occur especially in the colder season, intentions have
been shown to be the strongest predictor of subsequent
behavior explaining on average 27% of the variance
(Armitage & Conner, 2001). However, further examination
of the relationship between the TPB constructs and behav-
ioral performance may allow for a more comprehensive
understanding of males' drinking and swimming participa-
tion. In addition, the drinking behavior in the current study
was operationalized as having a BAC of more than 0.05, and
it may be useful to assess the intentions of males to drink and
swim at more or less hazardous drinking levels to determine
if similar beliefs hold for different levels of drinking behav-
iors. Finally, although the study revealed a number of beliefs
to target in intervention programs, research is needed to
determine the efficacy of interventions targeting such beliefs
in changing males' intention and subsequently behavior.
Overall, the current study aimed to provide an under-
standing of the beliefs underlying the drinking and swim-
ming behaviors among Australian men, which, to date, has
received scant empirical attention. To the authors' knowl-
edge, this is the first study to investigate the beliefs of male
alcohol use and recreational swimming from a sound theo-
retical basis. The study identified a number of beliefs under-
lying this risk taking behavior that can be used in resultant
intervention strategies aimed at decreasing males'swimming
and drinking. Given that drowning is a common yet prevent-
able problem, an increased understanding for at-risk target
6 SAGE Open
populations is required to reduce drowning rates. This study
was able to determine those critical beliefs of young males'
intentions to drink and swim that can now inform the devel-
opment of resultant intervention and prevention programs
designed to discourage alcohol use in, on, or around water.
