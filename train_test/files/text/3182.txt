Non-technical summary
Research Question
Do peers have an impact on the consumption choice of the individual? What are the
mechanisms behind it? Are certain individuals with certain characteristics (i.e. cognitive
ability, overconfidence etc.) more affected?
Contribution
Most previous studies on peer effects rely on observational data. This, however, makes
a clear identification of peer effects difficult. Measuring the extent to which peers affect
decision making is challenging because social group formation is usually endogenous,
meaning that observed peer effects may be due to individuals in a group being more
similar than other individuals. This complicates causal inference. If belonging to a social
group is a matter of deliberate choice, it is difficult to assign causality to the impact of
the group itself. We try to overcome this using a novel lab-in-a-field experiment. In the
experiment, we let respondents chose between a temptation good i.e. a combination of
sweet and salty snacks and an increasing amount of money. In the control group every
respondent makes their own decision away from their peers, while in the treatment group
respondents still make their own decision, but do so while observing each other. This is
the first study that uses a lab-in-the-field experiment to study the impact of peer effects
on individual consumption choice.
Results
We find that individual choices are influenced by peers if they perform the experiment in
the treatment group where they are able to observe their peers. In other words, we find
conformity within a group as the standard deviation in groups that observe each other
is lower. In further analysis we look into the possible mechanism behind this conformity.
We study the effect of familiarity with the product and find that peer observation can
counteract the effect of a lack of knowledge of a product. We also find evidence that
respondents follow the choices of their peer group. Finally, we investigate treatment
heterogeneities. We find that individuals with high cognitive ability, are less likely to
choose the tasty treat, while the same effect is not to be found for overconfident or high-
income individuals. We also find evidence that those that live in closer knit communities
are more likely to succumb to peer effects. Hence, we provide clear evidence of peer effects
and conclude that peer observation leads to conformity.

Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of peer observation on the consumption decisions
of rural households in Thailand using a lab-in-the-field experiment. We find that
those groups that observe each other show lower within group standard deviation
in their decisions. Thus, we find evidence for conformity. Further, we find that
individual's consumption choice is influenced by the group choice controlling for
large number of individual, household, and village characteristics. We find that
unfamiliarity of the product is counteracted by peer effects. Finally, we find evidence
of treatment heterogeneity with regards to cognitive ability and village size.

1 Introduction
The feeling of buying something because someone else has it is a feeling familiar to many.
Despite anecdotal evidence that peers exert a very powerful influence over one's consump-
tion behavior, there has been a surprising lack of empirical and experimental research on
this topic. In traditional economic theory consumption choices are regarded as a function
of budget, price and personal preferences. The effect of those around us is rarely consid-
ered. In this study we aim to change this and define peer effects as the simple effect that
leads individuals to behave in a similar way to those around them.
The study of peer effects in consumption choices is not just crucial in advancing fur-
ther understanding of individual decision-making, but at a second look, can also have an
important effect on policy. Peer effects may influence the success of cash transfer pro-
grams. If peer effects are prevalent they could have an effect on consumption decisions
taken with cash grants for instance. At the same time, policy makers who are interested
in increasing the uptake of certain goods such as health services or innovative technology
could use peer effects in order to increase consumption of such goods.
One reason why economists have largely ignored peer effects on consumption choice
is that identifying peer effects comes with a number of challenges. Measuring the extent
to which peers affect decision making is challenging because social group formation is
usually endogenous, meaning that observed peer effects may be due to individuals in a
group being more similar than other individuals, and hence this complicates causal in-
ference. If belonging to a social group is a matter of deliberate choice, it is difficult to
assign causality to the impact of the group itself (Manski, 1993). This effect is referred
to as correlated effects. Furthermore, observed peer effects may be caused by unobserved
time-varying factors, also known as contextual effects, when individuals that are part
of the same group also experience the same things. In addition, since individuals may
make simultaneous decisions affecting each other it becomes difficult to determine causal
behavior.
Therefore, identifying peer effects from observational data is problematic. We solve
this problem by using a lab-in-the-field experiment to provide clear evidence of peer effects
on consumption choices in a fully controlled setting where no possible confounding factor
1
can hinder identification. To the best of our knowledge, no experiment of peer effects in
consumption decisions has been conducted so far. Our experimental setting allows us to
overcome the Manskian problem of contextual and correlated effects. Thus, we are able
to isolate endogenous peer effects. In this paper, we aim to (i) identify and estimate the
existence of peer effects in terms of consumption decisions; (ii) investigate some mecha-
nisms through which peer effects operate; and (iii) test whether there are differences in
the way certain people are affected by their peers.
We are able to control for a large number personal and local confounding factors
because our experimental results can be complemented with a large household survey
containing a wide-range of socio-economic information of the respondents and the village
in which they live. We perform the experiment in rural Thailand because of the prevalence
of close-knit communities. Our respondents live in relatively small villages and have often
lived there for many generations. In other words, even though assignment to a group is
random; groups are made up of people that actually know each other (Mangyo and Park,
2011). Hence our experiment provides more external validity than other experiments that
are performed with complete strangers.
The design of our experiment is straightforward: we test consumption choices by sim-
ply offering respondents the choice between a combination of sweet and salty snacks, i.e.
the temptation good1 (called the tasty treat or TT from here on) and money. The amount
of money offered increases by ten Baht in every round whereas the tasty treat stays the
same. In the control group, respondents have to make their consumption choices on their
own, separated from the rest of the respondents. In the treatment group, each respondent
still makes his/her own decision, but all respondents observe each other. Hence, the only
difference between treatment and control group is peer observation and so any difference
in outcome can be attributed to peer observation.
Our experimental study has a number of advantages that enable us to tackle the prob-
lems described by Manski (1993, 2000). We are able to solve the problem of correlated
effects by randomizing the village in which the experiment is performed under peer obser-
vation. Given our large sample size, we assume that our villages are the same on average
1Temptation goods are defined as goods that provide the current self with positive utility, but negative
utility to any future self, for instance alcohol, cigarettes or unhealthy foods (Banerjee and Mullainathan,
2010).
2
and that effects can simply be attributed to peer observation. In addition we have very
detailed information about the individual, their household and the village in which they
live. Randomization of our sample in observing and non-observing groups on the village
level combined with detailed information about village and household characteristics cir-
cumvents the problem of correlated effects. In addition, as we perform an experiment that
lasts a short time in a relatively controlled environment, we are able to avoid problems
caused by contextual or time-variant unobservables that affect all group members. Thus,
our research design enables us to directly identify peer effects by comparing outcomes
for those groups that performed the experiment with and without peer observation. In
order to identify endogenous peer effects, we use the model of endogenous peer effects
with leave-out mean in which individuals average consumption is regressed on the mean
of the group ? excluding the individual himself (Angrist, 2014).
We focus in particular on the effect of peer's observation on temptation goods, since
consumption choices for temptation goods are particularly susceptible to the influence of
peer effects, as has been shown, especially for young people in social psychology (Gunter
and Furnham, 1998; Steinberg and Cauffman, 1996). Another reason for choosing temp-
tation goods was that there are no real economic or welfare needs for the temptation
goods that are offered. The idea behind this is that playing the game with goods that
are necessities may have confounding effects on the demand for the good compared to the
money offered.
In order to support our experimental analysis, we develop a theoretical framework. We
adjust a standard model of consumer choice with a cost imposed on the decision maker
when deviating from the group choice. We argue that this cost represents a social cost ­
arising from not conforming to the group. We can show using this model that under the
peer treatment extreme choices are more costly and therefore, the demand curve for the
tasty treat is flatter. This makes extreme choices less likely.
Our experimental data confirms the prediction of the model. Specifically, we find that
observing groups - those that sit in close proximity with each other - have a higher group
minimum and a lower group maximum. Consequentially, the standard deviation for ob-
serving groups is lower than for those groups that simply played at the same time, but
without peer observation.
3
In further analysis, we confirm this finding by showing that the group average, exclud-
ing the individual him/herself, has a positive and significant influence on the decisions
made by the individual respondent, however, only when the experiment is performed with
peer observation. Most importantly, the effect is not significant when the experiment is
performed in non-observing groups. The effect being only present in the observing groups
shows us that it can be attributed to the presence of peers and not to other possible
effects.
Next, we aim to explore the mechanisms behind the peer effect. There are two possible
reasons for this; either the respondents feel that the others in a group have better infor-
mation or they are gaining some kind of psychological benefit from conforming to others.
We find evidence that unfamiliarity with a product is counteracted by peer observations,
indicating some evidence for the first mechanism. We can also show that the number of
individuals that chose a TT previously has an effect on the likelihood of chosing the TT
in a given round. Hence, we believe that there is an effect beyond information transfer.
Subsequently, we look at treatment heterogeneities to analyze whether there is a dif-
ference in peer effects for individuals with different background characteristics. We show
that those with the highest cognitive ability are less susceptible to peer effects. Using
the same technique, we do not find any effect for overconfident, underconfident or higher
income respondents. Similarly, we find that peer effects seem to be stronger for those that
live in small villages compared to those that live in large villages.
To sum up, we are able to show using a lab-in-the-field experiment that the observation
of peers has a significant impact on consumption choices. We find evidence of conver-
gence in consumption choices when observing one's peers. Our results contribute to the
literature on conformity and herding behavior where conformity is defined as an intrinsic
taste to follow others (Goeree and Yariv, 2010), driven by factors such as popularity,
observational learning, information, esteem and respect (Bernheim, 1994). Experimental
findings of Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and Bolton and Ockenfels (2000) show that a possi-
ble explanations for herding behavior is the reduction in expected inequality or inequality
aversion among subjects.
A number of experimental studies use a similar experimental design to study peer
effects; Falk and Ichio (2006), randomly assign participants either to a group or not in
4
order to study the effect of peers on productivity. In another study Baecker and Mechtel
(2014) use a similar design in order to study the effect of peers on cheating behaviour.
These studies have the advantage that they provide a clear counterfactual and control for
contextual effects, thus providing the cleanest evidence on peer effects.
Further empirical evidence on peer-group phenomena can be found in the context of
other economic behaviors. They seem to have a positive impact, for instance, in terms
of workers' productivity (Guryan et al., 2009; Mas and Moretti, 2009; Bandiera et al.,
2010), education (Sacerdote, 2001; Imberman et al., 2012), technology adaptation (Oster
and Thornton, 2012), and saving and investment decisions (Duflo and Saez, 2003; Viscusi
et al., 2011). Georgarakos et al. (2014) show that believing to be relatively worse off than
one's social circle influence the amount of debt held. The link between peer effects and
consumption is not new. Veblen (1898) argued that people consume certain conspicuous
goods in order to increase their social standing. Luttmer (2004) shows that living amongst
richer individuals leads to higher consumption while at the same time reducing happi-
ness. These results, however, rely mostly on observational data which makes it difficult
to separate peer effects from the effect of confounding factors.
Recent papers try to measure peer effects in terms of education using, for instance,
natural experiments to overcome the problem of correlated effects such as the random
assignment of college students to their respective dorms (Sacerdote, 2001; Chetty et al.,
2015) or the exogenous influx of students in neighboring schools after the hurricane Ka-
trina (Imberman et al., 2012). Roth (2014) looks at the effect of a random cash transfer
program and shows that it leads to conspicuous consumption. However, even with `natu-
ral' experiments when the setting offers an enhanced strategy to identify peer effects, the
impossibility of controlling for all local or personal confounding factors does not provide
a clean identification strategy.
Another recent strand of literature uses the existence of partially overlapping groups
of peers to solve issues related to both reflection and correlated effects. The intuition is
that partially overlapping groups generate peers of peers (or excluded peers) who act as
instruments in the simultaneous equation model of social interactions and, thus, solve the
reflection problem (de Giorgi et al., 2010).
Something that has been rarely attempted so far when looking at peer effects is to
5
distinguish between the different reasons that cause individuals to behave in a similar
way to their peers. To our knowledge, this distinction has so far only been attempted by
using carefully designed experiments. Cai et al. (2009) look at an experiment with two
treatments in a restaurant setting in order to distinguish the effect of social learning from
the effect of salience. Burszytyn et al. (2014) study the demand for a complex financial
fund, using a brokerage firm in Brazil. The authors aim to distinguish between wanting
what others have and the information effect of knowing what the other person believes.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our
data and experimental design. Section 3 presents the conceptual framework. We discuss
descriptive statistics and group level results in Section 4. Section 5 provides individual
level results while further robustness tests are presented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.

2 Data
2.1 Household Survey Data and Sampling
Our peer experiment was conducted as part of the larger household survey of the research
project "Impact of shocks on the vulnerability to poverty: Consequences for development
of emerging Southeast Asian economies" funded by the German Research Foundation
which has been conducted in three Northeastern provinces of Thailand since 2007. The
household survey contains detailed information on many aspects of households' living stan-
dards including: household demographics, recurrent and durable expenditures, credit and
savings, landholdings, agriculture, employment, health, and education. It also includes
information concerning village characteristics such as the number of village institutions
or infrastructure (i.e. irrigation system, access to electricity, nurseries etc.), in - and out-
ward village migration, inhabitants, but also the number of shocks occurring in a village.
This data provides a representative sample of rural households in the Northeastern part
of Thailand.
The sampling procedure of rural households for the peer experiment conducted in
Ubon Ratchathani follows a three-stage stratified sampling procedure. It is important to
know that we exclude the urban area around the provincial capital city and confine the
sample to the remaining rural areas. In the first stage sub-districts within the province
were chosen with probability proportional to size and implicit stratification by population
density. In the second stage, from each sampled sub-district, two villages were sampled
randomly with probability of selection proportional to size. In the last step, in each of
those villages a systematic random sample of ten households was drawn to be interviewed
from the household lists of the rural census ordered by household size. To conclude, vil-
lages as well as respondents were randomly sampled for our peer experiment.
Our peer experiment was conducted in the largest of the three provinces, Ubon
Ratchathani. In addition to the experiment, we also collected a number of variables
to complement the socio-demographic variables collected during the household survey.
Questions designed to measure cognitive abilities were asked after the peer experiment.
We collected two types of questions (Details are reported in Appendix B). Firstly, we
collected a number of math based questions. In total there were six questions, the first
7
four are based on the hardest four out of eight math questions in Cole et al. (2011), the
last two questions are based on question used in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retire-
ment in Europe (SHARE). In addition, we included a question that asks respondents to
name as many animals as they can in 60 seconds. This is a measure of word fluency and
has the advantage that it is related to more innate forms of intelligence and especially
measures processing speed. This test for word fluency has also been used in a number of
other studies as part of cognitive ability measures such as Dohmen et al. (2010).
Finally, we ask respondents to judge how many of these questions they answered
correctly to measure overconfidence. Overconfidence results in unrealistically positive
self-evaluations. In other words, people are unrealistically optimistic and overestimate
personal success probabilities. Our primary measure of confidence is the difference be-
tween the predicted math score and the achieved score. Thus, a subject whose prediction
is higher than her actual score is called overconfident, and a subject whose prediction is
below her actual score is called underconfident.
2.2 Experimental Design
The peer experiment was conducted in August 2013 with a total of 521 respondents from
66 villages in Ubon Ratchathani. The experiment was performed three month after the
household survey.
The experiment was carried out by local enumerators with one of the co-authors being
present at all times. Instructions were translated from English into Thai and back, and
were cross-checked by a Thai economics professor to avoid semantic difficulties. Instruc-
tions were kept as simple as possible. The interviewers were trained in sessions that lasted
a total of five days. During these five days, a pilot study was conducted in three villages.
The experiment was conducted by visiting two villages per day; one in the morning
and one in the afternoon. For neighboring villages experiments were usually carried out
simultaneously. The distance between villages was on average 18 km and respondents
had to stay at the experimental site until the completion of the survey. There were two
experimental sessions conducted in each village, with up to five respondents in one session
at the same time. All experimental sessions took place in the village hall.
8
The experiment consists of a very simple choice task that required no previous knowl-
edge, was easy to implement and to measure in the field with a rural sample (see Ap-
pendix A for detailed instructions). The respondent has to choose between the tasty
treat and a certain amount of money. In the first round, for instance, the enumerator
asks respondents whether they would like to choose the tasty treat or 10 THB. Respon-
dents have to express their choices to their assigned enumerator. Once the respondent
has decided in each round, the enumerator moves to the next round. Now the respondent
has to choose between the tasty treat and 20 THB. Since we have seven rounds, in the
last round the respondent has to choose between the tasty treat and 70 THB. In order to
make the experiment as easy to follow for respondents as possible, we use showcards that
display the amount of money they can chose. The tasty treat is also placed directly in
front of the respondent. In round four there is no price difference between the two choices.
After round four, it becomes increasingly unreasonable to choose the tasty treat because
of the significant price difference. The enumerator marks the decision in each round. We
did allow switching back and forth. There were 24 respondents who switched twice and
were dropped in later analysis.
Before the experiment, respondents were asked to estimate the price of the tasty treat.
After their prediction, all respondents were told that the tasty treat costs 40 Baht in order
to avoid information asymmetries concerning the value of the product.
Another important component of our experiment was that they could receive the tasty
treat right after the experiment while they had to wait for the money until the end of
the session, thus enhancing temptation. Time-discounting factors can largely be ignored
since the experiment, including post-experiment questions, only took between one to two
hours to complete. Respondents were also reminded that they had to stay and answer
further questions (risk attitude, financial literacy, overconfidence and cognitive ability)
after the experiment.
The tasty treat consists of very popular items that are widely known across the coun-
try - a can of coke, a piece of custard cake, a small package of lays classic crisps, a bar of
chocolate, and a small pack of candies. It had a value of 40 Thai Baht (THB) (approxi-
mately 1 Euro). We made sure that it not only included sweet but also savory items so
that it appeals to a wider range of tastes. During the experiment, we made sure that the
9
respondents did not get any food or sweet beverages to drink.
Once all seven choices have been made, one decision was randomly played out by pick-
ing a number between 1 and 7 from a non-transparent bag. In case the respondent picked
number 3 and chose the tasty treat in row 3, she received the tasty treat immediately. In
case, the respondent picked money in that row, the respondent would receive 30 Baht at
the end of the survey with an additional 50 Baht for participating in the survey. After the
experiment, respondents were asked how much he/she would be willing to pay at most to
receive the tasty treat.
For practical reasons we randomized into treatment and control group on the village
level. Hence in control villages respondents played alone i.e. without peer observation,
while in treatment villages respondents played in close proximity with peer observation.
In the control group, the tasty treat game was played individually and was conducted
with 261 individuals in 66 groups. To avoid peer observation, we made sure that respon-
dents were separated across the town hall so that they could neither hear nor see the
choices of the other respondents. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the decisions of one
respondent affects other respondents in the control group because individuals respond at
different speeds.
The peer treatment was conducted with 260 individuals in 60 groups. The size of the
group ranges from three to five people. The procedure of the treatment is the same as
in the individual treatment with the sole exception that decisions were conducted with
peer observation. Each respondent is still responsible for their own decision, but they
have to sit next to each other and perform the experiment. As in the control group, all
the instructions were read out loud and showcards were used to demonstrate the possible
choices between tasty treat and money in each round. Enough tasty treats were on dis-
play, so that each respondent can see that there are enough for everyone to chose. The
principal enumerator would read out the instructions. In each round each respondent
would announce their choice out loud and the enumerator assigned to them would mark
their choice. After all respondents have made their choice, the group moves on to the next
round. There is no particular order in which respondents have to answer. We allowed
everyone to answer in their own time.
Given our experimental design, we cannot observe an order in which participants an-
10
swer. What we can observe, however, is whether the spatial proximity of the peer in
conjunction with their announcement of the decision to the group affects consumption
choices of the individual. The difference between the treatment and the control group is
simply that choices are observable to peers.
Given our random assignment of individuals to play the game alone or in a group, we
are able to create counterfactual groups out of those individuals that played the game at
the same time as their peers, but without directly observing their peers. We have two
types of groups, those that performed the experiment directly observing each other and
those that played the game at the same time in the same room, but not directly observing
each other. Hence the only difference between our treatment and control group is that
the treatment group observed their peers and the control group did not. Any difference
in group outcomes can therefore be attributed to the only difference - peer observation.
2.3 Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 shows individual characteristics of our sample. First, we have significantly more
women in our sample (60%). As we are deliberately sampling the household head, average
age is relatively high at 54 years and 83% of respondents are married. Socio-demographic
characteristics of our sample are typical for rural northern Thailand; education levels
are still relatively low with less than six years on average. The average household has
more than four members with a dependency ratio of 1.48 dependents for every working
member. The vast majority of respondents name farming as their main occupation, with
the rest being made up of government officials, business owners, students and housewives.
As this study uses eatable goods to examine the consumption of temptation goods, it
is interesting to look at BMI, a standardized measure of weight to height ratio. The
average in our sample is 23 which is the normal BMI range according to the WHO. In
terms of village characteristics, the average distance to the next district capital and to
the provincial capital, Ubon, is 16 km and 60 km respectively. This is important to
know and to control for because the demand for the temptation good may be larger the
further the distance of the village to the nearest town. The average number of shocks in
our 66 villages was 1.45 ranging from 1 to 3 shocks in total. The number of households
11
in a village varies significantly from 813 households close to the provincial capital to 55
households only which has also the highest distance to the provincial capital Ubon. Peer
effects may be larger the smaller the village is because people may know each other better.
Despite considerable growth in rural Thailand over the last decades, the north east is still
relatively poor which is reflected in the average rate of consumption and average household
wealth.
In addition to standard socio-demographic variables, we also collected a number of
variables that are designed to measure cognitive ability. This allows us to study the peer
effect on a sample with different levels of cognitive ability. Firstly, we collected a number
of math based questions. In a first step, we awarded one point for each question answered
correctly. The average score achieved is 3.6 out of six. Numeracy shows a near normal
distribution with 1.99% scoring no point and only 4.81% scoring full six points. Second,
we asked respondents to name as many animals as they can in 60 seconds. The average
number of animals named is 17.2; however the standard deviation for this measure is rather
large at 6.86. The correlation between the two cognitive ability measures, numeracy test
and word fluency is 0.355 (Spearman; p-value<0.001). Thus, the two tests capture a
similar underlying trait but also distinct aspects of cognitive ability. Third, we follow the
same procedure as Dohmen et al. (2010) and use a single combined measure of cognitive
ability.
Finally, we also measure overconfidence of our respondents to see whether over and
underconfident respondents are more susceptible to peer effects. We define a subject whose
math prediction is higher than his/her actual score as overconfident, and a subject whose
prediction is below her actual score is called underconfident. Using this measure, 37% of
our sample are overconfident while 33% are underconfident. Overconfidence is positively
correlated with the lowest 10% of the cognitive ability test (0.26, p-value<0.001). In
contrast, the correlation between high cognitive skills (highest 10%) and underconfidence
are 0.09 with a p-value of 0.001.
Table 2 shows results of our paired t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test to check for
differences between treatment and control groups. It shows that randomization was mostly
successful and that there are no significant differences in observables between those that
played the tasty treat game alone and those that played the game with peer observation.
12
The only difference that can be seen is that those played in a group have on average more
children which is statistically significant in the t-test and in the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
The distance to Ubon, the provincial capital, is also larger in the control group, according
to both tests. We will control for this difference in further analysis.
As this study not only compares the behavior of individuals but also looks at the
behavior of groups, it is important to check that group composition is the same between
those that played in observing and non-observing groups. There are 126 groups in total.
60 groups are observing group, while the rest played in non-observing group. Table 3
shows that group composition stays mostly the same on average when looking at measured
observables. In line with Table 2, Table 3 shows that on average respondents assigned
to the treatment group have a higher number of children, which is significantly different
for both the t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We control for possible confounding
effects in later regressions.

3 Conceptual Framework
In this section we present our conceptual framework that explores the relationship between
the choice of money m, the individual choice of a tasty treat tt and the group's choice of
¯
tt. In this section, we ignore the effect of individual preferences as denoted by x and ¯
x
later on in this paper. We can justify this as we are conducting an experiment and due to
personal preferences being the same across treatments. Hence each participant's utility
function is defined as:
U(tt, m; D, ¯
tt) = u(tt, m) - D · c(tt - ¯
tt)
The first component u(tt, m) is both increasing and concave in both tt and m. It
represents the utility that an individual receives from choosing the tt or m, whereas the
choice in tt  {0, 1} and m  {10, ..., 70}. Because individuals have to decide between tt
and m, tt = 1 implies m = 0 and m > 0 implies tt = 0. Also note that the difference
u(0, m) - u(1, 0) is increasing in m: the higher m, the smaller the share of individuals
that will prefer tasty treatment to money, i.e.
Pr(tt m|D)
m
< 0.
The utility function above includes a conformity cost function c(tt- ¯
tt)  0. This cost
function is increasing, the larger the difference between own choice tt of the respondent
and average consumption of the peer group ¯
tt.
c(tt - ¯
tt)





> 0 if tt = ¯
tt
= 0 if tt = ¯
tt
In this model we do not go into the source of this cost. In our view there could be
a number of reasons behind this, which we discuss later on. More importantly note that
this conformity cost only applies to those individuals that play in a group. In the case of
the experiment in the control group D = 0, the conformity cost function should not play
14
a role. In single treatment, the tt is preferred if
u(1, 0) > u(0, m).
In the group treatment, tt is chosen if
u(1, 0) - c(1 - ¯
tt) > u(0, m) - c(0 - ¯
tt).
As participants possess the same utility function U(), average peer tasty treat con-
sumption ¯
tt must also be decreasing in m. Therefore, c(1-¯
tt)
m
> 0 and c(0-¯
tt)
m
< 0. In
other words the conformity cost of choosing tt increases the larger m is. It should be
noted that ¯
tt also depends on tt and is therefore endogenous. Since choosing the tt is
synonymous with not choosing m, it is easier to think of a cost function that looks at the
cost of choosing tt at different levels of m. In this case the cost of choosing tt would be
positive for high values of m, but negative for low m. Figure 1 shows the relationship
between m, Pr(tt) and c(1 - ¯
tt).

At point E the conformity cost for those that played with peer observation is 0. They,
therefore, make the same decision on average as those that play without peer observation.
It becomes clear from Figure 1 that the respondents under peer treatment react more
strongly to a change in m than respondents under single treatment
Pr(tt m|D = 0)
m
<
Pr(tt m|D = 1)
m
.
Intuitively, this seems logical as there in an extra benefit from choosing the tt when m
is small and an extra cost in choosing tt when m is large. This means that in the peer
treatment, we expect that fewer people switch from m to tt at an early or late stage. In
turn, we expect this to lower standard deviation within a group. So far we have shown the
different reactions of tt to a change in m, between the peer and the single treatment. We
now need to show that the aforementioned conformity cost leads to a positive relationship
between tt and ¯
tt which can be defined as peer effects. From the original utility function
16
we can see that
Pr(tt m|D = 0)
 ¯
tt
= 0
Hence there is no change in tt as ¯
tt change in the single treatment. Whereas under peer
treatment
Pr(tt m|D = 1)
 ¯
tt
> 0
There is a positive relationship between the number of people that choose tt and the
average peer decision ¯
tt.
As previously mentioned there are two conclusions that rise from including a confor-
mity cost function into a standard utility function. Firstly, as there is a cost involved with
not doing what everyone also is doing, we expect there to be fewer extreme choices under
peer observation. At the same time, we expect there to be a clear positive relationship
between tt and ¯
tt when the experiment is performed under peer observation, but not when
the experiment is performed alone.

4 Group Level Results
4.1 Comparing Groups
We begin our analysis of the effects of peer observation by studying the difference between
those groups that played the game observing each other and those that played the game
at the same time and under the same conditions but not observing each other. T-tests
and Wilcoxon-rank test compare decisions between the two types of groups in Table 4.
At first, it seems that there is no difference in the mean group choice of the last row that
was chosen in each playing situation. Hence, the average last row chosen in observing as
well as non-observing groups is the same.
However, we can see a difference in the standard deviation between those groups that
played together and those that did not. The standard deviation within a group for those
groups that observed each other is significantly lower than for those groups that did not
observe each other. Those that play in the observing group are less likely to switch either
very early or very late. This can also be seen when looking at the group minimum and
the group maximum. The group minimum is the lowest switching point of anyone within
the group, whereas the group maximum is the highest switching point within a group.
We can see that the group minimum is significantly higher and the group maximum is
significantly lower when the game is played with peers observing each other.
The finding is further supported by Figure 2 which shows a kernal density plot of
mean group choices for observing and non-observing groups. Here we can see that mean
group choices take both higher and lower values when the game is played without peer
observation. The kernal density function also shows that the standard deviation is lower
in observing groups.
We further test the finding described above using regression analysis whilst controlling
for group composition in Table 5. Outcome variables stay the same as above, namely
group mean, group minimum, group maximum, and group standard deviation. The peer
dummy is unity if the group played with peer observation. In these regressions we control
for group level mean characteristics. We confirm our finding from above. When the ex-
periment is played with peer observation, standard deviation of choices within the group
is lower. The same can be seen when looking at the group minimum and maximum. The
18
coefficient on the peer dummy is positive in the regression estimating the group minimum
and negative and significant in the regression estimating the group maximum. Interest-
ingly, group composition seems to have only a limited influence on the tasty treat choice.
Groups with more women switch from tasty treat to money earlier. Similarly, there seems
to be an effect of groups that are richer, i.e. that have higher average consumption. Both
Table 4 and Table 5 show that there is a significant difference in consumption choices
between observing and non-observing groups. We find that consumption choices converge
in the observing groups. Hence, there is evidence for conformity when respondents ob-
serve each other.
Performing the experiment in a group seems to effect those that would have chosen
the money early on or stuck with the tasty treat until very late the most. This can
be seen in more detail in Table 6. Here we again use t-test and Wilcoxon-rank tests
to compare deciles between observing and non-observing groups. We can see that the
first and second decile in observing groups is higher than the non-observing groups. The
opposite can be seen when looking at the eighth and ninth decile. This is significantly
higher in non-observing groups than in observing groups. This effect is stronger for the
higher deciles. Of course, one cannot directly compare individuals, as no one performs
the experiment in the treatment and in the control group, but from this it looks like peer
observation particularly effects those that would have made extreme choices.
4.2 Giving in to Temptation?
We here briefly discuss our respondent's propensity to give in to temptation. This ex-
periment was deliberately performed using temptation goods, as evidence suggests that
demand for these goods is more likely to be influenced by the presence of peers. At
the same time, we believe that playing the game with temptation goods and hence non-
essential good gives cleaner evidence of the effect of peer observation. It is possible that
playing the game with other goods that can be considered neccessities, would have had a
confounding effect on choices made by individuals.
We here define giving in to temptations as choosing the tasty treat far beyond its
value of 40 Baht. From the tables discussed above and especially from Figure 2 we can
19
see that giving in to temptation does not happen a lot. Indeed, the mean of the aver-
age group choice for both the treatment and control group is just below three, meaning
that the average respondent switches from the amount of money offered well below the
purchasing value of the tasty treat. The same applies to median choice, which lies just
below three for both the treatment and the control group. Moreover, when looking at
Figure 2, it becomes clear that there is considerable variation between choices made.
Some group average choices are below the point whereas some are far above the point
where the amount offered is equal to the money. From here we can clearly see that some
people do give in to temptation, but also that peer observation seems to prevent people
from giving in to temptation. However, peer observation not only reduces the switching
point of those that would otherwise have given in to temptation, but it also raises the
switching point of those that would have switched very early. Therefore, our results are
caused by conformity to the group, and less likely by peer observation preventing people
from giving in to temptation.
20
5 Individual Level Results
5.1 Identification Strategy
We are interested in identifying causal peer effects on the individual decision-making and
understanding whether consumption is affected by the observation of peers. The iden-
tification of peer effects, however, suffers from a number of econometric issues (Manski,
1993; Moffit, 2001) which can be summarized into three categories: (a) correlated effects,
(b) contextual effects, and (c) endogenous effects.
Correlated effects in consumption choices may emerge if socially-related individuals
under study share preferences and characteristics that make them more likely to select into
a peer group and these characteristics are important determinants of the dependent vari-
able. This means that peer groups that have evolved naturally are therefore more similar
to each other than if they had been chosen randomly. This may lead to the appearance to
peer effects, but in reality those observed are simply behaving similarly because they are
similar. Contextual effects may emerge if individuals share common environments and
unobserved shocks (i.e. rainfall in the village) that make their consumption move simul-
taneously independently of any genuine peer effects. These are sometimes also referred
to as time-variant unobservables, while correlated effects are referred to as time invariant
observables. Finally, endogenous effects represent the phenomenon where the group af-
fects individual behavior through social interaction (i.e. is the individual's consumption
choice affected by the group consumption choice). It is the third effect what we are trying
to separate in this study.
Our experimental design (discussed in detail in Section 2) represents an attempt to
surmount the challenge of identifying a causal peer effect. Much of the literature follow-
ing Manski has focused on the econometric issue of separating the causal peer effect from
that of correlated unobservables (Miguel and Kremer, 2004; Bandiera and Rasul, 2006;
Conley and Udry, 2010). Two ways of disentangling these effects are to (1) randomize
the peers (Sacerdote, 2001; Duflo and Saez, 2003) or (2) randomize an intervention or
new technology (Kremer and Miguel, 2007; Oster and Thornton, 2012; Godlonton and
Thornton, 2012). We follow the first approach.
The double randomization in our experimental design, that is, first randomly select-
21
ing households to perform the experiment given the sampling procedure and second ran-
domizing peer and control treatments according to villages, circumvents the problem of
correlated effects.
Since we chose randomly who plays in a peer group and who is part of that peer group,
there are unlikely to be any unobservables that would systematically influence the choices
made by the individual. Hence we can circumvent the problem of correlated effects. At
the same time, our experiment takes place in a relatively controlled environment and
only takes a short period of time. It is, hence, unlikely that unobservable time-variant
characteristics influence decisions made by respondent.
For the identification of endogenous peer effects we use the so-called leave-out mean
as the regressor in our main analysis in order to analyze the effect of the group average
consumption on the individual consumption choice.2
To identify the effect of peer observation, we will estimate the main regression model
in the following form using least squares estimation:
Yij
= ¯
y-i,j
+ ¯
x-i,j
+ xi,j
+ ui,j
In our framework, Yij
is the consumption choice of tasty treat for individual i who has
group affiliation j (observing or non-observing group). In our main analysis Yij
will be
the last row in which they choose the tasty treat before switching to money. However,
we also run similar regressions using a variable that is one if participants always chose
tasty treat over money or if they decided not to choose tasty treat at all. The coefficient
of interest is , the coefficient on the group mean. This is the group outcome net of
individual i's outcome, a quantity commonly referred to as the leave-out mean. In our
analysis we split the sample into those that performed the experiment in observing and
non-observing groups. We expect  to be positive when the experiment is performed with
peer observation and so indicating positive peer effects. When the experiment is, on the
other hand, performed without peer observation we expect  to be close to 0. This will
indicate to us that we are really observing endogenous peer effects that are not caused by
correlated or contextual effects.
2While we are able to identify endogenous peer effects, we are not able to circumvent the reflection
problem entirely.
22
In many peer studies, researchers would often use the group mean inclusive of the in-
dividual, ¯
yij
. However, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, because regressing
¯
yij
on yij
results in a coefficient of 1, entering unity. Therefore, any peer group measure
must vary within groups in order to satisfy the rank condition. This would rule out tak-
ing the average outcome of the group as the regressor. Instead taking the leave-out mean
allows inter-group correlation coefficients since there is a different group average for each
respondent, calculated from the decision of the other group members. This approach has
previously been used by Townsend (1994), Guryan et al. (2009), Duflo et al. (2011),
Carrell et al. (2012) and advocated by Angrist (2014).
Following this, we include the variable ¯
x-i,j
which is the vector of average group
socio-economic characteristics in group j, excluding the individual i. A set of individual
characteristics such as female, age, schooling, log consumption, household size, depen-
dency ratio, and BMI that may affect consumption decisions compose xi,j
. The error
term uij
is clustered on the village level.
As we assign respondents randomly into peers groups, we assume E(uij
|xij
) = 0, i.e.,
no correlated effects or self-selection into groups. Thus, if we observe a difference in out-
comes between observing and non-observing groups we can attribute this directly to the
(on average) only difference between these groups, namely peer observation.
5.2 Peer Effects
As a next step we look at peer effects and their effect on individual decisions as described
in the previous section. We find an effect of the group average on the individual decision-
making concerning consumption choice. We here perform the regression described above.
Results are presented in Table 7, Panel A. The first two columns cover the entire sample.
We find that there is a significant and positive relationship between the average switching
point in the group and individual's switching point. When looking at these results only,
however, it is conceivable that this relationship may be caused by unobserved variables
as described by Manski (1993).
In the next four columns, however, we split out sample into those that played the game
in observing groups and those that played in non-observing groups (denoted as Peer and
Single). Here, we can clearly see that the effect observed above is caused by peers observ-
23
ing each other directly and not caused by unobserved correlated or contextual variables.
In columns 3 and 4 we show results for those individuals that played in observing groups
with and without control variables. We can see that the effect here is significant and
stronger than for the full subject pool. The coefficient of interest only reduces slightly
when we introduce the control variables. The only other significant relationship we find
is the difference between males and females. Females seem to choose the tasty treat less
compared to men. Columns 5 and 6 show the same regression but for respondents that
play the game without peer observation. Here the effect of the average peer choice has
no effect on the individual's switching row. Similarly, in column 7 we introduce an in-
teraction term between the group average and a dummy that takes the value one if the
game was played in an observing group. The interaction term is positive and significant
and so we can conclude that the relationship between the group average and the point of
switching is not the same between observing and unobserving groups.
These results in Table 7, Panel A, described above indicate to us that the peer
effects that we observe in columns 3 and 4 above, is not caused by unobserved correlated
or contextual variables but rather by peers observing each other and making the same
observation at the same time.
In Table 7, Panel B and Table 7, Panel C we perform the same exercise, but with
different dependent variables to see whether individuals consumption decision is still af-
fected by the group, even for those individuals that may lean towards extreme choices. In
Panel B we use a dependent term that is a dummy taking the value of 1 if the respondent
chooses the tasty treat in every round. In Panel C we also use an indicator variable that
is 1 if the respondent never chooses the tasty treat, hence preferring the money from row
1 until row 7. Both tables exhibit the same pattern as the previous table. The group?s
average consumption choice does influence the individual's choice in both tables. In Panel
B, for instance, it can be said that if the group consumption average increases in the peer
treatment, the more likely is the respondent to choose the tasty treat in every round.
These results are highly significant at the 1% significance level even when controlling
for observable factors. Noticeable is also the relative high R2. The socio-demographic
covariates plus the group average excluding the individual seem to explain a large share
of the variation in the dependent variable. Conversely in Panel C, we find that if the
24
group average is higher, it is less likely that the respondent never chooses the tasty treat.
Most importantly, all these relationships only holds if the decisions are made under peer
observation and does not hold if the game is played at the same time but without peer
observation. Hence, we find that observability of the behavior of peers leads to conforming
behavior, thus confirming the descriptive results in the previous section.
25
5.3 Mechanisms
So far, we have found strong evidence in consumption choices. We show that the standard
deviation of choices is smaller, the maximum switching row is lower and the minimum
switching point is higher if the experiment is conducted with peer observation. At the
same time, we were able to show that individuals are clearly influenced by their groups,
as group averages have an influence on the individual decision-making. However, it is not
clear what the source of this group conformity is.
In this section, we will now attempt to look into the mechanism that operates these
observed effects further. In the literature, a number of reasons behind peer effects are
discussed (Bikhchandani et al., 1998; Cai et al., 2009). We here attempt to look at two
factors. Firstly, peer effects have been argued to be caused by respondent's believe that
others have better information. Hence by doing what others are doing individuals are
drawing on their peer's information. Secondly, individuals could simply follow their peers
because they are gaining some kind of network externality or psychological benefit from
doing the same as others in their group. Due to the set up of our experiment, we are
unable to provide definite answers. Nonetheless, these results provide some interesting
insights into the mechanisms that are behind the observed conformity.
We will here firstly discuss the effect of information since peer effects have been exten-
sively examined in the context of informational spillovers (Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995;
Miguel and Kremer, 2004; Conley and Udry, 2010; Oster and Thornton, 2012). As de-
scribed above, we asked respondent to estimate how much the tasty treat costs to buy in
a shop. We use this response as a proxy for how familiar the respondents are with the
product. We create a dummy that is unity if the respondent wrongly estimates the price.
We introduce this dummy, together with an interaction term between the dummy and
the leave-out-mean into the regression as described above. Results are shown in Table 8.
Interestingly, unfamiliarity with the tasty treat makes the respondent less likely to choose
it, but only in the single treatment. Not knowing the price of a product has no effect
on the likelihood of choosing the tasty treat in the peer treatment. Hence, it seems that
individual's benefit from some kind of information tranfer or social learning by following
the group.
26
In order to look into the other possible reason behind this mechanism further, we look
at the decision of respondents to switch in a certain round, depending on the proportion
of his groups that has switched in a previous round. Table 9 shows results. The right
hand variable is a dummy that is one if the respondent switches from the tasty treat to the
money in a certain row. The dependent variable is the proportion that chose the money
i.e. had switched in previous rounds. Table 9 shows these regressions for both the single
and the peer treatment and for the decision taken in rounds up to round four. Since most
people only switch once, the regressions only include people that had not switched in
previous rounds. All regressions include individual level and group level control variables.
We can see from these regressions that the proportion of people that had switched in the
previous rounds has a positive effect on the likelihood that a respondent will switch from
TT to money in a given round. However, this relationship breaks down after round three,
possibly because the number of people that had not switched beforehand is very small.
Table 9 indicate that the number of people that decide to switch is important for the
decision made by the individual. It indicates that there is some kind of network exter-
nality at play here as it appears that people seem to benefit from doing the same as the
people in their group when playing with peer observation.
These results indicate that peer observation counteract the effect of a lack of informa-
tion on a product. It seems that individuals obtain some sort of information by observing
each other's actions. This way they are able to optimize self-interested behavior. Gaining
information from peers therefore seems to play a role in peer effects. At the same time,
we find evidence of people following each other. However, we cannot draw definite con-
clusions about the mechanism behind peer effects. Network externalities seem to play a
role here alongside information effects.
27
5.4 Treatment Heterogeneity
In this section, we test whether certain people are more likely to succumb to peer effects.
We here look at both behavioural types and the social environment in which people live to
see if some are more likely to conform than others. It is, for instance, conceivable that high
(low) cognitive ability individuals within their group are more able to resist (succumb) to
peer effects. There is a growing literature linking cognitive ability and financial literacy
to improved financial behaviors and outcomes (see for instance Agrawal and Mazumder,
2013; Bertrand and Morse, 2011). We hypothesize that high cognitive ability individuals
should be less prone to peer pressure while the opposite should be true for low skilled
respondents.
As discussed above we included a number of questions designed to study cognitive
ability. Now we create a dummy in our standard model for those that have the highest
and lowest cognitive ability score compared to their peers within the group to test the
effect of relative cognitive ability in a group. In order to test for the effect of absolute
cognitive ability we generate a dummy for those that scored in the highest 10% of the
distribution. We include these dummies together with an interaction term between the
dummy and the leave-out-mean into our regressions above using only the peer treatment.
As before standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the village level. Table 10 shows
results. We find that the high cognitive ability (both in relative term to their groups and
in absolute terms) individuals are less likely to succumb to peer effects. We, however, do
not find any statistically significant results for low cognitive ability people (results not
reported in the table).
We also investigate the effect of other personality traits. We use the same methods to
test whether overconfidence drives economic decision in our peer experiment. We hypoth-
esize that those who are overconfident may be less susceptible to peer effects. While we
do get the expected sign, that is to say, that overconfident people take tasty treat in later
rounds, the results are statistically insignificant. Hence, we do not find that overconfi-
dence matters in terms of peer decisions (Details upon request). We also use this method
to test whether those with the highest consumption are more susceptible to succumb to
peer effects. We do not find any significant results (Details upon request).
28
Another interesting question is whether people that live in closer knit communities are
more susceptible to peer effects. The conformity cost of not doing what everyone else in
the group is doing may be higher for those that live in communities with stronger social
ties. As there is no way of measuring this directly, we test to see if the peer effect is
stronger for those living in smaller villages. We hence create a dummy that is unity for
those respondents that live in villages that are smaller than the median. Again, we also
include an interaction term between this dummy and the leave out mean. Results are
shown in Table 10 in column five and six. We can see that the small village dummy as
well as the interaction term are significant. This shows us that those that live in smaller
villages are more likely to conform to the group. This indicates that stronger social ties
may lead to stronger conforming behavior.
29
6 Robustness
Strictly speaking it is conceivable that the peer effects that we observe earlier on are
not caused by peer effects since our randomization took place on the village level rather
than the individual level. This, however, seems very unlikely. For this to happen the
randomization would have to work in a way that those that played in observing groups
are more alike than those that played in the non-observing groups. Since the number
of groups is fairly large and we are also able to control for a large number of observable
factors, we believe that such a concern can be neglected. However, to exclude further
doubt, we test whether standard deviations of observed variables are the same between
observing and non-observing groups. Results are shown in Table 11. From the t-test
and Wilcoxon-rank test, we can see that standard deviations are the same for observing
and non-observing groups. We therefore reject the idea that our results are caused by
observing groups being more similar than non-observing groups.
In Table 3 we control for a large number of socio-demographic group means. Here we
also check if group standard deviations in socio-demographic characteristics may make
a difference to the effect of peer observation on group level results. It is possible that
groups that are similar (by coincidence) make more similar decisions. This is not the
case. Results stay the same when controlling for group level standard deviations in socio-
demographic variables.
Next, we also check if the main results hold when we change the way the dependent
variable is coded. In order to do this, we create two dummies. The first takes the value of
one if the respondent switched before the money amount increased to 40 Baht, the second
takes the value of one if the respondent switches after the money amount is increased to
40 Baht. We run all the regressions again and find that the results do not change. The
group average still has a significant effect on these outcome variables.
Furthermore, we check whether in addition to the distance of the villages to Ubon,
the provincial capital city, or the nearest district capital has an impact on the demand for
temptation goods since it is assumed that villages that are close to urban areas could get
the tasty treat more easily. This could determine the impact of peer effect. We do not
find that the distance to the provincial capital or the district capital has any impact on
30
the peer effects and results found in Table 7 stay the same. We also control for a number
of other village characteristics such as village shocks or their intensity. These also do not
seem to make a difference.
We also check whether there are further personal characteristics that may influence
the demand for the tasty treat and the strength of the peer effect. We check if those
that have particularly high food consumption, low consumption or high consumption are
more likely to choose the tasty treat in higher rounds. This may either indicate being
particularly rich or poor or alternatively, those with high food consumption may have
a particular high demand for food. We find no effects using any of these consumption
variables. We also include an interaction term between the female dummy and the leave
out mean to see if peer effects are stronger for men or women. We find no effect.
In the next step, we test whether our results may be driven by one or several settings
of the experiment. We firstly investigate whether morning or afternoon sessions would
have a confounding effect on the demand of consumption good. We create an dummy
variable for the morning session and interaction terms thereof with the group average
excluding the individual and include this in our regression analysis (see Table 12). We
only look at those that played in observing peer groups. We find that there is no difference
between results the game is played in the morning. Hence, main results of Table 7, Panel
A, remain unchanged. It is interesting to see whether the experimental session influences
the results. In each village, we played two sessions. We find that whether the experiment
was performed in the first or the second session does not make a difference to the results
(see Table 12). Taking the entire or merely the observing groups, we find that regardless
whether one group played before the other, peer observation seems to have an impact
on the consumption choice of the individual. Lastly, most of our groups contained five
people, however it was not always possible. We also check if group size has an effect on
our results. In order to this we exclude all groups that did not contain five people. Again,
we find that results do not change.
Overall, our results seem robust to a large number of alterations and controls to out-
come variables, village charactersitics, individual charactersitics and experimental design.

7 Conclusion
In a standard economic model of consumption choice, the effect of peers is largely ignored.
Our study shows that peer observation has an effect on consumption of temptation goods.
We conduct a lab-in-field experiment and find that peer observation leads to conformity.
We start by introducing a conceptual framework that introduces a cost if the individ-
ual makes a decision that deviates from that of the group. From this framework we can
see that the demand function of the temptation good is less steep under peer observation.
We can also derive a positive relationship between the average group choice and the indi-
vidual choice.
The data supports the predictions of the conceptual framework. Due to the experimen-
tal nature and the large number of control variables, we can circumvent the identification
problems normally associated in studies on peer effects. In the control group, respon-
dents perform the experiment at the same time as their peers but without observing each
other. In the treatment group, peers still make individual choices, but observe each other
whilst doing it. We find that standard deviations of those groups that observe each other
are lower than for those groups that do not observe each other. At the same time, we
show that individual choices are higher when the group choice, measured as the leave-out
group mean, is higher. Most importantly, we only observe this when the experiment is
performed with peer observations. Hence, we provide clear evidence of peer effects and
conclude that peer observation leads to conformity.
This finding is in line with Falk and Ichino (2006) who find that the standard deviation
of output of subjects in pairs is statistically significantly lower that in the single treat-
ment. It also corresponds to theoretical models of herding (Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani
et al., 1992). The direction of our effects is in line with those of Bandiera et al.(2010),
Bursztyn et al. (2014) and de Giorgi et al. (2010) for positive and significant peer effects
on individual behavior.
In further analysis we look into the possible mechanism behind this conformity. We
study the effect of familiarity with the product and find that peer observation can coun-
teract the effect of a lack of knowledge of a product. We also find some evidence that
respondents follow the choices of their peer group. Finally, we investigate treatment het-
32
erogeneities in order to see if the tendency to conform is stronger for some behavioral
traits or environments. We find that individuals with high cognitive ability, are less likely
to choose the tasty treat, while the same effect is not to be found for overconfident or
high-income individuals. We also find evidence that those that live in closer knit commu-
nities are more likely to succumb to peer effects.
Despite these findings, a lot of open questions remain that call for further research
into peer effects and its effect on consumption choices. So far, there is no consensus on
the "best" method to identify peer effects, in part because models and methods must
necessarily be case-specific. However, understanding the complexity of peer effects seems
yet to be insufficiently explored. Furthermore, more research is needed that looks into
the mechanisms behind peer effects and what leads to conformity. In more detail, a
structured experiment may be able to disentangle the effect of information and network
externality and so explain why we find this conformity when peers observe each other. In
addition, research should be done into the effect of key individuals within a group, that
is to investigate who leads a group and who in a group follows. Another open question is
whether peer effects as they are found in this experiment would persist beyond the time
of observation.

A Appendix
Experimental Instructions
We would now like to play a game with you in which you have to choose between some
tasty goods or money. At the end of the game you can keep either the tasty goods or
the money. We will ask you to choose between the two options 7 times. Each time we
ask you, we increase the amount of money. The amount of tasty goods will always be
the same. The enumerator will write down your choice each time we ask you. After the
game, we will draw a number from a bag. This determines which of the two options you
get. The tasty good will be given to you straight after the game. The money, however,
will be given to you at the end of the whole survey. You will only receive one option.
Either money or tasty good.
Example: No.3 is drawn from the bag. For the third decision you chose the tasty
treat, so you will get the tasty treat immediately. Enumerator put tasty good on the table.
Enumerator will present the tasty good and ask the following question. Please esti-
mate the price of the tasty treat in the market.
Price of tasty treat (THB)
Enumerator tells respondent that the price of the tasty present is THB 40 and put up
the sign that shows the price.
