PRACTICE OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
Factors Associated with Discrepancies between Self-Reports on Cigarette
Smoking and Measured Serum Cotinine Levels among Persons Aged 17
Years or Older
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988­1994

The discrepancy between cigarette smoking status reported during an interview and measured level of serum
cotinine, a nicotine biomarker, was investigated in a representative sample of the US population aged 17 years
(N = 15,357). Data were collected from participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (1988­1994). Among self-reported smokers, 7.5% (95% confidence interval: 6.3, 8.7) had a serum
cotinine level less than or equal to 15.0 ng/ml, the selected cutoff point for identifying nonsmokers. Age (p <
0.01), race/ethnicity (p < 0.01), and average number of cigarettes smoked per day (p < 0.01) were associated
with these discrepant findings. Among self-reported nonsmokers, 1.4% (95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.7) had
a serum cotinine level greater than 15.0 ng/ml, the selected cutoff point for identifying smokers. Race/ethnicity
(p < 0.01), education (p < 0.01), number of household members who smoked in the home (p = 0.03), and self-
reported smoking status from an earlier home interview (p < 0.01) were associated with these discrepant
findings. Differences in smoking patterns, including the extent of nicotine dosing, may explain most of the
discrepancy observed among self-reported smokers, whereas deception regarding smoking status may explain
most of the discrepancy among self-reported nonsmokers. This study provides evidence that self-reported
smoking status among adult respondents to a population-based survey conducted in a private medical setting
is accurate. Am J Epidemiol 2001;153:807­14.

Studies collecting data on cigarette smoking typically rely
on participants' reports of their smoking status. Such self-
reports may be suspect, however, because participants may
be unwilling to admit to a health or social behavior that
many perceive to be undesirable. Studies comparing self-
reported smoking status with concentrations of biochemical
markers of tobacco consumption (e.g., nicotine, cotinine,
carbon monoxide, carboxyhemoglobin, and thiocyanate)
have generally found self-reports to be good indicators of
actual smoking status (1­5), although in some populations
self-reports may underestimate the actual prevalence of cig-
arette smoking by up to 4 percent (1, 2, 6). Factors that may
affect the accuracy of self-reports include age (7), race/
ethnicity (2, 3, 8), education (2, 3), smoking history (2), and
the presence or absence of a disease known to be linked with
smoking (9). Identifying factors that contribute to misclassi-
fication of self-reported smokers and nonsmokers could
allow more accurate estimates of smoking prevalence.
Biochemical markers of tobacco consumption vary in sen-
sitivity (biochemical measures lose sensitivity at lower levels
of smoking), specificity, and difficulty of analysis (3­5,
10­12). Overall, studies comparing nonsmokers (exposed or
unexposed to environmental tobacco smoke) with active
smokers (13­19) have consistently found that measurement
of cotinine in serum can distinguish active smokers from non-
smokers. However, the concentration distributions for occa-
sional smokers and nonsmokers exposed to environmental
tobacco smoke have been found to overlap (20), exposing one
limitation of the use of serum cotinine concentration as a gold
standard. Nicotine is the best marker of tobacco exposure,
because this biomarker is relatively unique to tobacco, but its
half-life is short (2­3 hours) (21). Cotinine is a primary
metabolite of nicotine, and it has an average half-life of 18­20
hours (21); thus, it can be used to accurately assess a person's
exposure to tobacco--whether through passive exposure (i.e.,
to environmental tobacco smoke) or through active use.
Indeed, serum cotinine concentration has been widely used as
808 Caraballo et al.

a biomarker in studies assessing exposure to tobacco (20,
22­27). The National Center for Environmental Health
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) recently devel-
oped a highly sensitive measurement method for detecting
serum cotinine concentrations as low as 0.05 ng/ml (28).
We explored in depth discrepancies between self-reported
smoking status and measured serum cotinine concentrations.
We used data collected from persons aged 17 years or older in
the United States who participated in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
NHANES III was a nationwide household survey that
collected health and nutritional information from a repre-
sentative sample of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized
population aged 2 months or older (29). The survey, which
was conducted from 1988 to 1994, consisted of an interview
carried out in the participant's home (including questions on
tobacco use and exposure), followed by a standardized
physical examination and an additional questionnaire on
tobacco use administered in specially equipped mobile
examination centers (MECs).
Subject selection
In NHANES III, 24,230 persons aged 17 years or older
were selected to participate in the survey; 4,180 refused the
interview, and 2,345 were interviewed at home but did not visit
the MEC. For our study, we excluded 2,348 persons because
they either did not answer the questionnaire on tobacco use,
had no cotinine measurement, or reported having had exposure
to significant sources of nicotine other than cigarettes in the
previous 5 days. Thus, our study consisted of 15,357 persons
aged 17 years or older. Children and adolescents aged 8­16
years were excluded because of methodological issues in using
biomarkers to assess active smoking among persons initiating
or experimenting with cigarette use (7).
Demographic classification
Demographic information was collected during the in-home
interview. We classified our study participants by sex, age
(17­24, 25­44, 45­64, or 65 years), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, or Mexican-American),
marital status (married or not married), and education (0­8,
9­11, 12, or 13 completed years of schooling). Poverty status
was based on a measure developed by the US Census Bureau
(30) in which members of families having annual incomes
equal to or greater than the poverty threshold were categorized
as "at or above poverty level" and those having annual
incomes below the poverty threshold were categorized as
"below poverty level." Body mass index, which is commonly
used to assess obesity, was computed as body weight (in kilo-
grams) divided by the square of height (in meters). Obesity
was defined as a body mass index of 30.0 or higher (31, 32).
For determination of environmental tobacco smoke expo-
sure in the home, one member of the household (usually the
head of the family or his/her spouse) was asked, "Does anyone
who lives here smoke cigarettes in the home?" If the answer
was yes, the interviewer asked who it was. When that house-
hold member was identified, every other member of the house-
hold was classified as being exposed to environmental tobacco
smoke at home. We categorized the number of household mem-
bers who smoked cigarettes at home as zero, one, or two or
more. One of the family members was asked how many rooms
were in the home, excluding bathrooms. We categorized the
number of rooms as 1­4 rooms and five or more rooms.
We created a variable to capture the presence of a
tobacco-related disease. Participants who reported that they
had ever been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, a heart
attack, congestive heart failure, emphysema, chronic bron-
chitis, or a smoking-related cancer were categorized as hav-
ing a smoking-related disease. All others were categorized
as not having such a disease.
Participants who reported having a job or business were
asked how many hours per day they were close enough to
tobacco smoke at work that they could smell the smoke. We
classified the number of hours exposed to environmental
tobacco smoke at work as 0, 1­3, and 4 or more hours.
An average of 2 weeks elapsed from the time of the in-
home interview to the time of physical examination and
administration of the additional tobacco-use questionnaire.
To take into account potential changes in smoking status
between the household interview and the medical examina-
tion, we created a variable in which participants were iden-
tified as never, former, or current smokers by their smoking
status in the household interview. In the household ques-
tionnaire, respondents were asked if they had smoked at
least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. Those who
answered "no" were classified as never smokers. Those who
answered "yes" were then asked if they were currently
smoking cigarettes. Respondents who answered "no" to this
question were classified as former smokers, and respondents
who answered "yes" were classified as current smokers.
Cigarette smoking status
The tobacco-use questionnaire, administered by an inter-
viewer in the MEC, asked participants, "How many cigarettes
have you smoked in the past 5 days?" In our study, we defined
smokers as persons who reported smoking at least one ciga-
rette in the previous 5 days. We calculated the average num-
ber of cigarettes smoked per day for those who had smoked
one cigarette or more in the previous 5 days. In this study, we
refer to nonsmokers as persons who reported that they had not
smoked during the 5 days prior to the MEC interview. This
study did not use a "bogus pipeline" strategy to increase the
accuracy of self-reports; however, given that the NHANES III
survey was not tobacco-specific, each participant was informed
that his or her blood specimen was going to be tested for
numerous components (i.e., hematologic assessments, dietary
intake, biochemistry profile, cotinine level, and other factors).
Serum cotinine measurement
Biochemical determination of tobacco exposure was per-
formed by measuring serum cotinine level in blood speci-
Self-Reports on Smoking vs. Serum Cotinine Levels 809

mens obtained by venipuncture in the MEC. The biochemi-
cal assay involved isotope dilution, liquid chromatography,
and tandem mass spectrometry (28).
In a previous analysis of NHANES III data, Pirkle et al.
(20) found that for respondents aged 4 years or older, serum
cotinine level was bimodally distributed for tobacco users
and nonusers, with little overlap. This separation occurred at
a level of approximately 10.0­15.0 ng/ml. Thus, we decided
to use a cotinine cutoff point of >15.0 ng/ml to designate
smokers and 15.0 ng/ml to designate nonsmokers.
Statistical analysis
Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the rela-
tions between serum cotinine level and self-reported smok-
ing status. Two types of models based on different subsets of
the NHANES III data were estimated. We fitted a model
using data from all respondents who indicated in the MEC
interview that they were smokers--i.e., that they had
smoked at least one cigarette during the previous 5 days.
The binary outcome for this model was set equal to 1 if a
respondent was biochemically classified as a nonsmoker
(serum cotinine level 15.0 ng/ml). The second model was
based on data from all respondents who indicated in the
MEC interview that they were nonsmokers--i.e., that they
had not smoked during the previous 5 days. The binary out-
come for this second model was set equal to 1 if a respon-
dent was biochemically classified as a smoker (serum coti-
nine level >15.0 ng/ml).
We included in the logistic regression models variables to
account for the stratification and multistage design of
NHANES III. All logistic model parameters were estimated
using SUDAAN (33). Survey weights were used to account
for different probabilities of selection within strata.
The covariates included those shown in tables 4 and 5.
Additional covariates that we examined and rejected
included poverty status, obesity, exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke at work, and number of rooms in the house.
For self-reported smokers, number of cigarettes smoked per
day was categorized in various ways. Our final categoriza-
tion was an attempt to make the analysis as sensitive as pos-
sible to persons who smoked on some days but not every
day. The final categories were <1, 1­<2, 2­<3, 3­<5, and 5
cigarettes per day, on average, during the 5 days preceding
the MEC examination. These cutpoints corresponded to
NHANES III responses of 1­4, 5­9, 10­14, 15­24, and 25
cigarettes smoked during the previous 5 days.
Bivariate tables were used to examine the strength of the
association between each covariate and disagreement of bio-
chemical and self-reported smoking status. We fitted logis-
tic regression models that included all possible combina-
tions of the covariates. Covariates were added and deleted
from the models until we found models that best character-
ized the disagreement patterns and produced stable log odds
ratios. We did not include interactions between covariates in
any of the models, because of small sample sizes. Finally,
self-reported smoking status ascertained during the house-
hold interview was used only as a covariate. It was not used
to calculate misclassification.
RESULTS
Study population
Compared with self-reported smokers, self-reported non-
smokers comprised a higher proportion of persons who were
female, were aged 65 years or older, had 13 or more years of
education, and did not live below the poverty level (table 1).
Agreement analysis
Among self-reported smokers, 92.5 percent were also bio-
chemically classified as smokers (serum cotinine level >15.0

ng/ml) (table 2). Among self-reported nonsmokers, 98.6 per-
cent were also biochemically classified as nonsmokers
(serum cotinine level 15.0 ng/ml). According to self-
reports, the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the previous
5 days was 30.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval:
28.6, 31.8), and according to serum cotinine concentrations,
it was 29.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval: 27.4,
30.6).
Statistics and modeling
When we assessed agreements and discrepancies between
self-report and biochemical analysis by selected sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of the participants, we found an aver-
age discrepancy of 7.5 percent among self-reported smokers
(range: from 0.5 percent for persons who reported smoking
an average of five or more cigarettes per day to 71.5 percent
for persons who reported smoking less than one cigarette
per day) (table 3). Of the self-reported smokers with serum
cotinine levels less than or equal to 15.0 ng/ml, 87.5 percent
smoked an average of fewer than five cigarettes per day
(data not shown).
We found an average discrepancy of 1.4 percent among
self-reported nonsmokers (range: from 0.6 percent for
Mexican Americans to 3.1 percent for persons with 0­8
years of education) (table 3). Persons aged 65 years or older,
Blacks, and persons with 0­8 years of education had a dis-
crepancy of 2.0 percent or higher.
In the final model for self-reported smokers, after simul-
taneous adjustment for several selected characteristics, we
found that younger persons were more likely than persons
aged 65 years, and Blacks were less likely than Whites, to
be in discrepancy with results from biochemical assessment
(table 4). The average number of cigarettes smoked per day
in the past 5 days was inversely and highly associated with
the probability of discrepancy. The presence or absence of a
smoking-related disease was not associated with the proba-
bility of discrepancy in this study.
In the final model for self-reported nonsmokers, after
simultaneous adjustment for several selected characteristics,
we found that discrepancy with the results of biochemical
assessment was more likely among Blacks than among
Whites, less likely among Mexican Americans than among
Whites, less likely among persons with 12 years of educa-
tion than among persons with 0­8 years of education, and
more likely among persons who reported two or more smok-
ers living in the home than among persons who reported no
smokers living in the home (table 5). Persons who were
classified as former smokers or current smokers (according
to the household interview) and who reported not smoking
in the previous 5 days (during the MEC visit) were more
likely to be in discrepancy than those who were classified as
never smokers.
DISCUSSION
The results of our study indicate that self-report smoking
and biochemical measurement of serum cotinine concentra-
tion give approximately the same overall estimates of smok-
ing prevalence. Most validity studies regarding smoking
have concentrated on deception among self- reported non-
smokers (i.e., cessation studies), but we found a higher over-
all discrepancy between self-reports and serum cotinine lev-
els among self-reported smokers (7.5 percent) than among
self-reported nonsmokers (1.4 percent).
We can postulate several explanations for the observed
discrepancy between self-reports and the biochemical mea-
sures among self-reported smokers. First, because the half-
life of cotinine in the blood is 18­20 hours, the serum coti-
nine levels of smokers who do not smoke every day or who
smoke only a few cigarettes per day will be more likely to
drop to 15.0 ng/ml in a shorter period of time than those of
smokers who smoke a greater amount of cigarettes.
Approximately 34.7 percent of smokers who reported smok-
ing an average of fewer than five cigarettes per day in the
previous 5 days had a serum cotinine level less than or equal
to 15.0 ng/ml. About one third of those who smoked fewer
than five cigarettes per day can be considered occasional
smokers (less than one cigarette per day). Occasional smok-
ers, in particular, did not smoke daily; they smoked just a
few cigarettes per day when they did smoke, and the num-
ber of cigarettes they smoked per day probably varied
greatly. It is possible that for occasional smokers, serum
cotinine concentration either never reached levels of >15.0
ng/ml or reached low levels (15.0 ng/ml) by the time the
blood was drawn during the physical examination.
Unfortunately, no data were collected about when the last
cigarette was smoked. Recency of use is now measured in
the NHANES.

Second, persons who reported smoking fewer than five
cigarettes per day may in fact have been nonsmokers who
provided inaccurate information about their smoking status.
However, we observed a pattern at very low levels of ciga-
rette smoking: the lower the number of cigarettes smoked
per day, the greater the likelihood of discrepancy. Thus,
deception seems unlikely.
Third, despite the observations of Pirkle et al. (20), the
selected cotinine cutoff point of >15.0 ng/ml may be too
high to identify all smokers. When we reanalyzed the data
using a cutoff of >10.0 ng/ml for active smokers and 10.0
ng/ml for nonsmokers, the discrepancy for self-reported
smokers dropped from 7.5 percent to 6.3 percent but the
overall results for predictors of discrepancy did not change.
Previous studies that have measured cotinine levels in the
blood have used different cutoff points, usually 10.0­15.0
ng/ml, to detect active smoking (15, 34­38). We did not cal-
culate a receiver operating characteristic curve to choose the
cutoff that maximized sensitivity and specificity, because
the receiver operating characteristic curve may be affected
by inaccurate self-reported smoking information. A receiver
operating characteristic curve is a graph of sensitivity (the
true-positive fraction) against the complement of specificity
(the false-positive fraction) for all possible cutoff points
(39).
Previous studies have found that, in the United States,
Blacks have higher serum cotinine levels than Whites do at
similar levels of smoking (34, 40­44). Thus, self-reported

similar levels of cigarette smoking will be less likely to be
in discrepancy with the selected biochemical cutoff. Among
self-reported smokers, our finding of lower discrepancy
among Blacks than among Whites is consistent with these
reports. It is possible that different cutoff points for cotinine
concentration may be needed for Blacks and Whites. This
issue should be studied further; differences in the character-
istics of the cigarettes smoked, smoking topography, or the
pharmacokinetics of nicotine should be considered (43).
Information about differences in serum cotinine concentra-
tions between Whites or Blacks and Mexican Americans is
scarce.
We can also postulate a number of explanations for the
discrepancy between self-reports and the results of bio-
chemical assessment among self-reported nonsmokers.
First, Blacks, as compared with Whites, may be highly
exposed to environmental tobacco smoke or may differ in
terms of nicotine pharmacokinetics. These two possibilities
would help to explain why Blacks who reported themselves
to be nonsmokers were more likely to have a cotinine level
greater than 15.0 ng/ml. Indeed, several studies have found
differences in serum cotinine concentrations between Black
and White nonsmokers (20, 42, 45­48). In these studies,
Blacks had higher cotinine levels than did Whites, even after
environmental tobacco smoke exposure and other factors
were taken into account. Because racial differences in nico-
tine pharmacokinetics (44) and genetic polymorphisms
involved (49) exist, different cutoff points are probably

needed for each racial group. Second, among all self-reported
nonsmokers who lived with two or more smokers who
smoked inside the home, the high concentration of serum
cotinine may have been the result of high exposure to envi-
ronmental tobacco smoke. Third, among respondents who
reported being current smokers (during the household inter-
view) but reported not smoking in the 5 days before their
blood was drawn (in the MEC interview), the presumably
high serum cotinine level (on average, a regular smoker has a
serum cotinine concentration of 250 ng/ml) may have not
dropped to 15.0 ng/ml by the time of the MEC interview.
Fourth, respondents may have provided accurate information
in the household interview but not in the MEC interview.
Fifth, perhaps most of the persons who reported not smoking
in the previous 5 days and had serum cotinine levels greater
than 15.0 ng/ml provided inaccurate information about their
smoking status. Eighty-three percent of self-reported non-
smokers who were determined by the biochemical measure to
be smokers had a serum cotinine level greater than or equal to
25.0 ng/ml (the median cotinine level for non-tobacco users
in NHANES III was <2.0 ng/ml (20)), and 38 percent had a
serum cotinine level greater than or equal to 100.0 ng/ml (data
not shown). A value greater than 100.0 ng/ml is inconsistent
with either high exposure to environmental tobacco smoke or
occasional smoking. Sensitivity to the social stigma associ-
ated with smoking has been cited as one reason why people
might underreport their smoking status (48).
Overall, in this study there were higher levels of discrep-
ancy among self-reported smokers than among self-reported
nonsmokers. Smoking patterns, including the extent of nico-
tine dosing, may be the main explanation for the 7.5 percent
discrepancy among self-reported smokers, and social stigma
may be the main explanation for the 1.4 percent discrepancy
among self-reported nonsmokers. The private setting used to
collect information on smoking status in NHANES III may
have contributed to the low levels of discrepancy observed
among self-reported nonsmokers.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide quan-
tification of the discrepancy between self-reported smoking
information and data from a biochemical measure for the
US population aged 17 years or older. Although biochemi-
cal assessment is generally believed to be more reliable than
self-reports in assessing smoking status, its validity at very
low levels of cigarette smoking may be questioned.
Specifically, the validity of serum cotinine concentration as
an objective measure for detecting true smokers should be
carefully considered when trying to assess smoking status
among groups with a substantial proportion of persons who
smoke fewer than five cigarettes per day (i.e., Mexican
Americans). In general, however, self-reports appear to be a
very good indicator of actual smoking status.
