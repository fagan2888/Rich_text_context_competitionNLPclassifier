Introduction
Cervical cancer, a highly preventable form of cancer, is
mostly common among women in sub-SaharanAfrica (Louie
et al., 2009). In fact, the age-standardized incidence rate of
cervical cancer in sub-Saharan Africa is one of the highest in
the world, and it is estimated at 31 per 100,000 women com-
pared with 12.1 in Northern Africa and 11.6 in Europe
(Ferlay, Bray, Pisani, & Parkin, 2004). Although both cervi-
cal cancer incidence and mortality rates have seen significant
decline in the developed world where 63% of women are
screened, this is not the case in developing countries.
Gakidou, Nordhagen, and Obermeyer (2008) reported that
only around 19% of women in developing countries had a
pap smear in the 3 years prior to the survey. Knowledge of
cervical cancer risk factors and particularly knowledge of its
strong relationship to human papillomavirus (HPV), inde-
pendent of other factors (Bosch, Lorincz, Munoz, Meijer, &
Shah, 2002), have helped to combat this cancer in developed
countries through massive cervical cancer screening pro-
grams. This study examined knowledge of cervical cancer
risk factors among educated women in Lomé, Togo. The fol-
lowing questions guided this research: (a) What do educated
Togolese women know about cervical cancer? (b) How accu-
rate is their knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors? and
(c) What are the factors that correlate with accurate knowl-
edge of cervical cancer risk factors? Although cervical can-
cer screening is the best preventive method for cancer
reduction, in an environment such as Togo, where health care
is a significant challenge for the average citizen and screen-
ing programs are nonexistent, we believe that knowledge of
cervical cancer risk factors will be necessary and beneficial
for women who may ultimately choose to change their risk
behaviors to minimize the odds of cervical cancer.
There are several risk factors for cervical cancer. Cervical
cancer is commonly linked to sexual behaviors and risk fac-
tors, such as unprotected sex, having multiple sexual part-
ners, and having a partner who has/had multiple sexual
partners (Bosch et al., 2002; Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis,
STD, and TB Prevention, Division of STD Prevention, 2013;
Cooper et al., 2007). Having an immunosuppression is
another risk factor. Multiparity has been found to be another

Knowledge of Cervical Cancer Risk
Factors Among Educated Women
in Lomé, Togo: Half-Truths and
Misconceptions
Ami R. Moore1 and Nichola Driver1
Abstract
Cervical cancer, a highly preventable form of cancer, is mostly common among women in sub-Saharan Africa. This study
assessed what Togolese educated women know about cervical cancer and the accuracy of their knowledge. It also examined
the factors that correlate with accurate knowledge among the women. This study, like its previous ones, pointed out the lack
of accurate knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors among educated women in Togo. However, unlike the earlier studies,
it showed the beliefs and thoughts of educated women with regard to cervical cancer knowledge and explained some of the
inaccuracies of the beliefs. It also showed the necessity of educating Togolese women, even the educated ones, about cervical
cancer and its risk factors as these women hold inaccurate knowledge about the disease. Ideally, screening for cervical cancer
is the primary means to control it. However, in an environment where screening is not readily available and accessible,
knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors may aid women to change behaviors that put them at risk. Although health officials
may have their own priorities, it is very important to know that cervical cancer is a public health issue, which could be curbed.

risk factor (Hildesheim et al., 2001). Research has also
shown that diet has an impact on the development of cervical
cancer (Shannon et al., 2002). Poverty is another risk factor
because women of lower socio-economic status have higher
rates of incidence of cervical cancer (American Cancer
Society, 2013a; Teitelman, Stringer, Averbuch, & Witkoski,
2009) and mortality from the disease (Eggleston et al., 2006;
Singh, Miller, Hankey, & Edwards, 2004). Also, use of an
intrauterine device (IUD) might act as a protective co-factor
against the development of the disease (Castellsagué et al.,
2011). Although cervical cancer itself is not hereditary, stud-
ies have reported that genetics may offer some insights into
why some cases of HPV develop into cancer, while others do
not (Franco, Schlecht, & Saslow, 2003; Guzman et al., 2008).
Also linked to cervical cancer is exposure to diethylstilbes-
trol (DES), a hormone prescribed to pregnant women
between 1940 and 1971 to prevent pregnancy complications
(Herbst, Ulfelder, & Poskanzer, 1999; Rubin, 2007).
Smoking is another risk factor (Brinton et al., 1986; Hall,
Weinman, & Marteau, 2004; Kjellberg et al., 2000). Early
age at first sex and early age at first pregnancy have also
been found to increase risk of cervical cancer (Louie, de
Sanjose, & Mayaud, 2009). Similarly, although some
researchers have suggested a causal relationship between
long-term use of oral contraceptives and cervical cancer
(Smith et al., 2003), there has been some controversy over
these findings (Miller, Blumenthal, & Blanchard, 2004).
However, all of these factors are recognized by the American
Cancer Society (2013).
In the United States, recent studies have mainly examined
women's awareness of cervical cancer with regard to HPV
virus and Pap smear testing. They reported low rates of
knowledge of HPV causing cervical cancer and cervical can-
cer risk factors (Baer, Allen, & Braun, 2000; Denny-Smith,
Bairan, & Page, 2006; Lambert, 2001; Mays et al., 2000;
Tiro, Meissner, Kobrin, & Chollette, 2007).Also, studies that
specifically examined knowledge of cervical cancer risk fac-
tors from around the world have shown low levels of knowl-
edge in general. In Turkey, for example, Yanikkerem, Goker,
Piro, Dikayak, and Koyuncu (2013) found that women had
generally moderate knowledge that sexual behavior is related
to risk of developing cervical cancer. In Ethiopia, Getahun,
Mazengia, Abuhay, and Birhanu (2013) found that more that
78% of the 633 women they studied had heard of cervical
cancer, yet only around 30% could name a risk factor for the
disease. In a recent study in Nigeria, around 40% of study
participants (n = 360) were aware of cervical cancer, and
around 30% knew that it was preventable. However, only
0.6% had ever been screened (Eze, Umeora, Obuna,
Egwuatu, & Ejikeme, 2012). In South Africa, Wellensiek,
Moodley, Moodley, and Nkwanyana (2002) also reported
that socio-demographic factors played a role in knowledge of
risk factors. Participants from lower socio-economic back-
grounds were less likely to be aware of cervical cancer
screening.
Setting
Togo is a small Western African country with an estimated
population of 6.5 million in 2011. More than 60% of the
Togolese population was living in poverty in 2006
(International Monetary Fund [IMF], 2008). Literacy rate
for Togolese aged 15 and above was 57% in 2009 (The
World Bank Group, 2013). Formal education in Togo has a
pyramid shape whereby the number of pupils decreases as
the level of education increases. In addition, there are great
disparities between the number of females and males who
attend school, and the differences become even more sig-
nificant as one goes up the educational attainment ladder.
For instance, in 2011, the female/male ratio was 63% for
students in Grades 7 to 10, but decreased to 40% for stu-
dents in Grades 11 to 13 (Education Policy and Data Center,
2012). Even a fewer number of women enroll and obtain a
higher education.
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among
Togolese women. It was estimated that every year around
433 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 265 die
from it (World Health Organization [WHO]/Institut Català
d'Oncologia [ICO], HPV Information Center, 2014).
However, note that women who do not seek modern medical
care may not be included in these numbers. In addition, a
study on the general knowledge of cancer risk factors among
Togolese reported low knowledge (Moore, 2013). In such an
environment, we thought that targeting women with a higher
level of education (university level of education) is war-
ranted as these women represent a special group of people
and also education tends to significantly correlate with accu-
rate knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors (Getahun et
al., 2013; Wellensiek et al., 2002).
Health care in Togo, just like in most developing coun-
tries, is a substantial task given limited available resources.
Although some improvements have been made in the past
few decades, mortality is still high in general, and women's
health is still problematic (WHO, 2011). Affordability of
health care services is another challenge. In fact, about 35%
of Togolese have problems paying for medical prescriptions
above US$10 (XOF5,000; African Economic Outlook,
2014). Although urban dwellers may have a better access to
health care services relative to rural residents, childhood
malnutrition, maternal health, and women's health are some
urgent areas of health that need improvement in Togo regard-
less of setting (The World Bank Group, 2014).
Method
Data Collection and Procedure
A cross-sectional survey of 97 educated women was con-
ducted in Lomé, Togo, from October to December, 2012.
The study protocol was approved by the University of North
Texas Institutional Review Board. The questionnaire was
originally in English and translated into French, the official
Moore and Driver 3
language of Togo. The first author, with the help of a trained
Togolese woman who had experience in data collection
methods, collected the data. We recruited women who were
university students or have graduated from university. The
survey took on average 25 min. Participants were paid an
equivalent of US$4 (CFA2,000).
Participants were asked to freely list the risk factors for
cervical cancer that they knew and explain the reasons why
they thought those factors were risk factors. Then, they were
presented a list of established risk factors for cervical cancer
(American Cancer Society, 2013) and were asked whether or
not these factors were risk factors. Questions about estab-
lished risk factors for cervical cancer included the following
11 factors: (a) HPV, (b) use of oral contraceptive, (c) multi-
parity, (d) age, (e) sexually transmitted infections (STIs), (f)
smoking, (g) multiple sexual partners, (h) early sexual initia-
tion, (i) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), (j) use of oral
contraceptives, and (k) cancer history in family. The women
had three options to choose from: "yes," "no," or "don't
know." These were later regrouped in two categories: "Yes"
= accurate knowledge and "Don't know" and "No" = inac-
curate knowledge. In addition, they were asked whether they
knew about Pap smear test and had ever had the test. Also,
they were asked whether they would like to be tested if Pap
smear test was readily available and accessible in Togo.
Data Analysis
We first presented all the risk factors that participants listed
in a frequency distribution table (Table 2). Second, we then
translated verbatim participants' explanations of why they
thought their listed factors were risk factors. Third, the expla-
nations were then analyzed and grouped according to each
risk factor. We also created a frequency distribution of par-
ticipants' knowledge of each of the established risk factors
(Table 3). Fourth, we created a variable (knowledge scores)
that captured participants' knowledge of the established risk
factors as done by Ralston et al. (2003). Each knowledge
score is the number of risk factors a participant correctly
identified ranging from 0 (none correctly identified) to 11
(all correctly identified). A multiple linear regression analy-
sis was conducted in which knowledge of cervical cancer
risk factors was assessed controlling for participants' demo-
graphic, sexual history, and Pap smear knowledge variables.
The results are found in Table 4.
Results
Sample
The women who participated in this study were all residents
of Lomé, the capital city of Togo. Table 1 reports the descrip-
tive statistics for the sample of 97 educated women who par-
ticipated in this study. The majority of the women were in
college and university in Lomé at the time of the study. The
mean age was about 28 years (27.85) with a range of 18 to 58
years. They had 15.40 mean years of education. They were
mostly unmarried (80%). They reported a mean number of
about 2 (1.98) lifetime sexual partners with a range of 1 to 6
partners. Although 17% of the women had exchanged sex for
valuable resources, 18% had ever had a sexually transmitted
infection. Also, 74% of the women reported having had sex
within the past 6 months of the study. Only 30% of the sam-
ple knew about Pap smear testing, but even fewer women
had ever had the test (8%). They all agreed that they would
volunteer for a Pap smear test to make sure they did not have
cervical cancer if the test was readily available and
affordable.
Knowledge of Cervical Cancer Risk Factors
Study participants listed what they thought were cervical
cancer risk factors. Lack of personal hygiene (including poor
sanitation, poor sexual hygiene, and washing with dirty
water), botched induced abortions, and STIs were the top

three factors that were listed, closely followed by vaginal
infections and use of contraceptives especially IUD (Table
2). However, as shown in Table 2, the established risk factors
such as having multiple sexual partners and early sexual ini-
tiation were less listed. Some of the least listed risk factors
include not having children, tumor in the breast, and mastur-
bation. Ironically, HPV, the primary risk factor for cervical
cancer, was not mentioned by any of the participants. This, in
fact, shows the inaccuracy of the knowledge that our partici-
pants had regarding cervical cancer risk factors.
Participants' Explanations of Listed Risk Factors
Poor personal hygiene.When asked to explain why they
thought the listed factors were risk factors, participants gave
a variety of explanations. For instance, most of the women
who thought poor personal hygiene was a risk factor for cer-
vical cancer expressed their views as shown in the following
comments. A 37-year old married woman who was a jour-
nalist explained, "When personal hygiene is not practiced,
especially around the genital area, microbes can enter the
vagina and later cause cancer of the cervix."
Another respondent who was 49 years old, had 16 years
of education, and was teaching at a high school simply
explained,
A woman that lacks corporal hygiene and personal cleanliness
of her clothing facilitate viruses to enter into her organism. The
organism becomes weak and sick because cleanliness gives
health and vigor to the body. And if a woman does not take care
of herself (body), things become complicated and may lead to
cervical cancer.

For these women, microbes and viruses cause cervical
cancer, and hence, one must practice proper hygiene to avoid
this cancer. Although it is true that cervical cancer is caused
by a certain kind of virus (HPV), practicing proper hygiene
does not shelter one from getting HPV if the risk factors such
as having unprotected sex, having multiple sexual partners,
and having a partner who had/has multiple sexual partners
are present in one's life. This is important information that
our study participants need to understand.
Induced abortions.Some of the women who mentioned
induced abortions as a risk factor related it to infections. A
26-year-old single woman with 15 years of education stated,
"Induced abortion create a disturbance for the uterus. And
when abortions are botched, they cause huge infections that
lead to cervical cancer." A college student with 15 years of
education also explained why she thought induced abortions
are a risk factor for cervical cancer as follows: "The cervix
can be infected during induced abortions. The infections
have to be well treated otherwise they later become the germs
for cervical cancer."
The comments above show another aspect of misconcep-
tion that participants had about cervical cancer risk factors.
No study has linked induced abortions to cervical cancer.
Sexually transmitted infections.
In addition, participants
reported that STIs were risk factors because when these
infections are not properly treated, they become cancerous. A
24-year-old college student who had 15 years of education
simply explained, "Improperly treated STIs become compli-
cated and grave, and it degenerates in the worst case scenario
into cancer of the cervix." Another woman with 18 years of
education also reported, "STIs are always dangerous for the
female genital, and without the proper treatment can lead to
fatal cervical cancer."
Overall, participants had erroneous information about
cervical cancer risk factors and hence their explanations
were inaccurate. There were a lot of misconceptions and
half-truths. Although some were able to identify STIs as risk
factors, they mostly did not understand that HPV was the
virus that causes cervical cancer. Also, as shown in Table 2,
believing that a lack of personal hygiene is a risk factor might
give these women a false sense of protection as some might
adamantly practice personal cleanliness and then believed
that they were not at risk of getting cervical cancer. Also,
those who never had an induced abortion might falsely think
they were sheltered from getting cervical cancer. In addition,
contrary to some scientific studies, which reported that use
of IUD may act as a protective factor against cervical cancer,
some of the participants thought the use of IUD is a risk fac-
tor instead, as shown in the following comments. Safia, a
25-year-old college student with 15 years of education
explained her belief, "When IUDs are not properly main-
tained, they accumulate microbes in the vagina and become
source of cancer." Carina, another college student, with 16
years of education also simply stated, "having IUD in a
woman for months or a year can be a source of infection that
may lead to cervical cancer."
Identification of Established Risk Factors
Participants were given a list of the established risk factors
and were asked whether or not these factors were risk fac-
tors. There is also a variation in the proportions of partici-
pants who correctly identified an established cervical cancer
risk factor (Table 3). Only 4 of the 11 established risk factors
were accurately identified by most of the participants: STIs,
multiple sexual partners, HIV/AIDS, and multiparity.
However, although almost 91% of the women correctly iden-
tified STIs as a risk factor, only about 20% thought HPV was
a risk factor and was the least identified factor. Again, this
shows that the educated women who we studied were poorly
knowledgeable about HPV being the primary cause of cervi-
cal cancer. Having multiple sexual partners was the second
highest identified risk factor (87.6%), followed by HIV/
AIDS (67%).
Multiple Linear Regression Results
Next, before reporting the results of the multiple linear
regression analysis of accurate knowledge of cervical cancer
risk factors, we presented some statistics on the knowledge
score. The knowledge score had a mean of 5.6 with a stan-
dard deviation of 2.25 and a minimum of 1 and a maximum
of 10. This means that although some participants were only
able to correctly identify 1 risk factor, others were able to
correctly identify 10 risk factors out of the 11 established
factors that were presented. The multiple regression analysis
showed that only two variables significantly affect knowl-
edge of cancer risk factors among the educated women: age
and years of education (Table 4). In fact, 1 year of education
increased the knowledge score by 0.694 whereas an addi-
tional year in age increased a woman's knowledge of cervi-
cal cancer risk factors by only 0.081. None of the other
factors significantly correlate with accurate knowledge of
cervical cancer risk factors among study participants. In fact,
these results confirm the qualitative data presented earlier.
Discussion
This study attempts to assess what Togolese educated women
know about cervical cancer and the accuracy of their knowl-
edge. It also examines the factors that correlate with accurate
knowledge among the women. Cervical cancer is the second
most frequent cancer among women in Togo. It has a very
high mortality rate as an estimated 417 of the 595 women
with cervical cancer die every year (WHO/ICO, HPV
Information Center, 2014). Also, oncology services are not
only cost prohibitive in Togo but also not supported by the
health care infrastructure that was present at the time of the
6 SAGE Open
survey. Hence, Togolese who can afford cancer treatment
usually go to the neighboring country of Ghana because
Togo does not have cancer treatment facilities (International
Atomic Energy Agency, 2008). Although early detection
makes a significant difference in cervical cancer as in other
cancers, screening programs are unavailable in Togo. In such
an environment, it is important for Togolese women to have
accurate knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors to adopt
healthy behaviors that will help reduce their risks of acquir-
ing this cancer.
Knowledge of cancer risk factors among the educated
women sampled is low as found in other studies (Getahun et
al., 2013; Yanikkerem et al., 2013). Only about 20% were
able to recognize and identify HPV as a risk factor. Also,
most of the women correctly identified only 4 of the 11
established risk factors that were used for this study.Although
a significant proportion (91%) identified STIs as risk factors,
they were unable to explain how STIs facilitate HPV to
develop into cervical cancer. None of the women listed HPV
when asked to list cervical cancer risk factors.
However, contrary to previous studies, because we asked
the women to explain the reasons for listing each of the fac-
tors that they mentioned, we were able to see a pattern of
certain beliefs among them. First, some of the women
believed that induced abortions are a risk factor, especially if
the abortion is not properly performed. The idea behind this
belief may stem from the fact that induced abortions are not
performed under safe conditions and lead to complications
and even maternal deaths in Africa in general (Guttmacher
Institute, 2012). However, this belief of induced abortion as
a risk factor for cervical cancer is erroneous as no study has
linked cervical cancer to induced abortion. Second, some of
our study participants associated cervical cancer with a lack
of personal hygiene because they thought sanitary practices
preclude one from getting the virus. This belief may have
come from the association of disease to germs, microbes, and
viruses. Although there is an association between diseases
and the different disease causing agents, cervical cancer is
mainly caused by HPV, a sexually transmitted virus. Thus,
this shows substantial level of inaccuracy and misconception
with regard to cervical cancer risk factors, although the
women we studied were quite educated compared with the
general population. In addition, contrary to some scientific
studies (Castellsagué et al., 2011; Wellensiek et al., 2002)
that reported that use of IUD may act as a protective factor
against cervical cancer, some of the participants thought the
use of IUD is a risk factor instead.
To examine factors that correlate with cervical cancer risk
factors, we ran a multiple linear regression model. Results
show that only age and education positively correlate with
accurate knowledge of the risk factors. We were surprised
that knowledge of Pap smear did not significantly correlate
with accurate knowledge as shown in other studies. However,
it could be that some of the women just heard of the Pap
smear test; they did not know what it really does. Also, the
result could be explained by the fact that a very small percent
(8%) had ever done the Pap smear.
There are a few issues that need to be mentioned about the
study. There is a lack of firm evidence of causality as the data
were cross-sectionally collected. Also, findings may not be
generalized to the whole Togolese population because a con-
venience sample was used. Finally, as any self-reported
study, respondents may be biased in their responses because
of social desirability. However, despite these limitations, we
believe our study is important as it explains some of the
beliefs and thoughts of educated Togolese women about cer-
vical cancer risk factors.
This study, unlike the previous ones, went beyond just
ascertaining accurate knowledge of cervical cancer among
educated women. By asking the women to explain why their
listed factors were risk factors, we were able to fully under-
stand misconceptions and half-truths about their knowledge.
Hence, as a first step, education programs about cervical can-
cer risk factors are important to dispel these inaccurate
beliefs.Also, findings of this study may be relevant to women
in other African countries as studies have indicated low level
of knowledge in several countries such as Ethiopia (Getahun
et al., 2013), Nigeria (Umeora et al., 2012), and South Africa
(Wellensiek et al., 2002). In addition, cervical cancer aware-
ness programs and campaigns must be carefully developed
and must not assume accurate knowledge in any specific
subgroup if campaigns and programs are to be effective,
given that educated women in our study had such inaccurate
knowledgeoftheriskfactorsforcervicalcancer.Furthermore,
women with different levels of education should be trained
as opinion leaders who will diffuse the knowledge of cervi-
cal cancer risk factors among their respective population
groups. As mentioned earlier, we understand that screening
is the best approach to preventing cervical cancer; however,
in most of low-income countries, including Togo, cervical
cancer screening is not readily available and accessible to
women, and hence, we believe that knowledge of cervical
cancer risk factors will be beneficial in reducing risk behav-
iors among women.
