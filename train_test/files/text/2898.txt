Abstract
The aim of this paper is to assess how German savings banks adjust capital and risk
under capital regulation. We estimate a modified version of the model developed by
Shrieves and Dahl (1992). This paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First,
we test the capital buffer theory (Marcus 1984, Milne and Whalley 2002). Second, we
use dynamic panel data techniques that explicitly take unobserved heterogeneity into
account. And third, we provide new evidence for non-US banks by using a new dataset
of supervisory data collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank. We find evidence that the
coordination of capital and risk adjustments depends on the amount of capital the bank
holds in excess of the regulatory minimum (the "capital buffer"). Banks with low
capital buffers try to rebuild an appropriate capital buffer by raising capital while
simultaneously lowering risk. In contrast, banks with high capital buffers try to
maintain their capital buffer by increasing risk when capital increases. These findings
support the capital buffer theory.

Non-technical Summary
Economic theory provides contradictory results about banks' reaction to minimum
capital requirements. The empirical literature has mainly tested the moral hazard theory,
building on a model developed by Shrieves and Dahl (1992). The discussion paper
"Does capital regulation matter for bank behaviour" focuses on an alternative theory,
the capital buffer theory (Marcus 1984, Milne and Whalley 2002). The capital buffer is
the excess capital a bank holds above the minimum capital requirement. The capital
buffer theory implicates that banks with low capital buffers attempt to rebuild an
appropriate capital buffer and banks with high capital buffers attempt to maintain their
capital buffer. We derive testable hypotheses for the capital buffer theory based on the
model of Shrieves and Dahl and provide empirical evidence for German savings banks
and cooperative banks.
Our findings support the capital buffer theory. The most important results are:
1. The coordination of capital and risk adjustments depends on the amount of capital the
bank holds in excess of the regulatory minimum (the "capital buffer").
2. Banks with low capital buffers try to rebuild an appropriate capital buffer by raising
capital while simultaneously lowering risk.
3. Banks with high capital buffers try to maintain their capital buffer by increasing risk
when capital increases.
4. We find mixed (no) evidence that banks with low capital buffers adjust capital (risk)
faster than banks with high capital buffers.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Die Auswirkungen regulatorischer Kapitalanforderungen auf das Verhalten von Banken
sind von theoretischer Seite unklar. Üblicherweise beschränkt sich die empirische
Literatur zu diesem Thema auf die Untersuchung der Moral-Hazard-Theorie und
benutzt dazu das Modell von Shrieves und Dahl (1992). Das Diskussionspapier "Does
capital regulation matter for bank behaviour" untersucht einen alternativen
Erklärungsansatz, die Kapitalpuffertheorie (Marcus 1984, Milne and Whalley 2002).
Als Kapitalpuffer bezeichnet man das Überschusskapital, das über der regulatorischen
Mindestanforderung gehalten wird. Die Kapitalpuffertheorie impliziert, dass Banken
mit niedrigem Kapitalpuffer bemüht sind, den Puffer wieder aufzubauen, während
Banken mit hohem Kapitalpuffer versuchen, die Kapitalausstattung konstant zu halten.
Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird, ebenfalls ausgehend vom Modell von Shrieves und Dahl,
ein Test für die Kapitalpuffertheorie vorgeschlagen. Gleichzeitig werden empirische
Ergebnisse für deutsche Sparkassen und Kreditgenossenschaften präsentiert.
Die empirische Studie bestätigt die Kapitalpuffertheorie. Im einzelnen zeigen sich
folgende Ergebnisse:
1. Die Koordination der Kapital- und Risikoanpassungen hängt von der Höhe des
Kapitalpuffers ab.
2. Banken mit geringem Kapitalpuffer versuchen einen angemessenen Kapitalpuffer
aufzubauen, indem sie gleichzeitig ihre Kapitalausstattung verbessern und ihre
Risikopositionen reduzieren.
3. Demgegenüber versuchen Banken mit hohem Kapitalpuffer den Kapitalpuffer zu
halten, indem sie ihre Risikopositionen erhöhen, wenn die Kapitalausstattung steigt.
4. Die These, dass Banken mit niedrigem Kapitalpuffer ihr Kapital (bzw. Risiko)
schneller anpassen als solche mit einem hohen Kapitalpuffer, ist empirisch nicht
bzw. nicht eindeutig zu belegen.

Does capital regulation matter for bank behaviour? Evidence
for German savings banks



1 Introduction
Since the process of deregulation in the 1970s, the supervision of banks has mainly
relied on minimum capital requirements. This prominent role of minimum capital
requirements is particularly reflected in the Basel Capital Accord and the current
process of its revision (Basel II). However, the importance attached to capital
requirements in the supervision of banks raises several questions: How do banks react to
capital requirements? Do they increase capital when they approach the regulatory
minimum? Do they also adjust risk and how are these adjustments interrelated? And
finally, do minimum capital requirements also have an effect on well-capitalized banks?
An increasing branch of the theoretical literature has tried to assess the effects of
minimum capital requirements on capital and banks' risk. This literature argues mainly
within option pricing models or portfolio models and that capital regulation is motivated
mostly by the assumption that banks commit moral hazard. Information asymmetries
and deposit insurance shield banks from the disciplining control of depositors. Merton
(1977) shows within an option pricing model that banks with limited liability can thus
increase shareholder value by decreasing capital and increasing risk. The increasing
default probability is at the expense of the deposit insurance. Furlong and Keeley (1989)
show that ­ by exposing the bank's own funds to potential risks ­ flat capital
requirements can reduce, but do not eliminate the moral hazard incentives. This is
mainly because the amount of capital the bank has to set aside against credit risk does
not depend on the bank's asset quality. Sharpe (1978) shows that risk-based capital

2
requirements can completely eliminate moral hazard. Hence risk-based capital
requirements eventually lower the probability of default, thereby lowering the expected
deposit insurance liability.
Other authors show within portfolio models that flat capital requirements may even
increase risk-taking incentives instead of lowering them. Koehn and Santomero (1980)
argue that the forced increase in expensive capital financing reduces a bank's expected
return. The bank, in turn, tries to increase its profitability by investing in riskier assets.
In some cases, the default probability may even increase. Kim and Santomero (1988)
and Rochet (1992) point out that risk-based capital requirements can eliminate risk-
taking incentives if risk weights are correctly chosen.
The traditional moral hazard literature reviewed above abstracts from rigidities and
adjustment costs. Accordingly, in those models, banks never hold capital in excess of
the regulatory minimum. In practice, however, banks may not be able to instantaneously
adjust capital or risk due to adjustment costs or illiquid markets. Furthermore, under
asymmetric information, raising equity capital could be interpreted as a negative signal
with regard to the bank's value (Myers and Majluf 1984), rendering banks unable or
reluctant to react to negative capital shocks instantaneously. However, a breach of the
regulation triggers costly supervisory actions, possibly even leading to the bank's
closure. Hence banks have an incentive to hold more capital than required (a "capital
buffer") as an insurance against a violation of the regulatory minimum capital
requirement. This incentive increases with the probability of breaching the regulatory
minimum and, hence, with the volatility of the capital ratio. However, raising capital is
relatively costly compared to raising insured deposits. This trade-off determines the
optimum capital buffer (Marcus 1984, Milne and Whalley 2002).
The moral hazard theory and the capital buffer theory have different implications for
how banks adjust capital and risk in the light of minimum capital requirements. The
moral hazard theory predicts that when capital requirements force banks to increase
capital, they will react by also increasing risk. By contrast, the capital buffer theory
predicts that the behaviour of banks depends on the size of their capital buffer: banks
3
with high capital buffers will aim at maintaining their capital buffers while banks with
low capital buffers will aim at rebuilding an appropriate capital buffer. Hence for banks
with high capital buffers, capital and risk adjustments will be positively related while,
for banks with low capital buffer, capital and risk adjustments will be negatively related.
An increasing number of empirical papers (Shrieves and Dahl 1992; Jacques and
Nigro 1997; Aggarwal and Jacques 2001; Rime 2001) has tried to test the moral hazard
theory. Most papers find a positive relationship between capital and risk adjustments,
indicating that banks that have built up capital have, at the same time, also increased
risk. This finding has been interpreted as supporting the moral hazard theory.
We contribute to the literature in three important ways. First, to the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to empirically test the capital buffer theory. To do so, we
allow the relationship between capital and risk adjustments to depend on the size of the
capital buffer. Second, in contrast to much of the literature, we do not pool the data, but
use dynamic panel data techniques in order to account explicitly for bank-specific
effects. And third, we use a new supervisory dataset collected by the Deutsche
Bundesbank. While most of the existing literature studies US banks, we study German
banks, thereby providing further evidence on non-US banks.
Our paper is organised as follows. Section 1 specifies the empirical model and the
hypotheses to be tested. Section 2 and 3 describe the data and the statistical
methodology. Section 4 shows the regression results. Section 5 concludes.

2 The empirical model
2.1 A simultaneous equations model with partial adjustment
The capital buffer and the moral hazard theory discussed above presume that banks
simultaneously determine capital and risk. Empirical tests of the relationship between
capital and risk must recognise this simultaneity. Hence we use a simultaneous
equations model which builds on earlier work by Shrieves and Dahl (1992). The two
equations of the model explain adjustments in capital and risk respectively.1 As the
observed adjustments are the result not only of the discretionary behaviour of banks but
also of exogenous shocks, adjustments are modelled as the sum of a discretionary
component and an exogenous random shock:2

are the exogenous random
shocks in capital and risk levels, respectively, for bank j in period t.
____________________
1 Most empirical models do not try to explain the absolute levels of capital and risk. Instead, they
explain adjustments in capital and risk. The first reason for this is the fact that a theory of the
optimal capital structure for banks does not exist. The theories referred to above, rather, have
implications for how individual banks adjust capital in reaction to adjustment in risk (and vice
versa). To understand the second reason for this specification, let us assume a mean-variance
framework such as in Kim and Santomero (1988). Banks with relatively low risk aversion will then
choose relatively high leverage and relatively high asset risk. We would, thus, expect to observe a
negative cross-sectional correlation between the level of asset risk and capital ratios due to cross-
sectional variation in risk preferences.
2 With respect to capital, exogenous shocks can be the result of unanticipated changes in earnings.
With respect to risk, exogenous shocks are mainly the result of unanticipated economic
developments, such as a changing asset or loan quality or a changing value of the loan collateral
(Hart and Jaffee 1974 and Marcus 1983).
5
The buffer theory additionally assumes that banks face rigidities and adjustment
costs that may prevent them from making instantaneous discretionary adjustments.
Hence we model the discretionary part of observed adjustments in capital and risk in a
partial adjustment framework. This framework assumes that banks aim at establishing
optimal capital and risk levels, the "target levels". Since exogenous shocks drive actual
levels away from target levels, banks will then adjust capital and risk to meet the target.
However, full adjustment may be too costly and/or infeasible. Hence banks adjust levels
only partially towards the target levels. The partial adjustment framework assumes that
the adjustment is proportional to the difference between optimal and actual levels:

the previous period.
Substituting Eqs. (3) and (4) into Eqs. (1) and (2), the observed adjustments in
capital and risk can be written as

Hence the observed adjustments in capital and risk in period t are a function of the
target levels and the lagged levels of capital and risk respectively as well as exogenous
shocks.
1.2 Definitions of capital and risk
We define capital (CAP) as the ratio of total capital to total assets (TCTA). Total capital
consists of all liable capital components permitted under the German Banking Act and
6
is comparable to the definition used in the Basel Capital Accord.3 The definition of risk
is more problematic. More advanced measures, such as value at risk, are not available.
The same holds for the volatility of the market price of a bank's assets. Instead, we
define risk (RISK) as the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets (RWATA). The
rationale for this definition is that the allocation of bank assets among risk categories is
the major determinant of a bank's risk.4
Another reason why we use TCTA and RWATA as definitions of capital and risk,
respectively is the following. The Basel I minimum capital requirement is defined as the
ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets. In order to comply with the 8%
regulatory minimum, banks can adjust the numerator and/or the denominator of the
Basel capital ratio. In the definitions chosen in this paper, dCAP reflects adjustments in
the numerator (capital) while dRISK reflects adjustments in the denominator (risk-
weighted assets). Hence dCAP and dRISK can be interpreted as the two variables banks
have at their discretion to manage their Basel capital ratio. This interpretation is
logically independent of whether or not RISK is a correct measure of risk. The
interpretation as a measure of risk is correct only if the risk weights correctly reflect the
economic risk of the assets. However, empirical evidence shows that the Basel I risk
weights and the economic risk of an asset are only weakly correlated (Avery and Berger
1991). However, regardless of whatever additional risk measures they use in their daily
business, all banks still have to obey regulatory rules. In this sense, they will have to
manage their "regulatory" risk. Despite the shortcomings of RWATA as a measure of
risk and in line with the literature, we interpret RISK as a measure of risk in the
remainder of the paper. However, readers with doubts might want to replace "risk" by
"risk-weighted assets" in the following.
____________________
3 Total capital is defined as core capital plus additional capital minus corrective items specified by the
Banking Act.
4 Support for this measure can be found in Chessen (1987) and Keeton (1989). Shrieves and Dahl
(1992) point out that, apart from allocation, a bank's portfolio risk is also determined by the quality
of loans. In contrast, Jacques and Nigro (1997) argue that the RWATA captures the allocation as
well as the quality aspect of portfolio risk, whereas Avery and Berger (1991) and Berger (1995)
argue that this ratio is positively correlated with risk.
7
1.3 Variables affecting the target levels of capital and risk
The partial adjustment model presented in Eqs. (5) and (6) above suggests that banks
aim at establishing their target capital and risk levels. These target levels are not readily
observable. They depend on other variables specific to the individual bank. In the
following, these explanatory variables and their expected impact on the observed
adjustments in capital and risk are presented.
Size may have an effect on a bank's target capital level as the size of a bank is an
indicator of the bank's access to capital. German law prohibits savings banks from
raising Tier 1 capital via equity markets. Hence savings banks depend on retained
earnings and capital injections by their public owners. However, big savings banks use
subordinated debt issues to raise Tier 2 capital.5 Thus, larger savings banks are more
flexible in raising capital, which renders their target capital level smaller than the target
capital levels of smaller banks. Besides, size may also have an effect on a bank's target
risk level as the size of a bank affects its investment opportunities and diversification
possibilities. The sign of this effect is, however, undetermined (Acharya et al 2002).
Hence we include the natural log of total assets (SIZE) in the capital and risk equations
to capture size effects.
Savings banks have to rely mainly on retained earnings to increase capital. Hence
we include the bank's return on assets (ROA) in the capital equation as a measure of
profits with an expected positive sign.
Current loan losses affect the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets as they
reduce the nominal amount of risk-weighted assets. Building on Rime (2001), we
approximate these losses (LLOSS) with the ratio of new net provisions to total assets
and include LLOSS in the risk equation with an expected negative sign.
____________________
5 Of the 50 banks with the highest number of subordinated debt issues in Basel Committee member
states 15 are German savings banks: 7 central giro institutions and 8 local savings banks (Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision 2003).
8
Besides, we use two control variables which may also affect target capital and risk
levels. First, the savings banking sector has seen a merger wave in the last years. When
a savings bank faces financial troubles, it is merged with a healthy bank in the
neighbourhood. We therefore expect to observe a decrease in capital and an increase in
risk for the take-over bank in the year of the merger. In order to capture these effects,
we include a merger dummy variable (MERGER) in the regression equations, which is
unity in the year a savings bank takes over another bank and zero otherwise. Second, as
savings banks are the main lenders to local firms, we expect local firm insolvencies to
have a negative impact on capital and a positive impact on risk. Hence we approximate
these local insolvencies (INSOLV) with the ratio of firm insolvencies to the total number
of firms in the German state where the savings bank is located. Finally, we also include
year dummy variables, which capture further year-specific macroeconomic effects.
Last but not least, we have to find a criterion to distinguish between banks with high
capital buffers and banks with low capital buffers. The criterion used by the majority of
the literature builds on the capital buffer measured as the absolute difference between
the actual Basel capital ratio and the 8% regulatory minimum capital requirement (the
"absolute capital buffer").
In order to test the capital buffer theory, another criterion which is based on the
standardised capital buffer is, however, more appropriate. Let us assume the existence
of two banks, A and B, both having the same absolute capital buffer. Bank A's capital
buffer is less volatile than Bank B's capital buffer. Hence Bank A is better insured
against a possible violation of the regulatory minimum in spite of both banks holding
the same absolute capital buffer. To capture this effect, we divide the absolute capital
buffer by the bank-specific standard deviation of the absolute capital buffer (the
"standardised capital buffer"). Based on this criterion, we define a regulatory dummy
(REG), which is unity if a bank has a standardised capital buffer equal to or less than a
certain cut-off value and zero otherwise. As cut-off values, we use both the 25
percentile and the median standardised capital buffer. The Sargan (1958) test of
overidentifying restrictions indicates, however, that our regressions based on the median
capital buffer are not valid. Hence we use the 25% centile in the following. For our
9
sample, this threshold is at 1.6887 standard deviations of the capital buffer above the
8% regulatory minimum.
We test three different effects of the size of the capital buffer on capital and risk
adjustments. First, banks with low capital buffers may differ in the magnitude of their
capital and risk adjustments from banks with high capital buffers. Hence we include
REG in the capital and risk equation. Second, we expect that, according to the capital
buffer theory, adjustments in capital and risk are positively related for banks with high
capital buffers while they are negatively related for banks with low capital buffers. In
order to allow for the different relationships between capital and risk, we include dRISK
and REG*dRISK (dCAP and REG*dCAP) in the capital (risk) equation. And third, we
test whether banks with low capital buffers adjust capital and risk faster than banks with
high capital buffers. In order to do so, we include REG*CAPt-1
(REG*RISKt-1
) in
addition to CAPj,t-1
(RISKj,t-1
) in the capital (risk) equation.
1.4 Specification and hypotheses
In order to obtain the standard form of an endogenous lag model that can be estimated
with the software package DPD for Ox (Doornik et al 2002), we add CAPj,t-1
and
RISKj,t-1
to both sides of Eqs. (5) and (6) respectively. With regard to the analysis above,
the empirical model is then specified as follows:

Taking as the null hypotheses that adjustments in capital and risk do not impact on
one another and that the speeds of capital and risk adjustments are equal for banks with
high and low capital buffers respectively, we can state our hypotheses in terms of the
coefficients as follows:
H1a
: 0

 . Adjustments in capital and risk are positively related for
banks with high capital buffers as banks with high capital buffers try to maintain their
capital buffers. For this hypothesis to hold, it is sufficient that one of the two
coefficients is significant.

3 Data description
The German banking system is highly fragmented and heterogenous. Hence coefficients
may not be stable across the different banking groups. To avoid this problem, we try to
create a homogenous sample. First, we regard savings banks only. Savings banks are the
largest banking group in Germany, representing 36% (48%) of the balance sheet total of
all banks (universal banks) (according to the Bundesbank's Banking Statistics). Despite
being publicly owned, they aim at maximising profits (Hartmann-Wendels et al 1998).
Hence the theories discussed above can indeed be tested on the basis of savings banks.
Second, we exclude the central giro institutions from the sample as their portfolio is
very different from those of local savings banks.6 Third, we keep only banks in the
sample which remain in existence for at least four years during the observation period.
Fourth, we drop the 15 savings banks with capital ratios below 8% as they are under the
control of supervisors. And fifth, in order to ensure time series homogeneity, we drop
the years 2001 to 2003, which were affected by the burst of the bubble and the ensuing
economic downturn.7 As a result, our sample consists of about 570 local German
savings banks over the 1993 ­ 2000 period, as 1993 was the earliest year for which data
on risk-weighted assets were available for savings banks. The balance sheet data were
obtained from the Deutsche Bundesbank, which collects bank-level data in its
supervisory function. The insolvency data was obtained from the Federal Statistical
Office (Statistisches Bundesamt).
Throughout the observation period, the savings banks under review held an average
capital buffer of 2.57 standard deviations above the 8% regulatory minimum (see
Appendix for some descriptive statistics of the variables).
____________________
6 Private savings banks (so-called free savings banks) are also excluded from the sample as they are
not subject to regional investment restrictions and therefore have more degrees of freedom in
deciding upon their loan portfolio.
7 The Sargan test is very sensitive to coefficients not being stable over time and therefore indicates
valid instruments only when we drop the years 2001 to 2003.

Table 1 gives the correlations for all non-categorical variables, including relevant
first differences and lags. In addition, it gives the correlations for the capital buffer
measured in absolute terms and in standard deviations above the regulatory minimum
(based on the pooled sample). The correlation between levels of CAP and RISK as well
as between first differences of CAP and RISK are positive. This finding stands in
contrast to Shrieves and Dahl (1992), who find a negative correlation between levels
and a positive correlation between first differences. They argue that the negative
correlation between levels is due to cross-sectional variation in risk preferences: Banks
with low risk aversion would choose low capital ratios and high risk, whereas banks
with high risk aversion would choose high capital ratios and low risk. However, in this
paper, savings banks were deliberately chosen as they are assumed to be a rather
homogenous group of banks. Hence the absence of cross-sectional variation in risk
aversion is not surprising.

4 Methodology and regression results
4.1 Methodology
Unlike previous empirical studies (Shrieves and Dahl 1992; Jacques and Nigro 1997;
Aggarwal and Jacques 2001; Rime 2001), we employ dynamic panel data techniques
which control for the bank-specific effects
j
µ and
j
 . The Within estimator is known
to produce biased estimates when the lagged dependent variable appears as a regressor.8
The bias will approach zero as T goes to infinity (Nickell 1981). However, in our case,
T is relatively small compared to N. To avoid the Nickell bias, we use an instrumental
variable approach.
We take the first difference of the model specified in Eq. (7) in order to eliminate the
individual effect
j
µ , and we try to find suitable instruments for 2

Arellano and Bond (1991) suggest a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator
which uses the entire set of lagged values of CAPj
as instruments. However, in models
with endogenous regressors, using too many instruments could result in seriously biased
estimates. Hence we only use a subsample of the whole history of the series as
instruments in the subsequent cross-section.10 Besides, a possible persistence in

9 We use the capital equation as an example in the following. The same considerations in the choice
of instruments hold for the risk equation.

observed capital and risk adjustments may result in the problem of weak instruments
and losses in asymptotic efficiency when using the Arellano and Bond GMM estimator
(Blundell and Bond 1998). Hence we use the system GMM estimator suggested by
Blundell and Bond (1998), which uses lagged differences of CAPj
as instruments for
equations in levels in addition to the Arellano-Bond instruments.11
As, for our sample, the one- and two-step Blundell-Bond system GMM estimators
produce quite similar estimates, we present only the (asymptotically) more efficient
two-step estimates. However, the two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to be
severely downward-biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998). To
compensate, we use the finite-sample correction to the two-step covariance matrix
derived by Windmeijer (2000).
In the case of the risk equation, the Sargan test indicates that we use invalid
instruments. We attribute this to the well-known characteristic of the Sargan test to be
conservative and we still interpret the estimated coefficients with due caution.
4.2 Regression results
The results of estimating the simultaneous system of Eqs. (7) and (8) are presented in
Tables 2 and 3 respectively in addition to the Sargan test and the tests of serial
correlation in the first-differenced residuals. Each table contains the result for three
different specifications, which vary in the way the regulatory variable affects banks'
capital and risk decisions. Specification I allows adjustments in capital and risk to
depend on whether banks have low or high capital buffers (inclusion of REG);
Specification II additionally allows for higher speeds of adjustment in capital and risk
(inclusion of REG and REG*CAPt-1
and REG*RISKt-1
, respectively); and, finally,
____________________
11 In addition, we also use LLOSSj
and lagged levels of RISKj
as instruments for dRISKj,t
-dRISKj,t-1
in
the difference equations and first differences as instruments in the level equations in order to
account for the simultaneity of capital and risk adjustments. In the specifications where we include
REGj
*CAPj,t-1
and REGj
*dRISKj,t
among the regressors, we also use instrumental variables for these
interaction terms.
15
Specification III additionally allows for differences in the coordination of capital and
risk adjustments (inclusion of REG and REG*dRISK and REG*dCAP, respectively).
The results show that, as expected, the return on assets (ROA) has a statistically
highly significant and positive effect on capital. Hence savings banks seem to rely
heavily on retained earnings in order to increase capital. However, loan losses (LLOSS)
show the expected significant and negative effect on risk only in Specification III. Bank
size (SIZE) has a statistically significant and negative effect on risk, but it seems to have
no effect on capital. The negative effect of bank size on risk stands in contrast to most
other papers and means that larger banks have lower target risk levels than smaller
banks.
The results in Tables 2 and 3 provide also some interesting insights into the impact
of capital regulation on the coordination of capital and risk adjustments. The simplest
way to model the regulatory impact is to include a regulatory dummy variable, thereby
allowing banks with low capital buffers to differ in their capital and risk adjustments by
a certain amount from banks with high capital buffers. However, the coefficients of the
regulatory dummy are significant only in Specification I, where they have signs
opposite to what we expected. The results suggest that banks with low capital buffers
increase capital by 0.28 percentage points less and increase risk by 0.65 percentage
points more than banks with high capital buffers. This counterintuitive result may be
due to the fact that, whereas we measure regulatory pressure in Specification I simply
by including a dummy variable, the impact of regulation is actually more complex.
With respect to lagged capital, we estimate and report (1-6
) instead of 6
. Hence
we have to subtract 1 and multiply by -1 in order to obtain the speed of adjustment. The
estimated speeds of capital and risk adjustment are highly significant and, in line with
the literature, are found to be relatively low. The estimated speed of capital (risk)
adjustment lies in the range [0.0761; 0.0922] ([0.0288; 0.0370]), which means that
shocks to capital (risk) are halved within 7 and 9 years (18 and 24 years). The very low
speed of risk adjustment may be due to the illiquid market for asset-backed securities in
Germany, which renders the banks' asset structure rather rigid. In Specifications II to
16
IV, we additionally allow banks with low capital buffers to adjust capital and risk faster
than banks with high capital buffers. With respect to capital, we find that the coefficient
of REG*CAPt-1
has the expected sign, but is significant in Specification II only. Hence
we find mixed evidence that banks with low capital buffers adjust capital faster than
banks with high capital buffers. The finding of a higher capital adjustment is in line
with the literature (Shrieves and Dahl 1992; Ediz et al 1998; Aggarwal and Jacques
2001). With respect to risk, we find that the coefficient of REG*RISKt-1
is not
significant, so banks with low capital buffers do not seem to adjust risk faster than
banks with high capital buffers.
The coefficient estimates of dRISK and REG*dRISK in the capital equation are
statistically insignificant. Only in Specification I is the coefficient of dRISK
significantly negative at the 10% level. The coefficient estimates of dCAP and
REG*dCAP in the risk equation become statistically significant once REG*dCAP is
included in Specification III. For banks with high capital buffers, the coefficient
estimate of dCAP is positive while, for banks with low capital buffers, the coefficient
estimates of dCAP and REG*dCAP add up to a negative number. The results suggest
that banks with low capital buffers decrease risk when they increase capital, thereby
rebuilding their capital buffer. In contrast, banks with high capital buffers increase risk
when capital increases, thereby maintaining their capital buffer. However, banks with
low capital buffers as well as banks with high capital buffers do not adjust capital when
risk changes. This result is confirmed by a Wald test of the joint significance of the
coefficients of dRISK and REG*dRISK.12 This finding indicates that the coordination of
capital and risk adjustments runs only from capital to risk and not vice versa. Although
we did not expect the coordination to be one-way, the findings support our hypotheses
H1a
and H1b
.
We additionally control for take-overs (MERGER) and local firm insolvencies
(INSOLV). Our results suggest that, contrary to our expectations, mergers and local firm
insolvencies do not seem to have any effect on capital and risk adjustments. INSOLV

has the expected significant and negative sign only in the capital equation in
Specification II. Finally, the significance of the year dummy variables indicates the
existence of further macroeconomic shocks which are not captured by local firm
insolvencies.

5 Conclusion
Minimum capital requirements play a prominent role in modern banking regulation. A
growing branch of the banking literature has dealt with the question of how banks
consider capital regulation in their capital and risk decisions. The two major theories in
this field are the moral hazard theory and the capital buffer theory (Marcus 1984, Milne
and Whalley 2002), which have rivalling predictions for the behaviour of banks. The
empirical literature has mainly tested the moral hazard theory. Building on a model
developed by Shrieves and Dahl (1992), we are the first to test hypotheses on the
relationship between capital and risk adjustments derived from the buffer theory. We
further contribute to the literature by using dynamic panel data techniques that explicitly
take unobserved heterogeneity into account. And finally, we provide new evidence for
non-US banks by using a new dataset of supervisory data collected by the Deutsche
Bundesbank.
We find that capital regulation has an impact on capital and risk adjustments in
several interesting respects. In line with the literature, we find that banks adjust capital
faster than risk. Besides, we find mixed (no) evidence that banks with low capital
buffers adjust capital (risk) faster than banks with high capital buffers. With respect to
the coordination of capital and risk, we find evidence that banks with low capital buffers
attempt to rebuild an appropriate capital buffer by decreasing risk when capital
decreases. In contrast, banks with high capital buffers attempt to maintain their capital
buffer by increasing risk when capital increases. However, banks do not adjust capital
when risk changes. In summary, our findings are in line with the hypotheses derived
from the buffer theory.
