Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, substance
abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoac-
tive substances. Psychoactive substance use can lead to
dependence syndrome (World Health Organization (WHO),
2016). Substance abuse in the current study is therefore
concerned with the harmful or hazardous use of psychoac-
tive substance, including alcohol, illegal drugs, and some
prescription drugs (Outlaw et al., 2012) such as benzodiaz-
epines and opioid analgesics.
Substance abuse is often misconceived in research and
practice as an issue affecting only the younger population.
However, substance abuse is not limited to a specific age
group (Koechl et al., 2012).According toAmerican studies,
the number of people aged 50
years and above in need of
substance-related addiction treatment will reach 4.5million
by 2020 (Gage and Melillo, 2011). Nogueira et al. (2013)
posited that the aging of the "baby boomer" cohort, those
born between the years of 1946 and 1964, contributed to
such higher rates of substance abuse than earlier cohorts.
Social gerontologists notice that baby boomers have tested
many of the deeply rooted social values and beliefs (Outlaw
et al., 2012), and that this cohort of older adults is more
comfortable with alcohol and drug use, as they may have a
history of substance use from when they were young
(Cummings et al., 2008).
Substance abuse among older people, which is often
under-diagnosed, is a significant public health issue.
Research has documented that alcohol- and drug-related
problems have negative impacts not only on the health and
well-being of individuals but also the social aspects of the
community (Colliver et al., 2006; Manning et al., 2013;
Mitchell, 2011). At the individual level, substance abuse
may exaggerate the normal slowing of reaction times and
other physical functions, among older adults. This may
increase the risk of falls and accidents (Colliver et al., 2006).
At the community and social level, alcohol and drug abuse
presents a major challenge for the criminal justice system,
Prevalence of substance abuse and
socio-economic differences in
substance abuse in an Australian
community-dwelling elderly sample
Wendy Li and Nerina Caltabiano
Abstract
A sample of 324 55­90-year-old Australian adults participated in a survey on elderly substance abuse using the Clinical
Assessment Scales for the Elderly. Overall, males had a higher prevalence rate of substance abuse than females.
Significant differences in substance abuse mean scores were found for gender, age, income, community involvement,
and retirement. The findings also reveal that being a female, involved in community groups, being a retiree, and being
a non-baby boomer are protective factors of substance abuse. Being an upper medium income earner appears to be a
risk factor of substance abuse.

the health system, and worker productivity (Manning et al.,
2013). Alcohol and drug abuses are also identified as risk
factors for domestic violence and road accidents (Manning
et al., 2013; Mitchell, 2011).
Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance by
older adults (Cummings et al., 2008; Li and Jackson,
2016). A review by Briggs et al. (2011) found that an esti-
mated 15
percent of noninstitutionalized people aged
65
years and over were at risk of alcoholism and up to
50
percent of the elderly residents of nursing and retire-
ment facilities drank at least moderately or have problems
related to alcohol use. American studies report the preva-
lence of alcohol abuse in community-dwelling older adults
ranges from 3
percent to 30
percent. The prevalence of
alcohol abuse among older people presenting in healthcare
settings has been consistently higher, ranging from 5per-
cent to 58
percent in hospitals, nursing homes, and other
institutional settings (Cummings et al., 2008; Kane and
Green, 2009; Patterson and Jeste, 1999).
Similar trends of high rates of alcohol abuse among
older people in both community samples and healthcare
settings are found in other countries. A UK prevalence
study of the community mental health service for older
adults reported that 30percent of service users drank above
the national guidelines for safe consumption of alcohol,
and that 10percent of service users drank alcohol at depend-
ence levels (Rakshi and Marron, 2011). In Australia, the
2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare, 2010) found that 15.3per-
cent of people aged 65­74years and 9.4percent of individ-
uals aged over 75
years had high-risk drinking for
alcohol-related harm or injury over the lifetime.
In addition to alcohol, some older adults have also been
found to be drug abusers (Li and Jackson, 2016). These
drugs include prescription drugs and illicit drugs. Older
people are reported to have the highest prescription-drug
abuse rate of any other age group (Briggs et al., 2011).
Among the prescription drugs, benzodiazepines and opioid
analgesics are frequently prescribed to individuals aged
65years and older. In Australia's aged care services, around
4.4percent of residents report misusing opioids or benzodi-
azepines (Li and Jackson, 2016).
The use of illicit drugs may be increasing in the elderly
population as baby boomers age (Cummings et al., 2008).
Illicit drugs include marijuana, hashish, cocaine (including
crack), inhalants, hallucinogens, heroin, and prescription-
type drugs used nonmedically. Latest projections suggest
significant increases in illicit drug use by people aged
50years and older. According to Colliver et al. (2006), mar-
ijuana use among adults aged 50
years and older in the
United States is estimated to reach 3.3million by 2020. In
addition, use of any illicit drug is estimated to reach 3.5mil-
lion, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs (opioids,
sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants) is projected to
reach 2.7
million. While older Australians have generally
had the lowest rates of illicit drug use compared to younger
age groups, recently this age group has begun to show an
increase from 8.7
percent to 11.1
percent for 50­59
year
olds and from 5.1
percent to 6.4
percent for people aged
60
years and over (Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare, 2013). Additionally, about 3
percent of older
Australians have used pain killers or analgesics for non-
medical purposes (Li and Jackson, 2016).
Researchers strive to establish evidence of socio-eco-
nomic variables that correlate to substance abuse in the
elderly population. In the studies that investigate gender dif-
ferences in substance abuse, a consistent finding is that
elderly women are less frequently diagnosed with alcohol
and illicit drug addiction disorders than elderly men (Briggs
et al., 2011; Cummings et al., 2008; Koechl et al., 2012;
Nogueira et al., 2013; Outlaw et al., 2012). However, older
women are often more vulnerable to prescription drug abuse
than are men (Briggs et al., 2011; Li and Jackson, 2016).
The relationship between alcohol abuse and loneliness
among older adults is inconclusive. For example, Briggs
et al. (2011) and Outlaw et al. (2012) suggested that older
people living alone and experiencing isolation, loneliness,
and lack of social support might be more at risk for excessive
substance use as a way to manage life stressors. However,
Canham et al.'s (2016) study reported that in a sample of
community-based adults aged 50
years and over, loneliness
was not associated with at-risk or binge drinking.
The impact of retirement on substance abuse is incon-
clusive. Kuerbis and Sacco (2012) used alcohol abuse as its
example in reviewing the impact of retirement on the drink-
ing patterns of older adults. Several positions appear to pre-
vail on this issue. From a social network and social role
perspective, drinking may decrease for retirees as they are
cut off from their social network of co-workers that encour-
age alcohol consumption (Wood, 2007). Alternatively,
drinking may increase due to greater leisure time and/or
lessened demand from workplace functioning (Kuerbis and
Sacco, 2012). From a stress and coping perspective, retired
older persons may use alcohol to cope with the stress of
retirement. They may also use alcohol to relieve tension
and pain or cope with boredom (Adlaf and Smart, 1995).
Income and education are two important indicators of
socio-economic status. Nevertheless, there is a lack of
empirical evidence on the associations between substance
abuse and the income and education of older adults.
The Australian National Drug Strategy Household
Survey (NDSHS) has been conducted every 2­3years since
1985. It provides the substance abuse prevalence of risky
alcohol consumption and illicit drug usage by age groups
(Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2010, 2013).
For example, in 2013, 20.1
percent, 16.6
percent, and
8.3percent Australians, aged 55­64, 65­74, and 75+years,
respectively, had risky drinking (more than two standard
drinks of alcohol on any day). Male had higher rates of
risky drinking across three age groups. In the previous
Li and Caltabiano 3
12
months, 5.0
percent, 0.9
percent, and 0.2
percent of
Australians, aged 55­64, 65­74, and 75+
years, used can-
nabis, respectively. Male had higher rates of cannabis use
across three age groups. However, it does not assess the
relationship between substance abuse and socio-economic
factors in older Australians. Australia lacks comprehensive
information about the relationships between substance
abuse and socio-economic factors.
To address the aforementioned research gaps, this article
uses a community-dwelling sample of older Australians to
estimate the prevalence of substance abuse in the sample. It
then focuses on the relationships between substance abuse
and gender, age, income, education retirement, living
arrangement, and community involvement. This investiga-
tion of a non-clinical sample will provide a better under-
standing, of the socio-economic risk factors of substance
abuse among older Australians, to community service pro-
viders and practitioners.
Method
Participants and procedure
Respondents were recruited from three state capital and
two regional cities in Australia. Five hundred letters were
sent to randomly selected households in telephone books
to ask whether there were persons aged 55­90years who
were interested in participating in the survey. Thirty-two
responses were received. More than 30 senior citizen
clubs and community groups were approached by research
assistants of the research project. Meetings were organ-
ized by the organizations who were willing to help in
recruiting participants, where the research assistants met
with the prospective participants. Research assistants
explained the purpose of the research project, outlined the
rights of a research participant, distributed the participant
information sheet, and answered any questions the pro-
spective participants had about the project. As a result of
the meetings, 235 respondents were recruited. A snow-
balling technique was also used. Researchers emailed the
details of the study to their networks and/or personal con-
tacts who were asked to forward the emails to their clients
and/or friends. Fifty-seven respondents were recruited. As
a result, a total of 324 respondents took part in the survey.
The ages ranged from 55 to 90years (M=66.78, standard
deviation (SD)
=
8.58). The sample was skewed toward
female respondents with 59.3percent female (n=192) and
40.7percent male (n=132). Table 1 shows a breakdown of
the demographic characteristics of the sample.
Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research
Ethics Committee at James Cook University. Respondents
were informed that the study would be exploring mental
health issues among olderAustralians. Following the provi-
sion of informed consent, the participants completed a pen-
and-paper questionnaire and returned it to the researcher or
used the supplied postage paid envelope.
Materials
Socio-economic variables were measured by gender, age,
individual annual income, education level, retirement sta-
tus, living arrangements, and membership of social/sports/
arts community groups. The scale of Substance Abuse
(SUB) in the Clinical Assessment Scales for the Elderly
(CASE) Form S (self-report) was employed to measure
substance abuse. SUB was chosen because it is specifically
designed to assess substance abuse for older persons aged
between 55 and 90years and can be used in the non-clinical
population (for details of SUB, please see Reynolds and
Bigler, 2001). There were 19 items in SUB. Responses
were recorded using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from
Never, Once a Year or Less, Monthly, Weekly to Daily, or
Always. The higher the score, the more severe is the sub-
stance abuse. Sample questions included "drink to feel bet-
ter," "if I do not have a drink, I start to shake," "rely on
alcohol or drugs too much," and "my family and I quarrel
about my alcohol or drug use." SUB has been demonstrated
to have good reliability, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients
for the scale being .92 (Reynolds and Bigler, 2001). For the
current study, Cronbach's alpha was .83.
The CASE manual recommends that a T score of 75 or
higher suggests an extreme level of substance abuse; T
scores between 65­74 indicate a clinically significant level
of substance abuse; 55­64 for a mild to moderately

elevated level of substance abuse; 45­54 for an average or
typical level of substance abuse; and 44 or lower for a low
to very low level of substance abuse. The present study
used these cut-off T scores to estimate prevalence levels in
this Australian sample. An elevated level of substance
abuse refers to a tendency to use alcohol and/or drug use to
regulate mood, and episodic binge drinking may occur in
the absence of regular use. A clinically significant level of
substance abuse refers to a clear pattern of alcohol and/or
drug abuse. An extreme level of substance abuse refers to
severe alcohol and/or drug use problems of a dependent
nature.
Analysis
Little's Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) test indi-
cated that missing data were missing completely at random
(p=.82). Multiple imputation technique was used to replace
missing data, which generated five sets of imputed data.
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample.
For the estimate of prevalence and analyses of age, income,
and educational differences in substance abuse scores, the
participants were categorized into three age groups, four
income groups, and four educational groups, as shown in
Table 1. To be consistent with the CASE manual (Reynolds
and Bigler, 2001), T scores were chosen to transform raw
scores to standardized scores for the purpose of estimating
the prevalence of substance abuse. T-tests and ANOVAs
were employed to investigate differences of group means.
Results
Prevalence of substance abuse
Table 2 presents the prevalence of substance abuse broken
down by a number of demographic variables.
Socio-economic differences in substance abuse
In order to ascertain socio-economic differences in sub-
stance abuse mean scores, independent samples t-tests were
used to test the differences of the mean scores of substance
abuse between gender (male/female), community involve-
ment (yes/no), retirement (yes/no), and living arrangements
(with people/living alone). In each of these analyses, the
degrees of freedom were higher than expected because the
results were pooled from five imputed datasets using multi-
ple imputation. Analyses of variances (ANOVAs) were
used to test the group differences of the mean scores of sub-
stance abuse in age, income, and education.
Gender difference in substance abuse mean scores.Independ-
ent samples t-tests were used to test the gender difference in
substance abuse mean scores. There was a significant
difference in the scores for men (M=26.90, SD=7.95) and
women (M=23.45, SD=5.84; t(79350)=4.23, p<.001,
two-tailed). This yielded a medium effect size (Cohen's
d
=
.49) for the magnitude of the difference in the means
(mean difference=3.44, 95% CI (1.85, 5.04)).
Age difference in substance abuse mean scores.Participants
were categorized into three groups according to their age
(Group 1: 55­64
years; Group 2: 65­74
years; Group 3:
75years and above). Levene's test indicated that the assump-
tion of homogeneity of variance had not been violated, F(2,
321)=1.10, p=.34. There was a statistically significant dif-
ference in substance abuse scores for the three age groups:
F(2, 321)=2.30, p
=
.05. The actual difference in mean
scores between the groups was small. The effect size calcu-
lated, using eta squared, was .02. Post-hoc comparisons
employing Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD)
test indicated that the mean score for Group 1 (M=25.68,
SD
=
7.25) was significantly different from Group 3
(M=23.24, SD=5.94, p=.04, 95% CI (0.08, 4.81)) with an
almost medium effect size (Cohen's d
=
.37). Group 1 did
not significantly differ from Group 2 (M=24.71, SD=7.08)
and Group 2 did not significantly differ from Group 3.
Income difference in substance abuse mean scores.Partici-
pants were divided into four groups according to their
income (Group 1: low income of $41,599 and less; Group 2:
lower medium income of $41,600­$77,999; Group 3: upper
medium income of $78,000­$129,999; Group 4: high
income of $130,000 and above). Levene's test indicated that
the assumption of homogeneity of variance had not been
violated, F(3, 320)=2.59, p
=
.06. The results showed that
income levels significantly affected the level of substance
abuse reported in participants, F(3, 67)=4.87, p=.003. The
actual difference in mean scores between the groups was
small. Post-hoc comparisons using Tukey's HSD test indi-
cated that the mean score for Group 1 (M=23.77, SD=5.97)
was significantly different from Group 3 (M=28.63,
SD=10.49, p
=
.01, 95% CI (-.12, -.01)) with a medium
effect size (Cohen's d
=
.60). Group 1 did not significantly
differ from either Group 2 (M=25.28, SD=7.27) or Group 4
(M=26.56, SD
=
6.43). The mean scores for Groups 2­4
were not significantly different from one another.
Educational difference in substance abuse scores.Partici-
pants were divided into three groups according to their
education (Group 1: secondary education or below;
Group 2: professional diploma; Group 3: undergraduate;
Group 4: postgraduate). Levene's test indicated that the
assumption of homogeneity of variance had not been vio-
lated, F(3, 320)=1.13, p
=
.34. The results showed that
there was no statistically significant difference in mean
scores of substance abuse for the four educational groups:
F(3, 320)=2.18, p=.09.
Li and Caltabiano 5
Retirement difference in substance abuse mean scores.Inde-
pendent samples t-tests were used to test the retirement dif-
ference in substance abuse mean scores. There was a
significant difference in the scores for non-retirees
(M=25.87, SD
=
7.56) and retirees (M=24.14 SD=6.46;
t(20596)=-2.14, p=.03, two-tailed). Despite reaching sta-
tistical significance, the magnitude of the difference in the
means (mean difference
=
1.73, 95% CI (.14, 3.32)) was
very small (Cohen's d=.25).
Living arrangement difference in substance abuse mean
scores. There was no significant difference in the scores for
participants living with people (M=25.24, SD=7.36) and
living alone (M=23.70, SD=5.55; t(33765)=-.09, p=.09,
two-tailed).
Community involvement difference in substance abuse mean
scores. Independent samples t-tests were used to test the com-
munity involvement difference in substance abuse mean
scores. There was a significant difference in the scores for par-
ticipants who were involved in community groups (M=24.06,
SD
=
6.03) and who were not involved in community groups
(M=26.29, SD=8.25; t(8371)=-2.53, p=.01, two-tailed).
Despite reaching statistical significance, the magnitude of the
difference in the means (mean difference
=
3.44, 95% CI
(-3.96, -.50)) was small (Cohen's d=.31).
Discussion
The present study explored the prevalence of substance
abuse in a community-dwelling sample of olderAustralians.
In general, 11.8percent participants had a tendency to use
alcohol and/or drug use to regulate mood, and episodic
binge drinking may occur in the absence of regular use, and
5.3percent participants had a clear pattern of alcohol and/or
drug abuse; 3.3percent participants had severe alcohol and/
or drug use problems of a dependent nature.
The current research revealed that being a female, a non-
baby boomer, a retiree, and involved in community groups
are protective factors of substance abuse among the partici-
pants. Being an upper medium, income earner appears to be
a risk factor for substance abuse.
Male participants had a higher prevalence of substance
abuse than their female counterparts. The mean score of
substance abuse among males was significantly higher than
that of females. This finding is consistent with findings in
existing literature that elderly men are more frequently diag-
nosed with substance abuse than elderly women (Briggs

et al., 2011; Cummings et al., 2008; Koechl et al., 2012;
Nogueira et al., 2013; Outlaw et al., 2012). Our findings are
also consistent with the finding in NDSHS that theAustralian
older men had higher rates of risky substance use (such as
drinking and cannabis use) than Australian older women
(Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2013).
Pertaining to age, baby boomers had higher substance
abuse rates than the previous age cohorts, with their mean
scores of substance abuse being significantly higher than the
age cohort of 75years and over. This finding is consistent with
the theory that the retirement of baby boomers may result in
unprecedented high numbers of older substance abusers
(Colliver et al., 2006; Compton et al., 2004; Cummings et al.,
2008; Nogueira et al., 2013; Outlaw et al., 2012).
With regard to income, participants with an upper
medium income had the highest substance abuse rates com-
pared with the other income groups. Their mean substance
abuse scores were significantly higher than those of the low
income group. This finding provides empirical evidence
that middle class older people may be more vulnerable to
substance abuse compared to their counterparts in other
income groups.
In relation to retirement status, older retirees had a lower
prevalence rate of substance abuse than those who were
working at the time of the study. The mean score for retir-
ees was significantly lower than that for non-retirees. This
finding is consistent with the social network and social role
theory that social roles are reduced for retired older people,
and therefore, alcohol consumption and related problems
may reduce. This is particularly the case for older people in
workplaces where alcohol use is associated with work-ori-
ented social roles (Kuerbis and Sacco, 2012).
With respect to living arrangements, the participants liv-
ing with others reported higher rates in substance abuse
than those who lived alone, even though the mean sub-
stance score difference between the two groups was not
significant. This finding is not consistent with previous
findings where loneliness is an at-risk factor of substance
abuse among older adults. One of the explanations of this
inconsistency is that people living alone may not necessar-
ily be lonely. Another explanation is that older people, who
live with family or friends and who have physical problems
such as pain, may be encouraged by family members or
friends to use pain medication (Patterson and Jeste, 1999).
Regarding community involvement, participants who
were part of a social/sporting/arts community group had a
lower prevalence rate in substance abuse than their counter-
parts. The mean score of substance abuse among those who
were involved with community groups was significantly
lower than their counterparts. Older people who are not
involved in community activities may be more likely to
experience isolation and a lack of social support, and feel
lonely. Excessive substance use may be employed as a
means to manage isolation and loneliness by some older
adults (Briggs et al., 2011; Outlaw et al., 2012).
There are a number of limitations which warrant future
research. The non-probability sampling method limits the
generalizability of the current findings. A randomized,
larger-size sample would overcome this limitation.
Moreover, as Li and Jackson (2016) suggested that cultural
background may play a role in the gender­substance abuse
relationship, future work may want to consider whether
males irrespective of cultural background are more at-risk
substance abusers than females. Furthermore, future work
may consider the role cultures play in substance abuse of
older Australians. In particular, are older Indigenous
Australians more likely than their mainstream counterparts
to be consuming alcohol at a high-risk level? In addition,
although the manual of CASE states that high scores of
substance abuse always suggest problems associated with
alcohol use, the CASE does not distinguish between alco-
hol and drug abuse, which limits the meaningfulness of the
findings. It is worth assessing abuses of alcohol, prescrip-
tion drug, and illicit drug separately.
Despite the limitations, the article offers insights into the
occurrence of substance abuse among a volunteer sample of
community dwelling over 55
year olds. Health psycholo-
gists working with older people and/or those designing pro-
grams, which aim at preventing substance abuse among
older people, may want to address demographic markers of
their clients in the prevention programs. For example, pre-
vention programs could be developed to address the follow-
ing risk socio-economic factors identified by the present
study: being a male, baby boomer, non-retiree and an upper
medium income earner, and having no involvement in com-
munity groups. Moreover, as the initial wave of the baby
boom generation turned 65years old in 2011 (Kuerbis et al.,
2014), it is important to provide culturally appropriate ser-
vices to this age group due to the uniqueness of this genera-
tion of older adults.
Conclusion
Although the current proportions of older adults inAustralia
with substance abuse remain low compared to younger age
groups, a growing proportion and number of older
Australians are at risk for risky drinking, substance misuse,
and even illicit substance misuse and abuse. The present
research indicates that one in five of the participants experi-
ence substance use that may put them at risk of substance-
related harm in their later life. Being male, baby boomer,
more affluent, non-retiree, and less involved in community
activities are associated with substance use among the older
people in the current study.
