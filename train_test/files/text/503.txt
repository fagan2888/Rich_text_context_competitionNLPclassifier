Objectives: To better understand variations in classification of deaths of undetermined intent among states
in the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS).
Design: Data from the NVDRS and the National Vital Statistics System were used to compare differences
among states.
Main outcome measures: Percentages of deaths assigned undetermined intent, rates of deaths of
undetermined intent, rates of fatal poisonings broken down by cause of death, composition of poison types
within the undetermined-intent classification.
Results: Three states within NVDRS (Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island) evidenced increased
numbers of deaths of undetermined intent. These same states exhibited high rates of undetermined death
and, more specifically, high rates of undetermined poisoning deaths. Further, these three states evidenced
correspondingly lower rates of unintentional poisonings. The types of undetermined poisonings present in
these states, but not present in other states, are typically the result of a combination of recreational drugs,
alcohol, or prescription drugs.
Conclusions: The differing classification among states of many poisoning deaths has implications for the
analysis of undetermined deaths within the NVDRS and for the examination of possible/probable suicides
contained within the undetermined- or accidental-intent classifications. The NVDRS does not collect
information on unintentional poisonings, so in most states data are not collected on these possible/
probable suicides. The authors believe this is an opportunity missed to understand the full range of self-
harm deaths in the greater detail provided by the NVDRS system. They advocate a broader interpretation
of suicide to include the full continuum of deaths resulting from self-harm.
Much of the difficulty in conceptualizing and measur-
ing violent death lies in the implicit nature of
intentionality, particularly for suicide. Perhaps stem-
ming from this difficulty, a number of studies have
concluded that suicides are underreported because of the
misallocation of suicide verdicts to other manners of death,
such as the ``accidental'' or undetermined classifications.1­6
Some have argued that the standard of proof (that is,
typically ``beyond a reasonable doubt'') used by coroners/
medical examiners (C/ME) for legal reasons is a standard
that is artificially high for public health purposes, and may
result in the systematic exclusion of particular types of
suicides.4 7 The difficulty of ascertaining a decedent's intent,
combined with the legally defined burden of proof, likely
restricts the full range of deaths due to self-harm from
inclusion in violent death surveillance systems.
When intent cannot be established at the legally defined
level, many possible or probable suicides are classified as
undetermined in nature.1­4 7 8 General guidelines issued by
the National Association of Medical Examiners state that the
undetermined manner-of-death classification is to be used
``when the information pointing to one manner of death is no
more compelling than one or more other competing manners
of death in thorough consideration of all available informa-
tion''.9 Of the 161 269 resident injury deaths reported in the
US in 2002, 3.0% were of undetermined manner (intent).10
Despite deaths of undetermined intent comprising a rela-
tively small percentage of injury deaths, disaggregating these
data reveals troubling patterns and cause for concern.
Of particular concern, the misclassification of suicides and
homicides as deaths of undetermined intent results in
underreporting of official suicide and homicide rates for
certain demographic subgroups.8 11­14 Further complicating
matters, certain elements of a violent death may system-
atically influence whether a death is classified as undeter-
mined in nature. These factors include: the mechanism of
death,1 5­7 15 whether the decedent left explicit or circum-
stantial evidence of intention,1 7 16 the quantity and quality of
information available to the C/ME making the determina-
tion,14 17 and differing criteria among C/MEs about the
classification of certain types of deaths.18 While some of
these factors are indicative of intentionality, each is
independent of the decedent's true intentions and may result
in a skewed picture of violent deaths.
Likely related to several of the aforementioned factors,
considerable variability exists across both states and coun-
tries in terms of the frequency and rates of deaths of
undetermined intent.10 19 In many states, the undetermined
category is used infrequently. In others, it represents a large
proportion of violent deaths. As a cause of death, poisoning
accounts for an increasingly large proportion of injury deaths
of undetermined intent in the US. Between 1979 and 2002,
the percentage of undetermined injury deaths due to
poisoning rose from 32% to 69%. More than half (54%) of
the undetermined-intent poisoning deaths in 2002 were due
to narcotics and hallucinogens.10 Here, we suggest that
difficulty in judging intentionality, coupled with differing
C/ME philosophies on classifying manner of death, are
largely responsible for variations among jurisdictions, parti-
cularly in cases of self-inflicted drug overdose (poisoning)
deaths.

In addition to reviewing state-level variation in rates of
manner-undetermined deaths, this research extends knowl-
edge based on death certificates alone by taking advantage of
added details on violent death investigations that are
available from states participating in the US National
Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS links
data from C/MEs, police reports, death certificates, and like
sources to produce a more detailed record of the character-
istics and circumstances surrounding violent deaths, includ-
ing those of undetermined manner or intent. We suspect, as
have others, that variations across time and place in the
amount and quality of information available describing the
circumstances surrounding unnatural deaths likely have a
direct impact on judgments of intent.14 We believe that such
variations reduce the validity and reliability of statistics on
violent death. At the same time, we argue that improved
collection of accurate and detailed information on fatal
injuries that result from high risk behaviors, regardless of the
decedents' intentions, can lead to better and more effective
violence prevention efforts.
METHODS
Data sources
We used two sources of data in this analysis to explore
patterns of manner-undetermined death: the NVDRS and the
Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System
(WISQARS) which draws on mortality data from the US
National Vital Statistics System. Standard descriptive statis-
tics were used to compare groups. Two-sample t tests,
assuming equal variances, were computed to compare group
means.
The NVDRS is a state-based, active surveillance system that
collects information on all homicides, suicides, deaths of
undetermined intent, deaths resulting from legal interven-
tion (except legal executions), and deaths from unintentional
firearm injuries. State health departments participating in
the NVDRS typically identify these violent deaths as their
death certificates are filed and then establish details of the
cases from C/ME and law enforcement records. Details
collected include the circumstances contributing to the
deaths, interpersonal relationships, and toxicology results.
Seven states (Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia) provided NVDRS data
in 2003. Six additional states (Colorado, Georgia, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) provided
NVDRS data in 2004. In 2003, these 13 states represented
23.4% of the US population and accounted for about 23.4% of
the suicides, 22.7% of the homicides, and 42.1% of the
manner-undetermined deaths.20
Violent deaths in the NVDRS are initially defined by
International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-
10) codes; NVDRS coders then review all pieces of evidence
and assign a manner consistent with NVDRS coding
practices.21 The manner of death used in the NVDRS analysis
presented here is the abstractor-assigned manner of death.
There are other differences in the NVDRS case definition, as
noted elsewhere.21 22
The NVDRS makes a unique contribution to injury
surveillance in that information about circumstances related
to suicide, undetermined deaths, homicides, and uninten-
tional firearm injuries are linked together from multiple
sources in a single, incident-level database. The NVDRS does
not collect information on unintentional deaths, aside from
firearm related unintentional deaths, so detailed examination
of these cases was not possible. Additional information about
the NVDRS design, methods, and variable definitions are
available elsewhere.21 22
WISQARS data are collected by Centers for Disease Control
(CDC)'s National Center for Health Statistics from death
certificates registered in each of the 50 states and the District
of Columbia. These data are compiled by CDC's National
Center for Injury Prevention and Control from the National
Vital Statistics System and made available online.20
Aggregated WISQARS data for 1999 through 2003 were
calculated to compare NVDRS states with the remaining 50
states and the District of Columbia. Age adjusted rates were
computed as deaths per 100 000 residents using the 2000
standard population (for all races and both sexes). Rates
represented an annual average computed over five years.
Violent deaths in WISQARS were identified by the
following ICD-10 codes: deaths of undetermined intent
(Y10­Y34, Y87.2, Y89.9), including undetermined-intent
poisoning deaths (Y10­Y19); suicidal poisoning deaths
(X60­X69); and unintentional poisoning deaths (X40­X49).
These groupings are based on manner and cause information
that are translated by nosologists from the manner of death
checkbox and write-in cause of death blanks on death
certificates filled in by C/MEs and other death certifiers.
Although one might expect a great deal of agreement
between the WISQARS/ICD-10 code intent groupings and
NVDRS abstractor-assigned manner of death, it has not been
established heretofore.
RESULTS
Percentage of undetermined deaths by state
Using NVDRS data, an examination of manner-undeter-
mined deaths as a percentage of all violent deaths in each
state reveals stark differences for several states (table 1). In
2003, 60.0% (874 of 1456) of all violent deaths in
Massachusetts were classified as manner-undetermined,
while 42.4% (775 of 1829) of Maryland's deaths were
classified similarly. The percentage of undetermined deaths
in the remaining five NVDRS states was 7.0% (302 of 4292),
with the largest percentage of undetermined death in Oregon
(13.7%, 116 of 844). In 2003, Maryland and Massachusetts
comprised 84.5% (1649 of 1951) of manner-undetermined
deaths within the NVDRS, but only 33.8% (685 of 2023) of
homicides and 26.4% (951 of 3603) of suicides.
The pattern in 2004 was similar even with the participation
of six additional states in the NVDRS. In Massachusetts,
50.1% (635 of 1268) of all violent deaths were classified as
manner-undetermined, while 38.1% (594 of 1560) of all
deaths in Maryland were classified similarly. In addition,
Rhode Island evidenced a high rate of undetermined death
(49.8%; 120 of 241) in its first year of NVDRS participation.
The rate of undetermined death in the remaining 10 NVDRS
states for 2004 was 7.1% (718 of 10 135) with the largest rate
in Oklahoma (17.3%, 155 of 897). In 2004, Maryland,
Massachusetts, and Rhode Island comprised 65.3% (1349 of
2067) of the manner-undetermined deaths in the 13 states
collecting data, but only 18.9% (710 of 3758) of homicides
and 13.7% (1010 of 7379) of suicides.
Rates of undetermined deaths in WISQARS
To compare NVDRS data with the rest of the US and the
District of Columbia, we analyzed WISQARS data from 1999
to 2003, the most recent years for which data were available.
A summary of results found using WISQARS data is
presented in table 2. From 1999 to 2003, Maryland,
Massachusetts, and Rhode Island ranked first, third, and
fourth (out of 51), respectively, in terms of the annualized
average age adjusted rate of undetermined death. More
important, the mean rate of undetermined-manner deaths in
these three states (mean 9.21 per 100 000, SD 1.80; range
7.95­11.27) was statistically different from the mean rate
(mean 1.25 per 100 000, SD 0.79; range 0.48­2.65) in the
other NVDRS states (difference in means 7.96; 95% CI 6.44 to
9.48).

Over the 1999­2003 period, 93.1% (5895 of 6331) of all
manner-undetermined deaths in Maryland, Massachusetts,
and Rhode Island were due to poisoning. Maryland,
Massachusetts, and Rhode Island ranked first, third, and
fourth, respectively, in their five-year annualized age
adjusted rates for poisoning deaths of undetermined intent.
More importantly, the mean rate of undetermined-intent
poisonings in these three states (mean 8.55 per 100 000, SD
1.68; range 7.35­10.47) was significantly different from the
mean rate (mean 0.64 per 100 000, SD 0.48; range 0.24­1.63)
in the other NVDRS states (difference in means 7.92; 95% CI
6.70 to 9.13).
The large differences in rates between these two groups
suggest that many undetermined-intent poisonings in
Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island would have
been classified as either suicides or as unintentional deaths
had they occurred in other states.
We considered these possibilities in the two rightmost
panels of table 2, comparing state rankings and rates of
suicidal and unintentional poisonings with those discussed
previously.
In contrast to their top ranks for undetermined-intent
poisoning, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island
ranked 44th, 43rd, and 38th, respectively, in the rate of
suicidal poisonings. However, the mean rate of suicidal
poisonings in these three states (mean 1.51 per 100 000, SD
0.12; range 1.43­1.65) was not significantly different from
the mean rate (mean 2.07 per 100 000, SD 0.64; range
1.3223.37) in other NVDRS states (difference in means
20.562; 95% CI 21.40 to 0.27).
The pattern is even more pronounced for unintentional
poisoning deaths during the same five-year period:
Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island ranked 49th,
50th, and 51st, respectively. More important, the mean rate
of unintentional poisonings in these three states (mean 0.99
per 100 000, SD 0.08; range 0.9321.08) was significantly
different from the mean rate (mean 5.59 per 100 000,
SD 1.74; range 4.01210.27) in the other NVDRS states

(difference in means 24.91; 95% CI 27.19 to 22.62). This
result, combined with the high rate of undetermined-intent
poisonings in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island,
indicates that many undetermined poisonings in those states
are likely being classified as unintentional poisonings in
other NVDRS states. Figure 1 illustrates the inverse relation-
ship between rates of undetermined-manner deaths and
unintentional poisoning deaths among NVDRS states using
WISQARS data.
Poison types in the NVDRS
According to 2003 NVDRS data, 1465 deaths of undetermined
manner occurred in which a poison was noted in the record.
Of these, 1353 (92.4%) occurred in Maryland or
Massachusetts. The same pattern was found in 2004; 1047
out of 1237 (84.6%) undetermined poisonings were found in
Maryland, Massachusetts, or Rhode Island. In 2003, six
classifications of poisonings comprised most undetermined
poisoning cases: 440 deaths due to prescription drugs only
(86.4% in Maryland/Massachusetts), 403 deaths due to
street/recreational drugs only (97.3% in Maryland/
Massachusetts), 262 deaths due to ``other combination of
substances'' (96.9% in Maryland/Massachusetts), 121 deaths
due to street/recreational drugs and prescription drugs
(97.0% in Maryland/Massachusetts), 78 deaths due to alcohol
and prescription drugs (91.0% in Maryland/Massachusetts),
and 67 deaths due to alcohol and street/recreational drugs
(97.0% in Maryland/Massachusetts). Results from this
analysis of NVDRS data are summarized in table 3.
In 2004, these same six classifications of poisonings
comprised most undetermined poisoning cases: 444 deaths
due to prescription drugs only (73.0% in Maryland/
Massachusetts/Rhode Island), 285 deaths due to street/
recreational drugs only (92.6% in Maryland/Massachusetts/
Rhode Island), 155 deaths due to ``other combination of
substances'' (95.5% in Maryland/Massachusetts/Rhode
Island), 127 deaths due to street/recreational drugs and
prescription drugs (92.1% in Maryland/Massachusetts/Rhode
Island), 72 deaths due to alcohol and prescription drugs
(93.1% in Maryland/Massachusetts/Rhode Island), and 50
deaths due to alcohol and street/recreational drugs (98.0% in
Maryland/Massachusetts/Rhode Island).
The comparison of high rate versus low rate undetermined-
manner NVDRS states is complicated by differential reporting
of poisoning type across the two groups. In 2003, Maryland
and Massachusetts together reported type of poison in 82%
(1353 of 1649) of cases while the five low rate undetermined-
manner states reported type of poison in only 37% (112 of
302) of cases. In 2004, the addition of Rhode Island to the
high rate group reduced poison type reporting to 78% (1047
of 1349) of cases while the reporting rate dropped to 26%
(190 of 718) of cases in the low rate group of 10 states. Given
this, computing significance tests of poison type differences
between the two groups is not warranted until the question
of differential reporting bias can be ruled out.
DISCUSSION
The number of deaths classified by NVDRS abstractors as
undetermined in manner varies considerably among states
participating in the NVDRS. This confirms patterns based on
ICD-10 classifications found among the 50 US states and the
District of Columbia. In particular, Massachusetts, Maryland,
and Rhode Island tend to have more manner-undetermined
deaths than other states. In addition, these states contribute

a disproportionate percentage of the overall number of
undetermined deaths within the NVDRS. Using WISQARS
data, we found that these three states' poisonings comprise a
large majority of the manner-undetermined deaths. Further,
when comparing these states with all others and the District
of Columbia, we found that they have a substantially higher
rate of undetermined death and, more specifically, substan-
tially higher rates of undetermined poisonings. We also
found that the states with substantially higher rates of
undetermined poisoning tend to have low rates of uninten-
tional poisoning. Finally, NVDRS data suggest that the
poisons involved in most undetermined poisoning deaths in
Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island are some
combination of recreational drugs, alcohol, or prescription
drugs. The only undetermined poisoning deaths found in
significant numbers in other NVDRS states were deaths in
which prescription drugs alone were implicated, although
differential reporting of poison types across states make this a
very tentative finding.
The data indicate that C/MEs in Maryland, Massachusetts,
and Rhode Island are more likely than C/MEs in other
NVDRS states to classify a poisoning death as undetermined,
particularly when a combination of prescription drugs,
recreational drugs, or alcohol is implicated. We suspect,
based on the WISQARS data, that in other NVDRS states
similar poisonings were classified as unintentional. However,
we were unable to examine this possibility directly using
NVDRS because data on most unintentional deaths (that is,
those that are not firearm related) are not collected by the
system.
The discrepancies in the classification of poisoning deaths
found here may reflect a lack of consensus among C/MEs.
This is a critical issue for public health surveillance,
particularly the NVDRS, because decisions about intent can
significantly affect the validity of violent death data. Further,
given the variation we found among states for poisoning
deaths, variation in other types of deaths likely exists, albeit
in less striking numbers. Future studies might examine this
possibility. Future studies might also consider whether
guidelines for manner-of-death classification disseminated
by the National Association of Medical Examiners, particu-
larly for the classification of poisoning deaths, can be made
clearer.
This study's findings have implications for the analysis and
interpretation of future studies examining undetermined
deaths using NVDRS data. Because of the apparently
discrepant criteria used for the classification of poisoning
deaths in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, the
data for undetermined deaths in these states are not directly
comparable with other states' deaths of undetermined intent.
Therefore, when analyzing undetermined deaths in the
NVDRS, we recommend that researchers perform separate
analyses: one for Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode
Island, and another for the remaining states. An alternative
strategy would be to analyze undetermined poisonings
separately from other undetermined deaths. Performing
separate analyses allows an examination of undetermined
deaths which factors out the very large effect caused by
differing criteria among states in classifying manner-unde-
termined poisonings.
Finally, even though the criteria Maryland, Massachusetts,
and Rhode Island use in defining undetermined intent
appear to be much more liberal than those of most other
states, the increased number of undetermined deaths that
they contribute to the NVDRS represents an excellent
opportunity for studying a wider range of fatal self-injurious
behaviors. Previous researchers have speculated that violent
death surveillance systems significantly undercount suicide3
because C/MEs typically classify a death as suicide only when
significant evidence exists to indicate suicidal intent.
However, many who die by suicide do not provide such
evidence, particularly those who experience ambivalence
about suicide. Little detail is known about people who die
by suicide without a clear indication of intent because their
deaths have typically been classified as undetermined or
accidental in nature. However, those who experience
ambivalence about suicide may provide the best opportunity
for intervention given their doubts about taking their own
life.
Previous researchers have discussed the need to examine
the entire continuum of intentionality for self-injurious
deaths.23 24 Our study indicates that, within the NVDRS, such
an examination would require looking not only at manner-
undetermined deaths for possible/probable suicides, but also
at some deaths classified as unintentional. In essence, it
would require defining self-harm in a way that is less
concerned with C/ME verdict and more concerned with the
behavior that resulted in the death. We therefore recommend
future expansion of the NVDRS case inclusion criteria to
cover all deaths involving self-harm, regardless of intent.
While this may come at increased cost to the NVDRS system
it is worth noting that Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode
Island collect information on many, if not most, of these
deaths already.
Until unintentional deaths can be examined for possible/
probable suicides, the unique collection of circumstance,
toxicology, and situational variables of the NVDRS should be
used to explore all available clues in deaths of undetermined
intent. The many deaths of undetermined manner in
Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island may provide
an especially good opportunity to examine a wider portion of
the continuum of intentionality among violent deaths.

Key points
N Significant variation exists among NVDRS states in the
overall number and rates of manner-undetermined
deaths; among those states with elevated numbers,
most of the manner-undetermined deaths are due to
poisoning.
N States that have many manner-undetermined poison-
ing deaths also tend to have few unintentional
poisoning deaths, suggesting different criteria for the
classification of poisoning deaths in some states.
N Results point to the need for consideration of a wider
range of the continuum of intentionality, from those
who leave evidence of suicidal intent to those who may
be ambivalent and less likely to leave such evidence.
N Within the NVDRS, this might mean examining both
manner-undetermined and unintentional deaths for
possible/probable suicides.
N Results have implications for the analysis of manner-
undetermined deaths in the NVDRS, namely that states
with high rates of undetermined poisoning deaths
should be analyzed separately from those with low
rates.
