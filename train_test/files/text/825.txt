DataWatch
Small Employers And The Health Insurance Market
by Michael A. Morrisey, Gail A. Jensen, and Robert J. Morlock
Abstract: In 1993 half of all small businesses (fewer than fifty workers) sponsored a health plan for
their employees, up from 41 percent in 1989. While not as deep, the benefits offered by small firms
are nearly as broad as benefits offered by large firms, and they have expanded since 1989. Small
businesses pay more for coverage, however. Although coverage restrictions based on health status and
preexisting conditions are a significant concern of small firms, actual limits of this type in the
small-group market are modest. Firms not offering insurance report that they have wide access to
coverage, and many would sponsor a plan if only prices were lower.
Recent efforts to reform the health insurance market have focused on
employers and their coverage of workers. It is more correct, however,
to say that these efforts were targeted at small businesses, because a
large percentage of the uninsured are associated with small businesses.
Estimates from the March 1993 Current Population Survey (CPS) indicate
that 37 percent of the uninsured work for a firm employing fewer than
twenty-five workers that does not provide insurance, and 14 percent of the
uninsured work for such a firm having twenty-five to ninety-nine workers.1
Much about the market for health insurance among small firms remains
poorly understood. The purpose of this DataWatch is to build on the existing
literature and present findings from a new survey of small employers.
Data and methods. The information presented here on the health
benefits offered by small businesses comes from a survey we conducted in
spring 1993. During April and May of that year, National Research, Inc., a
survey research firm in Washington, D.C., conducted telephone interviews
with 750 small businesses employing fewer than fifty workers. The sample
of firms was drawn randomly from the Dun and Bradstreet list of the
nation's private employers, after stratification by size and location. This list
is representative of firms that have applied for a loan at some point and on
which a credit check has been conducted. As such, it may underrepresent

very young firms and some small sole proprietorships.2 In all, 1,721 busi-
nesses were contacted, and 750 agreed to participate. This response rate of
44 percent is typical of small-business surveys.3
To produce nationally representative estimates, we weighted responses
by size and region in accordance with the probability of selection into the
sample. Our focus here is on employers, although in some instances we
present statistics on employees. The margin of error for estimates made from
our 1993 survey is approximately plus or minus four percentage points.
We also draw on data from the Health Insurance Association of Amer-
ica's (HIAA's) annual employer surveys conducted each spring, 1989--
1992. We restrict our focus with these data to employers, other than units
of government, that employed fewer than fifty workers at the time they
were surveyed. There were 844 such firms in the 1989 survey; 763 in 1990;
1,250 in 1991; and 834 in 1992. In each of these years the HIAA drew its
sample of private employers from Dun and Bradstreet's nationwide list of
firms--the same sampling frame we used. We exploit these commonalties
to examine the trend in coverage among small firms over the past five years.
As with our 1993 data, we weight firms' responses to these HIAA surveys to
produce nationally representative estimates for each year that reflect the
entire population of small firms with fewer than fifty workers.4
Who Offers Coverage?
Half (51 percent) of small businesses offered health insurance in 1993.
This is strongly related to firm size (Exhibit 1). Among firms with twenty-
five to forty-nine workers, 85 percent provided insurance coverage, a preva-
lence rate approaching that of medium and large employers. In contrast,
firms with fewer than ten workers were more likely not to offer coverage;
even among this group, however, 44 percent provided insurance. Thus, as
earlier studies have found, mostly very small firms do not provide coverage.5
Lack of coverage is also related to corporate status and location. Nearly
twice as many incorporated firms as unincorporated firms provided health
insurance coverage. Unincorporated firms accounted for 40 percent of all
firms and 27 percent of all employers in our sampling frame. Small busi-
nesses in rural areas, which employ a third of all workers in small businesses
nationwide, were less likely than small businesses in urban areas to offer
coverage (43 percent versus 54 percent).
Small-firm coverage declined between 1989 and 1991 but has increased
steadily since then. At first this appears to be inconsistent with CPS data,
which indicate the opposite.6 Our results may not be inconsistent, however.
First, in fall 1990 the economy slipped into recession and unemployment
increased, largely because firms cut their work forces.7 Firms that did so

would show up as smaller firms in our 1992 and 1993 samples. If they
continued to offer health insurance after downsizing, then estimates of the
percentage of small firms offering coverage in 1992 and 1993 would be
higher, which is what we found.
Second, it is important to understand the factors that underlie the trend
in the CPS numbers. These factors would not suggest that fewer small firms
are now offering health insurance. Since 1989 spells of unemployment and
complete withdrawal from the labor force have become more common
among the nonelderly population.8 These changes in the labor market have
contributed to an increase in the uninsured population but would not
necessarily affect the proportion of small firms providing coverage.
In addition, since 1989 the composition of the labor force has shifted
more toward part-time workers, who are far less likely to receive employer-
sponsored coverage. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that be-
tween 1989 and 1992 there was a loss of 639,000 full-time jobs in the U.S.
economy. At the same time, there was an increase of 894,000 part-time
jobs.9 This trend alone can account for an increase of approximately 1.5

million workers without health insurance between 1989 and 1992.
Our data suggest that small firms are similar to other employers in terms
of who is eligible for coverage. Among small firms that offered insurance
benefits, 97 percent indicated that full-time employees were eligible. Most
firms (85 percent) also covered workers' dependents. However, only 19
percent of small firms provided coverage for part-time workers. Given the
tendency of some states' small-firm coverage demonstrations to exclude the
owner of the firm from coverage, it is important to note that 80 percent of
small firms covered the owner or owners of the business. If owners are
excluded, the desirability of a plan is likely to be reduced significantly.
What Sort Of Coverage Do Small Firms Provide?
Most small businesses with insurance offer a single conventional health
insurance plan. Nearly 60 percent offered this and nothing else (Exhibit 2).
Health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organiza-
tions (PPOs), and point-of-service plans have made only limited inroads
into small firms. Six percent of small firms that offered health insurance
coverage offered an HMO exclusively. Another 10 percent offered a PPO
only. The use of HMOs, PPOs, and point-of-service plans generally in-
creases with firm size. However, only 2 percent of small employers offered
more than one health insurance plan. Those small firms offering multiple
plans almost without exception had twenty-five or more workers.
The benefits provided by small firms are nearly as broad as those provided
by large firms. Small firms' plans tend to cover the same categories of care,
for example. Respondents who knew what their health plan covers reported
that 75 percent covered alcohol abuse treatment, 93 percent covered inpa-
tient mental health care, and 81 percent covered outpatient mental health
services.10 Fifty-eight percent of conventional plans offered by small firms

covered well-baby care, and 53 percent covered routine physical exams,
whereas in large firms' conventional plans, coverage rates for these services
were less than one-quarter. The services covered by conventional and PPO
plans offered by small businesses have actually expanded slightly since
1989, but HMO benefits show slight shrinkage from 1989 levels.11 The
differences were not statistically significant. The similarity between cover-
age offered by large and small firms is consistent with the experience of
states in offering "bare-bones" insurance coverage to small employers.12
Small-firm plans require greater cost sharing than large-firm plans do. In
conventional plans offered by small firms, for example, the average annual
deductible in 1993 was $311 per individual and $694 per family, whereas in
large firms (1,000 or more workers) it was $222 per individual and $498 per
family.13 The cost-sharing provisions of PPOs were also less generous in
small firms: The average in-plan deductible per person in firms with fewer
than fifty workers was $266, and the average out-of-plan deductible was
$1,073, compared with $161 and $286, respectively, in large firms. Lifetime
maximum benefits also tended to be somewhat lower in the smallest firms.
Although their coverage is typically not as deep, small firms pay premi-
ums close to those paid by large firms. For conventional plan coverage, for
example, small firms paid $187 monthly per individual and $425 per family,
on average, in 1993. Large firms paid $171 and $447, respectively. Even
adjusting for the content of coverage, premiums were not significantly
different. We compared premiums for plans that had the following charac-
teristics: a deductible between $100 and $250 per individual, eighty/twenty
coinsurance, a stop-loss amount less than $2,000, a prescription drug bene-
fit, and coverage for several special services, including inpatient and out-
patient mental health care, alcohol and drug abuse treatment, and occupa-
tional therapy. Small firms with plans that fit this prototype paid $164 per
individual and $405 per family, on average, compared with $172 and $429,
respectively, in large firms. Premiums (around these averages) also did not
vary much between small and large firms.14
Why Do More Small Firms Not Offer Coverage?
We asked those small firms that did not provide health insurance why
they did not. Exhibit 3 reports their responses. Not surprisingly, the most
common answer was that premiums were too high.15 Firms with twenty-five
to forty-nine workers that did not offer insurance were especially likely to
give this as an important reason. However, the other answers provide more
insight as to why the coverage was not perceived to be worth the premium.
We have grouped small firms' responses into three related issues. First is
fear of having to take away coverage in the future. Some 56 percent of

respondents that did not offer coverage said that this was a very important
or somewhat important concern. However, nearly 80 percent expressed
concern that the firm's profits were too variable, and three-quarters said
that premium increases were too uncertain. Second, health benefits are not
a high priority among some workers. Nearly 60 percent of responding firms
indicated that they do not have to offer insurance benefits to attract
workers. Fifty-four percent indicated that workers prefer higher wages, and
a nearly identical percentage reported that workers were already covered.
One-third of respondents said that employee turnover is too high to war-
rant providing coverage. Third, just over half of the small firms not offering
coverage (especially those with fewer than ten workers) cited administra-
tive hassles and inability to qualify for group rates as prime concerns.
Some 17 percent of firms not now offering coverage offered it at some
time in the past but no longer do so. Sixty percent of these have done this
since 1990. Two-thirds of firms that have dropped coverage blamed their
action on substantially higher insurance premiums. Still, 45 percent of
small firms that dropped coverage indicated that most of their workers were
covered elsewhere, and 28 percent said that their workers preferred higher

wages to more expensive health insurance. Only 9 percent reported that
their insurer would not renew their policy.
Would Small Firms Offer Coverage If The Price Were Lower?
Not surprisingly, the answer to whether small firms would offer insurance
if the price were lower depends upon the price. We asked small firms that
did not offer health insurance what market scenarios would lead them to
begin offering coverage to their workers. We described an insurance plan to
these firms and offered it at various hypothetical prices. The plan had broad
conventional coverage with cost-sharing provisions similar to what one
might find in a large firm. We told respondents that the plan would cover
all categories of care, would allow workers to choose any physician, and
would entail a $250 annual deductible per person. Forty percent of small
firms not now providing benefits said that they would offer this policy to
their workers if it could be purchased for $ 175 per worker per month. If the
monthly premium were 15 percent lower ($149), 53 percent would pur-
chase the plan, and if it were 50 percent lower ($88), 75 percent would
purchase it. Overall, this implies a premium elasticity of-0.92.
This elasticity is well below that found in econometric studies of insur-
ance demand. Other researchers have found that a 5 percent increase in
price resulted in a 10 to 15 percent decrease in the likelihood of purchase;
that a 5 percent decrease in the tax subsidy for health insurance would
decrease the proportion of firms offering insurance by about 15 percent; and
that a 5 percent increase in premiums would reduce the proportion of small
firms sponsoring an insurance plan by 13 percent.16
On the other hand, these findings are much greater than those implied
by the evaluations of state subsidy programs for small businesses.17 The
findings of these demonstration projects, however, may be biased down-
ward relative to a more general small-firm subsidy for health insurance. It
has been observed that small-business owners had little knowledge of the
plans in the demonstrations, the subsidies were available for only a limited
time period, and, in some instances, owners were not eligible for coverage.
Our survey data on a variety of state initiatives indicate that no more than
9 percent of small employers in states with such initiatives were aware of
them. Further, as noted above, there was a fear that health benefits might
have to be withdrawn. If such a fear is sincere, an eighteen-month subsidy
may not be sufficient to induce many firms to sponsor insurance coverage.
Is Health Insurance Available To Small Firms?
The previous discussion presumes that small employers can find health

insurance. It also suggests that small employers would be willing to change
health plans if they could find plans that offered better service and/or lower
premiums. To address these issues, we asked currently insured and unin-
sured small firms how often they had been solicited to purchase health
insurance in the past six months and whether they had followed up on any
of these solicitations. More than 75 percent of both insured and uninsured
small firms were solicited for health insurance in the past six months, and
more than one-third indicated that they received six or more inquiries.
This is consistent with case study work by Catherine McLaughlin, who also
found numerous sellers of insurance in the small-group market.18 Thus, it
would appear that small firms, for the most part, have ample opportunity to
obtain coverage or change carriers. Simple regressions on the number of
solicitations by firm characteristics found few statistically significant differ-
ences between firms that were solicited and firms that were not. Forty
percent of currently insured firms and 22 percent of uninsured firms indi-
cated that they recently had followed up With one or more of these insur-
ance solicitations. Further, at renewal time, one-third of insured small firms
reported that they had talked to more than one health insurance agent.
Given the interest in purchasing cooperatives and health alliances in
recent health care reform proposals, we asked small firms whether they had
investigated the option of purchasing health insurance through "a local
business association, trade group, employer coalition, or some other group
of small purchasers." Fifty-nine percent of those providing health insurance
said that they had done so. However, only 17 percent indicated that their
current plan was part of such an organization.
Are Health Status And Preexisting Conditions Major Issues?
We asked small employers that have maintained coverage with a given
carrier for two or more years why they have done so: "Is it because you fear
that the current health conditions of some employees or their dependents
would not be covered by a new carrier?" Nearly one-third of respondents
(32 percent) indicated yes to this query; 64 percent said no. The remaining
4 percent did not know. Clearly, a sizable number of insured small firms are
concerned about the coverage implications of changing carriers.
McLaughlin reported that many insurers are unwilling to cover groups
with fewer than ten workers and that many exclude specific industries and
impose preexisting condition clauses. Wendy Zellers and colleagues re-
ported that two-thirds of the insurance firms they surveyed excluded some
industries.19 Indeed, for these reasons state governments have passed legis-
lation limiting medical underwriting, providing for guaranteed issue, and
limiting or eliminating preexisting condition clauses.20

However, the actual extent of coverage exclusion or denial appears to be
much smaller (Exhibit 4). Among firms not offering health insurance
coverage, 39 percent said that "their inability to qualify for an insurance
contract at employer rates" was a very important factor in not providing
coverage. Another 15 percent said that this was a somewhat important
factor. "Inability to qualify" can stem from a variety of factors. Of those who
cited this as a somewhat or very important reason for not offering coverage,
we asked if this was because "one or more employees cannot qualify for
insurance because of health conditions." More than three-quarters (77
percent) answered no; only 18 percent said yes. Inability to qualify also may
relate to the risk classification associated with a particular firm or industry.
This too may be related to the real or perceived health status of the firm's
workers. However, only 14 percent of those blaming "inability to qualify"
indicated that "the type of business or industry they are in makes them
ineligible."
Further, as noted earlier, 17 percent of those not now offering coverage
said that they provided it before but no longer do. Of these firms, 60 percent
dropped their plan since 1990. When asked if an insurer's refusal to renew
was a reason for dropping coverage, only 9 percent indicated that it was.
Only 3 percent indicated that the inability of one or more employees to
qualify was a reason.
A second healtlvrelated reason for not changing health insurance carri-
ers has to do with waiting periods and preexisting condition clauses. Only
20 percent of small firms reported that full-time employees are immediately
eligible for coverage (Exhibit 5). However, most contracts (74 percent)

allow eligibility by the end of three months of employment. These waiting
times are comparable to those set by large firms.21
A few small firms indicated that some of their workers or dependents
were considered ineligible for insurance coverage because of poor health.
However, this situation is rare; 88 percent said that all of their workers (and
their dependents) were eligible for coverage. Conventional insurance
plans, followed by point-of-service and PPO plans, were the most likely to
exclude particular workers or dependents from coverage.
Finally, preexisting health condition clauses are very common; however,
virtually all are for one year or less, and more than half of the workers in
insuring small firms have either no restrictions or limits of one to three
months. These provisions also are comparable to preexisting condition
clauses in very large firms; they are certainly no more restrictive.22

Conclusions
The small-group health insurance market is complex. From our 1993
survey of firms with fewer than fifty workers, we draw seven conclusions.
(1) Many small employers do offer health insurance (51 percent, on aver-
age). More importantly, the prevalence rises sharply with firm size. A firm
with twenty-five or more workers has a better than eight in ten chance of
providing health insurance to its workers. Corporate status also is related to
whether a small business provides coverage. If a firm is incorporated, the
chances are about six in ten that it provides insurance. (2) The coverage
offered by small employers is similar to that offered by larger employers. The
benefits are relatively broad but are not as deep as benefits in larger firms
tend to be. Lifetime maximum benefits tend to be consistently lower in
small firms. Small firms tend to pay premiums equivalent to those paid by
larger firms but face greater cost sharing.
(3) Managed care has made inroads into the small-group market: Nearly
25 percent of small firms offer such a plan. However, only 2 percent offer a
choice of health plans. To the extent that managed care plans promote
cost- effective use of medical services, they do limit claims costs. Further,
the deductibles in small firms' conventional insurance plans are higher.
This, too, tends to reduce the use of medical services. (4) Firms that do not
offer coverage tend not to do so for three reasons: They fear that they will
have to take benefits away in the future; they perceive health insurance as
not being a high priority; and they perceive health insurance coverage as
presenting significant administrative hassles.
(5) Small firms are price-sensitive with respect to health insurance. A 10
percent reduction in premiums, based upon our survey, should lead to a 10
percent increase in insurance provision. However, given small firms' fear of
having to take back coverage, it is likely that any subsidies would have to be
of long-term duration. (6) Health insurance is widely available to small
firms. They are routinely approached by health insurance agents, and they
often follow up on these solicitations. A majority of small firms have
investigated employer cooperatives, trade associations, or employer coali-
tions as sources of health insurance. However, only 17 percent obtain their
insurance through such a group. (7) There is a significant fear that health-
related eligibility conditions and preexisting conditions will prevent a firm
from changing its insurance plan. However, the actual extent of these
limitations is rather modest. In the small-group market the typical preexist-
ing condition clause is well under one year, and few firms report that
workers or dependents have been denied coverage because of poor health.
Even fewer report that they have been denied group coverage because of
the poor health status of one or more of their workers or dependents.

Some care must be exercised with respect to this and all surveys that
solicit responses to hypothetical questions. What one imagines one would
do and what one actually does may be quite different. Further, small firms

of the local insurance market. Nonetheless, the survey provides insight into
the current state of insurance among small employers.
