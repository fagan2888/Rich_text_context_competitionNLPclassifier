An unprecedented number of women will experience menopause in the next decade. Although the timing of
menopause affects long-term disease risk, little is known about factors that affect this timing. In the present
1995­1997 cross-sectional study, the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, the relation of demographic
and lifestyle factors to age at natural menopause was examined in seven US centers and five racial/ethnic
groups. All characteristics were self-reported by women aged 40­55 years (n = 14,620). Cox proportional
hazards models were used to estimate the probability of menopause by age. Overall, median age at natural
menopause was 51.4 years, after adjustment for smoking, education, marital status, history of heart disease,
parity, race/ethnicity, employment, and prior use of oral contraceptives. Current smoking, lower educational
attainment, being separated/widowed/divorced, nonemployment, and history of heart disease were all
independently associated with earlier natural menopause, while parity, prior use of oral contraceptives, and
Japanese race/ethnicity were associated with later age at natural menopause. This sample is one of the largest
and most diverse ever studied, and comprehensive statistical methods were used to assess factors associated
with age at natural menopause. Thus, this study provides important insights into this determinant of long-term
disease risk in women. Am J Epidemiol 2001;153:865­74.

Over the next decade, approximately 40 million women
will experience menopause (1). Age at the natural final men-
strual period may be an important risk indicator for subse-
quent morbidity and mortality. The risks of cardiovascular
disease (2­4) and osteoporosis (5) tend to be higher for
women with an earlier menopause, but women who experi-
ence an earlier menopause are protected against breast can-
cer (6). One possible explanation for these effects is the
duration of exposure to high circulating estrogen levels,
which could produce distinct outcomes based on the relation
between estrogen and the particular disease.
Age at natural menopause has also been related to all-cause
mortality. In one US population-based study, women who
experienced nonsurgical menopause prior to age 40 years had
a 50 percent higher mortality rate than those reporting
menopause at age 50 years or older (4). Women whose non-
surgical menopause occurred between ages 40 and 50 years
had no increased mortality compared with those whose
menopause occurred at an older age. Another community-
based cohort study reported a 95 percent increase in all-cause
mortality associated with nonsurgical menopause occurring
before age 40 years compared with menopause at age 50 years
or older (2). However, women aged 40­49 years at menopause
were also at a 35 percent higher risk of mortality compared
with women aged 50 years or older at natural menopause.
Several complex causes may underlie the observed relation
between earlier age at menopause and mortality, including
genetic factors, behavioral and environmental exposures, hor-
monal mechanisms, and health-related factors. Understanding
the associations of these factors with age at natural menopause
may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relation
of age at menopause to morbidity and mortality.
Most estimates of age at natural menopause are based on
samples of Caucasian women in western societies, although
one international study of 18,997 women from 11 countries
found the median age at natural menopause to be 50 years
(range, 49­52 years) (7). A few studies of non-Caucasian
women, conducted primarily outside the United States, have
reported younger ages at menopause than those for
Caucasian women. The better-designed studies suggest that
866 Gold et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 153, No. 9, 2001
Africans (8, 9), African Americans (10, 11), and Hispanics
of Mexican descent (12) have an earlier age at menopause
than Caucasian women do, while Japanese (13) and
Malaysian (14) women report a median age at menopause
similar to that for women of European descent.
The most consistent finding regarding behavioral factors
has been that for smokers, menopause occurs 1­2 years ear-
lier than for nonsmokers (10, 15­19). With varying consis-
tency, studies have found that an earlier natural menopause
is also associated with less education (20, 21), low social
class (15, 22), nulliparity or having fewer children (21, 23,
24), never having used oral contraceptives (21, 22, 25), and
low relative weight (18, 26). Being on a weight reduction
diet has also been associated with earlier menopause (10).
Most of these factors may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-
gonadal axis and its regulation of gonadotropins and sex
steroid hormones.
Many prior studies have not had sufficiently large sample
sizes to provide stable estimates of age at menopause (10,
27), did not control statistically for confounding variables,
or used inappropriate statistical techniques. In the present
study, we analyzed data from a large, multicenter study
(Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)) of a
multiracial/multiethnic sample of women to examine the
independent association of a number of factors with age at
natural menopause by using multivariate survival statistical
techniques to adjust simultaneously for the effects of multi-
ple factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study participants
The design and sampling strategy of SWAN have been
described in detail elsewhere (28). Briefly, the study is being
conducted at seven US sites, each of which has recruited a
sample of Caucasian women and women of one racial/
ethnic minority. The study sites are located in Boston,
Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; the Detroit, Michigan,
area; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles, California;
Newark, New Jersey; and the Oakland, California, area.
Five racial/ethnic groups were recruited: African American
(Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh), Caucasian (all sites),
Chinese (Oakland), Hispanic (Newark), and Japanese (Los
Angeles).
A two-stage recruitment process was used. First, during
1995­1997, a cross-sectional survey was conducted, by
telephone at most sites and in person for about half of the
women at two sites (with African Americans as their minor-
ity sample), to assess eligibility for enrollment into a cohort
study and to collect health, reproductive, demographic, and
lifestyle data. Eligibility criteria for the cross-sectional sur-
vey were as follows: age 40­55 years, self-designated as one
of the targeted racial/ethnic groups for the site, residence
near one of the seven clinic sites, speaker of English or one
of the other selected languages (Spanish, Japanese,
Cantonese), and able to give verbal consent. Community-
based sampling from established lists of populations at five
sites and random digit dialing, combined with a "snowball"
approach at two sites (28) (those with the Hispanic and
Japanese minority samples), were used. In the snowball
technique, women first identified by using a list-based or
random-digit-dialing technique were asked for the names
and contact information of other women who met the eligi-
bility criteria; these women in turn were contacted, were
screened for eligibility, and were asked for the names of
other appropriate women. This process continued until a
sufficient number of eligible women was identified. In the
second stage of the study, a longitudinal cohort was
recruited from those women screened and found eligible in
the cross-sectional survey. A total of 16,065 women partici-
pated in the cross-sectional survey, 3,150 of whom enrolled
in the cohort study.
Data collection
Assessment of the outcome (age at menopause).
Natural menopause was defined according to the World
Health Organization (29) as at least 12 consecutive months
of amenorrhea not due to surgery or other obvious cause,
such as extreme weight loss. Women who reported that they
had had a hysterectomy or oophorectomy (unilateral vs.
bilateral was not specified, since in pretests women could
not distinguish between the two) were asked the year of
surgery; age at surgery was computed by subtracting birth
year from the year of surgery. Women not reporting such
surgery were asked whether they had menstruated in the past
12 months. Among those with 12 or more months of amen-
orrhea, women whose periods had not stopped because of
surgery, medical treatment, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or
severe weight loss were defined as naturally post-
menopausal (29). These women were asked in what year
their last menstrual period had occurred; their year of birth
was subtracted from this year to obtain age at menopause.
Menopausal status was defined as surgical amenorrhea if
menses had stopped as a result of hysterectomy and/or
oophorectomy, naturally postmenopausal if menses had
stopped for at least 12 months without surgery, late peri-
menopause if menses had occurred in the past 12 months but
not in the last 3 months, early perimenopause if menses had
occurred in the past 3 months but had become less pre-
dictable, and premenopause if menses had occurred in the
past 3 months with no decreased predictability.
Independent variables. All independent variables of
interest were obtained by self-report during the interview.
Included were demographic factors (age, race/ethnicity, edu-
cational attainment, employment, marital status, number of
children, and ability to pay for basics, i.e., food, shelter, cloth-
ing, and heat), lifestyle factors (smoking, physical activity),
and health-related factors (height and weight (converted to
body mass index (BMI): weight in kilograms/height in
meters2), ever having been told by a health care provider that
she had heart disease, cancer, hypertension, or diabetes).
Primary race/ethnicity was self-defined as Black or
African American, non-Hispanic Caucasian, Chinese or
Chinese American, Japanese or Japanese American, or
Hispanic (Central American, Cuban or Cuban American,
Dominican, Mexican or Mexican American, Puerto Rican,
South American, Spanish, or other Hispanic). Respondents
Correlates of Age at Menopause 867
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 153, No. 9, 2001
could also specify "other," "mixed," or no primary ethnic
affiliation. Since most extant literature regarding age at
menopause is based on non-Hispanic Caucasians, they were
used as the reference group.
Cigarette smoking was categorized as never, former, or
current smoker and number of cigarettes currently smoked
per day, based on modified American Thoracic Society
questions (30). Physical activity was assessed with one
global question about activity level relative to other women
of the respondent's age (31).
Data analyses
Approach. Menstrual status groups were compared with
respect to key demographic, lifestyle, and health character-
istics by using chi-square statistics. We performed bivariate
Kaplan-Meier survival analyses (32) and Cox proportional
hazards regression analyses (33) to evaluate the relation of
categorical and of continuous variables, respectively, to age
at menopause. Variables found in bivariate analyses to be
related (p < 0.15), or suggested by previous literature to be
related, to age at natural menopause were included in the
multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses.
Exclusions. Women whose menstrual periods had
stopped because of medication, radiotherapy, pregnancy or
lactation, or extreme weight change (n  311) were
excluded from the present analyses. Also excluded were
women whose data on current menstrual status (n  109) or
whose information on any covariate (n  1,141) was miss-
ing. Women who identified their primary race/ethnicity as
"mixed" or "other" (n  1,694) constituted a heterogeneous
group whose results could not be interpreted clearly and
were thus excluded. The remaining sample size used in this
analysis was 14,620.
Cox proportional hazards modeling. Cox proportional
hazards models were estimated to assess associations of age
at natural menopause with independent variables. Women
not currently using reproductive hormones who were not
surgically or naturally menopausal were censored at their
current age.
Women who had had a hysterectomy and/or oophorec-
tomy (n  3,069) were censored at their age at surgery,
since surgery masks the age at which a woman would
become menopausal in the absence of this surgery (34).
(We did not have information on whether oophorectomy
was unilateral or bilateral.) We also conducted analyses by
excluding these women; the result was that overall age at
menopause was reduced by 0.4 years and all point esti-
mates changed less than 10 percent (data not shown).
Including these women and censoring them assumes that,
given their covariate information, the distribution of their
"true" age at natural menopause (which cannot be
observed) is the same as that for naturally menopausal
women. Their inclusion is important because they are not
a random subsample of middle-aged women (35­40);
excluding them could lead to biased results. They also con-
stitute a nonnegligible proportion of the population (41,
42), and their data may be informative regarding the tim-
ing of natural menopause.
Women who had used hormones, including oral contra-
ceptives, in the past 3 months ("current users," n  1,151)
were initially considered in two ways, first by excluding
them (10) and then by leaving them in the analysis and cen-
soring at the age computed by subtracting the total number
of years of hormone use from their current age. The results
of these two approaches did not differ, but the latter
approach provided a slightly better model fit; thus, its results
are presented in this paper. Data on women whose
menopause preceded hormone use were included as
menopausal events.
Continuous variables (e.g., parity, BMI) were initially
maintained in multivariable models as continuous variables.
For ease of interpretation, this paper reports hazard ratios by
categories of these variables. For categorical variables, a
conceptually logical referent level was selected for compar-
ison. All other levels of ordinal (e.g., educational level) vari-
ables were coded as dummy variables, rather than assuming
rankings in the models.
Dummy indicator variables for field site were included in
the multivariable models (43). For each of the three
racial/ethnic groups studied at a single site only (Chinese,
Hispanic, and Japanese), the coefficients reflect a direct
comparison with the Caucasians at the same site only.
Interactions between site and race/ethnicity for these three
groups could not be estimated given the study design. Four
sites interviewed African Americans and Caucasians,
enabling us to examine interactions between race/ethnicity
and site for these two racial/ethnic groups, that is, whether
the racial/ethnic difference in age at menopause varied
across these four sites. We also examined interaction terms
for smoking with race/ethnicity, BMI, history of use of oral
contraceptives, parity, education, employment, marital sta-
tus, site, or history of heart disease. Goodness of fit of the
multivariate Cox models was assessed by using the link test
(44, 45).
RESULTS
Unadjusted demographic, lifestyle, and health
characteristics
The majority of women (57.7 percent) were still menstru-
ating. A much greater proportion of African Americans than
all other racial/ethnic groups were surgically amenorrheic,
the highest proportion of women currently using hormones
were Caucasian, and the highest proportions of pre-
menopausal women were among Chinese and Japanese
women (table 1). Higher educational level was associated
with being premenopausal and with current hormone use,
while women with lower educational attainment were more
likely to have surgical amenorrhea. Women who had no dif-
ficulty paying for basics, were employed, were nonsmokers,
or reported being more physically active than other women
of their age were more likely to be premenopausal or to be
using hormones. Women who were single or married (or liv-
ing as married) were more likely to be premenopausal and
less likely to be surgically amenorrheic, while widowed
women were more likely to be post- or surgically meno-
pausal. Women with lower BMI were more likely to be pre-
868 Gold et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 153, No. 9, 2001
menopausal, but women with higher BMI were more likely
to be surgically amenorrheic. Women who had never used
oral contraceptives were more likely than ever users to be
postmenopausal. A greater proportion of women who had
high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease were post- or
surgically menopausal than women without these condi-
tions, although these data were difficult to interpret because
of the cross-sectional design of this portion of the study.
Multivariate associations of risk factors with age at
natural menopause
The overall multiply adjusted median age at natural
menopause was 51.4 years. Current smoking, lower educa-
tional attainment, not being married, not being employed,
and having a history of heart disease were all significantly,
independently associated with earlier natural menopause,
while ever using oral contraceptives, being parous, and
Japanese race/ethnicity were significantly, independently
associated with later age at natural menopause after adjust-
ment for site and each variable for all other important vari-
ables (table 2, figures 1­3). Hispanics had a significantly
earlier menopause than Caucasians did (hazard ratio  1.16,
95 percent confidence interval: 1.01, 1.34) when site was
not included in the multivariate model. The effect of prior
use of oral contraceptives was also examined by duration of
use, and parity was examined by number of children; neither
estimate changed (data not shown).
Initial multivariate Cox proportional hazards models
showed no significant associations, after adjustment for
other variables, of age at menopause with self-reported
physical activity, history of cancer (including breast cancer),

high blood pressure or diabetes, BMI, self-assessed health
status, limitation of activities because of health, or difficulty
paying for basics. Thus, these variables were excluded from
the final multivariate models. Age at menopause did not
increase with duration of prior use of oral contraceptives.
Clinic site was retained in the model, although not signifi-
cantly associated with the outcome. Interaction terms for
smoking with other risk factors were not statistically signif-
icant, nor were interactions between site and African-
American race/ethnicity (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, the overall median age at natural
menopause was found to be 51.4 years after adjustment for
multiple factors, which is comparable to previous reports
in other US studies (10, 19, 21, 27, 34, 46­48). However,
our study demonstrated that Japanese women have a later
natural menopause than Caucasian, African-American,
Hispanic, or Chinese women do. Our results also confirm
those from previous studies showing that current smoking,
lower educational attainment, and nonemployment were
related to earlier age at natural menopause and that prior
use of oral contraceptives and parity were associated with
later age at menopause, as previously reported by some
(49, 50).
Race/ethnicity
Unlike our study, prior studies have reported that age at
menopause for Japanese women was similar to that for
Caucasian women (51, 52). One study of 2,221 Japanese
women reported a median age at menopause of 50.4 years
(13). Another study of 400 Malaysian women reported a
similar median age at menopause of 50.7 years (14).
However, a study of 2,354 Thai women aged 45­59 years,
sampled from Bangkok health centers in lower-middle
socioeconomic status areas, reported a median age at
menopause of 49.5 years (53). Filipino Malay women were
reported to be an average age of 47­48 years at menopause
(54), although the methods used in both of these latter stud-
ies may have biased their results toward lower estimates.

Several studies have reported that Latina women experi-
ence natural menopause about 2 years earlier than
Caucasian women, but we found no difference after adjust-
ment for covariates. For Mexican women, median ages at
menopause have been reported to be 48.2 years (12) and 47
years (22), although the latter study was based on only cur-
rently menopausal women and was thus likely to underesti-
mate median menopausal age. Peruvian and Mayan women,
despite their high parity, have also been reported to experi-
ence menopause earlier, ranging from age 45 to 47 years
(49, 55).
Two previous studies also suggested that African-
American women experience menopause 6­12 months ear-
lier than Caucasians, with a median age of 49.3 years for
African Americans in both studies (10, 11), in contrast to our
study showing no difference between African Americans
and Caucasians, possibly because of the age group of our
sample or greater censoring of African Americans because
of more surgical menopause. Studies in South Africa (8) and
Ghana (9) also reported an earlier age at menopause for
African compared with Caucasian women, but a small
Nigerian study reported the average age at menopause to be
52.8 years (56).
Smoking
The results of the present study add to a growing body of
literature showing that current, but not former, smoking is
associated with earlier age at natural menopause after
adjustment for confounding factors. Women who smoke
stop menstruating 1­2 years earlier than comparable non-
smokers (10, 15, 19, 20, 46­48, 50, 57­59) and may have a
shorter perimenopause (27). Some studies have reported
that heavy smokers have an earlier menopause than light
smokers (15, 18, 60, 61). However, we observed no dose-
response effect of smoking, consistent with at least one
other study (19). Previous studies have shown that former
smokers have no or only a slightly earlier age at menopause
than never smokers (18, 19, 62), suggesting that the effect of
smoking may not be permanent, a finding inconsistent with
a toxic effect leading to atrophy of ovarian follicles.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke are
toxic to ovarian follicles (63, 64) and could result in their
loss and thus in earlier menopause in smokers. Greater
prevalence of hysterectomy among premenopausal smokers
than nonsmokers (60, 65) does not account for the earlier
menopause in smokers (66).
Socioeconomic status
We found that lower educational attainment and nonem-
ployment were significantly, independently associated with
earlier age at menopause, although difficulty paying for
basics was not. Several previous studies indicate that lower
educational attainment and/or socioeconomic status, often
determined by occupational status of the woman or her hus-
band, is associated with earlier age at menopause (15, 20,
21, 50), although the findings are not wholly consistent (10).
Social and physical stress are also associated with amenor-
rhea and reproductive dysfunction (67, 68), and low socio-
economic status or low educational level may be markers
for elevated stress.
Marital status and parity
In our study, separated/divorced/widowed women had an
earlier menopause than women who were married or were
living as married. For parous women, age at natural
menopause occurred significantly later than for nulliparous
women, concurring with the results of most previous work

(10, 15, 21, 23­25, 27, 50, 69). We observed a trend of
increasing age at menopause with increasing number of live-
births, but the trend was not strongly monotonic, unlike that
in some previous reports (24). Since onset of menopause is
theorized to be related to the rate of loss of oocytes and thus
to the occurrence of ovulatory cycles (21, 23, 70), the pro-
posed mechanism by which parity and use of oral contracep-
tives may result in later age at natural menopause is by
reducing ovulatory cycles earlier in life and thus preserving
oocytes longer, resulting in later menopause.
Oral contraceptive use
We found that prior use of oral contraceptives was asso-
ciated with earlier age at natural menopause, although no
relation with increasing duration of use was observed. This

finding is consistent with those of some prior prospective
studies (49, 50) but inconsistent with other results (10, 24)
that either did not use survival analyses or did not control for
the effects of covariates.
Body mass
In the present study, BMI and physical activity were not
related to age at natural menopause. Although some studies
have observed that women with lower BMI had an earlier
natural menopause (18, 26, 69), other work has not con-
firmed this finding (10). In primates and humans, caloric
restriction and nutritional deficiencies are associated with
amenorrhea (71­73). The production of estrone in adipose
tissue, which is greater in more-obese women, may result in
higher levels of circulating estrogens that may contribute to
longer reproductive functioning. Obesity, however, has also
been associated with inadequate ovarian function (74).
Heart disease
We found that women who had heart disease were signif-
icantly younger at natural menopause, consistent with prior
reports showing a protective effect of later age at natural
menopause on heart disease morbidity and mortality (34,
75). However, given the cross-sectional nature of our data,
we are uncertain whether natural menopause preceded a
diagnosis of heart disease. When we did not include this
variable in the multivariate model, none of the findings
changed more than 10 percent. Interestingly, 45 percent of
the women reporting heart disease had had a hysterectomy
and/or oophorectomy, thus resulting in a high proportion of
censored women with this condition. Recent work (76)
shows an estrogen receptor polymorphism to be associated
with earlier menopause and with surgical menopause.
Unlike some (77, 78) but not all (79) studies, age at natural
menopause was not related to diabetes or to hypertension in
our study.
Strengths and limitations
Our use of multivariate survival analyses (which included
and censored women who were still menstruating, had sur-
gical amenorrhea, or were currently using female hormones)
enabled systematic examination of the relation of a number
of independent variables to age at natural menopause.
However, because of the limited time available for the cross-
sectional interview, data were not collected on important
details such as ages at which reproductive hormones were
used and on other potentially important factors such as age
at menarche, age at maternal or sibling menopause, history
of long or short or irregular menstrual cycles, diet (such as
consumption of fat, cholesterol, meat, and phytoestrogens),
and alcohol and caffeine consumption (10, 21, 24, 50, 80,
81). All of these factors will be studied prospectively in the
SWAN cohort, with results available within the next few
years. In addition, in the cross-sectional portion of SWAN,
we had recalled data on only the year of the final menstrual
period and lacked knowledge regarding timing of the factors
examined relative to the final period. Furthermore, we had
information on only the year of the final menstrual period
(surgical or natural); thus, our estimates of age may have
been inaccurate by up to 1 year, either older or younger, a
source of variability that will be reduced in the cohort por-
Correlates of Age at Menopause 873

tion of SWAN. A final limitation is the varied sampling
methods used by the study sites, necessitated by difficulties
in achieving the needed sample size of minority populations,
making use of formal estimation procedures inappropriate.
Thus, the present confidence intervals should be interpreted
with caution.
Nonetheless, the present study is one of the largest, is
comprised of one of the most diverse study populations, and
has been analyzed by using the most comprehensive statis-
tical methods. Thus, the findings regarding the relations
with race/ethnicity, current smoking, parity, use of oral con-
traceptives, educational attainment, and unemployment, and
the lack of association with BMI, are likely to be robust and
suggest that multifactorial host (possibly genetic) and envi-
ronmental factors are involved in a likely complex mecha-
nism to determine onset of menopause.
