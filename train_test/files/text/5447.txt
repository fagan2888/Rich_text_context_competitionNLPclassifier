Introduction
The impacts of access to credit on poor household's con-
sumption and health have been widely studied (e.g., Coleman,
1999; Nguyen, 2008; Pitt & Khandker, 1998; Pitt, Khandker,
Chowdhury, & Millimet, 2003). However, the literature con-
centrates on finding average treatment effects (ATE), which
assumes that all of the treated households get the same impact
from program participation. Studies in other settings show
that treatment effects can vary widely, not only across sub-
groups but also along the distribution of outcomes (Bitler,
Gelbach, & Hoynes, 2006, 2008; Djebbari & Smith, 2008).
This evidence of varying treatment effects is not just an
econometric curiosity; it also accords well with what may
interest policymakers. For example, finding that a credit pro-
gram had much larger impacts for male borrowers would
likely prove influential if policymakers were interested in
closing gender gaps. Hence, a theme in the literature evaluat-
ing impacts of credit is to compare average treatment effects
for sub-groups defined by observable characteristics (e.g.,
age, education, and gender). However, the similarly interest-
ing comparison of whether the impact is the same along the
outcome distribution, such as for households with already
high consumption versus those with low consumption, or
already high health care spending versus the low health care
service spenders, is rarely done. This sort of heterogeneity in
treatment effects can be studied using a quantile treatment
effects (QTE) estimator.
In this article, we report QTE estimates of the impact that
access to credit has on the health care spending of poor
households in peri-urban Vietnam. We used a survey
designed by the authors and applied to a sample of poor
households that are all under the urban poverty line.1 Hence,
in typical approaches to studying heterogeneity in treatment
effects, this sample would be one identifiable sub-group,
who would have an average treatment effect estimated and
assumed to apply to all members of the group. Our estimated
results show that such an approach hides considerable
within-group heterogeneity in the treatment effects.
The remainder of this note is organized as follows. The
next section describes the data collection and estimation
framework. The empirical results are reported in Section 3,
and the final section concludes.

Heterogeneous Credit Impacts on Health
Care Spending of the Poor in Peri-Urban
Areas, Vietnam: Quantile Treatment
Effect Estimation
Tinh Thanh Doan1,2, Gibson John2, and Tuyen Quang Tran1
Abstract
Quantile treatment effects are estimated to study the impacts of household credit access on health spending by poor
households in one District of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. There are significant positive effects of credit on the health budget
shares of households with low health care spending. In contrast, when an average treatment effect is estimated, there is
no discernible impact of credit access on health spending. Hence, typical approaches to studying heterogeneous credit
impacts that only consider between-group differences and not differences over the distribution of outcomes may miss some
heterogeneity of interest to policymakers.

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Because our focus is on micro-
credit impacts on poor households, the sample was selected
from a list of poor households whose initial income per cap-
ita was below the HCMC general poverty line of Vietnam
Dong (VND) 6 million (approximately US$1 per day). The
target sample size was set at 500 households, including 100
reserves, to achieve a realized sample of 400. In fact, 411
households were successfully interviewed, accounting for
26% of the total number of poor households in each of the
selected wards in the district. The interviewed sample pro-
vides 304 borrowing households and 107 non-borrowing
households, with 2,062 members, 955 (46.3%) males and
1,102 (53.7%) females. The sample is likely to be representa-
tive for the poor group whose initial income per capita is
below the poverty line at the survey time in the district but
will not be representative for Ho Chi Minh City nor for
Vietnam.
The survey was designed to collect data on household and
individual demographic­economic variables, commune
characteristics, household durable and fixed assets, child
schooling and education expenditure, health care, food, non-
food, housing expenditure, and borrowing activities. I also
utilized global positioning system (GPS) receivers to collect
data on locations of households and facilities to measure dis-
tances from each household to facilities.
The surveyed areas are located in the most dynamic
region, Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam. The city is the biggest
economic­financial center of the country; it accounted for
only 6.6% of the country's population in 2005 but one third
of its gross domestic product (GDP). The city economy has
recently been growing at above 10% per annum.
The surveyed district is the 5th lowest population density
district and one of the peri-urban districts of HCMC. When it
was established in 1997, the district relied heavily on agri-
cultural production, but its economic structure has changed
drastically due to current fast industrialization and urbaniza-
tion. The average growth rate of industrial production and
services has been very high for the period 1997-2008,
namely, 24.7% and 28.1% per year, respectively. The total
number of enterprises, approximately 400 in 1997, increased
to 1,658 in 2006. In addition, the district population growth
rate is very high; it increased 59% over the period 1997-
2008. Population density within the surveyed district in 2008
is heterogeneous. Some wards are very highly populated, for
example, Phuoc Binh (PB; 18,981 people/km2), Tang Nhon
Phu A (TNPA; 6,546 people/km2), while others are relatively
low, for example, Long Phuoc (LP; 300 people/km2) and
Long Truong (577 people/km2). The main economic activi-
ties of the district are non-farm economic activities such as
industrial production, construction, and services. For our
sample, 72% of household heads are small traders, house-
wives, casual workers, factory workers, and the jobless.
We use a quantile regression (QR) estimator, which exam-
ines the effects of the regressors on the dependent variable at
various points on the conditional distribution of responses
(e.g., at the 25th and 75th percentiles). The model specifies
the th - quantile (0 <  < 1) of conditional distribution of the
dependent variable; given a set of covariates x
i
, and assume
that residual distributions of each quantile are normally dis-
tributed, we have,
Q y X X
  
 
i i i
|
( ) = + × (1)
where y
i
is the outcome of interest (the budget share for
health care in this case) for household i, and x
i
is a set of
explanatory variables including an indicator for credit par-
ticipation and variables measuring the household head's sex,
age, marital status, and education, along with household size,
household expenditure, initial income and assets, and loca-
tion of the dwelling. The treatment variable of interest is
credit participation, which equals one if a household had
received any loans in the 24 months prior to the survey and
zero otherwise. A total of 304 households were borrowers,
and 107 households were non-borrowers under this defini-
tion. The estimator (Equation 1) is the solution to the follow-
ing minimization problem (see Cameron & Trivedi, 2009):

In other words, this is the solution to a problem where the sum
of the weighted absolute value of the residuals is minimized.

For example, y

T
(y)  0.25}, T = 0, 1. The quan-
tile treatment effect at quantile th is defined as 

= y

(T = 1)
- y

(T = 0), and the 

is the difference between the outcome
of interest for the treatment and comparison groups at a par-
ticular th quantile. In other words, the QTE shows how the
treatment effect changes across specified percentiles of the
outcome distribution.
The QTE relies on the rank-invariance assumption, that
the relative value (rank) of the potential outcome for a given
household would be the same under assignment to either
treatment or comparison group (Firpo, 2007). However,
Doan et al. 3
because outcomes for the same household may differ from
one distribution to another based on observable and unob-
servable characteristics, bounds have to be computed for the
QTE (Heckman et al., 1997). Even without rank invariance,
the QTE may still be meaningful as policymakers may be
interested in the marginal distributions of the potential out-
comes. In such cases, QTE is simply the difference between
the same quantile of the marginal distributions of outcomes
for the treated households and for comparison group
households.
Heterogeneity in the outcome variable may correspond
either to variation across particular sub-groups (or cohorts)
in the population that would generate a local average treat-
ment effect (LATE) or to impacts of unobservable character-
istics (Angrist, 2004). In this article, we assume that we have
a homogeneous population, so there are no sub-groups that
would have the LATE (and for whom a particular instrumen-
tal variable might bind while it does not bind for others), and
that the heterogeneity in the outcomes comes from the ran-
dom errors. Because we assume it is unobservables rather
than local treatment effects causing the heterogeneity, we do
not necessarily need an instrumental variable estimator
(which can be combined with the QTE to address bias from
selection on unobservable characteristics (Abadie, Angrist,
& Imbens, 2002)). If good instruments are available, the
QTE with instrumental variables (IQTE) may be more pre-
cise than the conventional IV estimator at the median (Abadie
et al., 2002) in addition to addressing the potential selection
bias. However, in previous results with the same data used
here, no good instruments are identified (Doan, Gibson, &
Holmes, 2014), so we rely on the assumption that the selec-
tion into the treatment is based on observables.
Empirical results
Table 1 presents unconditional differences in monthly aver-
age health care expenditure (in 1,000 Vietnam Dong) and in
the health care budget share. At all points in the distribution
of health care spending considered here, households who
were borrowers spent more on health than their non-borrow-
ing counterparts. The households that borrowed had similar
initial income and assets to the non-borrowers, but higher
current total monthly consumption (appendix). So, one pos-
sible reason for higher health care spending might be that the
same budget share generates more spending for richer house-
holds. However, in fact, that is not the case; the borrowing
households also are devoting larger shares of their budgets to
health at all points in the distribution.
To see whether the higher health care spending of borrow-
ers across the distribution persists when we condition on
explanatory variables, we estimate QTE at the 25th, 50th,
and 75th percentiles (Table 2). The table also presents ordi-
nary least squares (OLS) estimates in the final column of
each panel. The explanatory variables used are listed in the
appendix. Our basic specification includes location, house-
hold size, and expenditure per capita in addition to the credit
participation treatment variable, while an extended specifi-
cation adds the gender, age, marital status, and education of
the household head, and pre-treatment values of income per
capita and assets.2
In both the basic and extended specifications, there is con-
siderable heterogeneity in the treatment effects of credit on
the health care budget share (Table 2). For households with
health budget shares below the median, access to credit is
associated with significantly higher health care spending.

However, for households above the median, health care
spending goes down (insignificantly) when a household is a
borrower. The same pattern is observed when using the
extended model specification. In neither case would these
effects be apparent when using OLS.
Thus, it appears that access to credit increases the health
care budget share of households who had lower health care
budget shares prior to their credit participation. This positive
effect of credit is hidden when estimating an average treat-
ment effect, although the sample is for a homogeneous group
of urban households from one district who are all below the
poverty line.
There also appears to be some heterogeneity in the effect
of per capita household expenditure (used as a proxy for per-
manent income) on the health care budget share. The OLS
estimates suggest that the health care budget share rises by
about three percentage points for every one log point increase
(approximately two standard deviations) in per capita expen-
diture. However, this hides an effect (which is statistically
significant in the extended specification) of the budget shares
falling with higher expenditure at the 25th percentile.
Conclusion and Limitations
Treatment effects can vary widely, not only across sub-groups
but also along the distribution of outcomes. In this note, we pro-
vide an example where our sample is all under the urban
poverty line and would typically be considered one identifiable
sub-group, for which an average treatment effect would be esti-
mated. Yet we find considerable heterogeneity in treatment
effects within this seemingly homogeneous sample, which
would be hidden if we only reported an average treatment effect.
Specifically, although OLS estimates of ATE show no sig-
nificant effect of credit participation on health care budget
shares, the QTE estimates show that credit has positive
impacts on health care budget shares for households with
low levels of health care spending. From a policy point of
view, this suggests that facilitating access to credit sources
may be a significant factor in improving health status of the
urban poor, and the policy may work better if it is better
designed targeting the right families who need the help most.
Land loss (due to urbanization) may be an issue in fast
growing/urbanizing areas in HCMC as well as in other big
cities in Vietnam and where the capital market is less devel-
oped then informal sector has a role to play in which inter-
personal relationship or social capital may affect the access
to credit. It may be appropriate to instrument the credit access
by these factors in an IV model. This limitation opens up a
venue for future study. Furthermore, our study focuses on
peri-urban areas of HCMC, the biggest city. However, the
households in big cities may be different from those in
smaller cities as well as in other regions of the country where
socioeconomic conditions are fairly diversified. As a result,
our results may not be representative of the whole country.
