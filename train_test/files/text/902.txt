Differential Benefits of Volunteering Across
the Life Course

Objectives. Studies often fail to adequately test the causal relationship between volunteering and well-being. Yet the
media and empirical research have focused attention on the impact of volunteering on the well-being of elderly persons.
This study addresses two questions: First, does volunteering improve the psychological and physical well-being of el-
derly persons? Second, do elderly volunteers experience different benefits than younger adults?
Methods. Using nationally representative panel data, I assessed the long-term impact of volunteering on the life sat-
isfaction and perceived health of persons aged 60 and over. I then compared ordinary least squares regression results for
seniors with those for younger adults.
Results. I found that older volunteers experienced greater increases in life satisfaction over time as a result of their
volunteer hours than did younger adult volunteers, especially at high rates of volunteering. Older adults experienced
greater positive changes in their perceived health than did younger adult volunteers.
Discussion. The type of volunteer work in which older and younger adults engage may be part of the reason for these
differential effects. But the context in which older and younger adults volunteer and the meaning of their voluntarism are
more likely explanations. Researchers should take into account volunteer commitment when studying volunteering's ef-
fect on well-being, not simply volunteer role.
HE media are replete with representations of volunteer-
ing as critical to the well-being of the nation as a
whole, and as beneficial to the individual volunteer. Particu-
lar attention has been paid in both the popular press and ac-
ademic outlets to the potential contributions of volunteering
to the well-being of elderly persons. In fact, past research
has suggested that volunteering does improve the physical
and psychological well-being of elderly persons by maintain-
ing self-esteem, life satisfaction, access to support systems,
and activity level (e.g., Bond, 1982; Duncan & Whitney,
1990; Dye, Goodman, Roth, Bley, & Jensen, 1973; Hunter
& Linn, 1980­1981; Moen, Dempster-McClain, & Wil-
liams, 1989, 1992; Musick, Herzog, & House, 1999; Oman,
Thoresen, & McMahon, 1999; Perry, 1983; Young & Glas-
gow 1998). However, although suggestive, there are a
number of ways in which previous studies have failed to
adequately address the question of whether voluntarism in-
creases well-being among elderly persons. Some studies of
volunteering have focused on perceived benefits rather than
actual outcomes (e.g., Hodgkinson, 1995; Hodgkinson &
Weitzman, 1990, 1992); others have used nonrepresentative
samples and/or failed to include a control group of nonvol-
unteers (e.g., Fengler, 1984; Hanks, 1981; Hanks & Eckland,
1978; Young & Glasgow 1998). Still fewer studies have in-
cluded data at more than one time point (but see Moen et
al., 1989, 1992; Musick et al., 1999; Oman, Thoresen, &
McMahon, 1999); therefore, it is not known whether volun-
teering is the cause of improved well-being among seniors or
a consequence of a higher level of well-being to begin with.
As Altergott (1988) has pointed out, gerontological stud-
ies often focus solely on older persons either by limiting the
survey sample to older ages or by choosing older respon-
dents from a broader dataset for secondary analysis. This
has been the case with much of the research on volunteering
and its benefits. This focused attention on volunteering
among elderly persons begs the question of whether volun-
teering among elderly persons is in any way unique in its
benefits. Are the benefits of volunteering to elderly persons
any different from those experienced by younger volunteers?
In this article, I examine the impact of volunteering on
physical and psychological well-being among elderly per-
sons and contrast these benefits with those experienced by
younger volunteers. Drawing from several theoretical per-
spectives, I propose and test alternative hypotheses as to the
magnitude of volunteering's impacts on the well-being of
elderly persons versus younger adults. I address the weak-
nesses of much previous research by using nationally represen-
tative panel data from the Americans' Changing Lives 1986
and 1989 surveys. I conclude by discussing gaps in the current
knowledge about volunteering and, therefore, its effects.
Volunteering and Well-Being Across the Life Course
At any given time, approximately 50% of Americans engage
in volunteer work (Hodgkinson & Weitzman, 1990; Sundeen,
1992). Moreover, 70% of adults report volunteering at some
point in their lifetime (Hodgkinson, 1995). In its broadest con-
ceptualization, volunteer work is generally understood to be
unpaid work on the part of an individual or a group of individu-
als with the intent of benefitting others (Loeser, 1974; Scheier,
1982; Van Til, 1988). Like Tilly and Tilly (1994), I further dis-
tinguish volunteer work as unpaid work on behalf of those with
whom one has no contractual, familial, or friendship obligation.
T
VOLUNTEERING'S BENEFITS ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE S309
Evidence of age differences in volunteering suggests that
participation may be more normative at various points in the
life course. Although voluntary work increases with age
(Curtis, Grabb, & Baer, 1992; Janoski & Wilson, 1995;
Knoke & Thompson, 1977; Umberson, Chan, House, Hop-
kins, & Slaten, 1996), the probability of being engaged in
volunteer work drops off at the older ages, making it most
likely in middle age (Fischer & Schaffer, 1993; Hayghe,
1991; Kim & Hong, 1998). However, elderly persons who
do volunteer invest more hours into their volunteer work
than do younger volunteers (Gallagher, 1994), probably at
least in part because they have more uncommitted time.
In addition to the age differences in time spent volunteer-
ing, elderly volunteers donate their time to different types of
organizations than do younger volunteers. Younger volun-
teers often engage in volunteering as an extension of their
other roles, participating in their local Parents and Teachers
Association, for example (Sundeen, 1990; Wilson & Mu-
sick, 1997). By contrast, a recent study by the Independent
Sector (1998) found that only 22% of elderly volunteers
work with an educational institution. In Sundeen's (1990)
study of predictors of volunteer participation, elderly adults
were also less likely to donate time to a political organiza-
tion than were their younger counterparts. Religious-based
volunteering is an especially popular choice among elderly
persons; 65% donate time to their church or synagogue (In-
dependent Sector, 1998). Younger volunteers are most
likely to focus their efforts on religious organizations when
they are married and have dependent, especially preschool
aged, children (Sundeen, 1990).
Thus, volunteer activity varies across the life course in
terms of who takes on the volunteer role, how much time is
committed, and the types of organizations that benefit from
volunteers' efforts. Most research on the impact of volun-
teering has measured the simple absence or presence of the
volunteer role (e.g., Krause, Herzog, & Baker, 1992; McIn-
tosh & Danigelis, 1995), failing to take into account the fact
that volunteers may be more or less active. The handful of
studies that have considered the impact of volunteer com-
mitment include hours volunteered with the volunteer role
measure in multivariate analyses. These studies have found
no significant association between volunteer hours and
well-being (e.g., Musick et al., 1999). On the other hand,
Rietschlin (1998) and Musick et al., (1999) found that the
range of types of organizations to which a volunteer donates
time is related to well-being. There is no consensus on how
volunteering should be measured in analyses of its relation-
ship with individual well-being.
Most studies have inferred that volunteering improves
well-being, while not testing causal order directly by using
longitudinal data collected from representative community
samples. In only a handful of published studies is the ques-
tion of cause and effect addressed directly. Phyllis Moen
and her colleagues (1989, 1992) found that participation in
voluntary associations has a significant positive effect on
physical health and longevity in their longitudinal analyses
of the impact of multiple role involvement among their
community sample of women. In fact, of all the social roles
they included in their analyses, membership in voluntary as-
sociations has the single largest effect on both physical
health and longevity. However, Moen and colleagues could
not disentangle what kind of activities occur in these organi-
zations; therefore, the impact of membership may not be
representative of the effects of volunteer work. Further-
more, their study did not include men.
Two studies found that volunteering is negatively related
to mortality. Oman and colleagues (1999) reported that el-
der volunteers in a community sample experienced 44%
lower mortality rates over a 5-year period than those who
did not volunteer. This difference was only partially ex-
plained by health habits, physical functioning, religious at-
tendance, and social support. Musick and colleagues (1999)
found that volunteering is negatively associated with mor-
tality among elderly persons in a national sample. Both stud-
ies took into account time spent in volunteer work and the
range of organizations for which individuals volunteered.
However, as they limited their sample to persons over 65,
their results cannot be generalized to younger adults. Fur-
thermore, they focused on only one measure of well-being.
Yet, despite their focused analyses, these studies provided
strong evidence that volunteering does in fact have an im-
pact on physical health. Perhaps if volunteering affects mor-
tality, it also affects physical and psychological well-being.
Theoretical Perspectives and Hypotheses
There are reasons to expect that it would. Beginning with
Durkheim (1951), who emphasized the importance of pri-
mary group ties, sociologists have argued that some posi-
tions in society foster a subjective sense of alienation, or
disconnection with self and society, whereas others promote
a sense of attachment or integration (Mirowsky & Ross,
1986; Seeman, 1959). Seeman (1959) argued that there are
five major types of alienation that lead to psychological dis-
tress: powerlessness, isolation, self-estrangement, meaning-
lessness, and normlessness. In other words, the extent to
which individuals feel they control the outcomes of their
lives, believe they are part of a supportive community, find
their daily work rewarding, have a sense of purpose to their
lives, and expect that rewards can be achieved through so-
cially normative means affects their psychological well-
being. If volunteer work facilitates the development of these
"psychosocial resources" among participants, the volunteer
role should have a positive effect on individual well-being
for both older and younger adults. Furthermore, the more
time one commits to volunteer work, the more access one
should have to these benefits. How the range of volunteer
work performed should relate to its benefits is less clear. On
the one hand, volunteering for a broad range of types of or-
ganizations should expose the volunteer to greater social
networks and reinforce the belief that ends can be achieved
through socially acceptable means. On the other hand, vol-
unteers may feel pulled by their commitments to multiple
organizations and, therefore, less in control of their lives. In
sum, no matter how volunteering is measured it should be
positively related to well-being.
Activity theory.--Activity theory (Gubrium, 1972, 1973;
Herzog & House, 1991) suggests that elderly people who
remain productive and maintain or create new social net-
works do better than do those who disengage from society
S310 VAN WILLIGEN
and social commitments (Erikson, Erikson, & Kivnick,
1986; Hochschild, 1975; Lemon, Bengtson, & Peterson,
1972). There is ample evidence for the activity theory per-
spective in social gerontology (see, e.g., Dorfman, Kohout, &
Heckert, 1985; George, 1990; Kilty & Behling, 1985; Mac-
Lean, 1982; McPherson & Guppy, 1979). Overall, Adel-
mann (1994a, 1994b) found that the number of social roles
senior citizens occupy is negatively related to their level of
depression and positively related to physical health. If the
predictions of activity theory hold, volunteering among el-
derly persons should have a positive effect on psychological
and physical well-being over time. Furthermore, the more
time they commit, the greater the impact of volunteering on
well-being should be. Because the range of commitments is
correlated with time committed (Musick et al., 1999), the
broader the range, the greater the benefits should be.
As the literature review suggests, there are several rea-
sons to expect that elderly adults may experience different
effects as a result of their volunteerism than do younger
adults. First, elderly adults are more active volunteers than
are younger adults. If the predictions of activity theory hold,
therefore, being a volunteer should be more positively asso-
ciated with well-being among elderly persons than among
younger adults because elderly volunteers are more active
than younger volunteers. Second, elderly persons are less
likely to be involved in other activities, such as employment
and child rearing, and therefore their volunteer work may
have a greater effect on their well-being.
Role theory.--However, Herzog, House, and Morgan
(1990) found that it is not only the roles individuals hold but
also the congruity between those role sets and individual
preferences that determine individual well-being. Herzog
and House (1991) went on to argue that it may therefore be
the discretionary nature of the activities, like voluntarism, in
which seniors engage that make their activities particularly
beneficial. As discussed above, younger adults are more
likely to engage in volunteering that is an extension of their
work and child-care responsibilities (Sundeen, 1990; Wil-
son & Musick, 1997)--and therefore may experience vol-
unteering as less discretionary. Although controlling for
family responsibilities and employment should take into ac-
count some of this difference in the contexts in which el-
derly and younger adults volunteer, it cannot account for the
fact that the nature of the activities is different. Whereas
young adults may be more likely to experience the role
strain that results with conflicts between responsibilities
from multiple roles (Goode, 1960; Merton, 1957), this per-
spective argues that even in the absence of conflicts the
meaning of volunteering is different for elderly persons than
for younger adult volunteers. As a result, the effect of the
volunteer role and volunteer commitment on well-being
among elderly persons should be greater than its effect on
younger adults. Range of types of organizations should also
be more strongly associated with well-being among older
adults than among younger adults.
Data
This research used the first two waves of data from the
Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) survey, face-to-face in-
terviews conducted in the home in 1986 and 1989 (House,
1989a, 1989b). Although a three-wave panel analysis would
be preferable, the third wave of the data is not yet publicly
available. The original sample consisted of 3,617 adults
aged 25 years or older. Black people and people over age 60
were sampled at twice the rate of non-Blacks and people un-
der 60. A 21% attrition rate at Time 2 led to a final sample
of 2,867 respondents who were successfully interviewed at
both time points and not missing data on the measures of
well-being, volunteering, or age.
MEASURES
Dependent Variables
In this research, I used two measures of well-being. First,
I assessed the effect of volunteering on life satisfaction, one
of the most commonly measured outcomes in research on
the benefits of volunteering and in research on psychologi-
cal well-being. Second, I measured physical well-being by
using perceived health. Previous studies have shown that
self-reported health is highly correlated with physicians' as-
sessments and with measures of morbidity and mortality
(Idler & Kasl, 1991; Mossey & Shapiro, 1982) and is there-
fore a valid and reliable measure of physical well-being
(Davies & Ware, 1981; Maddox & Douglas, 1973). Al-
though psychological and physical well-being are recipro-
cally related (Gove & Hughes, 1979), they are different
constructs and therefore not perfectly correlated.
Life satisfaction.--Respondents were asked, "Now
please think about your life as a whole. How satisfied are
you with it--are you . . . ?" Response categories ranged
from not at all satisfied (1) to completely satisfied (5).
Perceived health.--Respondents were asked, "How
would you rate your health at the present time?" Responses
were coded from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
Independent Variables
Most studies have examined the impact of the presence or
absence of the volunteer role on well-being. In this study, I
compared and contrasted the presence or absence of the vol-
unteer role with the extent of individuals' involvement in
voluntarism.
Volunteer role.--Respondents were first asked if, in the
past 12 months, they had done any volunteer work for "1) a
church, synagogue or other religious organization; 2) a
school or educational organization; 3) a political group or
labor union; 4) a senior citizen group or related organiza-
tion; and/or 5) any other national or local organization, in-
cluding United Fund, hospitals, and the like." A dummy
variable was created for the volunteer role, coded 1 if the re-
spondent reported performing volunteer work for any orga-
nization and 0 if the respondent performed no volunteer
work.
Volunteer hours.--After having identified the type of
organization for which they had performed volunteer work,
if any, respondents were asked to report the number of
VOLUNTEERING'S BENEFITS ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE S311
hours they spent on volunteer work during the past 12
months. Original response categories included (0) none, (1)
less than 20 hours, (2) 20 to 39 hours, (3) 40 to 79 hours, (4)
80 to 159 hours, and (5) 160 hours or more. Responses were
recoded to the midpoint of each response category. Cate-
gory 5 was recoded to 200 hours (Musick et al., 1999). For
the regression analyses, the measure was centered around the
mean in order to avoid problems of multicollinearity when
testing curvilinear relationships and interaction effects (Aiken
& West, 1991).
Range of volunteering.--Two dummy variables were
computed for range of types of organizations for which the
respondent performed volunteer work in the past 12 months.
One organization was coded 1 if the respondent reported
performing volunteer work for just one organization, 0 if
not. More than one organization was coded 1 if the respon-
dent performed volunteer work for more than one organiza-
tion, 0 if not. Rietschlin (1998) found that the benefits of
participation in increasing numbers of types of organiza-
tions drops off significantly after two.
Age.--Age was coded in years. A recent study by Gen-
dell and Siegel (1996) documented that retirement is begin-
ning younger today than at any other time in the latter half
of this century for both men and women, Blacks and
Whites. The median age at retirement for men and women
in the late 1980s was approximately 63 years, whereas be-
tween 61% and 75% of White and Black men and women in
1993 had received social security retirement benefits by 62­
64 years. Therefore, the sample was stratified into older
adults (age 60 and older) and younger adults (under 60) in
order to compare adults of retirement age with younger
adults who face greater expectations to participate in the la-
bor force. The interval measure of age was also included in
the analyses to control for variations in age within each age
group.
Control Variables
Social roles.--Living as Married was coded 1 for those
who were married or living together with someone as mar-
ried and 0 for those who were not married or cohabiting.
Parent was coded 1 for those with children aged 17 or
younger in the household versus 0 for those with no depen-
dent children in the home. Employed contrasted those em-
ployed full or part time (1) with those who were not em-
ployed (0).
Socioeconomic status.--Education was coded intervally
to represent the highest year of schooling completed and
ranged from 0 to 17. Missing values were coded to the
mean. Family income was the total gross income of the re-
spondent and spouse. Income was originally coded in cate-
gories ranging from (1) less than $5,000 to (10) over $80,000.
I used the imputed income measure calculated by the ACL
staff, which assigns income values to the midpoint of each cat-
egory. Economic strain was a measure of how difficult it was
for respondents and/or their family to meet the monthly pay-
ments on their bills. Response categories ranged from (0)
not difficult at all to (4) extremely difficult. Missing values
were recoded to the mean.
Functional impairment.--Respondents were asked if
they had any difficulties, and if so how much, in performing
a variety of daily tasks, including bathing by themselves,
climbing a few flights of stairs, walking several blocks, and
doing heavy work around the house such as shoveling snow
or washing walls. Response categories included (0) no diffi-
culty, (1) a little, (2) some, (3) a lot, and (4) cannot do. I
used the imputed version of functional impairment com-
puted by the ACL staff, which is an index ranging from 0 to
4, with 4 representing a great deal of functional difficulty.
Social integration.--This was measured in two ways.
To measure informal social integration, respondents were
asked how often they talked with friends and family mem-
bers by phone and how often they visited with friends and
family. Responses included (1) never, (2) less than once a
week, (3) 2­3 times a week, (4) once a day, and (5) more
than once a day. The two questions were averaged. Formal
social integration was measured by the respondent's re-
ported attendance at religious services. Responses included
(1) never, (2) less than once a week, (3) two to three times a
week, (4) once a day, and (5) more than once a day.
Social support.--Respondents were asked, "On the whole,
how much do your friends and relatives make you feel loved
and cared for?" and "How much are these friends and rela-
tives willing to listen when you need to talk about your wor-
ries or problems?" Response categories included (1) a great
deal, (2) quite a bit, (3) some, (4) a little, and (5) not at all.
Responses were reverse-coded, and the two questions were
averaged.
Mastery.--Respondents were asked whether they (1)
strongly agree, (2) somewhat agree, (3) somewhat disagree,
or (4) strongly disagree with each of the following state-
ments: "Sometimes I feel that I am being pushed around in
life" and "There is really no way that I can solve the prob-
lems I have." The two questions were averaged.
Sociodemographic characteristics.--Sex was coded 1
for women and 0 for men. Race was coded 1 for Blacks and
0 for Whites and others. Members of other racial/ethnic
groups made up only 5.8% of the sample; each group made
up no more than 2.2% of the sample.
ANALYTICAL STRATEGY
First, I present descriptive statistics to illustrate differ-
ences between volunteers and nonvolunteers aged 60 and
older and under 60. To test the effects of volunteering on the
well-being of older versus younger adults, I present net ef-
fects models, estimating life satisfaction and perceived
health in 1989, controlling for each measure of well-being
at Time 1. Previous studies have found no significant effect
of volunteer time when time is included in the same model
as the volunteer role. I estimated models with each measure
separately because the vast majority of volunteers commit a
small amount of time to their volunteer work. Therefore,
S312 VAN WILLIGEN
multicollinearity is a potential problem and may explain
previous insignificant findings. Although the sample is
stratified by age, I included the interval measure of age to
control for variations in age within each group. Because or-
dinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses can be prob-
lematic with ordinal-level outcomes (Long, 1997), the re-
sults presented here were replicated by using Stata to
estimate ordered logit models. As the results did not vary, I
present the OLS results here. The significance of differ-
ences in the effects of volunteering across the two age
groups were tested with a t statistic (Jaccard, Turrisi, &
Wan, 1990). To test for the effects of sample attrition on the
observed relationships, I replicated the analyses presented
here by using Heckman's probit-based lambda procedure
(Berk 1983; Heckman 1979), with the hazard of dropping
out of the sample calculated separately for individuals over
the age of 60 and those under 60 (available from me on re-
quest).
RESULTS
Forty-seven percent of the respondents had engaged in
some type of volunteer work during the past year when in-
terviewed in 1986 and 1989. Forty-eight percent of young
adults and 39% of older adults volunteered (see Table 1).
Older adults were, however, more likely to be active volun-
teers. Thirty-one percent of older volunteers reported per-
forming 80 or more volunteer hours in the past 12 months,
in contrast to 24% of younger volunteers. Thirty-four per-
cent of younger volunteers and 29% of older volunteers re-
ported performing fewer than 20 hours of volunteer work
over the course of the year. In 1986, older volunteers per-
formed approximately 72 hours of volunteer work, whereas
younger volunteers donated about 63 hours (p  .05). In
other words, elderly persons worked 45 minutes more per
month on average. The difference was even greater in 1989,
when the average hours for younger adults dropped to ap-
proximately 54 hours, or from 5.25 to 4.5 hours per month.
Although there were no significant differences between
elder volunteers and younger volunteers in range of volun-
teering, there were significant differences in the types of or-
ganizations for which older and younger adults volunteered.
As previous studies have documented, religion-based vol-
unteering was the most common, especially among elderly
persons. Sixty-six percent of older adults participated in
volunteer work at their church or synagogue in contrast to
approximately half of younger adults (p  .001). Seniors
were also more likely to volunteer at senior centers (p 
.001), whereas younger adults were significantly more
likely to volunteer for a school or other educational institu-
tion (p  .001). A large proportion of adults in each age
group stated that they volunteer for another type of organi-
zation, like the United Way.
Tests of the relationships between volunteering and the
control variables confirmed most previous findings. How-
ever, in contrast to some previous studies I found that
Blacks in both age groups were significantly less likely to
volunteer than their non-Black counterparts. In 1986, 32%
of Blacks over age 60 volunteered as compared with 40% of
Whites and others; similarly, 42% of Blacks under age 60
volunteered compared with 49% of non-Blacks (p  .05).
These findings are likely the result of differences in mea-
surement of volunteering; previous studies examining racial
differences have focused on membership in voluntary asso-
ciations that are service oriented but may not engage solely
in volunteer work (e.g., Cohen & Kapsis, 1978; Florin,
Jones, & Wandersman, 1986; Williams, Babchuck, &
Johnson, 1973). In fact, many of the organizations included
in these studies engage in community organizing and politi-
cal activism, which may explain why Blacks in these studies
reported higher levels of involvement. Further research is
needed to clarify the relationship between race and volun-
teer work. As have previous studies (e.g., Curtis et al., 1992;
Janoski & Wilson, 1995; Kim & Hong, 1998; Umberson,
Chen, House, Hopkins, & Slaten, 1996; Sundeen, 1992), I
found mixed results among men and women. Women over
age 60 were no more likely to volunteer than their male
counterparts and reported no greater commitments of volun-
teer time. Conversely, although women under age 60 were
more likely to volunteer (p  .05), men in this age group
contributed significantly more volunteer time when they did
volunteer than their female counterparts (70 hours vs 57
hours, p  .001). All other relationships were consistent
with the findings of previous studies. Volunteers in both age
groups were younger and had fewer functional impairments,
were more likely to be married and to be employed, had
higher levels of education and family income, reported less
economic strain, were more socially integrated with family
and friends, attended religious services more often, and had
higher perceived levels of social support and mastery (see
Table 1). Among young adults, volunteers were more likely
to have children than were nonvolunteers.
The Effect of Volunteering on Elderly Persons
Older adults who did not volunteer reported significantly
worse health than did their volunteering counterparts in
1986 and 1989 (p  .001; see Table 1). Senior volunteers
also reported higher levels of life satisfaction than nonvol-
unteers at both time points, although the difference was only
significant at Time 2 (p  .05). Why did elderly volunteers
experience higher levels of well-being than nonvolunteers?
Was it a result of their volunteer activities, or was it simply
that volunteers have fewer functional impairments, are more
socially integrated, and have higher levels of socioeconomic
status than nonvolunteers, all factors that are positively as-
sociated with well-being? To answer these questions, I used
OLS regression analysis to estimate the net effect of volun-
teering and volunteer commitment in 1986 on life satisfac-
tion and perceived health, respectively, in 1989.
No matter how volunteering was measured, it was posi-
tively associated with life satisfaction and perceived health
among older adults (see Tables 2 and 3). It was not simply
the case that volunteers are the kind of people who are more
satisfied with their lives and healthier in the first place. In
fact, additional analyses tested whether well-being increased
volunteering at Time 2; the results were insignificant (results
available from me), although functional impairment was an
important predictor of volunteer commitment in all the mod-
els. Thus, although physical limitations may restrict volun-
teer activity, physical and psychological well-being do not
predict volunteering.
VOLUNTEERING'S BENEFITS ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE S313
There are some differences in the findings for each mea-
sure of volunteering. The volunteer role is positively associ-
ated with life satisfaction (b  .221, p  .05, Table 2) and
with perceived health (b  .154, p  .001, Table 3). Volun-
teering for more than one type of organization resulted in a
26% greater increase in life satisfaction and a 63% greater
increase in perceived health than the benefits experienced
from volunteering for just one type of organization. The re-
lationship between volunteer hours and satisfaction with life
was positive and significant; satisfaction increased with
level of commitment (b  .002, p  .05, Table 2). How-
ever, the relationship between volunteer commitment and
perceived health was not linear (see Table 3). The physical
benefits of volunteering began to decrease after 100 hours
per year, and if the pattern continues, volunteering would
begin to negatively affect health at 140 hours per year--or
the equivalent of 2.7 hours per week. Because the analysis
controlled for age, it is not the case that this nonlinear effect
is the result of grouping young elderly persons with older
elderly persons, who are more likely to be in failing health.
Although the imprecision of the response categories for vol-
unteer hours in the data did not allow an accurate estimate
of how many seniors in this sample experienced these nega-
tive effects of volunteer work, only 7.5% of seniors donated
160 or more hours in 1986. Thus, for the vast majority of se-
niors, volunteering had positive health implications.
The majority of the volunteer work in which seniors en-
gage occurs in the context of a religious organization, and
attendance at religious services is positively associated with
life satisfaction (Ellison, 1991) and negatively associated
with mortality (Hummer, Rogers, Nam, & Ellison, 1999;
Strawbridge, Cohen, Shema, & Kaplan, 1997). To test whether
the impact of volunteer work was simply a benefit of associ-
ation with a religious group, I included attendance at reli-
gious services in the analyses as a control variable. The im-
pact of the volunteer role on life satisfaction decreased by

only 8% with the inclusion of attendance at religious ser-
vices. Volunteering's impact on perceived health increased
14% with the addition of religious attendance. Like Musick
and colleagues (1999), I found that volunteering is not a
proxy for participation in religious activities.
Chambré (1987) argued that it may simply be physical
activity that makes involvement in social roles important to
the well-being of elderly persons. However, in additional
analyses controlling for how physically active seniors are--
how often they take walks, garden, and/or play sports--
activity level did not explain the impact of the volunteer
role on life satisfaction or perceived health. Activity level
explained less than 2% of the impact of volunteering on sat-
isfaction and on health. Volunteering had benefits beyond
simple physical exertion. In sum, these results provide sup-
port for the first set of expectations. Volunteering does have
positive effects on elderly adults' physical and psychologi-
cal well-being, and the more active volunteers are, the
greater the benefits.
Life Course Comparisons
How does the impact of volunteering on elderly persons
compare with its benefits for younger adults? In comparing
results across the two groups, I used the unstandardized co-
efficients because standardized coefficients are sensitive to
unequal variances between the two groups (Pedhazur,

VOLUNTEERING'S BENEFITS ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE S315
1982). The results of these analyses are graphed in Figures 1
and 2 to allow for comparison. The equations represented in
Tables 2 and 3 were solved at mean levels of the control
variables for each age group.
As the figures illustrate, the analyses for each age group
suggest differences in the benefits of volunteering, and the
results for the two measures of well-being tell very different
stories. Although the volunteer role was more positively as-
sociated with life satisfaction among older adults than their
younger counterparts, it was only marginally so, and the dif-
ference was insignificant (.221 vs .181, p  .60). This sug-
gests that volunteering has the same impact on the life satis-
faction of older and younger adults. However, when the
impacts of range of volunteering and volunteer hours were
compared across the two age groups, the relationship be-
tween volunteering and life satisfaction was revealed to be
quite different across the two groups. Although the differ-
ences in the impact of volunteering for one or more types of
organizations were not significant across the two age groups,
younger adults experienced only a decrease in benefits from
volunteering for more than one type of organization instead
of just one, whereas older adults experienced a 26% in-
crease in benefits. Furthermore, volunteer hours was curvi-
linearly associated with satisfaction among younger adults
and linearly associated with satisfaction among seniors. Al-
though older adults gained additional benefits from increas-
ing levels of commitment, younger adults began to experi-
ence declining returns from their commitment after 100
hours and experienced negative effects from their volunteer
work after 140 hours per year, or 2.7 hours per week.
A comparison of the results for physical well-being also
revealed very different results for the role measure versus
the measure of commitment. The volunteer role's effect on
perceived health was more than 2.5 times greater for elderly
persons than for young adults (.154 vs .055, p  .01). Yet,
as discussed above, the relationship between volunteer
hours and perceived health was curvilinear for seniors,
whereas young adults continued to accrue benefits as their
level of commitment increased. Furthermore, older adults
experienced greater benefits from volunteering for either
one or more than one organization than did younger adults,
although not significantly so, and younger adults who vol-
unteered for more than one organization did not experience
physical benefits from their volunteer work.
Tests of interaction terms between the sociodemographic,
socioeconomic, social role, and social resource variables
suggest only a few, inconsistent differences in the impact of
volunteer work on well-being across members of different
social groups. For example, Blacks under age 60 experi-
enced smaller improvements in perceived health for every
hour of volunteer work they performed than did non-Blacks
(b  .002, p  .05). Race does not mediate the impact of
the volunteer role or volunteer hours on perceived health for
older adults or on life satisfaction for either age group. Vol-
unteers under age 60 experiencing economic strain experi-
enced fewer benefits in terms of life satisfaction for their vol-
unteer hours than did those with less economic strain (b 
.001, p  .05). The volunteer role has less of an impact on
the life satisfaction of young adults with functional impair-
ments than of those without (b  .240, p  .10). Younger

volunteers with high levels of social integration experienced
greater increases in their perceived health than those who
spent less time with family and friends (b  .137, p  .01).
Finally, the results of interactions indicate that younger adults
do not experience role strain as a result of combining volun-
teering with being married, parenting children, or working
outside the home. However, older adults who combined vol-
unteering with marriage reported higher levels of perceived
health than those who were not married or did not volunteer
(b  .352, p  .01), and older adults who worked outside
the home reported higher life satisfaction when they volun-
teer than did those who do not (b  .524, p  .05). Younger
adults did not experience these benefits from combining
roles.
DISCUSSION
This study addressed two primary questions. First, does
volunteer work improve the psychological and physical
well-being of elderly persons? Second, do elderly volun-
teers experience different benefits from their efforts than do
their younger counterparts? These analyses confirm the
long-term impact of volunteer work on the well-being of
elderly persons, using a representative sample of partici-
pants and non-participants and relying on actual versus ex-
pected outcomes.
Much of the research on the benefits of voluntarism has
focused on elderly volunteers. In this study, I also compared
and contrasted the benefits experienced by older versus
younger adult volunteers. My results suggest that the atten-
tion to senior volunteers has been warranted, not only be-
cause seniors are less likely to have other social roles to
keep them active, socially integrated, and feeling productive,
but because they experience the greatest benefits. Further-
more, these greater benefits are not simply because seniors are
more active volunteers; older volunteers experience greater
psychological benefits for each hour that they contribute than
do younger volunteers. And older volunteers experience
somewhat greater benefits for becoming active with multiple
types of organizations than do younger adults. The different
relationships between volunteer commitment and the two
measures of well-being across the two age groups suggest
that different mechanisms may mediate the impact of volun-
teer work at high levels of commitment for each group.
Young adults who are heavily committed may be particu-
larly likely to have high levels of responsibility, including
supervising other volunteers, which may lead to stress,
whereas particularly high levels of volunteer commitment
may be physically taxing for some senior adults. However,
these questions cannot be addressed with these data.
Why older adults experience different benefits from their
activity than do younger volunteers may be in part related to
the types of activities in which they are involved. Unfortu-
nately, the hours individuals reported volunteering were not
differentiated by type of organization for which they volun-
teered their time; therefore, these data cannot be used to
fully investigate the role of patterns of volunteer activities
in the age differential in benefits. However, in additional
analyses not shown, multivariate analyses were conducted
for the total sample, replacing the volunteer role with indi-
vidual dummy variables for participation in volunteer work

for each of the five types of organizations. As 46% of vol-
unteers offered their services to more than one type of orga-
nization, each of these dummy variables had to be entered
individually to avoid problems of multicollinearity. Consis-
tent with the finding that older volunteers benefit more, the
most psychologically beneficial type of volunteer work,
church-based voluntarism (b  .135, p  .05), was most
common among older volunteers. Yet, the evidence is
mixed. Younger adults were more likely to volunteer in
schools, the second most beneficial activity in terms of life
satisfaction (b  .108, p  .05), than were older adults. Se-
nior center voluntarism was the most physically beneficial
and the second most common type of voluntarism among
older adults (b  .117, p  .05). It is followed by volunteer-
ing for a political organization and volunteering in a school
(b  .092 and .068, respectively, p  .05). Thus, volunteer-
ing for different types of organizations yields varying bene-
fits, and elder volunteers are more likely to volunteer for
those types of organizations that have the greatest impact on
well-being.
Another interpretation of the greater benefits experienced
by older adult volunteers comes from a life course perspec-
tive. The roles that individuals take on have different mean-
ings and occur in different contexts at various points in the
life course. Volunteering in old age may be a welcome alter-
native to hours spent at home, whereas volunteering in mid-
dle age often happens as an off-shoot of other roles and,
therefore, may be perceived of as yet another obligatory
task to fulfill in order to be a good parent, worker, and so
forth. Furthermore, the vast majority of adults over 60 be-
lieve that older people should contribute to society through
community service after they have stopped working (Her-
zog & House, 1991). Recent research by Robin Simon
(1997) has suggested that the meanings individuals attach to
particular role identities may mediate the effect of these
roles on their psychological well-being. Further research is
needed to test this explanation for the differential benefits
experienced across the life course. However, these analyses
suggest that efforts to encourage senior citizens to volunteer
and to make volunteering more possible for elderly persons
should continue.
More detailed nationally representative data are needed to
explore how volunteers commit their time, what their volun-
teering means to them, what kinds of activities they engage in
when they do volunteer, and, therefore, what explains differ-
ential impacts on well-being. Furthermore, researchers should
be cautious when choosing a measure of volunteering. Past re-
search has erroneously concluded that volunteer commit-
ment does not significantly affect the impact of the volun-
teer role because including commitment in the same models
as the volunteer role leads to multicollinearity. Yet most
theoretical arguments suggest that time spent in volunteer
work should affect its benefits. As these analyses indicate,
choice of measurement can greatly affect the results and
conclusions drawn.
