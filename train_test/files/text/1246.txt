Population-based allele frequencies and genotype prevalence are important for measuring the contribution of
genetic variation to human disease susceptibility, progression, and outcomes. Population-based prevalence es-
timates also provide the basis for epidemiologic studies of gene­disease associations, for estimating population
attributable risk, and for informing health policy and clinical and public health practice. However, such prevalence
estimates for genotypes important to public health remain undetermined for the major racial and ethnic groups in
the US population. DNA was collected from 7,159 participants aged 12 years or older in Phase 2 (1991­1994) of
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Certain age and minority groups were
oversampled in this weighted, population-based US survey. Estimates of allele frequency and genotype preva-
lence for 90 variants in 50 genes chosen for their potential public health significance were calculated by age, sex,
and race/ethnicity among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. These nationally
representative data on allele frequency and genotype prevalence provide a valuable resource for future epidemi-
ologic studies in public health in the United States.

Completion of the human genome sequence (1­3) and
recent advances in the analysis of genome-wide associations
for several common diseases (4­20) are generating tremen-
dous opportunities for epidemiologic studies to evaluate the
role of genetic variants in the etiology of common human
diseases. Identification of allelic variants has accelerated as
a result of the cataloging and mapping of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genome by the In-
ternational HapMap Project (21­23) and characterization of
the scope of structural variation, including copy number var-
iants, in the genome (24­27). Application of these advances
to improve public health requires assessing the frequency of
these variants in distinct populations, identifying diseases
influenced by these variants, determining the magnitude of
the associated risks, and elucidating gene­gene and gene­
environment interactions. Although the number of published
investigations in these areas of human genome epidemiology
has increased rapidly, with publication of more than 6,000
reports yearly (28), methodological issues have made it dif-
ficult to integrate the evidence and, thus, to easily translate
the findings into public health improvements (29­31).
Early studies of genotype prevalence used samples that
were convenient to obtain, and minimal information was
provided on the selection of participants (31). In addition,

most estimates were calculated from data on small study
populations, which limited the accuracy of estimates of allele
frequency and genotype prevalence. Furthermore, frequencies
for most genetic polymorphisms have been measured only in
select US racial and ethnic groups and have not been presented
by age group or by sex. Although select polymorphism fre-
quencies have been reported in large populations (32, 33),
these studies were community based or controls from larger
case-control studies. In contrast, data on genetic variants can
be obtained from large, well-designed, epidemiologically
well-characterized, and population-based US surveys such as
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) (34, 35). These data are a unique and unpar-
alleled resource for epidemiologic research to assess genetic
variation in the population, gene­disease associations, inter-
actions between gene­gene and gene­environment factors,
and population-attributable risk for genetic variants.
In particular, NHANES III offers the opportunity to assess
genetic variation among major racial and ethnic groups in the
United States, for whom multiple health disparities exist
(36­40). Health disparities result from the complex interac-
tions of social, environmental, behavioral, and genetic in-
fluences in a diverse population (36, 41, 42). Public health
strategies to address health disparities are more likely to be
effective when they are based on sound integration of such
risk information at the population level. NHANES III is
a paradigm for complex analysis of unbiased, population-
based data on social, environmental, behavioral, and biologic
characteristics--including genetic variation--in relation to
health status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Survey design
NHANES III is a complex, multistage sample survey
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
(35, 43), during 1988­1994. This cross-sectional study was
designed to provide national statistics on the health and
nutritional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-
lation in the United States aged 2 months or older. Certain
populations, including young children, older adults, non-
Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, were over-
sampled (35). As with standard NHANES analyses, race/
ethnic groups were defined on the basis of the combination
of the reported race (black, white, other) and reported eth-
nicity (not Hispanic, Mexican American, other Hispanic) of
survey participants (35). Detailed household interviews
were conducted to obtain information on sociodemographic
variables, medical history, health-related behaviors, and use
of medications. As part of the survey, physical examinations
and laboratory and radiologic measurements were per-
formed in special mobile examination centers (35).
NHANES III DNA bank
During Phase 2 of NHANES III (1991­1994), 10,052
participants aged 12 years or older were examined in the
mobile examination centers. As part of the examination
consent, participants agreed that their blood could be kept
for long-term storage and future research, although genetic
research was not mentioned specifically. In August 2001,
the CDC/NCHS Ethics Review Board approved a revised
plan for use of these specimens according to guidelines in
the August 1999 National Bioethics Advisory Commission
report on the use of stored biologic materials for research.
This revised plan allows linkage of the genetic laboratory
results to NHANES data through the NCHS Research Data
Center to ensure that confidentiality of the study partici-
pants' identities is maintained (44). Attempts were made
to establish Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell lines (35,
44) from white blood cells obtained from 8,200 of the Phase
2 participants. However, the final NHANES III DNA bank
contains 7,159 participants because of the inability to trans-
form and grow a successful immortalized cell line
(n ¼ 1,004), concerns regarding laboratory practice and
quality assurance (n ¼ 21), and exclusion of 16 individuals
who were not genotyped. The bank is jointly maintained by
both NCHS and the National Center for Environmental
Health at CDC. Demographic characteristics of participants
in the DNA bank are included in Table 1. Sixty-two percent
of participants were from households with multiple family
members (average, 1.59 members per household; range,
1­11). This prevalence study was approved by the NCHS
Ethics Review Board.
Selection of candidate genes and variants
Members from a multidisciplinary working group
reviewed available phenotype data from NHANES III,
performed systematic literature reviews, and identified
candidate genes and physiologic pathways thought to be
associated with diseases of public health significance at
the time of project initiation. The selection of polymor-
phisms for this study was also based upon input from the
SNP500Cancer resource (45), which had already developed
genotyping assays for numerous SNPs in the selected genes
based on their potential importance to physiologic pro-
cesses, epidemiologic studies, and health outcomes.
The selected variants are in genes that encode proteins in
6 major cellular and physiologic pathways: 1) nutrient me-
tabolism (e.g., homocysteine, lipids, glucose, and alcohol);
2) immune and inflammatory responses; 3) xenobiotic me-
tabolism (e.g., of drugs, carcinogens, or environmental con-
taminants); 4) DNA repair; 5) hemostasis and the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system; and 6) oxidative stress.
The variants are in pathways affecting the development of
multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabe-
tes, cancer, and infectious diseases, as well as modulation of
the effects of environmental and occupational exposures.
Genotyping methods
DNA analysis for the project was performed at two facil-
ities because neither lab had methodology developed to an-
alyze all of the genetic variants: 1) the Core Genotyping
Facility, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, Maryland (http://cgf.nci.nih.gov), and
2) the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for
Environmental Health, CDC, Atlanta, Georgia. Each lab

analyzed all DNA specimens for each subset of genotyping
assays performed.
Most polymorphisms were assayed by either the TaqMan
assay (5# nuclease assay; Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
California) or the MGB Eclipse assay (3# hybridization-
triggered fluorescence reaction; Nanogen (formerly Epoch
Biosciences), Bothell, Washington). Two polymorphisms were
genotyped by pyrosequencing, and one was by capillary frag-
ment analysis. Water controls and DNA samples with known
genotypes, purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Cam-
den, New Jersey), were included on each 384-well plate. De-
tailed genotyping methods, including primer and probe
sequences, are described in Web Appendix 1 and Web Table 1,
respectively.(ThisinformationisdescribedinWeb-onlymaterial

each is preceded by ``Web'' in the text. All are posted on the
Journal's website (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).)
Quality control
The NHANES III genotyping data were monitored by
a quality assurance and quality control committee composed
of experts in laboratory science at CDC and NCI. The group
monitored results of NHANES III quality control genotyp-
ing to ensure that the data met quality control guidelines
established by NCHS.
Initial quality assurance assessments determined that at
least 7,128 specimens, depending on the laboratory, were
suitable for genotyping analysis on the basis of sample qual-
ity. All polymorphisms with genotyping call rates below
95% completion did not meet quality control criteria and
were removed from further analyses. NHANES provides
480 quality control specimens for all studies that use the
NHANES III DNA bank samples. These include blind rep-
licates of approximately 6% of the 7,159 samples, to de-
termine the accuracy and reproducibility of the assays.
Assays that passed the blind-replicate analyses (>98% con-
cordance according to NCHS guidelines) were tested for
deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions calculated sep-
arately for each race/ethnic group in a standard unweighted
analysis (46). The threshold for a genetic variant to pass
Hardy-Weinberg analysis was P ! 0.01 (2 sided) for at least
2 of the 3 main race/ethnic groups (i.e., non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American), with use of
a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. The race/ethnicity cate-
gory ``other'' was not used in determining the deviation
from Hardy-Weinberg proportions because of the genetic
heterogeneity of this group. Data from 192 samples were
removed from certain assays because of a sample handling
issue discovered in one of the laboratories. Genetic variants
that met all quality control guidelines were used for further
analyses. The range of successful genotype identifications
for these variants was 97.5%­99.9% (median, 99.2%).
Results from the tests of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
proportions for these variants are listed in Web Appendix 2.
Overall, 90 variants in 50 genes were available for esti-
mation of allele frequency and genotype prevalence. Nearly
all (n ¼ 87) of the variants genotyped are SNPs, and 3 are
insertion/deletions. Various diseases or conditions for which
these genes have a confirmed or purported association are

but it demonstrates that the genes studied are involved in
major pathways that have a role in the etiology of several
diseases or conditions with public health significance.
Statistical analysis
Sample weights. Because NHANES III is a multistage,
complex sample survey, all statistical analyses must account
for sample weights and the survey design to produce unbiased
national estimates and appropriate standard errors. The vari-
ance in clustered data caused by households with multiple
related study participants was accounted for by use of the
appropriate sample weights and the survey design in SUDAAN
software (SUDAAN Statistical Software Center, Research
Triangle Park, North Carolina). Point estimates and variances
were calculated by using sample weights recalculated (47) for
the Genetic Component of NHANES III. These weights were
derived from the appropriate NHANES III, Phase 2, mobile
examination center (MEC) sample weights to adjust for par-
ticipant refusal to consent to future research and from the in-
ability to generate cell lines and obtain DNA as mentioned
above. NHANES genetic weights are specifically estimated
for the genetic component of the 7,159 DNA bank participants,
and none of the other weights provided by NHANES is appro-
priate. More detailed information about statistical weights in
NHANES III is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
about/major/nhanes/nh3data_genetic.htm).
Prevalence estimation. Analyses were conducted by us-
ing SAS-callable SUDAAN, version 9.01, and SAS, version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). Deviations
from Hardy-Weinberg proportions were tested with a chi-
square goodness-of-fit approach by using SAS/Genetics
(SAS Institute, Inc.). Allele frequency and genotype preva-
lence were calculated in SUDAAN and weighted by using
the NHANES III Genetic Component sample weights for
each gene variant for all major race/ethnic groups (i.e., non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
and other) (data for ``other'' are not shown), age groups,
and sexes. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals
were calculated and weighted for each race/ethnic group
in SUDAAN to obtain the nationally representative esti-
mates for the US population. The Taylor series linearization
approach (48, 49), which derives a linear approximation of
variance estimates to develop corrected standard errors and
confidence intervals, was implemented to estimate variances.
Tests of the difference in allele frequencies among race/ethnic
groups (``other'' was excluded), age groups, and sexes were
performed by using polytomous logistic regression. Tests of
the differences in genotype prevalence among these groups
were evaluated using the Wald chi-square method. Statistical
significance was considered as P < 0.05. The differences in
allele frequency and genotype prevalence by age and by sex
were examined after adjustment for race/ethnicity by using the
Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test at a significance level of 0.05.
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics of the 7,159 participants in
the NHANES III DNA bank are described in Table 1. After
adjustment for the NHANES III sample design and for non-
response in the genetic component, there were slightly more
women than men in the US population between 1991 and
1994. The weighted frequency for each of the 3 main race/
ethnic groups was 73.5% non-Hispanic white, 11.7% non-
Hispanic black, and 5.7% Mexican American. The highest
weighted frequency of persons aged 60 or more years and
the lowest weighted frequency of persons aged 12­19 years
were observed in non-Hispanic whites.
Weighted allele frequency point estimates for the 90 ge-
netic variants for each of the 3 major race/ethnic subgroups
in the US population are shown in Table 2. Complete fre-
quency estimates with confidence intervals are shown in
Web Figure 1 and Web Appendix 4. Allele frequencies were
significantly different across race/ethnic groups for 88
(97.8%) of the variants studied (P < 0.05, two tailed), ex-
cept for rs4986893 (CYP2C19, no homozygotes for minor
allele) and rs1801274 (FCGR2A). Summary allele frequen-
cies among the three major race/ethnic groups are shown in
Table 3. Of the 90 candidate gene variants, 80 (88.9%)
among non-Hispanic whites, 79 (87.8%) among non-
Hispanic blacks, and 80 (88.9%) among Mexican Americans
had allele frequencies of 0.02 or greater.
Differences in minor allele frequency of more than 20%
(absolute value) compared with non-Hispanic whites are
22.4% (22 of 90 polymorphisms) for non-Hispanic blacks
and 7.8% (2 of 90) for Mexican Americans (data not
shown). Comparisons between NHANES III allele fre-
quency estimates and other publicly available data sources
are shown in Figure 1, with variants in MTHFR and VDR as
examples. As observed, the NHANES III study includes
much larger sample sizes, resulting in frequency estimates
with small confidence intervals.
Significant differences in genotype prevalence across
race/ethnic groups were seen for all variants except three:
rs4986893 (CYP2C19), rs1801274 (FCGR2A), and
rs2066470 (MTHFR) (Web Appendix 4). Deviations from
Hardy-Weinberg proportions were seen for 4 of the 90 poly-
morphisms (4.4%) among non-Hispanic whites, 1 (1.1%)
among non-Hispanic blacks, and 5 (5.6%) among Mexican
Americans (P < 0.01) (Web Appendix 2).
Weighted allele and genotype frequencies did not differ
significantly by age group in the US population for the ma-
jority of the polymorphisms. However, 16 variants (17.8%)
differed significantly in allele frequency, and 21 (23.3%) dif-
fered significantly in genotype prevalence by age (data not
shown). After adjustment for race/ethnicity, these numbers
decreased dramatically to 5 (5.6%) polymorphisms for allele
frequency (Web Appendix 5) and to 14 (15.6%) variants for
genotype prevalence (Web Appendix 6). However, we found
that some of the race/ethnicity-adjusted tests may not be
reliable because of zero cell counts.
There were no significant differences in allele frequencies
or genotype prevalence by sex, except for rs1800451
(MBL2) and rs1800482 (NOS2A) (data not shown). After
adjustment for race/ethnicity, the allele frequencies of
3 variants were statistically significant by sex-- rs2243248
(IL4), rs1800482 (NOS2A), and rs361525 (TNF) (Web
Appendix 7). After adjustment for race/ethnicity, the geno-
type prevalence of two variants was significantly different

DISCUSSION
Our study evaluated the allele frequency and genotype
prevalence of polymorphisms that have known or proposed
associations with common diseases in a large, minority-
enriched, and nationally representative sample of the US pop-
ulation. This is the first relatively large-scale, population-based
effort in the United States to obtain such data by race/ethnic
group. These data and future planned analyses will serve as an
important reference for investigations into US population
structure, for examinations of gene­disease associations in
other investigations of the NHANES data set, for calculation
of attributable risk, and for use as a reference by researchers
in the design of further studies to discover associations of
alleles and genotypes with common diseases.
Estimates of allele frequency and genotype prevalence
are available from a number of existing gene variant data-
bases, including the International HapMap Project (21­23)
(http://www.hapmap.org) and the SNP500Cancer Database
(45) (http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov). However, compari-
sons between NHANES III and such databases are limited
because of significant differences in inclusion criteria, study
populations, and classification of racial and ethnic groups
between NHANES III and the other studies. Especially im-
portant is that these public databases function as genomic
discovery tools. Consequently, their study populations were
drawn largely from a small number of non-population-based
samples. These small numbers of participants preclude ac-
curate estimation of allele frequency and genotype preva-
lence, especially for rare variants or those that vary
significantly by race and ethnicity. We compared two variants
in MTHFR and VDR with other data resources and found
substantial differences in allele frequencies (Figure 1).
SNP500Cancer reports the C allele frequency of rs731236
(VDR) as 48.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 35.3, 61.3)
in non-Hispanic whites and as 35.4% (95% CI: 21.4, 49.4)
in the African-American population. However, NHANES III
estimates are 38.1% (95% CI: 36.0, 40.3) and 28.2% (95%
CI: 26.8, 29.6), respectively. In conclusion, the NHANES III
estimates of allele frequency and genotype prevalence in the
US population are more representative and stable than are
those calculated from previously available data.
In this study, allele frequency (in 88 of 90 genetic var-
iants) and genotype prevalence (in 87 of 90 variants) dif-
fered significantly by race/ethnic group. Non-Hispanic
blacks had considerable differences in minor allele fre-
quency compared with non-Hispanic whites, with almost
one-quarter of variants differing by at least 20% (absolute
difference). In contrast, less than 10% of variants differed
by at least 20% in allele frequency between Mexican Amer-
icans and non-Hispanic whites. Differences in allele and
genotype frequency could partially contribute to differences
in disease occurrence between population subgroups. As an

Genetic Variant Prevalence in NHANES III 61

example, the Pro12Ala variant of PPARG (rs1801282) has
been studied extensively in relation to type 2 diabetes, with
the Pro allele (C) being associated with increased disease
prevalence (50). This finding has been duplicated in some
genome-wide association studies (13­15), although not
in all populations (51, 52). The higher CC genotype
prevalence in non-Hispanic blacks (95.0%) compared with
non-Hispanic whites (75.8%) may be a strong contributing
factor to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes among non-
Hispanic blacks, as this PPARG variant has been estimated to
have a large population attributable risk of ~25% (50). Be-
cause differences in the occurrence of common human dis-
eases among populations reflect variation in genetic factors,
environmental factors, and their interaction, population-
based genotype data, when coupled with other disease risk
factors, will give us better insight into the causes of popula-
tion differences in the occurrence of various diseases.
On the other hand, allele frequency and genotype preva-
lence did not differ significantly between men and women
for most of the genetic variants studied (!97.8%). Similar
findings on allele frequency or genotype prevalence by sex
have also been reported in some large studies (32, 33).
Although we report statistically significant differences by
age for approximately one-fifth of the genetic variants stud-
ied, most of these differences were no longer present after
adjustment for race/ethnicity. This finding is likely attribut-
able to the differences in age distribution between the race/
ethnic groups (Table 1). Some of the significant differences
in allele frequencies by age may indicate survival advan-
tage, and other studies have found variants in or near
MTHFR (53, 54), PON1 (55, 56), TLR4 (55, 57), and TNF
(58) associated with aging or longevity. However, few genes
have been reproducibly shown to do so (59, 60), and our
results could be due to insufficient sample sizes or due to
statistical chance in analyses.
There has been a concern that multiple individuals from
a household were included (average household, 1.59 indi-
viduals; range, 1­11) in NHANES III for the estimation of
allele and genotype frequencies. However, the estimates
were calculated by using methods specifically designed to
analyze data from surveys with complex designs. These
methods adopt NHANES III sample weights and adjust
the variance of the estimate among the correlated observa-
tions. NHANES III is a population-based survey that reflects
the actual and overall genetic structure of the general US
population, which contains many related individuals within
or between subpopulations. Thus, inclusion of related indi-
viduals in the NHANES III survey should enhance the gen-
eralizability of estimates derived from these data.

Some potential limitations of this study are notable. First,
NHANES III categorizes race and ethnicity according to
self-reported affiliation, as do most epidemiologic studies.
There is considerable literature on the accuracy of this social
measure as a proxy for genetic ancestry (61­65). Despite the
possible misclassification or oversimplification of genetic
ancestry, these data may help to elucidate the uncertain
contribution of genetic variation (65, 66) to the complex
interactions among social, environmental, and behavioral
influences in a diverse population that contribute to racial
and ethnic health disparities. Another concern is that homo-
zygotes were not detected for some rare polymorphisms in
this study, and thus the statistical tests for these genetic
variants may not be reliable. In addition, future studies of
gene­disease associations and gene­environment interac-
tions with rare variants may be limited by insufficient sam-
ple sizes when analyses are performed separately for each
race/ethnic group and control for large numbers of variables.
In the near future, we plan to use race and ethnicity, as
well as geographic information, to conduct a focused exam-
ination of the genetic substructure of the US population and
subpopulations. This issue is generating increased interest,
because latent population substructure has been discovered
in populations previously thought to be relatively homoge-
neous (67, 68). Such analyses are, therefore, especially im-
portant for the heterogeneous US population and
considering the high levels of admixture within African-
American and Mexican-American populations (69­72).
Multiple studies demonstrate that population substructure
must be taken into account in the design and interpretation
of genetic association studies (67, 68, 70, 73­75). Further
research on population characteristics and genetic diversity
will be invaluable in conducting genetic epidemiologic stud-
ies in the United States.
Determination of the prevalence of genetic polymor-
phisms associated with common diseases of public health
importance in the US population and in subgroups of the
population is a critical first step in evaluating the genetic
epidemiology of complex diseases. These prevalence esti-
mates can be used in predicting sample size requirements
for future epidemiologic studies to evaluate genetic deter-
minants of susceptibility to chronic and infectious diseases,
the severity of disease, and interactions with other risk fac-
tors. Because data on genotype frequency are particularly
sparse for non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans, our
estimates are useful in sample size calculations for studying
the genomic contribution to the health of these populations.
Investigations currently underway examine the associations
of the reported genetic variants with select nutritional, bio-
chemical, and clinical characteristics in the NHANES III
data set that serve as markers or risk factors for numerous
health outcomes. These outcomes include asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular dis-
ease, viral infections, and osteoporosis.
With the recent successes of genome-wide association
studies, the resource of the NHANES III DNA bank offers
significant opportunities to move beyond investigations of
candidate genes, as was done here. Many recent genome-
wide association studies have uncovered replicable genetic
associations with diseases such as breast (4­6), prostate (7, 9),
and colorectal (8, 10) cancers; heart disease (11, 12); di-
abetes (13­17); and obesity (18­20). However, many of
these large-scale, case-control studies did not use represen-
tative samples of the underlying populations from which the
cases were derived. NHANES is the only nationally repre-
sentative, population-based sample survey that systemati-
cally collects physical, physiologic, imaging, laboratory,
and interview data on a large number of individuals in the
United States. Use of a whole-genome approach to assess
the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms, including copy
number variants, in the NHANES III DNA bank will be
an important next step toward identifying genetic variants
that can help to predict disease susceptibility and progres-
sion. This approach will also provide the basis for estimat-
ing the numbers of people in the United States who may
benefit from genome-based tools, such as risk factor reduc-
tion; disease screening efforts; or diagnostic tests, drugs, or
other preventive or therapeutic interventions. Current and
future NHANES III prevalence estimates will be deposited
into a publicly accessible database for research.
Thus, this first effort in NHANES begins to lay a strong
scientific foundation for studying the impact of genetic var-
iation on common diseases in the United States and in the
future evaluation of biomarkers and diagnostic tests. Infor-
mation derived from NHANES will provide an important
reference and will enhance the translation of genomic in-
formation into clinical and public health practice.
