Introduction: Despite being associated with multiple dis-
ease processes and cardiovascular outcomes, uric acid (UA) ref-
erence ranges for adolescents are lacking.We sought to describe
the distribution of UA and its relationship to demographic,

clinical, socioeconomic, and dietary factors in US adolescents.
Methods: A nationally representative subsample of 1,912
adolescents 13­18 y of age, from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2005­
2008 representing 19,888,299 adolescents, was used for this
study. Percentiles of the distribution of UA were estimated
using quantile regression. Linear regression models examined
the association of UA with demographic, socioeconomic, and
dietary factors.
Results: The mean UA level was 5.14 ± 1.45mg/dl. It
increased with increasing age and was higher in non-Hispanic
whites, male sex, those with higher BMI z-scores, and those
with higher systolic blood pressure (BP). In fully adjusted linear
regression models, sex, age, race, and BMI were independent
determinants of higher UA.
Discussion: This study defines serum UA reference ranges
for adolescents. It also reveals some intriguing relationships
between UA and demographic and clinical characteristics that
warrant further studies to examine the pathophysiological role
of UA in various disease processes.
In humans and higher primates, uric acid (UA) is the final
oxidation product of purine metabolism and is excreted in
urine. Elevated serum UA levels can result either exogenously
from increased intake of purine-rich foods, or endogenously
from increased production as seen in certain malignancies
and inborn errors of metabolism; elevated serum UA levels
can also result from decreased renal clearance. It is becoming
apparent that UA homeostasis and its relationship with health
and disease is complex. Elevated serum UA is associated with
hypertension (HTN), as well as with diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, endothelial dysfunction, obesity, metabolic syndrome,
nephrolithiasis, intellectual disabilities, and all-cause mortality
(1­8). On the other hand, some recent investigations provide
evidence that UA may be beneficial as an antioxidant/free-

radical scavenger in certain patient groups (9­11).
The association between elevated serum UA and HTN in
both adults and children is well-described (1,12). HTN is one
of the most prevalent diseases in the Western world and track-
ing studies suggest that children and adolescents with elevated
blood pressure (BP) are more likely to be hypertensive adults
and develop metabolic syndrome (13,14). Despite multiple
investigations into the relationship between UA and HTN in
children, little is known about the normal range of serum UA
levels in children and adolescents. Previous studies on UA
levels in children were either based on small sample size or
presented only mean UA values (15­18). Further, given that
previous studies were not representative of the US population,
it is possible that they do not broadly represent recent trends
and changes in diet and demographics.
Similarly, associations between serum UA levels and socio-
economic status, diet, and other demographic, clinical, and
laboratoryparametershavenotbeenestablishedinadolescents.
Therefore, the aims of this study were to (i) examine serum UA
distributions in a large, nationally representative cohort of US
adolescents; (ii) examine the relationships between UA values
and dietary and demographic variables; (iii) examine the rela-
tionships between UA values and BP and other cardiovascular
risk factors; and (iv) examine the determinants of elevated UA
levels in a multivariate regression model.
Results
Relationship Between Serum UA and Demographics
A total of 1,912 adolescents in NHANES 2005­2008, 13­18 y
of age and representing 19,888,299 adolescents, were included
in these analyses (Figure 1). The mean (± SD) UA level was
5.14 ± 1.45mg/dl, and the levels were higher with increas-
ing age and for the male gender as compared with the
female gender. Participants categorized as belonging to the
non-Hispanic white race had significantly higher mean UA

levels (5.22 ± 0.99mg/dl) as compared with non-Hispanic
blacks (4.89 ± 1.98mg/ dl) and Mexican Americans (5.03 ±
2.33mg/dl), P = 0.002 and 0.0164, respectively (Table 1).
The relationships between weighted UA quartiles (estimated
by quantile regression) and demographic and biochemi-
cal characteristics are shown in Table 2. An increase in UA

quartile was significantly associated with older age, higher
BMI, greater height, greater weight, male gender, and black
race, and was inversely associated with higher urinary albu-
min/creatinine ratio (ACR) per weighted least squares analy-
ses. Significantly more non-Hispanic white, male, and older
adolescents with higher BMI z-scores were in the higher UA
quartiles (i.e., higher UA levels). There was no significant trend
in the relationship between UA quartile and either cholesterol
or estimated glomerular filtration rate. The lowest C-reactive
protein levels were observed in the second quartile (UA 4.3­
5.1mg/dl) (1mg/dl = 59.48 µmol/l SI units), but this trend was
not statistically significant (P = 0.365).
Relationship of UA Levels With Diet and With Poverty
The association between the results of the dietary recall
interviews (averaged over 2 d) and UA quartiles is shown in
Table 3. The relationships between dietary data and increas-
ing UA quartile were "J" shaped for all dietary components,
with the exception of fiber. The second quartile of UA (4.3­
5.1mg/dl) was associated with the lowest percentage of pov-
erty (Table 2).
Relationship of UA With BP
A total of 273 participants (15.8 %) had elevated BP, defined as
90th percentile for age, sex, and height. Of these, 50 (2.9%)
had HTN and 223 (12.9%) had pre-HTN. UA levels were not
significantly different between the prehypertensive and the
hypertensive groups. Systolic BP value, and classification as
HTN/pre-HTN were significantly associated with higher UA
quartiles (P = 0.019 and <0.001, respectively, Table 4).
Determinants of UA Levels
In a weighted linear regression model, sex, older age, non-
Hispanic white race, and having a higher BMI z-score were

Serum uric acid in US adolescents
significantly associated with higher UA levels. None of the
variables relating to nutritional intake were significantly associ-
ated with UA per analysis of data from a smaller, fully adjusted
model using 2005­2006 data only (data not shown).
Discussion
In this study, we defined percentiles of UA distribution in a
nationally representative sample of adolescents 13­18 y of age.
Furthermore, we examined the relationship of UA with dietary
factors as well as with multiple demographic and clinical char-
acteristics. We also examined independent determinants of
UA levels.
There are no reference ranges of values for plasma UA in
children and adolescents based on large population studies.
Earlier studies reported a mean of 3.6mg/dl (range 2.0­6.7) in
204 children aged 0­13 y hospitalized for a variety of illnesses
(18). In a more recent single-center study using a different
assay, UA levels were found to vary with age and sex, the ranges
being 2.3­6.0mg/dl and 3.5­8.0mg/dl for 13-y-old female
and male participants, respectively (19). In the same study, the
authors used adult values as reference intervals for female par-
ticipants 13 y of age and male participants 17 y old.
In our cohort, UA levels followed a normal distribution. The
mean UA level was 5.14 ± 1.45mg/ dl (range 1st­99th percen-
tile, 2.8­8.7mg/dl). UA levels were higher in male participants
than in female participants; also, the levels increased with BMI
in a linear fashion, consistent with recently published data by
Lee et al. (20).
Age-related and race-related differences in serum UA levels
have not been well described. In our cohort, white adolescents

had significantly higher UA levels as compared with both black
and Hispanic adolescents.
There is a relationship between socioeconomic status and
obesity in both adults and children in the United States (21). In
developing nations, children living in poverty generally expe-
rience true protein­energy malnutrition, whereas in devel-
oped nations poverty predisposes to obesity and micronutrient
malnourishment (22). Although poverty and protein­energy
malnutrition have been shown to lead to lower serum UA lev-
els (23), no relationship between socioeconomic status and UA
has previously been described in developed nations.
Our data show the highest UA levels to be associated with the
highest percentage of children living in poverty, whereas UA
levels in the range 4.3­5.1mg/dl was associated with the lowest
percentage of poverty. Also, our data reveal a J-shaped rela-
tionship between UA and the intake of all dietary components
except fiber. Previous investigations regarding the association
between dietary intake and UA showed increased serum UA
levels with higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (24),
calories (25), and protein (25,26), and lower intake of vitamin
C (27). A study using NHANES data in adults revealed that a
higher intake of fiber correlated with lower serum UA levels
(28), which is consistent with our findings. However, a small,
prospective study in Norway showed no effect of increased
fiber intake on serum UA levels in adults (29). The observed
relationships suggest that dietary factors do relate to UA levels
but do not solely explain higher or lower UA levels. Dietary
factors did not remain as an independent determinant of UA
levels in the final regression model (Table 5).
The prevalence of HTN in our cohort was 2.9%, which is
close to the value of 3.7% previously reported from older
NHANES data by Din-Dzietham et al. (30,31), but lower than
the value of 4.5% reported by Sorof et al. in a population of
children in a major metropolitan city (31). These differences
are probably related to data from differing time periods as
regards the former study, and differences in study population
(including higher BMI) as regards the latter study.
Results of recent studies support the possible role of UA as
a mediator of high BP (1,2). In this study, we classified the
cohort's BP values on the basis of age, height, and gender as
normotensive, prehypertensive, and hypertensive. A total
of 269 adolescents had an abnormal BP classification, which
was significantly associated with the UA quartile trend, P <
0.001. Our findings are consistent with those of Gruskin and
colleagues, who compared adolescents having essential HTN
to age-matched, healthy controls with normal BP and found
that those with HTN higher serum UA levels (32). Feig and
Johnson observed that the mean serum UA level in children
with "white-coat HTN" was 3.6 ± 0.7mg/dl; in those with sec-
ondary HTN it was higher (4.3 ± 1.4mg/dl, P = 0.008), and
in children with primary HTN UA was significantly elevated
(6.7 ± 1.3mg/dl, P = 0.001) (2).
To our knowledge, there have been no previous large pedi-
atric studies examining the relationship between UA and
microalbuminuria. The inverse relationship observed in this
cohort is possibly influenced by the inclusion of a poorly nour-
ished group with lower UA levels (reflected by dietary intake
data and higher C-reactive protein). Also, it is important to
stress that the albuminuria levels in this cohort were below
those that are considered to be clinically relevant in adult pop-
ulations; the significance of microalbuminuria in children has
not yet been elucidated.
Our finding that the highest C-reactive protein levels are
in the lowest UA quartile group is intriguing and may reflect
the presence of a possibly poorly nourished group in the low-
est quartile. Of note, few previous studies demonstrated a
"U-shaped" or a J-shaped relationship between various cardio-
vascular outcomes and UA levels (33,34).
Given the lack of universally accepted upper normal lim-
its for UA in adolescents, we built three statistical models to
examine two different cutoff points considered as represent-
ing elevated UA (95%, and UA levels in the upper weighted
quartile of UA (data not shown)), and a third model to exam-
ine predictors of UA level considered as a continuous variable.
The determinants of UA were similar in the three models, with
gender, race, BMI z-score, and age representing independent
determinants of UA level. Systolic BP, diastolic BP, BP classi-
fication, urinary ACR, dietary factors, and poverty­income
ratio did not remain as independent determinants in the final
model. It is possible that BP did not remain in the final model
because of the relatively small number of adolescents with
elevated BP in the cohort. An alternative possibility is that it
did not remain in the final model because of its significant but
weak correlation with BMI z-score.
Our study had some limitations. Although we were able to
examine the relationship between UA levels and other vari-
ables, the nature of the study design did not allow for exam-
ination of causality. Another limitation of the study was the

Serum uric acid in US adolescents
limited volume of dietary data collected from the NHANES
2005­2006 participants. In addition, the retrospective nature
of our study, along with the reliance on dietary recall, instills
inherent limitations as compared with a prospective study
involving strict dietary control. Despite these limitations, our
study, which used data from the largest nationally representa-
tive sample of adolescents for the purpose of defining refer-
ence ranges for serum UA, was also the first to examine the
relationship between UA levels and dietary factors, poverty,
and BP classification. It is also worth noting that the NHANES
database involves the use of the same assay to measure UA lev-
els, thereby eliminating differences in measurement methods
frequently encountered in multicenter studies. It also used a
standardized BP classification based on the fourth report on
the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of high BP in children
and adolescents (35). Also, conducting the study in a healthy,
young cohort minimized confounding by comorbidities, which
is a major weakness of existing smaller studies.
Conclusions
This work defines the frequency distribution of serum UA
levels in a sample that is representative of the US adolescent
population, and examines the relationship between UA levels
and multiple demographic and biochemical characteristics as
well as known cardiovascular risk determinants such as BP and
diet. Sex, age, race, and BMI z-score were found to be inde-
pendent determinants of higher UA levels. Further prospective
studies are needed to address the relationship between UA lev-
els and cardiovascular morbidities in pediatric patients.
Methods
Study Population
Data from the NHANES for the years 2005­2008 were analyzed.
NHANES is an ongoing nationally representative cross-sectional
survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population and uses a
complex, stratified, multistage probability design. The survey is per-
formed by the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for
Diseases Control and Prevention, and the results are released in 2-y
increments. Survey participants underwent standardized interviews,
physical examinations, and laboratory testing in their homes and at a
mobile examination center (MEC).
Serum UA measurements were obtained for all individuals 12
y of age in NHANES 2005­2008. Of the 2,125 children and adoles-
cents 12­19 y of age, valid measures for serum UA were available
for n = 1,912. In our study, analysis was limited to data relating to
adolescents 13­19 y of age for whom serum UA measurements and
complete data on other variables of interest were available (n = 1,725).
Because dietary intake information is not reported in the public-access
NHANES 2007­2008 data, the analysis of the association between UA
and dietary intake was limited to adolescents from NHANES 2005­
2006 (n = 925).
NHANES 2005­2008 was approved by the National Center for
Health Statistics Institutional Review Board. All participants 18 y of
age provided informed consent; for those <18 y of age, parents/guard-
ians provided informed consent.
Study Variables
The demographic variables included in our study were age, gender,
and self-reported race/ethnicity (categorized as non-Hispanic black,
non-Hispanic white, Mexican American, and other). Poverty­income
ratio is the ratio of a family's income to the poverty threshold as
defined by the US Census Bureau. In NHANES, a poverty­income
ratio 1 was defined as being below the poverty threshold.
Detailed information on dietary intake was collected from the
2005­2006 NHANES participants during the MEC. Food intake his-
tories were used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and bev-
erages consumed during the 24-h period before the interview and to
estimate intake of energy, nutrients, and other food components from
those foods and beverages. All NHANES participants were eligible for
two 24-h dietary recall interviews. The first dietary recall interview
was collected in person during the MEC. The second interview was
by telephone 3­10 d after the MEC. Average dietary intake was used
in the analysis.
Physical measures were obtained in the MEC in accordance with
standardized protocol (36). Using a mercury sphygmomanometer,
three measurements of systolic and diastolic BP were obtained for
each participant. The participants were classified as having HTN if
this mean value was  the 95th percentile for age, sex, and height,
and as having pre-HTN if the mean BP was  the 90th percen-
tile but < the 95th percentile (35). The BP index (mean BP divided
by the 95th percentile of BP for age, gender, and height) was cal-
culated for each participant. Each participant's height and weight
were measured. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared. BMI z-scores were calculated based
on 2000 Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention growth
charts (37). Laboratory procedures are described in detail in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(38) Serum UA levels were measured using a colorimetric method.
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured using latex-
enhanced nephelometry. Serum cholesterol levels were measured
on the Beckman Synchron LX20 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).
Urinary albumin levels were measured using a solid-phase fluores-
cent immunoassay. Urinary creatinine levels were measured using
the Jaffe rate reaction with a CX3 analyzer (Beckman ASTRA,
Brea, CA). The urinary ACR was calculated as urinary albumin
value divided by urinary creatinine value. An ACR 30 was used
to define albuminuria. Serum creatinine was measured by means
of the modified kinetic Jaffe reaction. Because differences were
noted in serum creatinine values from the 1999­2000 survey when
compared with a "gold standard," a correction factor was applied
to adjust for errors in measurement. Glomerular filtration rate was
estimated using the Schwartz formula (39).
Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using Stata (SE 10.1; Stata, College Station,
TX). Standard errors for all estimates were obtained using the Taylor-
linearized variance estimation. Four-y sample weights were used to
account for the complex sampling design of NHANES, including
unequal probabilities of selection, oversampling, and nonresponse. A
P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Mean values for continuous variables and proportions for categori-
cal variables were estimated on the basis of weighted UA quartiles.
Statistical significance of linear trends across patient characteristics
was determined by linear and logistic regression for continuous and

categorical variables, respectively. Weighted percentiles of the distri-
bution of UA were estimated using quantile regression, utilizing ana-
lytical weights. Weighted linear regression models (least squares) were
utilized to examine the associations between UA and demographic,
socioeconomic, and dietary risk factors.
The relationship between BP and UA was first examined using the
frequency distribution of UA levels based on BP classification. Next,
the relationship between BP and weighted UA quartiles and the rela-
tionship between BP index and UA levels were examined.
