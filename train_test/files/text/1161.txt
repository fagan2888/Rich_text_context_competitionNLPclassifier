The 2004 National Nursing Home Survey collected cross-sectional data for 11,939 nursing home
residents aged 65 years representing 1.32 million individuals. That year, 24.6% of nursing
home residents had diabetes as a primary admission and/or current diagnosis. Diabetes was
present in 22.5 and 35.6% of white and nonwhite residents, respectively. Diabetic residents were
admitted more often from acute care hospitals (42.5 vs. 35.3%), were more likely to have a length
of stay 100 days (22.6 vs. 20.1%), and took more medications (10.3 vs. 8.4). Diabetic residents
had 39% higher odds of having emergency department visits in the previous 90 days and 56%
higher odds of having a pressure ulcer at the time of the survey. In the U.S. in 2004, one in four
nursing home residents aged 65 years had diabetes, and diabetic residents had increased odds
of several unfavorable outcomes that are important for care planning.

There is an incomplete picture of di-
abetes in institutionalized popula-
tions, including older adults in
nursing homes. This report defines the
prevalence of diabetes in U.S. nursing
homes and examines ethnic disparities,
activities of daily living, reasons for ad-
mission, payment sources, length of stay
(LOS), pressure ulcers, emergency de-
partment visits, and medication usage
among diabetic residents.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The 2004 National
Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) is based
on data collected in 1,174 nursing homes
for 13,507 residents (1). Primary diagno-
sis codes at the time of admission and at
the time of survey (current) and up to 15
current secondary diagnosis codes were
collected.
Race/ethnicity, current age, living
arrangements before admission, and
sources of payment were recorded. LOS
was calculated at the time of the survey.
Activities of daily living were collected in-
cluding bed mobility, transfer, dressing,
eating, toileting, personal hygiene, and
bathing. Residents were coded as one of
five categories: independent, requires su-
pervision, requires limited assistance,
requires extensive assistance, or total de-
pendence or that the activity did not oc-
cur; residents in the "total dependence"
and "did not occur" categories were com-
bined (2). Data on falls and fractures in
the 6 months before the survey, emer-
gency department visits in the 90 days
before the survey, and pressure ulcers and
medications at the time of the survey were
recorded.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted with SUR-
VEYMEANS, SURVEYFREQ, and SUR-
VEYLOGISTIC procedures in SAS. These
account for strata, cluster, and weight
variables defining the NNHS sampling
methodology and were used to generate
results that are generalizeable to U.S.
nursing home residents aged 65 years.
RESULTS -- Of the 13,507 nursing
home residents in the 2004 NNHS,
11,939, representing 1.32 million resi-
dents, were aged 65 years. Of these,
3.6% had diabetes as the primary admis-
sion diagnosis, 5.6% had diabetes as the
primary diagnosis at the time of the survey,
and 24.6% of residents, representing
324,000 individuals, had diabetes as a
primary admission and/or current diagno-
sis.
Diabetic nursing home residents were
younger (mean age 81.7 years) than those
without diabetes (84.9 years, P 
0.0001). Among residents aged 65­74,
75­84, and 85 years, diabetes prevalence
was 36.1, 29.5, and 18.3%, respectively
(P  0.0001). Diabetes was present in
35.2­37.5% of nonwhite residents, com-
pared with 22.5% among whites. Relative
to whites, nonwhite residents had about
twice the odds of having diabetes.
Nearly 35% of diabetic residents were
admitted with circulatory problems, com-
pared with 27.3% of nondiabetic resi-
dents (P  0.0001). Diabetic residents
had lower LOS (763 vs. 841 days, P 
0.01), and the proportion of diabetic res-
idents with LOS 100 days was slightly
higher (22.6 vs. 20.1%, P  0.05) than
that of nondiabetic residents. Diabetic
residents used more medications (10.3)
than nondiabetic residents (8.4, P 
0.0001).
Diabetic residents were admitted
more frequently from acute care hospitals
(42.5 vs. 35.3%, P  0.0001). At admis-
sion, diabetic residents were less likely to
pay with private insurance (10.5 vs.
12.4%, P  0.03) and out-of-pocket re-
sources (34.4 vs. 40.6%, P  0.0001) and
more likely to utilize Medicare (44.0 vs.
39.6%, P  0.001) and Medicaid (35.7
vs. 32.6%, P  0.05).
With the exception of transfers, total
dependence in activities of daily living
differed by only 1% between diabetic
and nondiabetic residents. In the 6
months before the survey, diabetic resi-
dents had slightly fewer falls and fractures
(34.7 vs. 37.5%, P  0.03). Altogether,
10 and 7.4% of diabetic and nondiabetic
residents had emergency department vis-
its in the 90 days before the survey. Nearly
14 and 9.4% of diabetic and nondiabetic
residents had a pressure ulcer at the time
of the survey, yielding 56% higher odds of
ulceration among diabetic residents.
CONCLUSIONS -- In 2004, approx-
imately one in four U.S. nursing home
residents aged 65 years had diabetes, a
figure representing 324,000 individuals.

reports, together with our data, suggest a
steady increase in diabetes as a condition
of primary focus in U.S. nursing homes;
in 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2004 (current
data), the prevalence of diabetes as the
primary current diagnosis in nursing
homes was 4.4, 4.6, 5.0, and 5.6%, re-
spectively (3­5). Ethnic disparities in
diabetes prevalence that are well docu-
mented in the community (6) continue
into the nursing home setting. The odds
of diabetes were about two times higher in
black and Hispanic nursing home resi-
dents relative to white residents. To the
extent that demographic shifts and popu-
lation projections will apply to nursing
homes, it is likely that nonwhites, partic-
ularly persons of Hispanic origin, will be-
come more highly represented in the
nursing home population in the future
(7).
Diabetic nursing home residents had
a somewhat more "postacute/rehabilita-
tion" profile than nondiabetic residents.
They were admitted more often from
acute care hospitals, were slightly more
likely to have stays of 100 days at the
time of the survey, and paid for care with
Medicare more often than nondiabetic
residents.
Diabetic residents were younger than
their nondiabetic counterparts, and dia-
betes decreased as age increased. The de-
crease in diabetes with increasing age may
reflect selective mortality associated with
diabetes and/or early cardiovascular mor-
bidity (8,9).
Our observation of fewer falls and
fractures in diabetic nursing home resi-
dents is inconsistent with previous com-
munity-based research (10,11). Diabetes
may play a less significant role in the risk
of falls and fractures in nursing homes be-
cause residents are frailer and may share a
more homogenous risk profile than elders
in the community. However, diabetic
nursing home residents had 56% in-
creased odds of having a pressure ulcer at
the time of the survey and were also more
likely to have had an emergency depart-
ment visit in the past 90 days. It was not
surprising that diabetic residents used
more medications, an observation noted
previously in a study of nursing home ad-
missions (12).
Clinical practice guidelines are avail-
able for people with diabetes (13), older
adults with diabetes (14), and diabetic in-
dividuals in long-term care (15,16). Nev-
ertheless, the evidence base supporting
clinical decision making for diabetes in
nursing homes is sparse, partly because of
the difficulty of conducting clinical trials
in this population. Given the expected in-
crease in the number and complexity of
nursing home residents with diabetes in
the coming decades and the paucity of
clinical research providing guidance for
their care, future efforts should focus on
filling the knowledge gap by first defining
end points that are appropriate for dia-
betic people in nursing homes and then
designing clinical trials around these out-
comes.
