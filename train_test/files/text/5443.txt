Attempts to Measure Globalization
The first decade of the 21st century saw the development of
numerous instruments with which to measure globalization
processes.1 These are instruments that differ from each other
in many respects, not infrequently because of different inter-
pretations of the concept of globalization on which they are
based. In this regard, a first distinction can be drawn between,
on the one hand, indexes that attempt to capture the multidi-
mensional nature of globalization and, on the other, those that
focus exclusively on one dimension of the process, which is
very often--but not always--the economic one. Considering
that multidimensionality is one of the most characteristic fea-
tures of globalization, this article will consider only instru-
ments that adopt a multidimensional approach.
But besides differing because they take or do not take a
multidimensional approach to measuring the phenomenon,
globalization indexes are also distinguished by the choice of
dimensions to be considered, the indicators used in con-
structing the index, the weights assigned to the indicators
themselves, as well as the techniques by which the latter are
aggregated. A further feature that differentiates among
attempts made to date to measure globalization is whether
they are essentially sporadic or, conversely, whether the
instruments used are able to consolidate over time.
In this regard, four main instruments have received pro-
gressive development and at least some updating of the data
on which they are constructed. First, there is the A. T.
Kearney/Foreign Policy Globalization Index (The Global
Top 20, 2007): This has been the first globalization index to
gain some visibility in the scientific debate, given that all the
authors who have subsequently attempted to develop global-
ization indexes have made reference to it, although not infre-
quently doing so in critical terms. Then there are the CSGR
Globalisation Index (Lockwood & Redoano, 2005), the
Maastricht Globalisation Index (Martens & Raza, 2010), and
finally the KOF Index of Globalization (Dreher, Gaston, &
Martens, 2008), which, among the instruments mentioned, is
perhaps the most interesting as it is the one for which the data
have been most frequently updated, the last occasion being
in 2013.2

Nation States, Cities, and People:
Alternative Ways to Measure
Globalization
Marco Caselli1
Abstract
In the first decade of the 21st century, attempts to measure globalization have multiplied, and they have led to the devising
of diverse instruments, most notably the A. T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Globalization Index, the CSGR Globalisation Index,
the KOF Index of Globalization, and the Maastricht Globalisation Index. Besides important similarities as regards structure,
the dimensions considered, and the indicators used, the main feature shared by these instruments is the fact that they all
use the same unit of analysis: the nation-state. This is a somewhat paradoxical situation, if one considers that one of the
most distinctive characteristics of globalization is precisely that its dynamics extend beyond the state and the country. Gives
this premise, the aim of the article is, on the one hand, to justify in any case the use of instruments that seek to measure
globalization on the basis of states, and, on the other, to propose alternative approaches to such measurement. The article's
underlying assumption is that different approaches to the measurement of globalization are not mutually exclusive. Rather,
such a plurality of perspectives is opportune and desirable given the complexity and multidimensionality of the concept of
globalization.

results that they have yielded, to be emphasized here is the
remarkable similarity in the underlying structure of the four
indexes mentioned, as evidenced in Table 1.
All four indexes, in fact, consider the economic and political
dimensions of globalization. Likewise, all four of them consider
both the social dimension--though the A. T. Kearney/Foreign
Policy Globalization Index gives it a different name--and the
technological dimension of the phenomenon, although the
CSGR Globalisation Index and the KOF Index of Globalization
consider these two dimensions jointly. The only exception is the
Maastricht Globalisation Index, which, unlike the other three
instruments, also includes an ecological dimension.
Because the cultural dimension of globalization is partic-
ularly difficult to measure,3 none of the above four indices
includes it among its fundamental dimensions. Nevertheless,
all the instruments comprise indicators and variables that can
be entirely or partly related to the cultural aspects of global-
ization, and which are included in either the social or the
technological dimension.
Comparison of the results of the four indices is compli-
cated by the fact that they refer to different years and are
calculated for a more or less extensive range of countries.4
However, Table 2 is an attempt to make such a comparison
based on the relative positions of each country according to
each index and limiting the analysis to the 55 countries for
which all four indices have been calculated.
A first finding that emerges from the table is that the highest
places in the rankings of all four indexes are mainly occupied by
member-countries of the European Union, and particularly ones
of small size.5 This finding prompts the question of the extent to
which the instruments effectively measure the degree of global-
ization of countries and the extent to which, instead, they mea-
sure regionalization dynamics. Accordingly, it would be
advisable for globalization indexes to consider not only flows
and relations between a particular country and other countries,
but also the number6 and the geographical position of those
same countries (De Lombaerde & Iapadre, 2007). However,
this undertaking would encounter the difficulty of collecting
similar information, and the only (moreover partial) attempt in
this direction has been made by Vujakovic (2010).
Inspection of Table 2 also shows that, while some coun-
tries are ranked by the various indices in substantially similar
manner--this is the case, for example, of Switzerland,
Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand, Romania, Thailand, and
Venezuela--there are others which the various instruments
considered allocate to very different positions. This is the
(striking) case of the United States, a country considered
highly globalized by the A. T. Kearney/Foreign Policy
Globalization Index and by the CSGR Globalisation Index
(5th and 4th position respectively) but which occupies decid-
edly lower positions in the classifications drawn up on the
bases of the KOF Index of Globalization and the Maastricht
Globalisation Index (22nd and 36th position respectively).
Other countries whose positions are not determined unequiv-
ocally are, for example, Canada, China, Russia, and Panama.
These considerations show that estimates of the global-
ization levels of individual countries may vary even mark-
edly according to the measurement instrument used. This
means that the choices made when constructing the instru-
ments--especially selection of the indicators, as well as
deciding the aggregation procedure and the weights--have
important repercussions on the results obtained.
Now that the results of four globalization indexes have
been presented, albeit partially, some brief considerations
can be made concerning the use of these results. First, as sug-
gested in Table 2, the results can be used synchronically to
compare the levels of globalization of different countries.
But they can also be used diachronically to consider the tem-
poral dimension to analyze the different speeds and trajecto-
ries with which countries are globalizing (or, conversely,
de-globalizing): a temporal dimension of especial signifi-
cance because globalization is a process. For this purpose,
however, the data necessary to calculate globalization
indexes should be collected systematically and continuously
in time, but this systematicity and continuity today seem
guaranteed only, as said, by the KOF Index of Globalization.
The Nation-State as the Unit of
Analysis for Globalization Indices: Pros
and Cons
The indices presented in the previous section, as well as
many others, are rather heterogeneous, but they are united by
the fact that they all use the same unit of analysis: namely the
nation-state. This choice is made "for convenience" because

available in regard to globalization have the state as the unit
of analysis (Scholte, 2005, pp. 86-87). But this is not surpris-
ing if we consider that statistics and the use of indicators
originally arose in regard to the state (Parra Saiani, 2009, pp.
9-10)--as demonstrated by the etymology itself of the word
"statistics."
Yet the somewhat obligatory choice of this unit of analy-
sis raises some particularly problematic issues. One suspects,
in fact, that measuring globalization by referring to the
nation-state is to distort the very essence of the concept stud-
ied. As already pointed out by the scientific debate, it is of
crucial importance to distinguish between globalization and
internationalization: While the latter refers to processes and
dynamics occurring within and in relation to the system of
nation-states, the concept of globalization refers (also) to
processes that unfold heedless of that system (Sklair, 1999,
pp. 144-145). In this regard, various authors have stressed
that the distinctive feature of globalization is deterritorializa-
tion (Giaccardi & Magatti, 2003; Sassen, 2000; Scholte,
2000, pp. 48-9), or the emergence of processes entirely free
of territorial constraints--processes, that is, which may be
situated anywhere or, conversely, nowhere (in virtual space
for example).
In light of these considerations, reflection on the theme of
globalization has induced several authors to dispute what has
been variously labeled "methodological nationalism" (Beck,
2004), "embedded statism" (Sassen, 2000), or "methodolog-
ical territorialism" (Scholte, 2000): that is, the perspective
largely dominant since the origins of the social sciences and
which envisages a substantial overlap between the concept of
society and that of the nation-state, which is therefore con-
sidered the natural container of economic, cultural, and polit-
ical processes.
That of the nation-state, therefore, cannot be the only per-
spective, the only lens through which one studies and analy-
ses a multidimensional and above all multiscalar process like
globalization (Sassen, 2007). However, this does not mean
that it is illegitimate to use the nation-state as the unit of anal-
ysis for construction of a globalization measure. Affirming
the existence of deterritorialized dynamics and processes is
not to deny the persisting and in many respects renewed
importance of the spatial dimension of globalization.
Globalization, in fact, is an extremely complex phenomenon,
and part of its complexity resides in the fact that it can be
interpreted from different points of view: The deterritorial-
ized dimension of globalization does not exclude the local-
ized one, and the global dimension does not exclude the local
one. The national point of view is therefore one of the many
legitimate points of view from which globalization can be
read (Beck, 2004). This is of particular importance if one
considers that the state contributes substantially to shaping
globalization processes: For example, it is the state that fur-
nishes the infrastructures--particularly for transport and
communications--that make possible the transnational flows
that constitute the essence itself of globalization (Axford,
2007, pp. 322-323). Added to this is the fact that
nation-states continue to be key actors in the economic and
social spheres (Ray, 2007, p. 75) as well as essential referents
in the everyday lives of all the planet's inhabitants.
Apart from practical convenience, therefore, using the
nation-state as the unit of analysis in the study and measure-
ment of globalization processes is in many respects an
acceptable procedure. However, this should not obscure the
fact that this procedure, however legitimate, allows the ana-
lyst to grasp only some aspects of globalization and not oth-
ers, even though they are extremely significant. It has been
pointed out, for example, that it is almost impossible to mea-
sure the ecological aspects of globalization by working on
national bases (Dreher et al., 2008, p. 38). More generally,
there is the problem of grasping more genuinely global
aspects of the process on the basis of international data
(Scholte, 2005, pp. 86-87). Nevertheless, if globalization
processes are distinguished by their multiscalar nature, the
problem is not so much finding and using units of analysis
alternative to the nation-state as combining several units of
analysis and, therefore, different perspectives of inquiry.
This is said in the awareness that no perspective and no unit
of analysis, on its own, can enable an exhaustive account to
be made of the complexity of globalization processes.
Different Approaches
Although, for the reasons given above, it appears anyway
acceptable to measure globalization on the basis of states--the
paradox remains that studied at this level is a phenomenon
among whose essential features is that, in certain significant
domains, it annuls states, their role, and their boundaries. This
latter consideration prompts the question as to whether instru-
ments can be devised that measure globalization using other
units of analysis. It should nevertheless be immediately
pointed out that attempts in this direction should not be
regarded as antithetical to, or in conflict with, the most com-
mon approach based on the state. In fact, as repeatedly empha-
sized, globalization is an extraordinarily complex process that
can be analyzed and interpreted from numerous standpoints
that are not alternative to each other but, on the contrary, com-
plementary. As Beck (2004) puts it, the logic that guides us
when analyzing globalization should not be that of "either . . .
or . . . " but rather "both . . . and . . . "
In the same vein, Sassen (2007) explains--as already
recalled in the previous section--that a distinctive feature of
globalization is its multiscalar nature. That is to say, global-
ization exerts its effects differently according to the territo-
rial level considered--from the neighborhood to the planet
as a whole. But there is something more. The effects of glo-
balization differ not only according to territorial level but
also according to social level. For example, by virtue of the
so-called "mobiletic revolution" (Gross, 1966; Russett,
1967; Scidà, 1996, 2007), globalization transforms distances
and therefore the configuration of physical space. Some dis-
tances shorten until they almost disappear and are no longer
obstacles against human action, while others diminish much
Caselli 5
less markedly. The extent of this contraction of distance
depends primarily on the characteristics of the places
involved, and especially on the infrastructures with which
they are endowed: Ease of transport connections makes the
main cities of Europe or North America much closer to each
other than are villages in many African countries. But it also
depends on the characteristics of the people involved: For
example, the distance between the European Union and
Kenya is much shorter for the average citizen of the former
than it is for the average citizen of the latter.
Given these premises, a first unit of analysis--different
from but, as said, not alternative to the state--which can be
used to construct an index of globalization is the city. This
unit of analysis has already been used by the instruments
proposed by Taylor (2004), in particular the one designed to
measure Global Network Connectivity, and by the A. T.
Kearney/Foreign Policy Global Cities Index (The 2008
Global Cities Index, 2008). These are instruments very dif-
ferent from each other in the number of cities taken into
account and the way in which they are constructed,7 although
they yield largely similar results: As shown in Table 3, in
fact, fully 9 cities appear in the top 10 positions in the Global
Network Connectivity and the Global Cities Index.
Here, however, my intention is to focus in particular on
another possible unit of analysis for the construction of
instruments with which to measure globalization: the person.
Given that it has not yet been systematically applied, in the
next section suggestions will be made in regard to its possi-
ble definition and implementation.
The Person-Based Approach
There are authors who point out that, with some exceptions,
the human person is largely neglected by theories of global-
ization (Ley, 2004; Ray, 2007, p. 39). If this is so, it is not
surprising that the instruments devised to measure the phe-
nomenon have to date used units of analysis different from
the person. Nevertheless, I argue that an approach to the
measurement of globalization that focuses on the single
individual is broadly justifiable and, indeed, potentially very
fertile for understanding the complex and multiform dynam-
ics with which globalization manifests itself. This contention
is borne out by the fact that, within a particular state, but also
in a particular city, globalization can and has very different
effects and meanings for different people. Added to this is
the fact that the world is not just a set of states, it is also a set
of people, whose relationships are not always mediated by
their membership of a state or nation (Sen, 2002, p. 66).
Yet the aim of this section is not to devise an instrument
for the measurement of globalization whose unit of analysis
is the persons. Instead, its more modest intention is to put
forward suggestions on how such an instrument could be
constructed.8
Broadly speaking, I believe that a Person-Based
Globalization Index (PBGI) should consider the following
six main dimensions: (a) possession of the resources and the
abilities necessary to move and act in the global scenario; (b)
effective mobility and activity in supranational and tenden-
cially global domains; (c) belonging and a sense of belong-
ing to global, or at any rate nonterritorial, entities; (d)
exposure to global flows of mass communication; (e) partici-
pation in global, or at any rate supranational, communication
flows; and (f) degree of global consciousness.
Possession of the Resources and the Abilities
Necessary to Move and Act in the Global
Scenario
The ability to act in a context more extensive than the local
and national one, and the ability to live, so to speak, global-
ization and not just undergo its consequences derives from
possession of certain specific capacities and material
resources. Indicators of this dimension could be, for instance,
knowledge of an international lingua franca (primarily
English), possession of a passport, possession of a credit
card, access to the Internet and the ability to use it, and the
amount of personal income. In regard to the first of these
indicators--relative to language--it might be objected that
this would benefit a priori the citizens of English-speaking
countries. I would respond to this objection by pointing out
that knowledge of English (but also other languages, perhaps
with the attribution of diversified weights) is anyway an
objective and important factor in the ability to move in the
global scenario. It should therefore be considered.
Effective Mobility and Activity in Supranational
and Tendencially Global Domains
Endowment with the above-mentioned resources and capacities
may give rise to different forms--and especially intensities--of
action in the global sphere. An element certainly to be consid-
ered is the international physical mobility of the subjects stud-
ied. In particular, one indicator could be the number of times in
which, in a given period of time, a national border has been

crossed. However, this indicator should be combined with infor-
mation relative to the number of borders crossed, as well as to
the locations of the countries visited, the purpose being to distin-
guish (or at any rate evaluate differently) globalization from
regionalization--or from commuting dynamics, as in the case
of transfrontier workers: This problem has already been men-
tioned when examining the results of the tools that measure glo-
balization on the basis of the nation-state.
Consideration could also be made of information con-
cerning the range of action of people's jobs and investments.
Further indicators could be the frequency with which sub-
jects find themselves in what Marc Augé (1992) calls "non-
places": That is, spaces devoid of local features and therefore
able to minimize the cultural attrition due to travel and action
in foreign countries, such as airports or hotels belonging to
the great international chains. Again, this dimension could
comprise the deliberate use and consumption of foreign
products.9
Belonging and a Sense of Belonging to Global, or
at Any Rate Nonterritorial, Entities
As rightly emphasized by Sen (2002, p. 63), people increas-
ingly identify with groups, or they have a sense of belonging,
which are genuinely global in that they exist not through but
despite national boundaries. This is a dimension that cannot
be immediately translated into empirical terms, and whose
detailed definition would be beyond the scope of the present
discussion. However, I suggest that its principal indicator
might be membership of, and activity in, groups of suprana-
tional extension. Tied to the sense of global belonging is also
the spread of cosmopolitan lifestyles, attitudes, and relations
(Hannerz, 1990). However, this is a key dimension of that
cultural globalization that is very hard to grasp by using ter-
ritorial indicators. A PBGI instead appears decidedly more
promising, although identification of the specific indicators
to use would require reflection falling outside the scope of
this contribution. A proposal might be to use statements
reflecting a more or less cosmopolitan vision of the world,
and with which the subjects studied would express their
degree of agreement or disagreement. The dimension of the
sense of global belonging would thus also include, ulti-
mately, the sharing of planetary-level values and principles,
such as those expressed by the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. However, the inclusion of references to val-
ues in an instrument intended to be applicable to a global
scale appears problematic. In fact, the risk of ethnocentrism
is very high--and consequently so too is the risk that the
instrument will not gain wide recognition.
Exposure to Global Flows of Mass
Communication
A particularly important aspect of globalization is the exis-
tence of communication flows that traverse the planet in
asymmetric and fundamentally unidirectional manner. There
are consequently news stories--but also images, values, and
patterns of consumption--which may be known to all or
almost all of the planet's inhabitants, and which all or almost
all of the planet's inhabitants can form an opinion about or
discuss.An indicator of this dimension could be, for instance,
the frequency with which people watch or listen to interna-
tional television or radio news broadcasts, the frequency
with which they visit international information websites, or
their knowledge about certain global events (for example,
the venue of the last Olympic Games or the last World
Football Championships).
Participation in Global, or at Any Rate
Supranational, Communication Flows
The inhabitants of the Earth are not just passive recipients of
the information and communication flows that traverse the
planet. Very often, they themselves generate such flows,
especially in the form of interpersonal communications at a
distance. Indeed, thanks to the development of communica-
tion media and abatement of their costs, our planet is swathed
by an extremely dense network of communications; a net-
work whose existence is a further distinctive feature of glo-
balization, and whose nodes are single individuals (or small
groups). Indicators of this dimension could be the interna-
tional contacts--telephone calls, SMS, email exchanges, and
other contacts via the Web, as well as those through social
networks like Facebook--made in a particular interval of
time. In this case, too, as suggested above in regard to physi-
cal mobility, consideration should be made of the number
and the locations of the countries involved in such exchanges,
so that it is possible to distinguish genuinely global factors
and situations from others that also come about on a suprana-
tional scale.
Degree of Global Consciousness
"Global consciousness" is probably the aspect of globaliza-
tion that is most difficult to study, and which, therefore, is
least studied (Holton, 2005, p. 39). This is so despite the fact
that--as emphasized since the first studies on the phenome-
non (Giddens, 1991; Robertson, 1992)--it is one of the con-
stitutive dimensions of globalization itself. And also despite
the fact that the manner in which people interpret globaliza-
tion processes, as well as their emotional reactions to them,
play a crucial role in determining the strategies and the
courses of action enacted individually and collectively in
response to globalization. For example, the difficulty of
implementing joint supranational policies to address issues
of global importance, such as protection of the natural envi-
ronment or the management of economic and financial cri-
ses, is probably due to the fact that, as some authors suspect,
there is still insufficient awareness of the global reach of
such issues (Kennedy, 2010, p. 5). Measurement of global
Caselli 7
consciousness is precluded to instruments that use territorial
units of analysis, but it becomes possible when the unit of
analysis is the person--which further testifies to the poten-
tial of this approach. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that
the concept of global consciousness is very difficult to opera-
tionalize: that is, convert into empirically measurable terms.
In this case, too, I suggest as possible indicators various
stimuli with which to record the degree of agreement or dis-
agreement of informants with statements concerning interde-
pendence relations among different parts of the planet.
Besides theoretical considerations that may modify,
enrich, or even reverse my suggestions concerning the pos-
sible dimensions and indicators with which to construct a
PBGI, when creating such an instrument, a practical problem
of particular importance would arise. Unlike the indices
based on states or cities, in fact, a PBGI cannot be calculated
on the basis of secondary data--that is, data collected from
already-existing statistical sources. Nor, as in the case of the
instrument proposed by Taylor, can it be calculated on the
basis of information obtainable with "desk work"--for
example, the exploration and analysis of websites. It will be
instead necessary to go into the field and directly question a
sample of informants: An operation that obviously entails
difficulties in terms of organization and costs. In this regard,
while a survey conducted on a planetary scale is unthinkable,
ones of lesser extent, but nevertheless multilocal in scale, are
feasible. However, the degree of territorial coverage will be
less than that obtained by using the other instruments men-
tioned in the previous sections.
Given this difficulty and this consequent limitation, the
construction of a PBGI should move through a first experi-
mental phase, during which the largest possible number of
indicators are tested for each of the above-suggested dimen-
sions, as well as possible others. Subsequently, the results of
this first phase should serve to select the indicators, among
all those tested, to be included in the definitive PBGI. These
indicators should be as few in number as possible. A particu-
larly "slender" instrument, in fact, would not require the con-
duct of an ad hoc survey; on the contrary, it could be easily
inserted into the numerous surveys periodically carried out
in almost every part of the world, thus making the datum of
the PBGI available on a potentially global scale.
Having stated the difficulties involved in the construction
of a PBGI, also to be emphasized is what instead is one of its
main strengths. This consists in the fact that, because the per-
son is an elementary unit, the data collected in this way can
then be combined in multiple different forms. The person-
based approach, therefore, is not incompatible with those
based on states or cities. For the information collected and
organized by means of a PBGI would also be able, for exam-
ple, to show the percentage of globalized subjects resident in
a state or a city, and also in a sub- or supranational region.
But this same information could also be used to compare the
different levels of globalization among the members of dif-
ferent professions, or among different scientific communi-
ties, where the last two categories cut across the nation-state
dimension. Besides comparing the different levels of global-
ization, a PBGI could easily be used to identify and analyze
the factors that most influence the degree of globalization of
a person, community, or geographical area. The data of a
PBGI would be characterized, that is to say, by high mallea-
bility, and they could therefore be adapted to different needs
of research and analysis. Finally, as already emphasized in
regard to the globalization indexes based on states, a PBGI
could be used not only for synchronic comparisons but also
for diachronic analysis. However, the latter would require
further effort in data collection, with more surveys at regular
intervals.
Conclusion
In conclusion, globalization is a multiscalar and multidimen-
sional process difficult to grasp in its many aspects with a
single measurement instrument. The simultaneous use of
tools based on different units of analysis could nevertheless
furnish a sufficiently rich and comprehensive account of its
main dimensions.
However, there are crucial elements of globalization that
cannot be grasped with tools that use the state, the city, or the
person as their unit of analysis. This concerns the systemic
elements of globalization, which can only be captured if the
entire planet is used as the unit of analysis. Some of these
elements, particularly those of an economic kind like the vol-
ume of world trade in proportion to global GDP, can be eas-
ily measured and used, in particular to determine their
evolution over time. Instead, other elements, consisting of
"indivisible" factors that involve all the inhabitants of the
Earth, regardless of their spatial locations and social circum-
stances (Caselli, 2004), appear more difficult if not impossi-
ble to measure. These factors are, for example, the
sustainability and exploitation of natural resources, or the
threat raised by the existence of nuclear weapons. To these
should be added the existence of certain procedures, tech-
niques, and "expert systems" now used on a truly global
scale. These are the procedures, techniques, and "expert sys-
tems which make possible the flows of money, products,
ideas, and people that the current globalization indices seek
to measure. While these elements may not be measurable, it
should nevertheless be stressed that a PBGI--and this is a
further advantage of it--could quantify the degree of aware-
ness of their existence among people; in other words, as
emphasized in the previous section, it could measure that
"global consciousness" which constitutes a key component
of globalization itself.

Notes
1. This contribution draws on and develops discussion in Caselli
(2012).
2. See http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch
3. To be mentioned in this regard is the Cultural Globalization
Index proposed by Kluver and Fu (2008).
4. With reference to the most recent data offered by each instru-
ment, in fact, the A. T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Globalization
Index has been calculated for 72 countries, the CSGR
Globalisation Index for 103, the Maastricht Globalisation
Index for 117, and the KOF Index of Globalization for 187.
5. Small and/or less populated countries are, so to speak, forced
to have relations with other countries. For this reason, the
CSGR Globalisation Index has introduced a correction fac-
tor--in relation to economic indicators alone--which takes
account of certain physical and demographic characteristics of
the country considered. See Lockwood and Redoano (2005).
6. If, for instance, a country records high trade volumes, but these
are primarily directed toward only one other country, this does not
mean that it is strongly globalized; on the contrary, it means that it
is strongly dependent (Kluver & Fu, 2008, p. 341).
7. For details once again see Caselli 2012.
8. For this reason, not discussed here are certain crucial technical
aspects of construction of an index of this kind: for instance,
the weighting of the indicators or the translation of the infor-
mation collected in the field into aggregable values (normal-
ization). For thorough examination of the options available to
the researcher, see Caselli (2012, pp. 22-24).
9. I have emphasized "deliberate" because consumers very often
do not know the real origins of the products that they use: In
the absence of such awareness, it is difficult to collect informa-
tion useful for construction of the index.
