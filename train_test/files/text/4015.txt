Abstract: "Hooking-up" ­ engaging in no-strings-attached sexual behaviors with
uncommitted partners ­ has become a norm on college campuses, and raises the potential
for disease, unintended pregnancy, and physical and psychological trauma. The primacy of
sex in the evolutionary process suggests that predictions derived from evolutionary theory
may be a useful first step toward understanding these contemporary behaviors. This study
assessed the hook-up behaviors and attitudes of 507 college students. As predicted by
behavioral-evolutionary theory: men were more comfortable than women with all types of
sexual behaviors; women correctly attributed higher comfort levels to men, but
overestimated men's actual comfort levels; and men correctly attributed lower comfort
levels to women, but still overestimated women's actual comfort levels. Both genders
attributed higher comfort levels to same-gendered others, reinforcing a pluralistic ignorance
effect that might contribute to the high frequency of hook-up behaviors in spite of the low
comfort levels reported and suggesting that hooking up may be a modern form of
intrasexual competition between females for potential mates.

Introduction
In recent years, "hooking up" has become part of the cultural consciousness of
adolescents and young adults. Hook-ups consist of sexual behaviors between partners in the
absence of a traditional romantic relationship and without the promise of other benefits.
They are often considered a form of "no-strings-attached" (NSA) sex.
Hooking up has become a norm on college campuses throughout North America
(Bogle, 2008; Paul, McManus, and Hayes, 2000). The "dating scene" has disappeared from
many campuses, and uncommitted sexual behavior takes place in the absence of a
Pluralistic ignorance and hooking up
traditional romantic relationship framework (Reitman, 2006). A majority of individuals in
college student populations studied so far have reported at least one casual sexual
experience or hook-up (England, Shafer, and Fogarty, 2007; Garcia and Reiber, 2008;
Grello, Welsh, and Harper, 2006; Gute and Eshbaugh, 2008; Lambert, Kahn, and Apple,
2003; Paul, McManus, and Hayes, 2000). The prevalence of hook-ups varies from campus
to campus, likely as a result of ecological differences between college environments,
historical time of data collection, age of participants, and the demographics of the
population being surveyed. However, estimates consistently range from nearly 65% to
approximately 80% of undergraduate participants reporting having engaged in a hook-up at
least once in their college career (England, Shafer, and Fogarty, 2007; Garcia and Reiber,
2008; Lambert, Kahn, and Apple, 2003; Paul and Hayes, 2002; Paul, McManus, and
Hayes, 2000).
Popular interest in the topic is ubiquitous, evidenced by the spate of books
addressing it, including such exemplars as The Hookup Handbook: A Single Girl's Guide
to Living It Up (Rozler and Lavinthal, 2005), The Happy Hook-Up: A Single Girl's Guide
to Casual Sex (Sherman and Tocantins, 2004), Hooking Up: A Girl's All-out Guide to Sex
and Sexuality (Madison, 2006), and an occasional retort, such as Unhooked: How Young
Women Pursue Sex, Delay Love, and Lose at Both (Stepp, 2007). Exposés fill the pages of
magazines (Reitman, 2006), attempting to understand the shift in how young women
approach sex and relationships, while young adult magazines conduct and publish results
from massive electronic polls about the hook-up behavior of their readership (Seventeen
Magazine, 2006). Popular cosmetic companies use slogans such as "hook-up perfect" to
widely market and sell beauty products to young women. Academic contributions to the
topic of hooking up are fewer, but the body of literature is growing; for example, see
Hooking Up: Sex, Dating, and Relationships on Campus (Bogle, 2008).
Popular media coverage may be sensationalistic, and undoubtedly influences
attitudes and sexual behavior in adolescents and young adults. However, the hook-up
phenomenon is not merely a creation of the media; rather, the media seems to be reflecting
an actual shift in behavior. Such casual sexual experiences among college students are by
no means a product of the 21st century; "one-night stands" and "casual sex" have been
studied without the current "hook-up" context (Boswell and Spade, 1996; Cates, 1991;
Maticka-Tyndale, 1991). However, the high prevalence of these behaviors, coupled with an
openness to display and discuss them, appears to be recent, particularly with respect to
women (see Reitman, 2006).
Pluralistic ignorance (PI) has been demonstrated to play a role in hook-up behavior.
PI is characterized by individuals behaving in accordance with (generally false) beliefs
attributed to the group, regardless of their own beliefs (Fields and Schuman, 1976; Miller
and McFarland, 1987). Lambert, Kahn, and Apple (2003) found that young adults routinely
believe that others are more comfortable with various sexual behaviors than they,
themselves, are. This leads them to behave as if they were more comfortable than they
actually are, and engage in behaviors with which they are not actually comfortable. Note
that if everyone is affected by this fallacy, no one will be behaving in accordance with their
own beliefs and comfort levels. As a result, research on hook-ups has focused on personal
consequences (e.g., Fielder and Carey, in press; Lambert, Kahn, and Apple, 2003; Paul and
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(3). 2010. -391-
Pluralistic ignorance and hooking up
Hayes, 2002; Paul, McManus, and Hayes, 2000), including the convoluted issue of consent
and its ramifications (particularly for women), and the role of alcohol and/or drugs in hook-
up behavior on campuses. However, there remains the broader question of why individuals
harbour such false beliefs about the social norm, and whether the patterns of beliefs are
predictable, and thus, potentially correctable. We expect that because human psychological
processes are the product of evolution, the capacity and tendency to exhibit pluralistic
ignorance ­ particularly with respect to sexual/reproductive behavior ­ must reflect the
evolved best interest of individuals, and thus be predictable on the basis of evolutionary
theory and sexual selection.
Behavioral-Evolutionary Approach and Predictions
It is likely that a complex set of interacting factors ­ human evolution, evolved
neurobiology and psychological processes, social and cultural context ­ all contribute to the
expression of uncommitted sexual behavior (see Garcia and Reiber, 2008). It is possible
that novel sociocultural factors are currently driving up the prevalence of contemporary
NSA sexual hook-up behavior. However, we expect that the evolved psychology
underlying sexual behavior will still be apparent and contributing to contemporary
expressions of sexual behavior. Here we focus specifically on evolutionarily designed
psychological responses ­ specifically, psychological comfort levels that might elucidate
the PI effect.
Humans are, as a species, biological organisms with a polygynous evolutionary
history. Thus, male humans are, on average, expected to be more sexually eager than
female humans, and females are, on average, expected to be relatively "coy" and choosy
concerning mates and mating (Buss, 1989, 2003; Daly and Wilson, 1983; Low, 2000;
Symons, 1979). The higher potential male reproductive rate (Clutton-Brock and Parker,
1992) and lower cost of reproduction to males (Trivers, 1972) should lead to males seeking
out a variety of mates and engaging in sex often. That men willingly and eagerly engage in
hook-up behavior is therefore not surprising. But the lower potential female reproductive
rate (Clutton-Brock and Parker, 1992) and higher cost of reproduction to females (Trivers,
1972) should lead to female reluctance to engage in sexual (historically, costly and
potentially reproductive) behavior in the absence of resources, security, and/or commitment
from a potential partner. Even the less-obvious potential advantages to women, such as
good genes and immediate access to resources, seem not to apply. That women engage in
hook-up behavior therefore demands an explanation.
Several predictions follow from these evolutionary sex differences. First, men are
predicted to be more comfortable than women with all hook-up behaviors. Second, each
gender is predicted to know the gender-specific strategy of the opposite gender. Compared
to their own comfort levels, men are predicted to attribute to women lower comfort levels
with all sexual hook-up behaviors, and women are predicted to attribute to men higher
comfort levels with all sexual hook-up behaviors. This is consistent with evolutionary
interpretations of the importance of recognizing and responding to "in-group" norms
(Kurzban and Neuberg, 2005), and with evolutionary error management theory, which
argues that natural selection can lead to adaptively biased systems of judgment (Haselton
and Buss, 2000).

Pluralistic ignorance and hooking up
Third, individuals of each gender are predicted to know the gender-specific strategy
of their own gender. For men, the comfort levels they attribute to other men (for all sexual
behaviors) are predicted to be higher than the comfort levels they feel themselves. In
evolutionary terms, this would lead to men being more likely to engage in such behavior
even if they personally have a lower comfort level, thus potentially increasing reproductive
success. Thus, this is an evolutionarily predictable demonstration of PI. For women,
however, the comfort levels they attribute to other women can discriminate between two
competing evolutionary hypotheses. On one hand, women could be predicted to attribute to
other women comfort levels that are quite similar to, or lower than, the comfort levels they,
themselves, feel. This might result if a belief in other women's greater discomfort and
restraint reinforced the stereotypical choosy coyness of females, and led women to more
conservative sexual behavior, and thus, fewer errors in sexual (potentially reproductive)
decision-making. On the other hand, modern Western women live in cultures in which
there are simultaneously large differentials in male resources and status, and imposed
marital monogamy, the combination of which is expected to provoke intrasexual
competition among females for potential mates (Gaulin and Boster, 1990). Engaging in
uncommitted sex may be one form of female-female competition. If this is so, we would
predict that women attribute to other women comfort levels that are higher than they,
themselves, feel; this would generate PI that would heighten women's awareness of
potential threats from female competitors and may motivate women to engage in
competition.
Current Study
Goals of the current survey were to: 1) assess the prevalence of hook-up behaviors
in a random sample of students at the target university, 2) evaluate the PI effect by
assessing participants' own comfort levels with various hook-up behaviors, as well as the
comfort levels they attribute to others of the same and opposite genders, and 3) evaluate the
predictions of the behavioral-evolutionary approach with respect to hook-up behaviors.
This will set the stage for a larger risk-reduction project at the target university, including
the development of a holistic educational intervention program geared at breaking down the
PI effect by disseminating accurate evolutionarily-informed behavioral information.
Materials and Methods
Survey Procedures
The use of humans as research subjects in this study was approved by the
appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the study was carried out in a manner
consistent with the requirements of the IRB. Data included in this report were collected as
part of a larger, 70-item, self-report questionnaire containing demographic information as
well as a history of sexual behavior and intimate relationships. The questionnaire focused
on experiences and motivations surrounding hook-up behavior. At the beginning of the
questionnaire, hook-up behavior was defined for participants as follows: "A hook-up is a
sexual encounter between people who are not dating or in a relationship, and where a more
traditional romantic relationship is NOT an explicit condition of the encounter."

Pluralistic ignorance and hooking up
The questionnaire was administered electronically via StudentVoice
(www.studentvoice.com), a higher-education assessment provider. The questionnaire was
uploaded and formatted to their web-based survey tool. StudentVoice randomly generated a
sample of 1,000 undergraduate email addresses from the population of approximately
11,500 undergraduates attending the university. To protect potential participants and
maintain complete anonymity, this list was not shared with the researchers (Thus, no
comparisons can be made between responders and non-responders). A voluntary
recruitment email was sent to these 1000 students requesting their participation in the
study, and providing a link to the web-based survey. Potential participants were notified
that the study was completely anonymous and that they could skip any question(s) they did
not wish to answer. Six hundred fifty-three students responded to the invitation by clicking
the link and reading the introductory materials (informed consent and description of the
survey). Of those, 507 (77.6%) continued beyond the informed consent and description,
and provided the data analyzed here.
Survey Participants
Participants included 507 undergraduate students at a mid-sized public university.
The sample was 55% female (n = 277) and 45% male (n = 227). The mean age of
participants was 19.7 years (SD = 1.7). Participants included 42% first-year/freshmen (n =
214), 28% second-year/sophomores (n = 140), 16% third-year/juniors (n = 82), and 14%
fourth-year/seniors (n = 71).
Survey Questions
For comparison purposes, the substantive questions on the survey were designed to
be consistent with the methodology of others studying PI and hook-up behavior, notably
Lambert, Kahn, and Apple (2003), following Prentice and Miller's (1993) application for
alcohol use. Students used an 11-point scale to rate comfort levels of self and others with
various hook-up behaviors. The anchor points of the scale were labelled "very
uncomfortable" and "very comfortable", respectively, and the midpoint was labelled
"neutral." Diverging from Lambert, Kahn, and Apple (2003), the midpoint of the scale was
set at zero in this study so that feelings reflecting negative states (i.e., discomfort) were
rated as negative numbers, and feelings reflecting positive states (i.e., comfort) were rated
as positive numbers. Thus, the range of this 11-point scale was -5 to +5, with a midpoint of
0 (neutral). Participants responded to 3 questions about sexual behaviors:
(1) How comfortable are you with engaging in the following activities during a
hook-up?
(2) Think of the average person of the same sex as you. How comfortable do
you think this person of the same sex is with engaging in the following
activities during a hook-up?
(3) Think of the average person of the opposite sex as you. How comfortable
do you think this person of the opposite sex is with engaging in the
following activities during a hook-up?

Pluralistic ignorance and hooking up
The five behaviors that participants rated for each question were: sexual touching above the
waist, sexual touching below the waist, oral sex (giving), oral sex (receiving), and
intercourse. Participants also indicated which of these behaviors they had actually engaged
in during a hook-up.
Analyses
Data were imported into SYSTAT v.10.2 for Windows for analyses. We collected
data on many demographic and life-history variables ­ age and year in school, religiosity,
ethnicity, family composition and upbringing ­ for complex exploratory analyses that will
inform our ongoing longitudinal work. However, the first step is a simple assessment of the
prevalence of various behaviors and an evaluation of attitudes. These basic summaries of
the data are presented here (percents, means, standard deviations).
Results
Prevalence of Specific Hook-Up Behaviors
When asked to self-report whether they had hooked up, 64% of participants
reported having done so. However, when asked about specific sexual behaviors, only 19%
indicated that they had not engaged in any of the specific sexual behaviors in the context of
a hook-up. Therefore, in actual behavioral terms, 81% of the participants had engaged in
some form of sexual behavior during a hook-up.
There was tremendous variation in prevalence of the various sexual behaviors that
comprise hook-ups. Overall, 58% of participants reported having engaged in sexual
touching above the waist during a hook-up, and 53% reported sexual touching below the
waist during a hook-up. Performing and receiving oral sex during hook-ups were reported
by 36% and 35% of participants, respectively. Intercourse during a hook-up was reported
by 34% of participants. Nineteen percent of participants reported having engaged in none
of these behaviors during a hook-up. Table 1 shows the prevalence of the various hook-up
behaviors by gender. It is important to note that this is not a closed sample; that is,
participants could have engaged in these behaviors with individuals who are not part of this
sample. Thus, for instance, it is not contradictory that 40% of women report having
performed oral sex, but only 36% of men report having received oral sex.

Comfort Levels, PI, and the Behavioral-Evolutionary Predictions
Comfort levels were rated on a scale from +5 (very comfortable) to -5 (very
uncomfortable. Women reported being somewhat comfortable (M = 2.72, SD = 3.13) with
sexual touching above the waist during a hook-up, fairly neutral (M = 0.92, SD = 3.91) with
sexual touching below the waist, somewhat uncomfortable with oral sex as performer (M =
-1.87, SD = 3.80) and receiver (M = -1.99, SD = 3.68), and even more uncomfortable with
intercourse (M = -2.23, SD = 3.62). On average, men reported being highly comfortable
with sexual touching above the waist (M = 3.36, SD = 2.99) during a hook-up, and
somewhat comfortable with sexual touching below the waist (M = 3.02, SD = 3.14). Men
were fairly neutral with oral sex as performer (M = 0.48, SD = 4.05), but much more
comfortable with oral sex as receiver (M = 2.91, SD = 3.19) during a hook-up; and they
were somewhat comfortable with intercourse (M = 2.26, SD = 3.62) during a hook-up.
Figure 1 shows men's and women's reported comfort levels with various sexual behaviors
during a hook-up, and illustrates that for all sexual behaviors, men reported higher comfort
levels than women. This supports the first prediction.

Figure 2 illustrates women's (top panel) and men's (bottom panel) comfort levels
with various hook-up behaviors, and the comfort levels that each gender attributes to others
of the same and opposite gender. Table 2 shows the means (and standard deviations) for
these results. What is clear from this table is that women attributed to men higher comfort
levels (than the women themselves had) with every behavior. This supports the second
prediction. Moreover, the comfort levels attributed to men by women were higher than
what men actually reported. Similarly, men attributed to women lower comfort levels (than
the men themselves had) with every behavior. This also supports the second prediction.
Men overestimated women's comfort levels with every behavior.

Pluralistic ignorance and hooking up
Individuals of both genders attributed to others of the same gender higher comfort
levels than they themselves had (Table 2). For men, attributing higher comfort levels to
other men supports the third prediction. For women, attributing higher comfort levels to
other women is consistent with the female-competition hypothesis. Both of these results
expose evolutionarily-predictable instantiations of PI.

The prevalence of hooking up in the current study is within the range reported by
other studies. Eighty-one percent of participants in the current study report having engaged
Pluralistic ignorance and hooking up
in some form of sexual hook-up behavior. This is slightly higher than the 78% reported by
Paul, McManus, and Hayes (2000). In addition, the sex difference in intercourse during a
hook-up found by Paul, McManus, and Hayes (2000) was not found in this study. While
they reported 47.5% of men and 33% of women engaging in intercourse during a hook-up,
the current study found 35% of men and 32% of women reporting intercourse during a
hook-up. This difference might be explained by differences in university type, structure,
size, student body demographics, overall environment, or a number of other factors.
Although we do not predict strict consistency between various campuses, large-scale
surveying is continuing at the target university to explicate this issue.
In the current study, as in several others (Cohen and Shotland, 1996; Knox and
Wilson, 1981; Lambert, Kahn, and Apple, 2003; Oliver and Hyde, 1993), men reported
higher comfort levels than women with all sexual behaviors. They also overestimated
women's comfort levels with several of the behaviors, particularly the more serious
behaviors (i.e., oral sex and intercourse) that pose higher physical and/or mental health
risks such as sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, and/or psychological
injury. Men's higher comfort levels with these behaviors, paired with their overestimations
of women's comfort levels with these behaviors, may have unfortunate consequences
including men inadvertently pressuring women, and women outwardly succumbing to the
pressure in spite of their inward aversion to such behaviors in the context of hooking up.
Also building on the work of Cohen and Shotland (1996), Lambert, Kahn, and
Apple (2003), and Prentice and Miller (1993), the current study demonstrated clear patterns
of PI with respect to comfort levels with various sexual behaviors during hook-ups. For all
sexual behaviors, both genders attributed to others of the same gender higher comfort levels
than they, themselves, felt. This may help explain the high rates of these behaviors in spite
of the low comfort levels reported. For instance, while women reported moderate
discomfort with intercourse during a hook-up, 32% of women and 35% of men reported
having engaged in intercourse during a hook-up. Over a third of the women reported
engaging in oral sex (in one role or the other) even though women's comfort levels with
these behaviors were generally negative. The pressure to act in accordance with these false
perceived norms may be leading individuals to engage in behavior with which they are
uncomfortable, and that poses potential risks in terms of sexually transmitted diseases,
pregnancy, and psychological trauma.
These three factors ­ men's higher comfort, men's overestimation of women's
comfort, and women's overestimation of other women's comfort ­ may dovetail and
inadvertently result in sexual assault. As noted by Lambert, Kahn, and Apple (2003, p.132),
"In this context it is possible for a woman to experience sexual assault but not interpret the
behavior as such, believing it to be normative behavior with which her peers are
comfortable." Indeed, at the university where the current study took place, our university
counseling center's internal reports show rapidly rising numbers of women clients
presenting with symptoms generally considered sequelae of sexual assault. Yet, it is
increasingly common for these same women to outwardly deny having been sexually
assaulted. In other words, clients are presenting to the counseling center following
traumatic and regretful sexual hook-up experiences, but are seemingly not self-identifying
as victims or registering their discomfort as legitimate. It appears that women are behaving

Pluralistic ignorance and hooking up
in accordance with their false beliefs in spite of their own discomfort with particular sexual
behaviors, and are facing negative psychological and emotional consequences as a result.
These findings are also consistent with error management theory (Haselton and
Buss, 2000). Specifically, Haselton (2003) has used error management theory to suggest a
sexual overperception bias where men genuinely misperceive women's sexual interest as
being greater than it actually is, but there is no bias in women's sexual inferences. This can
then lead to purposeful manipulation. Paired with the PI effect that applies to hook-up
behavior, this sets the stage for conceivably dangerous sexual activity where partners have
differing and misinformed perceptions of their engagement, with potentially severe clinical,
psychological, and potentially legal ramifications.
Behavioral-Evolutionary Paradigm and Implications
Our data support the predictions of the behavioral-evolutionary paradigm. First,
men were predicted and found to be more comfortable than women with all hook-up
behaviors. Second, each gender was predicted to know the gender-specific strategy of the
opposite gender. Compared to their own comfort levels, men were predicted and found to
attribute to women lower comfort levels with all behaviors, although they overestimated
women's comfort levels with all behaviors, consistent with Haselton (2003). Compared to
their own comfort levels, women were predicted to attribute to men higher comfort levels
with all behaviors. The current study also found support for this, although women
overestimated men's comfort levels with all behaviors. This is consistent if interpreted as a
protective mechanism; that is, women believing that men in general are more comfortable
with sex in all its forms than they really are (i.e., women perceiving men as more sexually
permissive), might make women more guarded and careful prior to engaging in sexual
activity.
Third, each gender was predicted to know the gender-specific strategy of their own
gender. The comfort levels attributed by men to other men (for all sexual behaviors) were
predicted and found to be higher than the comfort levels men reported for themselves. In
evolutionary terms, this would lead to men being more likely to engage in such behavior in
spite of their own (lower) comfort levels, thus potentially increasing reproductive success.
Women were found to attribute higher comfort levels to other women than they,
themselves, felt. This is consistent with women viewing other women as competitors for
mates, and is somewhat paradoxical given the definition of "NSA" sex ­ that no
relationship exists, and no relationship is on offer. Although the vast majority of these
participants reported having no actual expectation that hook-ups would develop into
traditional romantic relationships, 51% (of both men and women) indicated the desire to
initiate a traditional romantic relationship when asked to identify the factors that motivate
them to hook up (data reported elsewhere; see Garcia and Reiber, 2008). This evidence,
like that of Fisher (2009), strongly suggests that "NSA sex" may not actually be "string-
free." In fact, "NSA sex" may be an oxymoron. This conflict between behavior, desires and
perceptions regularly puts young adults at risk of negative consequences from the PI effect.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. It represents a cross-sectional snapshot of a

Pluralistic ignorance and hooking up
single point in time. Further studies will be required to understand change over time for
these behaviors and the associated attitudes and perceptions. This will be important to
assess the impact of aging, experience, and related factors on these behaviors and/or
attitudes. Additionally, the collected reports of actual hook-up behavior in this study are
retrospective, but the data on comfort levels reflects feelings at the time of the survey.
Comfort levels reported may be affected not only by previous experience, but also by peer
reactions to behavior. Thus, for example, it should not be concluded from this study that all
32% of women participants who reported having engaged in intercourse during a hook-up
were markedly uncomfortable with it during the actual event. Such a conclusion would
require concurrent reports of behavior and comfort levels. Future studies are planned to
address these important issues.
Future Directions
These findings illustrate the power of an evolutionary approach in understanding
psychological phenomena such as Pluralistic Ignorance (PI). If evolution fosters PI in
predictable ways, and PI contributes to actual uncommitted sexual behavior, then an
understanding of evolutionary psychology will be important in the development of
successful holistic health education programs aimed at undermining PI and addressing
sexual behavior (along with other high-risk behaviors) and the associated negative
downstream sequelae.
Social norms marketing is "...a theory and evidence-based methodology for
addressing health and social justice issues that can be used to foster (healthy)
environments..." (Berkowitz, 2006, p. 2). Others have pointed to the success of social
norms marketing programs in reducing the PI surrounding alcohol use on campuses, and
noted the similarity between alcohol use and hook-up behavior in terms of the PI effect (see
Lambert, Kahn, and Apple, 2003). While social norms marketing may serve as a strong
health promotion model for colleges (Haines, 1998), no intervention programs aimed at
breaking down the PI surrounding hook-up behavior have been described in the literature.
Research and program planning is continuing at the target university. We intend to
continue surveying on an ongoing basis to track trends in these sexual behaviors, and to
develop and implement an educational campaign about sexual (hook-up) behavior on
campus that is similar to the "Most of Us" program for alcohol use (see DeJong and
Langford, 2002; Haines, 1998; Perkins, 2003; Perkins, Haines, and Rice, 2005).
Collaboration with the campus counselling center, the student life office, and the student
health service will aid in designing and implementing a strong and consistent program
across campus, and assessing the impact in multiple domains. By consistently
disseminating accurate information about hook-up attitudes and behavior on campus, the PI
surrounding hooking up may be reduced, leading to changes in behavior and reducing
negative outcomes (e.g., psychological and physical trauma, harm to reputation, sequelae of
sexual assault, sexually transmitted diseases, and unintended pregnancy). We neither
condemn nor condone sexual activity, but rather, we endorse the need for young adults to
be aware of, honestly communicate, and act in accordance with, their own comfort levels
and those of their partner(s) during engagement in sexual activity.
