Introduction
Attitudes toward same-sex marriage have changed dramati-
cally over the last decade. U.S. adults are becoming more
supportive of same-sex marriage, and there are a number of
reasons for this increase. In the 1988 General Social Survey
(GSS), only 12.5% of theAmerican public agreed or strongly
agreed that same-sex marriages are acceptable (Smith,
Marsden, & Hout, 2015); however, by 2003, one third of the
American public supported same-sex marriage (Pew
Research Center, 2013). Today, public opinion polls show
that half or more of the public support same-sex marriage
(Pew Research Center, 2013; PollingReport.com, 2014;
Smith et al., 2015). These polls also show that support for
same-sex marriage has increased across all birth cohorts/age
groups over the last decade (e.g., Smith et al., 2015). Another
indicator of the change in cultural outlooks is the number of
states that now recognize same-sex marriage as legal.
Currently, 14 states have not legalized same-sex marriage.
However, that number is about to change as the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that same-sex couples have a right to marry any-
where in the United States.
Although the ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court may sug-
gest that research which examines support for same-sex mar-
riages is now moot, there are strong reasons to advocate
additional research on this volatile and timely social issue.
With the exception of legal abortion, few social issues have
been more divisive and garnished more media attention than
same-sex marriage. In addition, there are several issues such
as workplace rights and family law which will likely emerge
among gay-rights advocates and become a lightning rod for
social debate and political decision making. For example,
private- and religious-based schools may lose their tax-
exempt status should they refuse to alter their policies against
same-sex marriage. Moreover, the judicial decision reached
by the Supreme Court will surface in public debates among
political candidates at the state and federal levels. Hence,
explicating the variables that influence attitudes regarding
same-sex marriage remains an important topic for social sci-
ence research.
Our research focuses on differences in attitudes toward
same-sex marriage as they are shaped by religiosity and spir-
ituality across birth cohorts. The impact of religion on issues
related to sexuality and family needs little documentation
(e.g., Sherkat & Ellison, 1999), while the interest in spiritual-
ity is a more recent topic among scholars (Hill et al., 2000).
Religiosity refers to an individual's level of emersion within
a religious community--often defined by the liturgical doc-
trines of the denomination. Spirituality connotes an outlook

Religiosity, Spirituality, and Attitudes
Toward Same-Sex Marriage: A
Cross-Sectional Cohort Comparison
David A. Gay1, John P. Lynxwiler1, and Patrick Smith1
Abstract
Attitudes toward same-sex marriage have changed dramatically over the last decade. U.S. adults are becoming more supportive
of same-sex marriage, and there are a number of reasons for this change. Our research examines the relationship between
cohort, religiosity, spirituality, and attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Using data from the 2012 and 2014 General Social
Surveys, we examine the differential impact of religiosity and spirituality by cohort on attitudes toward same-sex marriage.
We present models for four separate cohorts: The Millennials, Generation X, the Baby Boomers, and the Silent Generation.
The Millennial cohort exhibits significant differences from the other birth cohorts. The results of our analyses locate various
changes in these attitudes and provide directions for future research.

that is grounded, not in religion, but in a distinct approach to
the world that eschews established organizational ties
(Chaves, 2011). We elect to examine attitudinal variations by
birth cohorts because they have been shown to be important
predictors for attitudinal outlooks regarding sexuality and
family (Lewis & Gossett, 2008; Smith, 1994). Prior to 1988,
few studies examined the religious, spiritual, and secular
correlates of public attitudes toward same-sex marriage
(Sherkat, Powell-Williams, Maddox, & de Vries, 2011). The
GSS included the question about same-sex marriage in 1988
and has in every survey since 2004. In the last decade, other
national probability surveys such as the Pew Research Center
have included similar questions. We use the 2012 and 2014
GSS years because they include items that tap religiosity,
spirituality, and attitudes toward same-sex marriage and
afford the opportunity to examine differences across younger
and older birth cohorts. Although it would be highly useful to
examine the role of religiosity and spiritualism as they affect
the mundane experiences of individuals who must interpret
and incorporate these values into their daily lives (Walls,
Woodford, & Levy, 2014), our research relies on survey data
that cannot tap into this aspect pertaining to same-sex mar-
riages. However, our analysis does point to an important
component of the cultural resources that establishes the basis
for an individual's syncretism (Woodford, Walls, & Levy,
2012).
The trends in attitudinal change are not evenly distrib-
uted across birth cohort/generation, religious identification,
religious participation, belief, or subjective spirituality.
Recent research (Jones, Cox, & Navarro-Rivera, 2014;
Taylor, 2014) shows significant differences in outlooks by
cohort over the last decade. Current research identifies four
cohorts for comparisons of social attitudes and behaviors:
(a) the Millennial cohort, (b) Generation X, (c) the Baby
Boom cohort, and (d) the Silent Generation (e.g., Bengtson,
Putney, & Harris, 2013; Gay & Lynxwiler, 2013; Jones
et al., 2014; Taylor, 2014). These researchers identify the
Millennial cohort as people who were born between 1981
and 1996, Generation X as those who were born between
1965 and 1980, Baby Boomers as those who were born
between 1946 and 1964, and the Silent Generation as people
who were born before 1945. We follow this operationaliza-
tion for our cohort comparisons of attitudes toward same-
sex marriage.
The purpose of our study is to examine cohort compari-
sons of religiosity and subjective spirituality on attitudes
toward same-sex marriage in three ways. First, we examine
mean differences in attitudes among the four cohorts in the
analysis with and without controls. Second, we regress atti-
tudes toward same-sex marriage on birth cohort, religiosity,
spirituality, and control variables for the entire sample. Third,
we run separate regression analyses to assess the relationship
between religion and spirituality on attitudes toward same-
sex marriage within each cohort controlling for sociodemo-
graphic variables.
Religiosity, Spirituality, and Same-Sex
Marriage
Religious intensity and commitment can be manifested in a
number of ways. Religiosity involves a number of elements
or facets of one's life, and there are multiple aspects as to
what the term or concept conveys (see Ellison, Gay, & Glass,
1989; Glock & Stark, 1965). The literature examining the
relationship between religiosity and social attitudes and
behaviors has a long history in social science research.
Recent research demonstrates that various aspects of religi-
osity impact attitudes toward same-sex marriage (Jones
et al., 2014; Olson, Cadge, & Harrison, 2006; Sherkat et al.,
2011). Personal identity with a religious tradition, denomina-
tion, or family of denominations reinforces personal out-
looks of what is viewed as acceptable or unacceptable
behavior. Van Geest (2007) suggests that conservative evan-
gelical Protestants are more likely to see same-sex marriage
as a moral issue that runs counter to their value systems.
Mainline Protestants are much more in favor of gay rights
(Van Geest, 2008). Some research indicates attitudes of
Catholics appear to be becoming more in line with mainline
Protestants (Sherkat, de Vries, & Creek, 2010), even though
others (e.g., Olson et al., 2006) find differences. Hence, iden-
tity with a religious tradition likely affects attitudes toward
same-sex marriage and may vary by birth cohort. Steensland
et al. (2000) is currently the most widely used religious cat-
egorical scheme and is the operationalization for affiliation
in the present study. Public religious participation through
attendance at religious services reinforces these views.
Attendance at religious services promotes a social network
of individuals who are likely to share particular outlooks.
Belief in the literal interpretation of sacred writings and sub-
jective practices such as prayer are also important compo-
nents of religiosity. Recent research reports a significant
relationship between the subjective components of religios-
ity and attitudes toward same-sex relations (e.g., Barringer,
Gay, & Lynxwiler, 2013; Ford, Brignall, VanValey, &
Macaluso, 2009; Olson et al., 2006).
In addition, subjective spirituality can be an alternative to
religious influences on attitudes and behaviors. Even though
social scientists have addressed subjective spirituality in the
cohort and religion literature (e.g., Roof & McKinney, 1987;
Wuthnow, 2007), little research has examined the relation-
ship between subjective spiritual views and attitudes toward
sexuality and same-sex marriage. This study operationalizes
spirituality as spiritual but not religious (SBNR). Research
consistently recognizes a relationship between spirituality
and religiosity (e.g., Ammerman, 2013; Hill et al., 2000).
However, a significant percentage of the population concep-
tualizes spirituality as separate from religiosity and that is the
operationalization for the current analysis. Recent research is
beginning to examine the impact of SBNR identity on atti-
tudes toward same-sex sexuality (e.g., Barringer et al., 2013).
Our research extends this line of inquiry by addressing the
Gay et al. 3
possible influence of SBNR on attitudes toward same-sex
marriage and whether the influence varies by birth cohort.
Religious Affiliation
Recent research documents substantial religious denomina-
tional differences in attitudes toward same-sex sexuality
(Cadge, Olson, & Wildeman, 2008; Finlay & Walther, 2003;
Gay, Ellison, & Powers, 1996; Gay & Lynxwiler, 2010;
Loftus, 2001) and same-sex marriage (Burdette, Ellison, &
Hill, 2005; Jones et al., 2014; Sherkat et al., 2011). Personal
identity with a religious group is likely important in attitude
formation. For some time, research has assumed that reli-
gious denominations are the "locus of subcultural differ-
ences" (Jeffries & Tygart, 1974, p. 318). Even though the
term subculture carries varied connotations, it usually refers
to norms and practices that are shared by members of the
group that are distinct from the larger population. Hence,
attitudes toward same-sex sexuality and same-sex marriage
are likely to vary by religious affiliation and its correspond-
ing ideology. Recent research addresses the role denomina-
tion or religious tradition plays in influencing attitudes and
behaviors concerning the morality of same-sex sexuality
(Cadge et al. 2008; Kenneavy, 2012; Olson & Cadge, 2002;
Sherkat et al., 2010; Van Geest, 2007). Such studies show
that evangelical and sectarian religious traditions are the
least tolerant of same-sex relations. A major question in the
literature continues to be how we categorize religious affilia-
tion (Gay & Ellison, 1993; Roof & McKinney, 1987;
Steensland et al., 2000). Currently, the most widely used reli-
gious categorical scheme is the one developed by Steensland
et al. (2000), and it is the scheme used in the present study.
The Steensland et al.'s typology of religious traditions is
operationalized as Catholic, Jewish, mainline Protestant,
evangelical Protestant, African American Protestant, "Other"
affiliates, and unaffiliated/no religious preference. An impor-
tant aspect of this study is the variation of the religious tradi-
tion effect by cohort. Unfortunately, due to sample size issues
for certain religious groups in our society (e.g., members of
the Jewish faith, Mormon respondents, Muslims), our analy-
sis is restricted to the largest religious traditions in the
GSS data. They are Catholics, mainline Protestants, evan-
gelical Protestants, African American Protestants, and no
religious preference respondents. Hence, the study focuses
on Protestants, Catholics, and no preference respondents.
Public Religious Participation
Individuals who participate in public religious activities are
more likely to incorporate the ideas expressed in the larger
group. Attendance at religious services is the structured
activity that affords the most available route to public par-
ticipation. Attendance exposes the individual to norms
and practices of the group and reinforces attitudes
and behaviors associated with a particular religious
collectivity (Ellison et al., 1989; Jeffries & Tygart, 1974;
Sherkat et al., 2011). Evangelical religious traditions are
the most likely to be intolerant of same-sex relations (Gay
et al., 1996; Hertel & Hughes, 1987; Walls et al., 2014;
Woodford et al., 2012) while the more mainline Protestant
denominations have been more supportive of same-sex
relations (Kenneavy, 2012; Sherkat et al., 2010). Even
though attendance at religious services or public partici-
pation may reinforce the variations in attitudes by reli-
gious tradition, the bulk of the literature reports that
attendance overall reduces the support for same-sex mar-
riage (Becker, 2012; Cochran, Chamlin, Beeghley, &
Fenwick, 2004). Extending this line of inquiry, we exam-
ine the relationship between attendance at religious ser-
vices and attitudes toward same-sex marriage for each of
the four cohorts.
Biblical Literalism and Prayer
Two subjective aspects of religiosity are beliefs and prayer.
One of the most important aspects of the relationship between
religious belief and attitudes toward same-sex marriage in
the United States is a belief in the literal interpretation of the
Bible. For this study, the Bible is the primary sacred text for
the traditions in American mainline religion. Biblical literal-
ism is the belief that the words in the Bible were inspired by
God and are to be interpreted literally. This interpretation of
the Bible is most commonly found among evangelical
denominations of Christianity, although it is not exclusive to
them (Burn & Busso, 2005). Even though research reports
substantial heterogeneity within religious denominations,
evangelical and sectarian Protestant groups are much more
likely to interpret same-sex sexuality as morally wrong
(Kenneavy, 2012; Knust, 2011).
Prayer is also a significant component of subjective religi-
osity as individual religious behavior. Roof and McKinney
(1987) refer to individualistic phenomena as the "new volun-
tarism" that leads to enhanced privatization of faith that is
more anchored in personal realms. Using the 2014 GSS, a
simple cross tabulation of frequency of attendance and fre-
quency of prayer shows that roughly 30% of respondents
who never attend religious services pray at least once a day.
As Wuthnow (2007) points out, "prayer is fairly common
among the American public" (p. 128). Americans pray for all
kinds of reasons both internal and external, contrition and
thanksgiving, and personal and collective. Sociological
research uses frequency of prayer as an independent variable
(Ellison, Bradshaw, Flannelly, & Galek, 2014) and a depen-
dent variable (Baker, 2008). And some religious profession-
als encourage the use of prayer to search for a "life partner"
under certain circumstances. Finally, recent research
(Barringer et al., 2013) shows that the frequency of prayer is
related to attitudes toward same-sex relations. Hence, prayer
is included in our analysis of attitudes toward same-sex
marriage.

Subjective Spirituality
Subjective spirituality may have a different and more subtle
effect on attitudes toward same-sex marriage. It is a more
difficult concept to measure than religiosity and is influenced
by a variety of personal and societal factors (Ammerman,
2013). Spirituality is not necessarily institutionally grounded
and is subject to individual interpretations. It is more per-
sonal in definition (Roof, 1993, 1999). While studies consis-
tently show that the majority of Americans report that they
are both spiritual and religious (Marler & Hardaway, 2002),
roughly 15% of the 2012-2014 GSS respondents can be clas-
sified as SBNR. Heelas and Woodhead (2005) suggest that
Americans are increasingly using spirituality as a guide for
understanding in their everyday lives.
It is beyond the scope of this article to provide a definition
of "spirituality." The GSS does not ask respondents what
spirituality means to them. Some social scientists suggest
that religion and spirituality are distinct concepts (Schlehofer,
Omoto, & Adelman, 2008). Even though research clearly
shows that the two are not mutually exclusive (Marler &
Hardaway, 2002), a number of surveys (e.g., GSS) demon-
strate that a significant percentage of respondents report that
they are spiritual in one question but not religious in another.
While we may not know their subjective definitions, we do
know that the combination of the questions indicate that they
feel they are spiritual, but they do not feel they are religious.
Recent research reports that these SBNR attitudes are related
to favorable outlooks toward same-sex sexuality (Barringer
et al., 2013). This may very well extend to attitudes toward
same-sex marriage. Those who are SBNR are less likely to
attend religious services or identify with a particular denomi-
nation, and hence less likely to be influenced by a particular
religious organization's stance on same-sex relations. Recent
research shows that respondents identifying as SBNR varies
across birth cohorts (Gay & Lynxwiler, 2013).
Cohort, Religiosity, Spirituality, and Attitudes
Toward Same-Sex Marriage
As noted earlier, we are interested in the relationship between
cohort, religiosity, spirituality, and attitudes toward same-sex
marriage. Ryder (1965) is most frequently cited as the
researcher to emphasize cohort in the study of changes in
attitudes and behavior. Since this seminal work 50 years ago,
cohort comparisons have been used to examine a wide range
of attitudes and behaviors. Many of these studies use an Age/
Period/Cohort design. However, this study is limited to
cohort comparisons at one point in time because the data are
cross-sectional and some questions of interest are only asked
in certain years. Nevertheless, we can identify different birth
cohorts even though they are at different ages in 2012 and
2014. As noted earlier, support for same-sex marriage has
increased for all birth cohorts (Pew Research Center, 2015;
Smith et al., 2015). Whether or not attitudes change over the
life course is not our research question. Moreover, the issue
of same-sex marriage was not part of public discussion sev-
eral years ago. Why emphasize cohort when only cross-sec-
tional data are available? Birth cohorts were socialized in
different time periods and cultural epochs depending on the
time they were born. Baby Boomers experienced different
religious, cultural, and institutional aspects of society than
the Millennials. Generation X lived through different experi-
ences than the Silent Generation and so on. As a result, the
determinants of attitudes may vary across birth cohort
regardless of their current age. Therefore, we are interested
in more than simple age effects. Other researchers have also
examined cohort effects using GSS data (e.g., Sherkat et al.,
2010; Sherkat et al., 2011). We want to extend the literature
by examining the potential differential effects of religiosity
and spirituality on attitudes toward same-sex marriage by
cohort.
We follow the operationalization of birth cohorts used in
current social scientific studies (Jones et al., 2014; Pew
Research Center, 2013; Taylor, 2014). These surveys show
that younger birth cohorts (i.e., the Millennials and
Generation X) are more accepting of same-sex marriage than
their older cohort counterparts. But it is more than just a sim-
ple younger versus older distinction. Each of these polls
shows that support for same-sex marriage across cohorts is a
consistent, albeit unsurprising, pattern. The Millennials show
the highest level of support followed in order by Generation
X, the Baby Boomers, and the Silent Generation. While this
could be an age effect, it may also reflect a cohort effect. This
finding in and of itself does not tell us anything new.
However, little research has compared the determinants of
attitudes toward same-sex marriage within birth cohort. And
while research has examined the relationship between religi-
osity and cohort (Hoge, Johnson, & Luidens, 1994;Wuthnow,
2007; Smith, 2009), very little research addresses the rela-
tionship between religiosity, spirituality, cohort, and attitudes
toward same-sex marriage. Should Millennials and
Generation X carry their current attitudes toward religion,
same-sex marriage, and other social attitudes and behaviors
throughout their life course, our society will experience sig-
nificant change on several dimensions.
Millennials are more likely to report no religious prefer-
ence, and they attend religious services at lower levels than
all other cohorts. They pray less frequently and have the low-
est percentage of respondents who hold a literal interpreta-
tion of the Bible (Gay & Lynxwiler, 2013). Millennials have
the lowest proportion of respondents who identify with
denominations that are categorized as evangelical or main-
line Protestants. The percentage who identify as Catholics is
very similar to all other birth cohorts. For the most part, all
indicators are that they are less religious. Do these trends in
religiosity and spirituality across cohort affect attitudes
toward same-sex marriage?
The purpose of this research is to take a step in that direc-
tion. Toward that end, first we examine mean differences in
Gay et al. 5
attitudes among the four cohorts in attitudes toward same-
sex marriage with and without controls. Second, we regress
attitudes toward same-sex marriage on birth cohort, religios-
ity, spirituality, and control variables for the entire sample.
Third, we analyze separate regression analyses to assess the
relationship between religion and spirituality on attitudes
toward same-sex marriage within each cohort controlling for
sociodemographic variables.
Control Variables
Cohort differences in attitudes toward same-sex marriage
may be related to factors other than religious and spiritual
matters. Recent research demonstrates the importance of
controlling for a variety of sociodemographic variables (e.g.,
Becker, 2012; Cadge et al., 2008; Lannutti & Lachlan, 2007;
Sherkat et al., 2011). This research demonstrates that atti-
tudes toward same-sex marriage vary by marital status, gen-
der, socioeconomic status, geographic residence, and race
and ethnicity to mention a few. As a result, this study incor-
porates control variables in the analysis. Previous research
has demonstrated that women are more supportive of same-
sex sexuality and same-sex marriage. Higher educational
attainment has also been associated with support for same-
sex marriage. Sherkat et al. (2010) reports variations in atti-
tudes by race, region of residence, and community size.
People who live in the south and reside in rural areas are
generally less supportive of same-sex marriage. Baunch
(2012) points to the importance of including African
Americans in an analysis of attitudes toward same-sex mar-
riage and Ellison, Acevedo, and Ramos-Wada (2011) report
the importance of the variation among Hispanics. It is pos-
sible that the inclusion of African American Protestants will
affect the results for other African Americans. It is also likely
that evangelical Protestants will affect the Hispanic effect.
Ellison et al. (2011) point to the strong opposition by evan-
gelical Latinos as contributing to considerable heterogeneity
of attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Given the presence of
race and ethnicity in the literature, dummy variables to rep-
resent African American and Hispanic respondents are incor-
porated in the analysis. In short, drawing from previous
research, we also included a dummy variable for female
respondents, dummy variables for divorced/separated and
never married respondents, a dummy variable for southern
residence, a Likert-type scale item for community size, and a
20-point scale for years of educational attainment.
Analytic Strategy
The analytic strategy used ordinary least squares (OLS) mul-
tiple regression to examine the effects of birth cohort, religi-
osity, spirituality, and sociodemographic variables on attitudes
toward same-sex marriage.Adummy variable for survey year
was included to assess whether survey year affected the anal-
ysis. The inclusion of the survey year dummy variable did not
affect the analysis in any significant way. That is, the inclu-
sion of the variable did not affect the significance level of
any of the independent or control variables.
Method
Like many previous studies of differences in religious, social
and political attitudes, data for this study were taken from the
GSS. The data in these surveys were collected from nation-
wide samples through interviews (Smith et al., 2015). For the
following analysis, only respondents who were interviewed
in 2012 or 2014 were included. The GSS is an appropriate
data set because the data set contains survey items tapping
attitudes toward same-sex marriage, religious and spiritual-
ity items, and a wide range of sociodemographic and back-
ground characteristics of respondents. A total of 2,977
respondents were asked the question concerning same-sex
marriage. Our analysis focused on religious traditions identi-
fied by Steensland et al. (2000), and as a result, not all
respondents in the total sample are included in the analysis.
As we analyzed birth cohorts separately, some groups were
omitted due to small sample sizes. For example, the total
sample only included 40 respondents who identified as
Jewish and 18 who identified as Muslim. Moreover, there
were other religious affiliations that were not part of the
operationalization of religious traditions incorporated in the
analysis due to limited sample size. Furthermore, one of the
difficulties with the GSS data was identifying Asian
Americans and other races and ethnic groups. Of the total
respondents on the race question, 458 were coded "other"
(White and Black are the other two categories). The Hispanic
question for ethnic origin was more direct. Finally, with the
listwise deletion of data for the analysis, the final sample size
is 2,375. See the appendix for the total frequencies for all
variables and categories included in the analysis.
Dependent Variable
The item addressing attitudes toward same-sex marriage was
present in both the 2012 and 2014 GSS. Respondents were
read the following statement: "`Homosexual' couples should
have the right to marry one another." The respondents were
then presented five response categories that ranged from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). All other responses
(i.e., "can't choose" and "no answer") are excluded from the
analysis.
Independent Variables
Birth cohort. Four birth cohorts were identified for the analy-
sis. The Millennial cohort was identified as respondents who
were between 1981 and 1996 (n = 544). Generation X was
identified as respondents who were born between 1965 and
1980 (n = 653). Baby boomers were identified as respon-
dents who were born between 1946 and 1964 (n = 785), and
6 SAGE Open
the Silent Generation were those who were born before 1945
(n = 393). The baby boom cohort served as the reference
category.
Religious affiliation. Religious affiliation was measured using
two questions in the GSS. The first question was, "What is
your religious preference? Is it Protestant, Catholic, Jewish,
some other religion, or no religion?" An additional question
asked whether the response to the first question was Protes-
tant. The question was, "What specific denomination is that,
if any?" These two questions were used to recode religious
affiliation in accordance with the Steensland et al. (2000)
categorical scheme. Hence, not all religious affiliations were
included in the analyses. In addition, to run separate models
for each birth cohort, Jewish respondents were omitted due
to small sample sizes within cohorts. The resulting religious
categories were mainline Protestants, evangelical Protes-
tants, African American Protestants, Catholics, and no reli-
gious preference. Mainline Protestants served as the reference
category.
Attendance at religious services. Public religious participation
was measured by religious attendance. The question was,
"How often do you attend religious services?" The responses
ranged from 0 (never) to 8 (more than once a week). Only
valid responses were used in the analysis. That is, "don't
know" and "no answer" responses were omitted from the
analysis.
Biblical literalism.Literalism was measured through the fol-
lowing question to assess their beliefs concerning the Bible.
"Which of the following statements comes the closest to
describing your feelings about the Bible--`The Bible is the
actual word of God and is to be taken literally'; `The Bible is
the inspired word of God but not everything in it should be
taken literally, word for word'; or `The Bible is an ancient
book of fables, legends, history, and moral precepts recorded
by man?'" Respondents who considered the Bible to be "the
actual word of God and is to be taken literally" were coded
(1) and all others were coded (0) for the analysis.
Prayer. The final variable that addresses subjective religios-
ity was the question concerning prayer. The frequency of
prayer is measured by the following question: "About how
often do you pray?" Responses were coded (1) never, (2) less
than once a week, (3) once a week, (4) several times a week,
(5) once a day, and (6) several times a day. "Don't know" and
"no answer" responses were omitted from the analysis.
SBNR. We use two items from the GSS to operationalize the
SBNR variable and followed the measurement strategy of
previous research (e.g., Chaves, 2011). The first question
addressed subjective spirituality. The question in the GSS is,
"To what extent do you consider yourself a spiritual person?
Are you . . . " The possible responses ranged from 1 (very
spiritual) to 4 (not spiritual at all). Subjective religiosity was
measured by a question tapping the importance of religion in
their everyday lives. The question in the GSS was, "To what
extent do you consider yourself a religious person? Are you
. . . " The possible responses to this question ranged from 1
(very religious) to 4 (not religious at all). "Not applicable,"
"don't know," and "no answer" responses for both of these
questions were omitted from the analysis. An SBNR dummy
variable was created through a combination of the subjective
spirituality and religiousness questions. Individuals who
report being "very spiritual" or "moderately spiritual" on the
spirituality variable and "slightly religious" or "not religious
at all" on the religious variable were coded (1) and represent
the SBNR respondents. All other valid responses were coded
(0). "Don't know" and "no answer" responses were omitted
from the analysis.
Control Variables
Marital status and gender. The marital status question in the
GSS asks respondents if they are currently married, wid-
owed, divorced, separated, or have ever been married. Mari-
tal status was recoded to represent three statuses. Dummy
variables were created to represent respondents who were
married or widowed, divorced or separated, and never mar-
ried. Married respondents served as the reference category in
the analysis. Gender was coded (1) to represent female
respondents and males were coded (0).
Southern residence and community size.A dummy variable
was created for southern residence. The GSS includes an
item that indicates the respondent's area of residence. The
coding followed the U.S. census coding for region. The
resulting codes in the GSS are (1) New England, (2) Middle
Atlantic, (3) East North Central, (4) West North Central, (5)
South Atlantic, (6) East South Central, (7) West South Cen-
tral, (8) Mountain, and (9) Pacific. A dummy variable was
created using the South Atlantic, East South Central, West
South Central codes to represent the South (South = 1, all
others = 0). Urban residence was measured using the Survey
Research Center (SRC) Belt Code (Survey Research Center,
University of Michigan). The variable was recoded so that
the "central city of the 12 largest SMSAs" was coded (6),
"central city of the remainder of the 100 largest SMSAs" was
coded (5), "suburbs of the 12 largest SMSAs" was coded (4),
"suburbs of the remaining 100 largest SMSAs" was coded
(3), "other urban" was coded (2), and "rural" was coded (1).
Educational attainment. The responses for educational attain-
ment in the GSS were in years of school completed and
ranged from 0 to 20. Using years of education as proxy for
educational attainment was relatively straightforward for
years 0 through 12. Years of education after high school may
be more subjective. That is, for many people, it may take
longer than 2 years to obtain an associate degree or longer
Gay et al. 7
than 4 years to get a bachelor's degree and so on. The
assumption is that the number of years beyond high school
reflects the appropriate vocational and academic degrees.
Race and ethnicity.Dummy variables were created for race
and ethnicity by using the questions concerning race and
Hispanic identification. For purposes of this analysis, respon-
dents who identified as White, African American, or His-
panic (regardless of race) were included. White respondents
served as the reference category.
Results
Table 1 displays the means, standard deviations, and propor-
tions for attitudes toward same-sex marriage, the religious
variables, subjective spirituality, and the control variables for
each cohort in the analysis. The table also presents the sam-
ple size for each of the cohorts. Hence, proportions in the
table reflect the number of respondents represented by each
dummy variable. The table exhibits some interesting com-
parisons on the dependent and independent variables across
the four cohorts. First, anANOVArevealed significant cohort
mean differences for attitudes toward same-sex marriage,
F(3, 2371) = 55.01, p < .001. Post hoc comparisons for mean
differences indicated that all were statistically different from
one another (all ps < .001). There was also a pattern of mean
differences.Asteady decrease in level of acceptance was evi-
dent across the four cohorts. The Millennial cohort had the
highest mean score (more likely to agree that same-sex cou-
ples should be allowed to marry) and the Silent Generation
had the lowest.
Second, the table shows both religious affiliation category
differences and similarities. The proportion of each cohort
who was Catholic was relatively constant. The same was
the case for African American Protestants. The cohort differ-
ences were among no preference respondents, evangelical
Protestants, and mainline Protestants. Table 1 shows that the
proportion of no religious preference respondents was highest
among the Millennial cohort and lowest among the Silent
Generation. This pattern was reversed for both evangelical and
mainline Protestants. The Millennials had a lower proportion
of these two religious categories than the older cohorts.
Third, the Millennial cohort had the lowest mean and pro-
portion scores for the remaining three religiosity variables
(i.e., attendance, Biblical literalism, and frequency of prayer).
The Silent Generation had the highest mean for attendance at
religious services (M = 4.08, SD = 2.95) highest proportion
of Biblical literalist (.35), and the highest mean for the fre-
quency of prayer (M = 4.55, SD = 1.55). Even though
research shows that attendance has a tendency to increase

with age regardless of birth cohort (Newport, 2012), others
(Miller & Nakamura, 1996) argue that older cohorts have
attended religious services more frequently across the life
course. In addition, the Millennial cohort attends religious
services less than the baby boom cohort did at the same age.
Bengtson et al. (2013) contend that the oldest birth cohort in
this study is the most religious among the cohorts identified,
and the results in Table 1 are consistent with their research.
We also examined mean differences across religious affil-
iation categories for the total sample. An ANOVA revealed
significant religious affiliation mean differences for attitudes
toward same-sex marriage, F(4, 2371) = 81.23, p < .001.
With one exception, all post hoc mean comparisons were sta-
tistically significant (p < .001). The lone exception was the
difference between mainline Protestants and African
American Protestants. Hence, these two religious categories
appear to be more similar than dissimilar in their attitudes
toward same-sex marriage. This is important to note because
mainline Protestants represent the reference group for all
regression models in Tables 2 and 3.
The subsequent analyses addressed the relative impact of
religiosity, spirituality, and sociodemographic variables on
attitudes toward same-sex marriage for the full sample (Table
2) and for each cohort (Table 3). Table 2 displays two models
where attitudes toward same-sex marriage were regressed on
three dummy variables for cohort (Model I) and on the cohort
dummy variables, religious and spirituality independent
variables, and controls (Model II). The first model included
dummy variables for three of the birth cohorts and accounted
for 6.5% of the variation in attitudes toward same-sex atti-
tudes, F(3, 2371) = 54.69, p < .001. Model 1 shows the
regression coefficients for the Millennial cohort, Generation
X, and the Silent Generation. The Baby Boom cohort was the
reference group for both models. The coefficients represent
mean differences (Model I) and adjusted mean differences
(Model II) between the three dummy variables representing
the Millennials, Generation X, and the Silent Generation and
the Baby Boom reference cohort. Model I shows that the
Millennials (b = .710, p < .01) and Generation X (b = .319,
p < .01) had higher scores than the Baby Boomers on the
attitudes toward same-sex marriage scale. In contrast, the
Silent Generation had a lower score (b = -.451, p < .01) than
the Baby Boomers. The coefficients in Model II control for
religious and spirituality independent variables and the
sociodemographic control variables. The model explained
32.4% of the variation in attitudes toward same-sex marriage,
F(20, 2354) = 56.33, p < .001. The results for the birth cohort
dummy variables mirrored the results without controls. That
is, cohort differences remained when religious, spirituality,
and control variables were included in the full model.
Table 2 also displays the results for the religious and spiritu-
ality variables for the total sample. Model II shows that evan-
gelicalProtestantsweresignificantlylesssupportiveofsame-sex
marriage than mainline Protestants (b = -.260, p < .01). Catholic
respondents (b = .222, p < .01) and no preference respondents
(b = .197, p < .05) were more supportive than the comparison
category. African American Protestants were not signifi-
cantly different from mainline Protestants. Table 2 shows
that as attendance at religious services increased, support for
same-sex marriage decreased. This is also the case for fre-
quency of prayer. Respondents who believe in the literal
interpretation of the Bible were less supportive of same-sex
marriage than those who do not hold those beliefs. The final
independent variable in Model II represents the SBNR
respondents. Those who were SBNR had a higher score on
the attitudes toward same-sex marriage scale than all others.
This is consistent with previous research on the relationship
between subjective spirituality and attitudes toward same-
sex relations (Barringer et al., 2013).
The sociodemographic control variables showed a pattern
that is generally consistent with the extant literature. Females
were more supportive than males, never married respondents
were more supportive that married respondents, and south-
erners were less supportive than respondents in other parts of
the country. In addition, as community size increased, so did
support for same-sex marriage, and higher educational
attainment predicted greater support. The variable represent-
ing African American respondents was not statistically sig-
nificant and neither was the variable representing Hispanic
respondents. Thus, the analysis of the full sample provided a
baseline for cohort differences, the impact of religiosity and
spirituality, and other determinants of attitudes toward same-
sex marriage. All but one of the cohort differences remained
when controls were included. We extend the existing litera-
ture on cohort and religiosity differences by analyzing each
cohort independently.
Table 3 displays the results of the regression analysis for
each cohort. That is, separate regression analyses were run for
Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers, and the Silent
Generation. These regression analyses afforded the opportu-
nity to examine the unique determinants of attitudes toward
same-sex marriage by cohort. Each model includes the reli-
gious, spirituality, and control variables. The first model shows
the coefficients for the Millennial cohort and accounted for
25.4% of the variation, F(17, 526) = 10.52, p < .001. The anal-
ysis for Millennials shows that Catholics (b = .391, p < .01),
African American Protestants (b = .552, p < .01), and no pref-
erence respondents (b = .429, p < .01) were more supportive of
same-sex marriage than mainline Protestants. While other
research points to some variation within religious tradition, this
research also points to differences between religious traditions
among young adults even when control variables are included
in the models (Walls et al., 2014). Interestingly, there was no
significant difference between evangelical Protestants and
mainline Protestants. Like the model for the full sample in
Table 2, respondents who believe in the literal interpretation of
the Bible were less supportive. In addition, as the frequency of
prayer increased, support for same-sex marriage decreased. In
contrast to other cohorts, attendance at religious services had
noeffect on attitudes toward same-sex marriage for Millennial
Gay et al. 9
respondents. SBNR respondents also showed no significant
difference.
In the Generation X model of Table 3, we see a different
pattern of results. This model accounts for 30.6% of the varia-
tion in attitudes, F(17, 635) = 16.49, p < .001. Evangelical
Protestants were significantly less supportive than their main-
line Protestant counterparts (b = -.422, p < .01) while African
American Protestants and no religious preference respon-
dents showed no significant differences. Catholic respondents
were marginally significant (b = .266, p < .10). This pattern
was very close to the reverse of the pattern found for the
Millennial cohort. Like the Millennial cohort, as attendance at
religious services increased, support for same-sex marriage
decreased. The effects of the belief in the literal interpretation
of the Bible and the frequency of prayer were consistent with
the Millennial cohort and the analysis of the full sample.
However, unlike the Millennial cohort, respondents identified
as SBNR were more supportive of same-sex marriage than
the reference category (b = .277, p < .01).
The third model in Table 3 presents the results for the
Baby Boom cohort and accounts for 30.9% of the variation
in attitudes toward same-sex marriage, F(17, 767) = 20.15, p
< .001. Unlike the other cohorts, there were no religious
affiliation differences. Like Generation X, as attendance at
religious services increased, support for same-sex marriage
decreased, and those who believe in the literal interpretation
of the Bible were less supportive of same-sex marriage.
Frequency of prayer was not statistically significant.
However, like Generation X and unlike the Millennial cohort,
Baby Boomers who were identified as SBNR showed more
support for same-sex marriage (b = .393, p < .01).
The last model in Table 3 displays the results for the Silent
Generation and accounts for 31.8% of the variation in atti-
tudes toward same-sex marriage, F(17, 375) = 10.29, p <

.001. This cohort was the least supportive of all cohorts in
general. The model for the Silent Generation shows that
evangelical Protestants were significantly less supportive
than the reference category (b = -.507, p < .01) and no reli-
gious preference respondents were significantly more sup-
portive of same-sex marriage (b = .625, p < .01). Catholics
and African American Protestants showed no significant dif-
ferences from the mainline Protestant reference category.
There were only two religious or spiritual variables in the
model that were significant. Attendance at religious services
had a marginally significant negative effect (b = -.048, p <
.10). And respondents who believe in a literal interpretation
of the Bible were less supportive of same-sex marriages (b =
-.189, p < .01). There was no significant effect for respon-
dents who were identified as SBNR.
Among the control variables, female respondents were
consistently more supportive than males across all cohorts.
This is also the case for educational attainment. For all
cohorts, as educational attainment increased, so do attitudes
toward same-sex marriage. There was no consistent pattern
for the other control variables. The effect of southern resi-
dence was found among Baby Boomers but not among other
cohorts. This finding raises some interesting questions con-
cerning southern residence.
Discussion
Limitations
First, our study uses a cross-sectional design, and we are
somewhat limited as a result. We are unable to examine
cohorts when they were at the same age (e.g., Millennials
and Baby Boomers when they were both in their twenties),
we could not follow a cohort over time, and the data are sim-
ply not available to assess period or time of measurement
effects. Therefore, we could not conduct a thorough Age/
Period/Cohort research design. Nevertheless, the GSS data
do afford the opportunity to assess the relationship between

religiosity and spirituality and attitudes toward same-sex
marriage. Issues related to same-sex marriage are very
important at this particular time in American society, and we
are able to point to several interesting patterns or trends. We
were able to examine the determinants of attitudes toward
same-sex marriage within cohorts and compare these effects
using national data.
Second,thisstudywasalsolimitedtoProtestants,Catholics,
and no religious preference respondents. This is due to small
sample sizes of other religious categories and the analytic
strategy to examine each cohort separately for comparisons.
The focus was to examine the determinants of attitudes toward
same-sex marriage for each cohort.As a result, Jewish respon-
dents, Muslim respondents, and other religious respondents
did not have a large enough sample size to be included in the
analysis. And third, the analysis is limited to White respon-
dents, African American respondents, and Hispanic respon-
dents. Hence, a number of racial and ethnic groups are not part
of the analysis. In addition, we were not able to further exam-
ine the variation among Latinos identified by Ellison et al.
(2011). Future research should examine comparisons using
more diverse data.
Conclusion
This study shows several interesting patterns. First, among
the Millennial cohort, respondents who identify with evan-
gelical Protestant denominations show no significant differ-
ences from their mainline Protestant counterparts. The bulk
of the social scientific literature concludes that White evan-
gelical Protestants are the least likely set of denominations
to support same-sex marriage. However, this is not the case
for the Millennial cohort. They may think of same-sex mar-
riage in different ways than their older cohorts. Second,
attendance at religious services has no effect on Millennials'
attitudes. This runs counter to the extant literature for the
general population (Sherkat et al., 2011). Attendance at reli-
gious services has shown a consistent negative relationship
with attitudes toward same-sex relations. That is, increased
attendance has been associated with less support for same-
sex marriage. However, recent research (Walls et al., 2014)
found no effect for attendance among a sample of college
students when other controls were included in the models.
Third, among Millennials, African American Protestants are
more likely to support same-sex marriage than their pre-
dominantly White, mainline Protestant counterparts. This
runs counter to other cohorts where African American
Protestants and mainline Protestants are in line with one
another. Fourth, while SBNR respondents are more support-
ive of same-sex marriage for Generation X and the Baby
Boomers, this is not the case for the Millennial cohort.
If these patterns persist for the Millennial cohort, some
aspects of the relationship between religiosity, spirituality,
and attitudes toward same-sex marriage are likely to change
in the general population.
These results call for additional research on the relation-
ship between religiosity, spirituality, and attitudes toward
same-sex marriage for the Millennial birth cohort and
Generation X. A smaller percentage of the Millennial cohort
identifies as evangelical, but 14% of the sample does express
an evangelical religious preference. The results suggest that
younger evangelical respondents are more supportive of
same-sex marriage than their older counterparts. Perhaps the
most striking result is that attendance at religious services
has no effect on same-sex attitudes for Millennials.Affiliation
and participation are components of institutional effects that
are simply not present for this younger cohort. Therefore,
going back to "church" later in the life course is not likely to
have the same effect as it may have had for the Baby Boom
cohort (Newport, 2012).
The subjective aspects of religiosity in the analysis are
consistent with previous research. Those who believe in the
literal interpretation of the Bible are less supportive of
same-sex marriage. The relationship between the literal
interpretation of the Bible and attitudes toward same-sex
marriage is consistent across all four cohorts. The other sub-
jective component of religiosity is the frequency of prayer.
Prayer occurs inside and outside the religious institution.
For Millennials and Generation X, as the frequency of
prayer increases, support for same-sex marriage decreases.
Future research should examine this relationship in more
detail.
All indications are that there are changes in the American
religious landscape. Younger adults in general are less reli-
gious than older adults (Jones et al., 2014; Taylor, 2014).
However, our conclusions concerning the Millennial evan-
gelical Protestants are not based on them being less religious.
Even though the percentage may be lower than other cohorts,
their attitudes do not differ from the mainline Protestants. The
results show this is also the case for attendance at religious
services. Therefore, our results show a differential impact of
religiosity and spirituality on attitudes toward same-sex mar-
riage for the Millennial cohort. As the Millennial cohort and
Generation X age, social scientific research is needed to
assess the extent to which these younger age cohorts exhibit
changes in religiosity, spirituality, and attitudes toward same-
sex marriage. These two cohorts are the most likely to experi-
ence the changes of same-sex marriage in our society. Future
research can address a wide range of issues now that law pro-
tects fairness and equality in marriage.
