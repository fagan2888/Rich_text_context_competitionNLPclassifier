Abstract
We begin this article with a close look at some contemporary pictures of sexual life in
the Muslim world that have been painted in certain sections of the Western media,
asking how and why these pictures matter. Across a range of mainstream print media
from the New York Times to the Daily Mail, and across reported events from several
countries, can be found pictures of `sexual misery'. These `frame' Muslim men as
tyrannical, Muslim women as downtrodden or exploited, and the wider world of
Islam as culpable. Crucially, this is not the whole story. We then consider how these
negative representations are being challenged and how they can be challenged further.
In doing so, we will not simply set pictures of sexual misery against their binary
opposites, namely pictures abounding in the promise of sexual happiness. Instead, we
search for a more complex picture, one that unsettles stereotypes about the sexual

life writing and creative non-fiction of Shelina Zahra Janmohamed and the fiction of
Ayisha Malik and Amjeed Kabil. We read this long-form work critically, attending to
manifest advances in depictions of the relationships of Muslim-identified individuals over
the last decade or so, while also remaining alert to lacunae and limitations in the
individual representations. More broadly, we hope to signal our intention to avoid
both Islamophobia and Islamophilia in scrutinising literary texts.

Introduction
Writing for the New York Times in February 2016, the French-Algerian writer
Kamel Daoud painted a picture of `one of the great miseries plaguing' Arab
nations and indeed the Muslim world in general: `its sick relationship with
women' (2016b: n.p.). Daoud consequently located a series of sexual assaults
within an expansive sexual ecology encompassing cultural, ethnic, national and
religious groups, which he took to include Arabs, North Africans, refugees and,
above all, Muslims. The sexual assaults examined in Daoud's article had taken
place in the German cities of Cologne, Hamburg and Stuttgart a month earlier.
This article published in the New York Times, like many other reports and features
disseminated across a number of different media platforms including newspapers
and websites, communicated a seemingly coherent picture which appeared to
explain the assaults with ease. It portrayed Muslim men as tyrannical, Muslim
women as downtrodden or exploited, and the wider world of Islam as culpable (see
also Morey and Yaqin, 2011). Daoud linked the actions of a small number of
individuals to wider cultural and religious groups, beginning with the million or
so refugees who had recently been granted asylum in Germany and extending to
the wider Arab world, North African and Middle Eastern peoples and cultures, as
well as to the Islamic world more broadly.
The counterpoint to the `miserable' Muslims identified in the New York Times
article was, of course, an equally stereotypical West. Daoud implicitly character-
ised the West as a culture and a people upholding values pertaining to gender
equality and sexual harmony. In the context of powerful Orientalist myths
about the Arab and Muslim world as a hotbed of repressed sexuality ­ which
Daoud admittedly acknowledged ­ it was damaging that his article also employed
the diction of contagion. It described the intersecting groups of Muslims and
Arabs as sexually dangerous, their `sick relationship with women' threatening
the `healthy' European body politic.1 According to Daoud, a disease ­ implied
2 Ethnicities 0(0)
as sexual in nature ­ is `spreading to [Western] lands'. This `pathology' is also
broadening from a mental to a physical register, where its expressions range from
hymen reconstruction surgery to the actions of suicide bombers (2016b: n.p.). It
should not escape the reader's notice that, both according to Daoud and amongst
some of the Islamic religious authorities he decries, an emphasis on what is deemed
`healthy' and wholesome and what is labelled as `sick' forms an ideological sub-
stratum for controlling what women do with their bodies and with whom. Small
wonder that feminists and queer theorists such as Sara Ahmed and Ann
Cvetkovich have called for the `depathologization' (Cvetkovich, 2012: 5) of nega-
tive affects such as misery. These scholars have drawn attention to various man-
ifestations of unhappiness as racialised categories associated with `melancholy
migrants' (Sara Ahmed, 2010a: 121­159). They posit that, in the context of
(neo-)colonialism, such emotions are `not so much a medical or biochemical dys-
function as a very rational response to global conditions' (Cvetkovich, 2012: 5).
Accordingly, these theorists call for a recalibration of widespread, and potentially
damaging, assumptions that happiness is automatically equated with the reductive
concept of `good' and misery is diametrically opposed as `bad'.
Returning to Daoud, his argumentational thrust is remarkably familiar. Indeed,
this latest iteration of counterproductive stereotypes and sometimes wilful confu-
sions can be traced back through European colonial histories. However, this mor-
alistic discourse of difference has shifted and expanded over time, mapping onto
contemporary developments and events. Kamel Daoud's New York Times article
reworked an original piece ­ `Cologne, lieu de fantasmes' (2016a) ­ which the
French newspaper Le Monde printed on 31 January 2016. These two articles
were simply the latest instalments from a subgenre of journalism in which current
events with broadly sexual content were, and indeed are, reported on and inter-
preted against a common backdrop or, as Edward Said put it (2003/1978), an
imaginative geography. A jumbled picture of Arab and Islamic worlds is sketched
on this backdrop, centring on North Africa and the Middle East and spilling over
into any place where Arab and/or Muslim men come into contact with others.
Such an imaginative geography exists primarily in the European mind, but it is
mapped onto real people and places, forming the lens through which events are
interpreted. This is a metaphorical place of misery, where tyrannical men objectify
and exploit women and girls, both within and outside their own communities.
To understand this emphasis upon misery, it helps to focus more closely on Sara
Ahmed, whose monograph The Promise of Happiness exposes an emotional apart-
heid in which unhappiness (or, in our case, misery) is kept quarantined as far away
from happiness as possible:
[T]he very idea of contagion can be evoked in the self-regulation of feeling worlds.
You might refuse proximity to somebody out of fear that you will be infected by
unhappiness, or you might seek proximity to somebody out of hope that you will be
infected by happiness. An affective geography of happiness takes shape. Unhappiness
is pushed to the margins, which means certain bodies are pushed to the margins, in
Chambers et al. 3
order that the unhappiness that is assumed to reside within these bodies does not
threaten the happiness that has been given. (2010a: 97­98)
Ahmed communicates that the much-vaunted affect of happiness, which is usually
assumed to be within every individual's grasp, is intimately connected to privilege.
Denying the significance of `the hap of what happens' (2010a: 31, 33, 41) means
that `[f]eelings can get stuck to certain bodies' (2010a: 69). Thus, happiness and
misery map onto `good' and `bad' Muslims respectively, and in turn, as we will
argue, `good' and `bad' Muslims map onto Islamophilia and Islamophobia.
At stake in Daoud's article, as in several other media reports and commentaries
on the sexual assaults in Germany, is the creation of a composite category of the
sexually rapacious refugee, Arab and/or Muslim man. As previously mentioned,
the actions of relatively few individuals are axiomatically identified with this
increasingly capacious and allegedly predatory group. Each of the subcategories
matters, but one stands out as the usual suspect in this burgeoning genre of current
affairs reporting: the Muslim man. In response to the New York Times article, a
group of academics, including David Theo Goldberg, Ghassan Hage and Laleh
Khalili, published an open letter also in Le Monde on 11 February protesting
Daoud's `psychologization' of `more than a billion individuals' from Muslim back-
grounds (Goldberg et al., 2016: n.p.).
Muslim studies tend to be dominated by social science disciplines, including
sociology, human geography, religious studies and criminology. Breaking new
ground, the AHRC-funded Storying Relationships research project from which
this article stems focuses on the concomitant importance of arts and humanities
scholarship in the field of Muslim studies. By bridging the social sciences and
literary or cultural studies approaches and aiming to transcend the pernicious
dichotomies of good Muslim and bad Muslim or Islamophilia and
Islamophobia, our research seeks to find a middle ground between polarised posi-
tions. This is especially salient in light of the recent rise of extremism ­ Islamist,
Hindutva and white supremacist. In Tariq Ali's, 2002 book, The Clash of
Fundamentalisms, he positions American imperialism as the most dangerous `fun-
damentalism' of our contemporary moment. More recently, in Age of Anger
(2017), Pankaj Mishra reveals that ISIS, white supremacy and Hindu fundamen-
talism have a surprising amount in common. Like Ali, Mishra categorises blind
adherence to global capital as a type of fanaticism (2017: 37, 44, 78, 351). Keeping
in mind both the rise of violent extremism accreting to Islam and the resurgence of
the far right, we seek to unsettle hostility towards, as well as uncritical praise of,
Muslims through detailed analysis of literary texts. The contrasting pictures of the
`sexual misery' of Muslims on the one hand and `happy British Muslims' on the
other are unpicked in this article, which takes creative non-fiction and novels as
more illuminating points of reference than media representations. While this article
begins with an in-depth discussion of descriptions of Muslim men, the article then
moves on to examine the portrayal of Muslim women and to a particularly female-
associated literary genre ­ namely, chick lit. Finally, we consider the stories about
4 Ethnicities 0(0)
Muslim sexualities that are not yet in circulation. We ask how these stories could
be produced, circulated and consumed, and, whether through their telling and
sharing, sexual relationships could be reimagined.
Mainstream depictions of Muslim sexualities
Before examining the work of a number of Muslim-identified writers who relate
stories about relationships and sexualities within their communities ­ thereby
bringing hitherto unheard stories and experiences to wider audiences ­ it is neces-
sary to develop a clearer picture of what they are writing against, whether explicitly
or implicitly. As outlined above, journalists have adumbrated an expansive sexual
ecology of Islamic sexualities through reference to stereotypes and caricatures.
This article is concerned with the form that these stereotypes currently take in
the UK, as well as with Muslim writers' responses to such vignettes. Close reading
allows us to differentiate a series of themes that go beyond the inflammatory
headlines equating sexual misery with Muslim men. We argue that literature by
Muslim-identified writers fleshes out conventional mediations of this `misery'.
First, it is essential to highlight some of the specific ways in which Muslim
sexualities have been portrayed in mainstream discourse in the context of
Britain. An important and indicative example of this mainstream discourse, in
the form of media and political commentary, is provided through consideration
of Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) and Child Sexual Abuse (CSA). CSE/A has
been widespread throughout the UK, but has been especially and alarmingly
prominent in a number of post-industrial, socially and economically deprived
parts of the Midlands, Lancashire, Yorkshire and more recently Tyne and
Wear. Geographically, there is an overlap between areas affected by CSE/A and
those with substantial populations of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME)
groups,2 notably those with Pakistani Muslim heritage.
Dominating prevailing discussions of CSE/A is a narrative in which commen-
tators claim to have discovered and transgressed a purposeful and cowardly silence
maintained by liberals and those belonging to associated professional classes in
their refusal to blame Pakistani, Muslim or Asian men and their wider communi-
ties for acts of sexual exploitation and abuse. Breaking this taboo ­ acknowledging
what the (London) Times reporter Andrew Norfolk (2012a) has called the `ele-
phant in the room' ­ these commentators go to some lengths to explain precisely
how and why the men in these targeted minority groups are culpable. Today, their
interventions have become sufficiently commonplace that any claims about ele-
phants in rooms are no longer tenable. Indeed, these claims have reached beyond
their most obvious home ­ right-wing and populist British print newspapers such
as the Times and Daily Mail ­ to permeate more liberal-identified voices, including
that of the former New Labour Home Secretary and Blackburn MP Jack Straw.
This observation resonates with Joseph Massad's argument that Islamophobia and
liberalism are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, he argues, they are mutually
Chambers et al. 5
constitutive (Massad, 2015; see also Phillips, 2016). Commenting on the conviction
of two rapists in 2011, Straw asserted:
We need to get the Pakistani community to think much more clearly about why this is
going on [. . .] These young men are in a western society; they act like any other young
men, they're fizzing and popping with testosterone, they want some outlet for that,
but Pakistani heritage girls are off-limits and they are expected to marry a Pakistani
girl from Pakistan, typically. (BBC, 2011: n.p.; see also Batty, 2011)
Straw's confidently confrontational tone has been echoed and apparently vindi-
cated more recently by those in the professional classes and others in positions of
power and authority. This is evidenced in Alexis Jay's (2014) report, which inves-
tigated the circumstances surrounding the sexual abuse of at least 1400 children in
Rotherham between 1997 and 2013 (see Tufail, 2015), and the Casey Review,
which examined the alleged failures of social integration in the UK. These discus-
sions, which have clearly become orthodox wisdom and therefore no longer taboo,
demand a closer look.
The dominant, and arguably hegemonic, discourse on Muslim sexualities is
inconsistent in its use of ethnic, racial and religious categories and terms, but its
primary concern ultimately lies with Muslims. In an op-ed on the Rotherham child
abuse, Norfolk accused `Muslim men, mostly of Pakistani origin' of being the
perpetrators (Norfolk, 2012a: 11); this demonstrates a widespread tendency to
slip between these and related terms, effectively using them as synonyms. In anoth-
er article, entitled `Role of Asian Gangs is Played Down by Report on Thousands
of Child Victims', Norfolk quotes Michael Gove, the Conservative Member of
Parliament, and now Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs and jingoistic Brexiteer, as complaining about the establishment's silence
on `Asian abusers' (Norfolk, 2012b: 12). The media's far too regular (and unex-
amined) slippage between categories, including Muslim, Pakistani and Asian, ref-
ugee and immigrant, is open to interpretation. It may be argued that journalists, in
seeking to vary their language, are merely reaching for synonyms. Equally, it may
be that their muddled reportage betrays ignorance. Whatever the case, categories
are conflated, particular terms are used as surrogates for others, and out of this
confusing picture the category of the Muslim floats to the surface. In the context of
post-7/7 British media reportage on Muslims, Maria Sobolewska and Sundas Ali
argue that the coverage `follow[s] a pre-existing media narrative' (2015: 677), which
may, in turn, be located within a much larger discursive system ­ namely, that of
sexualised Orientalism (Phillips, 2016).
Sexualised Orientalism, though a historically coherent and repetitive narrative,
is also marked by local variations and apparent contradictions. Sexualised
Orientalist figures ­ of which Muslim men are prime examples ­ are in some
cases depicted as sensuous and hypersexualised, in others as sexually repressed,
and in certain cases as embodying both of these contradictory tendencies at once
(Phillips, 2016). Straw's description of British Muslim men, for example, refers to
6 Ethnicities 0(0)
young men `fizzing and popping with testosterone'. Yet it simultaneously alludes to
a culture that denies these men a healthy sexual `outlet', allegedly driving them to
take action in extreme ways, such as through the sexual exploitation of children. In
his assertions about the closed sexual ecologies of British Pakistani Muslims, Straw
also dismissed the women in those communities, constructing them as sexually
unavailable, repressed figures, devoid of sexual desire and experience.
Although this damaging and incorrect image of Muslim sexualities is becoming
increasingly common and widespread, the media and various individuals respon-
sible for creating and sustaining this story have not been entirely successful in
eradicating other perspectives. The simplistic picture of Muslim sexual aggressors
and white victims has been undercut, for example, by Manveen Rana's report for
the BBC's File on 4 radio documentary series (2014: n.p.). In this programme
Rana exposed the fact that Asian women were victims in Rotherham too, but
that their voices have been silenced. Similarly, the Guardian ran an article by
Deputy Children's Commissioner Sue Berelowitz, who unequivocally stated that
CSE/A is `not a problem within one particular faith or ethnic group' (Berelowitz,
2012b: n.p.). Berelowitz argued that the ethnicities of abusers and victims alike
mirrored those of the communities in which these events took place ­ with a
majority of abusers, in fact, being white.
The BBC and Guardian's critical and sympathetic coverage illustrates that the
emergent narrative of CSE/A as a Muslim problem is contested. Furthermore, this
is not simply a matter of mainstream voices (of non-Muslims and white people)
being pitted against those of Muslims, even though this is part of the story. And,
while some non-Muslims are searching for a gradated approach, a number of
Muslim-identified commentators are taking an opposing stance. Yasmin Alibhai-
Brown, identifying herself as Muslim, took issue with Berelowitz (2012a), whom
she accused of failing to name and blame those who were disproportionately
responsible for CSE/A: Muslim men of Asian, specifically Pakistani, heritage.
Alibhai-Brown alleged that this official was held back by political correctness
and the fear of being labelled `racist'. In keeping with the shrill and combative
tone of the right-wing British tabloid newspaper for which she was writing,
Alibhai-Brown dramatised and sensationalised. `Circles of sexual hell for young
girls are run by gangs of Muslim men (most of Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage)
who mostly prey on white girls', she claimed (2012: n.p.). This journalistic extrap-
olation, in which localised events are linked to a bigger picture and Muslims are
pinpointed as blameworthy, is often implicit; however, there are also instances
where this is unequivocally spelt out for the reader. The New York Times' reporter
Emma-Kate Symons drew simplistic parallels between the New Year assaults in
Cologne and those that took place in Rotherham. Symons claimed that white girls
in the northern English town were `targeted ethnically by Pakistani gangs', and
that both Rotherham and Cologne formed part of a wider `sexual jihad' (2016: n.
p.). This phrase seems to have been borrowed from India, where a right-wing
Hindutva urban myth, spread through the social media platform WhatsApp, has
whipped up majoritarian anger over allegations about Hindu women being
Chambers et al. 7
abducted by Muslim men, forcibly converted to Islam, coerced into marriage and
then held captive by their `husbands' (see Sethi, 2015: 33­37). The coinage of
`sexual jihad' may also be a reaction to Amina Wadud's 2006 publication of an
urgent, radical book entitled Inside the Gender Jihad: Women's Reform of Islam
(notably, Wadud is an African-American academic and in 2005 became the first
woman to lead a New York City mosque congregation in prayer). More generally,
though, the idea of sexual jihad revisits and renews a wider discourse in which
Muslim men are portrayed as sexual tyrants and, conversely, sexual tyrants are
portrayed above all as Muslims.
The issue of CSE/A is not just explored with journalistic relish, as evidenced by
its treatment in Nadeem Aslam's acclaimed anti-clerical novel, Maps for Lost
Lovers. From his controversial opening line on the subject ­ `[s]emen was found
on the mosque floor late last evening' (2004: 234) ­ onwards,3 Aslam provides
details of the sexual abuse of a child by a Muslim preacher. This cleric has been
employed in a northern English mosque despite his known history of assaults on
children, and the novel traces the religious community's cover-up of this abuse.
It is important to examine this example in the context of Aslam's manifest aesthetic
qualities, as well as his problematic overloading of religious maltreatment in the
novel. Maps for Lost Lovers' primary plotline centres on the `honour' killing of an
unmarried British Pakistani couple who live together, but subsidiary cruelties
include the violent exorcism of djinns, women's lack of rights under Islamic
divorce and the pernicious effects of gender segregation.
These descriptions, some of them caricatures and all of them freighted with
negativity, touch on many of the themes that various Muslim-identified and
non-Muslim writers, from journalists to novelists, have written against. We now
turn to some of the counter-hegemonic representations that these writers have
produced.
Happier pictures of Muslim sexualities
Responding to the pervasive pictures of misery evaluated above, more positive
perspectives on Muslim sexualities are gaining traction and attention. To begin
with the mainstream media, the Herald Scotland (Duffy, 2014: n.p.), BBC (2003: n.
p.) and Guardian (Samira Ahmed, 2013: n.p.) have run stories about the popularity
of speed dating and modern matchmaking experiences in Muslim communities.
The very act of publishing these stories serves to establish Muslims as rounded
human beings who engage in diverse dating and relationship norms, thus challeng-
ing commonplace perceptions of Muslim relationship practices. Within such
reportage, young British Muslim men and women openly break down stereotypes
of the traditional Muslim and instead reveal a glimpse of the real-life experiences
of the everyday Muslim who could easily be the assumed white, secular reader's
Muslim neighbour, colleague or friend. For example, in the Guardian article `Single
Muslim Women on Dating: "I Don't Want to Be a Submissive Wife"', journalist
Samira Ahmed focused in particular on Asma, who described several dating horror
8 Ethnicities 0(0)
stories with wry humour and open-mindedness (Samira Ahmed, 2013: n.p.).
Similarly, in 2015, left-leaning tabloid the Mirror published an article `"Tinder
for Muslims" Targets Religious Singletons who Are Sick of Shallow Hook-up
Services'. In it, Jasper Hamill (2015) interviewed Shahzad Younas, the 30-year-
old founder of halal dating app Muzmatch, who drew attention to his female-
focused algorithms and the app's emphasis on encouraging marriage matches
rather than dick pics. In a longer journalistic investigation into the `Islamic
Tinder' phenomenon, Triska Hamid (2017) spoke to the users (rather than the
CEOs, as had previously been the norm) of dating apps such as Muzmatch,
Minder and Salaam Swipe. In this article, three consumers ­ Amira, Noura and
Ayesha (respectively a lawyer, a civil servant and an entrepreneur) ­ bemoan the
`quality' of men to be found online and in the `real world', stating that their high-
powered jobs make them `intimidating' to single men of their own age (Hamid,
2017: 84). As single Muslim women looking for love, Asma, Amira, Noura and
Ayesha highlight through their stories those challenges faced by ordinary Muslim
women. These challenges often turn out to be not so different from those of any
other single woman looking for love, irrespective of religion or culture.
Working alongside, and sometimes within, the mainstream media, a new wave
of young Muslims are also finding ways to present their friends, families and
communities as confident, contented people who enjoy life and engage in well-
rounded relationships. For example, in 2014, a YouTube video entitled `Happy
British Muslims' was disseminated by an incognito group of British Muslims
known as Honesty Policy as a tribute to African American singer-songwriter
Pharrell Williams. `Happy British Muslims' quickly went viral as a joyous antidote
to the dominant narrative of `sick' Muslim sexuality. At the time of writing, the
video has garnered 2,378,323 views and many inches of newsprint. It features men,
women and children from various ethnic groups dancing, even body popping, to
Williams' hit song `Happy'. Comprising an emblematic slice of contemporary
Muslim society, some of the women featured are muhajabah while others are
not. Similarly, the everyday people highlighted in the video wear everything
from Guy Fawkes masks to abayas, shalwar kameez to jeans and children's
fancy dress costumes. It is the ordinariness of the people depicted in the video
together with the upbeat soundtrack that is both affecting and effective.
Identifiably British settings, such as skateboard parks, suburban living rooms,
a greasy spoon cafe, council estates, dreaming spires and a mosque form the
backdrop to the video.
Two record-scratch moments briefly pierce the exuberant optimism, providing
hints of a gloomier experience. Firstly, Cambridge scholar Sheikh Abdal-Hakim
Murad, also known by his birth name of Tim Winter and renowned for his serious
demeanour, stares impassively at the camera before holding up an explanatory
`I'm happy' sign (Honesty, 2014: n.p.). Later in the YouTube clip, another dis-
comforting moment arises and then quickly passes when two Muslim men appear
to square up to each other, but soon stand down and break into jiving together to
Williams' catchy vocals. There was limited criticism of the video as haram, and this
Chambers et al. 9
judgement that it was not permissible for believing Muslims possessed a sexual
angle, because music and dancing are seen as gateways to impropriety. However,
the primary critic ­ an online Muslim news source the Shaam Post ­ quickly
removed its article stating that Sheikh Murad had distanced himself from the
video, when Murad turned around and contradicted this stance by speaking to
the Independent in favour of Honesty Policy's activism (Merrill, 2014: n.p.). Some
online commenters were less circumspect, however, with one, Mohammad
Ghasemi, expressing his strong distaste for the free interaction between the male
and female dancers, as well as the expressions of sexuality present in the video
when he remarked: `It is Haram [against Islam] for women to dance in front of
men. You are not real muslims. This video is vomiting [sic]'. At the other end of the
political spectrum, another commenter (A Freeman) succinctly demonstrated the
prevalent `everyday racism' Muslims regularly encounter when (s)he wrote as
follows: `There are NO "British Muslims" ­ only alien invaders and colonists
OR native convert traitors to their nation and heritage. Their nation is Islam,
not Britain, and their British passport is simply a flag of convenience' (Honesty,
2014: comments section, 5 January 2017). Freeman's rather incoherent comment
seems to accuse all Muslims of being `enemies within' the British nation-state,
whose loyalties reside outside Britain with the Ummah or global community of
Muslims. Honesty Policy's presentation of British Muslims' performance of hap-
piness was innovative in that it cut across and contradicted contemporary por-
trayals of British Muslims as dour, sexually repressed and `alien' to perceived
Western contemporary lifestyles.
However, there is an adversarial quality to the stories we have discussed so far.
Stereotypes of miserable Muslims, personified in the figure of the tyrannical
Muslim man who preys on white girls and women while his wife, daughters and
sisters fester at home behind closed doors, are countered by depictions of happy
and sexually liberated Muslims. Arguably, both of these perspectives are simplistic:
one dwelling on problems that have some substance but which are exaggerated and
wildly distorted, and the other glossing over tensions and challenges in its effort to
present a more positive picture of the sexual lives of Muslims. The latter, however
well-meaning, idealises Muslims, potentially dehumanising them. Imen Neffati
(2016: n.p.), a Tunisian researcher based at the University of Sheffield, contends
that Muslims are too often rendered as `angelic' and `innocent', especially by leftist
writers. Neffati defends Daoud in the face of such ange´lisme, situating him as a
North African Muslim scholar criticising Islam from the inside. And yet, as we
have argued, Daoud's article is unbalanced in its attempt to confront the problems,
however real, that led to the sexual attacks in Germany.
Pulling in an opposite direction, Pnina Werbner provides fascinating, but per-
haps overly optimistic, discussion of everyday multiculturalism and conviviality
amongst British Muslim communities, even as she recognises that these positive
interactions usually take place in gender-segregated private spaces (2013: 405).
However, her references to displays of `interethnic amity' (2013: 402) at the 2012
London Olympics and the mostly warm British reception towards then-emerging
10 Ethnicities 0(0)
Muslim athlete Mo Farah are complicated by her own acknowledgement that no
British Asians won medals at those Games and that the Daily Mail ignorantly
labelled Farah and other British medal-holders born outside the UK as `plastic
Brits' (2013: 413).
In the face of pervasive stereotype and counter-stereotype, hard criticism and
pulled punches, a balanced approach is sorely needed. This, we suggest, cannot be
found in combative or sensational writing, nor in turning a blind eye to horrific and
extreme events. A more variegated picture of the sexual lives of Muslims is found in
stories told by, rather than about, the people who are involved. It is, of course,
unwise to treat one person who identifies as a Muslim as representative of all
(British) Muslims. It is important to query this claim of authenticity, as evinced
by our discussion of Yasmin Alibhai-Brown's (2012) comment piece in the Daily
Mail, Daoud's bleak view of Muslim sexuality as `diseased', and Honesty Policy's
Pollyannaish counter-vision of harmonious, music-loving Muslims. Operating `as
Muslims', Alibhai-Brown added her weight to the agenda the Daily Mail had been
peddling for some time, while the translation of Daoud's article was undertaken by
the New York Times directly after a period of significant trauma and tension for
Germany. Although there are many problematic descriptions of Muslims by
Muslims, both in fiction and in the media, it remains crucial to hear from rather
than just about this cultural and religious group. If we are to challenge negative
stereotypes with something more layered than a counter-stereotype like that created
by Honesty Policy, it is necessary to examine long-form non-fiction and creative
writing by Muslims of various political persuasions. Leaving aside a few honourable
exceptions of non-Muslim authors who write about Muslims with sensitivity (Caute,
1998; Sahota, 2011), many others such as Martin Amis (2008), Ian McEwan (2005),
Sebastian Faulks (2010) and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs Boris Johnson (2005) have fictionalised sensationalist topics such as terror-
ism and created simplified representations of the figure of the violent extremist. The
legacy of this kind of pigeonholing of the Muslim experience is damaging (Morey
and Yaqin, 2011). Turning to Muslim writers, they are uniquely capable of exam-
ining Islam from an insider's perspective in a variety of subtle ways, while sometimes
also voicing criticism of religious practice and cultural accretions.
More nuanced stories of Muslim sexuality: Shelina Zahra
Janmohamed
While the most successful critical journalism creates nuanced stories with space for
unresolved tensions and manifest complexities, the natural home for these stories is
undoubtedly fiction. For subtle and searching depictions of Muslim experiences of
courtship and marriage, then, we reach for works such as Ayisha Malik's (2016)
Sofia Khan Is Not Obliged and Shelina Zahra Janmohamed's Love in a Headscarf:
Muslim Woman Seeks the One (2009).4 While not discussed at length in this article,
the grittier topic of forced marriage is the subject of Sufiya Ahmed's Secrets of the
Chambers et al. 11
Henna Girl (2012), whereas in her debut novel, Stained (2016), Abda Khan broaches
the complex nature of `honour' crimes, rape and the shame that surrounds it in one
northern English Pakistani community. Several other published works (while not
focused on to any significant degree here) also embrace exploration of extra-marital
affairs, such as in Hanif Kureishi's The Black Album (1995) and Nadeem Aslam's
(2004) Maps for Lost Lovers, as well as young people coming of age, as in Kureishi's
The Buddha of Suburbia (1990) and Zahid Hussain's The Curry Mile (2006).5
To analyse literary representations of Muslims' relationship experiences, close
reading ­ the sine qua non of literary studies ­ is employed as a methodology (see
Federico, 2016; Lentricchia and DuBois, 2003) through which to interpret Muslim-
identified authors and their written works. In our search for a figure who is capable
of communicating a particular religious Muslim experience but does not claim to
speak for all Muslims, we come to Shelina Zahra Jamohamed ­ a writer whose
extensive works range across the spectrum of journalism, as well as complex,
playful and literary media. Janmohamed is a practising Muslim with East
African Asian heritage who has regularly lectured at her local mosque
(Janmohamed, 2009: 129), and is increasingly in demand as a media spokesperson
on Muslim issues such as 2016's burkini ban in France. Until 2015 Janmohamed
wrote a popular blog, Spirit 21, and she often contributes opinion pieces for such
print media as the Times, Guardian and Muslim News. In both her fiction and her
journalistic reportage she presents textured pictures of Muslims' sexual relation-
ships and explores connections between religious, national and ethnic identities,
thus enabling her to tell stories and share experiences with greater precision and
wholeness than those found in the mainstream media.
In 2013, Janmohamed wrote a much-discussed article for the Telegraph, entitled
`What Muslim Women Really Want in the Bedroom'. According to Islamic teach-
ing, sex is supposed to be between a married couple, but within that prescription
the author takes pains to communicate that there is considerable leeway. For
example, she interviewed the CEO of El Asira, an online shop selling a range of
halal sensual unguents and candles, as well as an Irish Muslim convert who runs a
course teaching Muslim women their sexual rights. Peppering the article with
examples from Islamic teaching, Janmohamed recalls a famous incident from
the Sunnah in which the Prophet Mohammed rebuked an overly pious husband
for sexually neglecting his wife. Also recounted is the teaching that Allah gave nine
parts of desire to women and only one to men. `What Muslim Women Really
Want in the Bedroom' makes clear, contrary to popular belief, that `Islam has
always been extremely open about sexual pleasure, and in particular women's
pleasure' (Janmohamed, 2013: n.p.).
This understanding also runs through her first book, Love in a Headscarf, which
was published in 2009. Love in a Headscarf is at once a memoir, a Bildungsroman
and, as Lucinda Newns demonstrates (2017), a type of self-help book and chick lit
novel.6 With a narrative arc shaped by the author's search for a compatibly reli-
gious, attractive and intelligent husband, it is a memoir heavily inflected by what
Sara Ahmed calls `the promise of happiness'. Indeed, as Sara Ahmed demonstrates
12 Ethnicities 0(0)
(2010a: 7), heteronormative positive psychology problematically posits marriage as
one of the foremost gauges of happiness.
Love in a Headscarf contains echoes of the genres to which Janmohamed is
indebted ­ there is more than a touch of Bridget Jones to the protagonist ­ but
it is strikingly different from bestselling chick lit novels such as Helen Fielding's
fiction, as it explores relationships through a Muslim-identified lens. For example,
the story departs from the individualistic underpinnings of other works in this
genre: `My marriage', declares Janmohamed, `[. . .] was a collective experience'
(2009: 64). Love in a Headscarf narrates the author's wearisome relationship jour-
ney as she deals with interfering aunties and matchmakers, hapless and unsuitable
rishtas and the emerging rules of (Muslim) Internet dating ­ all the while striving
not to compromise her faith.
Janmohamed incorporates an experience of speed dating into Love in a
Headscarf. This contemporary dating phenomenon is detailed towards the end
of the book when the narrator has almost given up on finding a husband, and
the tone is thus ruefully reflective. She attends two speed dating events designed
specifically to connect single Muslims. From the outset, the first event instills
a sense of uneasiness due to the (remarkably unsuitable) venue ­ a `nightclub-
cum-bar'. Naturally, as a teetotaller, she is unfamiliar with this environment.
Her discomfort fails to dissipate over the course of the evening; in fact, if anything
it increases. There are few men, and those who do circulate the tables show no
interest in this modest hijabi, only having eyes for women who are dressed with
Bollywood extravagance. The second speed dating function has more promise,
largely because there is a substantial fee involved and the organisers undertake
vetting procedures, which Janmohamed compares to `an all-encompassing Auntie
process' (2009: 242). With this comment, she gestures towards the often-made
point that online dating algorithms are not dissimilar to the matchmaking
techniques responsible for many South Asian arranged marriages. Yet even at
the more professional function, men are in short supply and largely uninterested.
Indeed, it transpires that a number of them have even been paid to attend the event
and make up the numbers. Janmohamed concludes this speed dating chapter by
depicting the `paired' couples at the event dissolving into the throngs encircling
the sacred Kaaba at Mecca on her subsequent Hajj pilgrimage. Watching the
reverential crowd, her narrator positions love as a communitarian rather than
an individual pursuit:
I knew that I was different because I was me, but I was also the same as everyone,
because I was a human being. Each of us occupied so many spaces and identities, and
that made us multiversal, not identical. I had been searching to find a partner to love and
had been trying to learn about Divine love. In front of me now I realised that there was
one more kind of love that was essential: the love for other human beings (2009: 246).
In Generation M: Young Muslims Changing the World (2016), a work of creative
non-fiction, Janmohamed develops a number of themes related to relationships
Chambers et al. 13
and sexuality, while representing young practising Muslims ­ `Generation M' ­ as
a digitally connected, creative and enterprising faith group. Continuing Love in a
Headscarf's agenda and chiming with the increasingly prevalent literary strategy
(also seen in Ayisha Malik's fiction) of writing against the `misery memoir' (see
Chambers, 2013), Generation M is centrally concerned to dispute the intertwined
stereotypes of the repressive Muslim man and downtrodden Muslim woman.
Without denying that some Muslim women face oppression, Janmohamed
sketches a group of exhuberantly consumerist yet pious women who identify as
British Muslims and who possess complete agency over their lives, including their
sexuality and relationships. When describing themselves, their choice of clothing
and the businesses they have established to market their stylish but devout life-
styles, these women use playful portmanteau words like `hijabilicious' and
`Mipster' (Janmohamed, 2016: 28, 29, 135, 136).7 All this is summed up in a
single Tweet that Janmohamed uses as a chapter heading: `Forgot to be
Oppressed, Too Busy Being Awesome' (2016: 221­244). Raising the issue of how
Muslims meet their future partners, she argues that Generation M are engaging in
leading-edge practices around sexuality just as they are in the finance, tech, food,
creative and fashion industries which she also explores in detail. Evaluating
Muslim matrimonial sites such as SingleMuslim.com, Janmohamed insists that
these form `a natural extension' of longstanding networks of family members
(2016: 92) as well as unrelated `Buxom Aunties' and other fixers, who are depicted
in Love in a Headscarf (2009: 46) as setting up meetings with potential husbands.
As such, the Internet is regarded as a convenient and efficient space in which to
find a fellow Muslim life partner without having to adjust to the perilous world of
`"Western-style" dating' (2016: 92).
Janmohamed has long been an advocate of stories and narratives as vehicles
through which to disseminate positive aspects of Muslim experiences, including
those connected to desire, love and relationships. In `What Muslim Women Really
Want in the Bedroom', she draws attention to `contextually appropriate teachings'
(2013: n.p.) on sexuality, from Saudi Arabian author Randa Abdel-Fattah's No
Sex in the City (2013) to the controversial UAE sex manual, Top Secret: Sexual
Guidance for Married Couples by Wedad Lootah (2009). By focusing her full
attention on `good news stories', though, Janmohamed sometimes misses details
that complicate the bigger picture. For example, in her discussion of Sufiya
Ahmed's writing (Janmohamed, 2013: n.p.), she concentrates on Ahmed's self-
published Khadija Academy series about a Muslim boarding school (2007,
2010b, 2011), but fails to mention her more high-profile Puffin Young Adult
novel about forced marriage, Secrets of the Henna Girl (Ahmed, 2012).
Tellingly, the latter text does not fit with Janmohamed's anti-miserabilist approach
to Islam and literature. Her neglect of stories that do not tessellate with her
approach suggests that there are limitations to Janmohamed's purview. Before
discussing these limitations, the sad fact should not escape our notice that
Janmohamed's work seems innovative precisely because she reframes British
Muslim female sexuality as happy, healthy and ordinary.

Sexuality as silence and tension
Janmohamed's exclusion of Ahmed's most well-known novel from her analysis
points to a more general argument: stories about Muslims exploring and enjoying
their sexualities, at least within married life, do not tell the whole truth. If we took
this discussion no further, we would be guilty of glossing over tensions and com-
plexities which are perhaps universal experiences of human sexuality. Indeed, the
purpose of this article is to contest the simplistic but widespread binary thinking
about Muslims, including in relation to their sexuality. This binary way of thinking
was especially evident in Tony Blair's Manichean rhetoric and policies, but con-
tinued in David Cameron's diction of `muscular liberalism', which he preferred to
the so-called `passive tolerance of recent years' (Cameron, 2011: n.p.). Today, it
also informs Theresa May's dualistic attempt to separate `organisations that
respect British values' from `extremist organisations' (May, 2014: n.p.). These
specific interventions mobilise a more generic binary discourse, which Mahmood
Mamdani (2002, 2004) has influentially called the `good Muslim, bad Muslim'
dichotomy: `Good Muslims are modern, secular, and Westernised, but Bad
Muslims are doctrinal, antimodern and virulent' (Mamdani, 2004: 25). In other
words, Muslims constructed as `good' are those who conform to Western under-
standings of happiness, who have given up their heritage and community in favour
of individualism, believe religion should be relegated to the private sphere, and are
unequivocally in favour of liberal democracy. Within this Eurocentric discursive
logic, the `good Muslim' is the exception that proves the rule since, as Joseph
Massad (2015) persuasively argues, Islam is constructed as liberalism's `other'.
From this perspective, the `bad Muslim' comes to be seen as Islam's true face
and the `good Muslim' is viewed as an aberration (Shryock, 2010).
It may be tempting to counter negative descriptions of Muslims by asserting
counter-stereotypes, which answer Islamophobia with Islamophilia, `bad Muslims'
with `good Muslims'. And yet, as Andrew Shryock argues in his 2010 monograph
Islamophobia/Islamophilia, this simply reproduces problematic binaries and
stereotypes:
The `good Muslim', as a stereotype, has common features: he tends to be a Sufi
(ideally, one who reads Rumi); he is peaceful (and assures us that jihad is an inner,
spiritual contest, not a struggle to `enjoin the good and forbid the wrong' through
force of arms); he treats women as equals, and is committed to choice in matters of
hijab wearing (and never advocates the covering of a woman's face); if he is a she, then
she is highly educated, works outside the home, is her husband's only wife, chose her
husband freely, and wears hijab (if at all) only because she wants to. (2010: 10)
Shryock argues that Islamophilia ­ as well as its more obviously harmful opposite
Islamophobia ­ rests on stereotypes. Islamophilia, he suggests, constrains Muslims
within black and white saintly categories out of `wishful thinking and a politics of
fear' (2010: 10).
Chambers et al. 15
There are important implications here for thinking beyond simplistic represen-
tations of Muslims' sexualities and relationships, beyond the cliches that they are
either `miserable' or `happy'. While it is important to recognise the happiness and
fulfilment which many Muslims experience in their sexual relationships, it is equal-
ly important to acknowledge the difficulties that also exist, some of which are
directly related to being a Muslim and a member of a family and community
influenced by Islam.
One specific issue, which is illustrative of the limitations some Muslims experi-
ence in their sexual lives and which speaks to the existence of desires that cannot be
contained within conventional marriage, is same-sex sexuality. This is addressed by
Muslim writers in two different ways: first, through silences or awkward mentions,
much as though to an elephant in the room; second, through stories of love and
desire featuring gay or bisexual Muslim men and women. In Janmohamed's work,
homosexuality constitutes silence. As a sexual preference and identity, it is either
avoided altogether or only very briefly mentioned. A possible reason for this could
be that her views on sexuality are heteronormative, as are those (broadly speaking)
of the chick lit genre in general.
Without straying too far from our primary focus, it should also be observed that
chick lit in general and Janmohamed's work in particular often reinforce tradi-
tional gender binaries. Love in a Headscarf is hardly a feminist text and, while
Janmohamed pays some lip service to feminist achievements around women's dress
choice and campaigns for workplace gender equality, her argument implicitly
conflates diverse feminist groupings as being transhistorical, Islamophobic and
concerned with the single issue of white women's rights (2009: 170). Although
inventive in the way that the book challenges the norms of companionate marriage
(Newns, 2017) and received ideas about submissive hijabis (Ahmed, 2015: 208),
this post-feminist chick lit-esque memoir may also be responsible for feeding patri-
archal discourses.
To provide an example of heteronormativity from Love in a Headscarf,
Janmohamed's narrator takes issue with some orthodox Muslims' belief that it
is necessary for women to cover their hair in order to forestall men's inevitable and
uncontrollable sexual desire. Her objections to this position of belief concentrate
on refuting the implication that men are `sex-crazed monsters' (2009: 160) and
asserting that modest dress is necessary for women and men, both of whom are
perfectly capable of self-restraint. Same-sex desire is never even raised as a possi-
bility in this piece of life writing which recounts the search for a marriage partner
to complete one's faith.
Moving to Generation M, homosexuality is discussed on one occasion, amidst
an evaluation of sexuality as a `hot topic' for contemporary global Muslims. In this
instance, Janmohamed acknowledges in a carefully neutral tone that `[t]he place
and role of LGBTQ groups is part of the mix' of such discussion (2016: 189). She
goes on to condemn the mass shooting perpetrated by an American Muslim at
Pulse ­ the gay nightclub in Orlando ­ in June 2016, just as Generation M was
going to press. The murders of gay clubbers, Janmohamed blandly suggests,
16 Ethnicities 0(0)
`further heightened discussions that were already happening about Islam and sex-
uality, pushing for greater openness and understanding' (2016: 189). Lack of clar-
ity around the grammatical subject allows her to evade specificity as to who is
doing the pushing and what this `openness and understanding' will entail. She then
moves swiftly on to repeat a rather conservative point made in `What Muslim
Women Really Want in the Bedroom' ­ namely, that the modern world's `highly
sexualised' atmosphere is difficult and fraught for `those Muslims who want to live
a chaste life ­ especially in environments where virginity is often seen as freakish'
(2016: 189; see also 2013: n.p.). The juxtaposition of the Orlando nightclub shoot-
ing alongside her point about preserving virginity in an eroticised environment
implies that gay sex is a sin that should be discouraged, but that the sinner should
be granted understanding and support. This viewpoint is reinforced by the fact
that while Janmohamed interviewed a range of Muslim men and women for
Generation M, she apparently did not reach out to speak to any openly gay
Muslims.
Recently, a new type of chick lit novel has emerged which focuses on Muslim
dating and marriage, as exemplified by Ayisha Malik's two novels, Sofia Khan Is
Not Obliged (2016) and its sequel The Other Half of Happiness (2017). Like Love in
a Headscarf, these novels aim to rework Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary
(1996) and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (1999) from a Muslim perspective
and explode some stereotypes in the process. Indeed, in her article `Quand
l'Angleterre invente la «Bridget Jones» musulmane' (`When England Invented the
Muslim "Bridget Jones"'), He
´ laine Lefranc¸ ois quotes Malik on her motivations for
writing the novel: `Je ne voulais pas d'une e´nie`me histoire sur une femme musulmane
qui arrache son voile, couche avec des hommes et, au final, adopte une mode de vie
auquel elle ne croit pas' (`I didn't want another story about a Muslim woman who
removes her veil, sleeps with men, and ultimately adopts a lifestyle she doesn't
believe in') (Lefranc¸ ois, 2016: n.p.; our translation).
Unlike her predecessor, however, Malik does make some effort to acknowledge,
or at least register, same-sex desire as a possibility. Like Bridget Jones and Malik
herself,8 Sofia Khan Is Not Obliged's titular protagonist works for some time in the
publishing industry. After her office Christmas party, a senior colleague and friend,
Katie, persuades Sofia to go clubbing with her, setting the scene for some of the
novel's finest jokes and most intriguing reflections. Outside the club, Sofia runs
into a man she had gone on an online date with some weeks before, during which
he emphasised how much he enjoyed attending mosque with his father. This good-
looking young British Pakistani whom she had privately nicknamed `Hottie' is
shamefaced to see her there and it slowly dawns on Sofia that he is gay. Of
course, Hottie may genuinely enjoy attending mosque and also be gay. Sofia's
thought process, however, appears to be that Islam and LGBTQIþ sexualities
are incompatible, as evidenced when she guiltily thinks: `I've not punctured a
tiny hole in his veneer ­ I've exposed everything completely' (2016: n.p.).
Sympathetic to his apparent fear that Sofia might `out' him to his family, she
plays along with his pretence that he is simply waiting for friends coincidentally
Chambers et al. 17
outside the predominantly gay superclub Heaven. While Malik's engagement with
same-sex desire is for the most part funny and thoughtful, it is disappointing that
the encounter is so brief and tinged with sympathy for the gay man's apparent
melancholia. As Hottie and Sofia are about to part ways, he calls out to her:
I turned around. He stood isolated in the middle, cast in the shadow of flashing lights.
`I really do love going to the mosque with my dad.'
In that moment he looked so beautiful and so sad, I wanted to take him home and
make him a cup of tea. But I couldn't. He won't ever want to see me again. I smiled
and nodded. `Never doubted it.' (2016: n.p.)
Here, Malik portrays her heroine as free-thinking and tolerant ­ as well as
quintessentially British, given the suppressed impulse to tackle a crisis with tea.
Problematically, Hottie is figured as a misfit who is wistful that he can never share
his full self with his parents without the spectre of potential ostracisation or similar
ramifications. Malik seems unable to imagine a positive future for a gay man
within family-oriented British Muslim culture. Sara Ahmed perceptively discusses
such projection of sadness by straight people onto what she terms `unhappy
queers': `[T]he queer life is already constructed as an unhappy life, as a life without
the "things" that make you happy, or as a life that is depressed as it lacks certain
things: "a husband, children"' (2010a: 93). Entirely pushed to the margins and
confined within an assumed affective geography, Hottie swiftly disappears from
the pages of what Candis magazine dubs a `light-hearted book crammed with witty
humour' (2016: blurb).
If Ayisha Malik constructs Sofia Khan Is Not Obliged as a counter-narrative to
the Muslim misery memoir, then her sequel, The Other Half of Happiness, focuses
on a relationship's afterlife once the euphoria wears off. As Sofia tells a journalist
who interviews her about her Muslim marriage guidance book: `You and I both
know that happily ever after doesn't exist' (2017: 188). The `other half' of the title
is Sofia's Irish convert husband Conall who, to adapt Sara Ahmed (2010a: 17,
223), makes Sofia `hapless' in love. The novel pivots on the couple's fraught first
year of marriage, replete as it is with misunderstanding and discord, despite their
mutual desire and affection. The novel goes further, indicating that Pakistani
Muslim marriage is not merely made up of the two `halves' of husband and
wife. Readers are also presented with Sofia's widowed mother, who sacrifices her
own hard-won, nascent romantic relationship out of sympathy when Sofia and
Conall separate. The mother too, frames this in terms of misery and joy, so that
Sofia realises `[t]he only threat to Mum's happiness has been me' (2017: 362).
One of the factors that contributes to Sofia's marital breakdown is her paranoia
about the beauty and easy intimacy of Conall's friend and colleague, Hamida.
That she turns out to be a lesbian is merely a plot device to reveal that she is no
threat to Sofia and Conall's happiness. As with Hottie in Sofia Khan Is Not
Obliged, Hamida vanishes for a significant portion of the novel; yet, unlike
Hottie, Hamida does reappear, albeit briefly. Indeed, when Hamida reappears, it
18 Ethnicities 0(0)
is to demand that Sofia gives Conall a divorce, thus allowing him to find happiness
in the future. Interestingly, Hamida is also present in Pakistan for the novel's
cliffhanger of an ending where Sofia confronts Conall. In this coda, Hamida
accuses Sofia of being a bigot and fearing that Hamida will make sexual advances
towards the straight woman, to which Sofia self-deprecatingly responds by stating
that she does not view this possibility as any danger (2017: 398). Once again,
Malik's queer character merely serves to showcase Sofia's broad-mindedness and
remains little more than a cipher. Sofia claims not to judge Hamida but, as Sara
Ahmed astutely observes in another context, the straight subject pushes the queer
body to the margins, associating her with `an imagined future of necessary and
inevitable unhappiness' (2010a: 93). This is made apparent when Sofia claims that
`[t]he only thing that made me sad for [Hamida] was that people had rejected her so
spectacularly that she'd rejected her faith' (2017: 399). With Sofia dissociating
herself and her Islamic faith from Hamida's parents' and others' homophobia,
Malik seems to have an imaginative blockage that prevents her from conceptual-
ising same-sex love as anything but peripheral and `sad'.
In sum, it is important to acknowledge that much of this women's writing is
market-driven and, as such, seeks to present a commercial `Muslim Bridget Jones'
that at times recycles gender and sexual norms and stereotypes. Yet it is also
necessary to highlight the self-conscious timbre of Malik's novels in particular,
wherein the heroine works for a publisher and is invited to write her books for
overtly commercial, profit-oriented reasons. In this way, Malik does not pretend
that the books are more or less than what they are, working as they do within the
constraints of the medium and market. The light-hearted tone that is a key feature
of chick lit (problematic though that term may be),9 is also positive in its efforts to
work against the portrayal of misery and to demonstrate something light, breezy
and undeniably engaged in the pursuit of happiness.
Same-sex Muslim relationships
We now make space for texts that give same-sex Muslim relationships direct and
full attention ­ such as Amjeed Kabil's Straightening Ali ­ even if these texts have
blind spots of their own. Kabil's novel is about 24-year-old Ali Mirza, a gay
Pakistani-heritage man from Birmingham. Ali comes out to his family before
the novel opens after exploring his sexuality while a student at the University of
Wolverhampton. Regardless of his open communication regarding his sexuality,
he is nonetheless under pressure to submit to an arranged marriage with a 20-year-old
woman, Sajda, whom he has never met. Emotionally blackmailing Ali, his mother
fakes a heart attack to force him into accepting her wishes. Ali's family also have
an ulterior motive, as they hope that the marriage between Ali and Sajda will
function as a conduit to gain entrance into the high echelons of the Nottingham
Pakistani community, where Sajda's family hold prestige and power. The Mirzas
are also keen, as the title suggests, to `straighten' out the youngest boy in
the family. They view Ali's sexuality as a phase brought on by contact
Chambers et al. 19
with white fellow students who fail to `understand [. . .] our culture' (2007: 8), as his
sister puts it. Awash with guilt over his mother's distress and `heart attack', Ali
ends his long-distance relationship with his boyfriend, Steve, who has been living
in Strasbourg. However, despite his compliance with the proposed marriage, Ali
still faces horrific homophobic abuse from his family. For example, his
`fundamentalist' elder sister Yasmin argues that gay people `should all be put on
an island and shot' and informs him that it is a parent's `Islamic duty' to arrange
their child's marriage (2007: 4, 134), while his macho older brother Yunus
repeatedly beats him and calls him a `batty boy' (2007: 8, 10). Even Ali's
supportive younger sister Aneesa insists that he is `lucky' and the family
`modern' to allow him to meet his bride before the wedding (2007: 23, 25).
A series of set pieces unfolds; these scenarios are typical of the British-Asian
marriage plot but are poignantly altered by the backdrop of non-heteronormative
sexuality. The two prospective families-in-law meet over samosas, and Sajda and
Ali are generously given five minutes together while they are watched from a
distance by a chaperone (2007: 51, 52). After a mournful twist on the British
tradition of the stag party at a Bollywood night in Ali's favourite gay club,
Sajda and Ali partake in gender-segregated events such as the mehndi ceremony.
At the wedding, Ali's father-in-law communicates the bride's consent, while
Sajda's emotional response is limited to crying (as is customary) on leaving her
family. Sajda's distress soon abates, it becoming awkwardly apparent that she and
Ali have different expectations of their wedding night.
Kabil seems just as incapable of imagining happiness for his protagonist within
the `gay community' as he is of envisioning a positive future for him in a British
Pakistani milieu. After fobbing Sajda off from her conjugal rights, Ali considers
suicide and dreams of escape. He flees his marriage without consummating it,
boarding a plane to Strasbourg, on which he has to fend off the advances of a
lecherous older Italian man named Benigno. If contentment for Ali cannot be
found within the family, equally outside of this kinship group he is bereft of the
social and economic security he once knew and relied on. This leaves Ali vulner-
able and dependent on equally undesirable sources of livelihood, symbolised by
Benigno. When Ali arrives in Strasbourg, it transpires that Steve has quickly
moved on to a new relationship. With no other option and rapidly running out
of money, Ali returns to Britain. While his father-in-law sends him a poisonous
letter and Sajda tries to convince him that she can help him `be normal', Ali
descends into depression and poverty, eventually succumbing to homelessness
and becoming prey to an older gay man. Finally, Ali is offered a glimpse of free-
dom. This support does not come from either the Pakistani or gay communities,
but rather from HITS Homes Trust (a Leicester based social housing organisation
for which Kabil worked for several years). The Trust offers Ali a small flat, and the
novel closes with his bittersweet pleasure on moving into this new, if isolated,
home. This plot device carefully avoids accusations of white saviour discourse
by introducing a Pakistani, Naureen, as one of the HITS employees. However,
20 Ethnicities 0(0)
as Shamira Meghani states, Naureen `is undeveloped as a character, and [only]
appears at a point in the narrative that is invested in Ali's survival' (2015: 178).
Kabil's novel cuts through the silence and tensions that envelop Janmohamed's
allusions to same-sex desire and relationships. However, its publication by an
under-resourced American press means that the writing is often error-ridden, inel-
egant and cliched, its narrative at times little more than an extended family argu-
ment with the volume turned up. The novel largely falls back on stereotypes that
taint Muslims as `homophobic [and] sexist' (Haritaworn et al., 2008: 85) and Islam
as easily co-opted into Muslim parents' overbearing obsession with arranging
marriages for their single children. As Kavita Bhanot writes with heavy irony
about this overworked trope in her anthology of `new generation' British Asian
fiction Too Asian, Not Asian Enough: `[O]ppressive parents [. . .] hold us back from
the pleasures and normality of western life: they don't let us [. . .] go to pubs and
clubs; [. . .]; they don't allow us to have relationships of our choice and want us to
have arranged marriages' (2011: vii, viii).
The received ideas in Straightening Ali can be usefully interrogated in the light
of Jasbir K. Puar's notion of `homonationalism'. In Terrorist Assemblages:
Homonationalism in Queer Times, Puar coins this term to delineate how America
and the wider `Western world' scrambled to reinvent itself as tolerant towards
same-sex desire after 9/11. Puar argues that this rush towards national identifica-
tion as freethinking and tolerant was simply a means by which to cast Muslims,
especially Arab Muslims, as `a queer, nonnational, perversely racialized other'
(Puar, 2007: 37). Certainly, Ali's mother is portrayed as irredeemably `other'
and non-national, evidenced by her wedding ­ at the alarmingly young age of
15 to a stranger more than a decade older than she ­ as the bleak marital
model. Ali's mother repeatedly uses her late husband's, her own and Ali's happi-
ness as the excuse to pressure him into agreeing to a joyless marriage (Kabil, 2007:
7­13). This accords with Sara Ahmed's parsing of the speech act `I just want you to
be happy', through which, Ahmed argues, `the desire for just happiness appears to
give the other a certain freedom and yet directs the other toward what is already
agreed to be the cause of happiness' (2010a: 133). In this way, and similarly to
Sofia Khan Is Not Obliged and its sequel The Other Half of Happiness,
Straightening Ali is complicit with certain Western narrative conventions (in this
case, the myth of European `tolerance' of non-normative sexualities) for the sake
of marketability.
Straightening Ali is nonetheless significant in being one of only a few texts10 that
deal with the experiences of British Muslims whose desires and relationships are
oriented towards their own sex. It is to be hoped that, over the coming years, the
British literary scene will be able to boast some subtler representations of same-sex
Muslim relationships,11 just as Saleem Haddad's new novel Guapa (2016) is receiv-
ing plaudits in the United States for its portrayal of gay Arab-American Muslims.
This is not to call for a `British Muslim gay literature' modelled on its non-Muslim
British and American counterparts. It may take that form, but equally it
Chambers et al. 21
may explore same-sex desires and relationships in ways that have not yet
been imagined.
Conclusion: possible ways forward
A challenging but valuable component of some Muslim-identified literature is the
acknowledgement that sexual intimacies and relationships can be both joyful and
difficult, and that many of these contrasting experiences stem from being Muslim.
In this acknowledgement, which moves beyond negative stereotypes of miserable
Muslims but refuses to counter these with equally simplistic stories of happy
Muslims, it is possible to move beyond the repetitive cliches that dominate the
mainstream media. That said, it would be simplistic and sweeping to dismiss media
representations as caricatures while celebrating the supposedly subtler achieve-
ments of creative writers. The former characterisation may be disappointingly
accurate, as illustrated in the first part of this article, although exceptions and
counter-currents must also be acknowledged in the form of critical journalism.
The latter ­ literary works as nuanced and critically engaging ­ must equally be
interrogated rather than simply applauded. This interrogation should include a
critical examination of commercially driven publishers which encourage works
that engage with emerging but unstable genres such as `Muslim chick lit'. Critics
should also look for literary works that may be located within, as well as against,
dominant discourses, such as the Western and arguably neo-colonial liberal dis-
course that gives rise to binary characterisations of good and bad Muslims
(Massad, 2015).
More sustained and nuanced pictures of same-sex desire and relationships in
Muslim-identified literature, situated in the context of a broader discussion
rather than just concentrating on same-sex sexualities, are surely a constructive
way forward. Such literary work, in the form of storied explorations of Muslims'
relationships and sexualities, would find ways to attend to various taboo issues.
Stories might achieve this through modes that are appropriate in different Muslim-
identified settings, not necessarily replicating the `taboo-busting' gestures of the
wider society. This creative work could also examine themes that some mainstream
sources regularly misrepresent or confuse. These include the different roles
played by religion, ethnicity and culture in the relationship experiences and
practices of Muslims.
While calling for more direct attention to the silences inherent in some Muslim-
identified literature, the real achievements that have already been made are to be
commended. There are other writers ­ some publishing through formal channels,
others self-publishing, still others blogging or using alternative media (see, for
example, Humza, 2010; Qureshi, n.d.) ­ who have not yet received the attention
they deserve. Critics, ourselves included, therefore must be more imaginative and
probing in the Muslim literatures we recognise and engage with. The Bradford
Literature Festival and various other festivals and literary events are already pro-
viding space for new writers to share their work and for audiences to engage with
22 Ethnicities 0(0)
them and with each other. Such a nurturing infrastructure should be encouraged
and further developed.
Throughout this article, we have discussed journalists and writers, newspapers
and publishers, and have therefore focused upon those with the privilege and the
power to convey their experiences and views through formal and high-profile
channels. In doing so, we realise that we have omitted many people who really
count: those who buy newspapers, browse newspaper websites online, read novels
and discuss all these stories with their friends and families. Here, among unseen
audiences, is where many of the real meanings are made: where stories are believed
or doubted, where individuals recognise themselves or their family members or
where they decide that their own experiences have been misconstrued or ignored.

Notes
1. The authors would like to thank Ghaziyah Weller for suggesting this point.
2. We use the term BAME to reflect British policy discourses, which employ it to refer to
minority ethnic populations of non-white backgrounds. This is similar to `Black (and)
Minority Ethnic' (BME), but the `A' in `BAME' singles out Asian communities as the
largest minority assemblage alongside Black British. However, it is important to note
that the term bundles together populations with highly diverse national, cultural and
ethnic origins. Whilst such acronyms have their uses when grouping those people who
find themselves on the receiving end of racism, it is also important to acknowledge the
limitations of such homogenising terminology, which can mask the varying degrees of
disadvantage suffered by people from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds within
that grouping.

3. In this sentence, Aslam recalls an inflammatory story from Angaaray (Shingavi, 2014),
the 1933 collection of socialist short stories which was banned by the Indian government
in response to protests. Sajjad Zaheer's story, `A Vision of Paradise', concerned a
Muslim cleric who falls asleep while he is praying and has a wet dream while still on
the prayer mat. Aslam would be aware of this story, which sparked riots in India,
because his father was an communist poet exiled from Pakistan due to his political
beliefs (Jaggi, 2013: n.p.).
4. Nasreen Akhtar's (2008) Catch a Fish from the Sea (Using the Internet) was more
interesting for being one of the earliest novels in this emerging genre centring on a
Muslim woman searching for a suitable partner than for its (rather uneven) form or
content.
5. It is important to recognise that these texts often explore several topics at once, with
Aslam's novel, for example, dealing with `honour' killing (as well as the CSE/A we have
already discussed), and Kureishi representing same-sex desire in The Buddha of
Suburbia.
6. `Chick lit' consists of `heroine-centered narratives' (Smith, 2008: 2) about the triumphs
and tragedies of women `in their twenties and thirties' (Ferriss and Young, 2006: 3),
with their subject matter mostly clustering around love, work and friendship. Often
humorous (Lefranc¸ ois, 2016: n.p.), their frequent celebration of consumerist culture
leads to them being described by Rocio Montoro as `cappuccino fiction' (2012: 1).
7. `Mipster' is a blend word that means Muslim hipster (see also Herding, 2013; Sheikh,
2013).
8. Ayisha Malik worked for several years as for Random House. By coincidence, one of
the project team, Claire Chambers, interviewed her in 2009 about her experiences as a
young muhajabah publisher. In this interview Malik stated that she had not been on the
receiving end of any discrimination during her few years in the publishing industry.
However, she did feel marked out at book launches, where she was usually the only
person present who had her head covered. She also wryly noted: `if there's a book being
published about Muslims, I find that some editors will come to me and ask me you
know, what do you think of this? Is this offensive? Is this not offensive?' (qtd. in
Chambers, 2009: n.p.). These experiences doubtless informed her portrayal of the pub-
lishing industry in both novels to date. It is finally worth noting that Malik recently
ghostwrote The Secret Lives of the Amir Sisters (Hussain and Malik, 2017) for Nadiya
Hussain, the politically perceptive and popular British-Bangladeshi who in 2015 won
the BBC show Great British Bake-Off.
9. He
´ laine Lefranc
¸ ois claims that Ayisha Malik `pre´fe`re parler de "fiction commercial"'
(`prefers to speak of `commercial fiction') (Lefranc
¸ ois, 2016: n.p.; my translation; empha-
sis in original).
10. See also Sarif (2008). Because Samim Sarif's novel I Can't Think Straight is about a
lesbian relationship between a Christian Palestinian and a South Asian British Muslim,
it falls outside the immediate purview of this study, which deals with depictions of
British Pakistani Muslims' sexual relationships. However, for discussion of this novel
and its film adaptation (I Can't Think Straight, 2008), see Alberto Ferna
´ ndez Carbajal's
excellent (2017) article.
11. Near to the time when this article was going to press, a play by one of the research
project Storying Relationships' partner writers, Kamal Kaan, was broadcast on BBC
Radio 4. Kaan's Breaking Up with Bradford (2017) centres on Kasim, who returns to his
24 Ethnicities 0(0)
hometown of Bradford after having fallen in love with another man, Richard, during
three years of university life in Cambridge. Given the theme of same-sex desire, it would
have been easy for this young playwright to perambulate the well-travelled `woe is me'
road. As is the case with Janmohamed and Malik, Kaan chooses to say little about
extremism, honour killings and child grooming, instead finding clever but unobtrusive
ways to poke fun and subvert all those expectations (bearing in mind the generally mild
and monocultural Radio 4 audience). He takes a more joyous and only occasionally
poignant route, exuberantly referencing the northern works Emily Bront
e's (1847/1996)
Wuthering Heights, Ayub Khan-Din's (1999/2007) East Is East and Chris Morris's
(2010) Four Lions, among other imaginative texts that have acted as influences.
Although from a Bangladeshi background, Kaan's upbringing and residence in
Bradford make him intimately familiar with British Pakistani Muslim ways of life,
and it is to be hoped that his radio play heralds the emergence of other creative
works treating same-sex relationships with wit and subtlety.
