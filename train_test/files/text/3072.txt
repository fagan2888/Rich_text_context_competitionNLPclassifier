Increased Levels of Cigarette Use
Among College Students
A Cause for National Concern
Henry Wechsler, PhD; Nancy A. Rigotti, MD; Jeana Gledhill-Hoyt, MPH; Hang Lee, PhD
Context.--Adolescent smoking prevalence is tracked annually and has in-
creased since 1991. In contrast, little is known about trends in smoking among col-
lege students, a group that has previously been more resistant to tobacco use than
other young adults.
Objective.---To examine changes in cigarette smoking among college students
between 1993 and 1997 and among different types of students and colleges.
Design.--Self-administered survey (Harvard School of Public Health College
Alcohol Study).
Setting.--One hundred sixteen nationally representative 4-year colleges.
Subjects.--A total of 15 103 randomly selected students in 1993 (70% response
rate) and 14251 students in 1997 (60% response rate).
Main Outcome Measures.--Self-reports of cigarette smoking in the past 30
days and in the past year, age at smoking first cigarette, and number of attempts
to quit.
Results.--Over 4 years, the prevalence of current (30-day) cigarette smoking
rose by 27.8%, from 22.3% to 28.5% (P.001). The increase was observed in 99
of 116 colleges and was statistically significant (P.05) in 27 (23%) of them. Cur-
rent smoking increased across all student subgroups (defined by sex, race/
ethnicity, and year in school) and in all types of colleges. Smoking is rising faster
in public schools (from 22.0% to 29.3%) than in private schools (from 22.9% to
26.8%). Eleven percent of college smokers had their first cigarette and 28% began
to smoke regularly at or after age 19 years, by which time most were already in col-
lege. Half of current smokers tried to quit in the previous year; 18% had made 5 or
more attempts to quit.
Conclusions.--Cigarette use is increasing on campuses nationwide in all sub-
groups and types of colleges. Substantial numbers of college students are both
starting to smoke regularly and trying to stop. National efforts to reduce smoking
should be extended to college students.

CIGARETTE SMOKING is the leading
preventablecauseofmorbidityandmor-
tality in the United States, responsible
for more than 400 000 deaths per year.1,2
Despiteadramaticreductioninsmoking

tobacco remains stubbornly popular
among adolescents and young adults, in
whomnearlyallsmokingstarts.3 Among
high school students, cigarette use in-
creased by 32% between 1991 and 1997,
followingadecadeofrelativestability.3-5
Unless many of these teenagers quit
soon after adolescence, the rise in youth
smoking will be reflected in rising smok-
ing rates among young adults (aged 18-
24 years). Ultimately, this trend threat-

since 1965 in the United States.1,6
The smoking behavior of college stu-
dents can provide valuable information
about trends in smoking among young
adults.UnitedStatescollegesanduniver-
sitiesenrollmorethan12millionstudents,
the majority of whom are aged 18 to 24
years.7 Onequarterofyoungadultsinthis

lege full- or part-time.8 The college years
provide an opportunity for interventions
to prevent future premature morbidity
and mortality by discouraging the initia-
tion or continuation of harmful health-re-
lated behaviors such as tobacco use.9-11
Cigarette smoking prevalence among
college students was assessed by 2 sepa-
rate cross-sectional surveys in the
1990s,12,13 but only the Monitoring the
Future Study provides information
about changes over time.14 This annual
survey tracks smoking in a national
sample of high school students and fol-
lowsasubsampleaftergraduation,when
some are full-time students at 2- and 4-
year colleges.14 Smoking among college
students in this study remained steady
from 1986 through 1990 and then in-
creased, reaching 27% in 1995. This find-
ing needs to be examined in a larger
groupofstudentsselectedfromanation-
ally representative sample of colleges.

cohol Study to report changes in ciga-
rette smoking between 1993 and 1997 in
2 large random samples of students en-
rolled at a nationally representative
sample of US 4-year colleges. The analy-
sis examines subgroups of students and
colleges to determine where change is
occurring most rapidly.
METHODS
Sample of Colleges
The 1993 College Alcohol Study sur-
veyedarandomsampleofstudentsin140
four-year US colleges.15 Initially, a ran-
dom sample of 179 schools was selected
from the American Council on Educa-
tion's list of accredited universities using
probability proportionate to size sam-
pling. Because the sample contained few
women-only colleges and few colleges
with enrollments of fewer than 1000 stu-
dents,10additionalwomen'scollegesand
15additionalsmallcollegeswereaddedto
the sample. Nine colleges were subse-
quently dropped because they were con-
sidered inappropriate (seminary schools,
militaryschools,andalliedhealthschools),
creating a final sample of 195 colleges. Of
this sample, 140 colleges (72%) partici-
pated in the 1993 survey.
In 1997, 130 (93%) of the original 140
colleges that participated in the 1993
CollegeAlcoholStudywereresurveyed.
In both years, the main reason for non-
participationwasadministrators'inabil-
ity to provide a random sample of stu-
dents' addresses within time require-
ments. Fourteen of the 130 schools that
participated in both years had low re-
sponse rates (defined as less than 45% of
eligible students responding) in either
year and were not included in the final
analysis,leavingafinalsampleof116col-
leges in both years.
The 116 schools represent a cross-sec-
tion of US higher education. They are lo-
cated in 39 states, with 22% in the North-
east, 29% in the South, 29% in the North
Centralregion,and19%intheWest.More
than two thirds of the colleges sampled
are public institutions; the remainder are
private. School enrollment was divided
into 3 categories: large schools with more
than 10 000 students enrolled (47%), me-
dium-sizedschoolswith5001to10 000stu-
dents enrolled (21%), and small schools
with 5000 or fewer students enrolled
(32%). About two thirds are located in an
urban or suburban setting and one third
in a small town or rural setting. Sixteen
percent have a religious affiliation. Five
percent enroll only women.
Sampling Procedures
In both years, administrators at each
college were asked to provide a random
sample of undergraduates drawn from
the total enrollment of full-time stu-
dents.Collegesweresentspecificguide-
linesfordrawingarandomsampleoffull-
timestudents.Dependingonenrollment
size, every xth student was selected
from the student registry using a ran-
dom starting point. In 1997, a sample of
230 students was provided from each of
the 130 participating colleges. In 1993, a
sample of 215 students was provided
from each of the participating colleges,
except that at 13 of the smallest schools,
only 108 were drawn.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire, largely about alco-
hol use, also assessed demographic and
background characteristics, smoking,
and other high-risk behaviors. The main
questions regarding substance use and
lifestyle were identical in the 1993 and
1997 survey instruments.15 Whenever
possible, questions were based on ques-
tions previouslyusedinotherlarge-scale
studies.14,16 To assess cigarette smoking,
respondents were asked when, if ever,
they had used cigarettes. Response op-
tionswere"neverused,""used,butnotin
the past 12 months," "used, but not in the
past 30 days," or "used in the past 30
days." A parallel question asked about
marijuanause.Studentswereaskedhow
many tobacco cigarettes per day they
smokedonaverage.The1997surveyalso
asked students how old they were when
they first smoked a cigarette and when
they started smoking regularly.
Mailing and Response Rate
Questionnaires were mailed to stu-
dentsattheendofFebruary1997.Three
separate mailings were sent within at
least a 3-week period: a questionnaire, a
reminder postcard, and a second ques-
tionnaire. Responses were voluntary
and anonymous. Students were encour-
aged to respond with cash awards. By
the end of April 1997, 84% of the final
group of questionnaires had been re-
turned; 15% arrived in May and 1% each
in June and July. The 1993 survey was
conducted in a similar manner.15
In 1997, questionnaires were mailed to
24 140 students at the 116 schools after
eliminating students with incorrect ad-
dresses, withdrawal from school, or
leaves of absence. A total of 14 521 stu-
dents (60%) returned questionnaires. In
1993, 15 103 (70%) of the 21 512 students
returned questionnaires. Response rate
varied among the 130 colleges that par-
ticipated in both years. In 1993, response
rates were between 18% and 100%, with
2 colleges having response rates of less
than 45%. In 1997, response rates varied
from 26% to 88%, with 12 colleges having
response rates of less than 45%. In both
years, the rate of current cigarette use
forthe116schoolswasnearlyidenticalto
theratefor130schools(28.5%and28.4%,
respectively, in 1997; 22.3% and 22.5%,
respectively, in 1993). Other smoking be-
haviors were similarly unaffected by
dropping the 14 low-response schools.
Several procedures were used to ex-
amine potential bias introduced by stu-
dent nonresponse. Response rates at in-
dividual colleges were not associated
with the 30-day smoking rate. The Pear-
soncorrelationcoefficientbetweenacol-
lege's 30-day smoking rate and its re-
sponse rate was -0.08 (P = .39) in 1993
and Â­0.08 (P = .38) in 1997. There was no
statistically significant difference in 30-
day smoking rates between students
who responded early vs late in either
1993 (2, 1.03; P = .31) or 1997 (2, 0.69;
P=.41).In1997,ashortformoftheques-
tionnaire including a smoking question
wasmailedtoasegmentofstudentswho
had failed to return the questionnaire.
The rate of 30-day smoking of those re-
sponding to the short survey did not dif-
fer significantly from that of those re-
sponding to the entire student survey.
Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out
using SAS statistical software.17,18 There
waslittledifferencebetweenunweighted
andweightedsampleresultsinbothyears
when compared, so unweighted results
are reported. Differences among the de-
mographic characteristics between sur-
vey years were compared by 2 analysis.
Percentage change in smoking preva-
lence between 1993 and 1997 was mea-
sured; confidence intervals (CIs) and
significance tests were carried out by the
largesampleapproximationoftestingfor
the equality of 2 independent binomial
proportions.
All students except those who re-
portedthattheyneversmokedwerecon-
sidered to be ever smokers. Former
smokers were defined as students who
had ever smoked, but not in the past 30
days. Current smokers were defined as
studentswhosmokedinthepast30days.
Current marijuana users were defined
as those who had used marijuana in the
past30days.Bingedrinkingwasdefined
as the consumption of 5 or more drinks in
a row for men and 4 or more drinks in a
row for women during the 2 weeks prior
to the survey, as previously described.15

with an exchangeable working correla-

ORs associated with the college charac-
teristics were slightly larger. Hence, the
results are not reported here.
RESULTS
Description of the Student Sample
Table 1 displays characteristics of
the respondents in 1993 (N = 15 103) and
1997 (N = 14 521), all of whom were en-
rolled at 1 of the 116 participating US
4-year colleges. The sample includes
more women than men, partly because
of the inclusion of 6 women's institu-
tions. It is similar to national estimates
that 54% of undergraduates at 4-year in-
stitutions in 1995 were women.21 The
samplewaspredominantlywhite,resem-
bling national 1995 data reporting that
78% of students at 4-year institutions
werewhite.21 Becauseofthelargesample
size, the 1993 and 1997 samples differed
statistically significantly on most demo-
graphic characteristics, but the abso-
lute percentage differences were minor.
Demographic differences for year in
school, race/ethnicity, and sex were con-
trolled for in the multiple logistic regres-
sion models.
Change in Smoking Prevalence
Table 2 displays the change in college
students' tobacco use between 1993 and
1997. The proportion of college students
who reported current cigarette smoking
rose 28% between 1993 and 1997
(P.0001). An increase was observed at
99 (85%) of 116 colleges in the sample and
wasstatisticallysignificant(P.05)for27
schools (23%). Smoking prevalence de-
creased significantly in only 1 school. The
proportion of students who had ever
smoked and the proportion who had
smoked in the past year also rose signifi-
cantly during the 4-year interval. In con-
trast, the proportion of students who quit
inthepastyearandthequitratio(thepro-
portion of former smokers divided by the
proportion of ever smokers) decreased.
Currentsmokers'dailytobaccoconsump-
tion changed significantly (P.001) dur-
ing the 4-year period. The largest abso-
luteincreasewasinregularlightsmokers
(1-9 cigarettes per day). In both years,
more than 40% of smokers averaged less
than 1 cigarette per day, indicating that
they did not smoke on a daily basis. Less
than 15% of current smokers smoked as
much as 1 pack of cigarettes daily.
Change in Smoking Prevalence
Among Demographic Subgroups
Theprevalenceofcurrentsmokingin-
creased over time across all subgroups
defined by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and
yearinschool(Table3).Theincreasewas
statistically significant for all demo-
graphic subgroups except Hispanic stu-
dents. There were no statistically sig-
nificant interactions between these fac-
tors and year of survey, indicating that
nogroupwasincreasingitssmokingrate
faster than any other. Instead, there ap-
peared to be a general rise in smoking
among all college students.
Change in Smoking Prevalence
Among College Subgroups
The rise in smoking prevalence was
alsoseenacrossallthecollegesubgroups

nificant interaction terms between sur-

leges than it did in private schools (ad-
justed OR, 1.18; P = .005). It also rose
more rapidly in the North Central re-
gion (adjusted OR, 1.13; P = .04) and less
rapidly in the Northeast (adjusted OR,
0.82; P = .003). These interactions failed
to meet significance when all demo-
graphic and college characteristics were
controlled for in the final multiple logis-
tic regression.
Correlates of Cigarette Use
The increase in current smoking
prevalence between 1993 and 1997 re-
mained statistically significant after ad-
justment for demographic and college
characteristics in a multiple logistic re-
gression model (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.33-
1.48; Table 5). Smoking prevalence was
higher in whites than blacks or Asians
and higher in freshmen, sophomores,
and juniors than seniors and fifth-year
students. Sex was not associated with
smoking behavior.
Smoking prevalence was indepen-
dently associated with several college
characteristics.Prevalencewaslowerat
private than public schools, lower at
commuter schools (defined as schools
where 90% or more of the students lived
off campus) than at residential schools,
and lower at highly competitive schools
(based on ACT and SAT scores and per-
centages of applicants accepted) com-
pared with less-competitive schools.22

Age of Smoking Initiation
and Efforts to Quit
Data on the age of first tobacco use
and attempts to quit were collected only
on the 1997 survey. Although only 11%
of smokers had their first cigarette at or
after age 19 years, more than one quar-
ter (28%) of current smokers began to
smoke regularly at age 19 or older, at
which time they were in college. Half
(n=2014)ofcurrentsmokersin1997had
quit smoking for at least 24 hours in the
past year, including 18% who had made
5 or more attempts to quit.
Alcohol and Marijuana Use
The increase in smoking prevalence
was not associated with binge drinking
or current marijuana use. Interaction
terms between survey year and both
binge drinking (P = .28) and marijuana
use (P = .25) were not significant, indi-
cating that the increase in smoking dur-
ingthe4-yearperiodwasindependentof

decreased by 3%, from 44.1% to 42.7%,
between 1993 and 1997, while current
marijuana use increased by 21%, from
12.7% to 15.4%.
COMMENT
This study clearly indicates that ciga-
rette smoking prevalence is rising
among college students. The increase is
occurringbroadlyacrossalltypesofstu-
dents and colleges, although the rise is
more rapid in public colleges than pri-
vate. This might reflect a difference by
students' socioeconomic status but be-
cause this factor was not directly mea-
sured, we cannot be certain. The rise in
college student smoking found in this
study confirms a previous report from
the Monitoring the Future Study14 and
is consistent with other national data.
According to the National Health Inter-
viewSurvey(NHIS),smokingamongall
US young adults aged 18 to 24 years be-
gan to rise after 1991.6,23 College student
smoking prevalence in our 1993 survey
(22%) was slightly higher than that re-
ported by the 1993 NHIS for young
adults with 13 or more years of educa-
tion (19.6% of men and 16.0% of women).
By 1995, the most recent year for which
NHIS data are available, young adult
smoking prevalence had risen to 24.0%
ofmenand18.5%ofwomen(unpublished
data, Office on Smoking and Health,
CentersforDiseaseControlandPreven-
tion, Atlanta, Ga, 1998). The National
College Health Risk Behavior Study re-
ported a 29% smoking rate among full-
and part-time students in 2- and 4-year
colleges in 1995. We observed a similar
smoking prevalence 2 years later in our
survey that includes only 4-year col-
leges. The discrepancy may be attribut-
able to the lack in our sample of 2-year
colleges that may have higher smoking
rates.
The rise in college student smoking
appearstobeaconsequenceoftherisein
adolescent smoking that occurred ear-
lier in the 1990s. The college students
surveyed in 1997 were high school se-
niors between 1993 and 1996, during
which time high school seniors' smoking
prevalence rates rose progressively fol-
lowingadecadeofstability.4,5 Thecohort
of college students surveyed in 1997 had
a higher smoking prevalence at college
entry than did the 1993 survey cohort.
These data suggest that the rise in ado-
lescent smoking that occurred in the
1990s is not a transient phenomenon.
They will likely have higher smoking
ratesasadultsandtherebycontributeto
higher overall adult smoking rates in fu-
ture years.
Inaddition,anincreaseinsmokingini-
tiation during the college years or a de-
crease in the proportion of students who
stopsmokingcouldalsocontributetoris-
ing college smoking rates. There was a
small decrease in the proportion of stu-
dents who quit smoking in the past year.
Our data cannot determine whether
smoking initiation rates among college
studentsarechangingbecausethisques-
tion was asked only in 1997. Only 11% of
that sample reported starting to smoke
after age 18 years, consistent with re-
ports of other national surveys of adults,
indicating that most first cigarette use
precedes the college years.23 However,
more than one quarter of college stu-
dents who smoked in 1997 reported
starting to smoke regularly in college
and half of current smokers in college
tried to quit at least once in the preced-
ing year. These data suggest that col-
lege is a time of considerable change in
smoking behavior.
The college years provide a window of
opportunityforinterventionsfocusedon
blocking the transition from occasional
smoking to regular nicotine-dependent
smoking and for efforts to increase the
success of the substantial number of
smokers who are already trying to quit.
These efforts are more likely to be suc-
cessful if they are paired with environ-
mental and policy changes that discour-
age tobacco use and reinforce to young
adults the message that not smoking is
the norm.24 This might be done effec-
tively by expanding the smoke-free ar-
eas on college campuses and especially
by ensuring that dormitories and other
shared living quarters are smoke-free.
In addition to eliminating secondhand
smoke, smoke-free areas limit the vis-
ibility and accessibility of cigarettes and
may discourage smoking initiation, help
keep occasional smokers from becoming
regular users, and boost the success of
those who are trying to quit.
The results of this study must be
viewed within the context of its limita-
tions. The lower response rate to the
1997 survey might have biased our find-
ings. However, several tests performed
to detect potential bias found none.
Smoking rates in 1997 did not differ be-
tween early and late responders or be-
tween responders and a sample of non-
responders and there was no correlation
between smoking rates and response
rates at individual schools. Further-
more, the smoking prevalence in this
study in both 1993 and 1997 is consistent
with rates found in other national sur-
veys. Using students' self-report for as-
sessment of smoking status is widely ac-
cepted because biochemical measures
have established the validity of self-re-
ported smoking status in national sur-
veys.25,26 Underreportingofsmokingsta-
tus is probably even less likely in this
survey, which focused on alcohol rather
than tobacco use. The present study ex-
aminesonly1aspectoftobaccouse,ciga-
rette smoking. Smokeless tobacco use,
also assessed in our survey, will be the
subject of a separate article. Our study
didnotassesscigaruse,whichisrisingin
adolescents.27 Hence, our results may
underestimate both the prevalence and
the increase in college students' overall
tobacco use.
These findings should be a source of
concern to those interested in reducing
tobacco use among young people. The in-
crease in smoking first seen in middle
school and high school students has
reached the college population, a group
with lower smoking rates, considered to
be the most resistant to smoking, and
with probably the greatest access to in-
formation about the effect of smoking on
health.Educationlevelisoneofthestron-

College might be an opportune time to
intervene to prevent transition from oc-
casional smoking to regular nicotine-de-

casional and regular smokers why and
how to quit. Smoking prevention has fo-

colleges should not be overlooked as
places where there is an opportunity for
smoking intervention. The national de-
bate on smoking policies, which has fo-
cused mainly on youth younger than 18
years, should be expanded to include the
college-aged population, whose future
health should be a national priority.

eral sectors is downright illegal, and university employees fall un-
der Department of Labor workplace standards and laws for their
respective states.
Universities have serious ethical and credibility problems if they
have such poor control over their employees that they cannot
promise to protect individuals from actions contrary to their own
grievance policies and that are probably illegal. Favoritism to-
ward senior faculty (eg, in the form of a university "blind eye"
to abuses) is probably a major factor in many of the problems
surrounding authorship. In a sense, it sends the message that "crime
pays."
I am also concerned that legal issues of intellectual property
were not discussed. The meaning of authorship in the academic
sense seems quite different from authorship in the legal sense.
Universities are not above the law. They are subject to US and
international laws on intellectual property, such as copyright and
patent law. These laws make it clear that only tangible, written
work is copyrightable and that the person who creates the tan-
gible expression "owns" the work (holds the copyright) unless
work-for-hire or other legal co-owner agreements apply.2
I suggest that one way to clear up the controversies over in-
tellectual property and accreditation is for universities to bring
their policies in line with the law of the land and to enforce such
policies firmly, fairly, and uniformly.

In Reply: One can agree with Dr Silverstein's sentiments with-
out necessarily coming to the same conclusions regarding the most
practical ways to address authorship problems. My own institu-
tion makes significant efforts to provide effective redress for those
who feel they have been treated unfairly in an authorship dis-
pute. Both formal grievance procedures and informal actions
(through the ombudsman's office) are available as alternatives to
normal departmental channels. Nevertheless, the reality is that
the master-journeyman-apprentice system of medical research
makes it possible for retaliation against whistle-blowing to take
place, often years later. It would be irresponsible and unfair to
state that formal procedures can guarantee complainants that there
will be no ill effects of their bringing such disputes to light.
Formal policies for redress and protection are essential tools
for promoting fair treatment. Sensitivity to legal rights and re-
quirements is very important, as Silverstein suggests, but insuf-
ficient. That is why I suggest a 3-pronged approach of formal poli-
cies, informal confidential dispute resolution tools such as an
ombudman's office, and better training of laboratory and depart-
ment heads to protect against a culture in which unfair assign-
ment of credit is tolerated.

CORRECTIONS
Incorrect Wording: In the Original Contribution entitled "Management of Pain in
Elderly Patients With Cancer" published in the June 17, 1998, issue of THE JOURNAL
(1998;280:1877-1882), there was incorrect wording in the abstract and in the text.
On page 1877, under "Results" in the abstract, the fourth sentence should have
read "Patients aged 85 years and older were less likely to receive morphine or other
strong opiates than those aged 65 to 74 years (13% vs 38%, respectively)." On
page 1880, in the first column, the last sentence should have read "Patients aged
85 years and older received morphine or other strong opiates one third less fre-
quently than patients aged 65 to 74 years (13% vs 38%, respectively; P.001)."
Author's Name Misspelled: In the A Piece of My Mind entitled "Don't Call Me
`Larry'," published in the October 28, 1998, issue of THE JOURNAL (1998;280:
1385), the author's name was misspelled. The author's name is Adrienne Reiner
Hochstadt (not Hockstadt).
Incorrect Row Headings in Table: In the Original Contribution entitled "In-
creased Levels of Cigarette Use Among College Students: A Cause for National
Concern," published in the November 18, 1998, issue of THE JOURNAL (1998;280:
1673-1678), the row headings "Public" and "Private" were inadvertently switched
in Table 5. The conditional odds ratio for public colleges should have been 1.20
(95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.29), and the conditional odds ratio for private
colleges should have been 1.00.
