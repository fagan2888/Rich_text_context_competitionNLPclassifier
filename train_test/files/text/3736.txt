Abstract
Objectives: To evaluate the association between thyroid autoantibodies and abnormalities in
thyroid function and structure, and to investigate any risk factors.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in Chengdu residents !18 years with no
previous thyroid disease. The study participants provided demographic and clinical data. Thyroid
function and serum concentrations of the thyroid autoantibodies antithyroperoxidase antibody
(TPOAb) and antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) were measured.
Results: A total of 1334 subjects were included in this study. The prevalence of TPOAb and TgAb
positivity was significantly higher in female than in male subjects. The prevalence of thyroid
autoantibodies in those with subclinical hypothyroidism and clinical hyper- and hypothyroidism was
significantly greater than in euthyroid subjects. The concentration of TPOAb and TgAb in subjects
with both TPOAb and TgAb was significantly higher than in those who exhibited only one type of
thyroid autoantibody. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, female sex, thyroid volume,
thyroid hypo- and heteroechogenicity were found to be risk factors for the presence of
autoantibodies.
Conclusions: Thyroid autoantibodies were common in the general population. Women with
thyroid enlargement, hypoechogenicity and heteroechogenicity might benefit from routine
screening for thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid function.

Introduction
Antithyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb)
and antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) are
common thyroid autoantibodies in patients
with autoimmune thyroid disease.1 Studies
have demonstrated that the serum presence
of thyroid autoantibodies is correlated with
the presence of lymphocytic infiltration and
the severity of histological thyroiditis.2,3
However, one or both of these two anti-
bodies are frequently detected in the general
population.4 A cross-sectional survey con-
ducted in areas of iodine deficiency in
Denmark, in populations with no current
or prior thyroid disease, showed that the
prevalence of serum positivity for TPOAb
and TgAb were 13.1% and 13.0%, respect-
ively.4 The National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey III (NHANES III)
study reported that TPOAb and TgAb
were present in 11.3% and 10.4%, respect-
ively, of a disease-free population.5 The
prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies varies
between populations and is influenced by
many factors including as heredity and the
environment.6,7 Environmental factors such
as iodine nutrition, age, sex and smoking
habits might influence thyroid function,
thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid struc-
ture.8­11 Although several cross-sectional
surveys have reported the prevalence of
thyroid autoantibodies,4,5 studies in China,
especially in the south-western region, have
rarely explored the prevalence of these
thyroid autoantibodies since universal salt
iodization began in 1996.
This cross-sectional survey investigated
the prevalence of serum thyroid autoanti-
bodies, and evaluated the association
between their presence and abnormalities
in thyroid function and structure, in a
Chinese population from Chengdu, China,
an area that was previously reported to be
iodine sufficient.12
Subjects and methods
Study participants
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a
Chengdu community based at Yulin
Community Health Service Centre, Wuhou
District, Chengdu, China, which is one of 10
cities in China undergoing an epidemio-
logical investigation on thyroid disease (con-
ducted by the Department of Endocrinology
and Metabolism, West China Hospital,
Sichuan University, Chengdu, China).
A total of 1500 residents !18 years of age
who had lived in Chengdu for !5 years were
invited to participate in this study, using an
age- and sex-stratified cluster sampling tech-
nique. The study sample was randomly
selected by the numbers of residential build-
ings in this Chengdu community. The cross-
sectional survey was undertaken between
December 2009 and May 2010. The exclu-
sion criteria were as follows: pregnant or
postpartum women within 1 year; subjects
taking glucocorticoids, dopamine ordobuta-
mine; subjects taking antiepileptic drugs (e.g.
phenytoin, carbamazepine); subjects with
adrenocortical insufficiency, renal insuffi-
ciency, other serious systemic disease or
chronic wasting disease; subjects
who received amiodarone or an iodine-
containing contrast agent within the previous
6 months. The study protocol was approved
by the Ethics Committee of West China
Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu,
China. All of the participants in this study
provided written informed consent.

Methods
A questionnaire was designed by the
Chinese Society of Endocrinology specific-
ally for this study in order to obtain general
personal information, including sex, age,
smoking history, history of thyroid disease
and intake of iodine supplements. The sub-
jects who were enrolled in this study
attended a clinical examination with blood-
sample collection at Yulin Community
Health Service Centre, Wuhou District,
Chengdu. Participants completed their ques-
tionnaires at home prior to the clinical
examination. Smoking status was classified
into three categories: nonsmoker, occasional
smoker (<1 cigarette per day) and frequent
smoker (!1 cigarette per day). Each sub-
jects' height, weight and blood pressure was
measured by nurses using standardized pro-
cedures. Venous blood (3 ml) was collected
after an overnight fast. After standing for
1.5 h, the blood sample was centrifuged at
704 g for 5 min at room temperature in a
medical low-speed centrifuge (Beijing
Medical Centrifuge Factory, Beijing,
China). The serum was separated and
stored at À20C until further analysis.
Thyroid ultrasonography was performed
by trained technicians using ultrasonog-
raphy equipment with a 7.5 MHz probe
(LOGIQÕ 500; GE Healthcare China,
Beijing, China). The volume of each thyroid
lobe was calculated using the formula: V
(ml) ¼ 0.479 Â width Â length Â thickness.13
The thyroid volumes consisted of the sum of
the volumes of the two lobes. Diameters of
any thyroid nodules that were identified
were measured and recorded. The thyroid
interecho classifications included isoecho-
genicity, hyperechogenicity, hypoechogeni-
city and heteroechogenicity.12
Laboratory methods
Thyroid function and thyroid autoantibo-
dies were measured using Roche
chemiluminescence immunoassay kits
(thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]: kit
no. 11731459122; free triiodothyronine
[FT3]: kit no. 03051986190; free thyroxine
[FT4]: kit no. 11731297122; TgAb: kit no.
04738578190; TPOAb: kit no. 11820818122)
and a Roche cobasÕ 6000 (e601 module)
analyser (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
The intra- and interassay coefficients of
variation were all <5%. The TPOAb,
TgAb, and TSH levels were measured in
each study participant. The serum TSH
concentration was used to evaluate thyroid
function. If TSH was <0.71 mIU/l, the FT4
and FT3 levels were also measured in the
same sample. If TSH was >6.25 mIU/l, then
only the FT4 level was measured. The
normal reference ranges of FT3, FT4 and
TSH were 3.1­6.8 pmol/l, 12.0­22.0 pmol/l
and 0.71­6.25 mIU/l, respectively. The
normal negative references for TPOAb and
TgAb were 34 IU/ml and 115 IU/ml, respect-
ively.12 The minimum detectable concentra-
tions were 0.005 mIU/l for TSH, 0.400 pmol/
l for FT3, 0.300 pmol/l for FT4, 5 IU/ml
for TPOAb and 10 IU/ml for TgAb. The
reference range of TSH was based on a
thyroid epidemiological survey of 10 cities in
China and has been demonstrated to be
suitable for Chinese populations.12
Diagnostic criteria for thyroid disease
Clinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed
when the serum TSH concentration was
>6.25 mIU/l and the serum FT4 was
<12.0 pmol/l. Subclinical hypothyroidism
was diagnosed when the serum TSH con-
centration was >6.25 mIU/l and the serum
FT4 was within the normal range. Clinical
hyperthyroidism was diagnosed when the
serum TSH concentration was <0.71 mIU/l
and the serum FT4 was >22.0 pmol/l and/or
the FT3 concentration was >6.8 pmol/l.
Subclinical hyperthyroidism was diagnosed
when the serum TSH concentration was
<0.71 mIU/l and the serum FT4 and
FT3 were within normal ranges.

Thyroid autoantibodies were regarded as
positive when the TPOAb level was >34 IU/
ml and/or the TgAb level was >115 IU/ml.
Goitre was defined as a thyroid volume
>14.4 ml for women and >18.8 ml for men.
This definition was derived from the mean
(þ2 SD) thyroid volume in 597 subjects (315
male and 282 female) with no personal or
family history of thyroid disease, with no
thyroid autoantibodies, and with an unde-
tected goitre or nodules using B-mode
ultrasonography.14
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Normally distributed data were
expressed as mean Æ SD. Not-normally dis-
tributed data were expressed as the median
and interquartile range (Q1­Q3). Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated using the
formula: BMI ¼ weight (kg)/height (m2).
Nonparametric statistical tests (Mann­
Whitney U-test or Kruskal­Wallis test)
and parametric statistical tests (Student's
t-test) were used when appropriate for
continuous variables. 2-test was used for
noncontinuous variables. Differences in the
prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies were
tested using a 2-test and the 2 trend test if
necessary. Risk factors were evaluated using
univariate and multivariate logistic regres-
sion analyses. Apart from the TPOAb
and/or TgAb levels, the following variables
were included in the models: age, sex,
smoking status, BMI, TSH concentration,
thyroid volume, thyroid nodules and thy-
roid echogenicity. The level of significance
was set at 5%. A P-value <0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 1500 residents >18 years of age
who had lived in Chengdu for !5 years were
invited to participate in this study using an
age- and sex-stratified cluster sampling tech-
nique. A total of 1334 subjects (730 female
and 604 male) with no history of thyroid
disease who completed the survey were
included in this analysis. The mean Æ SD
age of female and male subjects were
46.4 Æ 14.6 years and 44.9 Æ 15.8 years,
respectively. A total of 211 of 1334
(15.8%) of the study population had detect-
able TPOAb and/or TgAb. TPOAb alone
was positive in 154 of 1334 (11.5%) partici-
pants and TgAb alone was positive in 140 of
1334 (10.5%) participants. TPOAb and
TgAb were detected together in 6.2% (83/
1334) of the study participants. The demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of the
study participants are presented in Table 1.
Female subjects were significantly more
likely to be positive for thyroid autoantibo-
dies than male subjects (P < 0.001). In par-
ticipants with thyroid antibodies, the serum
median TSH concentration was elevated
compared with participants without antibo-
dies (TPOAb, P ¼ 0.001; TgAb, P ¼ 0.003;
TPOAb and/or TgAb, P ¼ 0.001; TPOAb
and TgAb, P ¼ 0.001). For female subjects,
the numbers of nonsmokers, occasional
smokers and frequent smokers were 704,
18 and eight, respectively. The numbers of
male subjects who were nonsmokers, occa-
sional smokers and frequent smokers were
318, 65 and 221, respectively. The prevalence
of positive thyroid autoantibodies (TPOAb
and/or TgAb) among nonsmokers was
18.2% (186/1022); and the prevalence of
positive thyroid autoantibodies (TPOAb
and/or TgAb) among smokers (occasional
and frequent) was 8.0% (25/312). Smokers
(occasional and frequent) had a significantly
lower prevalence of positive thyroid auto-
antibodies (TPOAb and/or TgAb) than
nonsmokers (P < 0.001).
The median TPOAb and TgAb concen-
trations in the 1334 subjects were 162.6 IU/
ml (interquartile range 65.1­503.1) and
396.5 (interquartile range 197.1­715.5)

IU/ml, respectively. Men exhibited a signifi-
cantly higher median concentration of TgAb
than women (593.0 IU/ml versus 368.6 IU/
ml, respectively; P ¼ 0.003); but there was no
significant difference in the median concen-
tration of TPOAb between men and women
(141.8 IU/ml versus 169.0 IU/ml, respect-
ively). The median concentration of
TPOAb in the participants with both
TPOAb and TgAb present was significantly
higher than that of the participants with
only one type of thyroid autoantibody;
this significance was also found in the
median concentration of TgAb (TPOAb
247.5 IU/ml versus 92.6 IU/ml, respectively,
P < 0.001; TgAb 447.5 IU/ml versus
340.1 IU/ml, respectively, P ¼ 0.02).
For the purpose of these analyses, the
1334 study participants were divided into
five groups based on their thyroid function:
euthyroidism (n ¼ 1209; 90.6%), clinical
hyperthyroidism (n ¼ 13; 1.0%), subclinical
hyperthyroidism (n ¼ 26; 1.9%), clinical
hypothyroidism (n ¼ 12; 0.9%) and subclin-
ical hypothyroidism (n ¼ 74; 5.5%). The
prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies
(TPOAb and/or TgAb) was 13.8%
(167/1209), 83.3% (10/12) and 76.9% (10/
13) in subjects with euthyroidism, clinical
hypothyroidism and clinical hyperthyroid-
ism, respectively. Study participants with
euthyroidism had a significantly lower
prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies
(TPOAb, TgAb, TPOAb and TgAb,
TPOAb and/or TgAb) than those with
clinical hyper-/hypothyroidism or subclin-
ical hypothyroidism (all P < 0.05; data
not shown). A significant difference in
the prevalence of both TPOAb and TgAb
positivity was found between the
euthyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroid-
ism groups (TPOAb and TgAb, P ¼ 0.039;
data not shown). The prevalence of thyroid
nodules in the 1334 study participants
was 16.9% (225/1334) and no significant
differences were found using the subgroup
analysis.
Using a univariate logistic regression
model, age, female sex, being a frequent
smoker, TSH level, thyroid volume, thy-
roid goitre, hypoechogenicity and hetero-
echogenicity were found to be risk
factors for thyroid autoantibody positivity
(Table 2). In the multivariate logistic regres-
sion analysis, the final model retained the
following variables: female sex, thyroid
volume, hypoechogenicity and heteroecho-
genicity. The risk of TPOAb positivity
increased significantly with an elevated
TSH concentration, however, the risk
was not significant between TgAb and the
TSH level.
The numbers of subjects classified as
having isoechogenicity, hyperechogenicity,
heteroechogenicity and hypoechogenicity
were 1157, 11, 48 and 118, respectively.
Study participants with thyroid hypoecho-
genicity were divided into five groups
according to their TPOAb and TgAb con-
centrations. Individuals who were negative
for both TPOAb and TgAb were placed
in group 0; groups 1­4 were divided by
quartiles of thyroid autoantibody-positive
concentrations. The hypoechogenicity sub-
group analysis showed that regardless of
whether the subject was TgAb positive or
not, the prevalence of thyroid hypoecho-
genicity increased with increasing concen-
trations of TPOAb (TgAb positive,
P < 0.001, 2 trend test; TgAb negative,
P < 0.001, 2 trend test; data not shown).
In addition, there was a trend towards an
increased prevalence of thyroid hypoecho-
genicity with an elevated concentration of
TgAb, regardless of the TPOAb concentra-
tion (TPOAb negative, P < 0.001, 2 trend
test; TPOAb positive, P ¼ 0.001, 2
trend test; data not shown). In total, a
trend towards an increased prevalence of
thyroid hypoechogenicity with elevated
levels of TPOAb and TgAb was observed
in this study (TPOAb, P < 0.001, 2 trend
test; TgAb, P < 0.001, 2 trend test; data not
shown).

Discussion
Consistent with previous research, in the
present study, thyroid autoantibodies were
significantly more prevalent in female than
in male participants in a cohort (n ¼ 1334)
with no history of thyroid disease.4,5,15
Furthermore, the current study detected a
significantly greater serum median TSH
concentration in tparticipants who were
positive for thyroid autoantibodies com-
pared with those who were negative.
A significant association was demonstrated
between an elevated TSH level and the
presence of thyroid autoantibodies.16
Although this current cross-sectional study
did not show a risk for the participants with
positive thyroid autoantibodies developing
either subclinical or clinical hypothyroidism,
such a progression has been reported in a
longitudinal study.17 In addition, for euthyr-
oid individuals with positive autoantibodies
at baseline, those who developed hypothy-
roidism in the follow-up study had signifi-
cantly higher baseline TSH levels than those
who remained euthyroid.15 This current

study also found that, in serum containing
both TPOAb and TgAb, the median con-
centrations of autoantibodies were signifi-
cantly higher than in serum containing only
one type of autoantibody. The presence of
one antigen might enhance the concentra-
tion of the other antigen in the immune
system, or the reactivity of the immune
system against thyroid antigens when
both autoantibodies are present may be
enhanced.
In the current study, the prevalence of
thyroid autoantibodies was as high as 83.3%
and 76.9% in subjects with clinical hypo-
thyroidism and clinical hyperthyroidism,
respectively. Significant differences were
observed in the prevalence of positive thy-
roid autoantibodies between euthyroid sub-
jects and those with thyroid dysfunction.
Previous studies observed that thyroid
autoantibodies were involved in thyroid
abnormalities.18­20 The presence of TPOAb
and TgAb was associated with lymphocytic
infiltration in NOD.H-2h4 mice.21 This
association suggests that TPOAb and
TgAb may play an important role in the
pathogenesis of thyroid abnormalities.
Several studies have suggested that TPOAb
could induce antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity, and that concentra-
tions of TPOAb might correlate with
severity of thyroid lymphocytic infiltration,
regardless of the presence or absence of
hypothyroidism.18,22,23 The antibody to
thyroglobulin (Tg) could facilitate the for-
mation of complement-activating Tg/TgAb
complexes.24 Patients with high-avidity
TgAb might be at a high risk of developing
subclinical and clinical hypothyroidism.25
However, the positive rate for thyroid
TPOAb and/or TgAb was 13.8% in euthyr-
oid subjects in the present study. A longitu-
dinal study in China found that the
prevalence of abnormal thyroid function,
especially hypothyroidism, in euthyroid sub-
jects with positive antibodies at baseline,
either alone or combined (TgAb and/or
TPOAb), was much higher than in euthyroid
subjects who were antibody negative after
5 years.15 Populations positive for thyroid
autoantibodies may be at a high risk of
abnormal thyroid function.17 A routine
examination of thyroid function in individ-
uals with positive thyroid autoantibodies
may be necessary and is suggested, based on
these current findings.
The univariate and multivariate logistic
analyses in the present study revealed that
female sex was a risk factor for TPOAb and
TgAb positivity. A previous study showed
that presence of thyroid autoantibodies was
significantly associated with female sex.16
Female sex was reported to be a risk factor
for TgAb positivity.15 Cross-sectional26 and
longitudinal27 studies found that the preva-
lence of thyroid autoantibodies was higher
in subjects with thyroid goitres than in those
without thyroid goitres. In the Whickham
Survey follow-up study,17 patients who had
developed a goitre had also developed thy-
roid autoantibodies. However, findings of
the current study showed that thyroid
goitres were not in the final multivariate
analysis. In addition, thyroid volume was a
risk factor for the presence of thyroid
autoantibodies in the current study, both
in the univariate and multivariate logistic
regression analyses. A study undertaken in
people with elevated TSH demonstrated
that there was a strong association between
thyroid autoantibodies and an enlarged
thyroid.28 In hypothyroidism patients, a
high level of autoantibodies (TPOAb and/
or TgAb) was significantly associated with
thyroid enlargement: patients with thyroid
enlargement had the highest values of both
TPOAb and TgAb.29 In another study,
antibody-positive subjects had larger thy-
roid volumes than control subjects.30
Various associations may exist between
thyroid autoantibodies, thyroid volume
and goitres. TgAb formation might reduce
the level of Tg, and low Tg levels maximize
growth-promotion activity and induction of
Yan et al. 419
the apical iodide transporter, which stimu-
lates follicular cell growth.31 In addition, the
co-ordinated actions of TSH and insulin/
insulin-like growth factor-1 signalling might
regulate thyroid cell growth.32,33
Thyroid hypoechogenicity was reported
to be involved in thyroid autoimmune
inflammation and lymphocytic infiltra-
tion.34 Thyroid hypo- and heteroechogeni-
city were found to be highly indicative of
autoimmune thyroiditis.35 In the current
study, thyroid hypoechogenicity and hetero-
echogenicity were risk factors for thyroid
autoantibody positivity. The prevalence of
hypoechoic thyroid increased with elevated
concentrations of TPOAb and TgAb.
Hypoechogenicity and heteroechogenicity
were associated with significantly higher
levels of TPOAb activity and were indicative
of a high level of autoimmune inflammatory
activity of the thyroid gland.36 A close
relationship between the heteroechogenicity
of the thyroid gland and TPOAb was
reported in euthyroid patients with
Hashimoto's thyroiditis before the hetero-
echogenicity became distinguishable from
normal thyroid glands.37
How smoking affects thyroid auto-
immunity remains controversial. The
NHANES III study found that the preva-
lence of thyroid autoantibodies was lower in
smokers than in nonsmokers.5 A significant
negative association was observed between
smoking and the presence of TPOAb and
TgAb.38 Furthermore, a prospective study
reported that smoking cessation might
increase the risk of TPOAb and TgAb
positivity.39 Similarly, the current study
demonstrated that the prevalence of
TPOAb and/or TgAb positivity was lower
in smokers (occasional and frequent) than in
nonsmokers. In addition, using univariate
logistic regression analysis, being a frequent
smoker was a protective factor for positive
TPOAb and TgAb (TPOAb: odds ratio
[OR] 0.52, P ¼ 0.033; TgAb: OR 0.15,
P < 0.001). However, smoking was not in
the final model of the multivariate logistic
analysis. In the current study, BMI was a
risk factor for TPOAb positivity, but not for
TgAb, in the univariate logistic regression
analysis; however, BMI was not in the final
model of the multivariate analysis. The
prevalence of positive thyroid autoantibo-
dies was increased in obese children, par-
ticularly in those with elevated TSH.40
Obese patients had a higher frequency of
antithyroid antibodies than control
patients.40 The prevalence of TPOAb posi-
tivity was greater in the obese group in a
cross-sectional study undertaken in 165
obese and 118 lean subjects.41 This finding
may be due to increased antigen presenta-
tion by amplified thyroid stimulation, or it
may be associated with another factor, such
as the leptin level.41 Future studies are
needed to understand how obesity might
enhance the risk of thyroid autoimmunity.
The current investigation had a number
of limitations. First, the study did not
include subjects <18 years of age.
Secondly, the study was cross-sectional and
hence did not investigate individual changes
over time. Thirdly, laboratory tests assessing
FT4 and/or FT3 were only performed in
subjects with abnormal TSH levels.
In conclusion, female sex, thyroid
volume, thyroid hypoechogenicity and het-
eroechogenicity were risk factors for the
presence of the thyroid autoantibodies
TPOAb and TgAb. Thyroid autoantibodies
were detected in subjects with thyroid dys-
function and in those who were euthyroid.
An increased prevalence of thyroid hypoe-
chogenicity correlated with elevated levels of
TPOAb and TgAb. The presence of thyroid
autoantibodies was indicative of auto-
immune thyroiditis. Smoking may be a
protective factor for the presence of
TPOAb and TgAb. Women with thyroid
enlargement, thyroid hypoechogenicity and
heteroechogenicity would benefit from rou-
tine evaluation of thyroid autoantibody
status and thyroid function.
