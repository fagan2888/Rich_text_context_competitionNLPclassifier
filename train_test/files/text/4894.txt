Introduction
Triggered in large part by the work of Stouffer (1955), the
concept of political tolerance has received a great deal of
scholarly attention. Considerable thought has been devoted
to uncovering the antecedents of tolerance and intolerance
(Marcus, Sullivan, Theiss-Morse, & Wood, 1995), the conse-
quences of tolerant and intolerant attitudes, and trends over
time (Gibson, 2006, 2008, 2010; McClosky & Brill, 1983;
Mondak & Sanders, 2003). The literature has been enriched
by studies of attitudes toward specific target groups (Gibson,
1987, 1992; Peffley & Sigelman, 1990; Stouffer, 1955) and
particular historical context (Davis, 2004; Gibson, 1988); the
influence of religion on political tolerance (Eisenstein,
2006); better conceptualization and measurement of the key
social, political, and psychological predictors of tolerance
(D. W. Davis & Silver, 2004; Hurwitz & Mondak, 2002;
Marcus et al., 1995; Peffley, Knigge, & Hurwitz, 2001); in-
depth examination of personality factors (Marcus et al.,
1995; Stenner, 2005); the role of threat perceptions (D. W.
Davis & Silver, 2004; Gibson & Gouws, 2003); experimen-
tal designs (Gibson, 1998; Marcus et al., 1995); and method-
ological research (Gibson, 1992; Mondak & Sanders, 2003).
Although the earliest studies made substantial progress in
the effort to understand the levels and sources of political
tolerance and support for democratic values (Bobo & Licari,
1989; Gibson, 1992; Golebiowska, 1995; Lipset, 1959;
Marcus et al., 1995; Mondak & Sanders, 2003; Nunn,
Crockett, & Williams, 1978; Stouffer, 1955; Sullivan,
Piereson, & Marcus, 1979, 1982), not much is known about
the stability of political intolerance attitudes over an indi-
vidual's lifetime. In large part, this is because existing stud-
ies rely on the standard tolerance battery contained in the
General Social Survey (GSS) that might be adequate for
cross-sectional research but is deficient for longitudinal anal-
ysis (Gibson, 1992) and in particular, differentiating social
change stemming from age, period, and/or cohort effects. To
address this problem, our research draws on a national U.S.
multiple-generation, four-wave panel study stretching from
1965 to 1997 to investigate the interrelationship of social,
political, and psychological characteristics with intolerance
over the life course that has important implications for our
understanding of the sources and consequences of political
tolerance.
Although considerable thought has been devoted to
uncovering time trends in tolerance, these prior studies have
relied on cross-sectional data that are incapable of uncover-
ing changes in tolerance stemming from the replacement of
individuals as opposed to individuals changing how they
think (Firebaugh, 1989). Of special concern is the question
of "why" changes in opinions occur, and the present study

Stability and Change: Intolerance
of Communists
April K. Clark1, Michael Clark2, and Marie A. Eisenstein3
Abstract
Ever since Stouffer began to measure political tolerance a half century ago, multiple studies have shown that a number of
social, psychological, and political characteristics play a significant role in influencing whether individuals want to extend civil
liberties to fringe groups. However, less is known about the stability of tolerance attitudes over an individual's lifetime. To
address this problem, our research draws on a national U.S. multiple-generation, four-wave panel study stretching from 1965
to 1997. The intuitive appeal of the approach used in this study is to advance theoretical accounts for variations in political
intolerance irrespective of generational placement, life cycle, and differences in the political context. Specifically, the panel
design encourages an effort to examine the relative impact of the social, political, and psychological predictors on intolerance
over time and across the same individuals, and to assess the consequences of how changes in these determinants affect some
of our most fundamental hypotheses about the origins of these attitudes.

examines certain facets of this question. Thus, this research,
unlike most studies in the subfield, relies on lengthy panel
data to identify the origins of political intolerance by the
same individuals, and across three lineage generations (see
Appendix A for wave panel summary). From this vantage
point, it is possible to compare the political intolerance atti-
tudes of today with those of the past, and as a result, it is
possible to speak confidently about trends in intolerance that
result from life cycle, generational, or period effects. The
evidence can be used to enlighten the debate about the
dynamics that are associated with intergenerational mainte-
nance, acquisition, and reduction of intolerant beliefs.
A second objective is to see how well Sullivan, Marcus,
Feldman, and Piereson's (1981) model of generic tolerance
would perform when applied to the narrower question of the
sources of intolerance toward a specific civil liberties dis-
pute: allowing a suspected communist the opportunity to run
for elected office. Although a number of studies examine
"focused intolerance" toward specific target groups, none
uses longitudinal data and so are limited in their ability to
examine the relative impact of the key predictors on one's
willingness to extend civil liberties over time. Because a
strategy employed here is to determine whether the genera-
tions are more alike or unalike, and why, we examine the
influence of the social, psychological, and political predic-
tors and the presence of intolerance for each generation. Of
importance here is the extent to which changes in an indi-
vidual's environment may create instability in attitudes, and
which environmental factors significantly contribute to the
change.
Not surprisingly, Stouffer's (1955) benchmark study dis-
covered great intolerance among theAmerican public toward
communists, socialists, and atheists in the 1950s. However,
as documented by the work of Nunn et al. (1978), intolerance
toward communists had dropped considerably by the 1970s.
The impact of this seminal study led many scholars to con-
clude that tolerance in general, not just toward communists,
in America had increased. Yet, Mondak and Sanders (2003)
claimed that the increase in tolerance was not wholly the
consequence of a general increase but in part reflective of
changes in group-specific attitudes. While it may well be the
case that communists were the least-liked group for most
Americans in the 1950s, that was coupled with high levels of
intolerance for that particular group, the political context of
that time period was substantially different from the one that
prevailed in the 1970s. It was argued, that most Americans
were still willing to deny political rights to disliked groups in
the 1970s; it was just that Americans' dislike of communists
had fallen (Sullivan et al., 1979, 1982).
The advantage of our approach is that it can explore the
impact of important contextual factors that condition an indi-
vidual's intolerance toward communists spanning a 32-year
period. It is not possible to obtain these results in prior stud-
ies and consequently, our findings shed new light on the vari-
ous ways these variables influence intolerance in a given
context. In this way, investigating "focused intolerance"
toward a specific group provides a stringent "test" of the
generalizability of the sources of intolerance to a very differ-
ent history era and political context (Peffley & Sigelman,
1990, p. 95).
The results of this research, thus, present both unique and
valuable contributions to the study of political tolerance. In
short, we move beyond the common approach of focusing on
why aggregations of individual attitudes vary over time and
across cohorts and instead explain why attitudes vary across
individuals. Unlike other studies of political tolerance, we
have the added advantage of "before" and "after" measures
and lengthy panel data. Specifically, the research design
encourages an effort to examine the relative impact of the
predictors to intolerance for allowing a suspected communist
to hold public office and to assess the consequences of how
changes in these determinants affect some of our most funda-
mental hypotheses about the origins of intolerance.
Given the importance of intolerance from both a scholarly
(Peffley & Sigelman, 1990) and a historical perspective
within the United States, the ability to study the determinants
of intolerance toward communists across time by the same
individuals provides a unique opportunity to help us under-
stand attitudinal stability and discontinuity including the
sources of change. Because we know very little about how
stable intolerance beliefs are, and the extent to which the pre-
dictors are relevant over an individual's life course, the
objective here is to provide a long-term examination that
explores age, period, and cohort variations in a specific civil
liberties dispute. By considering attitude change in trends for
whether a suspected communist should be able to hold public
office, we contribute both to the literature on tolerance and
on social change more broadly.
Key Concept
Political Tolerance
People are tolerant to the extent that they are willing to grant
the full rights of citizenship uniformly and without excep-
tion. The general literature on democracy and political toler-
ance suggests one requirement is a dedication to the "rules of
the democratic game and a willingness to apply them
equally" (Sullivan et al., 1982, p. 2). It follows that people
are intolerant provided that they advocate any restriction of
political acts that are otherwise permissible under law (Bobo
& Licari, 1989; Lawrence, 1976; McClosky & Brill, 1983;
Mondak & Sanders, 2003, 2005; Sniderman, Brody, &
Tetlock, 1991); that is, any deviation from the commitment
to the rights and liberties of others reflects some degree of
intolerance (Bobo & Licari, 1989; Lawrence, 1976;
McClosky & Brill, 1983; Mondak & Sanders, 2003).
Therefore, persons are considered intolerant to the extent
that they are prepared to refuse the legally recognized right to
run for office. Although there is no constitutional right to hold
Clark et al. 3
public office per se, there is support in extant research (e.g.,
Bobo & Licari, 1989; Cigler & Joslyn, 2002; Mondak &
Sanders, 2003) suggesting such a measure is pertinent to toler-
ance in the sense that it implicitly taps into a fundamental right
guaranteed in a democracy. Tolerance requires that individuals
respect the right of people to express different views, and the
denial of the right to seek office to members of ideological
groups directly violates their right "to try to win majority sup-
port for their opinions" (Prothro & Grigg, 1960, p. 283). Thus,
denying a suspected communist the opportunity to hold elected
office unequivocally measures intolerance.
The earliest empirical study of tolerance (Stouffer, 1955)
utilized a similar measure designed to examine the extent to
which Americans were prepared to extend procedural rights
to groups on the left. It should come as no surprise that in the
1950s, communists were cited as one of the most commonly
disliked groups in America. As such, virtually all Americans
supported depriving admitted communists of at least some of
their political and civil liberties (Stouffer, 1955).1 Although
opposition to communists may have decreased since the
1950s, recent research suggests that they remain on the radar
of most Americans and are not well liked in the United
States. Using data from 2005, Gibson (2008) found that com-
munists rank as the sixth most commonly disliked groups in
America today, with about one in five Americans putting
communists on their list of the three most disliked groups.
Moreover, only 5.2% of the respondents expressed any
degree of positive affect toward communists as compared
with the 73.4% who disliked them. In short, it is clear that
there still remains a considerable amount of animus toward
communists in the United States.
Age­Period­Cohort
In our approach, it is possible to compare the political intol-
erance attitudes of three generations over time and as a result,
it is possible to identify continuity and discontinuity arising
from generational effects, life-cycle effects, and period
effects. A cohort explanation argues that differences in atti-
tudes are due to the social and cultural climate prevailing so
that members of a generation share the same formative
experiences, distinctive from the experiences of their adja-
cent counterparts (Jennings & Niemi, 1981; Mannheim,
1928/1972). Thus, the historical period and the nature of the
political times shape the youth's first political experiences
that influence them for a lifetime. In contrast, an age or life-
cycle explanation argues that distinctive patterns in attitudes
are due to position in the life cycle (Mayer, 1992); that is,
respondents, regardless of cohort placement, will have simi-
lar attitudes while in their youth, middle age, or when elderly.
It is also possible however, that political climate affects the
public at large so that attitudinal changes reflect period
effects. Period or historical effects have a roughly common
impact on all or most segments of society (Mannheim,
1928/1972).
There have been many suggestions in the literature that
younger people typically are more tolerant than older people.
This was originally attributed to a life-cycle effect, that is,
the tendency for people to become less tolerant as they age
(Sears, 1983; Stouffer, 1955). But more recent studies have
found no evidence of this aging effect and indicate instead a
generational effect so that recent cohorts are not only more
tolerant than earlier cohorts but tend to remain so as they
grow older (e.g., Cutler & Kaufman, 1975; Davis, 1975;
Wilson, 1994). Overall, the picture emerging is one where
tolerance attitudes are invariably the result of generational
rather than life-cycle effects; because of their particular
research design, however, these studies cannot answer ques-
tions such as why individuals may be more tolerant as com-
pared with similarly situated individuals in the previous or
later generation, or how those tolerant and intolerant attitudes
develop and change over the life cycle.
The basic problem in assessing age, period, and cohort
effects is that two of the basic effects (either age and cohort,
period and cohort, or age and period) are confounded. When
older persons are shown to be more conservative than
younger persons, this may result from aging but also from
the confounding effects of cohort (generational) differences
in socialization. Thus, any inferences about the effect of age
changes on political attitudes derived from cross-sectional
studies must be viewed with considerable reservation. Unlike
other studies of political tolerance, we have the advantage of
lengthy panel data.
In the following section, we will begin with a discussion
of several hypotheses regarding explanations of individual
change and a review of evidence pertaining to several central
issues that arise from these hypotheses. The main question is
to what extent, age, cohort, period, and individual character-
istics contribute to the longitudinal explanation of intoler-
ance regarding the right of a suspected communist to hold
public office? This discussion provides the theoretical basis
for our presentation of findings. Next, we will describe the
data and measures used to test these hypotheses. In the final
section, we will present and discuss the results of our
analyses.
Explanations of Change
In comparing generations with each other and with them-
selves over time, one must be aware of four types of phe-
nomena: (a) continuity and discontinuity as a function of (b)
life-cycle effects, (c) generational effects, and (d) period
effects. It is important to distinguish between these three pro-
cesses, because each has important and differing implica-
tions for the shape of intolerant opinions.
Hypotheses
There have been many suggestions in the literature that age
or life-cycle processes are important to attitude formation
4 SAGE Open
and change. Life-cycle effects represent differences attribut-
able to aging-related developmental changes in the life
course. In the "conventional lifecycle effects model" the
research should demonstrate movement by the younger gen-
eration to the older one in which change in the older genera-
tion has stopped (Jennings & Stoker, 2004). Accordingly, our
first hypothesis is as follows:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): If intolerance represents a life-cycle
effect, age-related patterns and changes will be marked by
the younger cohort (Gen 2) showing similar intolerance of
a communist officeholder as the parent cohort (Gen 1) at
the same point in the life cycle.2
A related argument is the "age-stability hypothesis" that
claims that people change their minds little as they age
(Alwin & Krosnick, 1991; Lorence & Mortimer, 1985). This
hypothesis has been supported with respect to many social
attitudes (see, for example, Cutler & Kaufman, 1975; Davis,
1992; Firebaugh & Davis, 1988; Wilson, 1994). The asser-
tion is that as individuals' age and move through various
stages of life, their attitudes become more stable over time.
The stability grows out of a learning process marked by
habituation and hardening through exposure and usage
(Jennings & Markus, 1984). If the fact that attitude inconsis-
tency is more prone to occur in the young, but as the indi-
vidual ages, attitude stability increases, then the evidence
suggests that there is a highly formative stage in young adult-
hood after which time the person becomes more resistant to
environmental pressures that affect attitude change.
Given these considerations, our second hypothesis is for-
mulated as follows:
Hypothesis 2 (H2): The second generation, given its
position in the life cycle, will exhibit less aggregate attitu-
dinal stability than their parents.
However, as the younger cohort ages and life experiences
change less, the expectation is that political intolerance atti-
tudes will become increasingly stable up through middle age.
The assumption is that as they pass through time, the young
will demonstrate similar levels of attitudinal stability to that
of their parents (or at least to the point at which the older
generation was when it was in that age bracket).
In contrast, a generational explanation argues that differ-
ences in attitudes are due to the social and cultural climate
prevailing so that members of a generation share the same
experiences, distinctive from the experiences of their adja-
cent counterparts (Jennings & Niemi, 1981; Mannheim,
1928/1972). A generational effect exists when a specific age
cohort is uniquely socialized by a set of historical events.
The usual assumption is that certain events in history make
an indelible imprint on the young, whereas older individuals
are better equipped to resist its influence by their previous
life experiences. Studies of young adults during the volatile
1960s (e.g., Sears & McConahay, 1973) found that new envi-
ronments induced new political orientations.
There are valid reasons for expecting generational differ-
ences for intolerance. It has often been suggested that because
of the unique experiences with communism during their
impressionable years, the parent generation will be more
intolerant whereas their offspring (Gen 2), whose formative
political experiences consisted of the Civil Rights Movement
and the Vietnam War, will hold less repressive tendencies. In
particular, it is believed that the younger generation, having
reached adolescence during "the 1960s" will carry with them
a permanent "liberal" tilt that could have serious conse-
quences for political intolerance (J. A. Davis, 2004).
If correct, we hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 3 (H3): The second generation is least likely
to display political intolerance.
Related, we also surmise that intolerance should follow
the expected route, and so we contend the following:
Hypothesis 4 (H4): The most recent cohort (Gen 3, chil-
dren born of the second generation) should exhibit less
intolerance than their grandparents (Gen 1) but more
intolerance than their parents (Gen 2), the young adults of
the 1960s.
From this perspective, the unique events occurring in the
1960s-1970s set the political tolerance orientations of the
second generation apart from their parents and children.
Evidence, however, suggests that strong political shocks
can affect young and old alike and leave a permanent
imprint on one's attitudes and opinions. In situations where
the effects of contemporary societal circumstances reflect a
more uniform change, regardless of age, we tend to classify
them as period effects. Period effects can produce both
individual and aggregate change, often quickly and endur-
ingly, without any age-related differences. The sharp drop
in trust in government between 1965 and 1975, for exam-
ple, was almost entirely this sort of period effect, as
Americans of all ages changed their minds about their lead-
ers' trustworthiness.3
We can also expect some period effects. The third set of
arguments suggests that there will be a gradual improvement
for both Gen 1 and Gen 2 over time as the context in the
country has gradually changed. Since the 1950s, intolerance
of communists has waned considerably (see Nunn et al.,
1978). During the late 1960s and early 1970s, extreme hostil-
ity toward the Soviet Union and communists began to soften
somewhat and polls showed less opposition to communism
and greater tolerance for allowing a communist to speak in
public (Mayer, 1992). However, the 1980s ushered in a
period of conservatism that rose to dominance when Ronald
Reagan became president and was accompanied by a belief
that the Soviet Union was not just unfriendly but an enemy.
Clark et al. 5
To the extent that intolerance is shaped by historical events,
we hypothesize as follows:
Hypothesis 5 (H5): Both Generations 1 and 2 should
assign a similar priority to allowing a communist to run
for public office, witnessed as parallel shifts in political
intolerance.
In sum, the longitudinal design provides the opportunity
to explore the extent to which new generations of people
enter the electorate and bring with them different life experi-
ences that can be expected to influence political attitudes dif-
ferently than previous generations. Alternatively, the basis of
the explanation may be found in the aging process itself--
when environments become increasingly unstable in the pre-
adult years (as individuals complete education, enter
marriage, the workforce, or the military, for example), they
may have more reasons to shift their attitudes and orienta-
tions as they grow older (Lorence & Mortimer, 1985).
Sources of Political Tolerance
The earliest empirical studies (e.g., Stouffer, 1955) identified
individual-level factors that appear to enhance or impede
political tolerance, including political, psychological, and
social background variables. Indeed, education, age, religi-
osity (including church attendance and one's interpretation
of the Bible), social status, gender, race, political ideology,
interpersonal trust, party identification, political knowledge,
and region have all been identified in the literature as
important antecedents of tolerance.4 Realistically, we
expect to find that the impact of the predictors should work
to differentiate members within a cohort and across cohorts
(e.g., Jennings, 2002; Nie, Junn, & Stehlik-Barry, 1996;
Sullivanarcus, 1982).
Because the bases of intolerance appear to vary with a
number of possible influences, the present design provides
the opportunity to examine the direct effect of each of the
predictors, and to also examine whether the relationship is
consistent across generations and time.
Data
To assess the effect of age, birth, and year on changes in
intolerance, we rely on the Youth­Parent Socialization Panel
Study, 1965-1997, collected by Jennings and Niemi (1981;
see also Jennings, Markus, & Niemi [and Stoker]).5 The
long-term political socialization project was compiled from
interviews with a national probability sample of 1,669 high
school seniors from the graduating class of 1965, and when
possible, at least from one parent. Of the high school sample,
a total of 935 individuals were resurveyed in 1973, 1982, and
1997, resulting in an unadjusted retention rate of 56% across
the 32 years. The three-wave parent panel consists of 898
respondents from an original sample of 1,562, for an adjusted
retention rate of 57%. For ease of understanding and to avoid
awkward labeling, the high school senior class is identified
as Gen 2 or G2 and their parents as Gen 1 or G1.
Additional data consist of interviews in 1997 with Gen 2
and their offspring (Gen 3 or G3), aged 15 and above. Self-
administered questionnaires were received from 778 of the
1,435 offspring (G3) aged 15 and older, for a response rate of
54%. The availability of data for G2 and their offspring (G3)
in 1997 provides the additional opportunity to explore the
extent to which intolerant beliefs in the previous generation
are reflected in the next.6
However, less attention will be paid to contrasting the
second generation with their children (e.g., contrasting G2
with G3). The absence of additional observations prevents us
from knowing whether the patterns continue as the genera-
tions age, and process historical experiences and social
change. The offspring generation is particularly problematic
because discontinuity is more likely to occur within G3 as
they confront frequent disruptions--such as getting married,
having children, deciding on a profession--that are associ-
ated with the aging process.
Dependent Variable
Whereas tolerance presupposes that the individual dislikes
the group or groups in question, people are intolerant pro-
vided that they advocate any restriction of political acts that
are otherwise permissible under law.7 Because opposition to
communists cannot be determined with the socialization
data set, our dependent variable taps intolerance toward
communists rather than tolerance. To create the measure of
intolerance of communists, we counted the number of "dis-
agree" or "don't know" answers.8 Thus, respondents are
considered intolerant to the extent they express ambivalence
or a willingness to deny office-holding privileges to sus-
pected communists.
Of course, if the purpose of this research was to track
trends in tolerance attitudes or measure the extent of generic
intolerance in the United States, a simple dichotomy respond-
ing to a single question certainly constitutes a poor strategy.
Our objective, however, is to provide a more focused inves-
tigation of intolerance and how the antecedents of political
intolerance affect the suppression of communist officehold-
ers across a substantial time frame of an individual's life-
time. By focusing on the "disagree/don't know" responses to
holding office, a right that is codified by law, this represents
a valid measure of one specific manifestation of the phenom-
enon. This dichotomous conceptualization of tolerance ver-
sus intolerance is supported in the literature (on this point,
see Mondak & Sanders, 2003).
Moreover, as noted in the introduction to this article,
Gibson (2008) found that much of the American public still
expresses some antipathy toward communists suggesting
that the issue of extending freedoms, such as allowing a
suspected communist to run for elected office, would be
6 SAGE Open
considered offensive by many. That is, Gibson (2008) dem-
onstrated that communists remain a highly disliked group
by most Americans and that a bit more than 50% of
Americans would be willing to ban a demonstration by
communists. More importantly, the level of antipathy and
intolerance toward communists in contemporary America
is similar to that toward other groups, such as Radical
Muslims and Atheists. So although the proclivity for intol-
erance of communists may have waned since the 1950s, the
unwillingness to extend freedoms to communists remains
pervasive among most Americans. Because communists
continue to be one of the least-liked groups toward which
Americans hold high levels of antipathy and intolerance,
the sole measure utilized here provides for a more focused
investigation of intolerance toward communists spanning a
substantial period of American history. However, given that
Americans rank communists similar to other target groups
considered more salient in contemporary society, we expect
our analysis to contribute to a better understanding of the
roots of intolerance that does not refer to any specific target
group.
Method
Finally, a quick word about the statistical analyses we use in
this research. To examine the questions posed earlier, this
study will use quantitative methodology using two levels of
analysis--individual and aggregate. The aggregate purpose
is to demonstrate continuity/discontinuity as well as to high-
light differences in attitudes at similar ages. The individual
approach will attempt to explain the reasons for these pat-
terns by assessing the effects of the social, psychological,
and political determinants on tolerance attitudes.
Comparisons based on the occurrence of the predictors may
shed light on the importance of each factor for attitude for-
mation, including whether the impact is dependent on the
relative or absolute occurrence of the predictor. Moreover,
we can compare how changes in these factors result in modi-
fications of intolerant opinions.
As the dependent variable is dichotomous, we have used
probit9 models to estimate the effects of the predictors on
intolerance for communists to hold public office for each
panel wave. The tolerance item is coded so that 1 indicates
an intolerant response. The social, psychological, and politi-
cal determinants were coded using dummy variables with
"1" representing the presence of a particular characteristic,
and "0" representing the absence of the characteristic. To
avoid perfect collinearity in the model, cases where the val-
ues of the independent variable consisted of three or more
categories, such as party identification, one value was used
as the baseline measure in the model. The political knowl-
edge and interpersonal trust predictors are indexes created by
combining several questions with larger numbers represent-
ing greater knowledge or trust, respectively (see Appendix B
for question wording).
Findings
To more clearly illustrate the results of our analyses, the fol-
lowing section is divided into three subheadings pertaining
to the main effects we examine: "Life-Cycle Effects,"
"Generational Effects," and "Period Effects."
Life-Cycle Effects
Our first hypothesis stated that if intolerance was defined by
a life-cycle effect, then age-related patterns and changes
would manifest themselves in the form of Gen 2 showing
similar intolerance as Gen 1 (their parents) at the same point
in the life cycle. Examining the percentage differences
reported in Table 1, at the aggregate level, we find little evi-
dence to support H1--as Gen 2 aged the percentage report-
ing intolerance of a communist taking office did not move
closer in line with the previous generation, an expected pat-
tern associated with a life-stage explanation. Indeed, the gap
between Gen 1 and Gen 2 widens from an initial percentage
difference of 9 points in 1965 to 19 points in 1973, and basi-
cally remaining at this level beyond.
These findings also suggest that attitudes toward electing
a communist to public office were an exception to the stan-
dard "age-stability" hypothesis (H2), which claims that opin-
ions on controversial social issues are formed by early
adulthood and change little with age. The increase in the con-
tinuity coefficients reported in Table 2 is similar for the first
and second generations over the period 1965-1973 (.37 and
.33, respectively; for a reporting of the consistency of
responses for each wave of data as compared with the next,
see Appendix C).10 That the aggregate movement was not
exclusive to the younger generation provides support for the
lifelong-openness theory, which emphasizes that lifelong
changes can occur.
However, as the continuity coefficients in Table 2 sug-
gest, the second generation, after experiencing more attitudi-
nal fluctuations as it came of age, appears to become more
stable by middle age. The addition of a third time period
demonstrates that these gains tended to remain very much in
place--particularly impressive given the much longer time
span represented by the third period. In contrast, however,
the continuity coefficients reported in Table 2 also suggest

that the older cohort was somewhat more likely than the
young to adhere to their earlier attitudes, and because the
"nature of the times" affected the younger cohorts more, this
differential propensity led to a widening gap in tolerance
between the generations. We therefore find little evidence
supporting H2--that the second generation's position in the
life cycle will exhibit less aggregate attitudinal stability than
their parents.
Generational Effects
With regard to H3, which states that Gen 2 is least likely to
display political intolerance, the figures reported in Table 1
strongly suggest that being socialized during the Vietnam
War­Civil Rights era was quite a different experience from
being raised before or after that time period. Coming of age
during this time of tumult, as the 1960s generation did, appears
to have had the effect of rendering the group as strong advo-
cates for upholding the rights of communists--especially
when compared with both previous and later generations who
were not exposed to such a unique combination of events and
changes. Thus, we obtain evidence in support of H3.
Related to this finding, we also find support for our fourth
hypothesis, which also explores generational dynamics and
states that the most recent cohort (Gen 3) will exhibit less
intolerance than their grandparents (Gen 1) but more intoler-
ance than their parents (Gen 2), who came of age during the
1960s. We can see that the disparity in tolerance opinions
extends to Gen 2 and their offspring, and with three genera-
tions to examine, there is evidence of differential experiences
as demonstrated in intergenerational gaps. Examining the
percentages reported in Table 1, a wide gulf favoring Gen 2
exists that is reminiscent of the contrasts between Gen 2 and
their parents (Gen 1). However, as Stouffer (1955) specu-
lated, the aggregate results reveal a trend toward greater
acceptance so that the third generation, although more intol-
erant than Gen 2 in 1997 (48% vs. 30%), outperform their
grandparents' generation.
Additional evidence to strengthen these claims can be
found by considering "time-lag cross-generational" compar-
isons (Table 3). Contrasting the generations contained within
the socialization project when they are at comparable ages
illustrates pronounced secular movement over time, along
with generational contrasts, and the changing nature of polit-
ical intolerance. Thus, Gen 2 at age 26 as of 1973, matches
very closely to the older half of Gen 3 as of 1997 (mean age
= 27). Similarly, Gen 2 in 1997 (mean age = 50) matches
almost exactly the mean age of the younger half of Gen 1 in
1973. We see further confirmation of a generational interpre-
tation in Table 3.
These patterns illustrate that being socialized during the
Vietnam War­Civil Rights era was quite a different experi-
ence from being raised before or after that time period. It is
as though the unique political climate and social conditions
within which the 1960s generation came of age conditioned
them to permanently, and increasingly, advocate for uphold-
ing a suspected communist's right to contest for public office
as compared with the previous or later generations at the
same age.
Period Effects
These aggregate findings can also address questions about
longitudinal developments in the commitment of the
American public in general (H5). This third model empha-
sizes the role of changes in context that apply to the whole
population. In this instance, a majority of both generations
indicate a preference for intolerance by expressing a willing-
ness to deny an elected communist to hold public office. By
1982, both generations had changed and become significantly
less intolerant. In this case, the generations began apart and
moved with the times (Figure 1). The younger generation,
however, presumably because of its still impressionable
years, changed more rapidly between 1965 and 1973. In con-
trast, between Waves 2 and 3 (1973 and 1982, respectively),
the gap remains unchanged because the generations moved at
a corresponding rate. These findings provide support for the
influence of period effects (H5) with intolerant opinions
changing in response to external events and conditions.
It is, however, important to bear in mind that the evidence
of change and stability in intolerance attitudes discussed so
far have been primarily based on aggregate-level analyses,
which do not allow us to examine how much "individual-
level" changes are responsible for the patterns revealed.
Therefore, it is important to examine whether the genera-
tional discontinuity highlighted thus far occurs because of
changes in each generation's composition, or because they
were raised in different historical periods.
Given the emphasis on long-term trends, the impact of
social and demographic changes holds a variety of poten-
tially significant implications for intolerance attitudes.
Because opinions are strongly influenced by individual char-
acteristics (e.g., one's occupation or educational attainment,
life histories, day-to-day experiences, peers, etc.), changes to
their social and demographic conditions will produce
changes in their attitudes (Mayer, 1992). Table 4

reports probit estimates of the individual-level determinants
of intolerance attitudes toward a communist officeholder for
Gens 1 and 2. Coefficients in columns 1 to 3 are estimated
using data from 1965, 1973, and 1982, respectively. The tol-
erance item is coded so that a "1" indicates an intolerant
response with a positive coefficient indicating a person is
more likely intolerant, and a negative coefficient means he or
she is less likely to be intolerant.
After controlling for a variety of social and demographic
characteristics identified as important predictors, we find
that one's generation has a strong relationship with the sup-
pression of allowing a suspected communist to hold office.
For these analyses, the generational variable is dichotomized
so that the parent generation was assigned a value of 0,
whereas the second generation was assigned a value of 1. As
the negative sign across columns 1 to 3 indicates, and consis-
tent with previous findings, Gen 2 is consistently less likely
to express intolerance than their parents, a finding that is sta-
tistically significant over the entire panel period (although
the difference between the time periods is not statistically
significant).11
Furthermore, examining Table 4, it becomes clear that
the occurrence of the predictor and the impact is important
for attitude formation. Consistent with previous studies
(e.g., Golebiowska, 1999; Nunn et al., 1978), the positive
and statistically significant coefficients indicate that
Whites, women, and those individuals with less than a col-
lege degree are more intolerant. However, the negative
coefficients for both personal trust and political knowledge
indicate that higher levels of both are associated with a
greater willingness to allow a suspected communist to hold
public office. This confirms previous studies that have
established an association between political sophisticates
and the ability to apply abstract principles in specific situ-
ations (McClosky & Brill, 1983; Wagner, 1986).
Knowledgeable individuals possess an advantage that
likely stems from their increased capacity for thinking
about these matters in a coherent and sophisticated way
(McClosky, 1964), and that facilitates the application of
democratic values to practical situations. It is also worth
noting that the impact of education and political knowledge
on being less intolerant grew significantly over time.
Table 4 also reveals variables that have only a tenuous
relationship with political intolerance. For instance, reli-
gious individuals are politically intolerant to the extent that
they have a certain view of God and the Bible. The positive
and significant coefficient for those who believe the Bible
should be taken literally indicates these individuals are
more willing to suppress rights than people with different
views. This is unsurprising because one of the factors that
made communism so threatening to Americans was its
close association with Godlessness, and as a consequence,
the phrase "under God" was added to the Pledge of
Allegiance (Gibson, 1989). That this relationship is only
statistically significant in the years of 1965 and 1982 likely
reflects the influence of political events and increased
opposition to communists documented during those years
(Mayer, 1992). These findings regarding bible interpreta-
tion are also important for other reasons, most importantly,
that they provide evidence of the theoretical mechanism
underlying the relationship between threat and intolerance
we believe to be in play. If a literal bible interpretation sim-
ply limited one's acceptance of communists, we would
expect that it would influence intolerance regardless of
time period. Instead, an examination of the coefficients for

"Bible's Belief--God's word" reported in Table 4 shows
that the influence of religious beliefs on intolerance waxes
and wanes with the salience of the communist threat. Last,
party identification and social class are not strong determi-
nants of intolerance.
Although the probit model provides statistical support
for the influence of the predictors on intolerance, the coef-
ficients do not lend themselves to intuitive interpretation.
After converting the reported coefficients into probabili-
ties, we can generate predictions about the types of indi-
viduals who would be more (or less) likely to be intolerant.
The most revealing way to do this is to begin by focusing
on a hypothetical individual. By using either the minimum
or maximum values for the binary predictors and entering
the mean values of the continuous variables--political
knowledge and interpersonal trust--we can calculate the
change in probability brought about by changes in those
specific variables. Table 5 shows the results of the calcula-
tions of a hypothetical individual--one who is White, male,
Republican, attends church frequently, believes the Bible is
the literal word of God, has a high school education or less,
and is from the South--and his predicted intolerance of a
communist holding public office.12
The predicted probabilities say a good deal about the
direction and magnitude of these factors on intolerance and
how these relationships reflect age, period, or cohort
effects. A higher score indicates a more intolerant view,
whereas a positive number in the change column (columns
2, 4, and 6 of Table 5) means the predictor is associated
with greater intolerance as compared with the hypothetical
individual. Controlling for the effects of generation (see
bold values in Table 5), we note that the baseline for the
hypothetical individual representing the second generation
is lower than that for the hypothetical parent (0.59, 0.61,
and 0.67 vs. 0.71, 0.68, and 0.75, respectively). For other-
wise identical individuals who differ only in cohort place-
ment--Gen 1 or Gen 2--a substantial degree of difference
exists with regard to allowing a communist to run for public
office as indicated by the "Intergenerational Differences"
shown at the bottom on Table 5 (12% gap in intolerance in
1965, 7% in 1973, and 8% in 1982).
Based on the "over time" readings, these results also sug-
gest that despite the parents' greater inclination for intoler-
ance and the resulting generational gap, the impact generated
by the predictors of intolerance are consistent across the gen-
erations. As a result, the occurrence of a predictor and the
position in the life cycle that it was experienced work to dif-
ferentiate members within the cohort but not across cohorts,
so that members from adjacent cohorts are more alike than
those within the same generation. Thus, in these analyses, the

three or more categories, such as party identification, one value was used as the baseline measure in the model. The political knowledge and interpersonal
trust predictors are indexes created by combining several questions with larger numbers representing greater knowledge or trust, respectively. The

importance of the key predictors has not been modified over
time, but rather, the effect is the same regardless of cohort
placement. The relative stability of these relationships to
intolerance serves to differentiate members within the same
cohort and also maintains the substantial gap between the
two cohorts.
To continue the discussion of political intolerance and
how the effects of the predictors influence the patterns
uncovered, the probit estimates and predicted probabilities
for the second generation and their children (Gens 2 and 3)
are summarized in Tables 6 and 7. The absence of additional
data points limits the discussion somewhat because the aging
process, particularly for Gen 3, is still very much in play.
Moreover, political knowledge and social class have been
excluded from the models as these variables do not exist in
the 1997 survey. As we noted earlier, political knowledge in
particular can be a precondition for political tolerance and its
exclusion may influence the remaining predictors to behave
differently than in earlier analyses. These limitations aside,
the evidence presented suggests that the documented differ-
ences in opinions are due to generational effects. The Gen
2­Gen 3 comparisons shown in Table 6 add further empirical
evidence to this claim, indicating that the legacy of accep-
tance (in Gen 2) does not extend to their offspring, Gen 3.

male, Republican, attends church frequently, believes the Bible is the literal word of God, has a high school education or less, and is from the South) from
a member of the second generation to being a member of the first generation. In 1973 and 1982, the social class measure was added to the model and, for
the purpose of calculating the predicted probability of a hypothetical individual, has been set to represent a member of the middle class.
aThe standard errors for the probabilities have been calculated using the Clarify program designed to simulate quantities of interest for the most
commonly used statistical models, including a binary probit. On this point, see Tomz, Wittenberg, and King (2001).
Clark et al. 11
The coefficient estimate for "Generation--Second" reported
in Table 6 demonstrates that generation is a major contribu-
tor to the explanatory power of our models.
More importantly, from a trend perspective, the influence
of the predictors on political intolerance is consistent with
the earlier comparisons between the first and second genera-
tions, and is reflected in both intragenerational and inter-
generational discontinuities. As before, we find that the
impact of many of the predictors of intolerance is substan-
tively large, and as a consequence, the generational gap is
actually smaller than differences among members of the
same generation. For example, Table 7 shows that educa-
tional attainment in particular works to differentiate mem-
bers within, but not across, cohorts. As a result, members of
adjacent cohorts are more alike (e.g., college graduates of
Gen 2 have a .29 predicted probability of intolerance as
compared with Gen 3's .41 predicted probability, resulting
in a 12% intergenerational gap) than members within the
same cohort (i.e., a 27% intracohort gap between college
graduates and those without a college education, the refer-
ence group). That education remains a relatively stable fac-
tor in terms of its connection to intolerance across the
generations (regardless of the year obtained) suggests that
the impact stems from the amount of education achieved,
irrespective of the educational environment when it was
completed.
Last, additional evidence for the "generational cleavages"
explanation comes from the cross-generation (time-lag) probit
and predicted probabilities (not shown, available on request).
The analysis draws on same-aged individuals at different time
periods, thus ruling out the influence of life-cycle effects. The
figures demonstrate that rather than a convergence in opinions
at similar ages (as is required with the aging explanation), gen-
eration is a major contributor to the explanatory power of the
models (p < .01). Compared with their parents and children at
comparable moments in their life stage, the patterns tell a
familiar story uncovered earlier: Members of the second gen-
eration are less intolerant in youth (8% difference) and middle
age (11%) than their children or parents.
Conclusion
The analyses presented here have taken the tolerance discus-
sion a step forward by focusing on a specific civil liberty and
investigating the importance of three models--life cycle,
generational, and period effects--that could account for
intolerance patterns and trends. Moreover, the study provides
a stringent check of the generalizability of our current under-
standing of the sources of intolerance over an individual's
life span.

At the outset, we outlined several questions we wished to
address. The first question asked how political intolerance
changed over time and across generations, and contingent
on the answer to this first question, what was the source of
the change? In terms of both of these questions discussed
above, the results make several important theoretical points.
First, our results suggest that intolerance is not explained by
a life-cycle effect. Certainly, we find no support for the
proposition that "we all get more conservative as we age" as
the evidence presented actually supports the contrary posi-
tion. The Stoufferian prediction--a decrease in intolerance
through cohort replacement--fits the facts very well. The
longitudinal and contemporaneous gaps in tolerance opin-
ions imply that the persistent age differences in political
intolerance appear attributable to a generational argument.
In some cases, the gap between the first and second genera-
tions is too large to explain away by the effects of aging
alone. The older cohort was more intolerant than the two
younger generations, and the second generation became less
intolerant rather than more, as expected by the life-cycle
hypothesis, with age. The overtime generational compari-
sons show that the difference is relatively constant, which
undermines any sense of gradual and consistent change as
one ages.
Rather, the findings reveal that these age-based patterns
can be explained, for the most part, by the political, eco-
nomic, and social environments in which the generations
were raised. The cohort differences are such that the more
recent generations are less intolerant than the earliest
cohort. The differences in attitudes toward communist
officeholders continue even after controlling for composi-
tional differences in race, gender, education, religiosity,
party identification, social class, region, personal trust, and
knowledge. Put differently, when all else is equal, intoler-
ance declines considerably across birth cohorts. Thus,
change in intolerant attitudes is independent of other
changes in the population, as measured here. Moreover,
because the study examines intolerance, when we observe
that more recent cohorts are less willing to deny the rights
and liberties of others than the oldest generation (Gen 1) in
all survey years, this reflects true generational differences,
and not generational differences in opposition. These are
the major findings of this research.
Second, the evidence suggests the uniqueness of the
second generation. The age-based patterns summarized
earlier indicate that the most important influence on intol-
erant orientations was the unique circumstances in which
the second generation first acquired their viewpoints. The
younger cohort was at the most politically impressionable
ages (under 30 years) during the turbulent decade of
change, the 1960s. Their preferences are definitely less
intolerant than the cohorts who preceded or followed
them. The general pattern, regardless of the
changes taking place in their personal lives and society,
was a fundamental commitment to allowing a suspected
communist to run for public office.
In general terms, period effects are causes of public opin-
ion that affect all cohorts at the same time and produce a
general shift in public opinion in some direction. The data
show a growing acceptance for communist officeholders
over the panel period. Indeed, substantial positive aggregate
movement was captured suggesting the importance of his-
torical happenings regardless of cohort placement. In sum,
the contributions of the three age, period, and cohort dimen-
sions suggest that cohort and period effects largely explain
the longitudinal modifications that occurred while age effects
were relatively unimportant.
Finally, the focus on one specific manifestation of intoler-
ance as a test of the applicability of the Sullivan et al. model
has proven to be beneficial. Not only have the results con-
firmed the relevance of key predictors across birth cohorts
and time periods but also how social and cultural changes
may influence the impact of these predictors to intolerance.
First, the results reveal that the impact of many of the predic-
tors is substantially large and works to differentiate individu-
als "within" a generation. As a consequence, the generation
gap is actually smaller than the intracohort differences among
members of the same generation. Second, among the toler-
ance determinants, political knowledge and education emerge
as strong predictors. This finding squares with the extant lit-
erature because it is widely assumed that higher levels of edu-
cation would expose individuals to differing viewpoints and
discourage intolerance (Gibson, 1992; Stouffer, 1955;
Sullivan et al., 1982).
Similarly, a large body of research shows that increased
education--especially a college experience--tends to
socialize students to have more tolerant and cosmopolitan
views of the world (e.g., Bobo & Licari, 1989; Campbell,
Converse, Miller, & Stokes, 1960; Erikson, Luttbeg, &
Tedin, 1991). The size and direction of the educational
coefficients illustrate the power of this relationship. An
important and related point here is that although education
continues to distinguish members within a cohort, the evi-
dence demonstrates that, despite having obtained their
education under quite dissimilar conditions, the effect of a
college degree works to "minimize" cross-generational
differences. An expectation attached to higher education is
that absolute levels (sum of education achieved) are impor-
tant because educational attainment works in a positive
direction in its influence on political tolerance (Nie et al.,
1996).
The impact of education on tolerance opinions may, how-
ever, depend on relative (age, or historical and political
period attended) levels or both (on this point, see Nie et al.,
1996). That educational achievement remains a reasonably
stable fixture in terms of its connection to intolerance across
Clark et al. 13
the two generations, regardless of the year obtained, suggests
the impact stems from absolute achievement. Moreover, the
education relationship continues regardless of life stage sug-
gesting a more permanent divergence between individuals at
opposite ends of the educational spectrum and regardless of
generational placement.
The existence of tolerant procedural norms is an impor-
tant condition on which a modern democracy rests. These
comparisons offer illustrations and evidence that can be
used to further our understanding about the formation and
continuity of politically intolerant opinions. The longitudi-
nal patterns indicate the source of support for allowing a
suspected communist to run for public office has more to do
with the formative experiences of the younger generations
than social and demographic differences. We realize, of
course, that these conclusions are based on an examination
of a single manifestation of intolerance using a four-wave
national panel study, but it seems to us that these findings
are consistent with what a number of other scholars have
concluded about intolerance of communists. A number of
empirical studies show that Americans remain deeply
divided in their views of communists and yet increasingly
support their civil rights (Gibson, 1992; Mondak & Sanders,
2003; Peffley & Sigelman, 1990). We reach the same con-
clusion but with the certainty that is only possible with panel
data.

(TRUST) Generally speaking, would you say that most peo-
ple can be trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing
with people?
(HELPFUL) Would you say that most of the time people try to
be helpful or that they are mostly looking out for themselves?
(FAIR) Do you think that most people would try to take advan-
tage of you if they got a chance or would they try to be fair?
Political Knowledge Index--Six Components
An index based on the number of correct answers to six fac-
tual questions. Don't know and incorrect answers were
treated as incorrect responses. Cases with any missing data
(NA) were dropped.

Notes
1. Stouffer's study, consisting of 4,933 respondents, asked
nine questions about restricting the activities of an admitted
Communist. Only 113 or 2.3% of his sample would allow
Communists to engage in various types of political activities
and expressions including making a speech in the community,
having a book in the library, working at the defense plant or
teaching in a university.
 2. This research utilizes national samples of three lineage genera-
tions stretching from 1965 to 1997 (see Appendix A for wave
panel summary).
3. Public Trust in Government: 1958-2010 (http://people-press.
org/trust/)
 4. See Appendix B for a complete list and wording of the social,
psychological, and political variables utilized in this research.
5. A more detailed discussion of the research design including
survey methodology, response rates, and generalizability can
be found in Chapter 4 of A Telescope on Society--Survey
Research & Social Science at the University of Michigan &
Beyond (Jennings, 2004).
 6. All analysis is conducted using pooled data sets, but analysis
conducted for the generations separately show similar results.
7. Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus (1982) created the least-
liked tolerance measure wherein they effectively argued
that to determine whether someone is extending tolerance
to a group, such as communists, you first need to determine
whether they like that group. That is, extending civil liberties
and rights to groups and/or individuals with which you agree
or are indifferent toward does not measure tolerance. Rather,
if you vehemently dislike or disagree with a group and/or
individual, but are willing to extend civil rights and liberties
regardless, then you are truly practicing political tolerance.
In making this argument, Sullivan et al. effectively chal-
lenged the standard means of measuring tolerance at the time
(e.g., the method used by Stouffer, 1955, and Nunn, Crockett,
& Williams, 1978).
8. The lack of recognition of these undeniable rights as dem-
onstrated by a "don't know" or "refuse to state" also consti-
tutes an intolerant response. As discussed previously, there is
support in the tolerance literature (most notably, Mondak &
Sanders, 2003) for the position that a refusal to extend civil
liberties to any group--regardless of affect or indifference--
represents an intolerant attitude.
9. The probit technique produces maximum likelihood estima-
tions (MLEs), which are estimates of change on the cumula-
tive standard normal distribution that results from a one-unit
change in the independent variable with the remaining vari-
ables held constant (Aldrich & Nelson, 1984).
10. Continuity here refers to the level of response agreement
between consecutive panel waves. Because the tolerance
variable is dichotomous, the resulting correlation is a phi-
coefficient. The phi-coefficient is a measure of the degree
of association between two binary variables (for a more
thorough discussion of the phi-coefficient and its usage,
please see An Introduction to Statistics by Professor Keith G.
Calkins: http://www.andrews.edu/~calkins/math/edrm611/
edrm13.htm)
11. The test for significance between the 1965-1973 and 1973-1982
equations is calculated using the two-stage least squares (2SLS)
procedure. Because the error terms in panel data are likely to be
correlated over time, the first stage is used to estimate an "instru-
ment" for the lagged intolerance variable from the prior panel
period. The second stage uses the predicted value in the previous
panel to determine whether the difference in coefficients in the
later panel represents a significant change over time.
12. The interpersonal trust and knowledge indexes are set at the
mean unless otherwise specified. In 1973 and 1982, the social
class measures was added to the model, and for the purpose
of calculating the predicted probability of a hypothetical indi-
vidual, has been set to represent a member of the middle class.

Note. Responses were coded as either "consistent" or "discrepant" for allowing a communist officeholder for each wave of data as compared with the
next. Consistent reports for each time period (e.g., 1965-1973) included individuals who gave either a tolerant or intolerant response at both waves
of data collection. Respondents categorized as discrepant included those who reported a different response in the prior wave as compared with the
subsequent wave of data collection.
