Objectives. This research assessed how parents' transfers of sentiment, time, and financial assets to their adolescent/
young adult children affect the children's propensity in middle age to provide social support to their aging parents. We
tested whether the mechanism of long-term intergenerational exchange is better modeled as a return on investment, an
insurance policy triggered by the longevity or physical frailty of parents, or the result of altruistic (or other nonrecipro-
cal) motivations on the part of adult children.
Methods. Models were examined with 6 waves of data from the University of Southern California Longitudinal
Study of Generations. The sample consisted of 501 children who participated in the 1971 survey and who had at least 1
parent surviving in 1985. Growth curve modeling was applied to predict average levels and rates of change in social sup-
port provided to mothers and fathers between 1985 and 1997 as a function of early parental transfers of affection, asso-
ciation, and tangible resources to their children.
Results. Children who spent more time in shared activities with their mothers and fathers in 1971 provided more
support to them on average. Receiving greater financial support from parents in 1971 raised the marginal rate at which
support provided by children increased over time. Maternal health operated synergistically with early affection to pro-
duce greater levels of support. Both levels and rates of increase in support from children were positive, even for children
who received no early transfers from their parents.
Discussion. The results offer some support for investment, insurance, and altruistic models of intergenerational ex-
change. Sharing time in activities provides a direct return to the parent that is characteristic of an investment strategy,
whereas financial transfers provide a time-contingent return that is characteristic of an insurance mechanism. That affec-
tion triggers greater support to more functionally impaired mothers suggests that emotionally investing in children as a
health insurance mechanism may be based on the greater moral equity accorded to mothers. The motivation of adult
children to provide social support to their older parents is partially rooted in earlier family experiences and guided by an
implicit social contract that ensures long-term reciprocity.
ECIPROCITY in adult parent­child relations has been
the object of much investigation as a principle guiding
transfers of time, labor, and financial assets across genera-
tions. Studies in this area have examined balance or asym-
metry in exchanges between generations at one point in time
(Antonucci, 1990), across a set of repeated cross-sectional
assessments (Morgan, Schuster, & Butler, 1991), and in the
same individuals over time with retrospective reports (Hen-
retta, Hill, Li, Soldo, & Wolf, 1997; Whitbeck, Simons, &
Conger, 1991). However, a life-course approach stressing
the dynamic aspects of reciprocity calls for long-term data
on intergenerational transfers from the same individuals over
time. In this investigation we employed longitudinal data
over 26 years in the lives of two generations to identify how
parents' investment of sentiment, time, and financial re-
sources in their adolescent/young adult children affects the
children's propensity in middle age to provide support to
their aging parents more than a quarter century later.
This research addressed the basic question of why adult
children provide support to their elderly parents. In the ab-
sence of bioevolutionary imperatives for such support (re-
productive goals are not at issue as they are for parental sup-
port to children), one is directed toward explanations that
derive from social theories, particularly as they relate to
mechanisms of equity and reciprocity in interpersonal ex-
changes. We addressed this issue by turning attention to the
historical antecedents of these later life relationships and
proposed three models to explain the nature of the linkage
between early involvement of parents and reciprocation by
their children in the form of old-age support. In these mod-
els support from children was conceptualized as (a) a return
on an investment made earlier by the parent, (b) an insur-
ance policy in which earlier transfers to the child are recov-
ered by the parent under conditions of need, and (c) altruism
and other nonreciprocal motivations on the part of the child.
Both investment and insurance models reflected motiva-
tions based on dynamics of lagged reciprocity. We defined
lagged reciprocity as the circumstance when the provision
of support to older parents was the fulfillment of an obliga-
tion to repay a social debt based on that parent's earlier
transfers to the child. An investment model held when ear-
lier transfers to the child were unconditionally returned, and
an insurance model was valid when earlier transfers to the
child were returned only in the event of parental need. Al-
truism and other nonreciprocal motivations were operating
in families when adult children provided support to parents
who made few intergenerational transfers to their children
when they were younger.

Our theoretical conceptualization integrated several disci-
plinary traditions in the study of intergenerational transfers
within the family. We employed complementary perspec-
tives from sociology, social psychology, and economics to
produce an empirical specification that was informed by the
assumptions of each. We next review in greater detail the
underpinnings of exchange theory as it pertains to the dy-
namics of long-term serial transfers in intergenerational
family relationships.
Exchange Theory
Although economic exchange theory and social exchange
theory have some differences, both share the premise that
social relationships are governed by a norm of reciprocity­
the expectation that a debt should be repaid (Emerson,
1981; Gouldner, 1960; Molm & Cook, 1995). In economic
terminology, norms shape preferences in such a way as to
make parental repayment preferable to nonrepayment (i.e.,
avoiding shame, threats to reputation, or guilt). In terms of
social exchange theory, adherence to norms grants the indi-
vidual a social status within the group that confers rights,
benefits, and prestige (Homans, 1974). In both contexts,
norms enforce and reinforce acts of reciprocity and serve as
the implicit reason why preferences for repayment exist at
all. Here we review these two scholarly traditions with re-
gard to their explanation of child-provided support to older
parents.
Microeconomic exchange theory.--Exchange models
that derive from rational choice theory in classical micro-
economics generally assume that individuals tend to engage
in actions that maximize personal rewards and minimize
personal costs (Becker, 1974). Some applications of eco-
nomic exchange theory to families have focused on be-
quests (a promised inheritance delayed until the parent's
death) as an asset that motivates children to provide social
support to their elderly parents (Cox, 1987; Henretta et al.,
1997). Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers (1985) extended
this theory to the "strategic bequest" motive, where parents
withhold intergenerational transfers until death as a means
of maintaining a "bargaining chip" that can be played to ob-
tain favors, assistance, and parent­child interaction. This
strategy may be especially salient later in life when elderly
parents have little choice but to call on their children for
such attention. Because the focus of our investigation was
on serial patterns of inter vivos transfers, bequests were not
specifically addressed. Further, it has been shown elsewhere
(Cox & Raines, 1985) that inter vivos transfers make up the
bulk of private transfers in the United States. Still, the be-
quest motivation serves as a powerful metaphor for under-
standing how intergenerational transfers are guided by prin-
ciples of exchange and reciprocity.
Several other theories in the rational choice tradition of
microeconomics have stressed self-interested motivations in
intergenerational transfers: the rotten child and the demon-
stration effect hypotheses. Becker (1974) described how su-
perficially altruistic behavior can be manifested even by a
rotten or selfish child. In our application, this may occur if
the putatively selfish or rotten child has transferred re-
sources to an altruistic parent (one for whom the utility
function of that child is an argument in his or her utility
function). Under these conditions, the rotten child expects
that the parent will redistribute resources to compensate for
his or her sacrifice. The demonstration effect proposes that
adult children have an incentive to support their aging par-
ents to demonstrate to their own children the importance of
providing such support, from which they hope to eventually
benefit (Cox & Stark, 1992). In this formulation, adult chil-
dren are behaving in a manner that will indirectly provide
rewards as a form of generalized exchange.
Although self-interested motivations are useful for under-
standing the mutuality of more immediate intergenerational
exchanges, they tend to minimize the importance of giving
and receiving over the history of these long-term relation-
ships. In this investigation we focused on serial patterns of
inter vivos transfers over the life course of the parent­child
relationship. Our models tested the assumption that the in-
tergenerational contract, enforced by the norm of reciproc-
ity, compels adult children to repay long-term social debts
to their parents. Thus, any immediate "leverage" wielded by
parents to control the actions of children (as is suggested in
the case of bequests) gives way to obligations based on a
"fairness" norm--the notion that social and economic debts
should be repaid. In another sense, the benefits of meeting
the expectation to reciprocate are intrinsic to the importance
placed on continuing the relationship amicably.
Social exchange theory.--Where microeconomics tends
to focus only on the exchange transactions themselves, so-
cial exchange theory incorporates the relationship between
the exchange partners, their history of transactions, and
their mutual interdependence into its framework. Molm and
Cook (1995, p. 210) put it this way: "Whereas classical mi-
croeconomic theory typically assumed the absence of long-
term relations between exchange partners and the indepen-
dence of sequential exchange transactions, social exchange
theory took as its subject matter . . . the more or less endur-
ing relations that form between specific partners." Sociolo-
gists analyze the relationship itself and the social structures
that govern the value attached to particular behaviors, the
tolerance of dependence, and the expectation for reciproca-
tion (including type and timing) in that particular relation-
ship. Giving to others and building an obligation for later re-
payment is considered the social glue out of which emerges
small group stability--including family solidarity (Homans,
1950). Mutual dependence builds cohesion in relationships
with high levels of primacy and to which there are few alter-
natives, such as those that tend to be found in families (Em-
erson, 1962).
In addition, sociologists extend classical economic ex-
change theory by proposing that resources other than finan-
cial assets can be used as a currencies of exchange (Emer-
son, 1981; Homans, 1974). Social exchange theorists have
argued that the norm of reciprocity is a principle of obliga-
tion to repay, in some fashion, the receipt of valued assets,
services, or sentiments (Gouldner, 1960). Thus, approval,
affirmation, and emotional support--if they are valued re-
sources when provided by that particular partner--tend to
attract reciprocation. This reciprocation need not be imme-
diate or made in units equivalent to the initial investment for
RECIPROCITY IN PARENT­CHILD RELATIONS S5
the exchange to be considered balanced over the long term
(Hollstein & Bria, 1998). For instance, parental investments
of time or emotion in their dependent children may later be
reciprocated with instrumental forms of assistance from
them as adults.
A general model of exchange.--Thus, economists and
sociologists incorporate self-interested motivations and the
norm of reciprocity in social exchanges between genera-
tions. Both would argue that adult children feel that (a) they
should repay parents for transfers made to them earlier in
life and (b) their repayment to parents should be propor-
tional to what they received. However, an important refine-
ment to both of these approaches would specify the condi-
tions under which adult children are motivated to repay
earlier parental transfers to them. We proposed that it is nec-
essary to consider whether the growing needs of aging par-
ents serve as a catalyst to repayment. By taking need into
account, we were able to test if the norm of reciprocity re-
sults in the production of an investment strategy or an insur-
ance policy for the parent.
If children's return of support to parents is proportional to
the parents' initial contribution to them, but not contingent
on the parents' current needs, then an investment model
would be a better representation of the process. In this
model the return on the initial investment is fixed and, thus,
redeemed by the parent under most conditions as an earned
reward. Becker and Tomes (1976) used such a model when
they theorized that parents' early investments in children's
education (human capital) are designed to maximize a re-
turn on their investment. Empirical results on this issue are
mixed. Research by Behrman, Pollak, and Taubman (1982)
demonstrated that parents' primary investment concern is
with promoting equality among their children and not reci-
procity. However, another study of parental financial sup-
port to adult children found that those siblings who received
sizable financial transfers from older parents were the ones
most likely to provide social support to those parents, sug-
gesting a quid pro quo in observed transfers over time (Hen-
retta et al., 1997).
An insurance model of parent-child exchange would hold
if children's return of parental contributions was both pro-
portional to the initial investment and took place when the
parents were in greatest need. In this model parents make
contributions of affect, time, and financial assets to children
with the expectation that those children will reciprocate by
responding to negative contingencies that emerge later in
life, including health declines, widowhood, and financial
hardship following retirement.
Economists, in particular, have considered investment in
children as a means to reduce the risk of having unmet fi-
nancial needs in old age. Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) theo-
rized that family formation serves as an alternative annuities
market that insures against deficits that might occur as a re-
sult of an unexpectedly long life. Investment in children has
also been considered as a rational alternative to the purchase
of long-term care insurance (Pauly, 1990). Thus, the impact
of depleting one's savings and developing chronic illness in
old age is mitigated by the willingness of children to recip-
rocate for earlier investments made in them by their parents.
Services such as companionship that do not have clear mar-
ket alternatives may be even more likely to be included in
an informal insurance contract.
The notion of a support bank, developed by Antonucci
(1990) to interpret serial patterns of intergenerational ex-
change over the life course is consistent with insurance and
investment models of reciprocity. In this paradigm she uses
the metaphor of a bank to describe the lagged dynamics of
reciprocity in intergenerational relationships. A support
bank symbolically serves as a repository of equity that par-
ents build early in the family life cycle by investing in their
children's well-being. This social capital is withdrawn later
in life in the form of social support from children at any
time, but especially when the parents develop age-associ-
ated dependencies. Importantly, this model highlights that,
although at any one point in time exchanges between par-
ents and children may appear to be unbalanced, reciprocity
is observed when the balance of exchanges over the life of
the relationship is tallied. Thus, partners in the intergenera-
tional relationship variously play the role of provider and of
receiver, depending on the type and timing of their develop-
mental needs. The life-course perspective provides an addi-
tional lens through which to view the interdependence of
family members. This paradigm considers human develop-
ment as a relational process of linked lives through time and
stresses the importance of long-term relationships in shap-
ing the resources and well-being of individuals as they age
(Bengtson, Biblarz, & Roberts, in press; Elder, 1994).
Altruism and other theories.--Several theories offer al-
ternative explanations for why adult children who received
little or no transfers from parents nevertheless provide sup-
port to them in the absence of a discernable social debt.
Among these is the theory that altruistic motivations guide
family members to provide support to each other. In this
paradigm, intergenerational exchanges are driven uncondi-
tionally by the needs of potential support recipients--rather
than by the principle of reciprocity (Stark, 1995; Stark &
Falk, 1998).
Results of empirical research are mixed as to whether pa-
rental transfers to adult children are altruistically motivated.
Some research has found little support for altruism (Altonji,
Hayashi, & Kotlikoff, 1992, 1997); other research has found
that the principle of need tends to drive inter vivos eco-
nomic or time/labor transfers between generations (Dunn &
Phillips, 1997; Laitner & Juster, 1996; McGarry, 1999; Mc-
Garry & Schoeni, 1995). Looking at point-in-time, inter vi-
vos transfers, Cox (1987) found that parental transfers to
children are in effect payments for services rendered, sup-
porting an exchange hypothesis over altruism. However,
aside from studies of the bequest motivation, little research
has focused on whether support provided by adult children
to their aged parents is altruistically motivated or driven by
antecedent intergenerational transfers.
As we have mentioned earlier, the rotten child hypothesis
and the demonstration effect serve as alternative explana-
tions to altruism for why adult children who in childhood
received little nurturing from their parents may still provide
support to them in later life. We labeled these explanations,
along with altruism, as nonreciprocal motivations because
S6 SILVERSTEIN ET AL.
they do not require an exchange deficit that favors the par-
ent as a precondition for supportive behavior by the child.
Conceptual Model
In this study, we examined whether emotional, time, and
financial investments made by parents in their late-teen and
young-adult children are reciprocated by the children in the
form of social support provided to their older parents up to
26 years later. These three investments corresponded to di-
mensions of intergenerational solidarity, a paradigm devel-
oped by Bengtson and colleagues for distinguishing the ties
that bind the generations in the family (Bengtson & Roberts,
1991; Mangen, Bengtson, & Landry, 1988; Roberts &
Bengtson, 1990). Emotional investment in the child corre-
sponded to affectual solidarity, the amount of time spent in
shared activities with the child corresponded to associa-
tional solidarity, and financial transfers made to the child
corresponded to functional solidarity.
Our aim was to study whether these three types of inter-
generational transfers made early in the family life cycle
were later reciprocated in the form of (a) higher levels of so-
cial support to parents and/or (b) greater rates of increase in
social support to parents over the course of later life. We
also examined whether (a) and (b) were contingent on pa-
rental frailty as a triggering mechanism of support. If trans-
fers operate under the principle of investment, then children
who received more valued resources from their parents
should reciprocate more by providing higher average levels
of social support than children who received fewer such re-
sources from their parents. If early transfers from parents
operate under the principle of insurance, then reciprocation
by children would be contingent on the aging and/or the
functional health of the parent (i.e., parental longevity and
increasing disability would drive higher rates of return per
unit of the early transfer). In our formulation, an insurance
mechanism is not necessarily mutually exclusive with an in-
vestment mechanism. Parental contributions may yield both
direct and contingent dividends, much as an annuity gener-
ates interest income before it pays a lump sum benefit in the
event of death. A subsidiary proposition specified that altru-
ism and other nonreciprocal motivations would be operating
if, among adult children who received no early transfers, (a)
the average level of social support provided was signifi-
cantly above zero and/or (b) the rate of social support pro-
vided increased significantly over time.
METHODS
Sample
We addressed our research questions using data from the
University of Southern California Longitudinal Study of
Generations, a study of 2,044 individuals, aged 16­91, from
328 three-generation families. Eligible sample members
were generated from the families of grandparents randomly
selected in 1971 from the membership of a large (840,000-
member) prepaid health maintenance organization in the
Los Angeles area. The sample pool was generally represen-
tative of White, economically stable middle- and working-
class families. Self-administered questionnaires were mailed
to the grandparents and their spouses (G1), their adult chil-
dren (G2), and their adolescent grandchildren (G3). Surviv-
ing respondents were surveyed again in 1985, 1988, 1991,
1994, and 1997. The unique longitudinal and intergenera-
tional design of this survey provided us an opportunity to
prospectively examine the long-term effects of early family
relationships by assessing these relationships at the time
they were experienced. Thus, we were able to avoid some of
the problems associated with retrospective reports, namely
that the conditions of current relationships may color mem-
ories of earlier family life.
The subsample for this analysis comprised G3 respon-
dents who (a) participated in 1971 and in at least one other
survey and (b) had at least one parent surviving to 1985. Al-
most 70% of the children in this generation fit the criteria
for inclusion, resulting in 501 respondents. From this group
we derived an analytic sample consisting of 416 child-
mother relationships and 317 child-father relationships with
variation in the dependent variable over time. The number
of measurements obtained from children between 1985 and
1997 were as follows (presented in terms of relationships
with mothers/fathers): 14%/18% with two measurements,
13%/15% with three measurements, 20%/17% with four
measurements, and 54%/50% with five measurements.
Children ranged in age from 16 to 26 years in 1971, with
an average age of 19 years, and 59% were daughters. About
60% lived with at least one parent in 1971. Some of the
same children appeared in both analytic samples because of
the joint survival of their parents. The mean age of the par-
ents in 1971 was 43 years for mothers and 46 years for fa-
thers. By 1997, surviving mothers and fathers averaged 69
and 72 years old, respectively.
Dependent Variable
Social support to each parent served as the time-varying
dependent variable in this analysis. Social support was oper-
ationalized as assistance provided by adult children to each
of their parents in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, and 1997. At
each wave of measurement, support provided to parents in
the following five areas were assessed: shopping/transporta-
tion, financial support, emotional support, discussing im-
portant life decisions, and information/advice. We dichoto-
mously scored (0  "not provided"; 1  "provided") each
indicator and summed them to create an additive scale rang-
ing from 0 to 5 at each time period. Reliability of these scale
items ranged from .62 to .70 across the five waves of mea-
surement. The means of this scale across each year of mea-
surement revealed a steady rise in the amount of support pro-
vided to each parent over the 12-year period (Table 1).
Independent Variables
Early transfers from mothers and fathers were reported
separately by the adolescent and young adult children in
1971 (see Table 2). Three types of transfers--time/activi-
ties, emotional, and financial--were measured with a proto-
col developed by Bengtson and colleagues that corre-
sponded to associational, affectual, and functional solidarity
between generations (see Mangen et al., 1988, for psycho-
metric properties of each scale). Amount of time spent in
shared activities was measured as the sum of five items rep-
resenting the degree of associational solidarity with mothers
RECIPROCITY IN PARENT­CHILD RELATIONS S7
and fathers. These items included the frequency of having
conversations, attending family gatherings, talking about
important matters, having dinner together, and exchanging
small gifts with each parent. Each item was rated on a scale
of 0­7, where 0  "almost never" and 7  "almost every
day." Reliability of items was .90 and .88 for association
with mothers and fathers, respectively. The total scale score
had a range of 0­35, with the sample averaging 16.9 (SD 
6.4) in relations with mothers and 15.3 (SD  6.1) in rela-
tions with fathers.
Emotional intimacy was measured as the sum of 10 items
representing affectual solidarity with mothers and fathers.
These items reflected the perceived level of trust, fairness,
respect, understanding, and affection in the relationship
with each parent. Each item was rated on a scale of 0­5,
where 0  "not at all" and 5  "extremely." Reliability co-
efficients were .93 and .91 for affection with mothers and
fathers, respectively. The total scale score had a potential
range of 0­50. The sample mean of the scale was 37.2 (SD 
8.4) in relations with mothers and 35.9 (SD  9.1) in rela-
tions with fathers.
Financial assistance, a form of functional solidarity, was
measured by a single item concerning the amount of mone-
tary support provided by each parent ("none," "a little,"
"some," and "quite a bit"). This variable was scored on a
scale of 0­3 with a mean of 1.6 (SD  1.2) in relations with
mothers and 1.9 (SD  1.2) in relations with fathers.
Correlations among the three types of transfers were
moderate to low, ranging from a high of .29 (between asso-
ciation and affection in relations with mothers) to a low of
.01 (between affection and financial in relations with fa-
thers). This suggested that these three transfers represent
unique ways that parents invest in their children and, thus,
could be treated independently.
Our interest in physical vulnerability of parents as a trig-
gering mechanism caused us to include a scale of functional
impairment as a predictor of support flows. Functional diffi-
culty was measured as the ability of the parent to walk up
and down stairs, walk more than a block, prepare meals, do
household chores, and take care of personal hygiene, with
each item rated by the parent on a scale of 1­4, where 1 
"no difficulty" and 4  "unable to do." Because the design
of the survey instrument included functional health mea-
sures only in the last two waves of the survey it was not pos-
sible for us to effectively include functional health as a
time-varying covariate. Thus, we took the latest available
data reported by each parent to create an additive scale
score to denote functional impairment, ranging from 5 ("no
difficulties") to 20 ("unable to perform any task"). Reliabil-
ity coefficients of these measures were .85 in 1994 and .77
in 1997. For 35 mothers and 81 fathers who dropped out of
the study before 1994, we imputed functional impairment
(using multiple regression) from the most recently available
data in 1985, 1988, or 1991 using somatic symptoms (e.g.,
"I cannot get going") and self-rated health as instrumental
variables. After inserting imputed values, the mean func-
tional impairment score was 6.0 (SD  2.1) for mothers and
6.7 for fathers (SD  1.3). Functional impairment scores of
parents were matched to their children's survey responses
and included as a fixed effect in Level 2 equations.
We also controlled for covariates that have been found to
be associated with intergenerational transfers. These in-
cluded parent's and child's age, gender of child, the highest
education achieved by the child, and whether the child re-
sided with the target parent in 1971. Functional impairment
and all control variables were centered at their respective
means.
Statistical Procedure
We used six waves of data to examine whether early trans-
fers from parents to children were reciprocated in the form
of old-age support. Because of our interest in initial levels
and rates of increase in support provided, we used hierarchi-
cal linear modeling (HLM) to (a) investigate growth curves
in the amount of social support provided to parents between
1985 and 1997 and (b) examine sources of heterogeneity in
those initial levels and rates of increase as they relate to the
amount of early transfers to the child (Bryck & Rauden-
bush, 1992). HLM is particularly useful in examining
trajectories in multiwave data, particularly when some re-
spondents have incomplete data over time. Further, this
technique allowed us to use the passage of time as a proxy
for the accumulation of age-related deficits in the older gen-
eration.
The application of HLM required specifications at two
levels of analysis. At the first level, we used a maximum
likelihood approach to regress time-varying social support

specified for each respondent as
where yij
is the social support index and tij
is the time value
for the jth child at the ith year of measurement. The estimate
aj
is the random intercept evaluated at the mean of time, bj
is
the random slope, and uij
is the disturbance term. Estimates
of randomly varying coefficients were stabilized through an
empirical Bayes/maximum likelihood estimation procedure
that "shrinks" unreliable Level 1 estimates (those with large
standard errors and/or based on a small number of data
points) toward an overall solution (see Bryck & Rauden-
bush, 1992). The time variable was operationalized as sur-
vey year centered by its grand mean. Although grand mean
centering produces an equivalent linear model to that using
raw scores, parameter estimates may differ from models
without centering or that use other types of centering (see
Kreft & De Leeuw, 1998). In our application of centering,
the random intercepts were evaluated 5.7 years after 1985,
or approximately 1991. Our centering strategy was based on
the premise that the best single estimate of the level of sup-
port provided by each individual would be obtained at the
midpoint of the 12-year interval.
At the second level of analysis, we estimated the aggre-
gate level and rate of change with the following fixed ef-
fects equations:
where g00
represents the estimated value of social support in
approximately 1991 (the mean time value), g10
represents
the estimated slope between 1985 and 1997, and w0j
and w1j
are error terms signifying person-specific deviations from
the fixed effect estimates of g00
and g10
, respectively. The
two gamma coefficients provided the necessary information
for us to summarize the height and shape of the growth
curve for the sample.
If the variances of w0j
and w1j
were significant, then aj
and bj
could be said to vary randomly across the j individu-
als in the sample, and it then becomes possible for us to test
for sources of between-subject variation in these random
coefficients. If x is a variable describing the baseline paren-
tal transfer to children (in 1971), then the following equa-
tions estimate the effect of that transfer on the height and
shape of the growth curve of social support provided to par-
ents over time:
In these bivariate models g01
and g11
are estimates of the
linear relationship between xj
and the two random effects aj
and bj
. Control variables are added to these second-level
equations as appropriate. When control variables are cen-
tered at their respective means, the fixed intercepts g00
and
g10
are interpreted as the predicted level and slope for social

support provided by the "average" adult child when parental
transfer x is set at zero. If significant, these intercepts would
confirm an altruism/nonreciprocal model of support be-
cause they would demonstrate support flows to parents who
made no initial investment in their child. Because estima-
tion of standard errors of the gamma coefficients takes into
account error variance at the unit or participant level, these
coefficients are considered to have high degrees of power
and precision (see Kreft & De Leeuw, 1998). In addition,
because standard error estimates are based on the error vari-
ance pooled across all participants who provide data, they
are not affected by the fact that participants with only two
measurements have no error variance (see Bryck & Rauden-
bush, 1992).
We took sample selection bias due to attrition of adult
children into account by weighting the sample in all HLM
equations by the inverse of their predicted probability of
post-1971 retention (details on the computation of this in-
strumental variable--a variant of the Heckman (1979) pro-
cedure--are available from the authors).
RESULTS
We first reviewed the overall patterns of social support
provided to parents over time. Table 3 shows the "intercept
only" equations (i.e., no predictor variables) that revealed
the summary growth curves in support provided to mothers
and fathers over time. The level and rate of increase were
statistically significant for both sets of relationships. Pre-
dicted values from these equations revealed a clear rise in
support provided to both mothers and fathers over time
(Figure 1). Because a quadratic term for the time variable
was not significant in the equation, this linear specification
was the best representation of the time trend. As expected,
support to mothers occurred at a higher level than support

provided to fathers, and this gap remained fairly consistent
over the 12 years of follow-up.
The error variance for each of the random effects shown
in Table 3 revealed significant between-subject heterogene-
ity, leading us to examine sources of this variation in the
height and in the acceleration of the growth curves. Table 4
shows parameter estimates of the effects of early (1971)
transfers from parents on the level (in 1991) and rate of
change (between 1985 and 1997) in social support provided
to each parent. The three transfer variables were tested first
individually and then added together in the same model. In
all equations, control variables were applied. Model 1 shows
that the association with mothers and fathers in 1971 pre-
dicted higher average levels of support provided, with greater
amount of time spent in shared activities increasing the sup-
port provided by children in approximately 1991. However,
there was no impact of early association on rates of increase
in support provided over the 12-year time interval.
In Model 2 we present the influence of emotional inti-
macy with parent on the provision of social support. Receiv-
ing more affection from mothers and fathers in 1971 was as-
sociated with providing greater social support to them in
about 1991. Similar to the earlier model, rates of increase in
social support were not sensitive to the size of the initial in-
vestment of emotion in children by mothers or by fathers.
Model 3 shows that the amount of baseline financial
transfers made by fathers was positively associated with the
average support provided by children to their fathers in
1991. Financial support from mothers positively influenced
the rate of change in support provided, such that greater fi-
nancial contributions were related to sharper increases in the
amount of support provided to mothers over the 12-year
period (p  .07). No such relationship was observed for
fathers.
Finally, in Model 4, we included the three initial transfer
variables in the same equation simultaneously. In the equa-
tion predicting average support in 1991, only association
with parents was a significant predictor of the amount of
support to both mothers and fathers. The direct nature of the
exchange suggested an investment mechanism of reciproc-
ity with regard to earlier time transfers by parents. The aver-
age return of social support on emotional investments in
children--significant in Model 1--appeared to be explained
by the higher frequency of interaction and shared activities
found in emotionally closer relationships.
Predicting the rate of increase in support in our saturated
model, we found that greater financial support provided to
children at baseline almost significantly raised the marginal
rates at which support provided to mothers (p  .07) and fa-
thers (p  .08) increased over time. Because the effects of
financial transfers were time dependent, these findings were
consistent with an insurance model of exchange. Indeed, the
results strengthened with affection and association factors
controlled (especially for fathers), suggesting that the effect
of financial assistance was suppressed in Model 3 by the re-
lationship strain experienced by some children who were
economically dependent on their parents. Further, the con-
stants (fixed intercepts) in each equation, representing the
effects among those children who received no support from
their parents, were all statistically significant, suggesting
that altruistic or other nonreciprocal motivations may have
been driving their positive levels and increasing rates of
support.
Our final set of tests involved identifying the extent to
which physical impairment of each parent triggered a return
to the equity built from earlier transfers. In Table 5 we show
the interaction terms between the functional limitation of
each parent and the three transfers from parents in 1971.
The only significant interaction term was between func-
tional limitation and affection with mother in predicting the
average amount of support provided to them in approxi-
mately 1991. This positive coefficient indicated that func-

tional difficulties experienced by mothers magnified the av-
erage amount of support reciprocated by children in
response to earlier affectual ties. The interaction is shown in
Figure 2 as a bar chart with functional health and affection
scores held at 1 and 1 standard deviations from their re-
spective means. This chart shows that middle-aged children
provided, on average, more support to mothers who had
greater functional difficulties and with whom they were
emotionally closer in 1971. By contrast, children with
healthier mothers and/or a history of greater emotional re-
moteness responded with lower amounts of support. Frailty
of mothers apparently triggered a greater supportive re-
sponse from children when there was emotional reserve in
the relationship. These findings were robust both to the cen-
tering method used and, given the relatively small sample
size, to the inclusion of covariates. That is, consistent find-
ings were obtained when time was centered at the baseline
period as well as when covariates were excluded from the
models.
DISCUSSION
In this investigation we examined several processes un-
derlying long-term reciprocity in adult intergenerational re-
lationships. We used data on intergenerational exchanges
over a 27-year period to trace the effects of early transfers
of affection, time, and money from parents to children on
the propensity of those same children to provide social sup-
port to their elderly parents. We tested three mechanisms--
investment, insurance, and altruism--by examining whether
and under what conditions early transfers resulted in higher
levels of support to parents over time.
Our results reveal partial support for each of the three
models of intergenerational exchange. Both mothers and fa-
thers who shared more activities with their children--a
proxy for the transfer of the valued resource of time--
receive higher levels of support from them, suggesting an
investment model of intergenerational transfers. That the
return gained by parents is proportional to their initial in-
vestment suggests that families function as a forum for di-
rect--although not necessarily simultaneous or equiva-
lent--reciprocity between generations.
By contrast, the reciprocation of early financial transfers
to children emerges only over time (financial support did
not differentiate level of initial support), suggesting a la-
tency in the response of adult children that is more charac-
teristic of an insurance mechanism. The question remains
why financial support to children is the only transfer of the
three tested to produce a time-dependent response from
children. One answer may have to do with the nature of the
transfer itself. Financial transfers are not likely to produce
the direct "purchase" of support because norms of family
life mitigate the use of purely instrumental strategies in kin-
ship groups (Litwak, 1985; Parsons, 1944; Parsons & Bales,
1955). Alternatively, parents who are best equipped to fi-
nancially assist their children earlier in life may have suffi-
cient resources to remain independent until late in life.
Our most consistent finding is that even under what may
be considered to be estranged circumstances--when the
early parent­child relationship was emotionally distant, had
no time commitment, and involved no financial support--
the amount of support provided to parents increases as they
age. This suggests a form of altruism whereby children re-

spond over time to the age-related needs of their parents in
spite of the poor quality of their earlier relationships. Sup-
portive behavior of this type may likely be linked to a sense
of filial duty on the part of such children (see Richlin-Klon-
sky & Bengtson, 1996). Research that delves more deeply
into the underlying nature of altruistic motivations may well
discover another currency of intergenerational value related
to the investment of moral capital in children--transferred
through early socialization to norms of familism. The use of
time to proxy the multiple changes occurring in the older
parents may also relate to changes occurring among the
children. The expanded duration of the relationship may
provide greater opportunity for children, as middle-aged
adults, to get to better know their parents and empathize
with them, increase the emotional maturity needed by chil-
dren to overcome a legacy of historically weak attachment
styles, or be correlated with children having greater re-
sources and fewer competing demands placed on them.
Whether the inclination to return greater amounts of so-
cial support over time is contingent on processes particular
to old age that lie beyond functional health (such as widow-
hood, retirement, income loss) can only be inferred from the
time trends in the data. It is also not possible for us to know
whether adult children are consciously motivated by an ex-
plicit sense of obligation to reciprocate for past transfers or
whether parents made strategic investments in their children
with the expectation of old-age support. However, the
lagged nature of the exchange is consistent with the notion
that social support is dependent on earlier financial and
emotional investments made by parents when triggered by
dependency. That interactions with health of parent are not
found with regard to slopes should not be surprising be-
cause health of parent was included only as a fixed effect in
the model. The goal remains for future research to specify
which ontogenic changes are most associated with increas-
ing flows of support.
Clearly, economic support from each parent is, in most
cases, a joint transfer from common parental assets. Consis-
tent results on this dimension are reflected in the high corre-
lation between parents in financial transfers made to chil-
dren. Indeed, the correlation between mothers and fathers
(for children who responded about both) was high for all
transfers (.84 for affection, .85 for association, and .82 for
financial), suggesting that it may be more appropriate for re-
searchers to consider the aggregate amount of parental
transfers when parents share a common household.
Evidence that functional limitations act as a trigger of eq-
uity "withdrawal" is found with regard to average levels of
support to mothers as a function of early affection. This
finding suggests that moral capital resides more with frail
older mothers in terms of the proportionate reciprocation to
emotional succor that mothers provided earlier to their chil-
dren. No interactions with health are found in predicting in-
tercepts or slopes in support to fathers. Early bonding with
the maternal figure in the family, so important for the
healthy development of the child, also appears to be at the
heart of what may be called healthy family development in
later life when the physical frailty of parents is most likely
to elevate the importance of supportive kinship ties.
The parental transfer measures, particularly financial, are
weak in several respects. In the absence of indicators of
quantity and quality of financial assistance, we relied on an
ordinal measure. Such a measure is not sensitive to the like-
lihood that the dollar amount and type of the transfer vary
depending on the age of the child. However, in tests we per-
formed of interactions between each of the transfers and the
age and living arrangements of children, we found no evi-
dence that these characteristics condition the relationships
observed. Another issue revolves around the possibility that
measures of transfers are biased because they are subjective
and reflect only the children's perception of the events; chil-
dren may ignore actual transfers or falsely perceive trans-
fers in their absence. The subjective basis of these measures
typically produces biases such that children tend to underes-
timate the magnitude of transfers, although correlations be-
tween the reports of the two generations have been observed
to be high (Giarrusso, Stallings, & Bengtson, 1995).
There are alternative explanations for how transfers be-
tween generations are serially linked that are consistent with
our findings. Fixed personality characteristics and family
culture may determine support flows that give the appear-
ance of reciprocity. Parents may be more giving to children
with "compliant" personalities, who are then more likely to
provide support to their parents as a result of this personal-
ity characteristic. Alternatively, exchanges that are seem-

ingly based on reciprocity may result from a family culture
that governs both partners' transfers to each other (see Hen-
retta et al., 1997). For instance, strong norms of family re-
sponsibility may pervade a family and spuriously drive both
parental transfers and support from children. A fixed effects
model that examines within-family effects would hold such
family effects constant by estimating differential transfer-
return rates for children in the same families. The response
patterns in the Longitudinal Study of Generations did not
permit the identification of such a model. However, we
have, to some degree, remedied the influence of competing
explanations by controlling for education and gender--both
of which are related to norms regarding family support pat-
terns (Silverstein, Parrott, & Bengtson, 1995).
The findings of this investigation illuminate some of the
principles that guide the serial transfer of resources across
generations in the family. The availability of long-term lon-
gitudinal data has enabled us to test models that inform the-
ories of reciprocity and altruism in intergenerational family
relationships. These models also have the potential to high-
light some important policy considerations as well. Econo-
mists (Barro, 1974; Becker, 1974) have pointed out that
public programs that mandate intergenerational transfers,
such as Social Security, are less effective when intergenera-
tional relations operate under principles of reciprocity. If
publicly mandated transfers are too low, altruistic children
will make up the difference with private voluntary contribu-
tions to their parents, keeping the total transfer constant. In
contrast, these public programs will have the greatest effect
on those who are not altruistically motivated, because they
compel even the most reluctant children to transfer (indi-
rectly in this case) at least some resources to their parents. It
would appear that support programs do have a real impact
on older adults, insofar as exchanges are, to some degree,
guided by an intergenerational quid pro quo.
In conclusion, we suggest that the motivation of adult
children to provide social support to their older parents is
rooted in earlier family experiences and guided by an im-
plicit social contract that ensures long-term reciprocity. In-
tergenerational family relationships observe many of the
same exchange dynamics that provide stability to small so-
cial groups. However, the long time lag between investment
and return on investment is what may differentiate ex-
changes in intergenerational relationships from exchanges
in other relationships, such as friendships, where the de-
mand to reciprocate is more immediate. Thus, parents inter-
ested in optimizing their chances of receiving old-age sup-
port would do well to invest in their children well before
they, the parents, reach old age. That even parents with min-
imal investments can expect some support from their chil-
dren further highlights the complexities in understanding
this most fundamental of interpersonal relationships.
