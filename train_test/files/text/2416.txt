Abstract
Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been a deadly pathogen in healthcare settings
since the 1960s, but MRSA epidemiology changed since 1990 with new genetically distinct strain types circulating
among previously healthy people outside healthcare settings. Community-associated (CA) MRSA strains primarily
cause skin and soft tissue infections, but may also cause life-threatening invasive infections. First seen in Australia
and the U.S., it is a growing problem around the world. The U.S. has had the most widespread CA-MRSA epidemic,
with strain type USA300 causing the great majority of infections. Individuals with either asymptomatic colonization
or infection may transmit CA-MRSA to others, largely by skin-to-skin contact. Control measures have focused on
hospital transmission. Limited public health education has focused on care for skin infections.
Methods: We developed a fine-grained agent-based model for Chicago to identify where to target interventions to
reduce CA-MRSA transmission. An agent-based model allows us to represent heterogeneity in population behavior,
locations and contact patterns that are highly relevant for CA-MRSA transmission and control. Drawing on nationally
representative survey data, the model represents variation in sociodemographics, locations, behaviors, and physical
contact patterns. Transmission probabilities are based on a comprehensive literature review.
Results: Over multiple 10-year runs with one-hour ticks, our model generates temporal and geographic trends in
CA-MRSA incidence similar to Chicago from 2001 to 2010. On average, a majority of transmission events occurred
in households, and colonized rather than infected agents were the source of the great majority (over 95%) of
transmission events. The key findings are that infected people are not the primary source of spread. Rather, the far
greater number of colonized individuals must be targeted to reduce transmission.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that current paradigms in MRSA control in the United States cannot be very
effective in reducing the incidence of CA-MRSA infections. Furthermore, the control measures that have focused
on hospitals are unlikely to have much population-wide impact on CA-MRSA rates. New strategies need to be
developed, as the incidence of CA-MRSA is likely to continue to grow around the world.

Introduction
Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of human
bacterial infections. It is generally a commensal organ-
ism, and it is estimated that 25-40% of the population
are colonized in the nasopharynx at any given time.
While colonization is asymptomatic, colonized individ-
uals may develop an active infection [1]. Colonization
may be of short or long duration, and often clears with-
out causing an infection. Transmission is believed to be
largely via skin-to-skin contact with either a colonized
or infected individual. New S. aureus isolates resistant to
-lactam antibiotics were identified in the 1960s among
hospitalized patients [2,3]. Called methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), these isolates rapidly be-
came an important cause of nosocomial infections, par-
ticularly among patients with procedures or devices that
pierce the skin. These are referred to as "health care-
associated" MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains [4].
MRSA epidemiology changed in the 1990s in many
countries when new MRSA strain types that were genetic-
ally distinct from HA-MRSA were diagnosed among indi-
viduals in the community who did not have healthcare
exposures. The transmissibility and types of HA-MRSA
and community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infection
differ [5]. The problem of CA-MRSA has been particularly
severe in the United States, where incidence increased ex-
ponentially in the early 2000s [6]. In the United States,
early reports of CA-MRSA infections came from inner
city populations [7], and outbreaks were reported among
members of contact sports teams, jail detainees, and army
personnel, all in places where people interact in close
quarters [8]. By 2004, one of the CA-MRSA strain types,
USA300, became the most frequent cause of skin and soft
tissue infections seen in U.S. emergency departments [9].
While uncomplicated skin infections are the most com-
mon manifestation, CA-MRSA infections may be invasive
and even fatal.
Public concern about MRSA increased when the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that
in 2005 there were more deaths from invasive MRSA infec-
tions than from HIV-AIDS in the U.S. [10]. While infec-
tions from HA-MRSA strains rarely occur outside of
the healthcare setting, infections caused by CA-MRSA
strain types have become common in hospitals in the
U.S. [8]. Invasive MRSA deaths are caused by both HA-
MRSA and CA-MRSA strain types. Since 2001, several
states enacted laws designed to slow the dissemination of
MRSA, all focused on healthcare settings (Committee to
Reduce Infection Deaths. State Legislation & Initiatives
on Healthcare-Associated Infections. http://www.hospital
infection.org/legislation.shtml). The other public health
response in the U.S. has been educational, such as public
service announcements to raise public awareness of
MRSA infections and to encourage the use of preventive
measures such as the covering of skin lesions to reduce
transmission (STOP MRSA Now. http://www.stopmrsa
now.org/public-service-announcement.html). There are
no major public or private efforts aimed at controlling the
spread of MRSA colonization in the community from per-
son to person in the absence of infection.
Epidemiologic studies can be used to estimate the inci-
dence and risk factors for CA-MRSA infections, or the
prevalence of colonization. However, it is difficult to per-
form a study that examines the actual transmission dynam-
ics of asymptomatic MRSA colonization in any population.
This paper describes the structure and results of a new,
fine-grained agent-based model of CA-MRSA transmission
dynamics and infection in Chicago aimed at augmenting
the value of existing epidemiological data and evaluating
current public policies related to MRSA. Computational
models have become valuable tools in understanding infec-
tious disease dynamics, including assessments of the po-
tential impact of public health interventions such as
isolation, school closures or vaccines. While there have
been small-scale models of HA-MRSA within hospitals
and other resident healthcare facilities [11-18] and exami-
nations of multiple interacting hospitals [19-21], attempts
to model MRSA in the community have been limited
[22,23]. Our model represents the spread of CA-MRSA in
the population of Chicago, for which we have estimates of
temporal and geographic trends based on clinical data
from 2001 to 2010.
We used the model to determine the types of places in
Chicago most important for the transmission of CA-
MRSA, examining places such as households, the County
jail, hospitals, and schools, and the relative contributions
of the colonized and infected states to transmission.
Methods
The baseline data for the model is a synthetic population
developed by Wheaton and others [24] derived from com-
bined U.S. Census files. The sociodemographic attributes
of the synthetic population match that of the enumerated
population in the 2000 Census for Chicago. Each agent
resides in a household and has sociodemographic charac-
teristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, gender, educational at-
tainment, income). Every place in the model, including
households, schools, hospitals and workplaces, has geo-
graphic coordinates (Figure 1). About three million indi-
vidual agents move to and from 1.2 million places on an
hourly basis over a period of up to 10 years. Places are
categorized as having different levels of physical contact,
because MRSA is transmitted primarily by direct skin-to-
skin contact. The risk of transmission to or from an agent
depends on the disease status (uncolonized, colonized or
infected) of other agents co-located at the same time in
the same place and on the overall level of physical contact
that occurs in that type of place.

Agent activities and contacts
CA-MRSA presents challenges for computational epidemi-
ologic modeling that differ from more commonly modeled
diseases that spread in the community, such as influenza,
because MRSA has a colonized state. Modeling CA-MRSA
also means representing individuals' behaviors related to
Figure 1 Places included in Chicago MRSA agent-based model.

disease transmission and response to infection. The kinds
of places that need to be represented in the model also dif-
fer from other diseases. Early outbreaks in urban jails
pointed toward jails [25-27] as potentially playing a key
role in transmission, necessitating their inclusion in a
population-based model.
We combine several publicly available national data
sources to model activities of the synthetic agent popula-
tion. Each agent has a daily activity profile that determines
what times throughout the day he or she occupies each lo-
cation. Social contact between agents occurs when mul-
tiple agents occupy the same location at the same time.
The synthetic population assigns agents to households,
workplaces and schools (for those of school age) [24]. Be-
cause daycare centers are not represented in the synthetic
population, we generated pseudo-daycare centers at the
same geographical locations as the schools in the model
and assigned each agent attending daycare to the closest
one. Since daycare children do not collocate in the same
classrooms as the school children, the exact locations of
the daycare centers do not affect the final results, as long
as they are in the neighborhoods of the children who at-
tend. Each household is randomly assigned three other
households for potential visits from the same census block
group and one household from elsewhere in the city, and
one of these four households is randomly selected when-
ever an agent has an activity in another household (e.g.,
babysitting or socializing). Hospitals and gyms are in the
synthetic population because they are workplaces, but we
assign agents to them for athletic activities and hospitali-
zations, using the geographically closest one. Finally, the
model includes a jail corresponding to the Cook County
Jail (one of the largest jails in the U. S.).
Activity profiles are empirically based on 24-hour time
diaries collected as part of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics' annual American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for indi-
viduals aged 15 years and older and from the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics (PSID) for children younger than
15 years. Both are nationally representative samples and
collected diary data on randomly assigned days. The diary
records each activity during the 24-hour period (start/stop
times, location and others present). We simplify the data,
focusing on features of greatest relevance for MRSA trans-
mission. Each place/activity is categorized according to (1)
the likelihood of physical contact that would increase
transmission probability, and (2) the likelihood of injuries,
cuts and abrasions that would increase the probability of
transition from the colonized to the infected state. Ath-
letic activities, for example, are considered high risk for
both (1) and (2), regardless of where they occur.
Two profiles (one weekday and one weekend) from re-
spondents living in metropolitan areas are assigned to
each agent in the model. This is done by randomly
matching each agent with an ATUS or PSID respondent
who is either identical or similar with respect to sociode-
mographic characteristics. While these profiles are cur-
rently used for the entire model run, it would be
straightforward to incorporate variation in activity pro-
files or other within-agent changes in profiles that re-
spond to disease or other events.
Days spent in hospitals or jail are both relevant for MRSA
transmission but are not included in the time diaries, which
exclude institutionalized individuals. To assign hospital
stays to agents, we use data on hospital nights per year
from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),
matched to agents by sociodemographics. Five matches are
made per agent to be used in successive years, and these
are repeated for ten-year model runs. Hospitalization tim-
ing is random throughout the year. For risk of being
detained in jail, we generate a yearly probability for each
agent so that the total number of admissions and their dis-
tribution by gender, age, race and zip code matches data
from the 2006 National Jail Survey (for Chicago) and the
Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program as
closely as possible. Agents are placed in jail up to once per
year according to this probability, with a length of stay
drawn randomly from the actual distribution at the Cook
County Jail.
Rather than using a mathematically generated contact
network, the contact network is an emergent characteris-
tic of this model, driven by geography and co-
participation in activities [28]. Within each physical loca-
tion, random mixing is assumed to occur among all
present with one exception. Within schools and daycare
centers, children are assigned to compartments of size 30
as a proxy for grade or group, so that their contacts are
limited to other children in the same classroom. Each
hour, four children in the same compartment are ran-
domly selected for direct contact risk. Similarly, individ-
uals detained in the jail are placed in compartments of 30
people. Figure 2 shows the extent to which individuals in
different age groups have contact with individuals by age
group in key types of locations. Each hour, individuals in
the same location are in contact with each other, such that
two individuals in the same house for three hours are con-
sidered three contact events for each of them. Overall, in
a ten-year model run there were 4.125 × 1012 contact
events, an average of 39 contact events per day per agent.
Disease states and transitions
Each agent in the model is in one of three disease states at
any time: colonized (denoted by C), uncolonized (denoted
by U), or infected (denoted by I). Individuals transition be-
tween these states, and individuals return to being suscep-
tible after an infection or colonization, consistent with the
observed frequency of repeat infections [29]. Figure 3 sum-
marizes the disease states and transitions. A probabilistic
discrete-time state transition approach is used to model

change in agent disease states, combined with a discrete
event scheduling approach with estimated distributions for
the duration of time spent in the states involved. Estimated
transition probabilities are used for the transitions U  C,
C  U and C  I, and event scheduling determines
transitions for I  C and I  U. We assume perfect social
mixing among individuals within a given location, except
for schools and jails (as described above).

contact with a colonized or infected individual. We de-
fine the parameter a as the estimated transition prob-
ability of an uncolonized individual (in disease state U)
becoming colonized (transitioning to disease state C)
due to contact for one hour with a colonized individual.
Parameter a is the only disease state transition param-
eter in the model that is the result of physical contact
between individuals. To consider a higher probability of
becoming colonized upon contact with an infected indi-
vidual, we define the Transmission Intensity Parameter
(TIP), which scales the transmission rate. In the base
case, we leave this parameter with a value of 1, but we
investigate the sensitivity of our findings with respect to
this parameter. For sensitivity analyses, the value of TIP,
based on expert judgment of infectious disease physi-
cians (MZD and RSD), is set as twice the transmission
risk per hour when there is contact with an infected ra-
ther than a colonized agent.
The likelihood of transmission also depends on the
amount of physical contact in the place/activity: high,
moderate or negligible. Place/activities are assigned one
of three levels of risk (Figure 3). This scaling factor is
denoted as the Place/Activity Risk parameter (PAR).

the uncolonized to the colonized state.

by place and activity are summarized in the technical ap-
pendix (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Transition from Colonized to Uncolonized State. An
individual may spontaneously become uncolonized, as
the individual's defenses eliminate the bacteria, or may
remain colonized over an extended period. The hourly
probability of a transition is denoted by parameter e, es-
timated as described below:

Transition from Colonized to Infected State. Colo-

sented as parameter b, is estimated as described below.
In the model,
Pr CI
½  ¼ AIP Â b ð3Þ
where b is the probability of a colonized individual becom-
ing infected per hour, and AIP (Activity Infection Param-
eter) is a parameter that reflects the relative likelihood
that a place/activity results in an infection. Activities with
a higher risk of the skin being abraded or punctured (such
as may happen at a sports activity or in a hospital, jail or
daycare center) have elevated risk of infection. We assume
that an individual always passes through the colonized (C)
state prior to becoming infected (I), although this is a
minor assumption as the duration of colonization may be
as brief as one hour.
Transition from Infected to Colonized and Uncolonized
States. Infections vary in length, averaging about two
weeks, based on clinical observations and expert judgment.
An infected individual may seek treatment or care for the
infection without seeking professional medical care. We
collected national survey data through the Time-sharing
Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) to determine
individuals actual and hypothetical care-seeking behavior
in response to MRSA-like skin infections. Individuals con-
sistently reported that they had or would seek clinical care
about half the time (Wilder JR, Wegener D, David MZ,
Macal CM, Daum R, Lauderdale DS: A national survey of
skin infections, care behaviors and MRSA knowledge, sub-
mitted). Almost all MRSA skin infections would resolve
whether or not care is sought, although clinical attention
likely decreases the duration of infection. When the infec-
tion is resolved, the relative likelihood of ceasing to be col-
onized with MRSA may be higher when the infection is
treated with antibiotics by a clinician. Both because clini-
cians may treat infections with antibiotics and because they
would give instructions on how to care for an infection,
the proportion uncolonized after infection is greater for
those who seek professional medical care than those
who do not. These transitions and contingencies are
graphically represented in the behavioral model presented
in Additional file 1: Figure S2 in the technical appendix.
Estimating disease transmission and transition
parameters
We used published data for initial estimates of colonization
rates [30], decolonization rates [31], and infection rates
[32]. We derived household transmission rates from data
described in Miller et al [30]. and used bootstrap resam-
pling methods to calculate confidence intervals, which we
used as plausible ranges for transmission rates in the simu-
lation. Disease state transition parameters are estimated
using a discrete-time Markov chain approach [33].
We then ran the model over the space of plausible
transmission parameters. In doing so we found that some
combinations of transmission parameters produced results
that closely matched the CA-MRSA build-up meta-
analysis estimates [6] that occurred in the period 2001 ­
2010 in Chicago, while others did not. The identification
of transmission parameters is more fully described in the
technical appendix (Additional file 1: Figure S3). The
agent disease state transmission/transition parameters are
shown in Table 1.

Initial conditions
All runs were initialized with the number of infected in-
dividuals at 104 and the number of colonized individuals
at 21,944 for the base year, 2001. The initial number of
infected is consistent with observed data [17]. The num-
ber of colonized individuals is not observed, but is based
on national colonization data in the same year that was
collected as part of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey
collected by the National Center for Health Statistics.
From 2001 through 2004, they included a special assess-
ment of nasal colonization for MRSA [34]. We adjusted
the colonization rate they found to account for an
underestimate because only one body site (nares) was
checked for colonization. Infected and colonized individ-
uals were randomly located in the zip codes that had
MRSA cases in 2001, drawing on data described in Hota
et al. [35].
Modeling behaviors
We developed a flexible framework for modeling behav-
ior of individuals in response to infection, which could
be expanded to include the behavior of healthcare
workers. Based on available evidence [30,31] and expert
opinion, clinical care may reduce the duration of infec-
tion and decrease the probability of being colonized after
the infection resolves. Thus, we permit infected individ-
uals to vary in the likelihood that they seek medical care,
with overall probability estimated from our TESS survey.
The behavioral model is presented in the technical ap-
pendix (Additional file 1: Figure S2).
Model validation
There are generally accepted processes for validating
large-scale simulation models [36]. Validating a social
systems model that contains elements of human behav-
ior to the point of numerical equivalence between model
outputs and observed phenomena is usually not possible
and is generally not considered an attainable goal [37].
Rather, a series of validation tests are performed to
establish credibility for the model for its intended use.
Approaches to validation include establishing face valid-
ity (domain experts' judgmental assessments of model
mechanisms and results), stochastic equivalence (adher-
ence of the distribution of model outputs to estimated
uncertainty ranges for observed data), alternative history
explorations (ability of the model to produce alternate
histories), model falsification (parameter sweeps over a
range of plausible assumptions designed to reveal im-
plausible cases), and model docking (comparing results
of different types of models of the same system). Each of
these approaches was used in the iterative development
of the CA-MRSA ABM. Tests that support the validity
of the model include recorded infection incidence by zip
code [35], jail stay annual data (various sources), hospital
visits annual data (various sources), and colonization
data from diverse studies.
Platform
The ABM is implemented in Repast, a general-purpose
agent-based modeling toolkit. The Repast suite includes
the Java-based Repast Simphony [38] and the C++ -
based Repast for High Performance Computing (HPC)
[39]. The initial CA-MRSA ABM prototype was imple-
mented in Repast Simphony for a small region of three
Chicago zip codes [40]. The prototype was translated
into Repast HPC for large-scale model runs. The CA-
MRSA ABM is designed to run on computing platforms
that include desktop computers, computing clusters
(e.g., the Blues and Fusion clusters at Argonne National
Laboratory), and specialized high performance com-
puters (e.g., the IBM Blue Gene class of machines at
Argonne National Laboratory).
Stochastic variability
The CA-MRSA ABM is inherently a stochastic model,
with random variation affecting both disease transmission
(uncolonized to colonized transition) and transition (the
length of time in the colonized or infected states). To prop-
erly characterize uncertainty requires that, for each case
run with the model, multiple simulations be run in which
the initializing random number seeds are varied. Studies
are described in the technical appendix of the appropriate
number of simulation runs to characterize uncertainty of
the model outputs (Additional file 1: Figure S5). The re-
sults show that the moving average of the estimated vari-
ance decreases continuously from 15 to about 28 runs and
then stabilizes, indicating that batch sizes of a minimum of
28 runs are adequate to estimate of model output statistics.
Results presented here are based on 32 runs, which was
found to adequately characterize the inherent uncertainty
in the model.

Results
Figure 4 shows the meta-analysis estimate of the actual
CA-MRSA trend in Chicago from 2001 to 2010 in red
[6], which has been adjusted for an underestimate be-
cause the incidence data derive from clinical records
only includes MRSA infected patients who seek medical
care. The yellow band is a point-wise 95% C.I. represent-
ing uncertainty around the Chicago incidence estimate.
The blue band corresponds to the results from 32 model
runs using the best fitting transmission parameters, and
its width indicates variability over the runs. The narrow-
ness of this blue interval demonstrates that, at least
point-wise, there is little stochastic variability in the re-
sults of the model (conditional on these values of the pa-
rameters), and the vast majority of the variation in
Figure 4 is due to intentional variation in the values of
the model parameters.
Over the same years, cases were observed to spread
from the initial concentration in inner city neighbor-
hoods to a more diffuse pattern across the city. Figure 5
shows the model output by zip code and year, with the
diameter of the circles indicating the numbers of newly
colonized agents (larger orange circles) and incident in-
fections (smaller red circles) in each zip code by year.
During the first five years, there is a spread from a small
number of zip codes to a citywide problem, and the pat-
tern then remains similar for the last five years.
Over each ten-year run, there were about 2.1 × 106
new colonization events, or 72 colonization events per
1000 person-years, and there were about 116,000 new
infections, or about 4 per 1000 person-years. Among the
2.1 × 106 new colonizations, 98.6 percent were the result
of contact with a colonized individual and 1.4 percent
were the result of contact with an infected individual.
By far the most common geographic location for
colonization transmission events was households (in-
cluding both an individual's own household and ones
they visited), accounting for 65.1 percent of newly colo-
nized agents. Schools or daycare centers were the next
most frequent, accounting for 15.8 percent. Hospitals
accounted for only 7.8 percent of newly colonized
agents. Initial reports of CA-MRSA outbreaks in the
early 2000s came from jails and sports teams. However,
jails and athletic activities were less frequent locations
for new colonizations, accounting for 2.9 percent and
5.6 percent, respectively (Table 2).
Sensitivity analyses
A set of experiments was designed to test the robustness
and sensitivity of the model results to three types of pa-
rameters whose initial values were set based on expert
judgment. (1) Different types of places provide oppor-
tunities for lesser and greater levels of physical contact,
and the Base Case values reflected those differences.
PAR indicates the relative likelihood of physical contact
between individuals at various places, with PAR >1 indi-
cating relatively more contact. For sensitivity analysis,
the value of PAR did not vary by place. (2) Individuals
with active infections may be more likely to spread
colonization than colonized individuals. TIP allows in-
fected individuals to be more likely (TIP > 1) to spread
colonization than colonized individuals. Sensitivity ana-

to transition from the colonized to infected states be-
cause of increased likelihood of cuts and bruises. The
parameter AIP is applied to the transition parameter e
to indicate activities that are more likely (AIP > 1) to re-
sult in self-infection. Sensitivity analyses did not vary
AIP by place. In summary, we carried out sensitivity
analyses to test the effects of varying the values of PAR,
TIP and AIP.
Table 3 shows the values of PAR, TIP and AIP for sen-
sitivity analyses. Table 4 shows the results of the sensitiv-
ity analyses. There is little variation in the proportion of
all disease transition events that are colonization events
across all cases (column 2). Compared the Base Case,
the AIP Sensitivity Case shows the greatest change, an
increase from 94.6% to 96.9%. Such an increase is not
surprising for this case as it reduces the probability of
individuals transitioning from the colonized to infected
states in physically active places.

There is greater variation in the portion of colonization
events that occurs in households (column 3) across all
sensitivity analyses. The largest contrast to the Base Case
is when the PAR is set to 1 in all places. Then the propor-
tion of new colonizations that take place in households is
greatly reduced, although still a majority (53.9% compared
to 72.9%). However, the assumption that all places are
equally likely to provide opportunity for skin-to-skin con-
tact, which is generally thought to be necessary for trans-
mission, is not plausible.
Discussion
Using a novel fine-grained agent-based model of the
population of Chicago, we found that the great majority of
new CA-MRSA colonization events occurred in house-
holds, where most individuals spend substantial time and
have a relatively high level of physical contact with others.
Schools and daycare centers played the largest role in
spreading colonization among households. Although out-
breaks in jails and sports teams were prominently featured
in early reports about CA-MRSA, over the course of the
ten-year runs of the model, they are responsible for
relatively low percentages of new colonization events.
Nonetheless, athletic activities of all kinds did account for
more than five percent of colonization events and could
have a high attributable risk for individuals who engage in
athletic activities. During the first five years (2001 ­ 2005)
model results show spread from a small number of zip
codes concentrated on the south and west sides of the city
to citywide incidence, and that pattern remains similar for
the next five years (2006 ­ 2010). These data are consist-
ent with the findings of Hota et al. [35].
We also found that the overwhelming majority of new
colonizations are the result of a contact with a colonized
individual rather than an infected individual, even when
we set the probability of transmission as twice as great
when a susceptible individual spends time with an in-
fected person, compared with a colonized person. How-
ever, since colonization is so much more common than
infection and lasts much longer, an intervention which
focuses solely on clinically apparent infections to reduce
transmission is unlikely to have much impact on overall
incidence. These results suggest that a particularly effect-
ive intervention might be one that prevented transmission
from asymptomatic MRSA carriers within households to
their household contacts. These findings challenge current
public policy in the U.S., which focuses on the control of
MRSA in the healthcare setting or among people with
active infections.
Our model has several novel features that represent
important aspects of the epidemiology of CA-MRSA and
its transmission. Time is represented at the hourly level
allowing us to incorporate detailed empirical time-use
data into the model. Space is represented by geo-located
place, and the contact network is an emergent character-
istic of agents located in the same physical places. We
have used the census sociodemographic characteristics
of agents (i.e., age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, years in
school, employment status and household income) to
probabilistically link activity profiles and probabilities of
hospitalization and jail detention to agents. In addition,
the places/activities are graded with respect both to the
level of direct physical contact likely to occur there,
which affects the transition from the uncolonized to the
colonized state (conditional on an individual with MRSA
being in the same location), and to the likelihood of skin
abrasions or punctures, which affects an individual's
transition from the colonized to the infected state. We
have shown that the outputs of the model are similar to
the temporal and geographic trends in CA-MRSA inci-
dence in Chicago. This does not directly validate the
transmission parameters or the contact network. How-
ever, the similarity of our model output to the descrip-
tive epidemiology of CA-MRSA in Chicago will allow us
to use the model to estimate the magnitude of likely ef-
fects both of public health and clinical interventions that

have been implemented ­ generally without evidence ­ and
of interventions that may be implemented in the future.
Our findings suggest that novel public health approaches
are needed to decrease the dissemination of CA-MRSA.
The most effective interventions would prevent transmis-
sion from asymptomatically colonized people to their
household contacts.
The most prominent type of public health intervention
aimed at the control of MRSA transmissions to date has
been the laws passed by some states that mandate
screening and isolation procedures for patients entering
hospitals. With only 7.8 percent of new colonizations es-
timated to occur in hospitals, this approach will have
limited impact and concentrates resources on a type of
location that seems to be responsible for less than one-
tenth of transmissions.
Nevertheless the model has limitations. The results
from any model are conditional on the assumptions
made in deriving the model relations and on the data
employed for that purpose. Some of these assumptions
concern phenomena in part that are not directly observ-
able, such as the number of people colonized with CA-
MRSA. In the CA-MRSA ABM, the assumptions cover
the three main model areas: contact, transmission, and
behavior. We assume the activity profiles and time use
surveys upon which the contact model is based, which
are national in scope, are applicable to the Chicago area.
We assume that assigning activity profiles based on
demographic characteristics adequately captures the
relevant heterogeneity in behavior, and that people con-
tinue in these activity patterns throughout the period
covered by the simulation. We assume that the rules for
matching people to associated hospitals, the jail, schools,
and workplaces reflect a reasonable approximation to
the real world. We assume that CA-MRSA transmission
can be modeled accurately at the fine-grained compart-
ment level based on agents' behaviors and "micro-inter-
actions," such as skin contact based on co-location, and
we assume random mixing among individuals at each lo-
cation at the same time. These assumptions are explicit
in the model, and can be easily modified as new data or
alternate hypotheses become available and as the pro-
cesses mentioned above are better understood. In the fu-
ture, it will be possible to further justify these assumptions
or modify them as necessary, thereby increasing the accur-
acy of the model and our confidence in its predictions as
we experiment with novel interventions.
Conclusions
In summary, our novel agent-based model of CA-MRSA
in a large U.S. city demonstrated that current interven-
tions aimed at controlling the spread of MRSA are un-
likely to succeed in reducing overall CA-MRSA incidence.
According to the results of our model, the most effective
control strategy would be one that reduces CA-MRSA
transmission within households, particularly from colo-
nized to uncolonized contacts. Our findings suggest that
current paradigms in MRSA control in the United States
cannot be very effective in reducing the incidence of CA-
MRSA infections. Furthermore, the control measures that
have focused on hospitals are unlikely to have much
population-wide impact on CA-MRSA rates. New strat-
egies need to be developed, as the incidence of CA-MRSA
is likely to continue to grow around the world.
