Objective: To describe the prevalence of refractive er-
ror in the United States.
Methods: The 1999-2004 National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES) used an autorefrac-
tor to obtain refractive error data on a nationally repre-
sentative sample of the US noninstitutionalized, civilian
population 12 years and older. Using data from the eye
with a greater absolute spherical equivalent (SphEq) value,
we defined clinically important refractive error as fol-
lows: hyperopia, SphEq value of 3.0 diopters (D) or
greater; myopia, SphEq value of -1.0 D or less; and astig-
matism, cylinder of 1.0 D or greater in either eye.
Results: Of 14 213 participants 20 years or older who
completed the NHANES, refractive error data were ob-
tained for 12 010 (84.5%). The age-standardized preva-
lences of hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatism were 3.6%
(95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2%-4.0%), 33.1% (95%
CI, 31.5%-34.7%), and 36.2% (95% CI, 34.9%-37.5%),
respectively. Myopia was more prevalent in women
(39.9%) than in men (32.6%) (P.001) among 20- to
39-year-old participants. Persons 60 years or older were
less likely to have myopia and more likely to have hy-
peropia and/or astigmatism than younger persons. Myo-
pia was more common in non-Hispanic whites (35.2%)
than in non-Hispanic blacks (28.6%) or Mexican Ameri-
cans (25.1%) (P.001 for both).
Conclusion: Estimates based on the 1999-2004 NHANES
vision examination data indicate that clinically impor-
tant refractive error affects half of the US population 20
years or older.

METHODS
The NHANES is an ongoing nationally repre-
sentative survey of the US civilian, noninsti-
tutionalized population conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion.8,9 Participants in NHANES undergo a
home interview and subsequent comprehen-
sive physical examination and functional as-
sessment in a mobile examination center
(MEC).8 The 1999-2004 NHANES protocol was
reviewed and approved by the NCHS Re-
search Ethics Review Board. All participants
(and parents or guardians of minors) gave their
written informed consent after receiving a de-
scription of the study and the potential risks
of participation.
Demographic characteristics were col-
lected at the household interview. Partici-
pants reported their ethnicity and race.10 The
NCHS later categorized these classifications into
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, Mexi-
can American, or other (including Asian [vari-
ous countries], Pacific Islander, Native Ameri-
can, non­Mexican American Hispanic, and
multiracial).
The vision examination was conducted on
participants 12 years and older. An autorefrac-
tor (NIDEK ARK-760; Nidek Co Ltd, Tokyo,
Japan) was used to measure the refractive er-
ror of each eye after corrective lenses had been
removed. Three separate measurements of
sphere, cylinder, and axis were acquired and

averaged by the autorefractor. For myopia and hyperopia, we
categorized participants based on the refractive error measure-
ments from the eye with the larger absolute spherical equiva-
lent (SphEq) value. If one eye had missing refractive error data,
data from the eye with available data were used. Refractions
were recorded in plus cylinder notation, and the SphEq value
was computed as the sphere measurement plus half the cylin-
der measurement. Clinically important myopia was defined as
a myopic SphEq value of at least -1.0 diopter (D); clinically im-
portant hyperopia was defined as a hyperopic SphEq value of
3.0 D or more. Severe myopia was defined as a myopic SphEq
value of at least -5.0 D.11,12 We also present data with myopia
defined as a SphEq value of at least -0.5 D. Astigmatism was
defined as a cylinder of 1.0 D or greater in the eye with the larger
cylinder value.
Because of time constraints imposed by the comprehensive
NHANES, it was not feasible to obtain cycloplegic refractions.
Accommodation may, therefore, have affected the measure-
ment of the refractive error, particularly in younger partici-
pants, despite the autofogging used by the autorefractor to mini-
mize accommodation. Consequently, for persons aged 12
through 19 years, the prevalence of myopia is likely to be over-
estimated and the prevalence of hyperopia is likely to be un-
derestimated by the autorefractor measurements. We there-
fore have not used refractive error data from the 1999-2004
NHANES for estimating the prevalence of refractive error among
persons aged 12 through 19 years.
Refractive error data obtained from eyes with a history of
cataract surgery or refractive surgery, or in which contact lenses
were worn during objective refraction, were treated as miss-
ing values. Participants excluded from analyses (n=2203) were
those who reported a history of cataract surgery (n=791) or
refractive surgery (n=142) in both eyes, those who wore con-
tact lenses during objective refraction (n=19), and those who
were missing autorefractor data for both eyes (n=1251, be-
cause of lack of time, inability to cooperate with the protocol,
or equipment malfunction). We included 615 participants with
refractive error data for only 1 eye (the other eye had cataract
extraction [n=264], refractive surgery [n=21], or missing au-
torefractor [n=330] data).
NHANES uses a complex, multistage probability sample de-
sign with oversampling within selected demographic sub-
groups.13 Sampling weights derived by NCHS statisticians re-
flect the probability of selection into the sample and incorporate
adjustments for differential nonresponse and poststratifica-
tion,14,15 and their incorporation into analyses16 (using SUDAAN
statistical software, version 9.0.0; Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) ensures that the
weighted estimates reflect the US population sizes for speci-
fied demographic categories and that standard errors are un-

US Census population.19
RESULTS
A total of 14 213 participants 20 years and older partici-
pated in the 1999-2004 NHANES MEC examination. Of
these, 12 010 (84.5%) had complete refractive error data
(Table 1). Participants with incomplete refractive er-
ror data were more likely to be older and female, to re-
port a lower annual income, and to have fewer years of
formal education.
The distribution of SphEq refraction by age is shown
in the Figure. Participants 60 years and older were less
likely to have myopic refractive error and more likely to
have hyperopic refractive error than younger individuals.
HYPEROPIA
The prevalence of hyperopia (SphEq value 3.0 D)
(Table 2) for participants aged 20 through 39 years, 40
through 59 years, and 60 years and older was 1.0% (95%
confidenceinterval[CI],0.6%-1.4%),2.4%(95%CI,1.7%-
3.0%), and 10.0% (95% CI, 9.1%-10.9%), respectively.
In persons 60 years and older, hyperopia was more com-
mon in women (12.9%) than in men (6.6%) (P.001).
MYOPIA
The overall pattern of myopia prevalence by age and sex
was similar, regardless of the definition of myopia (-1.0
D, -0.5 D, or -5.0 D): prevalence estimates were ap-
proximately equal for the 20- through 39-year-old and
40- through 59-year-old groups and markedly lower for
those 60 years and older; for those 20 through 39 years
old, women had a higher prevalence than men. For myo-
pia defined as a SphEq value of -1.0 D or less (Table 3),
prevalence estimates for participants aged 20 through 39
years, 40 through 59 years, and 60 years and older were
36.2% (95% CI, 34.2%-38.3%), 37.6% (95% CI, 35.1%-
40.1%), and 20.5% (95% CI, 18.3%-22.8%), respec-
tively. Myopia of -1.0 D or less was more prevalent in
non-Hispanic whites (35.2%) than in non-Hispanic blacks
(28.6%) or Mexican Americans (25.1%) (P.001 for
both). For those 60 years and older, no differences in
prevalence were observed among race/ethnicity catego-
ries or between men and women. For participants aged
20 through 39 years and 40 through 59 years, the preva-
lence of myopia of -1.0 D or less was higher for non-
Hispanic whites (38.7% and 40.6%, respectively) than for
non-Hispanic blacks (32.0% and 32.1%, respectively;
P .001 for both) or Mexican Americans (27.1% and
26.4%, respectively; P.001 for both). For those aged
20 through 39 years, women had a slightly higher preva-
lence of myopia of -1.0 D or less (39.9%) than did men
(32.6%) (P.001).
The prevalence of myopia defined as an SphEq value of
-0.5 D or less (Table 4) for participants aged 20through
39 years, 40 through 59 years, and 60 years and older was
50.2% (95% CI, 47.8%-52.7%), 50.1% (95% CI, 47.8%-
52.4%), and 26.5% (95% CI, 24.0%-29.0%), respectively.
Myopia of -0.5 D or less was most prevalent in those cat-
egorized as non-Hispanic white (46.0%) compared with
those categorized as non-Hispanic black (41.5%, P=.003)
or Mexican American (40.8%, P .001). The prevalence
of myopia of -0.5 D or less did not differ significantly be-

for whom the prevalence in women (53.9%) was signifi-
cantly higher than in men (46.6%) (P .001).
The prevalence of severe myopia (SphEq value -5.0
D) (Table 5) for participants aged 20 through 39 years,
40 through 59 years, and 60 years and older was 7.4%
(95% CI, 6.5%-8.3%), 7.8% (95% CI, 6.4%-9.1%), and
3.1% (95% CI, 2.2%-3.9%), respectively. Severe myopia
was most prevalent in those categorized as non-
Hispanic white (7.0%) compared with non-Hispanic
blacks (4.7%, P=.001) and Mexican Americans (3.6%,
P.001). The prevalence of severe myopia did not dif-
fer significantly between men and women, except in those
aged 20 through 39 years, for whom the prevalence in
women (9.2%) was significantly higher than in men
(5.6%) (P.001).
ASTIGMATISM
The prevalence of astigmatism (Table 6) increased with
increasing age: for ages 20 through 39 years, 40 through
59 years, and 60 years and older, prevalence estimates
were 23.1% (95% CI, 21.6%-24.5%), 27.6% (95% CI,
25.8%-29.3%), and 50.1% (95% CI, 48.2%-52.0%), re-

ANY CLINICALLY IMPORTANT
REFRACTIVE ERROR
The prevalence of any clinically important refractive er-
ror (myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism) (eTable;
available at: http://www.archophthalmol.com) in-
creased with increasing age. Prevalence estimates for par-
ticipants aged 20 through 39 years, 40 through 59 years,
and 60 years and older were 46.3% (95% CI, 44.5%-
48.0%), 50.6% (95% CI, 48.1%-53.0%), and 62.7% (95%
CI, 60.3%-65.1%), respectively. The prevalence of any
clinically important refractive error was lower for Mexi-
can Americans (44.4%) than for non-Hispanic whites
(53.4%, P.001) or non-Hispanic blacks (49.3%,
P=.002). For those 60 years and older, the prevalence
of any clinically important refractive error was higher in
men (66.8%) than in women (59.2%) (P .001).

pia was 33%; of severe myopia, 6.5%; of hyperopia, 3.6%;
and of astigmatism, 36%. Our estimated prevalence of
myopia was higher than the 25% reported in previous
US studies11,20 and similar (in persons 40 years) to that
of ethnic Chinese persons in Singapore.12 General over-
all statements regarding the distribution of myopia among
demographic subgroups cannot be made because we
found statistically significant interactions between age and
sex (P.001) and between age and race/ethnicity
(P.001), as well as a borderline statistically signifi-
cant interaction between sex and race/ethnicity (P=.07).
Overall, it appears that the pattern of myopia preva-
lence by age is similar, regardless of the definition of myo-
pia, with nearly identical prevalence estimates within the
20- to 39-year and 40- to 59-year age groups and a mark-
edly lower prevalence for those 60 years and older (ap-
proximately half that for the younger ages). Sex differ-
ences in myopia prevalence were observed within the
20- to 39-year age group, in whom myopia (SphEq value
-1.0 D) was more prevalent in women (40%) than in
men (33%) (P.001); the same pattern was observed for
myopia defined as an SphEq value of -0.5 D or less
(P .001) and for myopia defined as an SphEq value of
-5.0 D or less (P.001). The prevalence of myopia of
-0.5 D or less was similar to that found in studies of Asian
populations.12 Sex differences in refractive error preva-
lence were also observed within the 60 years or older
group, in whom hyperopia was more common (13% vs
7%; P.001) and astigmatism less common (46% vs 66%;
P.001) among women than among men. The preva-
lence of refractive error varied by age, with those 60 years
and older being less likely to have myopia (P.001 for
all myopia definitions) and more likely to have hyper-
opia (P.001) and/or astigmatism (P.001) than
younger persons. Although hyperopia and astigmatism
prevalence did not vary among race/ethnicity catego-
ries, myopia prevalence was higher in non-Hispanic whites
than in non-Hispanic blacks (38.7% vs 28.6%; P.001)
or Mexican Americans (38.7% vs 25.1%; P.001) (al-
though this race/ethnicity difference was not apparent
in those 60 years).
Most previous epidemiologic studies that provide
prevalence estimates for refractive error were limited to
a specific geographic location or age group. The 1971-
1972 NHANES provided the first US-wide population-
based prevalence estimates for many eye conditions, in-
cluding refractive error. Sperduto et al20 found that the
prevalence of myopia in the United States in persons aged
12 to 54 years was approximately 25% (right eye, based
on lensometry [for those with visual acuity of 20/40 or
better] or on retinoscopy [for those with worse visual acu-
ity]) compared with 33.1% in the current study (in per-
sons 20 years). The prevalence estimates for myopia
are substantially higher for both non-Hispanic black and
non-Hispanic white participants in 1999-2004 (28.6% and
35.2%, respectively) than in 1971-1972 (13.0% and 26.3%,
respectively). It is possible that myopia prevalence in the
United States has increased during the 30-year period be-
tween the 2 NHANES studies. A previous study21 docu-
mented an increased prevalence of myopia during a 12-
year period in young Israeli adults and attributed it to a
possible cohort effect. However, because of consider-
able differences in the methods used to define myopia
in the 2 NHANES studies, additional research would be
required to conclude that prevalence of myopia had in-
creased and, if so, to explore possible reasons for such
an increase.
Recently, the Eye Disease Prevalence Research Group
(EDPRG) performed a meta-analysis of existing popu-
lation-based studies in persons 40 years or older (con-
ducted from 1985 to 2000) to derive robust population
estimates for the prevalence of refractive error in the
United States and other countries.11 Definitions of hy-
peropia, myopia, and severe myopia were the same as in

our study. Our NHANES-based estimate of prevalence
of myopia in the United States for persons 40 years and
older was 31.0% (95% CI, 29.1%-32.9%), which is sub-
stantially higher than the EDPRG estimate for the United
States (25.4%; 95% CI, 24.5%-26.4%). The prevalence
of myopia was higher in the recent NHANES study than
in the EDPRG for both non-Hispanic blacks and non-
Hispanic whites.
The prevalence of myopia of -0.5 D or less in the
current study was 41.0% for persons 40 years and older.
Wong et al12 found a similar prevalence of myopia
(38.7%) in ethnic Chinese persons living in Singapore.
However, the prevalence of severe myopia in the cur-
rent study was lower (6.0%) than that found by Wong
et al (9.1%), possibly attributable to differences in the
age structure of the 2 populations because the United
States may have more older individuals (who have a
relatively lower prevalence of myopia) than Singapore.
Our estimated prevalence of myopia of -0.5 D or less
for persons 60 years and older was 26.5%, greater than
the 19.5% estimated from the Rotterdam Study22 (per-
sons 55 years). The prevalence of myopia in the Blue
Mountains Eye Study23 was 15%, which is strikingly
lower than the prevalence of myopia of -0.5 D or less
found in the current NHANES and that reported from
the Beaver Dam Eye Study.24 The Blue Mountains Eye
Study and Rotterdam Study populations may have a dif-
ferent distribution of underlying risk factors for myopia
that could explain their lower prevalence estimates, but
we are unable to address this issue within the scope of
the current study.
Our myopia prevalence estimates for non-Hispanic
black participants aged 40 through 59 years (32.1%; 95%
CI, 28.1%-36.1%) were also higher than those reported
by the Barbados Eye Study25 (conducted from 1987
through 1992) for participants aged 40 through 59 years
(9%). Our prevalence estimates for myopia in those 60
years and older appear comparable to those reported from
the Barbados Eye Study.
The EDPRG results for Hispanic individuals were
based on a single study4 in a Mexican American popu-
lation (Proyecto Ver [Nogales, Arizona]). Recently,
the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES)26 reported
prevalence estimates of myopia for Hispanic persons
40 years and older (90% of whom reported Mexican
ancestry27). For those aged 40 through 59 years, the
prevalence of myopia among NHANES Mexican
American participants was higher than in their LALES
and EDPRG counterparts. For those 60 years and
older, NHANES and LALES prevalences were similar
and higher than those from the EDPRG.
It is not possible for us to compare results for "other"
race/ethnicity with previous studies because this cat-
egory includes participants with a wide range of ances-
tries and NHANES does not provide data to allow fur-
ther differentiation within this subgroup. However,
because the NHANES sample as a whole is designed to
represent the entire US population, it is important to in-
clude the other subgroup in calculating estimates for the
entire US population.
We found that the prevalence of myopia was lowest
in participants 60 years and older, consistent with other
population-based studies.28,29 Although it is possible that
the lower prevalence of myopia in those 60 years and older
is because of a cohort effect, as reported in other, younger
populations,21,30 this observation may also be because of
intrinsic, age-related changes in the refractive compo-
nents of the eye.31,32
The observed lower prevalence of myopia in persons
60 years and older may also in part be because of an
association of cataract surgery (a criterion for exclusion)
with myopic refractive status.33 Because we have no
information on the refractive status of participants
before cataract surgery, we are unable to explore this
hypothesis.
Our study has several important limitations. Because
of time constraints and potential for participant fatigue,
we could not perform a full ophthalmic examination on
all participants in the MEC. Our study protocol, there-
fore, included the use of an autorefractor, operated ac-
cording to a standard protocol by trained operators. Our
noncycloplegic refraction values were based on the mean
of 3 measurements by the autorefractor and did not in-
clude subjective refinement. This may have resulted in
overestimates of the true number with myopia,34 espe-
cially among younger participants, who have a higher am-
plitude of accommodation. Because of this concern, we
did not use the 1999-2004 NHANES data to provide preva-
lence estimates of refractive error for those aged 12
through 19 years.
As in the EDPRG, we categorized participants based
on the refractive characteristics of the eye with a greater
absolute SphEq value, resulting in an estimated myopia
prevalence of 32.99% (95% CI, 31.47%-34.52% [based
on 5709 individuals]). If we had considered an indi-
vidual as myopic if either eye was myopic,35 we would
have classified an additional 15 participants as myopic,
resulting in a prevalence of 33.05% (95% CI, 31.52%-
34.58%).
Although the NHANES sampling weights correct for
nonresponse within population subgroups, it is pos-
sible that NHANES participants who had vision data had
different refractive characteristics than those who did not
have vision data. Response rates to the home interview
and MEC examination were lower in older individu-
als.36 Participants who reported for the MEC examina-
tion may have had missing vision data because of equip-
ment malfunction or inability to cooperate with the
examination.
Because refractive error's effect on visual acuity
can be mitigated relatively easily, it has sometimes
been overlooked as an important cause of visual
impairment.37,38 Many previous epidemiologic stud-
ies39 based definitions of visual impairment on best-
corrected rather than presenting (ie, with habitual cor-
rection) visual acuity. However, newer research40,41
has focused attention on the benefits of correcting
refractive error. A recent analysis7(p1760) found that
much of the economic burden posed by vision disor-
ders is because of refractive error, concluding that
"interventions to diagnose and treat uncorrected
refractive error have the potential to be highly cost-
effective based on the improvements in patient quality
of life they generate."

In summary, the 1999-2004 NHANES data show that
half of the US population 20 years and older has some
type of clinically important refractive error. Refractive er-
ror is, therefore, the most common condition affecting
the ocular health of the US population, involving young
adults, middle-aged persons, and older adults of all eth-
nicities. In a previous study,6 we estimated the annual
direct cost of providing refractive correction to the 100
million people who need it to achieve good vision as ex-
ceeding $3.5 billion (not including the costs of identi-
fying those who need refractive correction). Others es-
timated the economic burden (including indirect costs)
of refractive error in those 40 years and older to be $5.5
billion.7 Accurate, current estimates of the prevalence of
refractive error are essential for projecting vision care
needs and planning for provision of vision care services
to the many people affected.
