Introduction
The physiological actions of aldosterone, primarily in epi-
thelial cells, include the regulation of electrolytic balance,
followed by water osmosis. In addition, aldosterone is con-
sidered to play an important role in the homeostasis of
blood pressure.1
A high dietary sodium intake is positively correlated with
hypertension, which is a known risk factor for cardiovascular
disease.2 However, restricted dietary sodium intake, although
it reduces blood pressure, is associated with activation of the
renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system (RAAS), and with an
increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).3
Dietary sodium restriction has previously been shown to
accelerate atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient
(E0) mice, which was correlated with an increase in angio-
tensin II (AngII) and plasma cholesterol levels.4 We have
recently shown5 that a low-salt diet (LSD) increased serum
aldosterone levels, macrophages inflammation and lesion
size in E0 mice. LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor
knockout mice subjected to a LSD were also shown to have
increased plasma renin concentrations and renal expres-
sion.6 Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
was recently shown to reduce serum aldosterone levels, and
attenuate aortic inflammatory gene expression and athero-
sclerotic plaque accumulation in E0 mice fed a LSD.7

Abstract
Introduction: A low-sodium diet (LSD) was shown to increase both angiotensin II (AngII) and aldosterone levels, and to
accelerate atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (E0) mice. The aim of the present study was to examine whether
accelerated atherosclerosis in E0 mice fed a LSD is mediated by aldosterone, using the mineralocorticoid receptor
blocker, eplerenone (Epl).
Methods and Results: Mice were divided into three groups: normal diet (ND), LSD and LSD treated with Epl at 100 mg/
kg per day (LSD+Epl) for 10 weeks. LSD significantly enhanced plasma renin and aldosterone levels, which were further
increased in mice fed LSD+Epl. The aortic lesion area increased three-fold with LSD, while LSD+Epl significantly reduced
the lesion area to values similar to ND. Serum and peritoneal macrophages obtained from LSD-fed mice exhibited pro-
atherogenic properties including increased inflammation, oxidation and cholesterol accumulation, which were inhibited
in mice fed LSD+Epl. In a J774A.1 macrophage-like cell line stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, Epl was shown to have a
direct anti-inflammatory effect.
Conclusion: In E0 mice, Epl inhibited LSD-accelerated atherosclerosis, despite the elevation of renin and aldosterone lev-
els. It is therefore suggested that the atherogenic action of LSD could be mediated, at least in part, by activation of the
mineralocorticoid receptor. In addition, eplerenone may have direct anti-inflammatory actions.

High aldosterone levels have been reported to be asso-
ciated with increased rates of CVD.8,9 The adverse effects
of dietary sodium restriction on the cardiovascular func-
tion could be attributed to aldosterone, via the mineralo-
corticoid receptor (MR). The MR blockers spironolactone,
and the more specific eplerenone, were shown to improve
cardiovascular function and enhance survival in patients
with CVD. 10,11 In animals with normal serum aldosterone
levels, eplerenone has also been shown to inhibit athero-
sclerosis12 and reduce oxidative stress.13 However, the
beneficial effects of MR blockers on oxidative stress in
macrophages were only partial when mice were adminis-
tered high levels of exogenous aldosterone.14 As a sodium-
restricted diet was shown to increase both AngII and
aldosterone, the accelerated atherosclerosis induced by a
LSD could result from the direct effect of AngII or could
be due to the effect of aldosterone, which is downstream
to AngII on the RAAS axis. Thus, the aim of the present
study was to examine the role of aldosterone and/or MR
activation in LSD-induced accelerated atherosclerosis by
antagonizing aldosterone using the MR blocker eplerenone
in E0 mice.
Methods
Mice
Three-month-old E0 mice were randomly divided into
three groups (n=6 per group). One group received regu-
lar chow diet and served as control (ND). The other two
groups received a low-salt chow diet (LSD) containing
less than 0.01% sodium (TD90228, Harlan Teklad,
Indianapolis, IN, USA); one of these two groups also
received 100 mg/kg per day eplerenone in the drinking
water (LSD+Epl). Mice were treated for 12 weeks. Three
weeks before the end of the experiment, mice were put in
metabolic cages for two consecutive days for urine col-
lection. Blood, mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM),
kidneys, adrenal glands and aortas were harvested at the
end of the experiment.
The animal study protocol was approved by the
Committee for the Supervision of Animal Experiments of
the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology and was
conducted in accordance with the Israeli law regulating
animal care.
Histopathology of aortic atherosclerotic
lesions
The heart and entire aorta were rapidly dissected out and
immersion-fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L
sodium cacodylate buffer with 0.01% calcium chloride,
pH 7.4 at room temperature. Preparation of the lesion sec-
tions and histomorphometric analysis have been described
previously.14
Serum and urine analyses
Serum electrolytes and lipids were determined using com-
mercial kits (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Aldosterone levels were determined using a commercial radi-
oimmunoassay (RIA) kit (Coat-a-count aldosterone; DPC,
Los Angeles, CA, USA). Plasma renin activity (PRA) was
determined using a commercial RIAkit (DiaSorin, Stillwater,
MN, USA). Renal function was assessed by measuring urine
and plasma creatinine and calculating the glomerular filtra-
tion rate (GFR) according to the following formula: urine
concentration × urine volume × plasma concentration-1.
Blood pressure (BP) measurement
BP was measured in conscious mice with a tail-cuff (five
measurements per mouse) linked to an IITC-229 NIBP
System and computer software IITC-31 (Life Science
Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA, USA).
Serum lipid peroxidation
To determine serum lipid peroxidation, serum samples
were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in the absence or pres-
ence of 100 mM 2,2-azobis-2-amidinopropane hydrochlo-
ride (AAPH; Wako Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for
2 hours. AAPH is a water-soluble azo compound that ther-
mally decomposes to produce peroxyl radicals at a constant
rate. Plasma lipid peroxide content was determined using
the thiobarbituric reactive substance assay.15
Macrophage cell culture
MPM isolation. Mice were injected with 3 ml phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) intraperitoneally. MPMs were har-
vested from the peritoneal fluid, washed three times with
PBS and resuspended to 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomy-
cin, and 2 mM glutamine. The cells were plated on 1.5 mm
coverslips pre-coated with fetal calf serum. Cells were
incubated in a humidified incubator (5% CO2
, 95% air) for
2 hours then washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle
medium to remove non-adherent cells. Monolayers were
incubated for another 18 hours prior to assay.
Mouse macrophage-like cell line. Mouse macrophage-like
cell line, J774A.1, purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA), was plated on 1.5 mm
coverslips pre-coated with fetal calf serum. Cells were
either untreated (control) or activated with 1 µg/ml lipo-
polysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA), either alone or with the addition of 50 nM eplere-
none (LPS+Epl) for 24 hours. Cells were then processed for
immunocytochemistry.

Immunohistochemistry of macrophage
inflammatory markers
Macrophages grown on coverslips were washed twice
with PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min on
ice. Following blocking of non-specific binding sites with
T-TBS containing 5% BSA, coverslips were stained with
the following primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in block-
ing solution: goat anti-mouse C-reactive protein (CRP;
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), rat anti-mouse
IL-6, Armenian hamster anti-mouse MCP-1, rat anti-
mouse CD54 (ICAM1; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA)
and rabbit anti-mouse Nf-Kb p65 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. USA). Following three
washes with blocking solution, the respective fluorescein-
conjugatedsecondaryantibody(JacksonImmunoResearch,
West Grove, PA, USA) was applied. Negative controls
consisted of slides in which only the second antibody was
added. Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Slides were exam-
ined in a Nikon E600 upright microscope with Plan Apo
60×/1.4 oil Dic objective using radiance 2100-confocal
imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and visu-
alized by a Green HeNe (543 nm) laser and red (637 nm)
laser diode. Image Pro Plus® 5.0 software (Media
Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used for intensity
analysis.
LDL and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) uptake by
MPM
LDL was separated from human serum by sequential ultra-
centrifugation.16 oxLDL was prepared by incubation of
100 µg protein/ ml LDL with 5 µmol/l CuSO4
for 2 hours
at 37°C. FITC-conjugated lipoproteins were prepared as
described by Smythe et al.17 MPMs were incubated at
37°C for 3 hours with FITC-conjugated native LDL or ox-
LDL at a final concentration of 25 µg protein/ml. Cellular
uptake of these lipoproteins was determined by fluores-
cence (excitation at 480 nm, emission at 520 nm) using BD
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA).
Gene expression
RNA was extracted from tissue or cells using MasterPureTM
RNA purification kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison,
WI, USA). cDNA was prepared using VersoTM cDNA kit
(Thermo Scientific, Epsom, UK). Primers and probes for
aldosterone synthase, renin and GAPDH were designed by
Primer Design, Southampton, UK. Using ABsolute Blue
QPCR ROX mix (Thermo Scientific), expression was
determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) with Rotor-Gene 6000 amplification detec-
tion system.
Statistics
Results are given as means ± SEM. The Student's t-test was
performed for all statistical analyses. A p<0.05 value is
considered statistically significant.
Results
RAAS and metabolic changes induced by
LSD and LSD+Epl in E0 mice
A LSD, as expected, resulted in RAAS activation. Serum
aldosterone levels were 2.5-fold higher in LSD compared
with ND mice. Treatment with eplerenone further doubled
serum levels of aldosterone in mice fed a LSD (Figure
1A). Adrenal expression of aldosterone synthase was sim-
ilarly enhanced (Figure 1B). Compared to ND, plasma
renin levels were significantly increased, by 20% and
69% for LSD and LSD+Epl mice, respectively (Figure
1C). Expression of renin in the kidneys of LSD mice was
2-fold higher than that measured in ND mice, and
LSD+Epl further enhanced expression of renin by 2.6-
fold (Figure 1D). Both sodium and potassium secretion
were significantly reduced in LSD mice, as expected.
Urine volumes were not significantly different between
ND and LSD mice. Although eplerenone significantly
increased urine volume, the calculated GFR was not sig-
nificantly different between all groups (Table 1). LSD
mice had a significantly reduced systolic blood pressure
(SBP) compared to ND or LSD+Epl mice (91.0±1.9,
99.5±2.0 and 96.3±3.0 mmHg, respectively).
Effects of LSD and LSD+Epl on aortic
atherosclerotic lesions
In this model, where RAAS is activated by a LSD, ath-
erosclerosis is indeed accelerated, with aortic lesion
size 3-fold larger in LSD compared with ND mice.
Eplerenone significantly inhibited development of ath-
erosclerotic lesion size in LSD mice, and the size of the
aortic lesions did not significantly differ from those in
ND mice (Figure 2).
Effects of LSD and LSD+Epl on serum and
MPM atherogenic properties
The anti-atherosclerotic effect of eplerenone could be
mediated by its action on one or more of the major deter-
minants of atherosclerotic plaque development: oxida-
tion, inflammation and cholesterol accumulation. Serum
total cholesterol did not significantly differ between the
groups (data not shown). However, high-density lipopro-
tein (HDL) cholesterol was significantly reduced in LSD
mice, to 50% of that measured in ND mice. Eplerenone
attenuated the reduction in HDL in LSD mice, such that
Raz-Pasteur et al. 231
serum HDL was 28% higher in LSD+Epl mice than LSD
mice (Figure 3A). As HDL is known to protect serum
from oxidation, we measured the oxidation of sera
obtained from these mice. Serum oxidation mirrored the
changes in serum HDL with increases of 77% serum per-
oxidation in LSD mice compared with only 23% in
LSD+Epl mice (Figure 3B). The hallmark of atheroscle-
rotic lesion development is the accumulation of oxidized
LDL in macrophages. Eplerenone significantly reduced
oxidized LDL uptake by peritoneal macrophages as com-
pared to LSD alone (Figure 3C). However, peritoneal
macrophages obtained from all treatment groups did not
significantly differ in their ability to uptake LDL (data not
shown).
Effects of eplerenone on macrophage
inflammation
Eplerenone also had an anti-inflammatory effect as deter-
mined by CRP expression in peritoneal macrophages
obtained from treated mice. LSD alone induced 9-fold
increase in CRP expression in MPMs compared with ND.
Eplerenone treatment in LSD mice reduced CRP in MPM
by 69% compared with LSD alone (Figure 3D). The anti-
inflammatory effect of eplerenone was also observed in
vitro. The mouse macrophage-like cell line J774A.1, acti-
vated by LPS, exhibited a marked increase in expression of
inflammatory markers, which was significantly attenuated
by 50 nM eplerenone (Figure 4). These results suggest that

Discussion
The results of the present study demonstrate that a
sodium-restricted diet activates the RAAS and increases
experimental atherosclerosis in E0 mice. The mineralo-
corticoid blocker eplerenone was shown to counteract the
LSD-induced atherosclerosis through effects on reducing
oxidation, cholesterol accumulation, and inflammation.
High dietary salt intake is known to be correlated with
high BP and an increased risk for CVD.2 However, the pre-
sent study and previous reports6,7 demonstrate that, although
LSD is associated with lower SBP, LSD is paradoxically
linked with an increase in atherosclerosis. Hence, factors
other than BP per se could be related to the development of
atherosclerosis. The results of the present study, showing
that eplerenone reduced LSD-induced atherosclerosis, sug-
gest that aldosterone may mediate the acceleration of ath-
erosclerosis, independent of its effects on BP. This is
supported by a recently published study, showing that the
elevation of plasma aldosterone, but not other `classical'
variables such as blood pressure, is significantly associated
with the progression of atherosclerosis in human.18 The
results of the present study are also in line with those of a
study showing that the effect of eplerenone on the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis in monkeys fed a high-cholesterol
diet is independent of its blood-pressure lowering effects.19
Plasma AngII was previously reported to be signifi-
cantly correlated with aortic atherosclerotic lesion area in
E0 mice fed a LSD.4 ACE inhibition was shown to prevent
the effect of LSD on atherosclerosis,7 while reducing circu-
lating aldosterone levels. In genetically modified mice,
where RAAS is constitutively activated, atherosclerosis is
accelerated to a similar extent in LSD and ND mice.7
Consistent with these reports, our results demonstrate acti-
vation of RAAS and accelerated atherosclerosis in E0 mice
fed a LSD. Our results also demonstrate that blockade of
the RAAS downstream to AngII in the RAAS axis, using
specific mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, prevented the
effects of a LSD on atherosclerosis. Moreover, eplerenone
successfully reduced lesion size in LSD-fed mice, despite
additional increases in renin and aldosterone.
The protective effects of eplerenone shown in the pre-
sent study could contribute to our understanding of LSD-
induced atherosclerosis in a number of different ways.
First, as MR is blocked by eplerenone, and as the rate-lim-
iting enzyme for the formation of RAAS up-stream to
aldosterone, i.e. renin, is further elevated in LSD+Epl mice,
we would have expected that the extent of atherosclerosis
would have been at least similar to that observed in mice

fed LSD alone ifAngII is the mediator of the adverse effects
of a LSD. However, as feeding LSD+Epl resulted in a com-
plete prevention of atherosclerosis, it is less likely that
AngII is the principal mediator of the adverse effects of
LSD in accelerating atherosclerosis. Second, activation of
MR was previously suggested, in in vivo and in vitro stud-
ies, to mediate both aldosterone and AngII-induced gene
transcription related to cardiovascular injury, fibrosis and
inflammation.20,21 Thus, even in the presence of elevated
AngII, the results of the present study may point to a pos-
sible key role for aldosterone and MR activation, rather
than AngII, in the adverse effects of LSD. Third, the `clas-
sical' effects of aldosterone are mediated by the MR, but
aldosterone also has non-MR effects.22 As we have shown
protective effects of eplerenone despite the elevated circu-
lating aldosterone levels in LSD+Epl, it is suggested that
MR-mediated, rather non-MR actions of aldosterone, con-
tribute to the effects of LSD on atherosclerosis.
An excess of aldosterone was previously shown to be
associated with increased inflammatory status23 and
eplerenone attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory
markers.24 In the present study where endogenous aldoster-
one levels are increased by a LSD, CRP expression is sig-
nificantly enhanced in MPMs obtained from LSD-fed mice.
As the expression of this LSD-induced marker of inflamma-
tion was attenuated by eplerenone in these mice, we could
conclude that the anti-inflammatory action of eplerenone is
related to aldosterone antagonism. In this regard, it is inter-
esting to note that deletion of MR from macrophages has

previously been shown to be protective against macrophage
activation and inflammatory response.25,26 However, we
have also shown that eplerenone reduced expression of
inflammatory markers in macrophage-like cells, which were
activated by LPS, independent of aldosterone. This result is
in line with previously reported independent anti-inflamma-
tory effects of another MR blocker, spironolactone, in mon-
onuclear cells activated by LPS in vitro27. It is important to
note that, although the affinity of spironolactone for the
receptor is 10­20-fold higher than that of eplerenone, the
direct anti-inflammatory effects in vitro observed in our
study were achieved at concentrations three orders of mag-
nitude lower than those of spironolactone in previous stud-
ies.28 Given the high selectivity and the low concentration
required for the direct anti-inflammatory effects of
eplerenone in our study, it is suggested that the MR block-
ade is involved. However, the inflammation signaling path-
ways induced by LPS and inhibited by MR antagonism
needs to be elucidated.
In addition to the anti-inflammatory effects of eplerenone
in LSD-fed mice, we have observed other serum and mac-
rophage anti-atherogenic effects, such as reduced oxLDL
uptake by macrophages, which was also observed at nor-
mal RAAS activity in our previous study.14 In agreement
with other studies,6,7,14,29 LSD did not affect serum total
cholesterol levels in E0 mice. However, LSD reduced
serum HDL cholesterol in the present study, and eplerenone
restored HDL levels in LSD-fed mice. The effect of
eplerenone on serum HDL levels, which is considered to be
anti-atherogenic,30 together with its effects on oxidation
and oxidized cholesterol uptake by macrophages, make this
drug efficient in limiting plaque accumulation under condi-
tions of activated RAAS.
In conclusion, eplerenone, a selective MR blocker,
inhibits the acceleration of atherosclerosis associated with
AngII /aldosterone activation in LSD-fed mice. Our study
suggests a key role for MR in mediating the pro-athero-
genic effects of a LSD through regulation of macrophage
inflammation, cholesterol accumulation and oxidation.
