Background: Significant investments and effort are being devoted to health care reform, yet little is
known about the costs of improvements. Practical tools are needed to allow for systematic assessment
of practice expenses. We report here a field trial of a standardized expenditure data collection instru-
ment.
Methods: Combining economic and primary care practice consultation, an expenditure data collec-
tion instrument was created. The instrument underwent observed feasibility testing and was fielded by
10 practice-based research networks in 30 practices conducting 10 different health behavior change
interventions.
Results: Start-up and operating expenses were successfully collected for 87% and 97% of the prac-
tices, respectively. Data collection time and effort were considerable but acceptable. Three elements
were necessary to collect expenditure data: (1) an intervention-specific data collection instrument, (2) a
field guide, and (3) economic oversight and assistance. Fully 90% of networks reported that they
planned to collect expenditure data in the future and study participation increased the likelihood of
their participation in a future expenditure study.
Conclusions: It is feasible to systematically collect intervention-specific expenses in primary care
using formal expenditure methods. However, most practices and researchers lack the knowledge, ex-
pertise, and resources to collect such data independently. Further assistance and education is necessary
to obtain reliable information about the expenses to transform and improve primary care. (J Am Board

Quality improvement, evidence translation, and
practice redesign are necessary to improve the de-
livery of primary care in America. Examples range
from payers incentivizing and mandating e-pre-
scribing or quality performance reporting to calls
for transforming existing practices into patient-
centered medical homes.1­5 These changes have
great potential for benefit, yet the costs and re-
sources required for implementation remain un-
known. Without information about additional ex-
penses associated with redesign, practices cannot
stipulate the financial requirements they bear to
implement systems and services, payers can claim
sufficient payment has already been made, and poli-
cymakers can defer action because judgment about
value is not possible.
As new models of care and revamped reimburse-
ment systems emerge,4,6,7 primary care practices
need to use established financial and economic
methods to understand the expenses associated
with the provision of care. These same methods
will also need to be used to understand comparative
effectiveness. Collecting this information will re-
quire primary care researchers and clinicians to
become more knowledgeable and skillful in collect-
ing expenditure information. Currently there are
few tools designed to collect and analyze expendi-
ture data in primary care settings.

Prescription for Health (P4H), a 6-year, 2-cy-
cle (2003 to 2004 and 2005 to 2007) initiative of
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, funded
22 primary care practice-based research networks
(PBRNs) to develop and test 27 practical health
behavior change interventions.8 ­10 The focus of
the initiative was to develop and test whether
these interventions improved patients' health be-
haviors.11­14 However, the funders recognized
that, for these interventions to be translated out-
side of the research setting and into the real
world, an understanding of expenses incurred by
practices to implement and field the interven-
tions was necessary. As a result, credible practice
expenditure estimates were systematically col-
lected using a standardized instrument by all 10
PBRNs participating in the second cycle of the
initiative. These expenditure results, which have
been previously published, clearly demonstrate
that implementing and fielding health behavior
change interventions is not free for primary care
practices. In fact, practices bore a mean monthly
expense of $58 (range, $1-$354) per patient who
participated in the intervention.15 This article
reports on the development, feasibility, and our
experience using a standardized expenditure data
collection instrument as a model for systemati-
cally gathering expenditure data for implement-
ing practice innovations.
Methods
We conducted a 4-step practical field trial to create
and field an expenditure data collection instrument
combining economic and primary care practice ex-
pertise. The steps included creating a preliminary
version of the instrument, pilot testing and modi-
fying the instrument, fielding the final instrument
in 30 practices from 10 PBRNs that were conduct-
ing different health behavior change interventions,
and surveying the PBRNs after intervention to
evaluate their experiences with the collection of
expenditure data.
Instrument Development
An expenditure steering committee, with exper-
tise in economics, primary care, and the P4H
initiative, was assembled to develop a common
and generalizable method to assess expenditures
that would allow for aggregation and assessment
of information across the 10 funded projects.
The steering committee consisted of an econo-
mist, the primary care researchers conducting the
P4H studies (PBRN members), and members of
the P4H National Program Office. Limited re-
sources were available to fund the collection and
analysis of expenditure data ($5,000 per network)
so a simple, generalizable, and actionable process
was required.
The overarching research question guiding the
steering committee was, "What are the incremental
in-practice expenses attributable to the P4H inter-
ventions?" Guided by this central question and
after consideration of alternative standard eco-
nomic and financial methods (cost minimization
analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost utility
analysis, cost benefit analysis), the committee de-
termined that the most appropriate methodology
was an expenditure analysis.16 The committee did
not opt to use a more simple costing method; they
chose instead a formal expenditure analysis ap-
proach to generate more valid, reproducible, and
generalizable findings. Similarly, the committee
decided not to use modeling, forecasting, or esti-
mations; they chose instead to conduct a prospec-
tive observational evaluation of actual practice ex-
penses. The perspective adopted (ie, who bore the
expense) included only practice expenses and not
researcher, community, or patient expenses. Inter-
vention development expenses were excluded, mak-
ing the assumption that once these interventions
were developed practices would only need to incur
expenses to tailor and implement the existing in-
tervention to their location. We also elected to not
assess opportunity costs.
Next the committee combined formal ex-
penditure methods with the language and needs of
primary care to create a standardized expenditure
data collection instrument.16­19 The instrument
consists of one figure (a patient flow diagram), 3
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) tables
("Start-Up Expenses," "Staff Salaries," and "Oper-
ating Expenses"), and a field guide. The instrument
includes an example of a patient flow diagram with
instructions in the field guide about how to create
a customized diagram for an individual interven-
tion and use it to organize data collection in the 3
tables. The patient flow diagram is used to record
the number of patients that complete each inter-
vention step. From the diagram, the number of
patient participants is transferred to the operating

expense table to calculate recurrent expenses (ie,
patient care activities); additionally, information
about nonrecurrent expenditures on capital assets
and overhead expenditures are recorded. Patient
flow, operating expenses, nonrecurrent expenses,
and overhead expenses are collected at baseline
(before starting the intervention) and at 2 steady-
state time periods after intervention. By subtracting
each steady state expense from baseline expenses
and averaging the differences, the average incre-
mental intervention expense may be calculated.
The field guide defines economic terms, clarifies
the steps needed to collect the expenditure data,
and describes how to categorize expenses for ap-
propriate incremental expenditure calculations. An
example of a completed intervention-specific pa-
tient flow diagram and operating expense table are
provided in Figures 1 and 2. An example of the
instrument and a field guide, describing how to use
the instrument in detail, are available online.20
Pilot Testing
The preliminary instrument was piloted in 6
practices that had previously implemented the
same health behavior change intervention during
the first cycle of P4H (a website with patient
resources).21,22 Initially, one office manager was
asked to complete the instrument while being
observed and timed (phase 1). After refining the
instrument based on phase 1 findings, all 6 of the
practice's office managers were asked to com-
plete the instrument (phase 2). Their responses
were compared with the practices' financial
records for accuracy and they were surveyed
about the process; this information was used to
finalize the instrument for fielding during the
second cycle of P4H.
Instrument Fielding and Assessment
Ten PBRNs were funded during the second round
of P4H. Each PBRN designed and evaluated a
different health behavior change intervention in a
total of 75 practices across the nation.23 The prac-
tices included private practices and community
health centers, large (10 physicians) and small
practices in rural, urban, and suburban locations.
The interventions included health information
technology interventions, modified or new staff
roles, and partnerships with existing community
resources.8,11­14 The 10 funded PBRNs were asked

of the participating Prescription for Health practices. The expenditure steering committee and the practice-based
research networks created the flow diagram in Microsoft Excel. Each practice-based research network then asked
3 representative participating practices to complete the diagram. Practices entered the number of patients
completing each intervention step at baseline and during 2, 1-month steady-state periods of the intervention. Data
in Figure 1 is for one 1-month steady-state period. The main purpose of this diagram was to organize and frame
the data collection for baseline and operating expense figures (Figure 2). BMI, body mass index.

to select 3 representative practices and prospec-
tively assist the practices in collecting expenditure
data using the instrument while concurrently im-
plementing and evaluating the intervention's effect
on patient health behaviors. With the assistance of
the PBRN, each practice determined the specific
data sources necessary to complete the expenditure
instrument and collected the data. Either the prac-
tice or the PBRN could enter the data into the
expenditure instrument. Throughout data collec-
tion, the expenditure steering committee was avail-
able to clarify the instrument and the economic
methods for the PBRNs and practices. In addition,
the committee reviewed all completed instruments
with the PBRNs to ensure accuracy and assist in
fixing any errors. Data were collected for 1 month
at baseline before fielding the intervention, during
the entire start-up period as practices prepared to
field the intervention, and during 2 separate
1-month intervals during steady states of interven-
tion delivery. After expenditure data collection
were complete, all PBRNs completed a brief survey
about the process of collecting expenditure data
using the standardized instrument.
Results
Pilot Testing
During the first phase of pilot testing, one office
manager was provided a generic flow diagram and a
generic set of tables that included the entire range
of potential expenses. The nonspecific flow dia-
gram and extraneous cells in the comprehensive
tables created substantial confusion and resulted in
the office manager only being able to complete the
instrument with detailed guidance. For the second
phase of pilot testing, the instrument was modified
to include only intervention-specific steps and ex-
penses in the flow diagram and tables. Office man-
agers were able to complete the instrument without
direction from the steering committee and re-
ported a mean of 93 minutes needed to assemble
the expenditure data and complete the instrument.
The expenditure data recorded by the office man-
Figure 2. Completed operating expense table. This is a completed intervention-specific operating expense table.
Similarly, the structure of this table was created by the expenditure steering committee and the practice-based
research networks. Practices then used the flow diagram (Figure 1) to complete the number of patients eligible for
and completing each intervention activity in section A of this table. Practices used additional data sources to
complete the remaining cells in sections A, B, and C. Data shown in here is for same 1-month steady-state period
used in Figure 1. As with Figure 1, practices would complete this table for a baseline period and for 2, 1-month
steady-state periods. By subtracting expenses for each 1-month steady-state period (1 month shown in this table)
from the baseline expenses (not shown) and averaging the values, the economist could calculate the incremental
expenses for each practice's intervention. BMI, body mass index; FTE, full time equivalent; P4H, Prescription for Health.

agers using the instrument were consistent with
practice financial records and the 6 office managers
independently recorded similar types and values for
expenses, with 3 exceptions: each office separately
reported costs shared across the offices, resulting in
duplicate reporting; one office did not report staff
known to be involved in delivering the interven-
tion; and one office reported a 2- to 5-fold greater
length of time for a patient to go through specific
intervention delivery steps than the other practices.
In response, the steering committee decided that
the economist would review all data, validate or
correct data outliers with each PBRN, and consol-
idate duplicate entries of shared expenses.
Instrument Fielding
The expenditure steering committee distributed a
customized expenditure data collection instrument
and field guide to each of the 10 PBRNs. All
PBRNs were asked to review these documents and
report any discrepancies and further customization
that was necessary. The steering committee assisted
PBRNS that required changes to their instruments
or field guides, at times developing several versions
of these documents until the PBRNs deemed them
accurately representative of their interventions. An
example of a completed patient flow diagram and
steady state expenditure table with a description of
how the instrument was used is provided in Figures
1 and 2. Although PBRN input was essential to the
creation of the customized instruments, significant
assistance was required from the steering commit-
tee to clarify economic terms, create a flow diagram
and expenditure list that captured all potential ex-
penses and intervention steps (all networks initially
neglected some potential expenses and intervention
steps), and categorize expenses for appropriate eco-
nomic analysis (networks had difficulty differenti-
ating recurrent expenses, overhead, and capital as-
sets).
Once the instrument was customized, the
PBRNs asked the practices to collect the specific
data. At this stage, all practices required their
PBRNs assistance with data collection. PBRNs
needed to clarify the economic terms and prompt
practices to identify all potential expenses, similar
to the prompting that the PBRNs needed from the
expenditure committee. Specific practice expendi-
ture data sources tended to vary based on the in-
tervention and included office managers, clinicians,
financial staff, financial records, electronic medical
records, personnel activity logs, and direct obser-
vation (see Table 1). Although all practices were
able to provide expenditure information, most
PBRNs provided assistance to record the data in
the expenditure data collection instrument and the
economist was needed to calculate the overall ex-
penditures (see Table 1).
Ultimately, all 10 PBRNs were able to field the
expenditure instrument and collect expenditure
data. One PBRN was able to collect data from only
2 of the requested 3 practices and one was unable to
collect start-up expenses, both because of work
pressures unrelated to the study that these partici-
pating practices were experiencing at the time of
data collection (eg, one practice was adopting a new
electronic medical record). Overall, start-up and
operating expenses were successfully collected for
26 (87%) and 29 (97%) of the 30 practices, respec-
tively.
PBRN Survey Responses
The majority of PBRNs reported that the time and
effort required for data collection was acceptable
(with 1 being "very acceptable" and 5 being "ac-

ceptable"; 4 was a "neutral" response; see Table 2).
Several PBRNs experienced moderate difficulties
customizing their expenditure tables and figures to
their intervention (6 had a "neutral" response and 4
responded it was "difficult"). The PBRNs consid-
ered that the expertise provided by the expenditure
steering committee was a necessary resource (8
reported it was "very important" and 2 reported it
was "important"). Overall, 90% of the PBRNs re-
ported that they planned to collect expenditure
data in the future and that their participation in the
P4H expenditure study increased the likelihood
that they would participate in a future expenditure
study.
Discussion
More research is necessary to estimate the cost of
primary care and its value. The P4H expenditure
study confirmed that it is possible to systematically
measure primary care expenses, and the average
reported P4H intervention practice expense--$58
per participant--was substantially higher than cur-
rent reimbursements.15 Most PBRNs and practices
were able to collect credible expenditure data while
creating, fielding, and assessing novel health behav-
ior change interventions. The time and effort were
generally considered acceptable and the experience
appreciably increased their likelihood of collecting
expenditure data in the future.
However, both PBRNs and practices had dif-
ficulties with the formal expenditure methodol-
ogy, frequently reverting to simple cost analyses,
collecting absolute intervention costs rather than
incremental expenses, and underestimating or
neglecting real expenses. Practices frequently
knew their general costs and revenue, but had
trouble attributing specific resources to specific
interventions. The nature of primary care makes
such attributions difficult. Intervention expenses
were often intermingled with other noninterven-
tion-related office and clinical activities. Com-
monly, staff time for intervention activities was
brief, lasting only several minutes, but was often
repeated by many staff members many times per
day. These expenses were not only difficult to
measure, but were often overlooked. However,
collectively these expenses represented signifi-
cant resource requirements for practices.
Practices and PBRNs both had difficulties as-
signing the correct financial category to expen-
ditures. Differentiating whether an expense was a
development versus start-up expense or an inter-
vention delivery versus research study expense
was a challenge. The PBRNs had extensive re-
search and data collection experience but had
minimal experience with collecting expenditure
data. The practices knew about their clinical ac-
tivities and their expenses, but not about system-
atic data collection and expenditure methods.
However, all these challenges were overcome by
creating an expenditure guide to define economic
terms and describe incremental data collection
methods, providing a data collection instrument
to standardize data collection, using the field
experience of the PBRNs to coordinate and over-
see data collection, and establishing a steering
committee to provide external expertise and sup-
port.
The observed challenges with collecting ex-
penses in primary care are not unexpected. Sys-
tematic collection of intervention expenses is not
part of existing primary care research or practice
culture. In the current relative-value scale reim-
bursement model, even if a practice understands
their expenses they have little power to modify
their fees for more appropriate reimbursement.24
Likewise, although lack of reimbursement is a
frequent barrier to the ultimate dissemination of
interventions created by primary care research-
ers, researchers are more focused on evaluating
whether interventions are effective rather than

generating the expenditure data necessary for
dissemination.25
The practice expenditures resulting from this
study demonstrate a clear mismatch between actual
primary care expenses and current reimbursements,
demonstrating why it is necessary to assess what
practice interventions really cost, particularly for
health behavior change interventions.15 Medicare
currently only reimburses for smoking cessation
counseling and dietary counseling (but only for
diabetics) whereas many commercial insurers do
not even provide this insufficient coverage.26 In
2006, Medicare reimbursed $13 to $25 for smoking
cessation counseling.27 However, the average P4H
intervention expense was $58 per patient partici-
pant.15 Modeling techniques are commonly used to
determine practice costs and determine reimburse-
ment rates, but models are frequently inconsistent
with real practice expenses. For example, the Fu-
ture of Family Medicine's financial task force re-
ported that group visits, team-based care, and clin-
ical practice guideline software could increase a
5-physician practice's annual revenue by $5,664 to
$15,411.6 Conversely, as we reported previously,
similar P4H interventions cost practices $2 to $63
per patient participant.15
In this article, we described experiences of
PBRNs and practices with collecting expenditure
data using expenditure methods. These experiences
lead us to several suggestions to facilitate the col-
lection of primary care expenditures:
1. Funders should ask for and support expendi-
ture data collection as part of the outcomes
assessment of interventions, similar to what
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation did
with P4H.
2. PBRN researchers, who have both primary care
practice and data collection expertise, can
serve as a resource for collecting expenditures,
both in educating practices and catalyzing
change through ongoing work.
3. A standardized data collection instrument cus-
tomized to specific interventions--such as the
one we used in P4H--can systematize data
collection, allowing for the collection of ex-
penditures that are consistent, valid, and gen-
eralizable.
4. External economic expertise and oversight is
necessary to assist with the collection and
analysis of expenditure data.
5. Payers need to incentivize collection of expen-
diture data and use this information to ensure
appropriate practice reimbursement.
This article reports on a process and the ex-
periences of collecting expenditure data in pri-
mary care practices for health behavior change
interventions. Fully, 30 practices from 10 PBRNs
from across the nation participated in the study,
providing robust and generalizable findings
about the experience. An expenditure data col-
lection instrument was used to standardize data
collection, which can serve as the groundwork for
the development of future expenditure data col-
lection instruments. In addition, the instrument
could be used to collect additional expenses that
we chose not to collect (eg, intervention devel-
opment, opportunity costs, etc) or expense per-
spectives that we did not consider (eg, patient,
community programs, payer, etc).
Although the reported findings have relevance
to intervention dissemination and practice rede-
sign, our study does have several important limita-
tions. We conducted a prospective observational
study with no comparison group. The PBRNs se-
lected representative practices for participation and
probably selected practices that they presumed
would be successful with expenditure data collec-
tion. Despite the participation of such practices and
the creation of the expenditure data collection in-
strument, we found that both practices and PBRNs
had difficulties with using expenditure methods.
Although this seems like a limitation, meaning that
the average primary care practice could not take
our instrument and field it in practice without as-
sistance, this is a key finding that highlights the
need for enhanced knowledge and expertise in pri-
mary care to generate expenditure data in the fu-
ture.
Conclusion
Economic and financial research can add value in
primary care and will be a necessary component of
future work involving comparative effectiveness re-
search, translation of evidence, and creation of
medical homes. Although more work is necessary
to develop and refine data collection tools and pri-
mary care practices and researchers need training
and experience with systematically collecting ex-
penses, the P4H experience suggests that collecting
expenditures is feasible.
