Special Collection--Student Diversity
Diamonds are my business. However, my mine is long aban-
doned and well worn. Long gone are the fancy machines,
sparkling tools, and multitude of workers who once labored
to discover the sparkling gems that lie beneath. Now, all that
is left are myself and the hard to find diamonds--the ones
that take excruciating effort to locate, yet are still highly
valuable once they are finally discovered and polished. My
tools are limited. Fancy equipment and influx of supplies are
a distant memory; therefore, I rely on ingenuity and, perhaps
most importantly, my mind to reveal the treasures that were
left behind in the rapidity and oversight of my predecessors.
Of course, the diamonds I am referring to are carbon based,
but they are not the gems that adorn the fingers and necks of
other people--they are people; students to be exact. However,
these students, much like the remnants left behind in an
abandoned mine, struggle to be recognized for both their
beauty and potential for success. As their teacher, I often feel
like the lone miner who has unlimited access to their aban-
doned prize, and although it can be a difficult challenge to
uncover and polish the gems that are locked deep within the
earth, the feeling of zeal and passion when one is discovered
is second to none.
In a world of equitable education for all, it is surprising
that these students have been relegated to near abandonment.
While their dominant culture or high aptitude peers have been
transitioned into college bound tracks and advanced courses,
these students have simply slipped into despair due to a quag-
mire of issues: learning disabilities, low-socioeconomic sta-
tus, broken homes, behavioral struggles, constant moving
between schools, and interactions with teachers who are
either unprepared to meet their individual needs or frustrated
with their constant need for remediation, both academically
and affectively. Consequently, our system's most struggling
students are often passed along without the requisite skills
needed to succeed in life or are simply cast off just like the
diamonds in the mine whose cost to extract outweighs their
perceived value in the open market. However, the fact that
their inherent value has not been initially recognized is not
always cause for alarm because there are prospectors among
us who are always on the hunt to discover the jewel that still
lies within each and every one of these students: the potential
to become empowered members of society through access
and support within our educational system.
As a teacher within fragile populations, I have noticed
that many of my students lack the motivation to complete
assignments or display a lack of confidence in their academic
abilities. However, what is most interesting to me is that my
students are far more capable than they perceive themselves
to be. When probed about the disconnect between their
potential and their actual performance, many of my students
explain that they have been told in the past that they are sub-
par or have been made to feel like failures due to constant
comparison with other students. Consequently, their motiva-
tion to complete work wanes because they feel inadequate
and their perspective on their abilities is skewed due to a lack
of feedback or positive attention. This, combined with the
general apathy and lack of motivation often seen among high

The Effects of Student Reflection on
Academic Performance and Motivation
Derek Cavilla1,2
Abstract
Building upon reflection as a tool for enhanced metacognition, the researcher postulated that a positive correlation would
exist between application of a reflection instrument and students' level of academic performance and motivation in an urban
high school English class. A statistically insignificant correlation was found between either construct; however, qualitative
analysis provides implications for teachers on the power of student reflection. Foremost, reflective activities do not appear
to detract from academic performance nor have a negative correlation with student motivation. Furthermore, reflective
activities in the short term appear to affect students on an affective level rather than a cognitive level.

school students who are near graduation, is highly problem-
atic for both the student and the teacher because precious
learning time and opportunities are being lost at a critical
stage in life--a time when youth are making the transition to
adulthood and must be prepared to enter either an institution
of higher learning, the military, or the workforce.
This conundrum is the basis for my study. In wondering
how I could improve overall student motivation and self-
concept, I honed in on the idea of reflection as a tool not only
to enhance students' affective psyche, but their academic
performance as well. As a passionate and caring teacher, I
take extra time to provide my students with feedback on all
their assignments and am sure to point out the positive
aspects of their work and efforts in my class. This is an
anomaly for many of my students and, at first, they are often
unsure if the grades and feedback they are receiving are hon-
est and accurate. Over time, they begin to realize that they
have significant talent and skills; however, until this realiza-
tion is internalized and reinforced on an intrapersonal level,
there is a possibility for relapse and regression. Therefore, it
is my hope that the introduction of a mandatory, structured
reflection as part of assignments in my class will yield posi-
tive results in the form of less missing assignments and
improved performance on academic tasks. Asking students
to examine their own efforts on assignments as well as
requiring them to formally state their rationale for complet-
ing or choosing not to complete activities through reflection
will provide them with the personal insight and intrapersonal
cognition that is required for success not only in the educa-
tional arena, but in professional and higher education set-
tings as well.
A significant amount of research and resources regarding
reflection are focused on teachers, not students, and have
more prevalence either in contexts outside of education, such
as in Mountford and Rogers's (1996) study on the use of
reflection in nursing, or in institutions of higher education,
such as Yost, Sentner, and Forlenza-Bailey's (2000) notion of
reflection as the primary component of an effective teacher,
rather than in primary or secondary school settings. In addi-
tion, while reflection could be seen as a type of self-evalua-
tion, my action research is not focused on students' actual
ability to evaluate their own work. Rather, students are asked
to reflect on their perceived effort and to gauge their overall
performance of the task at hand, a concept discussed and
clarified by Kritt (1993) as metacognition or thinking about
one's own thinking. While metacognition is a construct too
large to review in the context of this study, research indicates
that students with higher metacognitive ability are often
more successful than those who lack this skill (Sperling,
Richmond, Ramsay, & Klapp, 2012). Therefore, the purpose
of this study is not to focus on the benefit of teacher reflec-
tion or the use of reflection as self-evaluation, but rather on
reflection as a tool for improved student metacognitive prac-
tices and academic performance as previously investigated
with success by Ash, Clayton, and Atkinson (2005); Lew and
Schmidt (2011); and--as specifically examined for under-
served high school populations such as the context for this
study--Cleary, Platten, and Nelson (2008). This focus cul-
minates in the research question for this study:
Research Question 1: To what extent does student reflec-
tion correlate with academic achievement and motivation
to complete assignments for underserved students in 11th-
and 12th-grade English?
Review of Literature
The goal of this study is to determine if a correlation exists
between student self-reflection and academic performance
and motivation. This review of literature will serve to
inform the following aspects of my research: how reflec-
tion is defined, how reflection has evolved over time,
what previous research has discovered regarding any
potential connections between student self-reflection and
academic performance and motivation, as well as the
implications for teachers who may or may not currently be
utilizing reflective exercises in their own classrooms. As
discussed by Yancey (1998), "[i]f we don't ask our stu-
dents to [reflect on] their own work--a process based on
internal factors and criteria--they are likely to [remain]
dependent on external rewards, now knowing where to
begin to consider their own performance" (p. 14).
Moreover, students who are explicitly taught metacogni-
tive activities, such as written self-reflection, tend to be
more highly engaged in their school work as well as main-
tain higher levels of academic proficiency (McCormick,
Dimmitt, & Sullivan, 2013).
While reflection could be seen as a type of self-evalua-
tion, my research was not focused on students' actual ability
to evaluate their own work. Rather, they were asked to reflect
on their perceived effort and to gauge their overall perfor-
mance of the task at hand. Therefore, the articles presented
below do not involve the concept of reflection as self-evalu-
ation, but rather reflection as a tool for improved metacogni-
tive practices to effectively enhance overall academic
motivation and performance. The following review of litera-
ture will guide the reader through (a) the history and ratio-
nale for integration of reflective thinking, (b) definitions and
concepts of student self-reflection as they relate to education,
(c) the potential benefits of integrating reflective activities
into the classroom, (d) specific studies that support these
benefits, and (e) the implications for teachers to create action
to make reflection a part of their day-to-day classroom rou-
tines. Therefore, to provide a holistic rationale and review,
literature has been included from the educational, profes-
sional, and international arenas. For purposes of this study, as
well as the context for this review of literature, the definition
of reflection provided by Webb and Scoular (2011) will be
utilized:

The History and Rationale for Integration of
Reflective Thinking
The foundations of reflection as a tool for learning began not
within the walls of a primary or secondary classroom, but
outside of the realm of education altogether. For example,
Mountford and Rogers (1996) conducted research on the use
of individual and group reflection as a tool for effective
learning for nurses and claim,
formal reflection was seen as a learning strategy to influence
positively students' educational outcomes and professional
practice via six key factors[:] . . . academic self concept, . . . task
awareness . . . views of knowledge, . . . the influence of
knowledge on behavior, . . . writing as a learning activity, and . .
. generating knowledge by reflecting in and on assessment with
discussion. (p. 1127)
While this study focused on a field outside of education, the
idea of academic self-concept and task awareness are of par-
ticular interest to education. The study relays that "when
someone's self-concept matches what they really think, feel
and do, they are able to realize their full potential" (Rogers in
Mountford and Rogers, 1996, p. 1128). Regarding the idea of
task analysis, the researchers point to Dewey (1933) who
asserted,
being responsible and taking control of one's own education and
practice as essential attributes for success. Task awareness is just
as much a part of education as it is a part of practice. Students
who are active in constructing meaning from their educational
tasks . . . are more successful, especially in the long term.
(Mountford & Rogers, 1996, p. 1129)
Given this close connection to the idea of reflection in educa-
tion, it is no surprise that later research focused on the idea of
teacher preparation programs working to develop more
reflective educators.
The Journal of Teacher Education (Yost et al., 2000)
refers back to Dewey, who felt the most important quality of
a teacher was critical reflection. The authors relay that
a reflective/analytic teacher is one who makes teaching decisions
on the basis of conscious awareness and careful consideration of
the assumptions on which the decision are based[.]. . . The end
result of critical reflection for the individual is cognitive change.
(Yost et al., 2000, p. 41)
This focus on the importance of reflection for the educator is
what spurned so many colleges of education, perhaps includ-
ing our own, to infuse high levels of reflective thinking and
practice within the pedagogy of the teachers that they are
training. Yost et al. (2000) wrote, "we believe that teacher
education programs must designate critical reflection as a
primary mission and interweave reflection throughout the
teacher education curriculum" (p. 41). Consequently, it is
logical to assert that the more reflective the teacher, the more
teachers will imbue reflective thinking within the curriculum
for their students, which is a primary focus of my own study.
Despite the focus on developing a reflective teacher and the
lack of research on student-centered reflection, one area of
focus that prior research felt would benefit from infusion of
reflection was the area of service learning.
Ogden and Claus (1997) discussed the "burgeoning ser-
vice learning movement" of the 1990s and relay the impor-
tance of reflection among student participants to avert
relegating service learning projects to a mere "superficial
addition" to the school curriculum (p. 72). The authors relay,
the experiential education and service learning literature makes
clear that reflection is the central way in which we process
experience into learning. Reflection contributes to understanding
and generalization, and it becomes the cornerstone to developing
a more thoughtful and intentional pursuit of future action.
(Ogden & Claus, 1997, p. 72)
This concept of processing experience into meaningful learn-
ing and understanding is not isolated to service learning; in
fact, it is the basic tenet for why reflection ultimately devel-
oped into a core principle for preservice teachers as well as
deemed beneficial for students across all subjects of the cur-
riculum. Therefore, before we are able to examine the pro-
spective benefits of the induction of reflective thinking into
the curriculum, or delve into actual studies surrounding this
topic, it is essential to canvass the rationale for its develop-
ment and integration in the first place.
Definitions and Concepts of Student Self-
Reflection as They Relate to Education
Yancey (1998) relayed that many teachers see reflection
activities as student self-evaluation and that many students
are reticent to participate in self-assessment because they
"see that kind of judgment as belonging to the teacher" (p.
13). However, the same study is clear to assert that to transi-
tion students from external to intrinsic motivation to suc-
ceed, reflection must be integrated and embraced within the
classroom. Therefore, while reflection does not need to take
the place of a teacher's assessment, it can be infused as part
of an activity to enhance student performance because, if stu-
dents are "makers of meaning," their own thoughts and inter-
pretation of their work and its overall impact "have to be part
of the mix" (Yancey, 1998, p. 17). All in all, the most com-
pelling issue related to prior research in the use of reflective
4 SAGE Open
thinking is its inherent power to enhance outcomes--particu-
larly in combination or support of metacognition and/or criti-
cal thinking (Ford & Yore, 2012). From professional fields
outside of education, to teachers, to students, the power of
reflection is evident; however, its integration into the curric-
ulum must be intentional and well planned to have maximum
effect.
This mirrors the position taken by Kritt (1993) who
relayed, "by about fifth grade children begin to have meta-
cognitive ability sufficient to realize when they are not
understanding something. . . . [T]hey could use this knowl-
edge to monitor their own behavior" (p. 44). This connection
to learning theory and affective development is crucial and
implies that reflection could be an appropriate self-monitor-
ing tool in both primary and secondary grades. This infusion
of self-discipline and ability to think about the approach used
to complete an academic task is critical to achievement and
motivation; Kritt (1993) concluded that
developing a concept of oneself as a thinking person requires
opportunities to engage the range of one's abilities and guidance
in recognizing one's strengths and weaknesses, as well as
assistance in figuring out how to play to one's strengths and
minimize weaknesses. (p. 45)
However, the rationale for development and direct instruc-
tion of reflective practices is not limited in scope to just the
United States.
Russian educational theorists have developed a method
for direct instruction of reflection, dubbed Learning Activity,
for elementary school students. As discussed by Zuckerman
(2004), "when the elementary school curriculum does not
foster reflective development, other habits of intellectual
work will be cultivated that later limit students motivation
for and access to self-learning" (p. 10). Given this tenet, the
author presents the Russian viewpoint of reflection, which
mirrors what many professional educators may already be
doing in their classroom, albeit implicitly. Zuckerman (2004)
relayed that concepts such as considering the goals and
means of one's own actions and thoughts as well as the will-
ingness and consideration to take on the views of others are
critical to effective educational growth and learning, going
as far as to say that direct instruction of reflective thinking
can stretch students'zone of proximal development as postu-
lated by Vygotsky. This is a pivotal idea considering that, the
wider a student's zone of proximal development, the greater
the amount of learning that can take place independently
once it has been properly scaffolded by the teacher.
Asimilar consensus was determined by English and Swedish
researchers who concluded that student reflection served to
enhance "learning as understanding `reality'" and ultimately
resulting in students' abilities to "see learning as personally
meaningful . . . [and] describe . . . transformation[s] in percep-
tions of the world before and after learning" (Bednar & Eglin,
2007, p. 46). This analysis builds upon the aforementioned
Russian study and discusses the concept of secondary and post-
secondary students using reflection to develop double-loop
learning. In this framework, students who have mastered reflec-
tive thinking practices move from "`passing the unit,'to create a
more productive learning spiral in which they gain transferable
learning skills" (Bednar & Eglin, 2007, p. 53). These interna-
tional comparisons serve to illustrate the cross-cultural and
humanitarian basis for the benefits of reflection activities in
both primary and secondary settings.
The Potential Benefits of Integrating Reflective
Activities Into the Classroom
Rusche and Jason (2011) asserted,
critical self-reflection not only improves students' critical
thinking skills but also helps students develop self-knowledge. .
. . [It] compels students to interrogate their beliefs and
perspectives on reality by acknowledging how they influence,
and are influenced by, their social realities. (pp. 339-340)
This sheds light not only on the power of reflection as an
academic learning tool, but on the transformative power of
its ability to fundamentally change the way students think
and perceive their effort, motivation, and ability to complete
novel and familiar tasks. In addition to supporting students'
abilities to think about their thinking, the basic principle of
metacognition, reflection also allows students affective out-
lets that can reduce stress and frustration toward the curricu-
lum. As discussed by Rusche and Jason (2011), "giving
students an opportunity to `write it out'not only can alleviate
some frustration but can significantly deepen their grasp on
the material, even when they do not like it or agree with it"
(p. 346). Colley, Bilics, and Lerch (2012) took a similarly
positive outlook with regard to the power and importance of
metacognitive thinking as developed by reflection; they
relay, "lifelong learning takes place through reflection. That
is, learning begins with metacognition, knowing one's own
thoughts and reflection, which allows the individual to iden-
tify factors that influence one's own thinking" (p. 1). As
teachers, we are often tasked with designing or delivering a
mere section of the overall curriculum--a grade in primary
school or simply a year of a single subject in secondary
school. However, the underlying hope is that our impact
spans well beyond the 180 days that students spend in our
charge. Rather, if students are truly supported through effec-
tive instruction as well as empowered for the development of
enhanced affective and metacognitive growth, the effect is
much longer lasting--perhaps for a student's entire lifetime
(McCormick et al., 2013). As evidenced in the literature,
there is a clear rationale for the integration of reflection in the
classroom, with Colley et al. (2012) calling it a "key peda-
gogical strategy . . . [that] develop[s] a realistic sense of effi-
cacy and motivation" (pp. 12-13); however, it is also integral
to examine the specific benefits of its implementation.
Cavilla 5
Student reflection was identified as one of the top six
activities to promote student achievement in Maurice Elias's
(2010) article titled, "School Climate That Promotes Student
Voice." In his article, the author attests that "students should
have chances to set some of their own goals, monitor their
own progress, have choices in how they show evidence of
what they've learned, and share their learning with others"
(Elias, 2010, p. 24). This approach seems effective because it
helps to create a culture of intrinsic motivation to succeed as
well as promotes students' approaches to completing assign-
ments for the sake of growth and learning rather than simply
to receive a grade. By encouraging students to express their
thoughts and ideas about their performance on academic
tasks, we are not only allowing them to analyze their own
learning, but are teaching them a skill that reaches far beyond
the classroom and into the rest of their adult lives in both
professional and social interactions. As summarized by the
author of this study, "lasting learning is the results of acts of
co-creation in caring contexts, and that is what the pedagogy
of student voice provides" (Elias, 2010, p. 22).
A comparable framework was examined by Harford
(2008) who passionately relayed, "routine reflection exer-
cises can result in the most exciting and rewarding moments
in the classroom . . . [because] reflection reinforces the stu-
dents' sense of competence and accomplishment while
simultaneously helping them recognize their areas of weak-
ness" (pp. 61-62). Again, this sentiment is imperative when
discussing the potential impact of reflection as a tool to sup-
port student growth because learning is more than memoriz-
ing content or moving through the curriculum--It is about
helping students to develop the confidence to attempt con-
cepts that may be foreign to them, to persevere in the face of
adversity, and to use failure or impasse to deepen the desire
to find new approaches to solving problems. When these
components are infused with the content of the curriculum,
we are no longer moving through learning, we are experienc-
ing intellectual and emotional evolution. In her closing,
Harford attests, "engaging in an authentic process of reflec-
tion . . . is one of the best ways to ensure buy-in from stu-
dents across the academic spectrum" (p. 65). This concept of
buy-in is critical, especially in today's assessment-driven
culture where students may feel the effects of an unintention-
ally fractured curriculum or propensity to learn simply for
the sake of passing state-mandated tests. Consequently, once
the culture of reflection is successfully integrated into the
classroom or school setting, its effects have shown to be
potent--even in an assessment-driven educational culture.
Prior Studies That Support the Benefits of
Reflection
Ash et al. (2005) discussed how reflective activities must be
intentionally linked to assessment, which is the approach
used in my study. To receive a summative evaluation of their
work, my students will have completed and attached a reflec-
tion activity to their assignment. Ash et al. (2005) relayed
that reflection activities have the potential to improve stu-
dents' overall academic performance as well as allow teach-
ers to "evaluate the quality of thinking" demonstrated by
individual students by "gaining access to their internal
thought processes about the activities" (p. 49). This is an
important component to consider because it implies the pos-
sibility for teachers to unravel the disparity between students'
perceived and actual ability levels through execution of
reflective interventions. Phan (2008) shared a similar out-
look on the value of reflection, but notes that very few stud-
ies have looked at its actual impact in the classroom setting;
her research tested a structural model that included looking
at the classroom environment, achievement goals, and reflec-
tive thinking practices. In this study, it was determined that
the overall ability of reflective thinking in relation to student
achievement relies heavily on the actual classroom environ-
ment that it is being implemented in (Phan, 2008, p. 571).
Although the overall number of studies that analyze and
report findings on the connection between reflection and aca-
demic achievement or motivation are limited, there are a few
that are noteworthy.
A review from the Journal of Advanced Academics sup-
ports the specific rationale for my study and focuses on the
performance of secondary students in an urban setting, which
aligns very well with the situation presented in my research.
The authors state,
[i]mpacting the academic performance of high school students .
. . is important because of the high-stakes nature . . . relative to
their vocational and post-secondary pursuits. . . . Getting
students to become more active, strategic participants in their
learning . . . is an important pathway to academic success.
(Cleary et al., 2008, p. 71)
The authors relay that there is no single intervention that can
rectify the poor academic performance seen among today's
urban, high school students; however, students in their study
did show marked improvement on academic tasks after
exposure to a well-structured intervention program involving
student reflection. This is promising and posits that future
research studies, such as the one presented herein, will allow
for greater generalization of findings for urban or high school
students in general. Lew and Schmidt (2011) concluded that
student reflection through the use of journals resulted in stu-
dents examining both the process and content of their learn-
ing and showed a weak to moderate correlation with
improved academic performance. Their findings suggest that
students' ability to accurately reflect on their work improves
over time, but does not significantly affect their overall per-
formance on work in the classroom (Lew & Schmidt, 2011,
p. 540). In addition, the authors relay that, in their experi-
ence, self-reflection skills are not easily taught and that the
question of whether or not effective student reflection affects
6 SAGE Open
overall performance either positively or negatively is still up
for debate. However, rather than abandon the concept of
reflection as a tool for enhanced student performance, the
authors of this study suggest that further research is needed
as well as point out that student reflection may improve stu-
dent learning in ways that are not measureable by academic
achievement (Lew & Schmidt, 2011, p. 540). However,
while these studies clearly indicate the power of reflection as
a tool for enhanced academic performance, further studies
show the relevance for improved metacognition and
enhanced motivation to succeed academically by allowing
students to recognize and ponder areas of excellence as well
as needed improvement (McCormick et al., 2013; Sperling
et al., 2012).
Desautel (2009) conducted a study on the effects of reflec-
tion in an urban elementary school, very similar to the eth-
nography of my study, and concluded, "self-reflection serves
the goal of constructing metacognitive knowledge by mak-
ing formerly unconscious, intangible, or reflexive processes
or events explicit" (p. 2001). This concept is integral and
points out not only the power of reflection but also the need
for its meaningful integration into the curriculum. In the cur-
rent age of assessment-driven culture, many students are
forced full of facts, strategies, and procedures, but are often
not allowed time for this content to percolate or culminate
into synthesis of how to transfer it into other arenas.
Therefore, while requiring specific planning and execution
time, reflection can help students transfer knowledge and
understanding from the subconscious to the conscious part of
their psyches. This approach is also supported by Webb and
Scoular (2011) whose study revealed, "reflection time help-
ful for recapping . . . lesson[s] and reinforcing learning. It
helped [students] realize what they were doing wrong and
what they needed to improve" (p. 479). These studies convey
the power of student self-reflection as a learning activity in
relation to improved academic performance, motivation, and
metacognitive thinking, which mirrors the rationale for this
study.
Implications for Teachers
In her article "Practicing the Virtue of Reflection in an
Unfamiliar Context," Birmingham (2003) discussed the
model of reflection known as phronesis. In this theory, first
described by Aristotle in his work Nicomachean Ethics,
reflection is not something a teacher does, not a form of
knowledge or a thought process, not a rule or a principle, but a
moral way of being. The first implication of this model is that
reflection is more than relevant to moral issues; reflection is
essentially moral. (Birmingham, 2003, p. 189)
The study continues to describe the definition of phronesis as
"practical wisdom" and "the virtue of thought that permits
correct reasoning in decisions that involve virtues of
character" (Birmingham, 2003, p. 190). Connecting
Aristotle's concept of phronesis back to Dewey, Birmingham
(2003) relayed the three virtues of character, or attitudes that
he considered essential for reflection: wholeheartedness,
open-mindedness, and responsibility (p. 192). The idea of
reflection as a tool for morality and ethics supports a study
conducted by Sunstein (1998) who implemented reflection
as a way to prelude students'propensity for plagiarism in her
classroom. After asking students to reflect on their actions
and intentions for assignments, the value and importance of
reflection as a tool in the classroom became clear; however,
the author points out that use of reflection must be inten-
tional and meaningful. She writes,
[v]apidreflectionseems,atbest,anexerciseinself-indulgence[.].
. . Careful, detailed reflection upon one's own learning, however,
is not among the "basic skills" taught in schools[,]. . . [b]ut it is
[how] . . . students take stock of learning represented in a given
collection of work at a given moment in time. (Sunstein, 1998,
p. 40)
This call for meaningful reflection is important and relays
that reflective activities must be infused within the curricu-
lum rather than seen as a mandatory add-on or mundane
requirement.
While this may take extra planning to incorporate into the
curriculum, the benefits are paramount because when stu-
dents and teachers analyze outcomes and assessments with
rigorous questions that demand reflection and reflexivity,
everyone involved has the potential to see the true meaning
of the assignment at hand (Sunstein, 1998). However, while
reflective thinking has become an integral part of both the
teacher and his or her student, it is important to delineate the
concept of reflection as support for performance and motiva-
tion versus being used as an actual self-assessment.
Duijnhouwer, Prins, and Stokking (2012) provided a concise
definition of reflection as it relates to this study: "a process
that starts with the identification of a problem and the deci-
sion to seek a solution" (p. 172). Ge and Land in Duijnhouwer
et al. (2012) relayed that "instruction that provides students
with questions to ask themselves during problem-solving has
been shown to enhance performance" (p. 173).
Although existing research on this topic is limited, there
does appear to be a positive correlation with student self-
reflection and academic performance and motivation. For
example, Duijnhouwer et al. (2012) mirrored the anticipated
outcome of this study. By asking students to reflect on their
assignments to personally explore their true intentions and
insight toward their perceived efforts and cognitive growth,
rather than as a manner of simply providing a quantitative
grade or summative evaluation on their own work, it is my
intention to enhance their performance not only academically
but affectively as well--thus translating into a correlation not
only between reflection and performance but also between
reflection and mere motivation to attempt completion of
Cavilla 7
assignments. Nascent research also asserts that the lines
between critical thinking, metacognition, and reflection
should be blurred in an effort to promote cohesion and inter-
dependence among these core, yet historically separated con-
structs, in the classroom (Ford & Yore, 2012).
Method
Site and Participants
The setting for this study is a small high school that was
established 9 years ago and operates in the heart of down-
town Orlando as a public, Orange County charter school.
The school serves only students in the 11th and 12th grades
and provides teaching in all core content areas as well as in
physical education and business. Of the 242 students who
attend the school, 54% are African American, 26% are
Hispanic, 18% are Caucasian, and 2% are Asian. The gender
balance is fairly equal, with 51% of the student body being
female and 49% male; the institution is a Title One school
and nearly all the student population comes from working
poverty families or underserved communities. The overall
school demographics also represent the demographics of the
participants of this study due to the fact that, as the sole
English teacher at the school, I serve and support more than
95% of the student body in either English III or English IV;
the only students who are not in one of my 10 class periods
are those who have already completed their English class
credits at a previous school. Consequently, this research will
reach nearly the entire student body and will provide insight
based on the broad range of students served at this institution
of learning. Although not an alternative school, the student
body presents various challenges that must be overcome by
the staff to assist students with graduation, foremost among
them academic achievement; the average grade point aver-
age (GPA) of students at this school is 1.30. This results in
teachers providing a significant focus on the remediation of
core skills in reading and math as well as constant socioemo-
tional support to help students gain greater levels of motiva-
tion and commitment to their learning and growth. It is the
commitment to this goal that served as the impetus for this
action research project, although the context of the site and
its participants present the following limitations: (a) a rela-
tively small sample size, (b) research and focus in a single
subject across only two grade levels, and (c) the integration
of a single, self-created student reflection instrument as a
tool for the intervention.
Materials and Conceptual Framework
This study began on January 22, 2013, with the introduction
of the reflection instrument that was used as an intervention
tool (see the appendix) and concluded about 8 weeks later on
March 22, 2013, when the final data were collected for anal-
ysis. The disconnection between the students' actual and
perceived abilities, as well as the disparity between their
motivation to complete assignments or exert their maximum
effort on academic tasks, prompted the development of this
research instrument because, to answer the research ques-
tion, it had to be ensured not only that the researcher would
be able to effectively integrate a structured, reflective activ-
ity into the classroom routine but also to establish if there
was a correlation between its implementation and students'
academic performance and motivation to complete their
assignments in class. The reflection instrument developed
was the only material outside of regular classroom curricu-
lum--such as books and project supplies--that was utilized
for intervention with the study participants.
The main issues that needed to be addressed in this study
were how to enhance the students' overall level of personal
empowerment in their abilities as well as to facilitate their
ability to think about their efforts from both an academic and
affective standpoint. This issue aligned well with the concept
of self-reflection; however, as discussed in the review of lit-
erature, this notion is multifaceted. Therefore, to define the
conceptual framework for this action research project, it was
decided to hone in on the practice of reflection as a method
for improved cognition to support students'overall academic
growth and intrinsic motivation to complete their tasks.
Desautel (2009) relayed that reflection had a strong connec-
tion with metacognition, which is a person's ability to think
about his or her own thinking. This enhanced level of self-
understanding and direction indicated the potential power to
lead toward improved intrinsic motivation, not only to com-
plete assignments and tasks but to also execute them to one's
fullest potential--thus resulting in improved academic per-
formance, as detailed by Ash et al. (2005), Lew and Schmidt
(2011), Sperling et al. (2012), McCormick et al. (2013),
and--as specifically examined for underserved high school
populations such as the context for this study--Cleary et al.
(2008).
Consequently, the reflection tool that was created was
specifically aimed at supporting the conceptual framework
of this study by stimulating students' metacognition through
structured and meaningful reflective prompts about their
work, thus resulting in the potential for improved academic
performance on future assignments as well as increased
motivation to complete their tasks effectively. These aspects
of academic performance and motivation, the dependent
variables, are the components of the research question that
will be measured and analyzed qualitatively and quantita-
tively both before and after the introduction of the indepen-
dent variable, the reflection instrument.
Procedure
Prior to the introduction of the intervention instrument, stu-
dents had not reflected on their work in any formal capacity;
therefore, introduction of this task was novel for the partici-
pants of the study. As a result, the researcher opted for a
8 SAGE Open
written reflection, as opposed to a verbal reflection, to allow
students sufficient time to process their thoughts and provide
meaningful insight into the various prompts given within the
reflective activity. Most assignments given in the classroom
context are completed in the actual classroom; therefore, the
completion of the reflection assignment took place in class
for the vast majority of the students. The intervention used in
this study was focused on each of the students in 10 class
period sections, five of which were English III and five of
which were English IV; students received the instrument
within the context of their 75-min class as part of their
assignment requirements. The intervention mechanism was a
structured reflection assignment that students were required
to complete and attach to each of their written English assign-
ments and was introduced and explained prior to its manda-
tory integration over the course of 12 possible assignments
during the treatment period. After assignments were col-
lected for grading, the reflection instruments were personally
removed and stored for qualitative analysis and evaluation
after the close of the data collection period.
To strengthen and add potential credence to the qualita-
tive data collected from the students' reflection instruments,
data were also collected from a quantitative standpoint to
assist with determining if a correlation existed between stu-
dent self-reflection and academic performance, student moti-
vation to complete assignments, or both. For baseline data
comparison, student data were collected from the second
marking period of the academic school year, which ran from
October 29, 2012, through January 17, 2013, and included no
discussion or implementation of structured reflective activi-
ties in class. The specific data collected for the purpose of
future comparison were the total number of missing assign-
ments per student for the academic marking period as well as
each of his or her summative report card grades, which rep-
resented the total average of all combined assignments on an
interval scale ranging from a possible 0% to 100%.
This same exact procedure was conducted at the conclu-
sion of the data collection period so that each student's over-
all number of missing assignments as well as his or her
overall academic performance could be compared with how
it was prior to the introduction of the reflection instrument.
Once the quantitative data were retrieved from the school's
approved grade-keeping software program, ProgressBook, it
was entered into Microsoft Excel for data analysis. Each stu-
dent who was enrolled in any class sections for both the sec-
ond and third marking period of the 2012-2013 academic
school year comprised one row of data that consisted of his
or her name, his or her total number of missing assignments
for the second marking period, his or her grade for the sec-
ond marking period, his or her total number of missing
assignments for the third marking period, and his or her final
grade for the third marking period; students who were with-
drawn during the data collection period or who were not
enrolled for either the full period of the baseline or interven-
tion periods were removed from the data collection.
Although I was present to guide students in how to com-
plete their reflections if needed, it was entirely up to them to
determine how to best answer the questions and prompts that
were presented to them on the intervention tool. Students
were asked to complete their reflections individually and
were told that their responses would not affect their assess-
ments in any way, thus promoting honesty and transparency
in the activity--anonymous submissions were also accepted
for students who were concerned that their reflections were
too personal or abrasive in nature. The supposition is that
student academic performance on assignments will increase
and that the overall number of missing assignments from stu-
dents will decrease while the treatment is in place. In addi-
tion, it is also the conviction that the possible correlation
between the independent and dependent variables could shed
light onto the potential power of reflection in the classroom
and could serve as the basis of its integration for teachers of
other subject areas at this school as well as for schools in
other underserved communities.
Data Analysis
The results of the quantitative research indicated that there
was a statistically insignificant correlation between student
self-reflection and academic performance and motivation to
complete assignments for underserved students in 11th- and
12th-grade English; however, analysis of the qualitative data
indicated that students' levels of metacognition and reaction
to the intervention were largely positive. Therefore, while
the hypothesis to the research question was not proved
through the quantitative data, the qualitative analysis pro-
vided a multitude of facts and considerations as presented
below.
Quantitative Analysis
The summative academic marking period grades for all par-
ticipants (n = 146) calculated to M = 73.68 prior to the reflec-
tive activity intervention and M = 73.47 after its
implementation. In addition to determining means, Pearson
correlations were run between the two sets of report card
grades as well as the number of missing assignments for the
second and third marking periods. A paired-sample t test was
also used to determine a possible statistical difference in stu-
dent grades after the treatment. There was a moderate to
strong correlation between the two sets of student grades, r =
.638, n = 146; the paired-sample t test indicated that the sta-
tistical difference between the two sets of summative grades
was not significant, t = 0.153, n = 146, df = 145, p = .879.
With regard to the total number of missing assignments for
the marking periods, the overall number missing from the
baseline period was 300 (M = 2.05, n = 146) versus 331 (M =
2.27, n = 146) for the intervention period, which brought the
overall percentage of missing assignments to 18.67% for the
collection period prior to the reflective activity and 18.89%
Cavilla 9
after its integration. There was a moderate to strong correla-
tion between the number of missing assignments from before
and after the treatment, r = .647, n = 146. The mean results
for both academic performance and overall number of miss-
ing assignments for each individual class section are sum-
marized in Table 1:
Qualitative Analysis
From the reflection instrument, student response data were
grouped based on (a) academic performance indicators, (b)
academic motivation indicators, and (c) affective motivation
indicators. The strongest indicator was for affective motiva-
tion, including reflection resulting in metacognition, with
84.3% of participants responding either favorably or show-
ing an indication of improved affective motivation or self-
efficacy for future motivation. This was followed by 74.8%
of students responding favorably to a commitment to future
academic motivation and 67.3% of students providing feed-
back and insight that related favorable to improved academic
performance. A summary and analysis of specific detail for
each of the indicators are presented below.
1. Academic Performance: For this indicator,
Questions 1 and 3 from the reflection instrument
were used to determine a positive or negative influ-
ence on students' academic performance based on
their responses to the question prompts. Overall,
67.3% of respondents indicated a positive change in
academic performance and relayed comments such
as the following:
Ihatewriting,butthisactivitymademerealizethatbrainstorming
to describe a topic makes the task easier for me.
At first I thought this assignment was boring, but now I can
relate to it and find this concept more interesting.
The end result of my assignment doesn't live up to my personal
expectations, so I will have to work harder on the next one.
I didn't like poetry before, but after reading the poems in class
and finding that they aren't hard to understand, I like them
better.
I discovered that poetry is like a puzzle with universal themes
that can be easily mistaken.
This assignment has made me work harder to try and succeed
and get a better grade.
This activity changed the way I comprehend. Now, I don't just
read the story and tell what it means, I also tell about its other
elements and structures and infer more.
In the future, I will elaborate more and use support from the text
in my responses to get a better grade.
I have learned that success requires me to look beyond what is
presented.
The remaining 32.7% of responses were either left blank
or indicated a negative change or attitude toward aca-
demic performance, including comments such as the
following:
This activity did not change my thinking at all.
I hated poetry before this assignment and still hate it.
My way of thinking about this topic has not changed.
I only completed this assignment for a grade.
2. Academic Motivation: For this indicator, Questions 2
and 5 from the reflection instrument were used to
determine a positive or negative influence on stu-
dents' academic motivation to complete assignments
based on their responses to the question prompts. In
total, 74.8% of respondents indicated a positive
change in current or future academic motivation and
relayed comments such as the following:

I did truly do everything I could to succeed, but I need to work
on my time management.
On future assignments, I will try harder and turn it in on time.
If I were to revisit this assignment, I would do more research and
look up better vocabulary words.
I need to organize my time better to make sure I succeed.
I would try harder and ask for more help instead of attempting to
understand it on my own.
I would change my work ethic completely and try much harder.
I would not miss the class that was given to go over this
assignment so I would not be rushing through this to get the rest
of my work done.
I would turn it in on time and not procrastinate as much.
I took advantage of all the time given to me and I worked
proficiently and tried my best.
The remaining 25.2% of responses were either left blank or
indicated a negative change or attitude toward academic
motivation and self-efficacy to complete assignments,
including feedback such as the following:
I would do nothing differently.
I never try my best on assignments in class.
It's okay. I could have done better, but choose not to.
No, I did not.
I rushed just to get the job done.
I procrastinated and didn't even finish.
3. Affective Motivation: For this indicator, Questions 4
and 6 from the reflection instrument were used to
determine a positive or negative influence on stu-
dents'affective motivation and self-efficacy based on
their responses to the question prompts. All in all,
84.3% of respondents indicated a positive change in
either affective motivation or improved self-efficacy
and shared comments including the following:
I now know that this work is not as hard as it seems, so next time
I won't overthink it and will just do it more calmly.
This task made me think about what else I need to learn in school
and life.
I am excited to learn more; I never knew how creative I could be!
I feel more motivated and confident in my abilities to work on
this topic in the future.
Poetry has boosted my emotions and made me think outside of
the box.
I feel I have the potential to influence my classmates because
they looked to me for help on this assignment; I now enjoy
helping other people more.
I have learned that there is more than my own perspective in the
meaning of things.
The passion I put into my responses would influence others
because it's organic and I feel that my realness is that others
expect and enjoy from me.
I now look at the work and the information in it much differently
to learn how it affects me and my life.
I am actually excited to read and learn new words now.
Poems and I are now on friendly terms. Not the best, but not the
worst like before.
I hope to inspire others to try their best and turn their work in on
time, like me.
The remaining 15.7% of responses were either left blank or
indicated a negative change or attitude toward affective
growth, intrinsic motivation, or self-efficacy, including
responses such as the following:
I don't have the ability to influence others.
I don't want to learn more about anything.
Nobody would listen to me or believe me anyway.
Nothing has changed and I still feel the same way.
No because I still have too much to learn to be able to influence
other people.
No because other people would have done better on this
assignment anyway.
Discussion
From a quantitative standpoint, the results showed that
reflection as a tool for enhanced metacognition, thus translat-
ing to improved academic performance or motivation to
complete assignments, had minimal to no overall effect.
Although the correlation between the sets of grades and
missing assignments was moderate to strong, the null hypoth-
esis for this study was that there would be no correlation
between baseline and postintervention results because a
Cavilla 11
significant growth in academic performance or a tremendous
change in the overall number of student missing assignments
would result in a weak to negligible correlation. Therefore,
the strength of the correlation for the overall groups of par-
ticipants supported the results of the statistical means of the
participants in both areas, both of which actually declined
very slightly from the baseline to the postintervention period.
Despite this overall scope of a lack of quantitative impact,
there were four sections that showed improved performance.
Sections 6, 8, and 10 all showed improvement in both aca-
demic performance as well as decline in the mean number of
missing assignments while Group 3 showed improved aca-
demic performance despite an actual increase in the overall
percentage of missing assignments. As a result of the inter-
pretation of the quantitative data, the hypothesis was not
proved: There was little to no correlation between student
reflection and improved academic performance and motiva-
tion to complete assignments for underserved students in
11th- and 12th-grade English. However, despite this lack of
quantitative proof, the qualitative proof yielded more posi-
tive results.
With regard to academic performance, more than two
thirds of participants conveyed partial to significant insight
toward enhanced academic performance. A majority of stu-
dents relayed exerting extra effort to achieve the maximum
grade possible as well as conveyed changing the way they
thought about the concepts taught after completion of les-
sons. While this growth may not have been evident in the
overall means of student grades, it was quite clear in their
responses on the reflection instrument. In addition, when
paring the data down to the individual student level, there
were some striking instances of growth, with a small portion
of students improving more than 40% from their perfor-
mance in the baseline period to the length of time that
included the reflective activity. Moreover, nearly three
fourths of students detailed specific examples and connec-
tions to improved academic motivation. Comments, as
shown in the aforementioned qualitative analysis, regarding
the tendency to procrastinate, to rush through work, to give
minimal effort, as well as insights that shed light on a portion
of students who were clearly empowered and gave their
maximum effort to complete assignments efficiently and on
time were significant.
This level and depth of thought, as well as the level of
transparency and willingness to voice the truth of the situa-
tion with regard to motivation and effort, clearly relayed that
the reflective activity caused students to think about their
approach, motivation, and efforts with regard to completion
of their tasks. Again, while this trend did not specifically
translate to the overall mean or percentage of missing assign-
ments decreasing for the entire group of participants, it
clearly indicated the potential for improvement and explained
why several students grew from missing nearly all assign-
ments for the second marking period to missing only one or
no assignments for the third marking period. Finally, the vast
majority of participants, more than 84%, presented indica-
tors for positive affective growth with regard to motivation
and/or self-efficacy on the reflection instrument, which is a
significant level of positive evidence for improved metacog-
nition as it relates to the potential for improved performance
and motivation in the future. Again, while this remarkable
level of positive indication did not translate into quantitative
improvement, it does show that the reflection instrument
either assisted with students' growth in the area of improved
metacognition or at least provided them with an outlet for
metacognitive thought that would not have necessarily been
available to them without the reflection instrument. While
these qualitative measures do not inherently prove the
hypothesis for this study, they do allow for educational stake-
holders to reflect on their possible implications as well as the
discrepancy between the expectations and outcomes of this
action research project.
Implications
Based on the observations of students made by the instructor
during this study, a paramount implication is that the power
of student self-reflection, as well as the seemingly positive
feedback that may come with it, does not inherently translate
into quantitative academic success or improvement for all
students or the participant group as a whole. This tenet is
supported not only by the personal observations made during
this study but also by the qualitative results of the reflective
instrument. Clearly, enhanced metacognition took place on
both an intellectual and affective level, as shown by the
majority of participants who responded positively to the
aforementioned indicators; however, these results did not
translate into improved academic performance or motivation
on a larger or more significant scale as hypothesized in the
research question. Therefore, while this action research has
skimmed the surface for the power of reflection in the class-
room, as well as provided a sound and firm foundation of
prior research and conceptual framework, there appears to be
additional elements required, such as additional time for
infusion of the intervention or improved instruction and
implementation of the reflective activity itself, to unleash the
full potential power of reflection as a tool for enhanced
metacognition.
Furthermore, it is evident that the overall number of stu-
dents' missing assignments directly link to their academic
performance--a fact that any seasoned teacher can easily
infer. As shown in the quantitative analysis, three of the four
sections that showed mild improvement in academic perfor-
mance all indicated an overall reduction in the amount of
missing work. Therefore, the power of reflection as a tool for
enhanced metacognition in the short term may be best uti-
lized initially simply to motivate underperforming students
to complete their tasks to avert bringing down their summa-
tive grades merely from a refusal to complete and turn in
assignments. Using this step as an initial approach, teachers
12 SAGE Open
could then continue to build upon the power of enhanced
metacognition by implementing activities and interventions
that allow students to examine their cognitive and intellec-
tual approaches toward their work, thus propelling them
toward substantial and long-lasting academic improvement.
The idea of this multistep approach toward reflection evokes
an interesting concept: Take an initial affective approach
with reflection to motivate students to embrace the responsi-
bility and willingness to attempt completion of required tasks
and then subsequently build on their newfound motivation to
further enhance improved academic performance through
reflective activities aimed at analyzing and evaluating the
approaches used in completion of those tasks. Using this
framework, the formula for effective integration of reflection
as a tool for durable and significant academic improvement
and motivation may require initial separation of affective and
cognitive processes followed by a reconnection of the two
modalities once initial progress has been established.
Given this potential ramification, it is important to note
that improved academic performance and motivation is not
entirely based in the cognitive arena; therefore, reflection
should not be relegated to this portion of the student psyche
either. In today's highly diversified classroom, students
arrive with a plethora of needs, some of which are intellec-
tual, some of which are social-emotional, and all of which
must be determined for each individual student and the con-
text that he or she is arriving from. The possibilities are
endless: an underachieving gifted student from a low-socio-
economic urban area, a student with a cognitive or emotional
disability from an affluent area, a higher performing student
who is frustrated with curriculum due to a language barrier, a
brilliant yet introverted student who is at risk due to bullying,
or simply an average, dominant culture student who appears
apathetic toward the curriculum due to prior negative experi-
ences or sudden life changes that result in a refocus of priori-
ties merely to survive. Given this exponential list of
possibilities and combinations, it is feasible to surmise that
without some level of affective intervention to remediate
possible affective duress students will struggle academically
or suffer from a decline in intrinsic motivation or self-effi-
cacy. Therefore, a tool that can be used in a highly individu-
alized and nonthreatening manner is reflection with a focus
on affective and social-emotional growth, which is a tactic
that deserves merit not only for serving the whole student but
also for its potential to enhance students' lives well beyond
the 180 days of the school year by providing an opportunity
for time to think about one's thinking and the implications of
how the daily interaction with life's quandaries can ulti-
mately lead to empowerment and success across the intel-
lectual, social, intrapersonal, and professional spectrums.
All in all, the most exigent implication of this study is the
revelation that, although student self-reflection as an inter-
vention for improved academic performance and motivation
may not yield the most staggering quantitative results in an
abbreviated time period, the approach of using reflection as
a tool to enhance and refine students' ability to develop
metacognition does not appear to be detrimental in any
aspect whatsoever. All results of this study indicate that
reflection as a tool for enhanced metacognition in either the
affective or cognitive framework only served to maintain
students' current academic performance and/or motivation
or improve it--sometimes significantly for students who
truly embraced the potential of its full impact. Therefore,
this action research suggests that despite the convoluted
nature of today's curriculum- and assessment-driven educa-
tional culture, reflection should not be rejected as a potential
detractor for academic performance or a meaningless part of
the hidden curriculum that merely serves to help students
feel better about themselves. Rather, it should be imple-
mented in a well-structured, intentional manner with pur-
poseful fidelity throughout the course of a student's
academic career so that it becomes ingrained within the very
way that he or she approaches the complex issues of intel-
lectual and social-emotional growth throughout his or her
life experience. If this task is accomplished, we have ful-
filled our mission as educators because our students deserve
more than a curriculum and instruction that teaches them
concepts and facts; they are entitled to the exposure of skills
and tactics that will allow them to develop into their full and
utmost potential as an individual, which is a sojourn that can
be traversed successfully through the power of
self-reflection.
