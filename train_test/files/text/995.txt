Study objective: To examine associations between social capital and individual risk for alcohol abuse and
harms and identify protective effect mechanisms.
Design: Multilevel multivariate analysis with individual level data from a national panel survey of drinking
and a contextual measure of social capital reflecting college mean aggregate reports of student
volunteerism. Outcomes include heavy episodic (binge) drinking, frequent drinking, frequent drunkenness,
diagnosable alcohol abuse, intentional drunkenness, acquisition of binge drinking, harms, secondhand
effects from others' drinking.
Setting: United States, 119 four year colleges.
Participants: Representative samples of youth ages 18­24 surveyed in 1997 and 1999 using an
anonymous mailed questionnaire (total n = 27 687).
Main results: Students from colleges with higher levels of social capital reported reduced risks for binge
drinking (adjusted OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.69, p = 0.002), frequent drunkenness (adjusted OR 0.58,
95% CI 0.34 to 0.98, p = 0.04), acquisition of binge drinking in college (adjusted OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to
0.95, p = 0.03), and alcohol abuse (adjusted OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.91, p = 0.02) in multilevel
multivariate analyses that controlled for individual volunteering, the measure on which social capital was
based. Higher levels of social capital protected against multiple drinking related harms (adjusted OR 0.51,
95% CI 0.29 to 0.90, p = 0.02) and secondhand drinking effects (adjusted OR, 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58,
p = 0.0003). Significant cross level interactions exist between fraternity/sorority membership and social
capital for measures of risky drinking. Harm reduction primarily reflects consumption modification.
Conclusions: Social capital exerts strong protective effects on alcohol abuse and harm in college including
among high risk students.
Researchers have identified a host of risk factors for
problem drinking among youth1 and are increasingly
attending to the influence on consumption and harms of
environmental factors related to alcohol's accessibility,
availability, price, and promotion.2­4 The emphasis across
studies has been on risk rather than protective factors. The
past decade has been a period of concentrated research
activity for studies of drinking in college.5 This may be
because college youth consume more than their non-college
attending peers,6 experience high levels of alcohol related
harm,7 and create problems for other students and for
neighbours.8 9 As with community studies, there is increasing
evidence that environmental factors influence alcohol con-
sumption and harms in college,10­13 with limited attention
paid to exploring protective factors.
One contextual factor that may provide protection from
high risk drinking in college is social capital, which describes
patterns of engagement, trust, and mutual obligation among
persons within social structures.14 Variously measured as
patterns of voluntary activity and associational life within a
community, levels of generalised social trust, reciprocity and
help among neighbours, and degree of civic engagement (for
example, voting behaviours), social capital is hypothesised to
facilitate governance and collective action to control
deviance, harms and threats, and/or to promote the public
good.14 Social capital has been described as operating within
the context of social networks and supports at individual
and even small group levels where the density and
interconnectedness of social ties may help individuals
procure tangible and intangible resources.15 While powerful,
this conceptualisation is predominantly individually based.16
Alternative models locate social capital at a more macro
community level, describing its essential qualities as those
related to cohesion, reciprocity, civic engagement, and levels
of social trust among members of a community.14 17 18 Our
conceptualisation of social capital recognises that while there
may be links and interrelationships between social networks/
supports and these larger social patterns of engagement,
cohesion, trust, and reciprocity, the former are nested within
the latter in an ecological fashion.19­21 In the case of high risk
drinking and harms among youth, it is this larger community
conception that is hypothesised to promote attachment
among youth for the larger community and norms counter
to heavy and harmful alcohol consumption.
Social capital may be an important contextual determinant
of health.22 With regard to alcohol abuse in college, social
capital's protective effect on heavy episodic or ``binge''
drinking was shown by Weitzman and Kawachi who
reported that exposure to higher than average levels of social
capital at the campus community level (measured as the
mean aggregate level of individual time spent volunteering
per day), significantly reduced individual risks of binge
drinking in a national study of over 14 000 respondents
surveyed across 140 colleges.23 That study is consistent with
others' findings that larger aspects of the social environment
analogous to social capital are linked to youth mental
health.24­27
The purpose of this study was to explore the protective
effects of social capital on a broader set of alcohol
consumption measures including diagnosable levels of
303

alcohol abuse, reports of primary and secondhand harms
related to alcohol consumption. A broad protective effect
would be consistent with our conceptualisation of social
capital that draws on collective socialisation and social
development models28 29 to predict that communities rich in
social capital will promote greater attachment among youth
for the larger community, norms that heavy drinking and
drunkenness are not acceptable, and compliance with laws
and policies restricting drinking among youth. The net effect
of these forces is expected to be lower individual risks for
heavy and abusive drinking and related harms. This study
also sought to identify whether any observed reduction in
harms (primary or secondhand) associated with social capital
would be realised as a consequence of reductions in
consumption or other individual or contextual factors not
captured in the relation between social capital and consump-
tion. Finally, this study sought to identify variations in
effect for students affiliated with campus fraternity and
sorority (or Greek) organisations at high and low social
capital campuses. These organisations were originally
formed to promote social support and advancement among
students and can include a service component. Nevertheless,
Greek membership confers considerable risk for heavy
drinking and harms and Greek organisations are often at
the centre of alcohol abuse problems on campus.30 Exploring
whether excess drinking risks among fraternity/sorority
members can be offset by exposure to social capital may
help clarify the magnitude and homogeneity of any protective
effect.
METHODS
Sources of data
This study draws on data from the 1997 and 1999 Harvard
School of Public Health College alcohol study (CAS), an
anonymous self report mailed survey that has been adminis-
tered four times to a nationally representative sample of
American college students. It was originally administered in
1993 to random samples of full time undergraduate students
at a sample of 140 four year colleges and universities.31
Random samples of students were surveyed at 130 of 140
original schools in 1997 and at 128 of the schools in 1999.32
The total sample size combining 1997 and 1999 was 28 862.
After excluding schools with response rates lower than 50%,
the final sample size used in this study was 27 687 from 119
schools. Detailed survey methodology has been published
elsewhere.31 32 Protocols for both national surveys on which
this research is based were reviewed and approved by the
HSPH Office of Human Subjects Research.
Outcome measures
Four categories of alcohol related outcomes are reported: (1)
alcohol abuse; (2) alcohol consumption patterns; (3) alcohol
related harms; (4) secondhand effect of others' drinking. To
measure alcohol abuse, we adapted the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders­fourth edition (DSM-IV)33
alcohol abuse criteria to the college setting following
previously published methods34 in which each of four alcohol
abuse criteria was matched to self reports of specific drinking
harms over the past academic year as they affected
respondents' primary social role as student (table 1). Next
we assessed six measures of alcohol consumption. Among
students who had at least one drink in the past month we
examined: drinking on 10 or more occasions during the past
month, usual number of drinks consumed on a drinking
occasion (five or more compared with fewer than five),
experiencing drunkenness three or more times in the past
month, and drinking in order to get drunk. For all students
we evaluated binge drinking status, defined as the consump-
tion of five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past
two weeks for men and four or more drinks in a row for
women.35 We also assessed taking up binge drinking in
college among freshman who reported they were not binge
drinkers in high school.12
Experience of drinking related harms was evaluated since
the beginning of the school year, including reports students:
had a hangover; missed a class; fell behind in schoolwork;
did something they later regretted; forgot where they were
or what they did; argued with friends; engaged in
unplanned sexual activity; did not use protection when
having sex; damaged property; got into trouble with campus
or local police; got hurt or injured; required medical
treatment for an alcohol overdose. A composite variable
was also created describing experience of five or more of the
above mentioned harms as an indication of the intensity of
harms from drinking in this population consistent with other
studies.36
Among non-binge drinkers we assessed experience since
the beginning of the school year of eight adverse effects
attributable to others' drinking including reports students:
were insulted or humiliated; had a serious argument or
quarrel; had been pushed, hit, or assaulted; had their
property damaged; had to ``babysit'' or take care of another
student who drank too much; had their studying or sleep
interrupted; experienced an unwanted sexual advance; or,
had been a victim of sexual assault or date rape. A composite
variable describing experiencing of three or more of the above
mentioned secondhand effects of others' drinking was also
examined. Use of a three or more secondhand effects
measure provides an indication of the intensity of community
harms from others' drinking in this population consistent
with other studies.37
Independent variables
Social capital was operationalised as a continuous variable
assessing particapants' average daily time committed to
volunteering in the past 30 days aggregated to the campus
level. The time spent in volunteerism at the school level
reflects a core feature of the social capital construct--its
``public good'' element, and shows the students' dedication to
the group or collective.16 23 Within the college population in
which time may be tight and youth may exhibit both their
idealism and norms about reciprocity and engagement
through volunteerism, the mean aggregate levels of voluntary
behaviour at the community level may be a meaningful
indicator of social capital on a campus. We used a
parsimonious contextual measure created from this single
variable to describe social capital. Other related variables
describing participation in student groups and political
organisations did not improve the reliability of the estimate
of social capital when composited with the variable on
voluntary behaviour and measured contextually. Individual
volunteerism (h/day) was included as a control variable. Also
included in the models were individual level covariates that

(white compared with non-white), socioeconomic status
(SES) (operationalised as parental educational attain-
ment--high: both parents had college education, middle:
either father or mother had college education, low: neither
parents went to college), and fraternity or sorority member-
ship. The analysis also adjusted for school level characteristics
including public compared with private institution, enrol-
ment size, geographical region, and response rate.
Analysis
Multilevel logistic regression models based on a logit-link
function were used38 to take into account the potential for
individual outcomes to cluster by campus. All the analyses
were fitted using MLwin multilevel software (version
1.10.0006)39 with marginal quasilikelihood (MQL) first order
estimation procedures being applied. We first present the
basic demographic characteristics. Then, a two level random
intercept model with individual students at level 1, nested
within colleges at level 2 was fit to assess the effect of school
social capital on dichotomised alcohol related outcomes
controlling for individual and school level covariates.
Effects of social capital on drinking related harms and
secondhand effects were estimated before and after control-
ling for patterns of consumption at individual and college
levels respectively to assess the degree to which any
protective effects of social capital on harms operated
independently of consumption.
To test whether social capital modified the risk of alcohol
abuse among Greek affiliated students, we tested the cross
level interaction between Greek membership and campus
social capital on study outcomes, controlling for all relevant
individual and college covariates and for the main effects of
individual volunteering and Greek membership. We also

aggregated levels of volunteerism ranged from 0.25 hour
(15 minutes) to 0.98 hour (about 1 hour), with a mean of
0.46 hour, or about 28 minutes (SD = 0.14). Individual
volunteerism was minimally correlated with campus levels
of volunteerism (our measure of social capital) (r = 0.14,
p,0.0001). Considerable variation at the college level was
evident across measures of drinking style. Across the 119
surveyed colleges, we observed the average prevalence, range,
and standard deviation of alcohol abuse, frequent drinking,
frequent drunkenness, and binge drinking to be respectively:
27.8% (0.26%­53%) standard deviation 10.6%; 14.0% (0%­
34.2%), standard deviation 6.9%; 18.2% (0%­47.49%), stan-
dard deviation 9.9%; 43.9% (0%­79.8%), standard deviation
14.7%.
Overall, women, non-white students, older aged (.23
years), or students from lower socioeconomic status back-
grounds were less likely to use/abuse alcohol, report drinking
related harms, or experience secondhand effects; while
fraternity/sorority or Greek membership were associated with
higher odds of drinking problems, alcohol related harms, or
secondhand effects (table 2). Students who spent more time
on volunteer work were less likely to use or abuse alcohol, or
report drinking related harms. However, they were more
likely to experience secondhand effects of other students'
drinking. Students attending schools with high levels of
social capital were less likely to report heavy and abusive
drinking, drinking related harms, and secondhand effects.
Protective effects of social capital on alcohol abuse, acquisi-
tion, or uptake of binge drinking, frequent and intentional
drunkenness persisted after controlling for a range of
individual and contextual characteristics and for individual
time volunteering (table 3). For example, each one hour
increase in aggregated levels of campus volunteerism
corresponded to a 45% decrease in the probability of having
an alcohol abuse disorder among college students (adjusted
odds ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence intervals 0.34 to 0.91),
after adjustment for age, sex, race, SES, students' member-
ship, and school characteristics. Based on this, a one quarter
hour increase in aggregated levels of campus volunteerism
would decrease college students' alcohol abuse by more than
11%.
Significant cross levels interactions exist between social
capital and Greek membership for four alcohol related
outcomes--binge drinking, frequent binge drinking, inten-
tional, and frequent drunkenness. Increased risk for these
outcomes among Greek affiliated students was reduced to
that of their non-Greek peers when levels of school social
capital were high (fig 1). There were no interactions between
Greek membership and individual volunteering for these or
other drinking outcomes.
Higher levels of school social capital were associated with
decreased probabilities of several drinking related harms
(table 4). For each one hour increase in aggregate school level
volunteerism we would expect a 49% decrease in reporting
harms associated with alcohol use (OR = 0.51, 95% con-
fidence interval = 0.29 to 0.90). By this measure, a one
quarter hour increase in aggregated levels of campus
volunteerism would decrease college students' alcohol related
harm more than 12%. Protective effects on drinking related
harms were attenuated by controlling for measures of
drinking style (second set of data columns, table 4) showing
that social capital's protective effect on harms operates
mainly through modifying consumption.
After controlling for individual and school characteristics,
students attending colleges with higher levels of social capital
were also less likely to suffer from the consequences of other
students' drinking problems (table 4). Each one hour
increase in campus social capital was associated with a 70%
reduced probability of suffering from secondary harms of
other students drinking (OR = 0.30, 95% confidence inter-
val = 0.16 to 0.58). Based on this, we would expect to see
more than a 17% decrease in alcohol related secondhand
effects among non-bingers if campus levels volunteerism
increased by one quarter hour. Diminution of secondhand
effects after controlling for drinking style (second set of data
columns, table 4) suggests that social capital's protective
effect operates mainly through consumption.
DISCUSSION
Students from colleges with higher levels of social capital
reported reduced risks for binge drinking, frequent and
intentional drunkenness, the acquisition or uptake of binge
drinking in college, and patterns of alcohol abuse indicative
of a more serious psychiatric problem in multilevel analyses
that take into consideration the effects of demographic, social
network, affiliative, and institutional characteristics, and that
simultaneously control for individual patterns of voluntary
activity, the measure on which social capital was based.
Findings are consistent with earlier reports23 and with our
hypothesis about the role of social capital in protecting
against deviance and threat, as shown by more problematic
drinking styles. Exposure to higher levels of social capital was
also associated with lower odds of experiencing a range of
drinking related harms, multiple harms, secondhand effects
from others' drinking, and multiple secondhand effects. The
protective effects of social capital on outcomes operated
mainly through moderating consumption as evidenced by
attenuated effects of social capital on harms after controlling
for consumption (table 4).
Increased risks for heavy and frequent drinking, inten-
tional and frequent drunkenness among Greek affiliated
students was almost fully offset by exposure to high levels of
social capital at the campus community level (fig 1). This
effect was evident after controlling for individual voluntary
activity, for which there was no parallel interaction with
Greek affiliation.
Findings answer questions about the consistency of social
capital's risk modifying effect on consumption by examining
its effects across a range of drinking measures. They also
show social capital's protective effect on harms. Questions
about underlying mechanisms remain. We do not yet
understand why social capital depresses drinking and we
know nothing about whether it can be generated, supported,
or harnessed to intentionally aid prevention. Future work
Key points
N Among a nationally representative sample of young
adults in college in the United States, exposure to high
contextual levels of social capital was associated with
significantly lower individual risk for measures of abuse
and DSM-IV abuse of alcohol, drinking related harms,
and secondhand effects from others' drinking.
N Additionally, increased odds for alcohol abuse among
high risk fraternity/sorority affiliated students was
significantly offset by exposure to social capital rich
communities.
N The protective effect of social capital on drinking harms
and secondhand effects was attributable almost entirely
to its moderating effects on consumption. Social capital
rich communities in which many youth volunteer
protect against alcohol abuse and harms, among the
most common and serious health issues facing young
populations.

might well address the interrelation of social capital with
other factors including alcohol policies and prevention
programmes and with academic and social requirements for
volunteering and community service, and explore protective
effects for other subgroups of youth.30 Additional work might
also use operational definitions of social capital that tap
different components of the construct.
Findings that risk associated with fraternity/sorority
association can be offset by exposure to high levels of social
capital emphasise the power of this construct and importance
of considering individual and environmental interactions.
These findings and the ongoing debate about social capital's
potential to exclude, ``bond'', or ``bridge'' groups15 40 suggest
examining effects among lesser status groups, including
racial and ethnic minority students. We think that higher
levels of social capital in college communities signal more
egalitarian and therefore healthier places where psychologi-
cal needs for drinking are fewer, as findings about social
capital's protective effects on intentional drunkenness
suggest. Findings about the protective effects of campus
demographic diversity on drinking and harms among both
majority and minority students in college support the
potential for this more positive interpretation.41
Confidence in this study's findings is increased given our
large representative survey sample, multiple measures of
alcohol consumption and harm, and use of an established if
single indicator of social capital. Nevertheless, we cannot
generalise results beyond four year US colleges. Potential bias
may have been introduced through non-response and
attrition. A short form of the questionnaire sent to non-
responders indicated no difference in past year alcohol use
between responders to the short form and those responding
to the entire survey.32 Moreover, we minimised threats from
selection bias through use of a direct standardisation
procedure for all study measures that reflected adjustment
along eight strata (gender by two age groups (,22 compared
with others) by two ethnic groups (white compared with
others)), using each school's true demographic characteristic
in a referent year. Furthermore, we controlled for response
rate in the analyses and restricted analyses to colleges with
response rates of 50% or greater. The response rate for
individual schools was not associated with rates of heavy
episodic drinking.32 Rates of heavy episodic drinking and
other substance use were almost identical to rates obtained
by other US surveys.6 42 Results were based on self report
mailed questionnaires, which are subject to response
bias. However, self report surveys are commonly used in
examining alcohol use and are generally considered valid.43
Finally, the cross sectional design limits conclusions regard-
ing directionality of associations.

Policy implications
N Policy and prevention professionals working with
youth/young adult populations should develop and
evaluate a broader range of community strategies for
preventing alcohol abuse.
N Included among promising strategies for demonstra-
tion evaluation and possibly widespread dissemination
should be those that support patterns of engagement
among youth for the larger community, development of
service learning and volunteer programmes for youth
as part of their higher educational and school
experiences.
N Building communities through promoting connections
among youth and between youth and their surrounding
institutions should be priorities for helping tackle
prevalent problems of abuse of alcohol.
