Abstract: This paper assesses the methodology employed in longitudinal studies of
advertising and youth drinking and smoking behaviors. These studies often are given a
causal interpretation in the psychology and public health literatures. Four issues are
examined from the perspective of econometrics. First, specification and validation of
empirical models. Second, empirical issues associated with measures of advertising
receptivity and exposure. Third, potential endogeneity of receptivity and exposure variables.
Fourth, sample selection bias in baseline and follow-up surveys. Longitudinal studies
reviewed include 20 studies of youth drinking and 26 studies of youth smoking. Substantial
shortcomings are found in the studies, which preclude a causal interpretation.

1. Introduction
The health and welfare of adolescents is a major topic within health economics. Considerable
attention has been paid in recent years to examination of risky behaviors by youth, such as smoking,
drinking, drunk driving, drug use, unprotected sex, and crime [1-6]. These activities are often first
undertaken prior to the age of nineteen, but can have important implications for longer-term health and
welfare of adults. In this context, a possible definition of risky behavior is that the activity involves
short-term benefits and potential longer-term costs. For example, the decision by a youth to engage in
smoking or binge drinking has short-term payoffs that are both personal and social in nature. The
OPEN ACCESS
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 871
longer-term costs can include adverse impacts on individual health, employability, longevity, marital
stability, and other outcomes. Social external costs also can arise, either immediately or in the long
run [7-9]. The ability of youth to weigh immediate benefits against potential adverse consequences is
the subject of debate within economics and psychology. For economics, a starting point for modeling
risky decisions is expected utility maximization whereby individuals weigh expected benefits against
expected costs with exponential (time-consistent) preferences. In the rational addiction model due to
Becker and Murphy [10-12], utility-maximizing individuals also incorporate interdependencies among
past, current, and future consumption. Short-term benefits derived from current consumption are
weighed against long-run costs, which include monetary and implicit costs associated with
accumulated stocks of the addictive activity. A refutable hypothesis is that past, current, and future
prices affect current consumption. Empirical tests of the rational addiction hypothesis have been
carried out for several risky behaviors, including alcohol use, smoking, drug use, gambling, and
obesity [13-17]. Several theoretical and econometric issues remain unresolved in the literature,
especially when aggregate data are used [18-20].
Developmental psychology, as summarized by Fischoff [21], defines risk-taking as any action
involving at least one uncertain outcome, where the outcome can be positive (winning a lottery) or
negative (drug addiction). Hence, risk-taking is the deliberate choice of a risky behavior. The choice
may be a single or infrequent behavior (drunk drinking) or a sequence of repeated behaviors (daily
drinking). There should be voluntary choice at some point if an individual is to be described as taking
risks, rather than just bearing them. According to Fischoff [21], the decision to undertake risky
behavior is affected by an individual`s cognitive development (how people think about the world);
affective development (how people feel about the world); and social development (roles that others
play in people`s choices). For risky decisions, debate exists regarding the future orientation of youth
compared to adults [18,22]. For example, some psychology studies report that consequences of risky
activities involving social reactions are considered more heavily by teenagers than by adults, although
the two groups are remarkably similar overall [23]. Peer pressure does not generally imply extreme
forms of irrationality or purely emotional decision-making, but youth might react non-optimally to the
intrinsic costs and benefits that they face. From an economic perspective, policies can be designed to
manipulate incentives so as to better align perceived immediate benefits with longer-term social goals.
Altering prices through the use of tax policy is one such example [24-30], but changing the regulatory
or informational environment for risky decisions also can affect perceptions and incentives.
Now consider an environment in which the information used in decision-making is partly under the
control of producers, such as the advertising messages and promotional campaigns used by producers
of alcohol and tobacco. These messages might alter incentives to engage in underage drinking and
smoking by glamorizing the activity, by altering perceptions of the risks involved with the activity or
by altering perceptions of pervasiveness among peers and adults [31,32]. For example, the 1994
Surgeon General`s report [33] opines that cigarette advertising appears to affect young people`s
perceptions of the pervasiveness, image, and function of smoking (p195). Psychologists use the term
false consensus effect to describe individuals who perceive that their beliefs, choices or behaviors
are relatively common [34]. The advertising messages also can be targeted to appeal to well-defined
consumer groups or market segments according to dimensions such as age, gender, ethnicity, income,
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 872
occupation, lifestyle, and past experience with the product. In the Bayesian learning model of addictive
behavior due to Orphanides and Zervos [35], inexperienced individuals are initially uncertain of the
potential harm associated with consumption of addictive products such as cigarettes. Each individual
possesses a subjective belief or prior probability concerning his or her potential to become addicted,
and this belief structure is updated with information gained from past consumption, peer behavior,
schooling, advertising, and other marketing activities. In particular, advertising might alter the prior on
the incidence of harmful addiction by changing youths` smoker prototypes or their perceptions of the
pervasiveness of smoking. Due to misperceptions, some experimenters with tobacco become addicted
and may experience regret at a later point in life. Further, the misperception can be associated with
social external costs. If accurate, the Bayesian model of addiction has implications for the content,
placement, and amount of advertising and promotion that is permitted for risky products, especially
those that involve youth or other inexperienced consumers.
On the other hand, advertising seeks to persuade and everyone knows it, even quite young
children [36,37]. Consumers have reason to be skeptical of claims and images in advertisements
because they recognize that ads represent producers` self-interest, and sellers are aware that consumers
are skeptical [38]. For this reason, consumers ignore or belittle many ads, but producers have an
incentive to better match brands to consumer preferences and to compete with other sellers by
informing consumers of this match. Consumers learn what brands to trust, so existing competitors and
new sellers must work to overcome this trust, also known as brand loyalty. This essentially competitive
process is most evident in the case of price advertising, where a series of economic studies have shown
that bans of price advertising increase product prices [38,39]. More generally, by reducing information
and restricting entry of new products and producers, advertising bans can entrench market shares and
create market power for existing producers. Even in the case of persuasive advertising, such as that
carried out for alcohol and tobacco products, there are self-correcting mechanisms in place. For
example, advertisers sometimes engage in comparative (less-bad) brand advertising that also informs
consumers of inherent risks associated with the product [38]. Advertising for well-known products
with static markets (i.e., mature products) rarely serves to increase industry sales, so a producer`s
incentive often is to increase the number of its brands and direct its appeals for patronage to market
segments. Some highly-advertised brands do better in the marketplace, but it is a fallacy to argue that
successful advertising by one producer implies that all producers do better by advertising more [40,41].
However, advertising might be objectionable if it affects youthful consumers of restricted products,
even if the products are legal for adults. Does mass-media advertising for alcohol and tobacco affect
youth behaviors in a significant manner? How strong an influence is advertising and other marketing
promotions? Most of the research directly bearing on these questions is found in survey studies carried
out by psychologists and public health researchers. In particular, prospective cohort (longitudinal)
studies are regarded as evidence of a causal relationship between marketing activities and drinking and
smoking behaviors. Lovato et al. [42] argue that longitudinal studies . . . capture what happens to
individuals over time and can demonstrate whether individuals who differ in their exposure to
advertising when they are not smoking, then differ in their future smoking behaviour (p3). In a
longitudinal study, a sample of youth is interviewed at least twice. During the initial or baseline survey,
information is collected about each respondent`s use of alcohol or tobacco and his or her receptivity or
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 873
exposure to mass media advertising and other marketing practices (branded merchandise, exposure in
cinema and videos, etc.). All information on receptivity and exposure is self-reported, although various
manipulations of these data are often performed such as combining responses to several survey
questions to form an index. Data also are collected on possible covariates such as age, gender, race,
ethnicity, family environment, parental education, school performance, and so forth. During one or
more follow­up surveys, each individual`s drinking or smoking behavior is measured again. The
follow-up survey usually is conducted one or two years later, but shorter and longer durations are
possible. The behavior status at follow-up is typically analyzed using a logistic regression model,
which computes the odds ratio of progression from, say, non-smoking to smoking status conditional on
baseline receptivity and other covariates. It is argued that cross-sectional and time-series studies
provide weaker correlational evidence because it is unclear if advertising exposure preceded the
drinking or smoking outcomes [42,43]. Nevertheless, it is common practice for studies and reviews to
cite these other methodologies if they provide supportive evidence [31,32].
Many longitudinal studies are based on Social Cognitive Theory, which incorporates aspects of
social and cognitive development and learning [44,45]. Social cognitive theory suggests that a
combination of environmental (social) and personal or cognitive factors influence behaviors (beliefs,
attitudes, perceptions). Requirements for people to learn and model behavior are often divided into
attention (attending to an advertisement); retention (remembering a brand); reproduction (initiating or
intending to initiate product use); and motivation to adopt the behavior (net positive reinforcement).
Advertising`s role is characterized as symbolic modeling [32], in which the medium of observation is
through mass media (such as television or movies) rather than face-to-face observation (such as a
parent and child) . . . [however] audiences are conceived as complex and active agents in the
person-media relationship (p32). More specifically, expectancy beliefs are central to social cognitive
theory, whereby individuals form symbolic beliefs or representations about the anticipated benefits and
costs associated with a given behavior [46,47]. Using the technique of path analysis, elaborate models
of expectancy theory have been constructed [40,47]. Compared to economic models, psychological
models focus more on the process of decision making, which requires consideration of a wide variety
of factors that might affect youthful decisions.
Several recent articles provide reviews of longitudinal studies of advertising and youth alcohol or
tobacco behaviors [31,32,42,48-50]. These reviews conclude that advertising and marketing influence
youth to use alcohol and tobacco, although the magnitude is sometimes labeled modest. However,
the reviews provide simple narratives that focus on basic methodology and empirical results, especially
results that conform to social learning theories. Assessments of the empirical model specification and
statistical testing are frequently brief or absent. Assessments of the overall significance and magnitude
are not reported in a summary fashion. Publication bias is ignored [51]. Despite the weaknesses in the
studies and reviews, strong policy recommendations often are presented, such as calls for bans of all
alcohol and tobacco advertising including passive advertising at sponsored sports events and similar
venues. Given these past recommendations, the objective of this review is to provide a critical
assessment of the modeling framework employed in longitudinal studies, the statistical procedures
utilized, and empirical results achieved in such studies. In particular, I demonstrate that many
longitudinal studies are seriously incomplete or ignore statistical problems and solutions that are
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 874
well-known in econometrics, including issues of specification bias, measurement error, endogeneity,
and sample selection bias. My conclusion is that the emphasis on advertising bans and similar
regulations in the public health literature is misplaced. More effective policies need to be sought to
deal with issues of youthful risk-taking associated with alcohol and tobacco.
It is of course possible for advertising to have a null or negative effect on the behaviors of adults
and youth, and some longitudinal studies do report such results. Indeed, among economists, there is a
long-standing belief that advertising does not have a large impact on aggregate product sales, either
positive or negative [52]. There are three main reasons why advertising and other marketing activities
may fail to influence behaviors. First, advertising can affect brand shares only with no effect
whatsoever on initial purchase or eventual consumption, other than the choice of a particular brand.
That is, the effect of advertising is purely redistributive even at the initial point in a consumer`s
consumptive history. This is referred to as the weak or predatory theory of advertising [53].
Second, advertising can increase brand loyalty for some producers, which in turn increases the price
that profit-maximizing producers find optimal. The increase in product price, which arises because the
consumers` demand function is rendered less elastic, reduces product demand. Additionally, due to
advertising, consumer preferences or demand may be shifted or concentrated more in higher-quality
(higher-priced) brands, so the indirect effect of higher prices can offset any direct effect of advertising.
Third, advertising may raise costs and thereby increase product prices and reduce demand. In the
context of an oligopoly, this is a prisoners` dilemma equilibrium since all firms might be better off at
a lower level of advertising. Although mixed results are reported, empirical research on the market for
cigarettes demonstrate that restrictions on mass media advertising tend to lower consumption primarily
by reducing price competition [54-56], so the direct effect of the restrictions is possibly benign.
Overall, there are reasons to be skeptical that advertising plays a substantial role in youthful decisions
to drink or smoke, over and above the choice of a particular brand.
The remainder of this review is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief summary of trends
in adolescent drinking and smoking, using data for the US from the annual Monitoring the Future
survey. Section 3 outlines some of the validation problems associated with empirical studies. Section 4
presents a summary of 20 longitudinal studies of youth drinking and 26 studies of youth smoking. The
focus in this section is on model specification and testing, including critical analysis of measures used
for receptivity and exposure to marketing and advertising. Tabular summaries are used to present the
main features of the various studies and their findings. Section 5 analyzes longitudinal methodology
with a focus on two advanced econometric issues, endogeneity and sample selection bias. Section 6 is a
discussion of the findings, including a brief analysis of alternative methodologies presenting evidence
on the effects of advertising bans for alcohol and tobacco. Section 7 contains the conclusions. Overall,
the review finds that longitudinal studies of advertising and youth drinking-smoking behaviors contain
significant econometric and statistical problems, which preclude a causal interpretation. Some
suggestions are offered for improving the research in this area.
2. Trends in Adolescent Drinking and Smoking: Monitoring the Future
Systematic annual data on the prevalence of underage drinking and smoking in the US are collected
and tracked by several organizations. This section relies on data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF)
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 875
survey, which is an annual school-based survey conducted every spring since 1975. The most recent
survey for 2009 includes information for about 45,000 secondary students in the 8th, 10th and 12th
grades (ages 13­18). Selected information also is reported by MTF for full-time undergraduate college
students (ages 19­22) and young adults ages 19­28 who are high school graduates. Alcohol data
collected by MTF include any use in the past 30 days, daily use in the past 30 days, consumption of
five or more drinks in the past 30 days, annual and lifetime use of alcohol. Various data also are
collected on prevalence of drunkenness, type of beverage consumed, perceived risks and harms, and
attitudes about disapproval and legality of underage drinking, heavy drinking, and drunkenness.
Tobacco data collected by MTF include 30-day use, daily use, half-pack or more per day, annual and
lifetime use of cigarettes. Various data also are collected on perceived risks of smoking, disapproval,
use of smokeless tobacco, attitudes toward cigarette use, and ease of availability of tobacco products.
For both products, subgroup data are reported by grade level, gender, race, etc. However, cautionary
use of these data is necessary due to nonresponses (both individuals and schools) and inaccurate
responses [57]. Other social processes, such as the stigmatization of tobacco use, also complicate
interpretation of the data, leading to inferences that are at best tentative.
Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2 display the available information in the MTF surveys on 30-day
prevalence for any use of alcohol and tobacco. Across grade levels, alcohol and tobacco use is high, but
declining over time. Prevalence levels in the US also are below those in many other developed
countries [58,59]. For alcohol, the trend for secondary students is toward lower levels of use, with an
apparent slowing of the rate of decline in the mid-1990s followed by steady decline since the year
2000. One explanation for the decline is a higher minimum legal drinking age, which for the US has
been 21 years in all states since the year 1989. For cigarettes, there is a sharp decline over time in
smoking prevalence, although not always uniformly. The early 1980s was a steady period for
prevalence as judged by 12th grade smoking, followed by a rise in the early 1990s. Since 1995, there
has been a sharp decline in smoking at all age levels. Enactment of stricter regulations again played a
role, but increased social stigma is probably important. However, smoking in the US is not federally
illegal at ages younger than 18 as only the purchase of tobacco products is regulated. Some individual
states have enacted laws making possession by a minor illegal or have increased the legal age for
purchase. What else explains these trends? This turns out to be a surprisingly difficult question to
answer, but higher real prices play an important role for tobacco products [60-62].

These trends also are of possible importance for longitudinal survey studies. First, the trend data
show little change over short periods of one to three years, but there can be important changes over
longer periods of time. Longitudinal studies that conduct a follow-up survey after more than three years
may be capturing some of the trends revealed in the MTF data. Second, one possible way of explaining
the trend in youth prevalence is to show that it is related to similar trends in adult behavior as shown by
Cook and Moore [61], Gruber [62], and Nelson [63]. However, causality is unclear. The importance of
adult behaviors may be that there is a direct effect if youth are influenced by adult prevalence. On the
other hand, it can be that the adult and youth levels and trends reflect common underlying factors, such
as a greater value placed on long-term health or similar responses to price changes. In either case, this
reinforces the importance of accounting for a wide variety of factors in longitudinal studies, especially
those covariates related to parental and peer behaviors.

3. Research Designs and Validity
It is useful to begin by thinking about an ideal research design, which is an experimental or
randomized controlled trial. Suppose each youth in a random sample is to receive a specific treatment
or dose of advertising, which is assigned by a random mechanism. Random selection and assignment
of youth insures that the study groups are unbiased. Some groups may receive no treatment whatsoever,
so there is a well-defined control group. The effect of the treatment could be measured on a
before-after basis for each treated group, but the use of a control group can detect any placebo effects
associated with the experiment. It is widely recognized that ethical considerations as well as practical
problems restrict the use of experimental studies for advertising and youth drinking or smoking. In
addition, no single experiment could capture the vast array of advertising and marketing methods used
by producers. Any true experiment might underestimate the overall effects of advertising because only
a limited number of key factors are studied at once [42]. Although some experimental studies of
advertising have been conducted, they will not be reviewed here.
An alternative to a randomized trial is a quasi-experimental research design, where the treatment
groups and comparison groups are not randomly assigned [64,65]. For example, econometric studies of
advertising bans entail a statistical analysis of groups subject to complete or comprehensive bans,
partial bans, and no bans of advertising. Both cross-section and time-series variation in the treatment
may be present, so the data comprise a panel of observations. A natural experiment occurs if there is
an exogenous source of variation across the groups, which might lead to changes in some important
outcome. In his study of alcohol advertising bans, Nelson [66] argues that membership in the European
Economic Union (EEU) constitutes a natural experiment for analysis of advertising bans and cross-
country per capita alcohol consumption. EEU legal authority had the effect of changing advertising
regulations independent of other country-specific influences on drinking. Other economic studies that
might fall generally under the heading of quasi-experiments are reviewed in Section 6. An alternative
quasi-experimental research design, widely used in psychology and public health, is a longitudinal
survey study. Lovato et al. [42] argue that longitudinal studies can isolate the causal effect of
advertising under the following conditions: (1) the advertising treatment must clearly precede the
hypothesized effect; (2) behavior is measured at baseline and in one or more follow-ups; and (3) there
are controls for possible confounding factors, such as age, gender, race, peer smoking, parental
smoking, and so forth. Further, in most studies, a narrowly-defined cohort is selected based on age or
school grade. This selection rules out some time-invariant confounders. Because the behavior
measurements are essentially forward-looking, longitudinal studies reviewed here also are called
prospective cohort studies.
Both longitudinal and econometric studies must address a number of general problems if empirical
results are to be considered valid and possibly valuable for other purposes, such as policy design. Many
problems arise due to the non-randomness of the treatment and comparison groups. If not addressed,
these problems undermine any causal interpretation of the studies, so they are labeled threats to
validity [65]. As defined by Campbell [67], internal validity refers to the confidence with which a
causal relationship between two variables can be drawn. External validity refers to the confidence with
which a presumed causal relationship can be generalized beyond the specific sample, setting, and time
studied. Examination of internal validity is best carried out on a study-by-study basis, but the task of a
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 878
review in part is to determine the external validity of a set of studies. The main threats to internal
validity for longitudinal and econometric studies are as follows [65]:
1. Omitted variables: Personal characteristics of respondents and intervening events other than the
treatment that provide alternative explanations for the outcomes. Omission of relevant explanatory
variables results in specification bias, which is discussed further below.
2. Trends in outcomes: As explained above, there can be processes at work that are mainly a
function of the passage of time per se, which may go undetected in the study.
3. Mismeasurement: A critical factor in longitudinal and econometric studies is the accurate
measurement of advertising and marketing activities for alcohol and tobacco. This important threat is
examined in detail below for longitudinal studies.
4. Misspecified variances: The significance of statistical tests is overstated if outcomes for some
individuals are correlated or clustered, so the data have a group structure [64]. A number of treatments
for clustered standard errors are now available.
5. Omitted interactions and paths: Omitted variables that capture differential effects by group, such
as males and females, and omitted relationships that reflect more complex causal orders. As explained
below, the terms for these influences in psychology are moderated and mediated effects.
6. Endogeneity: This term refers to the joint determination of outcomes. For example, many
longitudinal studies determine youths` baseline ownership of alcohol- or cigarette-branded
merchandise and then measure the effect of baseline ownership on drinking or smoking outcomes at
follow-up. After controlling for confounders, a significant positive relationship between ownership and
outcomes is given a causal interpretation. However, in contrast to true experiments, ownership of the
merchandise--or other exposure to advertising--is not randomly assigned, rather it is a choice on the
part of the respondent. Hence, there is a strong possibility that ownership is endogenous, which
requires a stochastic examination, and not predetermined or assigned in the experimental sense. As
explained below, modeling of simultaneity is a common task in econometric studies, but this step is
ignored in the longitudinal literature on youth drinking and smoking. As a result, empirical results in
longitudinal studies are suspect due to simultaneity bias. Note that simultaneity is not an economic or
econometric feature of the data; rather it arises due to use of a non-experimental research design. Its
detection and measurement is critical to the internal validity of quasi-experimental research designs.
7. Selection bias: Selection can take many forms. For example, self-selection occurs if respondents
can opt out of the survey and their participation decision is based on characteristics that also are
relevant to drinking or smoking outcomes, but are unobserved. As shown by Heckman [68], self
selection creates specification bias for the empirical relationship. The crucial detail is that the sample is
no longer random and there are omitted variables associated with the participation decision.
8. Sample attrition: The differential loss of participants from different groups, such as the failure of
minority students to participate in the follow-up survey at a rate comparable to non-minority students.
Both selection and attrition threats are discussed in detail below.
With the exception of endogeneity, all of the threats to internal validity are well-known statistical
problems in the psychology and public health literatures, although individual studies may fail to fully
recognize or deal with some threats. It is a special feature of many econometric studies that they
grapple with endogeneity issues, where several statistical techniques are available. In the remainder of
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 879
this review, the threats are taken up in conventional order, but readers with a strong background in
econometrics might desire to read Section 5 prior to the rest of the review. Many details are examined
for model specification and measurement, but it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the single-most
important contribution of health econometrics is its focus on endogeneity issues.
4. Specification and Estimation of Longitudinal Models: Alcohol and Tobacco
4.1. Model Specification: Specification Bias and Measurement Errors
This section reviews the model specification used in 20 longitudinal studies of youth drinking and
26 studies of youth smoking. Overall, there are a number of common features of the studies, which
allow cross-study comparisons and generalizations. However, the two groups of studies employ
slightly different models, especially for advertising receptivity and exposure. I first examine the model
specifications used in studies of youth alcohol behavior and summarize the difficulties associated with
the measures of advertising in these studies, especially the consistency of empirical results across
studies. Second, I examine the model specifications used in studies of youth smoking behavior, and
offer critical assessments of these studies. In both cases, there are numerous empirical estimates that
are null or statistically insignificant that tend to be ignored in other reviews and policy discussions.
Specification errors arise when an empirical model omits a relevant covariate (omitted variable bias)
or when an empirical model includes an irrelevant variable [69]. In the first instance of
under-specification, the least-squares estimator of the remaining variable(s) is biased, with the
direction of bias depending on the correlation between the omitted variable and the included variable
and the correct sign of the omitted variable on the outcome in question. Suppose risk-preferences of
survey respondents are positively correlated with receptivity to marketing, and risk-preference has a
positive effect on drinking and smoking behaviors. If risk-preference is omitted as a covariate or
unobserved, a positive correlation and a positive (but omitted) sign impart a positive bias to the
receptivity variable [70]. The measured effect of marketing is overstated. The size of the bias is
determined by the effect size of the omitted variable (risk) and the partial effect of risk on receptivity,
i.e., the risk-adjusted effect of receptivity. Hence, it is crucial in an empirical study that all important
variables are included, especially those that are more highly correlated with the explanatory variable
that is the focus of the investigation. Potentially, this list of variables is quite long. In a multivariate
context, the bias can be transferred to other covariates depending on the pattern of correlations among
the included variables. Only in the unlikely case where all covariates are uncorrelated (orthogonal
regressors) is the bias avoided. The variance-covariance matrix for the included variables is unbiased,
but larger in magnitude (less efficient). Further, including an irrelevant variable does not result in bias
for the other variables, although the least-squares estimator is not as efficient. Because there is always
uncertainty regarding the correct model specification, a number of statistical tests and diagnostics
have been developed, including tests for omitted variables, functional form, structural change, and data
outliers [69,70]. More generally, it is common practice in econometrics to present results for several
different specifications or estimation methods, which tests less formally the robustness of the results
for omitted variables [69]. This is referred to as a robustness check or sensitivity analysis. As
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 880
discussed below, both formal and informal specification tests are rarely conducted in
longitudinal studies.
The second problem discussed in this section is measurement error associated with variables for
advertising receptivity and exposure (errors-in-variable problem). Ideally, an advertising or marketing
measure should satisfy three criteria. First, it should represent accurately the forces that influence a
decision by a youth to consume alcohol or tobacco, insofar as these decisions are affected by
advertising and marketing. Second, all relevant advertising and marketing variables are included in the
final regression (otherwise there is specification bias). Third, the advertising variables in the model
should be related in some manner to actual or anticipated public policies, such as broadcast advertising
bans or restrictions on the contents of advertisements and promotions. In the first instance,
mismeasuring the advertising variable renders this explanatory variable stochastic and hence correlated
with the error term in the regression. The least-squares estimator of the advertising coefficient is biased
and inconsistent, i.e., the problem is not solved by increasing the sample size [69]. In general, the bias
is toward zero, with the magnitude of the bias depending on the how much variation there is in the true
variable measured without bias and the variation in the measurement error [70]. In the multivariate
case, estimators of all included variables can be biased and inconsistent. However, the direction of the
bias can go either way and is generally difficult to determine. Econometric procedures for dealing with
errors-in-variable bias include use of instrumental variables, but traditional methods applied to survey
data present special problems [71]. Latent variable models have been widely used in health
economics [72], with several indicator variables that are related linearly to unobserved true values of
the mismeasured variable. However, instrumental variable estimation is a special case, which avoids
strong assumptions regarding measurement error variances [69].
In addition to measurement and specification errors, many of the receptivity-exposure measures
present special problems for assessment of public policies toward alcohol and tobacco advertising.
Most measures in question are not demonstrated to be related to or even correlated with actual
advertising exposure or with any actual public policy [73]. This is in sharp contrast to econometric
studies that attempt in various ways to evaluate the effects of advertising expenditures, broadcast
advertising bans, and other regulatory policies (e.g., price advertising bans, billboard bans, warning
labels). Because the receptivity measures in longitudinal studies tend to be broad and amorphous, it is
difficult to say (or even guess) how receptivity might change in light of a particular public policy.
Hence, as a crude policy application, longitudinal studies usually are led to recommend complete bans
of all forms of alcohol and tobacco advertising, but this is not a statistical application or even logical
extension of the models. It is not possible to simulate the consequences of the proposal to see if the
estimated results are reasonable. As a result of these problems, most longitudinal studies are devoid of
policy implications as that term is commonly understood by economists.
A final issue here concerns the nomenclature applied to the right-hand side (RHS) of regression
equations. In econometrics, RHS variables (the X variables) are usually referred to as regressors,
covariates, independent variables, or explanatory variables. The outcome or response is the regressand
or dependent variable (the LHS y variable). Other disciplines frequently employ the term
confounders or extraneous variables to refer to RHS variables other than the variable(s) that are
the focus of the study. However, in psychology, an important distinction also is drawn between RHS
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 881
variables that are moderators and mediators of a focus variable [74]. Briefly, a moderator variable is
third variable (z) that interacts with a variable x so as to affect the relationship of x and y. This
moderating effect can be accounted for by including z in the regression and an interaction term
between x and z, given by the variable xz. The relationship between x and y now depends on the level
of z. Hence, excluding the interaction variable from the regression is a specification error and could
result in specification bias of some magnitude. Since multicollinearity also is an issue here, tests for
statistical significance generally require examining the joint significance of the coefficients for x, z,
and xz. In econometrics, moderating effects are accounted for in the same fashion or by choice of
functional form for the regression (double-log, semi-log, translog). A mediator variable is a variable
that both causes y and is caused by x, so in a path analysis diagram there is direct path from x to y and
an indirect or intervening path through which x causes z and z causes y. Note that the mediated
relationship is theoretical as opposed to a moderating relationship, which can be treated as a purely
statistical problem. Mediating variables are not usually considered as endogenous variables in the
psychology literature. As long as the indirect relationship or amount of mediation between x and z is
not of major importance, then estimation by multivariate least-squares is straightforward. However,
this precludes a complete causal or structural interpretation, which requires estimation by path analysis
or similar models. Several of the studies reviewed below report results for interaction variables or use
multilevel hierarchical or path analysis models for mediation effects. Complete examination of these
models is beyond the scope of this review, although some critical comments have been offered
elsewhere [40,51].
4.2. Alcohol Advertising: Model Specification in Twenty Studies
Twenty studies were determined to meet the following criteria: (1) a longitudinal study with
baseline and follow-up sample(s) of youth or young adults; (2) one or more drinking behaviors as
outcomes (drinking onset, frequency, binge drinking, etc.); (3) one or more advertising, marketing,
promotional, brand recognition or receptivity measures as covariates, determined at baseline (one
exception); and (4) the study uses a multivariate statistical procedure such as logistic regressions. Some
studies noted below use the same sample of respondents, but analyze the data in different ways. For the
most part, the studies were identified by using previous surveys and searches on MEDLINE, PsycINFO
or Google, and reference lists in more recent publications. Experimental, cross-sectional, and
time-series or econometric studies are excluded from this review. Also excluded are studies of drinking
intentions. Three previous reviews covered 16, 9 and 10 studies, respectively [48-50].
The 20 studies are summarized in the Appendix [75-94]. Fourteen of the studies are for the US,
including four nationwide studies. The other countries studied are Belgium (1 study), Germany (2), and
New Zealand (3). Some studies use several waves of a continuing survey, such as the New Zealand
studies. Some studies use identical or very similar samples: there are two identical nationwide US
studies [85,92]; two studies of South Dakota middle school students [77,79]; two studies of middle
school students in New Hampshire and Vermont [84,88]; and two studies of German youth [81,82]. A
common theme in these overlapping studies is emphasis on different methods of alcohol advertising
and marketing. For example, McClure et al. [84] use the New Hampshire-Vermont sample to study the
effect of alcohol-branded merchandise on drinking onset of youth who were baseline nondrinkers. The
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 882
same sample and drinking outcome is used by Sargent et al. [88] to examine the effect of exposure to
alcohol portrayals in movies. Neither study mentions or includes the data on the other promotional
method. Both models are therefore misspecified and potentially biased. This statement also applies to
other overlapping studies. The age range for respondents in the studies includes youth who generally
are 16 years or younger, but several studies also include young adults [75,76,89]. In some cases, the
empirical analysis is conducted using subsamples by age or gender [75,78,80,89]. Although attrition
and completion rates in the surveys are difficult to determine exactly, most of the surveys indicate a
completion rate from baseline to follow-up of about 70% or better. The exception is the survey used by
Snyder et al. [89], which had sample sizes in four waves of 1,872, 1,173, 787, and 588 respondents.
Multiple outcome measures are reported including drinking onset by baseline nondrinkers, any
alcohol use, average amount per occasion, frequency of consumption, binge drinking, and other
measures such as maximum amount. A difficulty here is that drinking onset tends to cover any use,
which does not necessarily imply continued or frequent use of alcohol. The same problem applies to
current or regular drinking as an outcome, usually defined as any alcohol use in the 30 days prior to
the survey. All outcome measures rely on self-reports by the respondents, but it is difficult to determine
if any cross-checks are included in the survey questions. The studies cover a range of outcomes and use
different statistical models, which makes quantitative summaries more difficult to achieve. The
exceptions are those studies that examine drinking onset and behaviors by baseline nondrinkers and
employ logistic (or log-link) regression models.
In order to isolate the effects of alcohol advertising and promotion on youth drinking behaviors, it is
necessary to control for important covariates or confounders. Lists of included covariates are reported
in the last column of the Appendix table. Substantial diversity is revealed in the lists. In many cases,
social learning theory is cited as a basis for the model specification for advertising, but there is little
discussion of the important covariates that permit a valid test of the effect of advertising in this theory.
Most model specifications are rather ad hoc, and are not guided by a well-defined theoretical model. A
few studies are unclear as to the final list of covariates [90,93]. Some studies include only a few basic
demographics [76,77,87,91] or exclude important variables such as parental or peer
drinking [75,76,78,86-89,91,93]. Measures of risk-taking or impulsiveness are included in some
studies, but this is far from universal [77,79,81,83-86,88,92]. Smoking status is a covariate in five
studies [80,81,84,88,91]. Interaction variables for moderating effects are employed in only three
studies [80,86,90], while four studies estimate structural models [76,81,92,94].
What is required in order for the studies to pass an internal validity test? First, the studies need a
better rationale for the model specification. A starting point is provided by Ellickson et al. [79], where
15 covariates are divided into several broad categories, including social influences (e.g., peer drinking),
social bonds (religiosity, parental monitoring), attitudes and behavior (impulsivity), and demographics
(gender, etc.). In Henriksen et al. [83], the categories are social influences (peer drinking),
psychosocial risk factors (school performance), and demographics. Classifications such as these serve
to indicate the presence or absence of important explanatory variables and facilitate comparisons across
studies. Consulting other surveys in this area would be helpful, such as the review of familial
influences by Avenevoli and Merikangas [95]. Second, more extensive testing of model specifications
should be carried out in the form of a robustness check or sensitivity analysis. This is a standard
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 883
practice in econometrics, but almost never included (or reported) in longitudinal studies. Formal
methods of model specification such as Hendry`s general-to-specific procedures should be
considered [96]. Correlations or variance inflation factors among the covariates are seldom reported to
see if there is extensive duplication of information due to multicollinearity. Full reporting of empirical
results also is encouraged as some studies lack p-values (or standard errors) or fail to report coefficient
estimates for all covariates [78,81,83,85-87,90,93].
Third, some studies use more than one market area and need to consider the inclusion of
market-area variables, such as beverage prices, regulations, average income, and other aggregate
variables. This is standard practice in econometric studies, including those based on survey data such
as Markowitz and Grossman [97] for alcohol regulation and Czart et al. [98] for smoking regulation.
Two nationwide longitudinal alcohol studies for the US use samples of over 6500 youth [85,92], but
neither includes location-specific variables that might be important for youthful decisions. Other
studies use multiple market areas [89] or cover broader geographic regions [77,79,81,82,84,88,91],
which also might require additional data. Aggregate variables also may be required for studies in which
the follow-up survey is more than three years after the baseline survey, such as Casswell et al. [75].
The necessity of controlling for the market environment does not seem to have been considered by
survey researchers. The importance of prices for youthful drinking and smoking speaks against this
omission in survey studies. This issue is discussed further in Section 6.
4.3. Alcohol Advertising Studies: Measures of Advertising and Promotion
The information in the Appendix table reveals a wide variety of measures of advertising and other
forms of promotion for alcohol. A diverse set of empirical results also is revealed. Upon close
examination, there are studies with negative, null, and positive results for advertisements, sometimes in
the same study [75,79,87,90]. Results for some variables, such as TV exposure and other mass media,
are especially fragile. In Table 2, I first provide a narrative summary of the advertising measures,
making note of the range of measures, studies that restrict the variables to one or two covariates, and
other specification and measurement errors. Second, I provide a quantitative summary of the results for
a selected group of 12 studies that estimate a logistic (or log-link) model.

Own or willing to use an alcohol-branded item [77,80,84,85]
Movie exposure & video portrayals of alcohol [81,82,88,92,94]
There are several critical points to make about this information. First, there is little replication of
measures across studies, making assessment more difficult. For example, six studies use general TV
viewing habits as a covariate, but this is unrelated to exposure to alcohol ads and might be a surrogate
for personality traits. Four studies use ownership of an alcohol-branded item (ABI) as a covariate and
five studies use movie portrayals of alcohol. However, there is overlapping information in the sets of
studies. Two German studies [81,82] use the same sample to examine two different measures of movie
exposure. McClure et al. [84] and Sargent et al. [88] use the same New England sample to study the
effects of ABIs and movies, respectively. McClure et al. [85] and Wills et al. [92] use the same
nationwide US sample to study ABIs and movies, respectively. Hence there is less independent
information than might be apparent from Table 2. Further, these studies are misspecified due to the
omission of the other promotion variables; that is, there is no statistical rationale for regressing alcohol
outcomes on ABIs in one study and omitting it as a covariate in a related study of movie exposure. In
general, this will bias the advertising coefficient in each study toward a larger positive value. The same
critical comments apply to other overlapping studies, including the studies by Collins et al. [77] and
Ellickson et al. [79] for South Dakota students.
Second, given the variety of advertising measures in Table 2, it is difficult to understand why so
many studies severely restrict the number of measures or fail to validate the measures with more
complete models. A few studies experiment with general indexes such as advertising receptivity and
liking/awareness of ads and brands. For example, in Henriksen et al. [83], a composite index of
receptivity to alcohol marketing is based on survey responses for: (1) having a favorite alcohol
advertisement; and (2) owning or wanting to own alcohol promotion items. Based on responses,
individuals are divided into minimal, moderate, and high receptivity groups. Henriksen et al. [83] find
statistical associations between high receptivity and drinking onset and current drinking, but the model
is poorly specified and receptivity is not a robust variable. As pointed out by Heckman [73], it is
important to control for all other plausible factors in order to establish a causal relationship, but
Henriksen et al. [83] exclude all familial variables. Further, it is possible that marketing receptivity is
capturing unobserved attitudes and preferences toward drinking. That is, survey respondents who are
more likely to drink would be more likely to be classified as high-receptivity individuals, all other
things held equal. Henriksen et al. [83] provide evidence that alcohol-marketing receptivity is
positively associated with variables for individual risk-taking, lower grades, perceived prevalence, and
perceived approval. Hence, high receptivity may simply be capturing these and other underlying
attitudes and preferences. A plausible conclusion in this and other longitudinal studies is that
adolescents with a greater preference for risk or higher perceptions of drinking prevalence/approval are
more likely to drink. In McClure et al. [85], ownership of an ABI is positively associated with
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 885
variables for sensation-seeking, rebelliousness, and peer drinking. Including an interaction variable
between these preference variables and ABI ownership would be useful to determine if the effect of
ABI-ownership is greater for certain groups of youth. Only a few of the 20 studies have experimented
with interaction effects [80,86,90]. Similar comments apply to studies that measure liking of ads.
Third, evidence on brand recognition or brand approval is not clear evidence regarding the general
effects of advertising-marketing on youth drinking behaviors or evidence of a causal effect of
advertising on youthful drinking. It is not surprising that youth (as well as adults) have a favorite brand
or are able to recognize brands in favorite advertisements. There are informational advantages to new
consumers to associate their consumption with a well-known brand, so economic incentives work in
favor of choosing a brand, especially a well-known brand. Well-known brands also tend to be highly
advertised. However, brand-related variables do not provide convincing evidence of a causal link with
youthful choices. It would not be surprising that individuals who watch lots of broadcasts of
professional football or auto racing also own more branded merchandise related to those sports. It is
not logical to argue that ownership of the merchandise caused them to watch the broadcasts or express
loyalty for a particular team. Brand loyalty is different than a causal effect of advertising.
Given these shortcomings, a final issue is to examine the studies for consistency of empirical
results, which is a simple test of external validity. Table 3 presents a summary of the results for 12
studies that use a logistic or log-link model, which draws on my comprehensive meta-analysis of
longitudinal studies [51]. Results are summarized for the odds ratio for advertising-marketing variables
for drinking onset and other drinking behaviors (frequency, amount, binge drinking, etc.). Advertising
and marketing variables can be divided into four categories: (1) mass media (TV, magazines,
billboards, etc.); (2) promotion portrayals (ABIs, movies, videos); (3) other media exposures (in-store
displays, concessions); and (4) attitudinal or subjective measures (liking of ads, brand recall, etc.). In
Nelson [51], I demonstrate that publication bias is a substantial problem in longitudinal studies, which
is ignored by prior systematic surveys [48-50]. Publication bias occurs when the publication of
empirical results depend on the direction, significance, and magnitude of the results [99,100]. Due to
emphasis on statistical significance, published studies are likely to be skewed toward larger effects. As
a consequence, the published studies comprise a biased sample, so the results of a literature review or
meta-analysis can be misleading. Hence, it is important to take note of insignificant results in
longitudinal studies of advertising and youth alcohol behaviors.
In Table 3, there are 63 estimates of the effects of advertising and promotion on adolescent drinking.
A variety of drinking behaviors are examined, including onset of drinking, maintenance by baseline
drinkers, drinking amounts by beverage, frequency, and binge drinking. Only 21 of 63 estimates (33%)
are statistically significant at the standard 95% confidence level. This does not support
recommendations for bans of advertising. For drinking onset, only one estimate for mass media is
statistically significant. For other drinking behaviors, only 5 of 14 estimates for mass media are
statistically significant, but 4 of these estimates are from the same study by Stacy et al. for Los Angeles
youth [90]. Ten of 15 estimates for promotional portrayals, including ABIs and movies, are significant,
but several z-statistics are close to the lower limit of 2.0. The distribution is right-skewed and several
studies produce point estimates that are outliers (more than two standard deviations above the mean),
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 886
especially the estimates for movie displays in [81] and [82]. Several estimates for ABIs in [77,80,85]
are close to this cutoff.
Finally, in Table 3, there are 18 estimates of the effect of TV viewing on drinking onset and
drinking behaviors, which are significant in 7 cases and insignificant in 11 cases. Both estimates for
magazines are insignificant. There are 10 estimates for ABIs, 6 of which are significant and 4 are
insignificant. A similar problem exists for studies of movie displays. Except for one estimate for
in-store displays, none of the 10 estimates for other promotions are significant. There are 8 estimates
for subjective liking of ads, awareness of ads and self-reported ad exposure. Only one estimate is
statistically significant. None of the 7 estimates for brand awareness are statistically significant. These
results raise questions of what exactly is being captured by more objective measures of marketing
exposure. One possibility is that youth who are predisposed to drink for unobserved reasons also are
attracted to advertising and promotion of alcohol. This means generally that the models used in
longitudinal studies should treat measures of advertising and marketing as endogenous variables, and
not predetermined or exogenous variables. This issue is addressed below.

4.4. Tobacco Advertising: Model Specification in Twenty-Six Studies
Twenty-six tobacco studies were determined to meet the following criteria: (1) a longitudinal study
with baseline and follow-up sample(s) of youth; (2) one or more smoking behaviors as outcomes
(smoking susceptibility, onset, regular smoker, etc.); (3) one or more advertising, marketing,
promotional, brand recognition or receptivity measures as covariates, determined at baseline (one
exception); and (4) the study uses a multivariate statistical procedure such as logistic regressions (one
exception). Excluded are longitudinal studies that use descriptive methods for analysis or which
examine smoking intentions, anti-smoking media campaigns, young adults exclusively, or smoking
regulations. Some studies noted below use the same sample of respondents, but analyze the data in
different ways. For the most part, the studies were identified by using previous surveys and searches
on MEDLINE, PsycINFO or Google, and reference lists in more recent publications. Experimental,
cross-sectional, and time-series or econometric studies are excluded from this review. Three previous
systematic reviews of longitudinal studies covered 16, 9, and 13 studies, respectively [32,42,101].
The 26 studies are summarized in the Appendix [81,102-126]. Nineteen studies are for the US,
including two nationwide studies. The other countries studied are Australia (2 studies), Germany (2),
Mexico (1), Spain (1), and the United Kingdom (1). Some studies use several waves of a continuing
survey, such as the studies using the California Tobacco Survey (CTS). Some studies use identical or
very similar samples: there are three studies for Massachusetts [104,105,117]; two studies for
California for 1993­1996 [107,114]; three studies for California for 1996-1999 [109,115,116]; two
studies for New Hampshire and Vermont [108,120]; and two studies for Germany [81,122]. Common
themes in these overlapping studies are emphasis on different tobacco advertising methods or different
smoking outcomes. For example, Pierce et al. [116] use the 1996-1999 CTS to examine the effect of
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 889
advertising receptivity on smoking susceptibility, controlling for the covariate curiosity about
smoking. Virtually the same sample is used by Distefan et al. [109] to examine the effects of smoking
by a favorite movie star on smoking onset, but curiosity is omitted as a covariate. The use of
overlapping samples means the amount of independent information in the table is less than what is
apparent. In some cases, the empirical analysis is conducted using subsamples by age, gender, race,
country of birth, and parenting style [106,111,112,115,125]. These studies suggest that heterogeneity of
respondents is very important for measuring the influence of advertising on smoking behaviors. Across
the 26 studies, the range of ages for respondents at baseline is about 10­15 years (grades 6­9), but one
study [111] includes older respondents and one [123] uses younger respondents. Attrition and
completion rates in the surveys are difficult to determine exactly, but most of the surveys indicate a
completion rate from baseline to follow-up of about 65%. In several of the CTS studies, the rate is
below 50% [107,111]. One study [106] had a completion rate of 100% but the surveys are separated by
only four months, suggesting this study might be better treated as a cross-sectional study. Several
studies use surveys separated by 4 to 6 years, which raises issues of confounding due to trend effects.
The outcome measures in the studies include regular smoking, onset of smoking, experimenting
with smoking, susceptibility to smoking, and a smoking index. A few studies use two or more
outcomes [117,123,126]. Except for regular smoking and experimentation, these measures present
interpretation problems. Onset measures combine experimenters, occasional smokers, and regular
smokers, while susceptibility measures combine susceptible nonsmokers with experimenters and
(possibly) regular smokers. The ordinal smoking indexes combine all individuals from
non-susceptibiles to regular smokers, but it is unclear if a linear scale is appropriate for this task. It is
sometimes argued that using smoking susceptibility as an outcome is a more sensitive measure than
actual smoking [119], but this ignores the possibility that the two groups (susceptibiles and smokers)
might have fundamentally different responses to advertising stimuli. Unfortunately, this issue has not
been addressed within the confines of a single sample of respondents.
In order to accurately isolate the effects of tobacco advertising and promotion on youth smoking
behaviors, it is necessary to control for important covariates or confounders. Lists of included
covariates are reported in the last column of the Appendix table. Substantial diversity is revealed in the
lists. Most studies include basic demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity) and most
studies include variables for parental and peer smoking, but there are exceptions [111,117,119].
Measures of risk-taking or impulsiveness are included in some, but not all,
studies [81,104,108,112,120,121]. A number of studies include interaction variables that test for
moderator effects, with mixed results [102,107-109,111,113-116,119,122,125]. Some studies, such as
Biener and Siegel [104], use simple bivariate regressions to select the variables in their final model, but
fail to consider interactions between, say, receptivity and parental smoking and fail to examine
multicollinearity issues. Several studies test for mediation effects by using multilevel, path analysis or
other structural equation models [81,105,119-121], but these studies treat advertising as an exogenous
variable and do not test for possible endogeneity (see below). In a number of cases, full results for
covariates are not reported [81,102-104,108,110,113,115,117,118,126]. In Pierce et al. [116], the
variable for curiosity about smoking is included as a possible covariate for experimentation and
susceptibility to smoking. Past curiosity about smoking at baseline is a strong predictor of
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 890
experimentation and susceptibility at follow-up. However, including curiosity as a regressor leads to
insignificant results for receptivity to tobacco advertising in both regressions. This raises an important
issue of omitted variable bias in other studies, since this is the only study that considers curiosity as an
intermediate goal of advertising. Pierce et al. [116] argue that curiosity appears to be an antecedent to
susceptibility to smoking, but it is unclear why only higher levels of receptivity are associated with
curiosity in a cross-sectional regression. As discussed below, curiosity as a personality trait could be
used to construct an instrumental variable estimate of the advertising-marketing covariate [64,127].
What is required in order for the studies to pass an internal validity test? In many cases, social
learning theory is cited as a basis for the model specification for advertising, but there is little
discussion of the important covariates that permit a valid test of the effects of advertising in this theory.
Most model specifications are rather ad hoc, and are not guided by a well-defined theoretical model.
First, the studies need a better rationale for model specification. Several studies provide categorical
summaries of the covariates, such as that in Alexander et al. [102] where variables are classified
according to attitudes, knowledge, social and personal factors and usage of other drugs. For
most part, longitudinal studies simply present a list of covariates with little justification, although
sometimes there is a supporting cross-sectional study that delves into the specifics of the survey
instrument and sampling procedures [108,128]. Second, more extensive testing of model specification
should be carried out in the form of a robustness check or sensitivity analysis (see above on alcohol
studies). Third, some studies use multiarea samples, such as two nationwide surveys for the
US [110,121]. More generally, all of the tobacco studies employ broad geographic areas, where prices,
economic conditions, smoking regulations, health information and costs, and other variables can differ
across jurisdictions. Studies for states as large as California, Massachusetts, and North Carolina need to
consider including variables that control for the market environment as well as the social environment.
This omission is a common theme for all alcohol and tobacco studies. An alternative approach, widely
used in econometrics, is a fixed-effects panel model, with binary indicator variables for schools,
jurisdictions, states, etc. [64,69,70]. Unobserved heterogeneity is captured by the fixed-effect intercept
for each group in the panel. No longitudinal study has incorporated this methodology.
4.5. Tobacco Advertising Studies: Measures of Advertising and Promotion
Reflecting restrictions on tobacco advertising, longitudinal studies have relied on fewer measures of
advertising and promotion compared to similar studies for alcohol. Allowing for multiple measures in
some studies, the Appendix table indicates the following measures have been used: receptivity index,
movie-smoking exposure, general TV viewing, knowledge of brands, approval/favorite cigarette ads,
ownership of a cigarette-branded item, and magazine exposure. None of these measures is validated in
the sense that it is shown to be related to actual advertising campaigns or public regulations that have
affected tobacco advertising. General measures, such as TV viewing, are especially suspect.
Receptivity to tobacco marketing has been used often as an advertising measure, but it is a rather broad
and amorphous index. As originally proposed by Pierce et al. [114], receptivity captures exposure to a
communication and a cognitive response that indicates an understanding of the communication. Survey
respondents are asked three questions in order to determine their position on a receptivity scale, such
as: (1) Do you own or would you be willing to use a cigarette-branded item (CBI), such as a t-shirt?;
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 891
(2) What brand of cigarette was most advertised in ads you have recently seen on billboards or in
magazines?; and (3) What is the name of the cigarette brand of your favorite advertisement?
Depending on the study, respondents are considered to be highly receptive if the first question is
answered affirmatively; moderately receptive if the third question is answered with a specific brand,
but they answer the first question negatively; and low receptivity if the second question is answered,
but the respondent does not name a favorite ad or own a CBI. Hence, the receptivity index is: minimal
(no brand, no favorite ad, no CBI); low (brand, no favorite ad, no CBI); moderate (brand, favorite ad,
no CBI); and high receptivity (willing/has CBI).
There are several things to note critically about receptivity indexes. First, receptivity is largely about
brand recognition and not about exposure to different levels of advertising. Hence, it is possible that
receptivity merely tests the weak theory of advertising or demonstrates that advertised brands are
recognized by smokers. No causal interpretation should be assigned to this relationship. Second,
receptivity measures have not been validated by showing they measure exposure to actual cigarette
advertising campaigns. The terminology used in longitudinal studies confuses personal preferences
with advertising exposure [73]. Third, respondents with high receptivity may differ in important but
unobservable ways from those with lower levels of receptivity. It should not be assumed that
respondents who wear a branded t-shirt (or are willing to wear one) are in all ways identical to those
who do not, except for the observable covariates in the regression equation. Fourth, as discussed
below, receptivity and indeed all measures of advertising and marketing involve choices on the part of
the respondent. Each respondent chooses to own or not own a CBI. Each respondent chooses to view
more or fewer R-rated movies. The choice process is fundamental to testing of theoretical models of
the effects of advertising and marketing on youthful behaviors regarding alcohol and tobacco.
Longitudinal studies in psychology and public health ignore this part of the problem and treat
receptivity as a purely exogenous treatment, and thereby seek to estimate a dose-response
relationship. The level of dosage is not randomly assigned to each respondent, but is rather chosen by
the respondent. Hence, in order to demonstrate causality, a detailed model of the choice process and the
accompanying incentive structure must be sought [73].
Given these shortcomings, the final issue is to examine the studies for consistency of empirical
results. Table 4 presents a summary for 18 studies that use a logistic or log-link model. Results are
summarized for the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for groups of studies by outcome: regular
smoker, onset of smoking, experimentation, susceptibility, and smoking indexes. Overall, there are 63
empirical results reported in Table 4, which are insignificant in 32 cases (51%). Low receptivity is
insignificant in 6 of 6 cases and moderate receptivity is insignificant in 7 of 10 cases. High receptivity
is insignificant in 3 of 10 cases. Overall, receptivity is insignificant in 16 of 26 cases (62%). The lack
of robust results is an indication of theoretical weaknesses or evidence of measurement errors. The
results for high receptivity may reveal only an association between brand loyalty and smoking
behaviors. The results are even poorer for general TV exposure. There are 8 results for TV-viewing,
which are significant in 2 cases and insignificant in 6 others. For movie exposure, the results are
insignificant in 8 of 22 cases. The distribution is right-skewed and some coefficient estimates are
outliers (i.e., more than two standard deviations above the mean), especially values for TV viewing
in [110]. It might be argued that the evidence is stronger for high levels of receptivity or exposure, but
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 892
it also might be the case that youth who wear cigarette-branded t-shirts, watch lots of TV and videos,
and go to lots of R-rated movies are different in fundamental ways from youth who moderate these
behaviors. Finally, no study includes more than two measures of advertising and marketing, so there is
omitted variable bias in all studies. One study [112] merely reports separate regressions for movies and
TV. Overall, this is a generally weak set of results that fail to support either a causal relationship
between advertising and youth smoking or the implied public policy of advertising bans.

As shown in the Appendix, there are ten longitudinal studies of movie-smoking exposure and youth
smoking behaviors for the United States, Germany, and Mexico [81,108,109,112,120-125]. A review
by Charlesworth and Glantz [129] of the movie-exposure literature argues that there is strong
empirical evidence that smoking in movies increases adolescent smoking initiation (p1516). However,
Omidvari et al. [130] point out that smoking prevalence in US movies is no more common than in real
life (23.2% vs. 24.8%, respectively). They reviewed 447 movies that depicted contemporary American
life in the 1990s (R-rated, 193; PG13-rated, 131; and PG-rated, 123). The movies are chosen from the
top 10 movies on the weekly box office charts, so they are in general popular films that are seen by
many viewers. Overall, the depiction of smoking in movies is more prevalent for men, antagonistic
characters (bad guys and villains), lower socioeconomic class (SEC) characters, whites compared
to non-whites, independent movies rather than studio films, and R-rated movies. In particular, smoking
prevalence in R-rated movies is higher than the general US population for both studio films (30.5%)
and independent productions (50.6%). The majority of R-rated films portray smokers as white males,
lower-middle SEC, and antagonists. Much has been written negatively about product placement of
cigarettes in cinema. Omidvari et al. [130] point out that, contrary to previous reports, if there is a
conscious attempt to influence public smoking habits, it is being orchestrated by independent movies,
and not by Hollywood (p751). These conclusions are not unexpected. Independent producers
(entrants) must differentiate themselves from established producers (incumbents) by making more
anti-establishment films that appeal to particular tastes and preferences. Thus, scientific evidence on
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 896
movie portrayals of smoking points to unobserved tastes and preferences as a motivator of adolescent
choices related to movie viewing. This issue deserves greater attention in longitudinal studies.
5. Endogenous Regressors, Sample Selection Bias, and Unobserved Heterogeneity
The analysis in this section concerns estimation and sampling issues that heretofore have not been
considered by researchers that estimate longitudinal models of youth drinking and smoking. Previous
articles by Geweke and Martin [131], Heckman [73], and Heckman et al. [132] provide insightful
discussions of endogeneity and sample selection for a limited number of early smoking
studies [104,107,114,118], but the analytical issues also are relevant to drinking studies and more
recent smoking studies. To the best of my knowledge, the analysis in these articles has escaped the
attention of public health researchers. It is useful to begin with an intuitive discussion of the problems
before turning to evidence from the longitudinal studies.
Consider a sample of youth where a portion owns an alcohol-branded item (ABI). Suppose the
research problem is to identify the determinates of drinking behavior, conditional on baseline
ownership of an ABI (yes or no) and other covariates for demographics, attitudes toward drinking,
personality traits, social environment, and so forth. The objective is to use the empirical relationship
for the sample to make predictions about the effect of ABI-ownership on drinking behaviors of the
adolescent population. That is, the investigator desires ultimately to predict the effect on drinking from
reducing or eliminating ABIs for the population as a whole. Endogeneity occurs when an independent
variable included in the model is potentially a choice variable or is correlated with unobservables
included in the error term of the regression equation. The problem is illustrated by assuming that each
youth has a baseline endowment of observable and unobservable personal and social characteristics.
Observable characteristics might include age, gender, race/ethnicity, school performance, family
drinking, and peer drinking. Unobservable characteristics might include genetics, risk propensity,
discount rate on future health, feelings of invulnerability, curiosity about drinking, schooling prior to
baseline, attitudes toward authority, crime and other deviance, family health status, family wealth,
social status, legal environment, market prices, and so forth. Note that many of the unobservables may
predate the baseline survey, such as genetic characteristics or early upbringing.
The dependent variable for drinking behavior and the covariate for ABI-ownership are observed for
all youth in the sample. ABI-ownership is endogenous if individuals` decision to acquire an ABI is
correlated with unobservables that affect drinking behavior. For instance, if curiosity affects ownership
and is an omitted covariate in the regression for drinking behavior, then the failure to control for
curiosity will yield a biased estimate for ABI-ownership due to its correlation with the error term. The
bias is positive in this example, so the effect of ABIs on drinking is overstated. The least-squares
estimator is biased and inconsistent (asymptotically biased), so an alternative estimator is often
desirable. It is a characteristic of many econometric studies that investigators attempt to model both the
relationship between the input factors determining the outcome (drinking) and the choices leading to
observation of some of those factors [132]. Examples of potentially endogenous regressors are
ABI-ownership, attendance at R-rated movies, and self-reported exposure to advertising. The
instrumental variable technique is often used for endogenous regressors and is discussed below.
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 897
Selection bias occurs when the dependent variable is only observed for a restricted, non-random
sample. The problem may arise due to non-participation (refusals) during the baseline survey or from
attrition (drop-outs) during the follow-up survey. At both points in time, individuals decide whether
to participate or not, so there is self-selection in the sample used in the analysis. In his seminal article
on this problem, Heckman [68] demonstrated that bias is created because fitted regression functions
confound the behavioral parameters of interest with parameters of the function determining the
probability of entrance into [or exit from] the sample (p154). Selection bias also may arise if the
investigator decides to screen the data in various ways, such as pre-screening of survey participants,
favoring longer time intervals over shorter intervals, or arbitrarily discarding observations with missing
data. Selection by investigators also can lead to a non-random sample.
Suppose that owners and non-owners of ABIs are chosen randomly from the population and have
similar endowments of observable and unobservable characteristics. A randomly-chosen baseline
sample should have average characteristics for ABI-owners and non-owners that mirror the average
characteristics of the population. However, participation in the surveys is a personal decision, so the
respondents are unlikely to be randomly distributed. Sample selection bias arises when some
component of the participation decision also is relevant to drinking outcomes, but is unobserved [133].
Accounting for observables is reasonably straight-forward, but controlling for unobservables is not.
That is, when the relationship between the survey participation decision and the drinking decision is
purely through observables, appropriate specification of the regression equation will account for
differences among individuals in the sample. Sample selection bias will not arise solely because of
differences in observable characteristics. If the participation decision also depends on unobservables
(curiosity, attitudes toward authority, family wealth, etc.) and these characteristics are correlated with
unobservables affecting respondents` drinking decision, then the model is misspecified. If the analyst
estimates a regression of drinking behavior conditional on only observables, the model fails to account
for an additional process or influence on behavior, namely, the process that determines whether the
respondent participates in the baseline survey or drops-out of the follow-up survey. A bias arises due to
sample self-selection, which is another way of saying the sample is non-random due to behavioral
choices by participants. There are several ways for dealing with selection bias such as insuring high
response rates; conducting a follow-up survey; the Heckman two-stage approach; and other estimation
methods [69,70,131,133]. Finally, it is clear that in longitudinal studies both endogeneity bias and
sample selection bias can be present in the same study.
5.1. Endogeneity Bias in Longitudinal Studies
In econometrics, statistics, and epidemiology, the problem of endogeneity occurs when an
explanatory variable is correlated with the error term in the regression model. This implies that
regression coefficients estimated by ordinary least-squares (OLS) are biased and inconsistent. The
correlation may arise due to omission of a relevant confounding variable (specification bias),
measurement errors in an explanatory variable (errors-in-variable bias), or joint determination of an
explanatory variable with the dependent variable (simultaneity or reverse causality bias). The method
of instrumental variables (IV) is frequently used to deal with issues of endogeneity [64,134]. Briefly, in
the IV model there are one or more variables (the instruments) that affect the endogenous
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 898
explanatory variable, but only impact the dependent variable through the explanatory variable. For
example, suppose that parental political beliefs are correlated with ABI-ownership by a son or
daughter, but are not correlated with the youth`s drinking behavior. In order for political beliefs to be a
valid instrument, the following conditions must hold: (1) the instrument must be correlated with the
endogenous explanatory variable, conditional on other covariates; (2) the instrument cannot be
correlated with the error term in the equation of interest, otherwise it is an invalid instrument; and
(3) the selected instrument should be a strong predictor of the endogenous variable in question,
otherwise the predicted values of the endogenous variable will have too little variation. A weak
instrument is a variable that is weakly correlated with the endogenous explanatory
variable [127,133,134]. For instance, in a study of the effects of smoking on adult physical functional
status (i.e., health), Leigh and Schembri [135] argue that smoking affects health (and vice versa), but
cigarette prices only affect smoking. Hence, they choose price as an instrument in the IV method to
obtain predicted values for smoking for inclusion in the health regression, and report that the true
effect of smoking on health is larger than conventional methods have estimated (p290).
The standard approach to IV estimation--referred to as Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)--is, first,
to regress the endogenous explanatory variable on the instrument(s) and all exogenous covariates (age,
gender, race, school performance, etc.) to obtain predicted values for ABI-ownership. In many cases,
the first-stage regression is of interest in its own right because it explains ownership behavior. Call the
predicted values ABI-hat. Second, regress drinking behavior on ABI-hat and all other exogenous
covariates, which will yield a statistically consistent estimate for ABI-ownership. Depending on the
software used, the correct standard errors in the IV procedure may require additional estimation [64].
Some caution is required if the model is inherently nonlinear [136]. Various statistical tests for
potential endogeneity also are available such as the widely-used test suggested by Hausman [137].
None of the longitudinal studies of youth drinking and smoking seem to have recognized the potential
for endogenous regressors. In particular, all advertising and marketing covariates are treated as
exogenous. Hence, all longitudinal studies are potentially subject to endogeneity bias. However, a few
studies do provide descriptive analyses of the advertising covariate. Note that dealing with endogeneity
also requires addressing the problem of the correct set of covariates for advertising receptivity and
exposure, which is equally troublesome. I briefly summarize the results in two studies of alcohol
behavior and two studies of smoking behavior that describe underlying aspects of the ownership or
exposure decisions, which demonstrate non-random assignment among participants or
potential endogeneity.
McClure et al. [85] study the effect of ABI-ownership on initiation of drinking and binge drinking
in a sample of 6500 adolescents, ages 10­14 years at baseline in 2003. Follow-up surveys were
conducted at 8, 16, and 24 months, and information on ABI-ownership was acquired at 8 months. As
part of the study, they examine the characteristics of adolescents that own ABIs using a multivariate
logistic regression and also report how the ABI was obtained. ABI-ownership is strongly and positively
related to age of respondent, access to alcohol at home, sensation seeking, exposure to alcohol
portrayals in movies, and susceptibility to alcohol use at baseline. Ownership also is positively related
to peer drinking, rebelliousness, extracurricular activities, but not to television viewing, parental
drinking, parenting style, or academic performance. Variables for blacks and Hispanics are negative
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 899
predictors of ownership. All of these variables are treated as exogenous and are covariates in
regressions for initiation of alcohol use and binge drinking. Because ABI-ownership is a behavioral
choice, it is possible it is an endogenous regressor, which imparts bias to the reported coefficient
estimates. In their discussion of the study`s limitations, the authors fail to recognize or comment on
this problem. Sargent et al. [88] study the effect of movie-alcohol use on drinking initiation in a sample
of 550 adolescents, ages 10­14 years at baseline in 1999. The follow-up survey is conducted on
average at 17 months (range 12­26 months) after the baseline survey. As part of the study, they
examine bivariate logistic relationships between movie-alcohol exposure (in hours) and other
covariates in the drinking regression. They report that exposure to movie-alcohol use is significantly
higher in older adolescents; in males; adolescents who smoke; and in those with lower parental
education, poor school performance, lower levels of self-esteem, lower maternal support, and higher
levels of rebelliousness and sensation seeking. All of these variables are treated as exogenous and
included in a logistic regression for drinking onset. Because movie exposure is a behavioral choice, it
is possible it is an endogenous regressor, which imparts bias to the reported coefficient estimates. In
their discussion of the study`s limitations, the authors fail to recognize or comment on this problem.
Because the ownership and exposure measures are shown to be predictable in a reasonable manner, the
partial results in both drinking studies demonstrate that a multicausal model is required to understand
risky behavior by adolescents [132].
Sargent et al. [118] study the effect of CBI-ownership on smoking status (6-point index) in a sample
of 480 adolescents, ages 9­16 years at baseline in 1996. They truncate the sample and exclude
established baseline smokers. Follow-up surveys are conducted in 1997 and 1998. As part of the study,
they examine bivariate logistic relationships between CBI-ownership and other baseline covariates.
Ownership is positively related to male gender, smoking by family and peers, and smoking status at
baseline. In other words, male smokers at baseline are more likely to own or are more willing to use a
CBI, regardless of other characteristics (age, school performance, parental education). No mention is
made in this study of the possibility that CBI-ownership is an endogenous variable. Instead,
Sargent et al. [118] claim that these data provide strong evidence supporting a causal link between
progression of smoking among adolescents and changes in their response to cigarette promotional
items (p326). This conclusion is premature. Wilkinson et al. [125] study the effect of movie-smoking
exposure on smoking experimentation in a sample of 1300 Mexican-heritage adolescents, ages 11­13
years at baseline in 2001. Follow-up surveys were conducted every six months in 2002 and 2003. As
part of the study, they determine participants` level of exposure to movie smoking using 50 box office
hits for the years 1999 to 2004. For each of eleven pairs of covariates, they calculate mean levels of
exposure to smoking in movies and perform statistical tests for significant differences. Based on these
simple comparisons, movie exposure is more prevalent for older adolescents; for males; youth born in
the US; and those exhibiting higher-levels of risk-taking, anxiety, acculturation, school detention, and
parental education. Movie exposure also is higher for baseline experimenters, adolescents with other
smokers in the household, and those respondents who had friends who smoke. The authors fail to
recognize that movie exposure also is a choice variable that might be endogenous in the
smoking regression.
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 900
As noted by Geweke and Martin [131], youth who have strongly favorable attitudes and
preferences toward smoking will plausibly pay more attention to information of various kinds about
cigarettes, are plausibly more likely to convey their preferences through the use of promotional
products, and are plausibly more likely to start smoking at some point (p119). In a similar vein,
Heckman et al. [132] argue that participants who have greater preferences for smoking might seek out
and obtain more tobacco-related items, even if the items have no independent causal effect on their
desire to smoke (p43). Thus, a finding that CBIs or movie-exposure is associated with smoking
behavior does not demonstrate or prove causality. These four examinations of receptivity and exposure
in the smoking and drinking studies are consistent with this behavioral interpretation and inconsistent
with a random assignment of these variables among adolescents. More complex and complete
multicausal models of choice behavior are required if longitudinal researchers desire to better measure
youth preferences for advertising and drinking or smoking outcomes.
5.2. Selection Bias in Longitudinal Studies
Sample selection bias arises when a rule other than random sampling is used to sample from the
underlying population of interest. Distorted or unrepresentative sampling may be present in a study due
to decisions by investigators or more frequently, and subtly, as a result of self-selection decisions on
the part of individuals being surveyed. Adolescents (or their parents) decide whether or not to
participate in a school-based survey or telephone survey. Adolescents (or their parents) decide whether
to participate in one or more follow-up surveys. In his seminal paper, Heckman [68] outlined an
economic model of self-selection and used it to demonstrate that selection bias can be treated as a
specification error that leads to biased estimates in an OLS regression. That is, variables that affect the
participation decision are correlated with unobservables that affect the outcome of interest, such as
adolescents` drinking or smoking behaviors. According to Vella [138], it may be possible to detect
selection bias by studying differences in observables across subsamples. If the subsamples differ
importantly, this may indicate that there are unobservables that are correlated with the observed
outcome variable. Heckman`s solution for dealing with the self-selection problem is a two-stage
model. In brief, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the unobservables by, first, estimating a
regression for participation. That is, use the information on attrition in the follow-up sample and
covariates to estimate a regression in which the binary dependent variable is the participation decision.
The expected values of the errors from the first-stage regression are used to calculate a new variable
(called the inverse Mills ratio). The second-stage regression is for the outcome, but with the addition of
the new variable that corrects for misspecification arising from self-selection by survey participants.
Because Heckman`s procedure has a rather limited structure and is highly parameterized, a number of
other statistical solutions have been proposed [60,61,69,70,138,139].
Are longitudinal survey studies subject to sample selection bias? Three pieces of information can be
presented that pertain to this issue. First, an examination by Geweke and Martin [131] of the CTS
sample used by Pierce et al. [114] to study the influence of advertising receptivity on adolescent
smoking. Second, the information contained in studies that estimate the outcome regression for
important subsamples by age, gender, race, country of origin, and parenting style. Third, information
contained in many longitudinal studies on attrition in the follow-up sample.
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 901
In their critique of longitudinal studies of adolescent smoking, Geweke and Martin [131] obtained
the raw data used by Pierce et al. [114]. They use these data to demonstrate that Pierce`s sample is not
random due to selection bias. Westat Inc., the firm that collected the CTS data on adolescent smoking,
started with a random-digit dial survey for 78,000 randomly-selected telephone numbers for the entire
state of California. Of this number, 44,000 were residential household telephone numbers. From the
household sample, there were 10,000 refusals and 3000 other non-responses. These omitted households
contained an estimated 3006 adolescents eligible for the youth part of the survey. Because Westat
provided information on the broad purpose of the survey, Geweke and Martin [131] argue that it is
plausible that the 22.9% of the random sample of households that refused to complete the screening
interview have attitudes and experiences relating to smoking . . . that are not representative of the
population at large ­ that is, that are not random (p122). In the remaining 31,000 households, there
were 6862 adolescents who were eligible for the youth portion of the survey, but 727 (11%) of these
individuals refused to participate and 604 were unavailable for other reasons. A total of 5,531
interviews were completed for the baseline, but 320 youth (6%) refused to participate in the follow-up
survey, 371 were unavailable for other reasons, and 1464 could not be located. The final sample size
was 3,376, which is only 34.2% of the randomly-selected youth at the start. This is far from the
85-90% that is the target response rate in survey studies and not even close to the 80% rate reported by
Pierce et al. [114]. Two other CTS studies [107,111] also report low completion rates of 47-49%, but
fail to address selection bias in these data. Geweke and Martin [131] then go on to study the probability
of re-interview. Using a logistic regression, they show that re-interview was less likely for older youth,
males, non-whites, less academically inclined, and smokers. They use this information to reject the
hypothesis that the follow-up sample is a random subsample of the baseline sample. Finally, they study
possible reassignments of the excluded respondents on Pierce`s study results. Geweke and
Martin [131] observe that even modest sample selection problems can account for the relationship
between receptivity and smoking progression found in Pierce et al. (p127). They conclude that this
study is so beset by sample selection problems that it cannot be used with any reliability (p129), even
for the limited purpose of descriptive-inferential modeling.
A second piece of information on selection bias is found in studies that estimate subsample
regressions, which tend to demonstrate that empirical results for advertising receptivity and exposure
differ importantly depending on how the data are divided. If the full sample is biased in some manner
toward the subgroup with a stronger response to advertising, the study results will be biased in the
positive direction. The opposite bias is equally likely, but the issue in part is the direction of bias due to
self-selection at baseline, which is not observed or reported in most studies. In alcohol studies, separate
results by gender are reported by Caswell et al. [75] for New Zealand youth. They report that liking of
advertising is marginally significant for males and insignificant for females. Connolly et al. [78] also
studied New Zealand youth using similar survey data. They find that for males and females, none of the
media variables are significant for wine/spirits, but some media variables for beer are significant for
males and some are negative for females. Fisher et al. [80] also divide the sample by gender.
Ownership of an ABI is significant for both males and females and the coefficient magnitudes are
similar. Snyder et al. [89] present results for the full sample (ages 15-26) and for a subsample of
younger participants (ages 15­20). The results for three advertising variables are similar, except that
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 902
advertising exposure within-individuals is not significant in the full sample. Only mean advertising
exposure is marginally significant for both samples, but it is subject to measurement errors. The
subsample results in some studies of adolescent drinking are suggestive of selection bias, but the
evidence is limited to a few simple comparisons. As is common practice in econometrics, it would be
helpful for investigators to provide additional empirical results in the form of a sensitivity analysis for
important subsamples by gender, race/ethnicity, school performance, parental drinking, parenting style,
and so forth.
In smoking studies, Charlton and Blair [106] report results by gender for youth in the UK, ages
12­13 years. The risk of smoking onset is somewhat greater for girls compared to boys. In particular,
ability to name at least one cigarette brand is significant for girls and not for boys. However, having a
favorite cigarette advertisement and watching cigarette-sponsored TV sports programs is insignificant
for both genders. Jackson et al. [112] report separate results for black and white adolescents, ages
12-14 years. After adjusting for covariates, high-exposure to R-rated movies is insignificant for blacks
and significant for whites. However, variables for hours of TV viewing per day and per week are
insignificant for both races. Pierce et al. [115] report separate results for respondents with more- and
less-authoritative parents. Never-smokers at baseline with more-authoritative parents are more likely to
begin smoking if they also had a high-level of receptivity to tobacco advertising and promotion. The
receptivity variables at all levels are insignificant for respondents with less-authoritative parents. These
findings are somewhat surprising and Pierce et al. [115] interpret their results in terms of
communication theory, but ignore the possibility of selection bias. Wilkinson et al. [125] report
separate results by country of origin for a sample of Hispanic adolescents (Mexican born, US born).
Exposure to smoking in movies is significant for Mexican-born youth, although the authors note that
the number of high-exposure youth is small for both subsamples. Overall, the subsample results in
some studies suggest that unobserved influences may create sample selection bias according to gender,
race/ethnicity, curiosity, and parenting style. As a consequence, sensitivity analyses are recommended.
Finally, many longitudinal studies report information on attrition of participants in the baseline
sample, i.e., those respondents who dropped-out of the follow-up sample. In general, the objective of
these analyses is to demonstrate that the drop-outs have characteristics that are broadly representative
of the baseline sample; that is, attrition does not result in a sample that is biased toward a positive
result for the advertising covariate [83,104]. As discussed above, attrition in the follow-up sample is
only part of the problem as baseline refusals also are relevant. Most analyses are rather descriptive or
incomplete. For example, Hanewinkel et al. [81] simply report that sample attrition is higher for
younger participants, males, sensation-seekers, having parents who drink less frequently, less movie
exposure, and other variables. They fail to provide more details regarding the causes or effects of
attrition. A few studies report results from a multivariate analysis. For drinking studies,
Sargent et al. [88] report that attrition is significantly associated with parental education, school
performance, smoking status, and rebelliousness, but the overall explanatory power of the regression is
poor. This may be due to randomness among drop-outs or to unobserved characteristics in the study.
Stacy et al. [90] report the construction of a risk-based propensity score for drop-outs, but many
details are omitted. For smoking studies, Sargent et al. [118] report results from an experiment with
different levels of predicted smoking uptake for the 122 drop-outs in their sample. They conclude that
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 903
their results are not sensitive to increased smoking propensity or higher advertising receptivity among
drop-outs. Titus-Ernstoff et al. [124] report the results of a logistic regression for drop-out status
conditional on all other baseline covariates. Dropping out of the study is associated with
rebelliousness, parental smoking, and lower parental education. Non-whites are somewhat more likely
to drop-out, other things being equal. Overall, the results in some attrition analyses are suggestive of
selection bias according to race, parental drinking, and parental smoking, but these analyses do not
include baseline refusals.
6. Discussion and Alternative Research Designs
A critical assessment of longitudinal studies of youth drinking and smoking reveals a number of
shortcomings and omissions in the study methodologies. These problems mean that the studies do not
demonstrate causality between advertising-marketing exposure and youth drinking and smoking
behaviors. First, specification errors arise when an empirical model omits a relevant covariate or
explanatory variable. Many model specifications are ad hoc and not guided by a well-defined
theoretical model. Greater use of classifications for the explanatory variables would help, but virtually
all studies omit market-area variables such as product prices and regulations. A simple approach is the
inclusion of fixed-effects binary indicator variables, but this may not help if there is interest in the
effect of specific regulations. Some econometric studies reviewed below have included policy indexes
as an alternative to indicator variables. Formal methods for model selection are available, such as
Hendry`s general-to-specific procedure [69,96]. Sensitivity analysis is required to test the robustness of
empirical results, with particular attention to the range of results for the advertising and marketing
variables. Of special importance is the lack of attention to models with several advertising and
marketing variables. Rather than test a general model, investigators have reported separate regressions
for individual marketing variables, either in the same paper or in separate papers using the same data.
This biases the results and overstates any possible effect of advertising on the outcomes.
Second, measurement errors are associated with current use of advertising receptivity and exposure
variables, which creates a bias due to endogeneity. In order to have policy relevance,
receptivity-exposure measures should be related in some fashion to actual advertising campaigns or
public policies affecting advertising and marketing. Most measures are not demonstrated in any
manner to have policy implications, other than the broad policy of total bans of alcohol and tobacco
advertising and promotion. Receptivity measures are rather broad and amorphous, and focused on
brand identification (favorite ad, brand recall, branded merchandise). Brand loyalty is not the same as a
causal effect of advertising on behaviors, but numerous studies draw this connection based on
receptivity and other brand-related variables. As noted by Heckman [73], this confuses personal
preferences with advertising exposure. The results are especially fragile for moderate and low levels of
receptivity, but this raises an issue of measurement error or possibly omitted or mediating variables.
Moderating effects of advertising also deserve greater attention than it has received, with reporting of
full empirical results and standard errors. Given the results assembled to date, there is no clear
evidence of a positive effect of advertising and marketing on alcohol and tobacco outcomes. The
results are particularly fragile for mass-media variables, but even the results for alcohol-branded items
(ABIs), cigarette-branded items (CBIs), and movie-exposure contain inconsistent results. Overall, only
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 904
21 of 63 estimates (33%) for drinking behaviors are statistically significant in Table 3. For smoking
behaviors, only 31 of 63 estimates (49%) are statistically significant in Table 4. Many of the significant
coefficients are for movie-exposure where model misspecification is an important issue. Results for
movie-exposure must be regarded as tentative until more complete models with several advertising
covariates are reported.
Third, the theoretical models that underlie longitudinal studies do not admit the possibility that
advertising receptivity and exposure are determined endogenously. The result is a biased set of
estimates that offer little in the way of causal relationships. Ownership of an ABI or CBI is a
behavioral choice in the same manner as a youth chooses (or refuses) to drink or smoke. Hence, models
of adolescent behaviors must entertain the possibility of a multicausal model, wherein the choice
behaviors affecting advertising receptivity and exposure are modeled as well as the choice behavior for
the outcome in question. Instead, longitudinal studies adopt a simple research design in which the
advertising variable represents an exogenous treatment and the relationship being measured is akin
to a dose-response relationship. The point here is that advertising receptivity and exposure are not
randomly assigned across survey participants, but rather are the outcomes of choice behavior by the
participants. The evidence reviewed from several studies is entirely consistent with a non-random
assignment. In order to be useful for alcohol and tobacco policy, longitudinal studies must consider the
use of instrumental variables in order to control for or rule out underlying preferences as the cause of
alcohol and tobacco behaviors. As noted by Heckman et al. [132], longitudinal studies do not
accurately model human behavior, as these studies ignore how human choice affects the measurement
of both treatment` and outcome . . . [and] not addressing the potential role individual choices have in
shaping the choice or acceptance of a tobacco item or other receptivity measures, which are taken to be
surrogates for advertising in many public health areas, makes cited results unreliable (p43).
Fourth, although longitudinal studies go to great lengths to ensure random samples of participants,
the studies are deficient in attending to issues of sample selection bias, especially bias introduced at the
time of the initial or baseline survey. Participation in the survey is a choice-outcome by adolescents
(and their parents), which under the right circumstances can be observed and modeled. The procedures
used presently to check on attrition bias are too simple and inadequate to deal with the task of detecting
and controlling for self selection. The review in this paper noted three pieces of information that are at
least suggestive of selection bias. First, an examination by Geweke and Martin [131] of the raw CTS
data used in [114] shows that there is substantial non-response at baseline as well as attrition in the
follow-up sample. Possible reassignments of refusals in this study render void the conclusions. Second,
a number of studies offer results for subsamples, which might reveal important differences among
participants that could bias the results or have important policy implications. Results for advertising
and receptivity variables are in some instances quite sensitive to modeling of the subpopulation, which
is a less formal method for detecting selection bias [138,139]. Third, many longitudinal studies report
information on attrition during the follow-up sample, which is generally low and aided in part by the
short-duration from baseline to follow-up. This poses a dilemma for survey studies because choosing a
short duration can restrict the outcome to a group of more receptive individuals who may smoke or
drink for reasons that pre-date the baseline survey. Choosing a longer duration leads to greater attrition
from the baseline sample. For example, in the four-year study by Audrain-McGovern et al. [126], the
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 905
initial population of 9th graders in five northern Virginia high schools was 2,382, but the baseline
sample was only 1,123 students (47%) due to refusals and nonresponses. It is unclear in many
longitudinal studies whether attrition of this magnitude occurs (or matters) since the focus is usually on
only the follow-up sample.
Given the important limitations of longitudinal studies, it is useful to consider alternative
econometric methodologies for determining the effects of advertising and advertising regulation.
Table 5 presents a selected group of nine alcohol studies and nine tobacco studies. The study lists are
not comprehensive, but rather are chosen to illustrate several important analytical points regarding
estimation and policy-related results. First, it is possible to model advertising expenditures or public
policies that affect advertising such that the empirical results have policy implications. The studies in
Table 5 include examinations of advertising expenditures, partial advertising bans, and comprehensive
bans. Many of the studies illustrate quasi-experimental designs. Second, the studies demonstrate the
important role that product prices have for outcomes. The strength of longitudinal studies is that they
focus modeling efforts on a subpopulation of interest, namely adolescents. A major weakness of
longitudinal studies is that they do not model advertising in a useful manner or account for market
variables such as product prices. The studies in Table 5 include four time-series studies for Australia,
Canada, and Sweden [140,141,146,150]; seven cross-sectional studies that use survey data for the
Canada, Sweden, US, and multiple countries [97,98,142,144,147-149]; five panel data studies for US
states and multiple OECD countries [66,143,145,151,152]; and two meta-analyses [51,153]. There are
eight studies in the table that include results for youth [51,98,144,145,147-149,152]. Although two
studies [145,149] report some positive results, the effects of advertising in these studies are modest or
inconsistent across subpopulations [51]. In some cases, regulations have a short-run effect that
dissipates with time [140,150] or there are cross-product compensating effects [143]. These important
modeling considerations are omitted from longitudinal studies.
There are several conclusions to be drawn from Table 5. First, there is no evidence that
higher-frequency data are important. A study using monthly advertising expenditure data fails to reveal
an effect of advertising on alcohol consumption [141]. This replicates the results obtained in numerous
other studies using annual and quarterly data [39,40]. Second, both partial and complete bans of
advertising are ineffective in reducing alcohol or tobacco use for adult and youth populations. In
Paschall et al. [144], a composite alcohol advertising control rating is not statistically significant at
standard confidence levels and hence does not affect alcohol use by youth in 26 developed countries. In
Hublet et al. [148], bans of advertising do not have a significant effect on smoking behaviors of youth
in 29 developed countries. In Nelson [152], partial and complete bans of advertising do not have an
effect on youth smoking in 42 developing countries. Similar results are found in other alcohol and
tobacco studies for partial bans (billboards, window displays, campus bulletin boards, distilled spirits
advertising), more complete bans (bans of broadcast advertising, bans of all media), and other
regulations (warning labels). Third, product price is an important variable that significantly affects
drinking and smoking outcomes. All of the econometric studies in Table 5 that include prices find
significant price elasticities for alcohol and tobacco, including youth behaviors. This variable is
overlooked in social learning theory and omitted in longitudinal studies. Finally, the cumulative
evidence in two meta-analyses [51,153] does not support the use of advertising bans as a means to
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 906
reduce alcohol or tobacco consumption. As noted, this finding applies to youth as well adults. The
summary of findings in Table 5 supports other reviews of advertising for alcohol [39,40] and
tobacco [154,155], which also conclude that advertising bans are ineffective.

country. The results for Sweden are not different
than the other 3 countries, despite the advertising
ban. Price is significant for Sweden.

7. Conclusions and Policy Implications
Longitudinal studies use a quasi-experimental research design, which implies non-randomness in
the assignment of treatment and comparison groups. This design requires attention to a number of
statistical and econometric problems [64]. Overall, the results in the present review fail to agree with
prior results in more limited reviews for alcohol [31,48-50] and tobacco [32,42,101]. My results raise
important issues regarding both internal and external validity threats to research conclusions, which are
largely ignored by longitudinal researchers and public health reviewers. This review has offered a
number of suggestions for improving the research methods used by longitudinal investigators. First,
attention needs to be paid to selecting sets of covariates that provide an adequate test of the underlying
theory, including market-wide variables. Second, several methods of advertising and promotion should
be investigated using the same sample. Many studies investigate only one measure, such as branded
merchandise or movie portrayals. Third, exposure to advertising and marketing needs to be treated as
endogenous variables involving choices on the part of youthful respondents. Given a nonrandom
assignment of advertising among respondents, the instrumental variable technique should be
considered as a means of handling this problem. Fourth, selection bias is an issue in longitudinal
studies since participation is a personal choice on the part of youth and their parents. Failure to deal
adequately with this problem results in a nonrandom sample and biased empirical results. Overall, here
are many areas where improvements are needed and much work to be done if longitudinal studies are
to serve as a bias for public policy.
Advertising of alcohol and tobacco is a major preoccupation of regulators in most developed
countries. This stems from social costs associated with the use of these products and concern for the
health and welfare of adolescents. Youth who engage in risky behaviors may not experience immediate
adverse effects of drinking and smoking, but the choices they face as adults may be adversely restricted
by past adolescent behaviors and outcomes. This creates concerns by public officials and advocacy
groups regarding persuasive advertisements for these products, and the information and images
contained in the ads or other promotions. However, it is important to remember that advertising
regulation is but one of a large number of public policies that can affect alcohol or tobacco use,
including controls on purchase age, possession, physical availability, product strength, warning labels,
server training, education programs, taxation, and advertising content codes. Simultaneous
consideration of a menu of policies should be used to select those tools that are most effective or can
be implemented at a low social cost. Given a policy menu, the important lessons from this review are
that, first, studies using longitudinal surveys have not established that advertising is a causal factor for
youth drinking and smoking and, second, these studies cannot be used to support recommendations for
advertising and marketing bans. My analysis and conclusions support several previous surveys that
examine a menu of public policies available for alcohol regulation [156,157] and tobacco
regulation [158,159], and which reach a similar conclusion regarding the relative importance of
advertising. In conclusion, it would be useful to refocus longitudinal studies on other policy variables
that importantly affect youth alcohol and tobacco behaviors.

Change in smoking
status from baseline
(onset, quit, continued,
nonsmoker). Logistic
regression, but log-
odds ratios not
reported.
Approval of cigarette ads at baseline.
Onset (adoption) of smoking is
positively related to approval of

advertising is unrelated to onset at one-
year follow-up and positively related at
two-year follow-up. Smoking
education classes have a significant
negative effect in one of four cases
(girls` teacher-led).
Father smokes, mother smokes,
sister smokes, best friend ever
smokes, best friend currently
smokes, believes most adults smoke,
