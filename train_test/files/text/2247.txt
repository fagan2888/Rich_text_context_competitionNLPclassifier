The Progression of Cardiometabolic Disease: Validation of a
New Cardiometabolic Disease Staging System Applicable
to Obesity
Fangjian Guo1, Douglas R. Moellering1 and W. Timothy Garvey1,2
Objective: To validate a Cardiometabolic Disease Staging (CMDS) system for assigning risk level for dia-
betes, and all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.
Design and Methods: Two large national cohorts, CARDIA and NHANES III, were used to validate
CMDS. CMDS: Stage 0: metabolically healthy; Stage 1: one or two metabolic syndrome risk factors
[other than impaired fasting glucose (IFG)]; Stage 2: IFG or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or metabolic
syndrome (without IFG); Stage 3: two of three (IFG, IGT, and/or metabolic syndrome); and Stage 4: type
2 diabetes mellitus/CVD.
Results: In the CARDIA study, compared with Stage 0 metabolically healthy subjects, adjusted risk for
diabetes exponentially increased from Stage 1 [hazard ratio (HR) 2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.76-
4.55], to Stage 2 (HR 8.06, 95% CI 4.91-13.2), to Stage 3 (HR 23.5, 95% CI 13.7-40.1) (P for trend
<0.001). In NHANES III, both cumulative incidence and multivariable adjusted HRs markedly increased
for both all-cause and CVD mortality with advancement of the risk stage from Stages 0 to 4. Adjustment
for body mass index (BMI) minimally affected the risks for diabetes and all-cause/CVD mortality using
CMDS.
Conclusion: CMDS can discriminate a wide range of risk for diabetes, CVD mortality, and all-cause mor-
tality independent of BMI, and should be studied as a risk assessment tool to guide interventions that
prevent and treat cardiometabolic disease.

Introduction
The spectrum of cardiometabolic disease begins with insulin resist-
ance, a trait that is expressed early in life, and then progresses to
the clinically identifiable high-risk states of metabolic syndrome and
prediabetes, and then to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardi-
ovascular disease (CVD). The consequences of cardiometabolic dis-
ease are severe. T2DM, which is epidemic in the United States (1)
and worldwide (2), is associated with elevated risk for morbidity
and mortality (3) and high social costs (1), and CVD remains the
leading cause of death in Western societies. To stem the increasing
prevalence of T2DM and to reduce CVD risks, it will be necessary
to identify high-risk individuals early in the progression of cardio-
metabolic disease and intervene with effective strategies for disease
prevention.
Obesity can exacerbate insulin resistance and impel cardiometabolic
disease progression. However, the relationship between generalized
obesity, as measured by the body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), and car-
diometabolic disease is complex. For example, insulin resistance
exists largely independent of BMI (4), and BMI is a poor predictor
of CVD compared with measures of fat distribution such as waist/
hip ratio (5). Also, up to 30% of obese individuals (i.e., BMI  30)

Obesity
are relatively insulin sensitive, giving rise to the term "healthy
obese" (6). Thus, obesity is neither necessary nor sufficient to
explain the pathophysiology underlying cardiometabolic disease.
Even so, weight loss can be used as a therapeutic tool. Weight loss
whether achieved by lifestyle intervention (7), medications (8), or
bariatric surgery (9) can prevent progression to T2DM in high-risk
individuals, ameliorate dyslipidemia, lower blood pressures, and
improve glucose tolerance.
Before 2012, clinicians used lifestyle modification and a limited num-
ber of modestly effective medications in efforts to combat obesity,
with bariatric surgery reserved for more severe or refractory cases
(10). In the summer of 2012, the FDA approved two new medications,
phentermine plus topiramate extended release (phentermine/topira-
mate ER) and locaserin, to be used as adjuncts to lifestyle modifica-
tion in the treatment of overweight and obesity. The availability of
these safe and effective weight loss drugs represents a landmark devel-
opment in obesity pharmacotherapy, and enables an evidenced-based
medical model that incorporates more effective and comprehensive
application of lifestyle, drug, and surgical treatment options (11).
In developing a medical model for obesity management, it is impor-
tant to consider that any intervention entails risk, and treatment
must be targeted to those patients who will derive the greatest bene-
fits from the intervention to optimally balance benefit and risk.
Many treatment algorithms for obesity are based on BMI level,
which determines thresholds for indications pertaining to pharmaco-
therapy and bariatric surgery (10,12). For the reasons discussed
above, BMI is a poor indicator for use in this context; rather,
patients who will benefit most from obesity treatment have obesity-
related complications that can be ameliorated by weight loss
(10,11,13). Given that medications and surgical procedures have
inherent risks for patients and increase the cost of health care deliv-
ery, it is important to develop a staging system that identifies
patients who can most benefit from weight loss interventions, based
on complications rather than BMI per se.
In this article, we have validated a system for evaluating the stage
and severity of cardiometabolic disease. Our studies used the
NHANES III-linked mortality file (14) for cardiovascular and all-
cause mortality, and longitudinal data from the national CARDIA
study for incident T2DM (15). We have defined distinct categories
using readily available clinical information that assess future risk for
both T2DM and CVD mortality, and have called this system Cardio-
metabolic Disease Staging (CMDS). The studies have provided
insight regarding risk progression in cardiometabolic disease, and
have validated a tool that can be used by clinicians to identify treat-
ment modality and intensity for obesity based on cardiometabolic
disease severity. Such an approach may be useful to optimize the
benefit/risk ratio for interventions, and achieve the best outcomes by
aligning specific therapy with those patients who will derive the
greatest benefit.
Methods
Risk staging system
We propose a risk classification system using clinical parameters
pertinent to diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome from Adult Treat-
ment Panel III (ATP III) (3), and prediabetes/diabetes using fasting
and 2-h OGTT glucose values according to the American Diabetes
Association. The CMDS system is shown in Table 1, and was based
on results from the epidemiological and physiological literature: (i)
Stage 0 includes individuals who are relatively insulin sensitive, free
of any cardiometabolic disease risk factors, and without increased
risk of diabetes or CVD (6), referred to as "metabolically healthy
obese" (16); (ii) Stage 1 includes patients who meet only one or two
ATPIII criteria (waist circumference, elevated blood pressure, tri-
glycerides, and HDL-C) but who are still at increased risk of future
T2DM and CVD (17,18); (iii) Stage 2 is comprised of patients who
meet criteria for either metabolic syndrome or impaired fasting glu-
cose (IFG) alone or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) alone; (iv)
Stage 3 includes patients with any two of three of these conditions
(metabolic syndrome, IFG, and IGT) who exhibit approximately
double the risk for future diabetes compared with those who have
either condition alone (18,19); finally, (v) Stage 4 subjects have
diagnoses of T2DM and/or CVD as patients with previous myocar-
dial infarction and T2DM patients without a previous myocardial
infarction have equal risk of future coronary heart disease mortality
(20). Thus, the CMDS system was rationally constructed based on
multiple published observations. Then, we proceeded to empirically
validate the predictive value of CMDS for differential risk of future
T2DM and mortality using data from the Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) and the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts.
CARDIA study
Data from the CARDIA study was used to validate CMDS against
future risk for T2DM. The CARDIA study (15) is a large, ongoing
cohort study, which began in 1985-1986. CARDIA recruited 5,115
young black and white adults (46% male) aged 18-30 years from
four sites in the United States, including Birmingham, AL; Chicago,
IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA. Oral glucose tolerance tests
(OGTTs) with measurement of the 2-h glucose concentration were
not initiated until CARDIA year 10, and, for this reason, year 10
served as baseline year for this study, with follow-up to year 20.
These analyses included 3,315 participants with valid 2-h glucose
measures at year 10 after excluding pregnant women, participants
with diabetes or CVDs, and participants without enough information
for assignment to risk category. Site institutional review committee
approval and informed consent were obtained.
Measures. BMI (kg/m2) was computed and standardized blood
pressures were obtained by sphygmomanometer. Standing waist cir-
cumference was measured at a level laterally that is midway
between the iliac crest and the lowest lateral portion of the rib cage
and anteriorly midway between the xiphoid process of the sternum
and the umbilicus. Serum glucose and plasma lipids were assayed
using the fasting blood sample. Seventy-five-gram OGTTs were per-
formed at the year 10 and year 20 examinations. Each participant
was asked to fast for 12 h; however, participants were asked to
report the time of their last meal, so the length of the fasting period
could be calculated. Incident diabetes was defined as participants
reporting a diagnosis of diabetes, or having a documented fasting
plasma glucose 126 mg/dL, and/or 2-h glucose 200 mg/dL.
NHANES III
Data from NHANES III-linked mortality file was used to validate
CMDS against mortality risk. NHANES III is a cross-sectional

survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) during 1988-1994, using a complex, stratified, multistage
probability sample to represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized, US
population. The study was approved by the NCHS Institutional
Review Board, and all adult participants provided written informed
consent. Information on mortality from public-use mortality files
was linked to the National Death Index, with follow-up through
December 31, 2006. Males and nonpregnant females aged 40-74
years who had been randomized to the morning session of the
mobile examination center and completed an oral glucose test were
considered eligible. Participants without adequate information to
assess risk staging classification were excluded.
Measures. Subjects were grouped into three BMI categories: 30
(obese), 25-29.9 (overweight), and <25 (normal). Race/ethnicity
was self-reported as non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic
Black (NHB), Mexican American (MEX), other Hispanic, and other.
Standardized blood pressures were obtained by sphygmomanometer.
Standing waist circumference was measured just above the upper-
most lateral border of the ilium. Plasma glucose and serum lipids
were measured as delineated in the NHANES Laboratory Procedures
Manual (21). The method of probabilistic matching (22) was used to
link NHANES III participants with the National Death Index to
ascertain vital status and mortality through December 31, 2006. It
was found that 96.1% of the deceased participants and 99.4% of the
living participants were correctly classified, using identical matching
methodology applied to the NHANES I Epidemiological Follow-up
Study for validation purposes (22).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out with SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute). A two-sided P < 0.05 was determined to be statistically
significant. Cox regression models were used to examine risk stage
in relation to incident diabetes using CARDIA data. Follow-up time
was calculated as the difference between the baseline set at year 10
of the CARDIA study and the year when diabetes was first identi-
fied, examination year 20, or the year a participant was censored,
whichever came first. Multivariable adjusted Cox model 1 was
adjusted for age, sex, race, income, education, current smoker, cur-
rent alcohol drinker, and parent diabetes history. Model 2 was addi-
tionally adjusted for BMI.
All analyses for NHANES data took into account differential proba-
bilities of selection and the complex sample design by using sample
weights, following NHANES Analytic and Reporting Guidelines.
Standard errors were calculated using Taylor series linearization.
We analyzed all-cause and CVD mortality using Kaplan-Meier sur-
vival curve estimates and Cox regression models. Model 1 was
adjusted for age, sex, race, income, education, current smoker, and
current alcohol drinker. Model 2 was further adjusted for BMI. Sen-
sitivity analysis was conducted after excluding participants with can-
cer, CVD, or hepatitis C in the full multivariable adjusted model.

We examined the relationship between the risk system and incident
diabetes, or mortality, in all study participants and in those subjects
who were overweight and obese. The proportional hazards assump-
tion for Cox models was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals, and
no violation was found.
Results
Incident diabetes
The CARDIA study was used to assess incident diabetes, and base-
line characteristics (i.e., CARDIA year 10 examination) are pre-
sented in Tables 2 and 3. Participants in CARDIA were relatively
young with a median age of 35 years. A total of 29.3% of over-
weight or obese participants were metabolically healthy (i.e., no risk
factors; Stage 0, Supporting Information Table).
Over the 10-year follow-up period, there were 203 cases of newly
diagnosed diabetes resulting in an overall crude cumulative diabetes
incidence of 6.1%. The cumulative diabetes incidence across risk
levels of Stages 0, 1, 2, and 3 was 1.8, 5.9, 18.2, and 41.8%, respec-
tively, as shown in Figure 1A. Among overweight or obese partici-
pants, cumulative diabetes incidence was 8.9% overall, and across
risk levels of Stages 0, 1, 2, and 3 was 2.2, 7.3, 19.0, and 41.0%,
respectively (Supporting Information Figure 2). Clearly, patients
categorized in Stage 0 (metabolically healthy) exhibited little tend-
ency to progress to diabetes, while cumulative diabetes incidence
rose at progressively higher rates as the risk stage was advanced
from Stage 1 to Stage 3. The impact of risk stage on diabetes inci-
dence was similar in both genders and in Whites and Blacks (Sup-
porting Information Figure 1).
In the same manner, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for
diabetes increased as a function of advancing CMDS as shown in
Figure 1B. Compared with Stage 0 metabolically healthy subjects,
adjusted risk for diabetes exponentially increased from Stage 1 (HR
2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.76-4.55), to Stage 2 (HR 8.06,
95% CI 4.91-13.2), to Stage 3 (HR 23.5, 95% CI 13.7-40.1) (P for
trend <0.001). Even after adjusting for BMI in Figure 1C, HRs
increased as a function of risk stage with statistically significant
higher risk in Stage 1 (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.05-2.92), Stage 2 (HR
4.60, 95% CI 2.67-7.94), and Stage 3 (HR 11.0, 95% CI 5.96-20.2),
although the magnitude of the risk increments was reduced.
Adjusted HRs for incident diabetes also increased with higher stage
when only overweight or obese participants were included in the
analysis (Supporting Information Figure 3).
All-cause and CVD mortality
NHANES III was used to assess effects on all-cause and CVD mor-
tality, and baseline characteristics are presented in Tables 2 and 3.
The NHANES III sample was comprised of 3,964 subjects who
reported that they had fasted for at least 8 h before OGTT with

sufficient information for risk staging. For the most part, participants
were evenly distributed into risk category stages.
Over a median follow-up of 173 months, there were 1,012 all-cause
mortality cases ascertained, and the cumulative mortality rate was
14.7 per 1,000 person-years. The cumulative mortality rates increased
progressively with advancing CMDS risk stage (P < 0.001 for trend),
and were 6.5, 10.1, 11.9, 17.7, and 29.2 per 1,000 person-years across
risk Stages 0 to 4, respectively. In total, 404 cases of CVD-related
deaths were reported. The CVD cumulative mortality rate was 5.4 per
1,000 person-years overall, and also increased with risk stage (P <
0.001 for trend), with 0.7, 2.8, 4.6, 4.9, and 14.3 per 1,000 person-
years across risk Stages 0 to 4, respectively.
Kaplan-Meier plots for survival probability as a function of CMDS
are shown in Figure 2A for all-cause mortality and in Figure 3A for
CVD mortality. Both all-cause and CVD mortality increased with
advancing risk stage in the entire cohort. This applied to both gen-
ders and all ethnic/racial subgroups (Supporting Information Figures
4 and 7), and when the analyses were confined to only those sub-
jects who were overweight or obese at baseline (Supporting Infor-
mation Figures 5 and 8). Similarly, multivariable adjusted HRs for
all-cause mortality are also clearly increased as a function of higher
CMDS risk stage. In Figure 2B, with Stage 0 metabolically healthy
subjects as the referent group, risk Stage 2 (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.01-
2.32), Stage 3 (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.38-3.47), and Stage 4 (HR 3.12,
95% CI 1.90-5.10) were associated with progressively higher
adjusted mortality HRs. These results were similar after adjusting
for baseline BMI (Figure 2C) or after excluding participants with
CVD, cancer, or hepatitis C at baseline (data not shown). Adjusted
HRs for all-cause mortality also increased with higher stage in over-
weight or obese participants (Supporting Information Figure 6).
Higher CMDS risk stages also predicted progressively greater risk
for CVD mortality. In Figure 3B, Stage 1 (HR 3.63, 95% CI 1.36-
9.65), Stage 2 (HR 5.65, 95% CI 2.17-14.7), Stage 3 (HR 5.67, 95%
CI 2.30-14.08), and Stage 4 (HR 14.6, 95% CI 6.06-35.4) risk cate-
gories were associated with progressively higher adjusted hazard for
CVD mortality with the lowest risk category Stage 0 serving as the
referent group. We further observed that these results were similar
after adjusting for BMI (Figure 3C) or after excluding participants
with CVD, cancer, or hepatitis C at baseline (data not shown).
Adjusted HRs for CVD mortality also increased with higher stage in
overweight or obese participants (Supporting Information Figure 9).
Over a 10-year follow-up period in CARDIA, CMDS risk categories
(Stages 0 to 3) discriminated 20-fold differences in both the cumu-
lative incidence (1.8-41.8%) and adjusted HRs (1.0-23.5) for diabe-
tes. In NHANES, CMDS Stages 0 to 4 differentiated cumulative all-
cause mortality rates ranging from 6.5 to 29.2 per 1,000 person-
years and adjusted HRs from 1.0 to 3.12, and CVD mortality rates
from 0.7 to 14.3 per 1,000 person-years and adjusted HRs from 1.0
to 14.6. Thus, CMDS is a strong predictor of incident diabetes, all-
cause mortality, and CVD mortality.
Discussion
Cardiometabolic disease staging
We used two large national cohorts, the CARDIA study for incident
diabetes and the NHANES III-linked mortality file for all-cause or
CVD mortality, to validate a single risk staging system for both met-
abolic and vascular outcomes in cardiometabolic disease. We estab-
lished five categories (Stages 0 to 4) for predicting increasing risk
for future T2DM and CVD mortality using parameters from the
physical examination and laboratory measurements that would be
immediately available to clinicians. These parameters are relevant to
the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome using ATPIII guidelines (23)
and prediabetes as defined by the American Diabetes Association,
and include waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sures, fasting and 2-h OGTT blood glucose levels, triglycerides, and
HDL-C. Our intention was to establish a clinically useful paradigm
that will allow clinicians to identify modalities and intensities of
therapy for prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases in
a manner that optimally balances benefit and risk. Our analyses
clearly established that the five stages: (i) define populations at pro-
gressively increasing risk of future T2DM and all-cause and CVD
mortality; (ii) partition populations with substantial numbers into all
the various risk categories; (iii) serve to differentiate individuals
over a wide range of disease risk; and (iv) maintain predictive value
in both genders and across ethnic/racial subpopulations.
CMDS and the progression of cardiometabolic
disease
The staging system that was validated in this study confirms isolated
observations but, moreover, provides an integrated understanding of
the progressive nature and spectrum of cardiometabolic disease. For
example, our data confirm that a significant proportion of

overweight and obese individuals do not have cardiometabolic risk
factors (6,24), equivalent to 19% of the CARDIA cohort, and now
prospectively demonstrate that these individuals (i.e., Stage 0) also
exhibit low rates of future diabetes and all-cause and CVD mortal-
ity. Our study also indicates that patients with one or two risk fac-
tors (Stage 1), who do not meet criteria for either metabolic syn-
drome or prediabetes, exhibit increased risk of future diabetes. This
is consistent with the idea advanced by us (25) and others (17,18)
that these diagnostic categories have high specificity but low sensi-
tivity for identifying insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disease.
Nevertheless, as cardiometabolic disease progresses to fulfillment of
criteria for metabolic syndrome or IFG or IGT (Stage 2), patients
are at increased risk for T2DM and CVD, and the risks approxi-
mately double when any two of these three are present (Stage 3).
This is consistent with previous data showing patients who meet cri-
teria for both metabolic syndrome and prediabetes are at substan-
tially higher risk for T2DM than patients who satisfy criteria for
only one of these diagnoses (18-20). Stage 3 is identical to a high-
risk state for future diabetes identified in a position statement from
the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, who recom-
mend consideration of treatment with antidiabetic drugs in these
patients (26). Stage 4 is defined by the presence of overt T2DM
and/or CVD, and reflects the high risk conferred by T2DM per se,
even in the absence of known CVD, for future CVD events (20).
Thus, in single cohorts of patients, our study demonstrates the full
continuum of the cardiometabolic disease process, and elucidates the
progressive severity of the disease using quantifiable clinical
markers and manifestations relevant to both metabolic and vascular
components.
BMI was not included in the determination of cardiometabolic dis-
ease risk because previous studies have indicated that insulin resist-
ance exists largely independent of generalized adiposity (4,25,27)
and that BMI is a poor independent predictor of CVD (28). This
data substantiate that BMI is weak independent predictor of future
diabetes as well as all-cause and CVD mortality because adjustment
for BMI did not substantially alter risks predicted by CMDS. Also,
the predictive value of CMDS was unchanged when lean subjects
were omitted and CMDS was applied only to overweight and obese
individuals. In contrast, waist circumference is a strong independent
predictor of insulin resistance and CVD (28,29), and is incorporated
into CMDS. It is also apparent that HbA1c was not used as a mea-
sure of diabetes or prediabetes, and this is because we (30) and
others (31) have shown that HbA1c has low sensitivity for these
diagnoses, and is responsible for a high false-negative rate among
patients diagnosed using the gold standard measures of fasting glu-
cose combined with 2-h glucose values. It is also important to con-
sider that a high proportion of patients with prediabetes on the basis
of IGT (i.e., elevated 2-h OGTT only) will be missed when only
fasting glucose and HbA1c are available, and that this proportion of
missed diagnoses increases as a function of age (32). Elevated 2-h
glucose is also a strong independent risk factor for CVD (33). These

data provide rationale for increased utilization of OGTT in evaluat-
ing cardiometabolic disease risk and for the incorporation of 2-h
glucose in CMDS.
Application of CMDS
Thus, we have validated a single staging system for cardiometabolic
disease that can be used to estimate risk for both T2DM and all-
cause and CVD mortality. CMDS should be studied as a tool to
optimize the benefit/risk ratio when selecting interventions with
variable safety and efficacy for the prevention or treatment of cardi-
ometabolic diseases risk. Although CMDS can be used as a guide-
line for any intervention, it is the recent advances in treatment of
obesity that have impelled this study. The availability of two new
effective medications, phentermine/topiramate ER (8) and lorcaserin
(34), has enabled a comprehensive evidence-based medical model
for effective and balanced utilization of lifestyle modification, drugs,
and bariatric surgery (11). It is important to identify which patients
will derive the greatest benefit from these interventions because,
with 70% of US adults being overweight or obese (35), it is not
desirable or feasible to treat all patients with medical or surgical
therapy. Furthermore, available therapies are often unable to achieve
optimal cosmetic results but can dramatically improve both the car-
diometabolic and mechanical complications of obesity (8,11,12,34).
The patients who will benefit most from therapy have obesity-
related complications that can be ameliorated by weight loss.
Currently, BMI is featured predominantly in treatment algorithms
that determine therapeutic indications for overweight and obesity,
such as that proposed by the NHLBI (12). However, the cardiometa-
bolic and many mechanical complications of obesity exist independ-
ent of BMI (4,16,25,28), and may not identify patients who will
most benefit from treatment. From this perspective, baseline BMI is
less important in targeting patients who will benefit most from
weight loss than the existence and severity of complications at base-
line (11,13,36). CMDS can be used to identify patients at various
degrees of risk for T2DM and CVD mortality, and serve as a guide-
line for selection of therapeutic modality and intensity. This concept
underscores a complications-centric model, as opposed to a BMI-
centric model, for obesity management (11,12,23).
Other approaches to risk staging
There are other approaches to risk evaluation for cardiometabolic
disease. The clinician should certainly evaluate patients for meta-
bolic syndrome and prediabetes, even though metabolic syndrome
has high specificity but low sensitivity for identifying patients with
insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disease (25). Various risk
scores have also been constructed using information from the history
and physical examination (37) or using clinical laboratory assays
(38), and these can be used to stage risk in insulin-resistant patients
whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome
or prediabetes. The Edmonton Obesity Staging System has been

developed as a valuable guideline for obesity management and
incorporates an assessment of both cardiometabolic disease and
mechanical complications (13). The Edmonton system features five
stages (stages 0 to 4), and has been validated to predict only all-
cause mortality. Even so, CMDS Stages 1, 2, and 3 would all be
included in Edmonton Stage 1. As we have clearly demonstrated
that there was a significant range of differential risk among patients
in CMDS Stages 1 to 3, from this perspective, CMDS provides a
more granular dissection of cardiometabolic disease risk.
Study strengths and limitations
Strengths include the use of longitudinal data from two large
national cohorts, the CARDIA study and the NHANES III-linked
mortality file. The studies involved both genders and several racial/
ethnic groups, and this has enabled our findings to be readily
applied to the general population. Second, we validated CMDS for
predicting risk of incident diabetes, CVD mortality, and all-cause
mortality over a wide range of BMI. These aspects substantiate the
broad application of CMDS for interventions designed to prevent or
treat cardiometabolic disease.
This study also has limitations. NHANES, as in any survey, may
have sampling and nonsampling errors. Additionally, only a subset
of participants received a glucose tolerance test, and some of those
participants did not fast over 8 h, hence they were also excluded
from the analysis. The sample size is not large enough to permit
extensive subgroup analyses, especially for CVD mortality. Further,
mortality follow-up was available only till late 2006, and updated
follow-up information has not yet been released. In the CARDIA
study, ascertainment of diabetes in year 15 was made by fasting glu-
cose only, whereas diabetes in year 20 was ascertained by both fast-
ing and 2-h OGTT glucose. Finally, clinical trials will be needed to
determine whether the application of CMDS will enhance outcomes,
benefit/risk ratio, safety, and cost-effectiveness of interventions,
such as weight loss therapy, to prevent and treat cardiometabolic
disease (e.g., T2DM).
Conclusions
CMDS can discriminate a wide range of risk for diabetes, CVD
mortality, and all-cause mortality independent of BMI, and can be
used as a risk assessment tool to guide interventions that prevent
and treat cardiometabolic disease. In particular, such a tool can be
useful in a complications-centric approach to the treatment of obe-
sity (11,39,40), wherein the goal of weight loss is to ameliorate the
complications of obesity, particularly those related to cardiometa-
bolic disease risk. Prospective interventional trials are needed to val-
idate whether that application of CMDS, as a guide to the selection
of obesity treatment, will enhance patient outcomes and cost-
effectiveness of care. The goal is to target treatment intensity,
whether involving lifestyle modification, weight loss medication, or
bariatric surgery options, to those patients who will derive the great-
est benefits from the intervention according to considerations that
optimally balance benefit and risk. O
