Abstract
Objectives: To compare two intrathecal anaesthetics, bupivacaine and levobupivacaine, for their
effects on motor and sensory blockade and haemodynamics in patients aged !65 years undergoing
transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) or transurethral resection of the urinary bladder
(TUR-M).
Methods: Patients scheduled to undergo TUR-P or TUR-M were randomized to receive either
3 ml (15 mg) 0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine (group L) or 3 ml (15 mg) of 0.5% hyperbaric
bupivacaine (group B) for spinal anaesthesia. The onset time, maximum level and time to reach the
maximum level of sensory and motor blockade were recorded. Changes to haemodynamic
parameters were also recorded.
Results: The study randomized 100 patients: 57 to group L and 43 to group B. Levobupivacaine did
not cause any significant changes in haemodynamic parameters, including systolic blood pressure,
and showed a similar sensory block onset time compared with bupivacaine, but it had a significantly
longer motor block onset time compared with bupivacaine.
Conclusion: These current findings suggest that levobupivacaine can be used as a substitute for
bupivacaine for spinal anaesthesia in elderly patients !65 years of age undergoing elective TUR-P
or TUR-M operations.

change in the age distribution curve because
of the addition of elderly to the global
population. There has been an escalation
in the proportion of the population that is
considered to be in old age (or as elderly
people), defined as being !65 years: a rise
from 4% of the total population in 1900 to
13% in 2010.1
Although spinal anaesthesia provides
some advantages for elderly people com-
pared with general anaesthesia, it may still
have some critical disadvantages. For exam-
ple, early mobilization during the post-
operative period, a minimal number of
respiratory complications, continuity of
analgesia and short hospitalization time
are among the advantages of spinal anaes-
thesia compared with general anaesthesia,
but hypotension and bradycardia are the
two major disadvantages associated with
spinal anaesthesia.2­6
Spinal anaesthesia is frequently used
during urological operations because it
provides some major advantages over gen-
eral anaesthesia, such as a shorter time to
onset of motor block, and it allows for the
use of lower volumes of local anaes-
thetic.6,7 Although there is a degree of
hypotension risk associated with spinal
anaesthesia, it enables early detection of
excessive fluid load and hyponatraemia.3
Effective spinal anaesthesia is possible with
the correct choice of local anaesthetic.
Suitable local anaesthetics should provide
effective anaesthesia and analgesia during
the operation and should have no side
effects. Levobupivacaine is a local anaes-
thetic that is relatively new to clinical
practice.8­10 Levobupivacaine is an S(À)
enantiomer of bupivacaine and both agents
have similar pharmacokinetic proper-
ties.8­10 There are several studies that
have reported that the cardiovascular and
central nervous system-related side effects
of levobupivacaine are less frequent than
those experienced with bupivacaine.8­10
Some toxic effects can be seen with high
doses of bupivacaine and when it is used
for a long duration.8­10 Based on these
reports,8­10 levobupivacaine is recom-
mended as an alternative to bupivacaine
for patients who experience cardiovascular
system-related side effects. However, it has
been emphasized that more studies must be
conducted to investigate the effects of
levobupivacaine in detail.8­10 Despite the
fact that levobupivacaine has been widely
used for obstetric and nonobstetric epi-
dural anaesthesia,8 there is still a lack of
comparative clinical studies that focus on
intrathecal levobupivacaine administration.
This study aimed to compare these two
intrathecal anaesthetics, bupivacaine and
levobupivacaine, for their effects on motor
and sensory blockade and haemodynamics
in patients aged !65 years who underwent
spinal anaesthesia during transurethral
resection of the prostate (TUR-P) or trans-
urethral resection of the urinary bladder
(TUR-M) operations.
Patients and methods
Patients
This randomized study enrolled patients
who underwent TUR-P or TUR-M oper-
ations under spinal anaesthesia between
January 2006 and March 2008 in the
Department of Anaesthesiology and
Reanimation, Faculty of Medicine,
Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.
Patients aged !65 years with American
Society of Anesthesiologists physical status
2­3 were included in the study.11 Patients
who were allergic to local anaesthetic agents
were excluded from the study.
The study was approved by the Akdeniz
University Ethics Committee of the
Faculty of Medicine (12.12.2006; no.
Ethics-497). Written consent was obtained
from each patient to receive anaesthesia
and verbal consent was obtained from
each patient before anaesthesia was
administered.

Anaesthesia and surgical procedures
All patients were closely monitored through-
out the procedure. The monitoring included
electrocardiography, noninvasive blood
pressure monitoring and peripheral oxygen
saturation measurements. Using a sealed
envelope technique, the patients were ran-
domly allocated to receive either bupiva-
caine (MarcaineÕ Spinal 0.5% Heavy;
AstraZeneca, London, UK) or levobupiva-
caine (ChirocaineÕ, 0.5%; Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) for
spinal anaesthesia. A 25 G spinal needle
(SpinocanÕ; B Braun, Melsungen,
Germany) was inserted, and after clear
cerebrospinal fluid became visible, one of
these two solutions was injected into the
subarachnoid interspace: 3 ml (15mg) 0.5%
hyperbaric bupivacaine or 3 ml (15 mg)
0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine. In order to
reduce the risk of hypotension, intravenous
prehydration was applied using 500 ml 0.9%
NaCl given over 10­15 min to all of the
patients who were administered either levo-
bupivacaine or bupivacaine. Following pre-
hydration, saline infusion (0.9% NaCl at
4 ml/kg per h) was continued until the end of
the operation.
The TUR-P and TUR-M procedures
were undertaken to allow the resection of
prostate or bladder lesions and they were
carried out in the lithotomy position. The
anaesthetist (D.G.) was blinded to the drugs
used for spinal anaesthesia.
Clinical assessments
The starting time for all of the evaluations
was set as the time when administration of
the intrathecal anaesthetic injection was
completed. Time to onset of sensory block,
time to the onset of the maximum level of
sensory block, and the time and duration of
achieving the maximum level of sensory
block were recorded. The same variables
were measured for motor block. Every 30 s
after the intrathecal injection, the levels of
sensory and motor block were recorded. A
scoring system was used for recording the
extent of sensory blockade based on the
thoracic sensory dermatomes 4­10 at 5, 10,
15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60 min after the
intrathecal anaesthetic injection and imme-
diately after the operation was completed
(Table 1). The extent of motor block can be
assessed using the Bromage scale at the same
time-points.12 The Bromage scale defines no
motor block as the full ability to flex the
knees and feet (score 0); partial motor block
as the ability to flex the knees and resist
gravity with full movement of the feet (score
1); almost complete motor block as the
inability to flex the knees but retained ability
to flex the feet (score 2); and complete motor
block as the inability to move the legs or feet
(score 3).
Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure
(MBP), heart rate and peripheral oxygen
saturation were measured before the oper-
ation, immediately after the intrathecal
anaesthetic injection, at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 45 and 60 min after the intrathecal
anaesthetic injection and immediately after
the operation was completed.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 11.0

ing the extent of sensory blockade

WindowsÕ. The sample size was calculated
for the power of this study being 50% (effect
size was based on a pilot study of four
patients in whom changes in heart rate and
blood pressure after drug administration
were observed). The two groups were com-
pared using Student's t-test when there was
normal distribution of the data and Mann­
Whitney U-test was used for the rest of the
variables. 2-test was used to compare cat-
egorical variables. Paired t-test was used for
intergroup comparisons and for variables
complying with normal distribution.
Wilcoxon's test was used for the rest of the
variables. A P-value <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Enrolled patients who did not accept spinal
anaesthesia and patients who underwent
general anaesthesia because of unsuccessful
spinal anaesthesia were excluded from the
analysis. The study thus included 100 ran-
domized patients: 57 to group L (0.5%
levobupivacaine) and 43 to group B (0.5%
bupivacaine). The demographic and clinical
characteristics of the study participants are
shown in Table 2. There were no statistically
significant between-group differences in age,
weight, operation duration, sex, and the
proportion of patients that underwent
either TUR-P or TUR-M.
There was no significant difference in the
time to onset of sensory block between the
two groups (Table 3). There was no signifi-
cant difference in the time to onset of
maximum sensory block between the two
groups. The duration of two segment regres-
sion of the sensory block was signifi-
cantly lower in group B (bupivacaine)
compared with group L (levobupivacaine)
(P ¼ 0.0001), indicating that sensory block
regressed more rapidly in group B (bupiva-
caine) compared with group L (levobupiva-
caine). There were no statistically significant
differences between the two groups for the
sensory block scores that were recorded at 5,
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60 min after the
intrathecal anaesthetic injection. The sen-
sory block score immediately after the oper-
ation was completed was significantly lower
in group L (levobupivacaine) compared with
group B (bupivacaine) (P ¼ 0.045).
The time to onset of motor block was
significantly longer in group L (levobupiva-
caine) compared with group B (bupivacaine)

maximum motor block was significantly

were compared, those recorded at 5 (P ¼

in group L (levobupivacaine) compared with
group B (bupivacaine). The motor block
scores recorded at 60 min after the intra-
thecal anaesthetic injection and immediately
after the operation was completed were not
significantly different between the two
groups.
In group L (levobupivacaine), the motor
block score at 5 min after the intrathecal
anaesthetic injection was significantly lower
than the motor block score at 10 min and
15 min and the motor block score taken
immediately after the operation was
completed (P < 0.05 for all comparisons).
The motor block scores at 20, 25, 30 and
45 min were similar to the motor block score
taken immediately after the operation was
completed and there were no significant
differences between any of these time-points.
In group B (bupivacaine), starting from
10 min, the motor block score remained
similar throughout the measurements and
there were no statistically significant differ-
ences between subsequent time-points. The
motor block score measured at 5 min after
the intrathecal anaesthetic injection was
relatively low and it was significantly lower
compared with the scores recorded at all
time-points and the motor block score taken
immediately after the operation was com-
pleted (P < 0.05 for all comparisons).
Following intrathecal injection of the
anaesthetic, SBP was recorded at pre-speci-
fied time-points (Table 5). There were no
cases of hypotension that required intraven-
ous ephedrine treatment. In group L

tive SBP. In group B (bupivacaine), SBP
decreased until 20 min after the intrathecal
anaesthetic injection and then remained at a
relatively stable level to the end of the
operation. DBP and MBP changes showed
similar changes as those described for the
SBP for both of the study groups (data not

ences in the changes in heart rate between
the two groups during the course of the
observations.
Discussion
In this present study spinal anaesthesia was
administered to patients aged !65 years who
were scheduled to have elective TUR-P and
TUR-M operations. The effects of two
routinely used spinal anaesthetics, 0.5%
isobaric levobupivacaine and 0.5% hyper-
baric bupivacaine, on motor and sensory
block as well as on haemodynamic param-
eters were compared. In terms of sensory
blockade in the current study, the duration
of two segment regression of the sensory
block was significantly lower with bupiva-
caine compared with levobupivacaine; the
sensory block score immediately after the
operation was completed was significantly
lower with levobupivacaine compared with
bupivacaine. In terms of motor blockade in
the current study, levobupivacaine was
associated with significantly longer times to
onset of motor block and maximum motor
block compared with bupivacaine; the
motor block scores for levobupivacaine at
5­45 min after intrathecal injection were
significantly lower compared with those for
bupivacaine. In this present study, levobu-
pivacaine resulted in slow changes in SBP
and SBP was not observed to decrease
until 5 min after intrathecal injection.
Bupivacaine was also associated with a
decrease in SBP that was first observed at
5 min after intrathecal injection and SBP
continued to decrease until 20 min after
intrathecal injection. Bupivacaine anaesthe-
sia was associated with significant differ-
ences in the SBP recorded at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
and 30 min and at the end of the operation
compared with the preoperative SBP.
A prospective randomized double-blind
study that compared the anaesthetic and
haemodynamic effects of intrathecal levobu-
pivacaine and bupivacaine demonstrated
that levobupivacaine provided a faster
increase in the Bromage score from 0 to 2
compared with bupivacaine, but there were
no significant differences observed in any of
the haemodynamic characteristics.13 In con-
trast to these findings,13 the present study
showed that the time to onset of motor
block was significantly faster with bupiva-
caine compared with levobupivacaine.
Similarly, the time to onset of maximum
motor block was significantly faster with
bupivacaine compared with levobupivacaine
in the present study.
In a study of intrathecally administered
3 ml (15 mg) of 0.5% levobupivacaine in 18
patients who were scheduled to undergo
elective lower extremity surgeries, it was
observed that the mean time to onset of
sensory block was 3 min (range 2­10 min)
and the mean time to onset of motor block
was 5 min (range 2­10 min).14 In this present
study, the time to onset of sensory block and
the time to onset motor block in patients
treated with levobupivacaine were higher
than in patients treated with bupivacaine. A
randomized, double-blind study of spinal
anaesthesia in 60 patients undergoing ingu-
inal hernia repair that compared 8 mg hyper-
baric 0.5% bupivacaine, 8 mg hyperbaric
0.5% levobupivacaine and 12 mg hyperbaric
0.5% ropivacaine found that the onset time
and intraoperative efficacy of levobupiva-
caine and bupivacaine were similar.15 In this
present study of 15 mg hyperbaric bupiva-
caine compared with 15 mg isobaric levobu-
pivacaine in patients undergoing TUR-P
382 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
and TUR-M operations, the time to onset of
motor block was significantly longer for
patients treated with levobupivacaine and
the motor block score only reached levels
comparable with those of bupivacaine at
60 min after intrathecal injection.
In terms of haemodynamic parameters, a
comparative study of healthy volunteers
who were administered intravenous injec-
tions of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine
reported that compared with their baseline
values, both the stroke index and ejection
fraction decreases were significantly smaller
for levobupivacaine than bupivacaine; there
was a smaller degree of prolongation in the
PR interval with levobupivacaine than
bupivacaine, but the difference was not
statistically significant.16 Hypotension is a
very frequent side effect after spinal anaes-
thesia and it may cause serious increases
in morbidity: it can even lead to mortal-
ity.4,17,18 In this present study, intravenous
prehydration with 0.9% NaCl was given to
all patients and saline infusions (0.9% NaCl
at 4 ml/kg per h) were continued until the
end of the operation; and there were no
cases of hypotension that required intraven-
ous ephedrine treatment.
It has been shown that the sympathetic
nervous system-related side effects of levo-
bupivacaine are less frequent than those
associated with the use of bupivacaine and
the mean convulsive dose for levobupiva-
caine is higher than that of bupivacaine.19,20
Previous animal studies reported that the
possibility of causing convulsions or apnoea
was lower with levobupivacaine than bupi-
vacaine.19,21 Whereas several cases of central
nervous system toxicity have been reported
after intravascular injection of ropivacaine
and levobupivacaine, no cases of serious
cardiotoxicity or death have been reported
in the literature.22­24 The clinical outcomes
of levobupivacaine in children who under-
went spinal anaesthesia were similar to
those achieved with the same dose of
bupivacaine.25
A randomized, double-blind study of
intrathecally administered 0.5% isobaric
levobupivacaine or 0.5% hyperbaric bupi-
vacaine in 70 patients scheduled to
undergo elective transurethral endoscopic
surgery found similar results between the
two groups for the following variables:
duration of sensory block, duration of
two segment regression, time of onset and
expiration of motor block, side effects, and
pain scores at the beginning of the oper-
ation.26 The authors suggested that 2.5 ml
of 0.5% isobaric levobupivacaine and
0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine provided the
same clinical outcomes for spinal
anaesthesia.26
In this present study, there were no
significant differences between levobupiva-
caine and bupivacaine in terms of the sen-
sory block scores following intrathecal
injection. A prospective, randomized,
double-blind study conducted in 50 patients
who underwent urogenital surgery found no
statistically significant differences in the
sensory and motor block properties, as
well as the haemodynamic effects, of 0.5%
levobupivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine; the
authors suggested that levobupivacaine
was an effective substitute for 0.5% bupiva-
caine.27 Although animal research has
demonstrated that the duration of sen-
sory and motor block was similar for
levobupivacaine and bupivacaine,19 there
is some evidence of a small increase in
duration of sensory block with levobupiva-
caine.8 In contrast, there is also evidence
that levobupivacaine is less potent than
bupivacaine.28
The sensory blocking effects of bupiva-
caine and levobupivacaine were similar
according to these current findings. In the
bupivacaine group, there was a relatively
rapid regression of the sensory block level
although the differences between time-
points were not significant. Some clinical
studies suggest that the local anaesthetic
effects of levobupivacaine are different from
Gulec et al. 383
those of bupivacaine. For example, in
studies in patients undergoing caesarean
section, intrathecal levobupivacaine was
shown to have a similar clinical profile as
bupivacaine, but it provided a lower level of
motor block at the same dose.29,30 Good
hemodynamic stability with a reduced
prevalence of side effects has been shown
for intrathecal levobupivacaine in elderly
patients.31,32
In this present study, the haemodynamic,
sensory and motor block effects of intra-
thecal levobupivacaine and bupivacaine
injections were compared in 100 patients
!65 years of age undergoing either TUR-P
or TUR-M operations. Levobupivacaine
did not cause any significant changes in
haemodynamic parameters, and showed a
similar sensory block onset time compared
with bupivacaine, but it had a significantly
longer motor block onset time compared
with bupivacaine.
A limitation of the present study is the
small number of patients in the groups.
Further studies should be undertaken with a
large number of patients to confirm the
findings.
In conclusion, these current findings
suggest that levobupivacaine can be used
as a substitute for bupivacaine for spinal
anaesthesia in elderly patients !65 years
of age undergoing elective TUR-P
or TUR-M operations. In our opin-
ion, hyperbaric bupivacaine is the pre-
ferred option for operations of short
duration.
