In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the criminal victimization of
elderly persons. Given that homicides of the elderly are thought to occur primarily in the
context of robbery/burglary situations, this study seeks to identify situational as well as
structural and cultural factors that influence the murder of older persons. In particular, it
has been noted that Southern culture promotes a notion that one should `respect their
elders.' Using conservative Protestant affiliation as a proxy for Southern culture, this
study also examines the relationship between Southern culture and homicide of the
elderly. Findings show that Southern culture as reflected in conservative Protestant
affiliation does not insulate the elderly from victimization.
Introduction: Homicide and the Elderly
It has been well documented that the United States experiences much higher
levels of violence in relation to other industrial nations (Messner and Rosenfeld
2001). Consequently, it is not particularly surprising that various surveys often
show that fear of becoming the victim of a crime is an issue of concern for most
Americans. However, it is most interesting that fear of crime is not evenly
distributed among the population, with levels of fear being greatest for elderly
Americans (Warr 1995). In fact, fear of victimization is of greater concern than
worries about health, money, or loneliness (McCabe and Gregory 1998; Ortega
and Myles 1987). As a growing proportion of the population is comprised of
older persons, interest has increased in the elderly and many of the problems
they encounter, including their risks regarding safety and criminal victimization.
In 1995, almost 13 percent of the population of the United States were aged
65 and older (Treas 1995). It is projected that by 2050, approximately 20 percent
of Americans will fall in that age range. In essence the aging of the baby
boomers will result in the largest generation of elderly persons ever witnessed in
the United States (Bachman, Dillaway, and Lachs 1998; Takamura 1999). These
rather dramatic demographic changes related to the elderly will likely influence
public policy, especially concerning health care issues and risks associated with
aging. Historically, violent crime against the elderly is a relatively rare event,
but by virtue of the sheer number of people entering that age group, that risk is
likely to increase.
Although fear of crime among the elderly may be greater than the actual
threat of victimization, this fear may be explained in part by declines in physical
strength and in the senses, which yield increased feelings of vulnerability and
CULTURE, CONTEXT, AND HOMICIDE OF THE ELDERLY 3
powerlessness. Compared to younger victims of violence, recent research indi-
cates that elderly victims are more likely to sustain serious injuries and even
death (Bachman et al. 1998; Weaver et al. 2002). When the elderly are victims
of violence, the effect on their lives is often more significant than for younger
persons. Consequently, their fears can be more easily understood, even if the
actual risk of victimization is lower than the perceived risk. Research by McCabe
and Gregory (1998) and Hirshel and Rubin (1982) reports that younger and
older adults alike perceive the elderly as vulnerable to crimes.
Fear of crime is accentuated by the fact that many elderly persons live alone
and are more likely to be isolated from neighborhood and community groups.
Research suggests that self-protective tendencies of the elderly, such as restrict-
ing their trips in the community to those that are essential, contribute to higher
levels of isolation (Pain 1995; Watson 1991; Yin 1982). The elderly seem to spend
an inordinate amount of time and effort adapting to their increased frailty and
perceived risk of victimization. In fact, fear of crime and victimization is seem-
ingly an integral part of the lives of many older people (McCabe and Gregory
1998), which may account for the perception that the elderly are "easy targets."
Despite the rather extensive body of literature on fear of crime among the
elderly, actual violence against older persons remains poorly understood. This is
in part due to the fact that, until recently, not much attention has been given to
this phenomenon (Bachman et al. 1998; Ferraro 1990; Gelles 1997; Pillemer and
Finkelhor 1988). This lack of attention, in turn, is probably due to the fact that
this type of homicide occurs on an infrequent basis (MacKellar and Yanagishita
1995). In recent years, victimization of persons aged 65 and older constitutes
approximately 5 percent of all homicides (Bureau of Justice Statistics 1994;
1995; 1996; 1997; 1998). As noted previously however, as the number and pro-
portion of elderly in the United States increase, determining which factors influ-
ence the incidence of homicide of the elderly becomes critical for prevention
and other policy reasons. The present study attempts to address these concerns.
Structural and Cultural Influences
Traditionally, aggregate-level research on homicide has sought to explain
levels of lethal violence across geographic units by examining a variety of eco-
logical characteristics thought to influence homicide. As Messner and Rosenfeld
(1999, p. 27) have noted, the rationale behind this approach is that homicides are
not simply "idiosyncratic individual acts of violence," but rather behavior which
is distributed in a patterned manner. Typically, the ecological characteristics
employed in this type of research can be categorized into one of two types:
cultural/subcultural, which involves the influence of values, norms, and beliefs;
and structure, which involves the impact of social positions and the behavioral
expectations attached to them (Messner and Rosenfeld 1999).
4 GREG S. WEAVER ET AL.
Culture, Religion, and Homicide of the Elderly
An important function of culture is to identify and specify appropriate
relations between people. While the meanings attached to culture are numerous,
it can be generally described as a collection of resources or, as suggested by
Swidler (1986), a "tool kit" that can be used in dealing with various social
situations. In that context, Wolfgang and Ferracuti (1967) further maintain
that within any culture, subcultures may develop. Possibly the most commonly
utilized context is regional in basis, with particular emphasis on the so-called
"Southern" culture. The earliest studies of violence in the United States sug-
gested that homicide occurs more frequently in the South (Brearly 1932; Redfield
1880). Since then, a number of studies have attempted to establish a link between
culture and violence, and an expansive body of literature focuses on the notion
that rates of homicide are higher in the South because the culture promotes
attitudes tolerant of violence (e.g., Gastil 1971, 1975; Hackney 1969; Reed
1972; Wolfgang 1958).1
In regard to the elderly, most cultures hold that elders are to be respected
by others and are to be treated accordingly--at least in an ideal sense. Southern
culture is no exception to this rule. As noted by Haber (1989), elderly people
are elevated to a position of respect and honor. Research by Taylor and col-
leagues (1985; 1990) suggests that the South in particular may possess a unique
set of cultural values which encourages familial assistance to the elderly. To the
contrary, however, they are sometimes thought of as a burden because growing
older also results in a corresponding decline in productivity (Luborsky and
McMullen 1999).
When these attitudes toward the elderly are examined within the context of
Southern culture and violence, a number of interesting questions emerge:
Are elderly persons less likely to become homicide victims because of their "respected" status,
or are they at greater risk because they are viewed as a burden? Or, does their position have no
impact on potential victimization?
In short, assessing the influence of Southern culture will help to clarify
whether elderly persons are protected from victimization or if, on the other hand,
elderly persons are thought of as vulnerable and burdensome, in which case they
would be less likely to enjoy the protection afforded by this status. One objective
of this study is to examine the influence of a variable that has been identified as
closely related to, if not a proxy for, Southern culture--conservative Protestant
affiliation. As will be discussed below, it has been suggested that religion and
culture in the South are mutually reinforcing (Stump 1986).
Messner and Rosenfeld (1999) suggest that social institutions can serve as
a conduit between structure and culture, depending on the degree of integration
of those institutions within a culture/subculture. As noted earlier, religion seems
CULTURE, CONTEXT, AND HOMICIDE OF THE ELDERLY 5
to be particularly salient in the South. Several factors are responsible for the
strong connection between religion and culture in this region. For example,
Gastil (1975) notes that the South is the most religious region of the country,
in terms of reported affiliation and in frequency of church attendance. Because
the church serves as a primary reference group for many, its influence on the
socialization process is increased.
More importantly, however, the distinctiveness of religious affiliation in
this region--Conservative Protestantism--accentuates this belief. While regional
differences in terms of religious affiliation are eroding somewhat, Conservative
Protestantism continues to dominate in the South (Corzine, Huff-Corzine, and
Whitt 1999). Both conservative Protestant theology as it evolved in the South
and the culture of the region were influenced greatly by circumstances and
events unique to the area. Conservative Protestant denominations were part-
icularly resistant to liberalization of belief that occurred in more moderate and
liberal denominations, especially in relation to issues such as slavery, modern-
ization, and the evolution/creation debate (Roof and McKinney 1987). In sum,
what is referred to by Gastil (1971, 1975) as a "siege mentality" has resulted. No
doubt, cultural differences are important factors that influence the direction of
causal attributions (Whitt, Corzine, and Huff-Corzine 1995). Of key importance
is the idea that external forces are responsible for negative situations. In particu-
lar, two tenets of conservative Protestant belief are central to the nexus of
religion and culture: First, the Bible is the infallible word of God that should be
interpreted literally; and second, that salvation requires a conversion experience,
the legitimacy of which is ultimately determined by God. Just as the determina-
tion of salvation is external so, too, are attributions for various life events and
experiences. In essence, culture and religion are key macro-level factors that
provide a lens of sorts through which individuals view, interpret, and react to
life events­including negative ones. Accordingly, if culture promotes the notion
that others are to be blamed for misfortune, externally-directed violence is more
likely. Ellison (1991) links religious culture with attitudes toward violence by
suggesting that individuals who view the relationship between God and man as
hierarchical also tend to hold attitudes tolerant of violence. The latter point is a
component of the nexus between culture and homicide as it relates to attribu-
tions of situations (Lupfer, Hopkinson, and Kelley 1988).
In sum, these examples show the utility of attributions as a key element in
the linking of culture and homicide at the macro-level (Corzine et al. 1999). It is
in this manner that Conservative Protestantism promotes notions of external
causality (Unnithan, Huff-Corzine, Corzine, and Whitt 1994; Whitt et al. 1995).
One should not misinterpret this statement as suggesting that Conservative
Protestantism condones murder. To the contrary, these aspects of religious belief
help to develop and reinforce external causality which, if present in a culture
6 GREG S. WEAVER ET AL.
tolerant of violence in certain situations (as is suggested to be the case in the
South), aggression and homicide may be more likely in certain situations if the
ability of religion to act as an agent of social control is weakened.
Routine Activities and Elderly Homicide
Structural analyses of violent crime typically focus on the influence of corre-
lates such as social class, race, gender, and age. However, Messner and Rosenfeld
(1999) suggest that routine activities and opportunity are also important structural
influences, in terms of how these factors facilitate the convergence of offenders,
victims, and guardians. Both Messner and Tardiff (1985) and Nelsen and Huff-
Corzine (1998) suggest that elderly homicide can be a function of routine activit-
ies. As formulated by Cohen and Felson (1979), routine activities refers to the
notion that predatory crime results from the day-to-day activities--both legitimate
and criminal--that take place in a community. More specifically, Cohen and
Felson (1979, p. 589) maintain that direct contact predatory crime is influenced by
the convergence in time and space of motivated offenders, suitable targets, and a
relative lack of guardianship which would otherwise prevent such crime. This
approach would suggest that homicide will occur when the activity patterns of
the victim intersects with those of potential offenders. For the aged, this would
seem to imply that they would be more likely to be killed by a family member,
since the decreased mobility associated with aging often leads to a more restricted
lifestyle, with fewer interpersonal contacts (Messner and Tardiff 1985).
However, a number of other studies suggest that the relatively isolated life-
style of the elderly may make them more prone to homicide victimization associ-
ated with robbery or burglary, particularly in urban areas (Falzon and Davis 1998;
Fox and Levin 1991; Kennedy and Silverman 1990; Nelsen and Huff-Corzine
1998). According to data from the Supplementary Homicide Reports (Fox 1996),
during 1989­1991 (the years under consideration in the present study), robberies
accounted for one in three homicides for persons aged 65 and older.
So while social isolation has generally been associated with lower levels of
victimization, in this case it may actually serve as a liability because an isolated
older person may be perceived as being a more convenient target by potential
offenders. Moreover, while a younger person might recover from an attack, the
elderly victim may be at greater risk of death. This higher risk of theft-related
homicide is likely related to their lifestyle and being perceived as convenient
targets (Nelsen and Huff-Corzine 1998). In that regard, one could argue that fear
of crime among the elderly is reflected more accurately by the actual risks to
which they as a group are exposed to than has generally been presumed.
When viewed from the routine activities perspective, these seemingly
divergent findings suggest two potential offender pools. The first would suggest
that homicides of the elderly are more likely to occur at the hands of family
CULTURE, CONTEXT, AND HOMICIDE OF THE ELDERLY 7
members, particularly spouses and children--which would imply that offenders
are older than what is typically seen for homicide in general. The second
offender pool suggested by the research of Nelsen and Huff-Corzine (1998) would
implicate a younger age group, more consistent with the traditional profile for
predatory homicide offenders. The present study will examine both in an attempt
to clarify this apparent discrepancy.
Going Beyond Culture versus Structure
The previous sections provide examples of what has been in the eyes of
some a distraction in the study of homicide at the aggregate level: the culture
versus structure debate. Specifically, much discussion has centered on whether
regional variation is due to cultural forces, structural factors, or both. As men-
tioned previously, both Hackney (1969) and Gastil (1971) suggest that homicide
occurs more frequently in the South as a consequence of a regional subculture
that is tolerant of or conducive to violence in particular situations (e.g., in
defense of property or when one's "honor" has been challenged).
On the other hand, Loftin and Hill (1974) revisited these studies and
concluded that by including variables for economic and educational deprivation,
the influence of a Southern regional variable (which should not be confused with
Southern culture) is reduced. A number of other studies have drawn similar
conclusions. For example, using state-level data, Smith and Parker (1980) sug-
gest that the influence of region on primary and secondary homicide is decreased
when structural variables are included. Allen and Bankston (1981) draw similar
conclusions based on their study of homicide in Louisiana, where distinct cul-
tural differences between parishes having similar structural attributes are present.
Furthermore, studies by Blau (Blau and Blau 1982; Blau and Golden 1986)
emphasize how controlling for economic inequality reduces the influence of the
Southern variable.
Since then, numerous studies have supported arguments in favor of cul-
tural, structural, or both sets of factors (see Land, McCall, and Cohen 1990;
Sampson and Lauritsen 1994; Whitt et al. 1995 for additional discussion). The
aforementioned studies are but a few examples of the large body of research that
has contributed to the culture versus structure debate. The seminal work of Land
and colleagues (1990) in some ways reframed this debate by suggesting that
these explanations are not mutually exclusive. Following an exhaustive review
of research, the authors via principal components analysis identify two categories
of variables consistently related to homicide at the aggregate level: population
composition and resource affluence/deprivation. In doing so, a number of diver-
gent findings are at least in part resolved, which illustrates the utility of not
viewing one category as being more important than the other. This suggestion is
consistent with Messner (1983), who found South/Non-South differences when
8 GREG S. WEAVER ET AL.
including race/region interaction terms. Furthermore, while not discussed here, a
key element of the integrated model of Whitt and colleagues (Unnithan et al.
1994; Whitt et al. 1995) is the notion that structural and cultural variables
influence both the level and direction of lethal violence.
Methods and Data
The previous discussion suggests at least two potential scenarios pertaining
to homicide of the elderly: 1) Elderly persons may be vulnerable to attacks of a
predatory nature, particularly in the context of a robbery. If elderly persons are
viewed as a vulnerable target, the likelihood of homicide during a robbery may
actually increase via the potential for physical injury. 2) However, to the extent
that elderly persons are viewed with respect and are treated accordingly, such
attacks may be decreased. Attitudes toward the elderly can influence how older
persons are treated by acquaintances, friends, and family members.
The present study seeks to clarify this potential discrepancy in the literature
by identifying the influence of situational and cultural factors associated with
homicide of the elderly, controlling for those structural factors consistently
found to be related to homicide in general. Specifically, the relevance of cultural
factors (as expressed in conservative Protestant affiliation) will be explored,
controlling for various contexts related to the victim/offender/guardian nexus.
In that regard, a key element exists in the nature of the relationship between
religion and the killing of older persons.
As homicide of the elderly is a relatively rare event, one concern is that a
majority of US counties did not experience any offenses between 1989­1991,
the time period under consideration in the present study. As opposed to calculat-
ing an elderly homicide rate for each county, we instead elect to use the actual
frequency of homicide. There are several methodological concerns which led us
to this decision. As Osgood has noted (Osgood 2000; Osgood and Chambers
2001), ordinary least squares (OLS) regression techniques may be inappropriate
when the rate of a phenomenon is calculated from a relatively small number of
events. Moreover, if the geographic unit being examined is relatively small (i.e.,
with a population of a few thousand), a single occurrence of an event can result
in a large increase in the calculated rate. Of course, when matched with the rate
of a larger geographic unit, the comparison could be misleading. Moreover, the
variability of population sizes across counties could result in violating the OLS
assumption of homogeneity of error variance. There is also the possibility that as
populations decrease a rate of zero will occur with some frequency, thus violat-
ing the normality assumption (Osgood 2000).
In addressing the problem that homicide of the elderly is an infrequent
event, the present study will utilize negative binomial regression, a technique
suitable for rare events (Long 1997). Negative binomial regression is a form of
CULTURE, CONTEXT, AND HOMICIDE OF THE ELDERLY 9
Poisson regression, designed for the use of count data, and does not assume the
homogeneity of error variance. The negative binomial variant is better suited for
the overdispersion of the difference between fitted and observed data (Osgood
2000; Osgood and Chambers 2001). Preliminary analysis (not shown) indicates
the appropriateness of this technique for the models discussed later.2
Dependent variable
The dependent variable utilized in this study is the 1989 to 1991 sum of
homicide victimizations of persons aged 65 and older. This measure allows for a
more accurate representation of deaths in a given county, such as when in a
single year, a location experiences an unusually high level of homicide. Like-
wise, a county may uncharacteristically report no elderly homicides for a single
year. Data for this variable are obtained from respective 1989, 1990, and 1991
Vital Statistics reports (National Center for Health Statistics 1991; 1992; 1993).
Independent variables
The primary measure of culture utilized in this study is percent of the
population affiliated with a conservative Protestant denomination. Identification
of conservative Protestant denominations follows the classification of Roof and
McKinney (1987), which includes belief in a literal interpretation of the Bible
and the necessity of a conversion experience for salvation. Percent of the county
population affiliated with any church is included, based on the finding of Stark,
Doyle, and Kent (1980) who assert that overall level of religiosity/secularization
in a given area influences conformity. In essence, the extent to which the church
acts as a mechanism of social control is potentially greater in those counties where
attendance is higher. Both religion variables are obtained from the 1990 Churches
and Church Membership in the United States study (Bradley et al. 1992), to date
the most comprehensive survey of church membership in the United States.
Defining what constitutes the region known as the South has proven rather
elusive. Perhaps Garreau (1981) is correct in his assertion that its boundaries are
defined primarily by emotion. "The South" evokes images of not only a geo-
graphical area but of a regional subculture as well. In some respects, identifica-
tion with Southern culture has replaced ethnic loyalties (Reed 1972; Roof and
McKinney 1987). Not surprisingly, a number of measures have been utilized in
previous studies. For example, dichotomous indicators for the Confederacy and
the US Census Bureau designation, or percent of the county population born in
the South have been utilized (Ellison 1991; Whitt et al. 1995). The present study
includes a dichotomous measure (coded 1 and 0, respectively) to indicate whether
the county is located in one of the former Confederate states.3
In many cases homicide of the elderly occurs in situations that begin as
robberies and, due to many of the issues outlined previously, the likelihood of
10 GREG S. WEAVER ET AL.
death increases. Recall that studies by both Nelsen and Huff-Corzine (1998) and
Falzon and Davis (1998) reveal the link between robbery and homicide of older
persons--particularly in urban locations. Thus, the analyses that follow include
the 1990 robbery rate for each county. This information is derived from the
Uniform Crime Reports for 1990 (Federal Bureau of Investigation 1990). Also,
a dichotomous variable indicating whether or not the county is situated in a
metropolitan area (coded 1 and 0, respectively) is included.
Additional measures are included to assess key elements of the routine
activities theory in relation to the occurrence of homicide of the elderly, particu-
larly in relation to the presence (or absence) of offenders and guardians. As
noted previously, the issue of vulnerability is of extreme importance in homicide
of the elderly, regardless of whether offenses occur in the context of felonies or
in relation to increased interaction with others. Four separate models related to
potential offenders, victims, and guardians will be examined in this study. The
first measure utilized is percent of the county population aged 65 and older. The
second model includes a measure for the percent of households headed by a
single person who is 65 years or older. These two measures will be included in
separate equations to assess how the presence of vulnerable targets is related to
elderly homicide. Data for both variables are obtained from the 1990 Census.
Additional models are included to assess the influence of the potential
offender population and/or guardians. Recall that routine activities theory sug-
gests two alternatives in regard to the nature of homicide of the elderly: On the
one hand, some studies have shown that homicide of this group often occurs in
the context of a robbery or other crime, whereas other research suggests that
homicide occurs at the hands of family members or other persons who provide
care or assistance. Consequently, interaction with others could either increase or
decrease the risk of homicide. This study includes two such measures: percent
of the population between the ages of 15 and 29; and second, percent of the
county population between 40 and 59 years of age. The former is included as a
measure of potential offenders and the latter measure is employed as a means of
assessing potential contact with persons younger than the offender (such as
spouses, children, and other caregivers). These variables, also included in separ-
ate models, will assist in clarifying the situations in which these incidents occur.
That is, how does the presence of potential offenders and/or guardians influence
the occurrence of homicide of the elderly? According to the Supplemental Homi-
cide Reports (Fox 1996), for 1989 to 1991 these two age categories accounted
for 41.4 and 17.8 percent, respectively, of elderly homicides in which the age
of the offender is known.
As stated previously, Land and colleagues (1990), in an exhaustive review
and analysis of research focusing on structural correlates of homicide, identified
two primary categories of variables that are consistently related to homicide:
CULTURE, CONTEXT, AND HOMICIDE OF THE ELDERLY 11
population composition and resource affluence/deprivation. Structural variables
employed in this study are based upon this research. Population measures con-
sist of the 1990 county population and density, along with the percent of the
population that is African American, each transformed into natural logarithm
form and included as a summed scale. Resource affluence/deprivation variables
include the percent of the county population in poverty in 1990, percent of
children living in single-parent families headed by a female, and the Gini index
of inequality. These data were obtained from the 1990 Census. Please note that
the states of Alaska and Hawaii are excluded from the following analyses.
Findings
Table 1 presents the analyses that separately employ the respective meas-
ures related to elderly population composition. Model A includes percent of the
county population aged 65 and older which, although in the expected direction,
is not significantly related to the dependent variable. However, Model A indi-
cates that even when controlling for the 1990 robbery rate, metropolitan area
and Southern location, both religion variables are significantly related to the
elderly homicide count. Homicide of the elderly is associated with increased
conservative Protestant and lower overall church affiliation. With the exception
of percent in poverty, the remaining control variables are significant and are
related to the dependent variable as anticipated. Model B of Table 1 employs the
variable that measures the proportion of households headed by a single person
aged 65 and older. Likewise, this variable is not significantly related to the
dependent variable and furthermore, the direction of the association changes.
With the exception of the Confederate variable decreasing in influence, the
findings are virtually identical to that found in the previous model. Once again,
the key religion variables are related to homicide of the elderly as expected.
The Pseudo-R2 for A and B indicate that a moderate proportion of variance is
explained by the respective models.
Table 2 presents those models focusing specifically on how the potential
presence of offenders and/or guardians is related to homicide of the elderly.
Model C includes the percent of the population aged 40 to 59. From the previous
discussion, recall that various studies suggest the possibility that persons in this
age group (be they acquaintances, children, or other caretakers) may comprise
either potential offenders or guardians. In this instance, it appears that persons in
this age group serve neither function to a great degree. The fact that the relation-
ship is negative, however, suggests the possibility that members of this category
are more likely to be potential guardians as opposed to offenders. Similar to
the previous findings, both religion variables are significant and in the expected
direction as is the case for the 1990 robbery rate, population index, and other
key control variables.

Model D of Table 2 includes percent between the ages of 15 and 29.
Homicide of the elderly is significantly and negatively related to this variable, a
somewhat surprising finding given the propensity of elder homicides to occur in
the context of a robbery and that offenders are more likely to be younger. While
inclusion of this variable does not affect the overall model to a great extent, key
differences are evident. In this instance percent in poverty becomes significant,
even though it appears that across the four models, inequality as reflected in the
Gini index is more strongly related to elder homicide. That inequality, as opposed
to absolute deprivation, is more consistently associated with homicide is consist-
ent with the findings of Blau and Blau (1982). Likewise, in this instance the
Confederacy variable is positive and significant. As in the previous examples,
both religion variables remain significant and in the expected direction.
Discussion and Conclusion
This study examines two important issues related to homicide of the elderly--
the impact of Southern culture and religion, as well as elaborating the situational
context of these events. In doing so, questions pertaining to the relationship
between Southern culture/religion and homicide are addressed by assessing the
influence of conservative Protestant and overall church affiliation. Secondly, this
study attempts to reconcile the seemingly disparate findings of previous studies
as to the victim/offender relationships associated with elderly homicide. Various
studies suggest that homicide of the elderly is associated with robbery or that
it is more likely to occur at the hands of family members or other caregivers.
By addressing these questions simultaneously, the contribution of one category
can be assessed when controlling for others. In this instance, doing so reveals
that both cultural and structural factors are important considerations (similar to
the contention of Unnithan et al. [1994] that the respective arguments are not
mutually exclusive).
It has been argued that Conservative Protestantism is an influence on and
likewise reflects key elements of Southern culture, one in which elderly persons
are believed to be held in particular esteem. Does this culture, then, insulate or
protect the elderly from homicide? In a word, no. At the county level, elderly
homicide is positively related to percent affiliated with a conservative Protestant
denomination and Southern region suggesting, contrary to the suggestions of
Taylor (1985) that even in a cultural setting that purports to hold these individu-
als in high regard, they continue to be at a greater risk.
However, clarification of this apparent relationship is necessary. While homi-
cide of the elderly is positively related to conservative Protestant affiliation and
Southern region, it is also negatively related to percent affiliated with any reli-
gion. This finding suggests that homicide of the elderly is more likely to occur in
counties--particularly urban ones--where the influence of Southern culture is
CULTURE, CONTEXT, AND HOMICIDE OF THE ELDERLY 15
greater, coupled with the lack of a social control offered by religion generally. In
short, the overall lower levels of religious affiliation is evidence of weakened
boundaries on behavior in a cultural setting that is more tolerant of violence in
particular situations. The consistency of this relationship between conservative
Protestant affiliation and elderly homicide across all models tested is noteworthy,
given that the influence of important contextual and structural factors is controlled.
The second area of emphasis focuses on the contextual factors associated
with homicide of the elderly. Given the aforementioned discussion as to the
extent to which robbery is a key motive/circumstance, it is not surprising that
the relationship between the robbery rate and elderly homicide is positive and
significant across all models tested. Furthermore, the analyses presented here
suggest that when robbery is compared with specific age distribution variables
that reflect the presence (or lack thereof) of potential offenders, victims, and
guardians, the former is more relevant. Therefore, it appears that risk of victimiz-
ation is related to increased vulnerability associated with old age. While elderly
homicide is positively related to an older population, it appears that living alone
does not increase the risk. That percent aged 40 to 59 is negatively (but not
significantly) related to elderly homicide implies these individuals are more apt
to act as guardians as opposed to potential offenders. Thus, these findings are
consistent with the conclusions drawn by a number of studies that illuminate the
importance of robbery and/or burglary (e.g., Falzon and Davis 1998; Fox and
Levin 1991; Kennedy and Silverman 1990; Nelsen and Huff-Corzine 1998).
From a policy standpoint however, because isolation apparently does not in-
crease the likelihood of victimization, the issue of vulnerability as it relates to
victimization by relatives or other acquaintances is of utmost concern.
In some ways, the finding that homicide of the elderly is negatively related
to percent of the population aged 15 to 29 is surprising. Ellison (1991) offers a
potential explanation for this finding that is particularly relevant to the nexus
between culture, religion, and homicide. According to Ellison, the influence
of Southern culture is greater among older persons and the relationship between
age and support for violence is positive. Therefore, it appears that homicide
of the elderly is likewise a function of the association between victims and
potential offenders--in many cases spouses, children, and other acquaintances
who are in closer proximity to the age of the victim. Regardless of the age of the
offender, elderly victims are more vulnerable to serious injury that may result in
death. Identifying the age distribution of offenders in relation to the age of the
victim would assist in clarifying this relationship. Specifically, is robbery of the
elderly more likely to occur at the hands of an older (but not elderly) person or
are elderly persons targeted by young persons?
Future research should focus on further specifying the situational dynamics
related to lethal violence involving elderly victims, particularly in regard to
16 GREG S. WEAVER ET AL.
examining the age distribution of offenders. An additional area not pursued in
this study involves the question of whether firearm availability influences homi-
cide of the elderly. This question is particularly intriguing, given that homicide
of the elderly frequently occurs in the context of a robbery and that on average,
approximately 500,000 firearms are stolen annually (Cook and Moore 1999). How-
ever, this task is complicated because existing measures of firearm availability,
particularly at the county level, are limited at best (Corzine, Huff-Corzine, and
Weaver 2000). Nonetheless, addressing this question can assist in identifying
those measures that will potentially reduce the risk of victimization for this
vulnerable group.

1Preliminary analyses (not shown) reveal that the rate of elderly homicide in the former Con-
federate states exceeds that of non-Confederate states considerably (2.70 versus .9420 per 100,000).
2The alpha coefficients for all models were statistically significant (p < .001), indicating the
appropriateness of the negative binomial procedure. Osgood (2000) and Osgood and Chambers
(2001) note that the dependent variable in negative binomial regression models can be interpreted as
a rate if an offset term (population at risk) is included in the equation. However, because this study
examines percent of the county population aged 65 and older as an element of routine activities/
opportunity, this variation of the negative binomial procedure is not employed.
3As noted by Whitt et al. (1995) a Confederacy variable excludes from the South the states of
Kentucky, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, all of which are arguably similar, culturally speaking, to
the Southern region. Alternatively, the Census Bureau designation of the Southern region includes
the states of Maryland and Delaware, as well as the District of Columbia--areas whose respective
cultures more closely resemble that of the Northeast than the South. These concerns notwithstand-
ing, we elected to incorporate the former measure, due in part to potential multicollinearity between
percent of the county born in the South and percent of the county population affiliated with a
conservative Protestant denomination.
