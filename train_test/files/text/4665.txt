The diversity of the 113th US Congress's freshman class
received immediate attention (Parker, 2013; Sands, 2013).
Twenty-four women were newly elected to Congress in
2012, bringing women's representation to a record 18%.1
But this number masks a striking partisan disparity: 20 of
the 24 new women members of Congress are Democrats,
highlighting a trend that extends across many offices, with
76% of all women in Congress and 64% of all women in
US state legislatures in 2013 holding office as Democrats
(CAWP, 2013a, 2013b). While this party gap has been
noted before (Elder, 2008, 2012; Palmer and Simon, 2001;
Sanbonmatsu, 2006), questions remain about when and
why it emerged, and whether it is likely to persist in the
future.
In this research note, we begin with the previously docu-
mented fact that a partisan disparity in women representa-
tives in the US House emerged in the 1980s and has
continued to grow in magnitude (Elder, 2008). We propose
an explanation for this gap by demonstrating that this pat-
tern closely mirrors the contemporaneous emergence of a
partisan disparity in the proportion of women among the
American public with the typical characteristics of newly
elected high-level officeholders: highly educated individu-
als in their late 40s, employed in fields with high occupa-
tional prestige (Carnes, 2012). To estimate the historical
gender composition of this small and particular set of citi-
zens from survey data, we use a nonparametric regression
approach that has not previously been applied in this area of
research. Our analysis indicates that the proportion of
women in the Democratic pool of potential candidates is
now two to three times larger than that in the Republican
pool. The relationship between party identification, gender,
and social and demographic characteristics suggests this
gap is more likely to increase than decrease over the com-
ing decade. Given previous findings, such trends can be
expected to reshape the bills proposed and passed by each
party's legislators (Carroll, 2001; Swers, 2002, 2013;
Thomas, 1994) and influence public opinion of the parties
as each party draws on the officials in their caucus to reach
out to voters (Swers, 2013).

Abstract
A partisan disparity in women representatives in the US House emerged in the 1980s and has continued to grow in
magnitude. We show that this pattern closely mirrors the emergence of a partisan disparity in the proportion of women
in the US public with the typical characteristics of high-level officeholders. Our analysis indicates that the proportion of
women in the Democratic pool of potential candidates is now two to three times larger than in the Republican pool of
potential candidates. Given the current association of party identification with gender and other characteristics, this gap
is more likely to increase than decrease over the coming decade, with potential consequences for the descriptive and
substantive representation of women in American politics.

for and supply of women candidates. On the demand side,
some have proposed that differences in party elite ideolo-
gies may contribute to the gap in women's officeholding in
these parties (Elder, 2012). Growing distinctions between
the parties on issues of gender ­ exemplified by party state-
ments on women's role in society and policy stances affect-
ingwomen'sabilitytoworkoutsidethehome(Sanbonmatsu,
2002a; Wolbrecht, 2000) ­may signal that Republican
elites are less likely than Democratic elites to encourage
women to seek public office (Fox and Lawless, 2010). The
prevalence of the Christian Right in the Republican party
also hinders the demand for Republican women candidates,
while the support of women's groups particularly enhances
Democratic women's representation (Elder, 2012). These
findings are consistent with research demonstrating that
internationally, leftist parties typically run more women
candidates than rightist parties, due in part to the egalitarian
ideology more common in left-wing parties (Caul, 1999;
Lovenduski and Norris, 1993). Furthermore, at least in
advanced democracies, populations with more egalitarian
cultures and greater openness to women's leadership ­
views more common among left than right party identifiers
­ are more likely to elect women to political office (Inglehart
and Norris, 2003; Matland, 1998).
Our analysis focuses on the supply of Democratic and
Republican women candidates. Since 1980, women have
demonstrated a preference for the Democratic party, sup-
porting Democratic candidates and identifying as
Democrats at higher rates than men (Box-Steffensmeier
et al., 2004; CAWP, 2008). This gender gap may influence
the supply of women candidates available to each party,
because women's presence as party activists is positively
correlated with their presence as elected officials in a num-
ber of nations (Caul, 1999; Sainsbury 1993). However, the
differences in party identification by gender in theAmerican
public at large are insufficient to explain a much larger gap
between Democratic and Republican women's representa-
tion in political office. Thus, some have turned to narrower
measures of the supply of political candidates to explain the
party gap among female officeholders.
Several studies have focused on the supply of working
women in the electorate and suggested that pools of women
candidates differ by party. Women's presence in the labor
force has a greater effect on women's representation as
Democratic than Republican state legislators (Elder, 2012;
Sanbonmatsu, 2002c), likely because, as a 2001 survey
reveals, a larger proportion of women in education, law,
and activism professions are Democrats than Republicans
(Lawless and Fox, 2010).2 Focusing on the supply of candi-
dates with political experience, Elder (2008) also notes that
there are significantly more Democratic than Republican
women state legislators. Although adherence to traditional
gender roles has waned among both Republican and
Democratic women (Sanbonmatsu, 2002a), any remaining
differences in views about women's role in society between
women partisans may contribute to these differences in
labor force patterns and influence the supply of women
potential candidates. The relative prevalence of women
among partisans matters, not because parties could not
identify a sufficient number of women candidates if gender
balance were prioritized in candidate selection, but because
without such efforts the gender composition of representa-
tives will reflect the populations from which successful
candidates are drawn.
We develop a measure of the supply of women candi-
dates that goes beyond those considered in previous work
in several ways. First, we focus our attention not on all
women in the workforce, but specifically on women with
high educational attainment working in the kinds of occu-
pations that one typically finds on a congressional candi-
date's resumé.3 Second, we focus on strong partisans, to
address the fact that even a well-educated person in a pres-
tigious occupation is unlikely to run if they do not have a
clear preference between the two parties. Existing studies
that examine the supply of women in the candidate pool
note that political activism is an important determinant of
recruitment to candidacy (e.g. Lawless and Fox, 2010), but
do not construct their sample of the candidate pool based on
strength of party identification. Third, we examine the dis-
tribution of men and women among individuals with these
elite, partisan characteristics, recognizing that men and
women may be distributed differently by party within this
subset than they are in the broader population. Finally, and
most importantly, we estimate the gender composition of
this pool of potential candidates over a period of four dec-
ades by drawing on the General Social Survey, a long-
running, nationally representative survey. This enables us
to explain past changes in women's office holding by party
and make projections into the near future. Existing studies
have provided helpful detail regarding women's presence
in key feeder professions for political candidacy, but such
nuance comes at the cost of being able to look back in time
and examine the relationship between the supply of women
candidates and their election to public office as it emerged
through US political history and is likely to proceed going
forward. Previous research has indicated that more women
Democrats than Republicans are state legislators, educa-
tors, lawyers, and activists (Elder, 2008; Lawless and Fox,
2010). Our analysis pinpoints the moment in history when
this party gap emerged and highlights that it exists in a
broader population than these previous studies have
indicated.
Data and method
To estimate how the pool of potential candidates has
evolved in terms of gender composition, we used the cumu-
lative file of the General Social Survey (GSS) from 1972 to
2010. The GSS is the largest survey over this period that
includes self-reported party identification as well as age,
Crowder-Meyer and Lauderdale 3
birth year, education, work status and occupational pres-
tige.4 Our aim was to estimate how the gender composition
of the pool of potential candidates for each party evolved
over time, as birth cohorts with varying profiles of educa-
tion, occupation and partisanship by gender passed through
the ages that are typical of new members of Congress. New
representatives are typically between 35 and 60, have col-
lege and usually some post-graduate education, are
employed in a high status occupation and are strong parti-
sans (Manning, 2011; McCarty et al., 2006).
Unfortunately we cannot estimate the gender composi-
tion of the candidate pool simply by looking at the gender
composition of individuals who meet all of these criteria. In
the entire GSS time series, out of roughly 55,000 respond-
ents, only 482 were strong partisans, aged 35-60, with 16 or
more years of education and jobs in the top 10% of occupa-
tional prestige.5 Thus, simple cross-tabulation is not an
attractive approach to estimate how gender balance has
evolved by birth cohort for Democratic versus Republican
identifiers.
Instead, we propose a new method to estimate the gen-
der composition of the pool of candidates. We fit regression
models with gender of the GSS respondent as the depend-
ent variable. This kind of specification is unusual, but
appropriate here because we want to estimate a conditional
probability without any claim as to the underlying process
that generated the relationships in the data.6 We aim to esti-
mate the probability of a citizen being female, conditional
on that citizen having the demographic and political char-
acteristics typical of new representatives. By using regres-
sion modeling to estimate these conditional probabilities,
we can leverage the gender composition of individuals who
have most of the attributes we are interested in order to help
estimate the gender composition of individuals who have
all of these attributes.
A potential disadvantage is that our regression model
might assume too much, imposing relationships on the data
that lead to misleading inferences about the peculiar group
of individuals that we are interested in. We address this risk
by constructing our estimates using the nonparametric
method of local logistic regression (Wasserman, 2006: 96­
99), which assumes that the log-odds of being female vary
linearly as a function of birth cohort, age, occupational
prestige and education, but only for values of these varia-
bles near the values of interest. The local regression is
achieved by means of kernel weighting that puts more
weight on respondents whose characteristics more closely
resemble those for whom we want to estimate composition
by gender. In the supplemental appendix, we provide the
exact GSS question wordings and our variable codings, an
explanation of why local logistic regression is superior to
GLM and GAM regressions in this application, an explana-
tion of how we used cross-validation to choose kernel
bandwidths, and a relatively imprecise analysis of the same
data using cross-tabulation. Using our approach, we can
estimate the proportion of women among Americans with
the typical (non-gender) characteristics of a potential candi-
date for the US House at a given point in time. The analysis
we present focuses on 48 year-old, employed strong parti-
sans with 18 years of education at the 97.5 percentile of
occupational prestige. The relevant features of the trends
we estimate are, however, robust to moderately changing
these values.
We also computed local logistic regression estimates of
the rate at which each party elected women to the US House
over the same period, 1972­2012. We constructed data on
turnover in House seats from the cumulative ICPSR code
file for the roll call database maintained by Keith Poole.7
From these data, we found the number of new members of
Congress across all states in each year, indicating the num-
ber of turnover and seat creation events.8 We constructed a
list of every woman who has ever served in the House and
linked this to the ICPSR code file to determine when each
woman was initially elected. This yielded a data set of 1501
newly elected members of Congress over 21 elections, with
the year, party and gender for each. For both local logistic
regression analyses ­ on the pool of potential candidates
and on the newly elected representatives ­ we calculate
95% pointwise confidence bands around our estimates via
1000 bootstrap replications.
Results
Figure 1 shows the evolution of gender composition within
the estimated pool of potential candidates and the evolution
of gender composition of newly elected members of
Congress, for Democrats and Republicans. While the trends
are not identical, they are strikingly similar in several
respects.
In the early 1970s, the proportion of women in the pool
of potential candidates for each party was similar, less than
10% of the total pool for each party. Women's presence in
the pool of candidates increased as they entered feeder pro-
fessions in higher numbers, but unequally between the par-
ties. By 1990 there were twice as many women in the
Democratic pool of candidates as the Republican pool, a
difference maintained over the subsequent two decades as
both pools of candidates gained more women proportion-
ately. In 2012, the model estimates that women composed
56% of the Democratic pool and 26% of the Republican
pool. Our model-based extrapolations become very uncer-
tain by 2020, but the evidence based on GSS respondents
currently younger than our target age of 48 indicates that
the partisan gender gap is increasing rather than decreasing
in younger cohorts.
The proportion of women among newly elected repre-
sentatives has followed a similar pattern. A gap between the
two parties appeared around 1980, reached a 2:1 ratio
around 1990, and has continued to drift upward subse-
quently. The 2012 estimates are 30% for Democrats and
4 Research and Politics 
11% for Republicans, similar to actual figures in that elec-
tion of 31% (16 out of 52) and 9% (3 out of 35), respec-
tively. While these new representative rates follow the
same historical patterns of growth among Democrats and
stagnation among Republicans, they are consistently and
substantially lower than our estimates of the proportion of
women in the pool of candidates.
Note also that 1992­the `Year of the Woman' (Berch,
1996; Cook et al., 1994; Dolan, 1998) ­ is the only recent
year where the proportion of women elected matched the
absolute level of women in our estimated pool of candi-
dates. The new Democratic cohorts elected in 1972 and
1992 are outliers in the sense that our estimated trend in the
rate at which women are elected is outside the 95% confi-
dence interval based on those elections alone. However,
since there are 42 party-election-years in the data, two such
outliers is what we would expect to see by chance. Thus,
there is a limit to how strongly we should interpret these
years in terms of the underlying processes that generate
new congressional cohorts, even though they are notewor-
thy in terms of their outcomes.
Discussion and conclusion
The gender composition of our estimated pool of candi-
dates for Democrats and Republicans closely matches the
historical trends in women's emergence in the US House.
While this does not necessarily imply that this diverging
supply of women is the only explanation for the diverging
proportions of women among Democratic and Republican
members of Congress, it does provide a straightforward
explanation for this aspect of the historical trends.
One striking pattern in these estimates is that the propor-
tion of women in the potential Republican candidate pool
seems to have plateaued. Given that the partisan gap among
newly elected women representatives is already approach-
ing three to one, this indicates the possibility of an increas-
ingly stark discrepancy between the parties, with a
Democratic caucus approaching gender parity and a
Republican caucus that remains overwhelmingly male.
Because research indicates that women's presence in
office affects policymaking and voters in a variety of ways
(e.g. Atkeson, 2003; Carroll, 2001; Osborn, 2012; Swers,
2002, 2013; Thomas, 1994), this growing distinction
between the parties may have significant effects on the par-
ties'platforms, legislative priorities and appeals to the elec-
torate. For example, our research suggests that the
Republican Party's increasing desire to `develop a surro-
gate list of women' to reach out to voters, and to focus on
`encouraging and championing [women's] desire to seek
elective office' (Republican National Committee, 2013:
20­21) may be hindered by the supply of Republican
women with the typical characteristics of political candi-
dates. The additional effort needed to identify women in a
pool where they are substantially outnumbered by men may
limit the extent to which the Republican party draws on
even the supply of women partisans currently available.
Thus our findings highlight the need for continuing research
examining the causes of this party gap.
To the extent that this gap is driven by differing gender
norms among Republicans and Democrats ­ whether due to
women's selection of a party that matches their gender
views, or women's shifting of their gender role beliefs to
match those of the party with which they affiliate ­ the

supply of women candidates from within the Republican
electorate may expand only following extensive changes in
the ideology of the Republican party more broadly. Studies
have revealed shifts of this nature occurring internationally,
with more egalitarian gender norms expanding beyond left-
ist parties over time (Lovenduski and Norris, 1993; Matland
and Studlar, 1996). In the US, however, time trends in
responses to GSS questions about gender roles are ambigu-
ous as to whether the differences between Democratic and
Republican partisans are narrowing or not since the 1980s.9
In fact, polarization of US parties on these issues may pre-
vent the spread of egalitarianism across parties from occur-
ring in the same way as in other nations. While positions on
social and cultural issues such as gender equity were previ-
ously minimally correlated with party identification in the
US in the 1980s and 1990s, Democratic and Republican
elites polarized on these issues, and they became part of the
profile of disagreements distinguishing the parties (Adams,
1997; Wolbrecht, 2000). Since this time, Democratic and
Republican elites have continued to polarize on these and
related social issues (Hetherington, 2010) and their views
have extended to many mass party identifiers (Layman and
Carsey, 2002). Thus while further liberalizing of gender
views in the US could bring American women's political
representation closer to women's representation in other
advanced democracies by expanding the supply of women
in the pool of candidates, polarization and conflict exten-
sion may limit this movement within the Republican party,
leading to growth rather than narrowing of the party gap in
the supply of women potential candidates in the US.
The other prominent disparity in these estimates is
between the gender composition of high education, high
prestige, middle aged partisans and the gender composition
of those who are actually elected.10 Although women now
comprise a majority of those in our estimated pool of
Democratic potential candidates, and a significant minority
of Republican potential candidates, women's representa-
tion as members of Congress remains far lower. While a
qualification gap between men and women may have been
important before the post Title IX generation of women hit
middle age in the 1990s, it cannot easily explain the differ-
ence in levels between the two plots in Figure 1. Many
studies demonstrate similarities in the qualifications and
campaign competencies of men and women candidates
(Burrell, 1994; Carroll, 1994; Gaddie and Bullock III,
1995; Werner, 1997). Instead, the gap may be driven by fac-
tors like differential recruitment (Crowder-Meyer, 2013;
Fox and Lawless, 2010; Sanbonmatsu, 2002c, 2006;
Stambough and O'Regan, 2007), ambition (Lawless and
Fox, 2010), voter biases or stereotypes (Fulton, 2012;
Sanbonmatsu, 2002b; though see Brooks, 2013; Dolan,
2013), or some other force driving down the proportion of
eligible women actually running for and taking office.
Whatever factors explain the difference between the two
plots may also affect women in the two parties differently
­ particularly if different gender norms among Republicans
and Democrats depress Republican women's political
ambition, recruitment by elites, or votes from the elector-
ate. So, while our projections indicate that the partisan gen-
der gap in the US House is more likely to widen than not,
changes in these other factors could reshape this gap in the
future.
Previous studies demonstrating single digit gender gaps
in US party identification have not been able to explain the
much larger gap when it comes to US elected officials. But
representatives do not emerge from the public at large:
they are disproportionately individuals with high educa-
tion, high occupational prestige, and clear partisan prefer-
ences. By estimating the gender composition of this select
group by partisanship, we find that the partisan gender gap
is much larger among the kinds of citizens who tend to
become representatives and that the emergence of this gap
was contemporaneous with the historical emergence of a
partisan gender gap in the US House. Given the current
associations between gender, partisanship, and other attrib-
utes among the public, the data suggest that future genera-
tional replacement may exacerbate the already significant
gap in women's descriptive representation between the
parties, potentially reshaping the behavior of each party's
elected officials, the quality of representation available to
diverse members of the public, and opinions of the public
toward the Republican and Democratic parties.

Notes
1. This still falls below levels of women's representation
in parliaments worldwide, which average 21.8% female
(Interparliamentary Union, 2013).
 2. On the other hand, more women working in business ­ the
fourth field that Lawless and Fox (2010) examine ­ are
Republicans.
3. While gender norms may differ between the Republican
and Democratic parties, the characteristics of successful
candidates for these parties do not. For example, a 2008
survey of state legislators reveals that very few (3.5% of
representatives, 4.9% of senators) female legislators were
6 Research and Politics 
full-time homemakers (Carroll and Sanbonmatsu, 2013).
Consequently, the perception that likely Republican women
candidates might be disproportionately excluded from a
measure of supply that does not include these backgrounds
(Diamond, 1977) is no longer accurate.
 4. The occupational prestige variable is not currently available
for the 2012 GSS, due to a change in occupation codes to
reflect the 2010 Census. See the appendix for details on the
occupational prestige variables from the GSS.
 5. The top decile includes all of the occupations commonly held
by members of Congress prior to entering politics: teachers,
doctors, lawyers, technical professions, accountants and
chief executives.
 6. This approach could also be used to determine the presence of
other underrepresented groups among potential candidates.
7. http://www.voteview.com/icpsr.htm
 8. We ignore special elections, so our definition of a new mem-
ber of Congress is a member who was not elected in the gen-
eral election for the preceding Congress.
 9. See the appendix for details.
10. Some caution is required here though, because our estimation
target is only an approximation of the characteristics of can-
didates. The occupations that rate highly on the GSS prestige
variable may not precisely match the occupations that one or
both parties draw from most heavily. For example, although
recent surveys of American state legislators indicate that very
few candidates in recent years have been elected from the kinds
of backgrounds not captured by our measures (Carroll and
Sanbonmatsu, 2013), some small proportion of women candi-
dates may emerge from working in the home (Baer and Bositis,
1988) ­ not ranked a high prestige occupation. Thus, while the
measures of education, occupational prestige, partisanship and
age allow us to construct a reasonable approximation of the
pool of candidates, other characteristics may also contribute to
the lower rates of women being elected to Congress.
