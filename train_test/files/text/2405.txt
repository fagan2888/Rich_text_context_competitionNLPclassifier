LEGAL CYNICISM AND PARENTAL APPRAISALS OF
ADOLESCENT VIOLENCE
Brian Soller*, Aubrey L. Jackson AND Christopher R. Browning
Research suggests that legal cynicism--a cultural frame in which the law is viewed as illegitimate
and ineffective--encourages violence to maintain personal safety when legal recourse is unreli-
able. But no study has tested the impact of legal cynicism on appraisals of violence. Drawing
from symbolic interaction theory and cultural sociology, we tested whether neighbourhood legal
cynicism alters the extent to which parents appraise their children's violence as indicative of aggres-
sive or impulsive temperaments using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods. We find that legal cynicism attenuates the positive association between adolescent
violence and parental assessments of aggression and impulsivity. Our study advances the under-
standing of micro-level processes through which prevailing cultural frames in the neighbourhood
shape violence appraisals.
Keywords: legal cynicism, cultural frames, adolescent delinquency, neighbourhood
effects
Criminologists increasingly have focused on the consequences of legal cynicism within
neighbourhoods. Legal cynicism refers to the cultural view that the legal system is
illegitimate, inadequately protects against victimization and fails to properly handle
(criminal) offenses. Accordingly, extralegal strategies to resolve disputes or to secure
personal safety should be favoured over legal recourse in legally cynical contexts.
Indeed, higher levels of neighbourhood legal cynicism have been associated with
increased rates of violence (Kirk and Papachristos 2011) and with a decreased likeli-
hood of arrest for juvenile delinquency (Kirk and Matsuda 2011). But apparently no
study has quantitatively assessed whether and how legal cynicism influences appraisals
of violence and aggression, which have been inconsistently associated with adolescent
crime and delinquency across neighbourhoods (Lynam et al. 2000; Zimmerman 2010).
To address this gap in the literature, we investigate whether and how legal cynicism
influences appraisals of adolescents' violent behaviour. Specifically, we test whether the
level of legal cynicism characterizing the residential neighbourhood influences par-
ents' interpretations of their children's violent behaviour as indicative of trait-based
predispositions.
Understanding the factors influencing parental appraisals of violence is important
because it may help explain why the association between parental assessments of trait-
based predispositions and adolescent crime and delinquency is inconsistent across
neighbourhoods. For instance, Lynam et al. (2000) found that among a sample of
boys in Pittsburgh, the positive association between an impulsivity measure--which

combined parent, self, teacher and researcher assessments--and offending was
stronger in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Using data from the Project on Human
Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), Zimmerman (2010) found that
the association between parent reports of impulsivity and adolescent offending was
weakest in neighbourhoods with high levels of legal cynicism. One possible explana-
tion for this variation across neighbourhoods is that assessments of trait-based predis-
positions, such as impulsivity and externalizing behaviour problems, often were based
on parents' interpretations of their children's behaviour (Wareham and Boots 2011).
Importantly, it is possible that parental assessments of trait-based predispositions--
although likely influenced by children's actual behaviour--are systematically biased by
neighbourhood-based cultural frames. Furthermore, according to Kirk and Matsuda
(2011) and Kirk and Papachristos (2011), legal cynicism functions as a cultural frame
that influences interpretations of violent behaviour within larger contexts, such as
neighbourhoods.
To explain how legal cynicism might influence parental appraisals of adoles-
cents' violent behaviour, our theoretical framework focuses on how cultural `frames'
(Goffman 1974; Benford and Snow 2000) inform `role-taking' and appraisal processes
(Matsueda 1992). Based on this approach, we propose legal cynicism shapes appraisals
of violence through a process in which individuals project themselves into the roles
of others and appraise, from their standpoints, the situation, themselves in the situa-
tion and possible lines of action (Mead 1934; Matsueda 1992). Specifically, we argue
that parents residing in legally cynical neighbourhoods--which are characterized by
pervasive views that legal recourse is inadequate--will interpret their children's vio-
lent behaviour as rational, situated behavioural responses to precarious circumstances
rather than as symptoms of trait-based predispositions. Accordingly, we hypothesize
that legal cynicism attenuates the positive association between children's self-reported
violent behaviour and parental assessments of their children's aggression and of a
related temperament--impulsivity--which prominent criminological theories sug-
gest is a trait strongly associated with delinquency (Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990;
Moffitt 1993). We test hypotheses with multilevel statistical models using data from
the PHDCN.
A Focus on Cultural Frames
Much of the recent research concerning the relationship between culture and crime
draws from classical theories of criminal subcultures, which propose that structurally
disadvantaged and socially disorganized neighbourhoods engender deviant systems of
values and norms that sanction violence (Cohen 1955; Cloward and Ohlin 1960; Kubrin
and Weitzer 2003; Stewart and Simons 2006). Accordingly, individuals are thought to
offend primarily because they adopt norms and values that are conducive to violence
from the surrounding cultural context. But research suggests that residents of poor
and disorganized neighbourhoods share values with those from more advantaged and
socially organized communities (Hannerz 1969; Harding 2007). Given the discrepancy
between the propositions of subcultural theories and empirical findings, we instead
employ an alternative and perhaps more fruitful approach to culture that focuses on
`frames' (Goffman 1974; Harding 2007).
LEGAL CYNICISM AND PARENTAL APPRAISALS

According to a framing approach, culture influences action in part through the
provision of cognitive frames that shape individuals' perceptions and understand-
ing of how the world works (Goffman 1974; Berg et al. 2012). Frames condense
and simplify the external world by selectively encoding actions, events and mun-
dane occurrences (Benford and Snow 2000). Frames are behaviourally consequen-
tial because they help individuals identify the practical consequences of various
`strategies of action' (Swidler 1986) within particular contexts or situations (Berg
et al. 2012). Decisions to employ particular victimization-avoidance strategies, e.g.,
are influenced by interpretations of violent contexts and of the perceived conse-
quences of violence. These interpretations are based on past observations, which
were filtered through cultural frames pertaining to violence. Rather than inducing
individuals to adhere to certain norms or values, culture influences action in large
part by informing individuals' interpretations of situations--through the provision
of frames--thereby making violent strategies of action possible and more or less
probable (Lamont and Small 2008; Berg et al. 2012). Importantly, this approach to
culture helps explain why individuals act violently without adhering to a coherent
set of oppositional cultural norms or values as is suggested by subcultural theories
(Harding 2007).
The specific cultural frame we focus on in this study is legal cynicism, which fos-
ters the expectation that legal recourse is unreliable and illegitimate. Given this
interpretation, adolescents' strategies for resolving disputes are constrained to
extralegal forms of social control, such as self-help (Black 1976; 1983). Black (1983)
defines `self-help' strategies as rational, aggressive responses to grievances that may
include violence. Strategies to avoid victimization are especially likely to include
violence if legal protections are inadequate (Anderson 1999; Stewart and Simons
2006). The cultural frame of legal cynicism thus may encourage perceptions that
legal dispute-resolution and victim-avoidance strategies are limited, thereby mak-
ing violence more probable. Indeed, Kirk and Papachristos (2011) found that vio-
lence is pervasive in legally cynical neighbourhoods. Thus, distinct from the typical
criminological view that violence inherently is delinquent or antisocial (Shaw and
McKay 1942; Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990; Moffitt 1993), a cultural frame perspec-
tive allows for the possibility that adolescents within legally cynical neighbourhoods
act violently even if they do not `value' violence or adhere to norms that legitimize
violence. Violence in legally cynical neighbourhoods may be interpreted instead as
practical, situated behavioural responses within contexts (perceived to be) bereft of
legal recourse.
Building upon Kirk and Papachristos' (2011) study, we propose that as a cultural
frame, legal cynicism not only influences adolescents' decisions to use violence but also
shapes parents' views regarding the strategies of action that are reasonably available
to neighbourhood youth engaged in conflict or threatening situations. This is because
cultural frames not only `inform how people cognitively perceive themselves and the
world in which they live' (Kirk and Papachristos 2011: 1196) but they also alter how peo-
ple appraise others' behaviour through the `role-taking' process (Mead 1934; Matsueda
1992). In the following section, we explain how--through the role-taking process--the
cultural frame of legal cynicism alters parents' interpretations of their children's vio-
lent behaviour as symptomatic of individual psychological or trait-based predisposi-
tions to aggression and impulsivity.
SOLLER ET AL.

Legal Cynicism and Role-Taking
Adolescent violence likely is positively associated with parental assessments of their
aggression and impulsivity. But we argue the association between observed behaviour
and appraisals of that behaviour is contingent upon cultural frames--in this case,
legal cynicism--through which parents interpret the situations that adolescents face
throughout their daily lives. These interpretations in turn are realized through the
role-taking process in which parents, who experience different external behavioural
expectations than do their children, nonetheless may identify the constraints associ-
ated with their children's roles.
According to symbolic interaction theory, role-taking is the process of `projecting
oneself into the role of other persons and appraising, from their standpoint, the situa-
tion, oneself in the situation, and possible lines of action' (Matsueda 1992: 1580). For
adolescents and adults, this process involves taking the role of the `generalized other'
(Mead 1934), which encompasses `the norms, rules, and expectations of a group, com-
munity or society' (Matsueda 1992: 1581). Because cultural frames help individuals
interpret these aspects of the social world, frames help individuals make sense of the
generalized other, thereby influencing behaviour appraisals. Taking the role of the
generalized other allows one to understand and identify potential strategies of action
that are associated with the roles others occupy, which may be quite different from one's
own role(s). In this way, cultural frames influence how, e.g., a parent interprets and
identifies, from his or her child's standpoint, appropriate courses of action given situ-
ational constraints.
Upon projecting themselves into the role of their children, parents perceiving ado-
lescents' behaviour through a legal cynicism frame may interpret violence as an appro-
priate strategy of action to resolve grievances or to secure personal safety because legal
recourse is unavailable, illegitimate or ineffective. Accordingly, parents residing in
neighbourhoods with pervasive legal cynicism may be less likely to interpret violence
as symptomatic of individual psychological or trait-based predispositions and instead
understand violence as a situated behavioural response. In contrast, parents in neigh-
bourhoods with low levels of legal cynicism may interpret violence as an unnecessary
and undesirable strategy of action symptomatic of a trait-based predisposition, such as
an aggressive or impulsive temperament.
In summary, we propose legal cynicism encourages residents to interpret violence as
a rational reaction within contexts void of formal social control rather than as indic-
ative of a trait-based predisposition. Accordingly, we hypothesize that legal cynicism will
attenuate the positive association between adolescents' violence and parental assessments of the
extent to which adolescents are aggressive or impulsive. That is, results support the situated
behavioural response hypothesis if, compared to those residing in less cynical neigh-
bourhoods, parents in highly cynical neighbourhoods appraise their children's violent
behaviour as less indicative of an aggressive or impulsive temperament.
Data and Methods
We used data from the first wave (1994­97) of the PHDCN Longitudinal Cohort Study
(LCS) to construct our dependent and individual-level independent variables. Data
for variables measured at the neighbourhood cluster (NC) level--that is, aggregations
LEGAL CYNICISM AND PARENTAL APPRAISALS
571
of one to three census tracts--were drawn from the 1995 PHDCN Community Survey
(CS), the Homicides in Chicago 1965­95 data set (Block et al. 2005) and the 1990
Decennial Census.
Longitudinal Cohort Study
The PHDCN-LCS is a longitudinal study that examines human development through-
out early childhood and emerging adulthood among young people in Chicago. For the
LCS, Chicago's 865 census tracts were combined into 343 NCs that maintained relative
population homogeneity regarding racial and ethnic composition, and housing and
family structural characteristics. PHDCN investigators also defined NCs on the basis
of ecological boundaries, such as parks, railways and freeways. Each NC consisted of
roughly 8,000 people. From there, a two-stage sampling procedure was used to con-
struct a probability sample consisting of 80 of the 343 NCs stratified by socio-economic
status (high, medium and low), and racial and ethnic make-up (seven categories).
The primary objective of sample stratification was to obtain equal representation of
NCs across the 21 strata. Census blocks were randomly selected from each of the 80
representative NCs. Within each block, children and emerging adults from seven age
cohorts (infants, and ages 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18) were sampled from randomly selected
households. In-home interviews were conducted with youth respondents and their pri-
mary caregivers. We focused on respondents from cohorts 9 through 15 because both
parental assessments of trait-based predispositions and respondent reports of violence
were collected from only these cohorts during the first wave of the PHDCN. Our final
sample consisted of 2,293 adolescent respondents with their primary caregivers nested
in 80 NCs.
Community Survey
The PHDCN-CS consists of a probability sample of more than 8,700 adult residents
of Chicago focusing on their assessments of neighbourhood environments. The sur-
vey used a three-stage sampling procedure in which city blocks within Chicago's 343
NCs were randomly selected. Dwelling units within these blocks were then randomly
selected. Finally, one adult aged 18 years or older per household was randomly selected
to complete the survey questionnaire. Although 343 NCs were identified, CS respond-
ents resided in only 342 of them. Approximately 25 respondents were selected from
each of the NCs to allow reliable estimation of neighbourhood-level characteristics
from individual survey responses. PHDCN researchers collected oversamples among
the 80 NCs that included PHDCN-LCS respondents, resulting in an average of roughly
50 CS respondents in each of those NCs.
Dependent Variables
We modelled the interactive effects of legal cynicism and adolescent violence on two
dependent variables that came from validated and widely used behavioural scales, namely
the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 (CBCL) (Achenbach 1991), and the Emotionality,
Activity, Sociability, and Impulsivity Temperament Survey (EASI) (Buss and Plomin 1984).
SOLLER ET AL.
572
The first dependent variable, parental assessments of aggression, was measured with a CBCL
subscale that was designed to identify syndromes of co-occurring behavioural problems
related to violence and aggression (Achenbach 1991). During the Wave 1 interview, car-
egivers were asked to indicate whether a set 20 of problem behaviours `describes [CHILD]
now or within the past 6 months'. Initial responses were scored on a three-point scale ranging
from 0 (`not true') to 2 (`often true'). The aggressive behaviour scale included behaviours
such as getting in many fights, physically attacking people, being cruel, being mean or
bullying others and threatening people.1 As suggested by Achenbach (1991), we measured
parental assessments of aggression by first summing responses to the 20 items ( = 0.880).
Because this variable's distribution was highly skewed, we then added 1 to each individu-
al's externalizing score and log-transformed the resulting measure. Higher values on this
scale suggested parents assess their children as more temperamentally aggressive.
The second dependent variable, parental assessments of impulsivity, was measured using
20 items from the EASI (Buss and Plomin 1984). For this portion of the interview, par-
ents were asked whether a number of statements were characteristic of the focal child.
Similar to Gibson et al. (2010), our measure of parental assessments of impulsivity com-
bined four subscales from the EASI. The first subscale, inhibitory control, included five
items capturing the perceived inability of the child to delay gratification and control his
or her frustrations (e.g. `[CHILD] has trouble controlling his/her impulses'). Decision
time, the second subscale, included five items gauging the parent's perception of child's
inability to delay decision making before considering alternatives (e.g. `[CHILD] often
acts at the spur of the moment'). The third subscale, sensation seeking, comprised five
items tapping preference for new stimuli and acting in the spur of the moment (e.g.
`[CHILD] sometimes does "crazy" things just to be different'). The final subscale, per-
sistence, included five items in which parents assessed their child's diligence and ability
to complete a task (e.g. `[CHILD] generally likes to see things through to the end').
Responses to all scale items ranged from 1 (`uncharacteristic or not at all like [CHILD]')
to 5 (`characteristic or very much like [CHILD]'). To measure parental assessments
of impulsivity, we first reverse-coded scale items that measured low impulsivity (e.g.
`[CHILD] generally likes seeing things through the end'). We then calculated the mean
of the items ( = 0.768). Higher values on the resulting scale indicated higher levels of
perceived impulsivity. Descriptive statistics for both dependent variables and for the
individual- and neighbourhood-level variables are listed in Table 1.
Individual-level independent variables
Adolescent violence
Adolescent respondents indicated whether they engaged in various violent acts within
the 12 months prior to the first-wave interview. We used responses from these items to
construct our key individual-level independent variable--adolescent violence. Adolescent
respondents were asked whether they engaged in the following violent behaviours: (1)
`Hit someone with whom you did not live with the intention of hurting them' (22.3
per cent); (2) `Carried a hidden weapon' (7.2 per cent); (3) `Attacked someone with a
1 As an empirical check, we reran analyses using the full externalizing behaviour scale, which also included parental assess-
ments of their children's non-violent delinquent behaviour (e.g. swears, vandalism, lies, and cheats). Results from those models
were nearly identical to those obtained from the aggressive behaviour subscale presented in this study.

weapon' (2.8 per cent); (4) `Purposely set fire to a house, building, car or vacant lot' (0.9
per cent); (5) `Snatched someone's purse or wallet or picked someone's pocket' (0.6 per
cent); (6) `Thrown objects, such as rocks or bottles, at people' (12.2 per cent); (7) `Used
a weapon or force to get money or things from people' (0.2 per cent) and (8) `Been
involved in a gang fight in which someone was hurt or threatened with harm' (4.8 per
cent). Our measure of adolescent violence represents the number of these violent acts
that the respondent engaged in during the past 12 months.2
Parent­child relationship and family environment
We included measures of the parent­child relationship that likely impact parents' aware-
ness of their children's behaviour. Parental warmth captured affective parenting styles
as measured by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME)
Inventory (Caldwell and Bradley 1984). The scale included nine interviewer-assessed

items indicating whether the primary caregiver performed acts such as mentioning
a particular skill of the focal respondent or praised the adolescent during the Wave 1
interview. Past research using PHDCN data found high reliability and validity for the
parental warmth scale (Leventhal et al. 2004). Our measure of parental warmth repre-
sented the mean of the items ( = 0.759).
We also included two measures capturing parental monitoring of children's activities
and peer groups. Place monitoring was a binary variable indicating whether the adoles-
cent is allowed to wander unsupervised for more than two hours (Browning et al. 2005).
Peer monitoring indicated whether the primary caregiver had contact with at least two
of the adolescent's friends in the past two weeks (Coleman 1990; Browning et al. 2005).
Because parental social capital likely increases parents' access to information about
their children's delinquency, we included two measures from the Provision of Social
Relations module (Turner et al. 1983) that capture dimensions of parents' social rela-
tionships. Support from friends represented a six-item scale that included responses to
questions such as `I share the same approach to life as my friends do' and `My friends
would take the time to talk about my problems, should I ever want to' ( = 0.751). Support
from family represented a six-item scale that included responses to questions such as `I
know my family will always stand by me' and `People in my family help me find solu-
tions to my problems' ( = 0.762). Responses to scale items for both support measures
ranged from 1 (`very true') to 3 (`not true'). To construct each scale, we recoded initial
responses so that higher values indicated higher levels of support and then took the
mean of the items. We also included a measure of residential tenure because it is posi-
tively associated with individuals' neighbourhood-based social capital (Swaroop and
Morenoff 2006). This measure was the number of years that the primary caregiver has
lived at the current address.
Adolescent experiences with violence
We controlled for parents' assessments of their children's exposure to violence with a
dummy variable indicating whether the primary caregiver thought the adolescent was
exposed to at least one of four violent events, such as witnessing a shooting or a physi-
cal assault, in the year leading up to the interview. We included a measure of peer vio-
lence, which was based on four items that indicated the proportion of the adolescent's
friends who have engaged in violent acts, such as attacking someone with a weapon (as
reported by the adolescent respondent). Responses ranged from 1 (`none of them') to 3
(`all of them') (Zimmerman and Messner 2010). Our measure of peer delinquency con-
sisted of the mean of the items ( = 0.675). We also included a dummy variable indicat-
ing whether anyone in the adolescents' family has a criminal record or has been arrested.
Demographic characteristics
We also included a measure of age (in years) and a dummy indicating male sex. Race
and ethnicity were captured with a series of indicators for black, Latino and other (white
was the omitted reference category). Family structure was assessed with an indicator of
whether both biological parents were present. Socio-economic status was captured by
the first component from a principal component analysis of the maximum value for
occupational status, education and income among the parents in each adolescent's
household.
LEGAL CYNICISM AND PARENTAL APPRAISALS
575
Neighbourhood-level independent variables
Legal cynicism
Our key neighbourhood-level independent variable, legal cynicism, was assessed using
responses from all adult participants in the PHDCN-CS. This measure captures the
extent to which residents lack confidence in the law and law enforcement. Following
Kirk and Papachristos (2011), our measure of legal cynicism included responses to the
following three items: (1) `Laws were made to be broken', (2) `The police are not doing
a good job in preventing crime in this neighbourhood' and (3) `The police are not able
to maintain order on the streets and sidewalks in the neighbourhood'. Initial responses
ranged from 1 (`strongly agree') to 5 (`strongly disagree'). To measure legal cynicism,
we first estimated a three-level, linear item response theory (IRT) model with reverse-
coded items nested within respondents nested within each of the 342 NCs. The IRT
model considered legal cynicism as an underlying construct whose neighbourhood-
level latent value is based on scale items as well as individual and neighbourhood pre-
dispositions.3 From the IRT model, we derived the neighbourhood-level empirical Bayes
(EB)-adjusted intercepts (multilevel reliability = 0.785). These EB-adjusted intercepts
comprised our final measure--the mean value of legal cynicism within each neigh-
bourhood adjusted for scale item severity as well as individual- and neighbourhood-
level random variation (Sampson et al. 1997; Raudenbush and Bryk 2002).
Collective efficacy
We also controlled for collective efficacy in our models because neighbourhood cohe-
sion and intergenerational closure may influence parents' knowledge of their chil-
dren's delinquency. We measured collective efficacy by combining information from
two subscales--social cohesion/trust and intergenerational closure--that were admin-
istered as part of the PHDCN-CS. This collective efficacy scale was intended to capture
adult­child social ties and expectations for support and informal social control of local
youth by neighbourhood adults (Browning et al. 2005). Following Sampson et al. (1999),
we combined the 10 items comprising these subscales into a single measure of collec-
tive efficacy using the same IRT modelling strategy previously described (multilevel
reliability = 0.780).4
Neighbourhood violent crime
To reduce the possibility that the effect of legal cynicism on the slope of violence is
attributable to high levels of neighbourhood violence, we controlled for the NC-level
homicide rate.5 We obtained incident-level homicide data from the victim-level file of
3 We employed this IRT approach to measure key neighbourhood-level variables because the random effects in the IRT model
adjust for unique individual- and neighbourhood-level propensities for legal cynicism. The IRT model also adjusts legal cyni-
cism values according to the inverse of their reliability, i.e. less reliable neighbourhood values are pulled towards the grand
mean. Neighbourhood values of legal cynicism are less reliable if they are based on either fewer valid responses to scale items
within the individual or on fewer individuals within the neighbourhood (Sampson et al. 1997; Raudenbush and Bryk 2002).
4 Our measure of collective efficacy is more theoretically relevant to our analysis--e.g. it captures parents' potential to become
aware of their children's delinquency--than is the more common collective efficacy measure, which combines the cohesion/
trust and informal social control subscales (Sampson et al. 1997). Nonetheless, results from analyses using the more common
measure are nearly identical to those presented in this article.
5 We use the homicide rate because this crime is measured with greater reliability than other violent crimes (e.g. robbery and
assault).

the Homicides in Chicago, 1965­95 data set (Block et al. 2005). We aggregated counts
of homicides occurring between 1992 and 1994 to the NC level. Because a neighbour-
hood's population size likely impacts its homicide rate, we estimated an unconditional
two-level Poisson model with variable exposure based on the 1990 census-based popu-
lation of the NC. From this model, we obtained the EB-adjusted homicide rate for
each NC. The EB-adjusted homicide rate is the adjusted log of the event rate ratio
per 1,000 population for each NC's three-year homicide count (Kirk and Papachristos
2011). The major benefit of this approach is that the procedure reduces the skew of the
homicide count distribution while taking into account variation in population expo-
sure (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002).
Because neighbours' direct experiences with violence also may alter parental
appraisals of violence, we included two measures that capture neighbourhood resi-
dents' experience with neighbourhood violence. Neighbourhood victimization was cap-
tured by the following question asked of PHDCN-CS respondents: `While you have
lived in this neighbourhood, has anyone ever used violence, such as in a mugging,
fight, or sexual assault, against you or any member of your household anywhere in
your neighbourhood?' Our neighbourhood victimization measure represented the pro-
portion of NC residents who answered affirmatively to the question. A second meas-
ure captured neighbourhood residents' perceived frequency of violence. This measure was
based on four indicators of whether the following events occurred `often' in the past
six months (0 = no, 1 = yes): (1) `a fight in this neighbourhood in which a weapon was
used', (2) `a violent argument between neighbours', (3) `gang fights' and (4) `a robbery
or mugging'. We combined the four items into a single measure, which equalled the
neighbourhood-level EB-adjusted intercepts from a three-level Rasch model (multilevel
reliability = 0.698)--that is, an extension of the IRT model that is suitable for analysing
dichotomous outcomes (Raudenbush et al. 2003).
Subcultural norms or attitudes condoning violence among neighbourhood residents
also may attenuate the positive association between violence and parental assessments
of aggression and impulsivity. Tolerance of fighting was captured by the following ques-
tion asked of PHDCN-CS respondents: `How wrong is it for teenagers around thirteen
years of age to get into fist fights?' Initial responses ranged from 1 (`extremely wrong')
to 5 (`not at all wrong'). Our measure of tolerance of fighting represented the mean
response within each neighbourhood.
Finally, legal cynicism may be confounded with residents' perceptions of police
responsiveness. We, therefore, included a neighbourhood-level measure of percep-
tions of police responsiveness, which was captured by the following question asked of
PHDCN-CS respondents: `How much of a problem is police not patrolling the area or
responding to calls from the area?' Our police responsiveness measure was the propor-
tion of respondents within each neighbourhood who answered `Somewhat of a prob-
lem' or `A big problem' (versus `Not a problem').
Neighbourhood structural characteristics
We constructed measures of neighbourhood structural characteristics using data from
the 1990 Census. Following past research and theory on the determinants of neigh-
bourhood crime (Land et al. 1990), we constructed our measures using principle com-
ponents analysis with oblique rotated factor patterns of nine measures at the NC level.

The first principle component from the analysis, concentrated disadvantage, was domi-
nated by the percentage of residents on public assistance, percentage of residents with
incomes below the poverty line, percentage female-headed households, percentage
unemployed and percentage of residents who are younger than 18. The second compo-
nent, immigrant concentration, was defined by the percentage of foreign-born residents
and percentage of residents who are Latino. Finally, residential stability consisted primar-
ily of the percentage of owner-occupied homes and the percentage of persons living in
the same house for five or more years.
Analytic strategy
Missing values on individual-level independent variables were multiply imputed using
Stata's Imputation through Chained Equations (ICE) command. We use this imputa-
tion procedure because unlike traditional methods that substitute missing values with
central tendency measures (e.g. mean and mode), ICE accounts for random variation in
responses (Royston 2004). Following von Hippel (2007), we created ten imputed data sets
from a data set that included respondents with missing data on the dependent variable.
These data sets comprised the aforementioned independent and dependent variables so
that the imputations take into account the multivariate structure of analysis models as
well as the associations between predictors and outcomes. In other words, this approach
ensures that the imputation and analysis models are `compatible'. We then dropped
respondents with missing data on the dependent variable in our final analysis models.
All analysis models are two-level, hierarchical linear models (HLM) estimated with
the imputed data sets using HLM7's multiple imputation estimation procedure. We use
HLM because the PHDCN data are hierarchically structured. Because respondents are
nested within neighbourhoods, they are likely to be correlated on the dependent vari-
able; in the absence of adjustment for residual correlation among observations within
neighbourhoods, standard errors may be biased downward. We account for clustering
of individuals within neighbourhoods using a random effects approach (Raudenbush
and Bryk 2002).
Table 2 displays results from multilevel regressions of parental assessments of aggres-
sion on adolescent violence, and Table 3 displays results from comparable regressions
of parental appraisals of impulsivity. For each outcome, Model 1 included adolescent
violence and the following individual-level control variables: age, sex, race, family struc-
ture, socio-economic status, residential tenure, parental warmth, place monitoring,
peer monitoring, family history of arrest, support from friends, support from family,
exposure to violence and peer violence. At the neighbourhood level, we also controlled
for collective efficacy, the homicide rate, concentrated disadvantage, immigrant con-
centration and residential stability. In Model 2, we allowed the slope of adolescent vio-
lence to randomly vary to measure the extent of variation in the effect of this variable
across neighbourhoods. In Model 3, we introduced legal cynicism at the neighbour-
hood level. Finally, in Model 4, we tested our primary hypothesis--that legal cynicism
attenuates the positive association between adolescent violence and parental assess-
ments of related trait-based predispositions--by introducing a cross-level interaction
between legal cynicism and adolescent violence. In all analyses, statistical significance
was assessed with two-tailed tests and robust standard errors.

In analyses, all individual- and neighbourhood-level covariates were grand-mean
centred save for adolescent violence, which was group-mean centred. We group-mean
centred adolescent violence to isolate within- from between-neighbourhood variation
(Raudenbush and Bryk 2002). This allowed us to control for the possibility that the
differential effect of adolescent violence across neighbourhoods is attributable neigh-
bourhood compositional differences--e.g. little within-neighbourhood variation in
adolescent violence but higher average levels of violence among adolescents residing in
legally cynical neighbourhoods--rather than contextual differences in legal cynicism.
In Models 1­3, the coefficient on adolescent violence, therefore, refers to the expected
difference in parental assessments of aggression or impulsivity for adolescents residing
in the same neighbourhood who differ by one unit on self-reported violence. The Level
2 intercept refers to the neighbourhood mean parental assessment value unadjusted
for adolescent violence but adjusted for other individual-level variables included in the
model. In Model 4, the coefficient on the adolescent violence × legal cynicism interaction
term refers to the effect of legal cynicism on the slope of adolescent violence within a
given neighbourhood.
Results
Parental assessments of aggression
Results from Model 1 in Table 2 indicate that, as expected, adolescents' self-reported
violence is positively associated with parental assessments of aggression. We also find
that the age of the adolescent, family structure, parental warmth, place monitoring,
peer monitoring and parents' support from family each is negatively associated with
parents' assessments of their children's aggression. In contrast, exposure to violence,
peer violence and family history of arrest each is positively associated with parental
assessments of aggression. Coefficients on other variables in this model fail to reach
statistical significance at the p < 0.05 level.
In a model otherwise identical to Model 1, Model 2 includes a random effect on the
slope of adolescent violence. The random effect is significant suggesting that there is
unexplained variation in the effect of adolescent violence on parental assessments of
aggression across neighbourhood contexts (
01
= 0.013, p < 0.05). With the inclusion of
this random effect, the coefficient on peer monitoring reaches only marginal statistical
significance, but all the other findings from Model 1 persist.
Building on Model 2, in Model 3, we added the neighbourhood legal cynicism meas-
ure at level two. Although this measure is not statistically associated with parental
assessments of aggression, the other findings from Model 2 persist. Finally, in Model
4, we tested the cross-level interaction between adolescent violence and legal cynicism.
We find that the coefficient on this interaction term is negative and significant, sug-
gesting that neighbourhood legal cynicism attenuates the positive association between
adolescent violence and parental assessments of aggression. Additionally, we find that
the random effect on the slope of adolescent violence no longer reaches statistical sig-
nificance--that is, with the inclusion of the adolescent violence × legal cynicism interaction
term, we no longer find unexplained variation in the effect of adolescent violence on
parental assessments of aggression across neighbourhoods. This suggests that legal cyn-
icism accounts for the random variation in the association between adolescent violence
LEGAL CYNICISM AND PARENTAL APPRAISALS
581
and the outcome across neighbourhoods. In this more inclusive model, the coefficient
on peer monitoring again reaches statistical significance at the p < 0.05 level, and the
other findings from Model 3 persist.
Figure 1 illustrates the interactive effect of legal cynicism and adolescent violence
on parental assessments of aggression. Predicted values along the y-axis are based on
results from Model 4 of Table 2 when all other variables are held at their grand means.
Values along the x-axis refer to an adolescent's relative distance from the within-neigh-
bourhood mean of self-reported violence. The black, grey and dashed lines represent
the association between adolescent violence and assessments of aggression in neigh-
bourhoods with low (1.5 standard deviations below the mean), medium (the mean)
and high (1.5 standard deviations above the mean) levels of legal cynicism, respec-
tively. The black line suggests that when neighbourhood legal cynicism is low, adoles-
cents are assessed by their parents as more aggressive if they are more violent relative
to other neighbourhood youth. In contrast, the dashed line suggests that in neigh-
bourhoods characterized by high levels of legal cynicism, there is little difference in
parental assessments of aggression across levels of adolescent violence. For example,
when legal cynicism is low, the predicted parental assessment of aggression score for
an adolescent who engages in one fewer act of violence relative to the neighbourhood
mean (3.56) is approximately 11 per cent lower than that of an adolescent who engages

in one additional act of violence relative to the neighbourhood mean (4.01). But when
neighbourhood legal cynicism is high, the predicted aggression score of the less violent
adolescent (3.72) is less than 1 per cent lower than that of the more violent adolescent
(3.75). Thus, in highly legally cynical neighbourhoods, there is a negligible influence of
adolescents' violent behaviour on parental assessments of their aggression. This finding
supports our assertion that legal cynicism encourages parents to conceptualize violence
as situated behavioural responses to threatening contexts, rather than as indicative of
an aggressive temperament.
Parental assessments of impulsivity
To further investigate whether parents' interpretations of children's behaviour are
influenced by neighbourhood legal cynicism, we now turn to models of parental assess-
ments of impulsivity. In Model 1 of Table 3, we find that adolescents' self-reported
violence is positively associated with assessments of impulsivity, but this measure
only reaches marginal statistical significance in this model (p < 0.10). We also find
that younger adolescents are assessed by their parents as less impulsive, and boys are
assessed as more impulsive than girls. Our results also show that compared to adoles-
cents who are white, adolescents who are black or Latino are assessed by their parents
as less impulsive. Family structure, parental warmth, place monitoring and parents'
social support from family each is negatively associated with parental assessments of
impulsivity. In contrast, socio-economic status, exposure to violence, peer violence
and family history of arrest each is positively associated with assessments of impulsiv-
ity. None of the coefficients on the other variables reaches statistical significance at
the p < 0.05 level.
We added a random effect on the slope of adolescent violence in Model 2. Consistent
with the results on assessments of aggression, the random effect is significant, suggest-
ing that there is unexplained variation in the effect of adolescent violence on parental
assessments of impulsivity across neighbourhoods (
01
= 0.005, p < 0.01). With the inclu-
sion of this random effect, the positive coefficient on adolescent violence now reaches
statistical significance (p < 0.05) and the other findings from Model 1 persist.
We introduced legal cynicism to the neighbourhood-level equation in Model 3. The
coefficient on legal cynicism fails to reach statistical significance, but the other findings
from Model 2 persist. Finally, in Model 4, we added the cross-level interaction between
adolescent violence and neighbourhood legal cynicism. We find that the coefficient
on the interaction term is negative and significant. Thus, consistent with our hypoth-
esis, legal cynicism attenuates the positive association between adolescent violence and
parental assessments of impulsivity.
With the inclusion of this interaction term, we also no longer find unexplained vari-
ation in the slope of adolescent violence across neighbourhoods. Consistent with the
results for assessments of aggression, this finding suggests that legal cynicism accounts
for the random variation in the association between adolescent violence and parental
assessments of impulsivity across neighbourhoods.
Analogous to Figure 1, Figure 2 illustrates the interactive effect of adolescent vio-
lence and legal cynicism on parental assessments of impulsivity (predictions based
on results from Model 4 of Table 3 when all other variables are held at their grand
LEGAL CYNICISM AND PARENTAL APPRAISALS
583
means). The black line in Figure 2 suggests that where neighbourhood legal cynicism
is low, adolescents are assessed as more impulsive if they exhibit higher levels of vio-
lence compared to other neighbourhood youth. In contrast, the dashed line suggests
that where neighbourhood legal cynicism is high, there is little difference in parental
assessments of impulsivity for relatively non-violent and violent youth. For example,
when legal cynicism is low, the predicted parental assessment of impulsivity score for
an adolescent who engages in one fewer act of violence relative to the neighbourhood
mean (2.33) is approximately 9 per cent lower than that of an adolescent who engages
in one additional act of violence relative to the neighbourhood mean (2.56). But when
neighbourhood legal cynicism is high, the predicted aggression score of the less violent
adolescent (2.45) is only 2 per cent lower than that of the more violent adolescent (2.5).
In summary, we hypothesized that where legal recourse is believed to be an ineffective
or an otherwise unreasonable strategy of action, parents appraise violent behaviour as rea-
sonable responses to conflict or threatening situations in contexts bereft of formal social
control rather than as indicative of trait-based predispositions. Consistent with this situated
behavioural response hypothesis, we find that the positive association between adolescent
violence and parental assessments of aggression and of impulsivity observed at low levels of
neighbourhood legal cynicism becomes negligible at higher levels of legal cynicism.

Sensitivity analyses
We hypothesized that neighbourhood legal cynicism modifies how parents appraise
their children's violent behaviour. We found strong support for this hypothesis across
two outcomes--assessments of aggression and of impulsivity. Nonetheless, we explored
whether other processes account for our results. Models 4 of Tables 2 and 3 are the
bases for the following sensitivity analyses of aggression and impulsivity, respectively.
Berg et al. (2012) and Harding (2007) suggested that disadvantaged neighbourhoods
were characterized by heterogeneity in cultural frames. Cultural heterogeneity in turn
was thought to shape violence in part because it provided a wider variety of strategies
of action (including violence) for residents to draw upon. Following the approach of
Berg et al. (2012) to measuring neighbourhood cultural heterogeneity with multi-item
scales, we constructed a measure of neighbourhood heterogeneity in legal cynicism and
tested whether it modified the association between adolescent violence and appraisals
of aggression and impulsivity (results not shown). We fail to find that cultural heteroge-
neity influences the slope of adolescent violence for either outcome.
We also performed a sensitivity analysis on each outcome to test whether the effects of
legal cynicism on the adolescent violence slopes are attributable to other mechanisms.
For each model, we introduced all remaining neighbourhood covariates--neighbour-
hood victimization, frequency of violence, tolerance of fighting and police responsive-
ness to the neighbourhood-level intercept and adolescent violence slope equations (i.e.
we added cross-level interactions between each neighbourhood variable and adolescent
violence). We also interacted adolescent violence with the following individual-level var-
iables: residential tenure, parental warmth, place monitoring, peer monitoring, family
history of arrest, support from friends and family, exposure to violence and peer vio-
lence. Table 4 displays the results from the sensitivity analysis of parental assessments
of aggression (Model 1) and of impulsivity (Model 2).
The results from Model 1 indicate that the interactive effect of legal cynicism and
adolescent violence on parental assessments of aggression remains significant and
increases in magnitude after including the aforementioned individual- and cross-level
interactions with adolescent violence. Similarly, the results from Model 2 show that
interactive effect of legal cynicism and adolescent violence on parental assessments of
impulsivity remains significant and also increases in magnitude. Together, these results
attest to the robustness of the interactive effects of adolescent violence and legal cyni-
cism on parental assessments of aggressive and impulsive temperaments.
Discussion
Recently, research has focused on the criminological consequences of legal cynicism--
the belief that legal recourse is illegitimate, unavailable or otherwise ineffective. Our
study contributes to this emerging endeavour by examining the influence of neighbour-
hood legal cynicism on parental appraisals of adolescent violent behaviour. We integrated
insights from symbolic interaction theory and a cultural frames approach to investigate
the microprocesses through which cultural frames shape interpretations of violent behav-
iour. We argued that frames not only inform strategies for resolving disputes but also
influence interpretations of behaviour through the role-taking process. Specifically,
we proposed that legal cynicism influences behaviour appraisals by leading individuals
LEGAL CYNICISM AND PARENTAL APPRAISALS
585
to interpret violence as a central component of adolescent roles caused by contextual
constraints (i.e. a lack of legal recourse) rather than by individual temperaments. We,
therefore, predicted that when the surrounding context is characterized by higher lev-
els of legal cynicism, parents--upon taking the roles of their children--increasingly
would rationalize their children's violence as situated behavioural responses to legitimate
threats rather than as indicative of temperamental predispositions to violence alone.

Using data from the PHDCN and administrative sources, we tested our hypothe-
sis with multilevel regressions of parental assessments of two trait-based predisposi-
tions related to violence--aggression and impulsivity--on adolescent's self-reported
violence, neighbourhood legal cynicism and a cross-level interaction between the two
measures. We find that legal cynicism attenuates the positive associations between ado-
lescents' reported violence and each parental assessment outcome. Consistent with our
hypothesis, our results, therefore, suggest that parents are less likely to appraise ado-
lescents' violent behaviour as indicative of aggressive or impulsive temperaments when
the neighbourhood is characterized by higher levels of legal cynicism.
Our findings suggest that although parental assessments of trait-based predisposi-
tions may be influenced by children's actual behaviour, they also may be biased by
contextual factors. This finding is relevant to a number of prominent criminological
theories that focus on individual traits and temperaments to explain criminal offend-
ing. For instance, Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) argue that low self-control is sta-
ble throughout adolescence and adulthood and is the underlying cause of antisocial
behaviour across the life course. Empirical assessments of Gottfredson and Hirschi's
theory depend upon valid measures of key constructs like impulsivity. Moffitt (1993)
suggests that adolescent limited offenders' delinquency is assessed differently by par-
ents and teachers because of the instability of their antisocial behaviour across time
and social contexts. But it may be that such differential assessments in part are a func-
tion of the frame (e.g. legal cynicism) through which appraisers view and interpret
their behaviour. Given the common reliance on parental or other external assessments
(e.g. teacher assessments) in studies of adolescent crime and delinquency (Wareham
and Boots 2011), it is crucial to identify and control for the influence of contextual fac-
tors on appraisals of adolescent behaviour. Identifying and controlling for such contex-
tual biases--namely, legal cynicism--may help explain why the associations between
trait-based predispositions, such as impulsivity and externalizing behaviour problems,
and adolescent crime and delinquency are inconsistent across neighbourhoods (Lynam
et al. 2000; Zimmerman 2010).
Our findings also have implications for understanding processes related to adolescent
delinquency. Parents who rationalize violence as necessary to deter victimization may
be less likely to emphasize non-violent victimization-avoidance strategies and instead
encourage aggressive posturing in order maintain street status and the respect of one's
peers (Anderson 1999). While aggressive posturing may entail advantages within legally
cynical residential neighbourhoods, it likely is detrimental within mainstream contexts,
such as schools or workplaces, and consequently may lead to further marginalization and
social isolation. Subsequent research may provide more insight into whether changes in
parenting behaviour mediate the association between legal cynicism and delinquency
among adolescents and their subsequent well-being throughout the life course.
Despite our robust findings on the moderating influence of legal cynicism on the
effect of adolescent behaviour on two parental assessment outcomes, our study is not
without limitations. The data collection of the PHDCN took place in 1994 and 1995.
Unfortunately, no subsequent neighbourhood-based study has included both the
sophisticated sampling design and extensive neighbourhood and individual measures
characteristic of the PHDCN. Although our theoretical approach is not period specific,
future research using more recently collected data could assess whether the influence
of legal cynicism on parental appraisals remains the same.
LEGAL CYNICISM AND PARENTAL APPRAISALS

Another limitation of the PHDCN is that the data come from a single city. It is possible
that the cultural processes we examine in this study were shaped by unique attributes
of Chicago, including its situation in the historical context of US crime patterns and
administration of criminal justice. The legacy of slavery, immigration policy, residen-
tial segregation and extreme racial and ethnic disparities in criminal justice outcomes
may shape the importance and character of legal cynicism in US cities, especially as
they pertain to African Americans and Latinos. For instance, Kirk and Matsuda (2011)
found that in Chicago, African American-concentrated neighbourhoods had higher
levels of legal cynicism, which were associated with a lower likelihood of arrest follow-
ing the commission of a crime. In their study of New York City, Kirk et al. (2012) found
that communities with high immigrant concentration exhibited lower levels of legal
cynicism, which were associated with increased cooperation with the police. Kirk and
colleagues emphasized that the lower levels of legal cynicism in these immigrant com-
munities could be jeopardized by aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. These
two studies not only demonstrate the salience of race and ethnicity in the United States
but they also show that racial and ethnic differences in outcomes related to coopera-
tion with the police are partially explained by a cultural frame--legal cynicism. The
broader implication, which is beyond the scope of this analysis, is that cultural frames
such as legal cynicism may explain differences between the racial and ethnic groups
relevant to a given national or historical context.
Even though our analysis is based on just one city, this study provides a general foun-
dation for investigating how cultural frames shape interpretations of behaviour. So
although legal cynicism may be less applicable or fundamentally different in non-US
or rural contexts, e.g. the role-taking process through which a relevant local cultural
frame influences appraisals of behaviour is a general process (Mead 1934) and, there-
fore, likely has explanatory power, regardless of the larger context. Ultimately, this
is an empirical question. Future research that includes neighbourhoods from several
urban, suburban and rural areas within or outside of the United States can test whether
the results from our analysis stem from general processes or from dynamics that are
unique to the city of Chicago. Furthermore, examining neighbourhoods across multi-
ple macro-level units would help identify how higher order factors shape local cultural
processes.
Despite its temporal and geographic limitations, the PHDCN data include exten-
sive information on adolescents and their caregivers. But we were unable to measure
two important characteristics of parents. First, primary caregivers' legal cynicism--
which could represent an important mediating factor--was not measured. While the
CS component of the PHDCN enabled more reliable measurements of legal cynicism
in neighbourhoods, we were unable to test the influence of legal cynicism of the adoles-
cent respondents' parents. Second, parents' knowledge of their children's delinquency
within legally cynical neighbourhoods may influence their appraisals. As Rios's (2011)
recent ethnographic study suggests, adolescents embedded in neighbourhoods with
high distrust of legal authorities may be less likely to `snitch' on fellow residents to
police. Restrictions against snitching may increase the likelihood that violent offenses
remain unknown by the offenders' parents as well as other authority figures, such as
teachers and school officials. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, we were unable
to assess how anti-snitching norms influence parental appraisals of their children's
violent behaviour. Nonetheless, we tested whether related factors, such as collective

efficacy--which captures intergenerational closure--and indicators of the parent­
child relationship, explained the interactive effect of legal cynicism and adolescent
violence on parental appraisals. We find that including interactions between these vari-
ables and adolescent violence failed to account for our findings. Still, further research
that directly measures parent's awareness of their children's delinquency may advance
our understanding of the impact of legal cynicism on parental appraisals of their chil-
dren's behaviour.
This study highlights the potential role police and other agents of the law have
in changing violent contexts. Our study suggests that as cultural frame, legal cyni-
cism induces individuals to interpret violence as a reasonable strategy to avoid vic-
timization or to settle grievances. But improved police effectiveness and relations
between law enforcement and community residents may decrease the salience of
legal cynicism, thereby attenuating notions that violence is an appropriate or desir-
able reaction to threatening circumstances. In this way, better relations between law
enforcement and community residents could contribute to less violent and healthier
environments.
