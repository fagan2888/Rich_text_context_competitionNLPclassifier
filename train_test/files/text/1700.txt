Hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) that accounts for 37% of deaths in the United
States, and despite availability of proven therapies and multiple
national and international guidelines on treatment, hyperten-
sion control rates continue to be low.1­7
In many clinical trials, lifestyle changes have been demon-
strated to effectively control hypertension including: weight
loss, dietary sodium restriction, alcohol moderation, and
regular exercise.8­13 Furthermore, in contrast to drug therapy,
comprehensive lifestyle changes have been demonstrated to
give additional benefits beyond blood pressure (BP) reduction
such as favorable effects on weight, fitness, and cholesterol lev-
els.12 Thus, the seventh report of the Joint National Committee
on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
High Blood Pressure recommended that all patients with the
diagnosis of hypertension receive lifestyle recommendations
with or without pharmacological treatment.14
Understanding physician advice-giving is essential to
improving hypertension control rates. Characterizing patient
factors associated with adherence is also important given evi-
dence from clinical trials suggesting that as long as adherence
is sustained, BP effects persist.12,13 Previous studies have sug-
gested that both poor physician adherence to treatment guide-
lines and poor patient adherence to recommended therapy are
possible reasons for low rates of BP control.15­21 However, even
if physicians did prescribe lifestyle changes, patients might not
have understood the counseling and in effect, not have received
them. To assess how frequently patients with hypertension
report receiving lifestyle modification counseling, and to
explore which patient characteristics, including BP control, are
associated with the receipt of and adherence to such counseling,
we examined results from a nationally representative survey of
adults who had been previously diagnosed with hypertension.

Lifestyle Modification Counseling for Hypertensive
Patients: Results From the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2004

Background
Lifestyle modification is recommended for all patients with the
diagnosis of hypertension.
Methods
We examined 3,497 adult hypertensive participants (representing
42 million Americans), from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004.We analyzed the rate,
demographic, and clinical factors of participants who reported
receiving lifestyle counseling and their adherence.
Results
Of the 3,497 participants with hypertension, 84% reported receiving
lifestyle modification counseling. After adjustment for demographic
and clinical characteristics, non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to
report receiving counseling (odds ratio (OR), 2.5; P < 0.001) when
compared to whites. Men (OR, 1.5; P = 0.02) reported receiving
counseling more often than women as well as those with Medicare
insurance (OR, 1.5; P = 0.02) compared to the privately insured.
Participants who were hypercholesterolemic (OR, 1.7; P < 0.001),
diabetic (OR, 3.5; P < 0.001), overweight (OR, 1.5; P < 0.001), or obese
(OR 3.0; P < 0.001) reported receiving lifestyle counseling more often
than those without these conditions. Of those receiving counseling,
88% reported adhering to those recommendations. After adjustment
for demographic and clinical characteristics, only non-Hispanic
blacks (OR, 2.8; P < 0.001) and those aged >60 (OR, 1.9; P = 0.04) were
more likely to report adhering when advised.
Conclusions
High cardiovascular risk hypertensive patients had high rates of
lifestyle counseling. However, gaps exist in lifestyle counseling for
young and low cardiovascular risk hypertensive patients. In addition,
differences in rates of adherence exist especially in those with high
cardiovascular risk comorbid conditions. Future work is needed
to increase adherence to lifestyle counseling for all hypertensive
patients.

Methods
Study population. Using data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004, we
examined adult participants aged >20 years who reported
being told by a provider on two or more different visits that
they had hypertension or "high BP." We limited our analysis to
patients who reported at least two observations of elevated BP
because, unlike patients noted to have an isolated elevated BP,
published hypertension guidelines at the time recommended
that these patients should have received hypertension treat-
ment with lifestyle therapy (e.g., lose weight, increase exercise,
cut down on salt intake, quit smoking or decrease alcohol con-
sumption) with or without medication.14,22
Survey data. NHANES is a complex, stratified multistage
probability sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US
population comprised an interview questionnaire, a physical
exam, and a laboratory test section. The current NHANES
is a continuous survey with the data release cycle altered to
every 2 years. We followed current recommendations from the
National Center for Health Statistics and considered the time
period from 1999 to 2004 as one period and used the updated
6-year sample weights for all analyses. A detailed description
of the history, design, data collection, and available data for
NHANES is available at the website of the National Center for
Health Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).23
Main outcomes of interest were the odds of reporting receipt
of and of adhering to lifestyle modification recommendations.
The NHANES interview questions assessing receipt of and
adherence to lifestyle modification recommendations are pro-
vided in Table 1. As NHANES does not provide detailed clini-
cal history to completely determine which lifestyle counseling
each participant should be receiving, we deemed participants
to have received lifestyle counseling if they responded "yes" to
any one of the questions in order to improve their BP listed
in Table 1. Participants were determined to have not received
lifestyle therapy if they received only medication therapy or no
therapy at all. We deemed participants to be adherent if they
responded "yes" to appropriate follow-up questions regard-
ing adherence. In cases where participants received multiple
lifestyle therapies, they are considered adherent if they replied
that they are adherent to any of the lifestyle therapies. We also
included the question of whether the participant reported ever
being told to take antihypertensive medications for secondary
analyses of the association between BP and the choice of phy-
sician therapeutic intervention.
From the survey, we also obtained participants' self-reported
race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was coded in NHANES as non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
other Hispanic, and other/multiracial. We grouped Mexican
American and other Hispanic into one category. Financial
status was categorized using the poverty income ratio, where
family income is divided by the federally defined poverty
threshold for that family (poverty income ratio <1 indicated
impoverished). Low educational level was defined by noncom-
pletion of 12th grade. Insurance status was defined as medi-
cal coverage provided by Medicare, Medicaid, private sources
(including government and single service insurance) or having
no insurance. Diabetes was defined as self-report of physician
diagnosis or as current or past user of insulin or oral hypogly-
cemic agent. We excluded diabetes diagnoses made during
pregnancy. History of CVD included congestive heart failure,
coronary artery disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and
stroke. We also included whether participants reported having
a usual source of health care.
Examination and laboratory data. From the NHANES exami-
nation and laboratory files we obtained participants body mass
index (BMI). Overweight was defined as a BMI of 25­29kg/m2
and obesity was defined as BMI 30kg/m2. BP was measured
three or four times manually by a trained operator using a
mercury sphygmomanometer according to a standard proto-
col and calculated as the average after excluding the first meas-
urement. The BP measurement techniques were identical over
the three periods (1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004).
Statistical analysis. Each survey oversampled non-Hispanic
blacks, Mexican Americans, and individuals aged 60. Special
sampleweightsprovidedbyNationalCenterforHealthStatistics
were included in the analysis to adjust for oversampling as well
as nonresponse bias and post-stratification population totals.
Sampling errors were obtained using a Taylor linear approxi-
mation method with replacement.23 Due to the complex design
of NHANES, SUDAAN statistical software (Research Triangle

Park, NC) was used for all analyses. We used the 2-test to com-
pare the distribution of study variables among patients who
received and adhered to counseling. Factors significantly asso-
ciated with either receiving or adhering to lifestyle recommen-
dations were then included in a multivariable-logistic regres-
sion analysis to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of receiving and adhering
to lifestyle counseling. The following demographic and clinical
variables were included in our models (age, gender, race, US
born, insurance status, income and education level, having a
usual place of care, BMI, diabetes, high cholesterol, and CVD).
All P values reported are for two-tailed tests and a value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant. In secondary analyses,
we performed analysis of variance to compare the association
between receipt of lifestyle modification alone, medication use
alone, or receipt of both therapeutic modalities, with mean
systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) levels at the time of the
survey. Similar analyses of variance were done to examine the
association between participant adherence to the therapeutic
modality recommended and mean SBP and DBP levels.
Results
Participant and clinical characteristics
Among adult participants in NHANES 1999­2004 (n =
29,402), there were 3,497 adult hypertensives with data regard-
ing receipt of lifestyle modification counseling, representing
42 million Americans. Of participants with hypertension, 78%
were non-Hispanic white, 14% were non-Hispanic black, and
8% were Hispanics (Table 2). Those who were >60 years of age
comprised 46% of the adult hypertensive population and 42%
were 41­60 years of age. There were slightly more women than
men and the majority were born in the United States. Overall,
most of the participants were privately insured and had a usual
place of care. A small proportion of the study sample was
poor and had less than a 12th grade education. The majority
of hypertensive participants were overweight or obese and had
high cholesterol. A smaller proportion of the participants had
CVD or diabetes.
Receipt of lifestyle modification counseling
Of the adult hypertensive population, 84.3% reported receiving
lifestyle modification counseling. Of these, 81.7% were advised
to reduce their dietary sodium, 79.3% to exercise more, 65.5%
to lose weight, 31% to reduce alcohol consumption, and 4.4%
to quit smoking.
In unadjusted analyses, participants who were aged >40
years, had a usual place of care, were obese (BMI 30), diabetic
or had high cholesterol reported receiving lifestyle counseling
more often than their counterparts (Table 2). In addition, non-
Hispanic blacks reported more often receiving counseling than
Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.
Demographic differences in receipt of counseling remained
after adjustment for demographic and clinical character-
istics. Men continued to report receiving counseling more
often than women and non-Hispanic blacks more often than
non-
Hispanic whites. Participants with Medicare insurance
reported receiving counseling more often than those with
other insurance groups. Participants with high cholesterol,
diabetes, or who were overweight (BMI 25­29), or obese (BMI
30) reported receiving lifestyle counseling more often than
their counterparts (Table 3).
The type of physician intervention reported by partici-
pants depended on the underlying BP (Figure 1). Those par-
ticipants who reported receiving only medication advice had
the highest mean SBPs (139mmHg), followed by those who
reported getting both lifestyle counseling and medication
advice (136mmHg), followed by those who only got advice
(132mmHg). Those who reported no physician advice inter-
vention had the lowest mean SBP (129mmHg) of the cohort
(P values across all four groups P < 0.001).
There was a small difference between the four groups in
mean DBP (overall P < 0.001). Those who reported receiving
only medication advice had a mean DBP of 72mmHg while
those that reported getting both lifestyle counseling and medi-
cation advice had a mean DBP of 74mmHg. Participants who
reported receiving only lifestyle advice had a mean DBP of
77mmHg while those reporting no physician intervention
had a mean DBP of 74mmHg.
Adherence to lifestyle modification counseling
Of the adult hypertensive population that received counseling,
88% reported adhering to those recommendations. The major-
ity reported adhering to the advice of reducing dietary sodium
85%, 77% adhered to weight loss advice, 75% adhered to
reducing their alcohol intake, 59% adhered to increasing their
exercise level and none claimed adherence to smoking cessa-
tion advice.
In unadjusted analyses, participants who were >60 years of
age, had a usual place of care, were Medicaid recipients, or had
diabetes reported the highest rates of adherence (Table 2). In
addition, non-Hispanic blacks more often reported adherence
when compared to Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.
After adjustment for demographic and clinical characteris-
tics, sociodemographic differences in adherence to counseling
persisted with, participants who were >60 years of age and
non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to report adhering when
advised compared to non-Hispanic whites (Table 3).
Participants who reported adherence to lifestyle modifi-
cation counseling had higher mean SBPs. The mean SBP of
those who reported compliance was 136 vs. 133 for those who
reported noncompliance (P = 0.002). The mean DBP of those
who reported being compliant was 74 vs. 75 for those who
reported noncompliance (P = 0.46). Of adherent participants,
91% took medication while 81% of the nonadherents took
medications.
In addition, there were modest differences in SBP and DBP
across type of participant reported adherence. The mean SBP
for adherence to medication advice alone was 139mmHg,
133mmHg for adherence to lifestyle advice alone and
137mmHg for those adhering to both therapeuric modali-
ties (P = 0.09). The mean DBP for medication adherence alone
was 71mmHg, 77mmHg for receipt for adherence to lifestyle

Discussion
Current guidelines recommend that all patients with the diag-
nosis of hypertension receive lifestyle recommendations with
or without pharmacological treatment. Our study has several
major findings. In our sample, representing 42.7 million adult
hypertensive individuals in the United States, we found high
rates of lifestyle counseling among men, non-Hispanic blacks,
those with Medicare insurance and especially in those with
clinical comorbidities. However, we also found that significant
gaps exist in lifestyle counseling for young adult hyperten-
sive patients and those hypertensive patients who have fewer
comorbid cardiovascular risks. After multivariate adjustment,
only non-Hispanic blacks and those aged >60 were more likely
to report adhering when advised. In addition, participants
with the highest SBPs were more likely to report only medica-
tion advice and those with the lowest SBPs were more likely to
report only lifestyle advice.
It is well known that diabetes, obesity, and elevated cho-
lesterol are all associated with increased morbidity and mor-
tality. In addition, being overweight has now been shown to
have deleterious effects.24­27 Although a high rate of overall
lifestyle counseling was reported by the participants, we found
significant differences in lifestyle counseling rates by clinical
characteristics.20,28,29 We found that adults with hypertension
and who were overweight or obese, diabetic, or with elevated
cholesterol were more likely to report receiving lifestyle modi-
fication counseling. This is consistent with a previous study
finding that diabetic patients are more likely to get more CVD
prevention services than nondiabetic patients.30 A recent
study of physician behavior demonstrates that the quality of
care actually increases as the patient's number of chronic con-
ditions increases.31 However, it has also been shown that rates
of recommendations for lifestyle interventions are suboptimal
among low cardiovascular risk patients.21 This is consistent
with our findings that significant gaps exist in lifestyle coun-
seling for patients who have not yet developed comorbid con-
ditions or target organ damage and interventions to improve
these rates should be studied.
Higher rates of counseling by health-care providers are
indicative of closer guideline adherence and point to an
improvement in the quality of hypertension care nation-
ally.2 Both sixth and seventh report of the Joint National
Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and
Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines recommend
lifestyle counseling for all hypertensive patients regardless of
their BP range.14,22 Although there was a high level of life-
style counseling in certain groups of patients in our study,
Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guide-
lines appeared to be followed unevenly by physicians. In our
analysis, participants reported their physicians were more
likely to prescribe only medication advice for those with the
highest SBPs and only lifestyle advice to those with the low-
est SBPs. For patients with the highest SBPs, providers may
be starting patients directly on medication because their BP
was more poorly controlled at baseline. However, because
of the cross-sectional design of NHANES, it is not possible
to ascertain the causal effects of BP on physicians' lifestyle
recommendations.

Adherence to guidelines may improve patient outcomes
through the elimination of practice variation not based on
current evidence. Multiple studies, including physician and
patient surveys, have demonstrated varying levels of physi-
cian adherence to hypertension guidelines.15­21 Most have
documented low levels of guideline adherence. However, the
majority of these studies focus on the use of pharmacological
therapy while our study focuses on lifestyle modification. In
addition, one study has shown poor physician knowledge of
lifestyle recommendations.21
After multivariable adjustment, non-Hispanic blacks
reported higher rates of adherence when compared to non-
Hispanic whites. This finding is consistent with previous stud-
ies using nationally representative data.29,32 This high rate of
adherence may represent true self-perceived adherence efforts
and a high degree of self-motivation and participation with
their health providers.33 Patients counseled by physicians to
modify behavior are more confident and motivated and may
be more successful.33­36 The high rate of adherence could also
represent acquiescent-response tendency. Previous studies
have documented that non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics are
more likely to answer affirmatively to yes/no questions regard-
less of question content or phrasing.37,38
Our study found that participants who reported adherence
to lifestyle modification counseling, 91% of whom were tak-
ing medication, had higher mean SBPs compared to those who
reported receiving counseling but did not adhere. These find-
ings are consistent with previous national studies showing low
hypertension control and room for improvement, even among
patients treated for hypertension.1­4,7 One possible explana-
tion for this association may be that patients with poorly con-
trolled BP are more motivated to adhere to recommended
lifestyle changes. Alternatively, these findings may also repre-
sent patients who are not yet at goal but require multiple thera-
peutic interventions for BP control.
Previous trials have demonstrated that despite a general
assumption that older individuals are "set in their ways," age
did not affect the ability to make lifestyle changes.39 Our anal-
ysis highlights that younger patients (<60 years) are less likely
to adhere. This is an important intervention point in light of
the increasing burden of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity
in younger age groups. In addition, this patient population has
a longer period of time to develop serious end organ damage
from these comorbidities.
NHANES has been routinely used to provide an estimate of
patients' activities and may reflect the patients' understanding
of their medical care.1,3­5 However, there are several limita-
tions to this study. Given that NHANES is a cross-sectional
survey, we are only able to test factors associated with receipt
and adherence to lifestyle recommendations but are unable to
establish causality. In addition, the NHANES questions do not
allow determination of when in the clinical course of hyperten-
sion management the participant received lifestyle counseling.
Because of participant self-report, recall failure and biases may
have been introduced. Furthermore, we do not have detailed
information on the appropriateness, content, or intensity of
counseling, nor do we have data on use of ancillary services
(e.g., case managers and registered dietitians) by participants.
In this nationally representative data set, we found high
rates of lifestyle counseling by health-care providers for hyper-
tensive patients especially for those with the highest cardio-
vascular risks. However, after multivariate adjustment, only
non-Hispanic blacks and those aged >60 were more likely to
report adhering when advised. Increasing both physician and
patient adherence to lifestyle modification guidelines will be an
essential first step and merits further investigation. In light of
these findings, population-wide adoption of healthy lifestyles is
critical to reduce the societal burden of CVD and its sequelae.
Furthermore, policy makers and health advocates should focus
on developing programs targeting young adults with hyperten-
sion given their low adherence rates, as they have a significantly
increasing rate of hypertension and related disorders.
