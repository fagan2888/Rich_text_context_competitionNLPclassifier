The Origins of Better Jobs Better Care
Robyn I. Stone, DrPH,1 and Steven L. Dawson2
Better Jobs Better Care was the nation's largest single
initiative created to reduce the high vacancy and
turnover rates of direct care workers and improve
workforce quality through both policy and practice
changes. In this article, we describe the important
role and key characteristics of direct care workers,
what motivated the unique partnership between
a provider association and a direct care worker
advocacy organization to create this initiative, and
how the initiative was designed to respond to the key
challenges through applied research and demonstra-
tion projects. We conclude by discussing how BJBC
has influenced providers, policy makers, and direct
care workers to think about these frontline caregivers,
who are the crux of the long-term care workforce.
Key Words: Direct care worker turnover, Direct
care worker retention, Quality improvement,
Quality workforce, Workforce improvement
Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC) was a large-scale,
multistate demonstration, applied research, and
evaluation program funded between 2002 and 2006
by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the
Atlantic Philanthropies. Over the past 4 years, BJBC
represented the nation's largest single initiative to
improve the recruitment and retention of a quality,
sustainable direct care workforce in the long-term
care sector. (Kemper, Brannon, Barry, Stott, &
Heier, this special issue, provide a detailed de-
scription of this program.)
The purpose of this article is to describe the
origins and development of this combined prac-
tice- and policy-based initiative and, in particular,
why and how a national long-term care provider
association (the American Association of Homes
and Services for the Aging) and the nation's
leading advocacy and technical assistance organi-
zation for direct care workers (the Paraprofes-
sional Healthcare Institute [PHI]) partnered to
help create and implement this groundbreaking
effort. The article begins by describing the
important role and key characteristics of direct
care workers (DCWs) in long-term care and then
highlights three key issues that motivated the
partnership and the evolution of BJBC. Following
this is a summary of the challenges that the
demonstration/research program was intended to
address and a discussion of how the BJBC initia-
tive was designed to respond to these problems
through its demonstration and applied research.
The article concludes with a brief summary of
how BJBC influenced the view of the DCW issue
at both policy and practice levels and what the
implications are for future efforts to support and
sustain this critical segment of the long-term care
workforce.
Who Are the DCWs?
DCWs--nursing assistants, home health and
home care aides, personal care workers, and
personal service attendants--form the centerpiece
of the formal long-term care system (Stone &
Weiner, 2001). These so-called frontline caregivers
provide hands-on care to millions of elderly and
younger people with disabilities in settings ranging
from the nursing home, to assisted living and other
residential care options, to private homes. DCWs
provide 8 out of every 10 hr of paid care received by
a long-term care consumer and are often referred to
as the ``eyes and the ears'' of the care system (PHI,
2001). In addition to helping with activities of daily
living (e.g., bathing, dressing, using the toilet, and
eating), these workers provide the ``high touch'' that
is essential to quality of life, as well as quality of
care, for elders and chronically disabled individuals.
In 2000, there were an estimated 1.4 million
nursing aides employed in nursing home and
residential care settings; another 615,000 DCWs
The Better Jobs Better Care National Program--including the
demonstration and research grants and the national evaluation--was
funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Atlantic
Philanthropies. We extend a special thanks to the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation for its generous support of this special issue of The
Gerontologist. We would also like to thank the staff of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant
Secretary of Planning and Evaluation/ Disability, Aging and Long Term
Care Policy for its support in the development of the national program. In
addition, we express our sincere gratitude to Mary Harahan, who worked
with us in helping to make the Better Jobs Better Care vision a reality.

were home health aides employed in home- and
community-based settings (Center for California
Health Workforce Studies, 2006). A study of the
demographic characteristics of DCWs, using data
from the 2000 Census, indicates that the median age
of nursing home aides is 36 years. Home care aides
are somewhat older, with a median age of 46 years
(Montgomery, Holley, Deichert, & Kosloski, 2005).
The vast majority of DCWs are female--91.3% of
nursing home aides and 91.8% of home care aides.
Three out of five nursing home aides and two thirds
of home care aides are not married. A little more
than one quarter of those employed in nursing
homes and one third of those working in home care
have not completed high school. Many of these
women are likely to be single mothers who are
supporting their families with one relatively low
income while balancing their job (and sometimes
more than one job) with child care and other family
responsibilities. These conflicting pressures may
contribute to absenteeism and affect the quality of
the worker's job performance and commitment to
the work.
There is much ethnic and racial diversity among
DCWs. Although a little more than half of nursing
home and home care aides are White, 31% of those
employed in nursing homes and 26% of those
employed in home care settings are African Amer-
ican. Almost 8% of nursing home aides and 16% of
home care aides are Hispanic. In addition, 14% of
nursing home aides and almost 1 out of 4 home care
aides are foreign born. The wide variation in
ethnicity and cultures represented among staff in
long-term care settings heightens the potential for
tension, miscommunication, and conflict between
caregivers and care recipients, between peers, and
between supervisors and DCWs (McDonald, 2007;
Parker, 2006). This increased diversity underscores
the need for improving the English-language skills of
many workers and building cultural competence
knowledge and skills into formal and on-the-job
training programs for DCWs and managers.
Motivation for Developing BJBC
Historically, concerns about DCWs in long-term
care have ebbed and flowed, with the issue gaining
greater attention during relatively prosperous eco-
nomic times when employers compete for workers--
and thus staff (who might otherwise be employed by
the long-term care industry) find other, more
attractive job options. During the late 1990s, such
a period of low unemployment left many long-term
care employers of DCWs not only with high rates of
turnover (which is typical in the industry) but also
with high vacancy rates. The latter in particular
caused both providers and policy makers to pay
increased attention to how direct care jobs were
failing to compete within a suddenly competitive job
market--admittedly more out of concern for how
these vacancies were impacting consumers and the
providers themselves, but nonetheless resulting in
a renewed interest in how to find and keep DCWs.
Shortly thereafter, PHI and the Institute for the
Future of Aging Services (IFAS; the research arm of the
American Association of Homes and Services for the
Aging) partnered to create a greater awarenessamong,
and an evidence base for, policy makers and providers
about the need for a more systemic approach to
developing and sustaining DCWs. Both PHI and IFAS
based their heightened efforts on the premise that,
although the then-current spike in vacancy rates was
indeed exacerbated by the full-employment economy,
the underlying U.S. demographics of both the long-
term care consumers (demand for services) and the
health care workers (supply of labor) would combine
in the future to make the resulting ``care gap'' not
simply an episodic byproduct of occasional strong
economies but a permanent crisis for the future of
caregiving. (The U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 2003, later reinforced this premise
about future supply and demand projections in
a report to Congress.)
PHI, a policy and technical assistance organization
for direct care issues, approached the issue primarily
from a workforce development perspective: Based on
a ``quality care through quality jobs'' analysis, PHI
focused particularly on improving the financial,
educational, and workplace dimensions of direct
care employment so that DCWs would have the
training, support, and stability to provide high-
quality care. IFAS was interested in furthering this
issue because of the DCWs' integral place in the long-
term care system. Furthermore, both organizations
were committed to helping to advance the evidence
base that would support changes in practice and
policy. Several key issues motivated their partnership.
Workforce Improvement as a Long-Term Care
Quality Issue
Over the past 20 years, there has been increasing
interest in and concern about the quality of care
being provided in nursing homes and other long-
term care settings (Noelker & Harel, 2001;
Wunderlich & Kohler, 2001). However, prior to
2000, much of the policy, practice, and research
activity focused on how to improve quality outcomes
for residents and home care clients through a range
of regulatory and, more recently, quality improve-
ment activities. With the exception of entry-level
certification requirements for nursing home and home
health aides, the performance of the DCW was
usually an afterthought in those discussions of long-
term care quality (Stone, Dawson, & Harahan, 2004).
A 2001 Institute of Medicine report, however,
identified workforce development as one of its nine
guiding principles and acknowledged that quality of
6 The Gerontologist
care depends largely on the performance of the
caregiving workforce (Wunderlich & Kohler, 2001).
Until recently, most of the discussion of workforce
issues had focused on achieving minimum staffing
levels for nurses and DCWs: A major nursing home
staffing study indicated that, to maximize quality of
care, a nursing home would need to provide 2.78 hr
of nurse aide care per resident day, substantially
more than the current average of 2.02 hr of aide care
per day (Abt Associates, 2003). The 2001 Institute of
Medicine report, however, also emphasized that an
adequate staffing level is a necessary, but not
sufficient, condition for positively affecting the
quality of life and quality of care of consumers. A
more recent Institute of Medicine (2004) study
focused specifically on transforming nurse practice
emphasized that organizations must not only have
adequate numbers of staff, but must also create work
environments that help retain nurses and nursing
assistants. The study highlighted the importance of
both orientation programs for newly hired staff and
continuing education for existing staff.
At the time planning for BJBC began, there
existed only limited empirical evidence directly
linking the performance of DCWs (and the factors
that contribute to effective worker performance)
with resident-/client-level quality-of-care and
quality-of-life outcomes. Nevertheless, government
and media reports did suggest that high turnover
among nursing home and home care aides could
negatively affect the quality of the services delivered
and the quality of life provided in nursing homes,
assisted living settings, and home-based settings
(Leon, Marainen, & Marotte, 2001; U.S. Govern-
ment Accountability Office, 1999). Interviews con-
ducted as part of a study of turnover and retention in
not-for-profit California nursing homes indicated
that, although all of the participating facilities had
more than adequate staffing ratios, many of the
administrators and supervisory staff felt that the
largest obstacle to delivering high-quality care was
the need to constantly accommodate DCW vacancies
(Harahan et al., 2003).
Also, in an earlier study, Schnelle and colleagues
(1993) developed and evaluated the effects of
a quality improvement program in which nursing
assistants were trained in how to reduce inconti-
nence, how to collect and analyze data, and how to
track their own performance relative to the residents
for whom they were responsible. Seven of the eight
participating nursing homes experienced significant
increases in resident dryness and maintained this
improvement over a 6-month follow-up. Eaton
(2001) documented reductions in mortality and
pharmaceutical use and increases in resident func-
tioning after the introduction of innovative organi-
zational programs that improved the work
environment of nursing home aides. These models
included the development of self-managed work
teams, improved information sharing between nurses
and direct care staff, and enhanced responsibilities
for DCWs. In their evaluation of the Wellspring
nursing home quality improvement program, Stone
and colleagues (2002) found that the empowerment
of the DCWs, including their significant participa-
tion in care planning and care plan implementation,
was associated with reduced turnover, a reduction in
health deficiency citations from state surveyors, and
a decrease in incontinence rates. Researchers in-
volved in a national nursing home staffing study
found a strong relationship between aide retention in
California nursing homes and select quality out-
comes (Kramer, Eilertsen, Lin, & Hutt, 2000). For
short-stay nursing home residents, the study found
a strong negative association between retention rates
and both electrolyte imbalances and urinary tract
infection rates. Aide retention rates also affected the
functional status and pressure ulcer rates of long-
stay residents.
Workforce Improvement as an Economic
Development Issue
The second major issue driving this interest in the
recruitment and retention of a quality, stable direct
care workforce is the potential for these occupa-
tions to contribute to the economic development of
communities across the country--assuming, of
course, that the overall quality of these jobs
(including wages, benefits, and career opportunities)
is improved. Given the aging of the U.S. population
over the next 40 years and increased longevity among
younger people with disabilities, the long-term care
sector will undoubtedly be a growth industry. In
2000, approximately 13 million Americans needed
long-term care. By 2050, the number is expected to
increase to 27 million; the population aged 85 and
older--those most at risk for needing long-term
care--is expected to increase fivefold (U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human Services, 2003).
Although it is difficult to predict the level of
family caregiving that will be available and relied on
in the future, projections of wealth patterns among
elderly Americans in 2015 and 2030 indicate that real
income and liquid (nonhousing) assets will increase
greatly between 2000 and 2030 (Knickman, Hunt,
Snell, Alexcih, & Kennell, 2003). These estimates
suggest that many individuals needing long-term care
will prefer and be able to pay for services (Center for
California Health Workforce Studies, 2006). Fur-
thermore, to the extent that more baby boomers are
motivated to purchase long-term care insurance, this
is almost certain to stimulate increased demand for
paid services--especially at home and in residential
alternatives to nursing homes.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2006) esti-
mated that employment of DCWs in long-term care
settings in the next 10 years will grow faster than
health care employment in general and 3 times as fast
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 7
as all industries. During the coming decade, there will
be an increase of 35% in jobs for nursing assistants,
home health and home care aides, and personal care
workers. Including both new jobs and replacement
jobs for retiring workers and those who leave the
occupation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects
that almost 1 million new DCWs will be needed
between 2004 and 2014 (Hecker, 2004). The demand
for DCWs in home- and community-based settings is
projected to grow even higher than for nursing homes:
The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 41% increase
in the demand for home care and personal care aides
and a 56% increase in the demand for home health
aides over the 10-year period (Hecker, 2004; U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2006).
Although the projections farther out into the future
are more equivocal, the demographic trends suggest
that the demands on the long-term care sector will
create many job opportunities, particularly in com-
munities that are becoming disproportionately elderly
because younger people have moved out (e.g., in many
rural areas), substantial numbers of elders have aged
in place (e.g., in many inner cities), or elderly
individuals have migrated to retirement destinations.
Workforce improvement efforts that help to create
more valuable, attractive jobs for young people as
well as older people looking for second careers can
positively affect the economic health of many
communities and regions across the country.
Workforce Improvement as a Moral Imperative
Despite the critical role that DCWs play in the
long-term care system, they are among the lowest
wage earners in the United States. In 2000, the year
that we began to develop the BJBC initiative, the
median hourly wage for DCWs was $8.21 (PHI,
2003). Five years later, in 2005, the median hourly
wage for DCWs had risen to $9.56 (PHI, 2006b). The
median annual income of a nursing home aide in
2000 was $13,265; the comparable figure for a home
care aide was $12,265. These incomes were below
the federal poverty level for a family of four, which
was $16,700 in 2000.
These low wages may encourage DCWs to leave
the long-term care or health care fields. One study in
North Carolina found that nursing aides who had
left jobs in the health sector were better off
financially than those who remained in the field
(Konrad, 2003). The study compared North Carolina
workers trained as nursing aides who remained
certified as aides with those who did not remain
certified. Among those who had not been certified as
aides since 1990, the median 1998 wage was $14,425
compared to $11,358 for actively certified nursing
aides. The median wage of those no longer certified
rose to $17,359 in 2001, whereas the comparable
wage increase for currently certified aides was
$12,877. Although wages increased slightly in North
Carolina over the 4-year period, median wages
remained substantially lower for those still certified
compared with those who had left the field.
This financially disadvantaged status is exacer-
bated by the lack of health coverage experienced by
a large portion of these caregivers: 1 in every 4
nursing assistants and more than 2 out of 5 home
care workers lack health insurance coverage (Lip-
son & Regan, 2004). DCWs are uninsured at a rate
that is 50% higher than the general population
younger than age 65, and nursing home workers are
twice as likely to be uninsured than hospital
workers (Case, Himmelstein, & Woolhandler,
2002). Furthermore, coinsurance premiums for
workers in long-term care can be as much as 50%
of the total premium (Michigan Assisted Living
Association, 2001). For low-wage workers, this
makes offering health coverage meaningless because
it is unaffordable.
These workers also face strenuous physical
demands and high job-related injury rates compared
to other health- and non-health-related industries:
13.9 employees per 100 employees in nursing homes
and personal care facilities had a workplace injury in
2000 compared to 5.3 employees per 100 in eating
and drinking places or 9.1 per 100 in hospitals
(Service Employees International Union, 1999). The
nursing home aide occupation ranks second only to
truck driver in the federal government's list of
dangerous professions (Service Employees Interna-
tional Union, 1999). Car accidents pose the greatest
danger for home care workers.
In addition to this disadvantaged status, these
workers--who provide up to three quarters of all
long-term care--have few opportunities for job
advancement and upgrading of their skills. There
is, furthermore, often a stigma associated with being
a DCW, particularly a home care aide or personal
care attendant, such that one is frequently referred to
as a ``girl'' or viewed as simply a domestic worker--
``the maid'' (PHI, 2003).
Given the very low quality of and value attributed
to these jobs, Friedland (2004) noted that
it could reasonably be argued that our long-term care
system--paid primarily by public tax dollars--has
an obligation to create jobs that provide a livable
wage; that our publicly funded health system has
a responsibility, at the very least, to provide its own
workers with health insurance. (p. 7)
Friedland went on to lament that moral persuasion
alone has failed to offer significant improvements in
the quality of direct care jobs. We agree with this
sentiment and believe that there is a moral imper-
ative to improve the recruitment and retention of
DCWs in long-term care by supporting public
policies and educational and provider practices that
help to elevate these jobs to recognized, valued
professions.
8 The Gerontologist
The Current Problem
Across the country, long-term care providers
report DCW vacancies and high turnover rates.
Nursing homes, assisted living and other residential
care providers, home health agencies, community-
based home care and adult day programs, and
individuals and their families all indicate that they
experience difficulties in recruiting and, more impor-
tant, retaining frontline caregivers (PHI, 2001;
Stone & Weiner, 2001). This workforce problem
was the pivotal issue that motivated BJBC's two
funders--the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and
the Atlantic Philanthropies--to invest in the national
demonstration and applied research program.
Nationally, data on turnover rates show wide
variation ranging from 40% to 100% annually
(American Health Care Association, 2003; PHI,
2001). Most states--major stakeholders in financing
(via Medicaid) and regulating the long-term care
sector--identified DCW recruitment and retention as
a major policy concern in 1999 when the United
States was experiencing very low rates of unemploy-
ment and there was great competition for workers at
the local level (NCDHHS, 1999). Even with increases
in unemployment rates, however, states continue to
view these long-term care workforce issues as
priorities (PHI and North Carolina Department of
Health and Human Services Office of Long-Term
Care, 2004).
High staff turnover and vacancies have negative
effects on the major stakeholders within the long-
term care system: workers, consumers (including
their families), long-term care providers, and third-
party payers--primarily the Medicaid and Medicare
programs (PHI, 2001; Stone & Weiner, 2001).
Turnover is expensive, although a dearth of studies
has attempted to quantify the per-worker costs of
frontline turnover in different long-term care set-
tings. Seavey (2004) conducted a meta-analysis of the
literature and concluded that a minimum direct cost
of turnover per worker is at least $2,500. Most of the
studies she reviewed (Straker & Atchley, 1999;
Waldman, 2004) estimated the costs of separation
and vacancy, hiring, training, and increased worker
injuries. Seavey noted, however, that the indirect
costs of turnover (lost productivity until the re-
placement is trained, reduced service quality, lost
revenues, lost clients to other agencies, deterioration
in organizational culture and employee morale) may
be substantial and tend to be overlooked because
they are less visible and harder to measure.
In addition, turnover and vacancies are costly not
only to providers but also to consumers (through
reduction in quality of care and life and care hours
not received) and to workers (through increased
worker injuries, increased physical and emotional
stress, deterioration in working conditions, and
increased likelihood of quitting). Compromised
care quality can result in deterioration of the
resident/long-term care client's health or functional
condition, which in turn leads to increased transfers
to more expensive, higher acuity settings, unneces-
sary emergency visits and hospital stays, and even
higher mortality (Kosel & Olivo, 2002; Seavey,
2004). Such adverse outcomes have a ripple effect
and inevitably raise costs to third-party payers
(primarily Medicaid and Medicare). These down-
stream medical costs ultimately are borne by citizens
whose tax dollars support the public programs that
finance long-term care (PHI, 2001; Seavey, 2004;
Stone & Weiner, 2001).
The Long-Term Outlook
As noted earlier, the unprecedented increase in the
size and proportion of the elderly population and the
growth in the nonelderly disabled population will
increase the demand for DCWs across all long-term
care settings. There is, however, serious concern
about the availability of these caregivers in the
future. In the coming decades, as baby boomers enter
old age and begin to require assistance, the pool of
workers available to provide basic long-term care
services will fail to keep up with demand (Feldman,
1997; PHI, 2001; Stone & Weiner, 2001). That is, the
number of potential entry-level workers who tradi-
tionally fill direct care jobs--women aged 25 to 54 in
the civilian workforce--is projected to increase by
only 3.2% during the next 7 years (U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics, 2006). This tightening of the
traditional labor pool is caused by the baby boom
generation having passed through this age range, and
the slowed rate of increased participation of women
in the workplace.
The educational level among minority women--
those most likely to enter the direct care work-
force--is also improving dramatically. Although the
educational status of both White and Black women
improved substantially over the past several decades,
the increase was most striking for the latter group.
Between 1990 and 2007, for example, the proportion
of Black women aged 25 or older with at least a high
school education increased from 66.5% to 82.6%;
the proportion with 4 years or more of college
increased from 10.8% to 19% (U.S. Census Bureau,
2008). These more educated women will be less
willing to work in the same low-wage, low-benefit
jobs than those who preceded them.
The Response: Design of the BJBC Initiative
In response to the caregiving, economic develop-
ment, and moral challenges presented by the
emerging care gap, IFAS and PHI engaged with the
two national philanthropic organizations during
2002 to design BJBC. This program, funded at
$15.5 million over 4 years, would soon become the
largest frontline health care staffing initiative in the
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 9
country. The initiative took shape with two primary
components: (a) a five-state, field-based demonstra-
tion program; and (b) a set of applied research
initiatives resulting in eight studies that comple-
mented, but were distinct from, the five-state
demonstration.
Design of the Five-State Demonstration
The premise of the demonstration program was
threefold:
 Poor recruitment strategies and high rates of turnover
had resulted in an unstable direct care workforce that
was thus hampered in providing ``better care.''
 The causes of these recruitment and retention
problems were many--no single solution was avail-
able to create ``better jobs''--and thus interventions
had to be tested at both the practice level and the
policy level.
 Greater evidence of effective interventions was
required to convince both providers and policy
makers to invest in solutions addressing the emerging
care gap.
IFAS and PHI, in consultation with the national
funders, shaped the demonstration program to test
a proposed ``theory of change.'' This theory of
change posited that the greatest and most lasting
improvements in recruitment and retention were
most likely to occur if the following six program
features were included.
State-Based Demonstrations.--Long-term care
systems are primarily influenced by Medicaid re-
imbursement policy, eligibility requirements and
program design, state regulations, and training and
educational requirements that differ significantly by
state. The developers of the BJBC national program,
therefore, required the demonstration to be state
based, although not located within the state
government. The five successful applicants were all
statewide initiatives.
Key Stakeholder Engagement.--The design of
the demonstration required that organized represen-
tatives of the key nongovernmental stakeholders
within long-term care--consumers, provider/em-
ployers, and workers--work together to forge
common solutions. Therefore, an essential design
element was that each state initiative include at the
onset credible organizations representing at least two
of those three key stakeholders, and that successful
applicants present a plan to engage as soon as
practical organizations representing all three stake-
holders. Also, although the funders chose not to
allow any governmental units to be lead grant
recipients, the program designers expected successful
applicants to present strategies that would directly
engage state and local governmental leaders--
particularly in their efforts to change public policy.
Existing Leadership and Momentum.--The de-
signers of this national program recognized that
success would be more likely in states where there
already existed some activity, leadership, and
momentum toward addressing recruitment and
retention issues. Therefore, they selected applicants
in part on the degree to which they could
demonstrate that efforts were underway and that
their BJBC project would build on this preexisting
momentum.
Proactive Worker Involvement.--Given the piv-
otal role that DCWs play in delivering long-term
care services, and the program's interest in strength-
ening the voice of the DCW, the designers required
that, at the very least, DCWs be proactively engaged
in the governance of the proposed project. Successful
applicants included workers on their advisory
boards; several fielded educational programs that
included the voices of both consumers and workers;
and two sites developed worker associations as part
of their array of interventions.
Multifaceted Intervention Approach.--The pro-
gram encouraged state-based initiatives to address
a broad range of implementation strategies, in-
cluding both practice-based initiatives (directly
working inside the agencies and facilities of employ-
ers/providers) and policy-based initiatives (reform-
ing public regulatory, finance, or funding criteria in
long-term care, aging, workforce development, or
educational programs). As a corollary, the designers
did not require any particular array of solutions,
presuming that each state was distinct, and thus the
most effective ``cocktail'' of solutions would likely be
tailored by the unique combination of state-based
stakeholders working together.
Multiple Settings.--The proposed solutions were
applied across a range of long-term care provider
types and settings--including nursing homes, assisted
living facilities, adult day care centers, home care
agencies, and independent home care provider
programs. Although each of these provider types
exists within unique funding ``silos'' and is subject to
differing regulatory and finance environments, direct
care positions are somewhat similar across these
settings and draw from much of the same labor pool.
Interventions, therefore, were likely to be effective in
multiple settings.
At the same time, the designers also assumed that
differing silos create warring political factions
among providers, consumers, and worker/labor
organizations, which in turn impede change. There-
fore, the designers posited that if the walls of
misperception between these factions could be
10 The Gerontologist
lowered and ``win­wins'' could be created for all
stakeholders by working together within the BJBC
program, greater success and potential for sustain-
ability across all of the silos might result.
Based on these design assumptions and features,
the designers distributed widely two requests for
proposals--one soliciting proposals for applied
research projects that examined various aspects of
workforce improvement in long-term care, and the
other soliciting proposals to develop state-based
demonstrations. A National Advisory Committee
appointed by the two foundations reviewed more
than 200 research proposals and recommended
funding for eight applied research projects. The
Committee also recommended funding for 5 out of
the 220 demonstration proposals they reviewed. The
overwhelming response to both of the requests for
proposals underscored the interest in and concern
about this workforce issue among state stakeholders
and researchers across the country.
The Applied Research Projects
Six of the eight applied research grantees were
university-based, one was located within a provider-
based research center, and another was based
within a workforce development program. Two
projects focused on the role of various aspects of
leadership, work design, and relationships between
and across staff and residents in improving work-
place outcomes in nursing homes. One grantee
developed and evaluated the effectiveness of a cul-
tural competency assessment and training tool in
helping to create a healthier work environment for
DCWs. Two other grantees assessed the role of
tailored and ongoing training programs in improv-
ing job satisfaction and reducing turnover in the
long-term care sector. Another grantee examined
the effects of improved wages and benefits on the
likelihood of home care workers entering and
staying in the job. The final two grantees explored
issues related to expanding the labor pool of DCWs,
including the potential for older adults and family
caregivers to enter this labor market. Summaries of
the applied research projects supported by the
national program are on the BJBC website
(www.bjbc.org). In addition, specific articles related
to these research projects are published elsewhere in
this special issue of The Gerontologist.
The State Demonstration Policy and
Practice Solutions
The National Advisory Committee awarded
grants averaging $1.4 million each to the following
five lead nonprofit agencies: the Iowa CareGivers
Association, the CCommunity of Vermont Elders,
the North Carolina Foundation for Advanced Health
Programs, the Oregon Works! Coalition, and the
Pennsylvania-based Center for Advocacy for the
Rights and Interests of the Elderly.
Each of the demonstration states eventually
crafted a unique cocktail of policy and practice
responses. Although none of the demonstration
programs had the resources to consider a fully
comprehensive solution to recruitment and reten-
tion, taken together the BJBC programs addressed
what we consider to be nine essential elements of
a quality job program for DCWs (PHI, 2006a). These
nine elements fall within the three broad categories
of compensation, opportunity for advancement, and
organizational support (see Table 1).
Within the demonstration sites, these essential
elements were reflected in practice-based initiatives,
such as a peer mentor program in Iowa, supervisory
training in Oregon, and leadership training and
team-building activities in Pennsylvania. They were
also reflected in policy-based initiatives, such as the
New Organizational Vision Award licensure pro-
gram in North Carolina, state-funded long-range
needs analysis for DCWs across settings in Vermont,
and the infusion of person-centered care into the
state nurse aide and nurse training requirements in
Oregon. The efficacy of these initiatives, although
still being assessed, is reported on by researchers
from The Pennsylvania State University's Depart-
ment of Health Policy and Administration, the
evaluators of the BJBC program (see Kemper,
Brannon, Barry, Stoot, & Heier, this issue).
Conclusion
Since the inception of BJBC, issues related to the
availability of and quality of the direct care work-
force have received increasing attention by policy
makers at the federal and state levels, providers,
consumer and worker organizations, and research-
ers. We believe that this national program, with the
foundations' generous support and imprimatur,
helped to catalyze this increased attention. During
the past 4 years, the current status and future of the
direct care workforce was the subject of two national
provider-sponsored long-term care commissions
(Biles et al., 2005; Harahan & Stone, 2007), and it
is a major focus of the current National Campaign
for Quality Nursing Homes. The Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services required workforce
improvement activities and outcome measures to be
developed and implemented in the eighth scope of
work of the Quality Improvement Organizations, the
groups with which it contracts in each state to work
with nursing homes and home health agencies on
quality improvement initiatives. Many state-based
culture change coalitions have recognized the crucial
role of direct care workforce improvement in
ensuring that change actually occurs and is sustained
within nursing homes and other long-term care
settings. The U.S. Department of Labor and its state
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 11
and local counterparts have invested significant new
dollars in the development of training and appren-
ticeship programs for the direct care workforce
employed in long-term care settings.
As the BJBC national program comes to a close,
we and the participants in this initiative face several
challenges. As is discussed in more detail in this
special issue, the research projects and demonstra-
tion sites have produced many findings, lessons
learned, and concrete products and tools (e.g., peer
mentoring programs, supervisory and cultural com-
petence training programs, model DCW and su-
pervisor curricula, model occupational profiles,
workforce improvement assessment tools, legislative
and administrative changes at the state level) that
need to be disseminated and replicated across the
country at the practice and policy levels.
One major challenge for the demonstration
coalitions, participating providers, worker and
consumer associations, and policy makers will be
to sustain their successes and to help diffuse their
efforts beyond their own organizations and states.
The national program partners also have a commit-
ment to and responsibility for designing and
implementing dissemination strategies to share the
successes and failures of BJBC with a diverse
audience and to promote replication of the most
promising practices and policy changes.
Over the 4-year grant period, BJBC helped to raise
the visibility of DCWs, gave them a voice, and made
some important inroads toward developing better
jobs and producing better care for this country's
aging population. The practice, policy, and research
communities now must build on that momentum to
help create and sustain a quality long-term care
workforce today and in the future.
