Introduction
The two most common forms of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) are Crohn's disease (CD)
and ulcerative colitis (UC). Both are chronic,
immune-mediated inflammatory disorders of the
gastrointestinal tract, characterized by abdominal
pain, rectal bleeding, diarrhoea and fatigue.1­3 In
2012, CD was reported to affect between 319
(North America) and 322 (Europe) people per
100,000, and UC between 249 (North America)
and 505 (Europe) people per 100,000, with the
prevalence of both diseases reported to be increas-
ing in both regions.4
Agents currently approved for the treatment of
IBD include 5-aminosalicylic acid, corticoster-
oids, methotrexate (MTX), the thiopurines
azathioprine and mercaptopurine and biologic
therapies targeting tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-alpha and integrins.5­7 Both the American
College of Gastroenterology and European
Crohn's and Colitis Organisation guidelines advise
that treatment should be tailored to the individual,
considering disease severity and location, with bio-
logic therapies considered for those with moderate
to severe disease who do not respond to, or are
intolerant of, conventional therapy.5­9
Immunogenicity of biologics in inflammatory
bowel disease

Abstract: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders of the
gastrointestinal tract. Treatment options include biologic therapies; however, a proportion
of patients lose response to biologics, partly due to the formation of anti-drug antibodies
(ADAbs). Concomitant immunosuppressive agents reduce the development of ADAbs. This
review article aims to assess the immunogenicity of biologic therapies and their clinical
implications. A comprehensive literature search was conducted for articles published January
2009 to August 2015 reporting immunogenicity to adalimumab (ADM), certolizumab pegol
(CZP), golimumab, infliximab (IFX), ustekinumab, and vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). Eligible articles were reviewed and quality assessed by independent reviewers.
Overall, 122 publications reporting 114 studies were assessed. ADAbs were reported for
all agents, but the percentage of patients developing ADAbs was extremely variable, with
the highest (65.3%) being for IFX administration to patients with IBD. ADAb presence was
frequently associated with a reduction in primary efficacy and a loss of response, and, for
IFX, an increase in adverse events (AEs). Lower serum levels of ADM, CZP and IFX were
seen in ADAbs-positive rather than ADAbs-negative patients; pharmacokinetic data were
unavailable for other therapies. Little information was available regarding the timing of ADAb
development; studies reported their detection from as early as 10­14 days up to months after
treatment initiation. Biologic therapies carry an intrinsic risk of immunogenicity, although
reported rates of ADAbs vary considerably. The clinical implications of immunogenicity are a
concern for effective treatment; further research, particularly into the more recently approved
biologics, is required.

Systematic Review
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11 
2 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag
Although biologic therapies represent a major
advance in the treatment of IBD, and a high
proportion of patients with moderate or severe dis-
ease respond well to biologics, at least 30% of
patients fail to meet primary endpoints in clinical
trials,10,11 and a proportion of patients lose response
over time.12 Immunogenicity is recognized as a
leading contributor to the loss of response to biologic
therapies; as biologic agents are large, complex
proteins, they trigger the formation of anti-drug
antibodies (ADAbs) specific to the agent adminis-
tered.13 Therefore, it is recommended that patients
who develop ADAbs to a biologic therapy, with a
consequent loss of response, should switch to a dif-
ferent agent with either the same or a different
mechanism of action.14­16
Studies of the immunogenicity of biologics have
reported variability in the rate of formation of
ADAbs, and in the time post-exposure that
ADAbs develop, possibly due to differing immu-
nogenicity assay methodologies.13 A number of
different techniques with varying specificity, sensi-
tivity and cost are currently available to measure
ADAbs. Assay techniques include enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmu-
noassay (RIA) and electrochemi-luminescence
(ECL), with some methods optionally incorporat-
ing an acid-dissociation step to improve sensitivity
and increase the chances of detecting ADAbs even
in the presence of high levels of antigen.17­20
Aim
The objective of the current analysis was to evalu-
ate and contextualize the immunogenicity of
approved biologic therapies used to treat IBD in
order to understand the clinical implications of
the rate, timeline and impact of the development
of an immunogenic response to biologics.
Methods
The methodological approach was described in a
protocol and followed the recommendations and
standards required by the UK National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.
Literature search
A comprehensive search strategy was developed,
and online searches were conducted for relevant
articles published in the period January 2009 to
August 2015.
A number of electronic sources were searched:
Medline® and Embase® via the Ovid interface;
CochraneCentralRegisterofTrials(CENTRAL);
Cochrane Database of Systematic Review
(CDSR); NHS Economic Evaluation Database
(NHS EED); Health Technology Assessment
(HTA) Database; and Database of Abstracts of
Reviews of Effects (DARE) via the Cochrane
Library. In addition to the online search, key con-
gresses, published systematic literature reviews
(capturing suitable studies published prior to
2009) and the references in articles relevant to the
topic of interest were hand-searched. Details of
thesearchstrategiesareincludedasSupplementary
Tables 1 and 2.
Study eligibility and screening
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs
and observational studies of patients with CD or
UC were eligible. Case reports, case series, litera-
ture reviews, letters, commentaries and editorials
were excluded. Studies were included if they
reported data for the biologics adalimumab
(ADM), certolizumab pegol (CZP), golimumab
(GLM), infliximab (IFX), ustekinumab (UST)
and vedolizumab (VDM), administered to
patients with CD or UC either as monotherapy or
in combination with conventional therapy.
Abstracts identified from the online search were
screened for eligibility by a reviewer. A second,
independent reviewer checked 10% of screened
abstracts. Articles considered eligible were
obtained and subjected to full-text review; any
ineligible studies were excluded, with the ration-
ale for exclusion documented. A second inde-
pendent reviewer screened 20% of excluded
publications and all eligible publications; any dis-
crepancies between reviewers were resolved by
consensus.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Relevant information was defined at the start of
the study, and a data extraction table
(Supplementary Table 3) was developed to col-
lect information obtained on full review of the
selected articles. Selected articles were assessed
for quality in accordance with the recommended
methodology for systematic literature reviews.21
S Vermeire, A Gils et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3
One reviewer screened all citations and full-text
papers, which were then double-checked by an
independent reviewer. Likewise, data extraction
was conducted by a single reviewer, and subse-
quently validated by an independent reviewer.
For RCTs, the quality of selected articles was
assessed according to the NICE single technology
appraisal manufacturer's template22 and the
Jadad scoring system.23 The quality of selected
non-RCTs and observational studies was assessed
using the Downs and Black instrument.24
Abstracts from conference proceedings were
assessed using a modified version of the Downs
and Black instrument. Studies scoring poorly on
any of the quality assessments were excluded
from the main analyses.
Results
Literature search
A total of 22,334 abstracts were identified and
screened for eligibility; 938 articles were retrieved
for full-text review, and 114 studies reported in
122 publications were finally assessed (Figure 1
and Supplementary Table 4).
Based on the full-text review of selected articles,
five studies were excluded due to low-quality
assessment scores. Details of these studies, and
the reasons for their exclusion, are provided in
Supplementary Table 5.
Over 90% of studies included in the review
involved administration of ADM or IFX. Only a
few studies were available for other agents; four,
two, one and four studies were identified con-
cerning CZP, GLM, UST and VDM treatment
in IBD, respectively.
Rates of immunogenicity in patients receiving
treatment with biologics
Rates of ADAb formation were extremely varia-
ble (Table 1). A brief summary of factors affect-
ing the formation and detection of ADAbs is
provided in Supplementary Table 6. A total of 12
RCTs and 62 non-RCTs or observational studies
of IFX were reviewed, and rates of over 60% were
observed in six of these studies. The highest rates
of ADAb formation were associated with IFX in
patients with CD or UC (Table 1). The highest
rate for any other agent was 38% for ADM in one
retrospective cohort study (Table 1).
Rates of immunogenicity in patients receiving
treatment with infliximab
In total, 82 publications were identified, repre-
senting 78 studies on the immunogenicity of IFX;
the majority of these (87.2%) were observational
studies. Of the 78 studies reviewed, 74 reported
the percentage of patients developing ADAbs to
IFX. One of these studies25 was excluded from
the analysis, as it reported a very high rate of
immunogenicity (79%) based on a small sample
size (n = 28). The percentage of patients with
ADAbs to IFX varied widely, from 0% to 65.3%
(Table 1 and Figure 2(a)).
Rates of immunogenicity in patients receiving
treatment with adalimumab
A total of 25 publications were identified, repre-
senting 23 studies. As was the case with IFX, the
majority of these (43.5%) were prospective obser-
vational studies. All but one of the studies
reported the percentage of patients with CD or
UC who developed ADAbs to ADM, which var-
ied from 0.3% to 38% (Table 1 and Figure 2(b)).
Rates of immunogenicity in patients receiving
treatment with certolizumab pegol, golimumab,
ustekinumab and vedolizumab
CZP is approved for use in CD and not UC;
therefore, in line with the approved indication,
only studies reporting immunogenicity to CZP in
CD were identified. These studies reported the
percentage of patients developing ADAbs to CZP
as ranging from 3.3% to 25.3% (Table 1). VDM
is approved in both CD and UC, and identified
studies reported immunogenicity developing in
between 1% and 4.1% of patients (Table 1).
GLM is not approved for use in CD. Two RCTs
of GLM use in UC were identified, reporting that
ADAbs were detected in 0.4% and 2.9% of
patients (Table 1). In the single identified study
of UST immunogenicity, 0.7% of patients in an
RCT of UST in CD developed ADAbs (Table 1).
Impact of ADAb formation on treatment efficacy
In most of the included studies that evaluated
efficacy, the presence of ADAbs was associated
with a reduction in efficacy. Efficacy was assessed
in a variety of ways, including Crohn's Disease
Activity Index (CDAI) response/remission, Mayo
response, endoscopic improvement and treat-
ment discontinuation. In studies of IFX, the
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11

proportion of patients achieving and maintaining
a response was generally lower for patients with
detected ADAbs than those without detected
ADAbs (Supplementary Table 7). ADAbs to
ADM were also associated with reduced efficacy
and a loss of response, together with a high rate
of secondary treatment failure; these associ-
ations were shown to be statistically significant in

some studies (Supplementary Table 8). In one
study,26 discontinuation of ADM treatment was
reported to be very high (83.3%) in patients with
ADAbs (Supplementary Table 8).
Impact of ADAb formation on treatment safety
In studies of IFX, AEs were more common in
patients with ADAbs than in those without
ADAbs. AEs observed included a higher propor-
tion reporting infusion-related reactions. The
studies for ADM, CZP, GLM, VDM or UST
reported either no safety data segmented by
ADAbs status or no increased safety concerns
associated with the development of ADAbs.
Impact of ADAb formation on treatment
pharmacokinetics
For studies included in this review in which serum
levels of biologics were reported ­ ADM, CZP
and IFX ­ ADAbs-positive patients had lower
serum levels of the biologic than ADAbs-negative
patients (Table 2).27­48
Time course of immunogenicity
Minimal information was available regarding
the earliest time at which immunogenicity was
detected. Furthermore, the timing of dosing
and subsequent testing for ADAbs varied
between studies. The majority of studies
reported ADAbs testing in serum taken prior to
the next infusion (trough). ADAbs can occur as
early as 10­14 days post-dosing, and this find-
ing has been reported in some studies. However,
ADAbs can also take months to reach detectable
levels (Table 3).26,37,38,41,47,49­61
Pharmacoeconomics
We identified only one study that addressed phar-
macoeconomic issues related to the development
of immunogenicity to biologic therapy in IBD; this
Danish study involved 69 patients with CD with
secondary IFX failure receiving either IFX dose
intensification (5 mg/kg every 4 weeks) or inter-
ventions based on serum IFX and IFX antibody
levels.62 The authors concluded that monitoring of
ADAbs to IFX in patients with CD was more cost-
effective than dose escalation without drug moni-
toring and immunogenicity assessment.
Discussion
Development of immunogenicity occurs with all
six of the biologic agents investigated in patients
with IBD. Huge variability in the rate of immuno-
genicity was observed, depending on the timing
of sampling, the assay technique (drug sensitive
versus drug tolerant), the study population (agent-
naïve or experienced and concomitant medica-
tionstaken),thesetting(RCTsversusobservational
study), and the criteria for a positive finding (a
single sample or multiple samples above the
defined threshold). Care must therefore be taken
in the interpretation and comparison of these
findings.
The timing of sampling (prior to or just after the
next administration) greatly influences the detec-
tion rate. Most assays do not detect ADAbs in the
Table 1. Range of rates (%) of ADAbs formation to biologics in patients with IBDa,b.

presence of drug; since drug concentration is the
lowest just before the next infusion, this is the
optimal time to sample. This might be one expla-
nation for the formation of ADAbs being reported
to be lower in RCTs than in observational studies.
Often, a limited number of time points were stud-
ied, and insufficient time was allowed for drug lev-
els to decrease prior to sampling. However, it is
also likely that improved assay techniques used in
observational studies, together with the selection
of patients with loss of response, led to higher lev-
els of detection of ADAbs than in RCTs.
The immunogenicity reported for biologic agents
used in IBD may adversely impact pharmacoki-
netics, efficacy and safety. Development of
ADAbs to biologic therapy may therefore have a
substantial impact on patients with IBD, as the

consequent loss of efficacy and the increased
potential for AEs is likely to result in a worsening
of their condition, and a switch in their treatment
may be required.6 Despite the range of treatments
available for both CD and UC, the development
of ADAbs to biologics, and the resultant impact,
means that there is still an unmet treatment
need in these diseases. Both European and US
treatment guidelines require investigation of the
immunogenic potential of biologic therapies when

post-marketing monitoring of the development of
immunogenicity.63,64
ADAbs produced in response to TNF inhibitors
(TNFi) may be neutralizing or non-neutralizing,
depending on the binding site. Neutralizing
ADAbs produced in response to TNFi bind to
the epitope binding (Fab)2
region of the TNFi,
thereby reducing the agents' therapeutic activ-
ity.65 By contrast, non-neutralizing antibodies do
not prevent binding of the agents to target mole-
cules, and hence do not reduce the efficacy of bio-
logic agents; they do, however, impact the
pharmacokinetics, by accelerating clearance of
the agent.66 It is also known that some ADAbs are
transient in nature. These may appear at any time
during treatment and seem to be of little clinical
significance compared to persistent ADAbs.47,53,54
Giving biologic therapies in combination with
concomitant immunosuppressive agents has been
shown in several studies to reduce the development
of ADAbs.67,68 One meta-analysis demonstrated
that the use of concomitant immunosuppressants,
primarily MTX, reduced the proportion of
patients on IFX and ADM with detectable ADAbs
by about 41% in those with rheumatoid arthritis,
spondyloarthritis, psoriasis and IBD.67 However,
the mechanism for this attenuation is not fully
understood.68 Therefore, reducing the likelihood
of a patient developing an immunogenic response
to a biologic therapy may influence decisions
made by the clinician in regard to the treatment
prescribed for patients with IBD. There is evi-
dence that scheduled treatment with IFX not only
results in improved efficacy69 compared with epi-
sodic treatment, but that this is associated with a
reduced level of immunogenicity.70 Clinicians
should also consider administering a loading dose
of a biologic at the commencement of therapy,
because, in addition to achieving therapeutic levels
rapidly, this has been reported to reduce immuno-
genicity,71 as has intravenous hydrocortisone treat-
ment immediately prior to infusion with IFX.72
Potential limitations of the present study include
the diversity of study design, patient populations,
disease severity, concomitant therapies, assay
methods and timing of the studies reviewed. This
lack of standardization limited comparison across
studies and between therapies. In addition, limited
information was available for a number of the bio-
logic agents included in the systematic literature
search, with over 90% of studies reporting on IFX
and ADM, reflecting the time these agents have
been on the market compared to the other agents
investigated. Not all studies reported data for some
of the immunogenicity-related outcomes related to
efficacy and safety, limiting conclusions on the
impact of the development of ADAbs. It is also
possible that rates of immunogenicity, as well as
safety and efficacy outcomes, may have been under-
estimated in a number of the studies included in
the review, due to insufficient sensitivity of the
assay techniques used, small sample sizes, and lim-
ited follow-up of sampling (after wash-out of the
biologic agent).
The potential clinical implication of lower biologic
serum concentrations, reduced efficacy, and
increased safety issues in the presence of immuno-
genicity is a concern for effective treatment and
requires further study. In particular, more studies
are required to assess the immunogenic potential
of the more recently approved biologics. However,
this analysis suggests that agents that elicit the
lowest rate of immunogenicity may be preferential
for treating CD and UC. Immunogenicity is one
of the major causes for loss of response to biologic
therapy,13 but immunogenicity must be assessed
and interpreted in an appropriate manner. It is
essential that research to improve understanding
of immunogenicity and identify agents with lim-
ited immunogenic potential continues, in order to
provide safe and effective treatment options.
