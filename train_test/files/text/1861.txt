The relation between height and lower extremity peripheral insensate neuropathy among persons with and
without diabetes was examined by use of the 1999­2002 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
with 5,229 subjects aged 40 or more years. A monofilament was used to determine whether any of three areas on
each foot were insensate. Peripheral insensate neuropathy was defined as the presence of one or more insensate
areas. Its prevalence was nearly twice as high among persons with diabetes (21.2%) as among those without
diabetes (11.5%; p < 0.001). Men (16.2%) had 1.7 times the prevalence of peripheral insensate neuropathy as did
women (9.4%), but the difference was not significant after adjustment for height. Greater height was associated
with increased peripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence among persons with and without diabetes (p < 0.001).
This association was characterized by a sharp increase in prevalence among persons who were taller than
175.5 cm. Peripheral insensate neuropathy risk was significantly higher among those taller than 175.5 cm (adjusted
odds ratio ¼ 2.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.5, 3.5). The authors conclude that body height is an important correlate
of peripheral insensate neuropathy. This association largely accounts for the difference in peripheral insensate
neuropathy prevalence between men and women. Height may help health-care providers to identify persons at high
risk of peripheral insensate neuropathy.

Peripheral insensate neuropathy is common in the middle-
aged or older adult US population (1). It is one of the
most disabling complications of diabetes because of its high
incidence and its potential to lead to lower extremity ul-
ceration, deformation, and amputation (2). Early identifi-
cation of neuropathy, tight glycemic control among people
with diabetes, smoking cessation, and other preventive care
are considered key public-health strategies against costly
foot complications (3­6). Factors associated with neuropa-
thy include diabetes mellitus, poor glycemic control, male
sex, White race, and older age (1, 7, 8).
There is also growing, yet still unappreciated evidence that
height may be an important and practical predictor of periph-
eralinsensate neuropathy or lower extremityamputation (7­9).
Height may increase the risk of peripheral insensate neurop-
athy because of increased axon surface exposure to toxins.
Most studies that have noted a relation of height with periph-
eral neuropathy or amputation were conducted among persons
with diabetes mellitus (7, 10­15), and few population-based
studies have been conducted (13). It is unknown whether
there is a threshold in the association between height and risk
for peripheral insensate neuropathy in the general population.

As the first nationally representative epidemiologic sur-
vey to include an assessment of peripheral insensate neu-
ropathy based on monofilament testing, the 1999­2002
US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) allowed us to explore the relation between body
height and peripheral insensate neuropathy among persons
with and without diabetes mellitus, while accounting for
various confounders or effect modifiers. In particular, it
allowed us to examine whether there are threshold effects
in the association between height and peripheral insensate
neuropathy and whether any association is modified by
the effects of factors such as diabetes status, sex, and race/
ethnicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The NHANES is a nationally representative survey of the
US civilian noninstitutionalized population conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (16). Since 1999, NHANES
staff have conducted interviews and performed physical
examinations on a continuous basis. Participants are inter-
viewed in their homes about their health history, health
behaviors, and risk factors and subsequently undergo the
physical examination at a mobile examination center. The
procedures to select the sample and conduct the interview
and examination have been described elsewhere (16). In-
formed consent is obtained from all participants, and the
protocol has been approved by the institutional review board
of the National Center for Health Statistics.
This report is based on 4 years of NHANES data (from
1999 to 2002). Of 6,668 persons aged 40 or more years who
answered the diabetes questionnaire during this time, 5,848
(87.8 percent) also underwent the health examination, which
included anthropometry. Of this sample, 619 (10.6 percent)
did not undergo the peripheral insensate neuropathy ex-
amination because they refused or had a physical/health
limitation, because of technical problems and errors in mea-
surement, or because of some other unspecified reason; 86
more were excluded from our analysis because they had no
height measurement. Thus, peripheral insensate neuropathy
examination results and height were available for 5,229 sub-
jects aged 40 or more years.
Assessment of peripheral insensate neuropathy
Peripheral insensate neuropathy was assessed by testing
subjects' foot sensation with a standardized 5.07-gauge
(10-g force) Semmes-Weinstein nylon monofilament ac-
cording to a standard protocol (1). Health technicians ap-
plied pressure with the monofilament at three sites on the
bottom of each of the subjects' feet (plantar, first metatarsal
head; plantar, fifth metatarsal head; and plantar, hallux) (i.e,
a total of six sites). They applied the monofilament until it
buckled and then held it for another second. A site was con-
sidered insensate if there were 1) two incorrect responses,
2) two ``unable to determine'' responses, or 3) one incorrect
and one ``unable to determine'' response for a site. The sites
are tested in a nonsequential order to allow for better dis-
crimination of sensation by the examinee. Impaired sensa-
tion was quantified by the total number of insensate areas
for both feet (range: 0­6), and peripheral insensate neurop-
athy was defined as one or more insensate area. Previous
studies have found the presence of one or more insensate
areas to be highly predictive of ulcers and amputation and
to have moderately high sensitivity (~85 percent) and spec-
ificity (~80 percent) based on vibration testing and ulcer
history (17­20).
Diabetes and other measurements
Participants' responses to the questionnaires were used to
categorize them by their self-reported physician-diagnosed
diabetes status, duration of history of diabetes (no diabetes;
diabetes <7 years; diabetes 7 years), measured high blood
pressure (yes, no), and age (years), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic White vs. others), education (less than high school
vs. high school education or more), current smoking status
(yes, no), and current alcohol consumption status (none;
mild: <1 drink/week; moderate: 1­7 drinks/week; and heavy:
8 drinks/week).
Participants' height (cm) and weight (kg) were measured
with a standard protocol, and they were divided into four
quartile groups by height (<161, 161­167.9, 168­175.9,
and 176 cm) and by weight (<67, 67­78.9, 79­91.9,
and 92 kg). Their body mass index was calculated as
weight (kg)/height (m)2, and they were divided into three
groups on the basis of their body mass index: normal (<25),
overweight (25­29.9), and obese (30).
The glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) percentage was used
to measure participants' glycemic control. They were di-
vided into two sets of four quartiles on the basis of their
A1c percentage levels: 6.1, 6.2­7.1, 7.2­8.3, and 8.4
percent for those with diabetes and <5.1, 5.1­5.2, 5.3­5.4,
and 5.5 percent for those without diabetes. Detailed de-
scriptions about blood collection and processing are pro-
vided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists
Procedures Manual (21).
The self-reported average level of physical activity, in-
cluding work, housework if a homemaker, and going to and
attending classes if a student, each day had been divided into
three levels: mainly sit, walk a lot, and carry loads or climb
often.
Participants' blood pressure was measured according to
standard protocol involving three and sometimes four sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements taken with
a mercury sphygmomanometer in the mobile examination
center on all eligible individuals (21). We defined high blood
pressure as an average systolic blood pressure of 140 or
more mmHg or an average diastolic blood pressure of 90
or more mmHg.
Statistical analyses
In our primary analyses, we estimated the prevalence
of peripheral insensate neuropathy in the overall nonin-
stitutionalized US population aged 40 or more years and
within several subgroups. We used SAS, version 9.1, soft-
ware (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) for data

with SUDAAN, version 9.0.1, software (SUDAAN Sta-
tistical Software Center, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina) to take into account the complex sampling design
and to obtain representative estimates. For each of the pri-
mary outcomes, we used the largest sample size available to
estimate prevalence. We computed 95 percent confidence
intervals using the critical value for a t distribution with

the appropriate number of degrees of freedom for each
subgroup, and we used logistic regression to calculate age-
and race-adjusted and other multivariate-adjusted preva-
lence estimators (predictive marginals), as well as the odds
ratio with 95 percent confidence interval. We applied a
joinpoint regression model and used the permutation test
to determine whether there was a change of linear trend for
age- and race-adjusted prevalences of peripheral insensate
neuropathy by height (22). The joinpoint and 95 percent
confidence interval were calculated by Joinpoint, version
3.0, freeware (23). We also assessed the significance of in-
teraction terms between height and other variables and tested
statistical hypotheses at the 0.05 level.
RESULTS
Persons with diabetes are older than persons without di-
abetes (p < 0.001). The means of height and weight were
167.0 cm (standard error (SE): 0.6) and 87.8 kg (SE: 1.3) for
persons with diabetes and 168.5 cm (SE: 1.3) and 79.9 kg
(SE: 0.5) for persons without diabetes. Table 1 shows char-
acteristics of the sample by diabetes status weighted to the
US population. Among the 5,229 persons representing a US
population of 107 million (90.5 percent) noninstitutional-
ized civilians aged 40 or more years, 12.5 percent had pe-
ripheral insensate neuropathy (15.5 percent among men and
9.9 percent among women; p < 0.001). The age- and race-
adjusted prevalence of peripheral insensate neuropathy was
21.2 percent among persons with diabetes and 11.5 percent
among persons without diabetes (p < 0.001). Compared
with persons without diabetes, those with diabetes were,
on average, shorter, heavier, and less likely to be non-
Hispanic White, not to have finished high school, or to
smoke or drink. Persons with diabetes also had a higher
prevalence of high blood pressure than did persons without
diabetes. The mean duration of diabetes among persons with
diabetes was 11.8 years; the median duration was 7 years
with an interquartile range of 2­15 years.
Peripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence increased
with age and was higher among men than women in all
age groups. The prevalence of peripheral insensate neurop-
athy among persons aged 40­44 years was 7.9 percent for
men and 3.0 percent for women, and it increased linearly to
22.2 percent and 12.6 percent among those aged 65­69
years, reaching 45.5 percent and 32.9 percent, respectively,
among those aged 85 or more years.
The mean height was 176 cm among men and 161 cm
among women. The median and interquartile range of body
height for men and women were 176 (171­181) and 162
(157­166) cm, respectively; 78 percent of men had height
greater than 170 cm, while only 10 percent of women had
height greater than 170 cm. For our analyses of both sexes
together, we chose the second quartile of body height as the
referent quartile, because it provided the greatest amount of
overlap of the height distributions among men and women.
As shown in figure 1, the age- and race-adjusted preva-
lence of peripheral insensate neuropathy was fairly constant
among men 175.5 cm (5 feet, 9 inches) or shorter and among
women 171.5 cm (5 feet, 8 inches) or shorter but increased
sharply with height. The joinpoint regression detected a
linear threshold for men of 175.5 cm (95 percent confi-
dence interval (CI): 161.5, 181.5); however, it did not find
any statistically significant threshold for women, probably

because there were not enough women 170 cm tall or taller
in the study sample. The threshold of peripheral insensate
neuropathy prevalence by height for the entire study popu-
lation was also 175.5 cm (95 percent CI: 163, 177), similar to
that for men. The age- and race-adjusted prevalence of pe-
ripheral insensate neuropathy was 11.4 percent among men
175.5 cm or shorter and 20.5 percent among men 176 cm or
taller (p < 0.001), while the adjusted prevalence of periph-
eral insensate neuropathy among women was 9.8 percent
among those 171.5 cm or shorter and 11.9 percent among
those taller than 171.5 cm (p ¼ 0.500 for only 136 women).
As shown in table 2, we found similar associations be-
tween height and peripheral insensate neuropathy across
strata of diabetes status. Those 176 cm or taller had almost
twice the age- and race-adjusted peripheral insensate neu-
ropathy prevalence (19.1 percent) as those between 161 and
168 cm in height (10.3 percent). Among persons with di-
abetes, duration of diabetes was a strong predictor of pe-
ripheral insensate neuropathy risk, while among persons
without diabetes, heavy weight, non-White race, and not
having finished high school were each associated with higher
risk for peripheral insensate neuropathy. In a separated mul-
tivariate logistic model without height and weight, the odds
ratios of peripheral insensate neuropathy among persons
with diabetes were 1.0 (referent), 1.2 (95 percent CI: 0.6,
2.3), and 1.5 (95 percent CI: 0.8, 2.9) for normal, over-
weight, and obese persons, respectively, while the odds
ratios of peripheral insensate neuropathy among persons
without diabetes were 1.0 (referent), 1.4 (95 percent CI:
1.1, 1.9), and 1.8 (95 percent CI: 1.3, 1.5) by the same three
body mass index groups.
Adjusted total prevalences by height or adjusted preva-
lences by height and diabetes status adjusted for height,
weight, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, alcohol
consumption, average level of physical activity each day,
diabetes and duration of diabetes, and blood pressure status
are displayed in figure 2. For the entire population, peripheral
insensate neuropathy risk was significantly higher among
persons 176 cm or taller (odds ratio ¼ 2.3, 95 percent CI:
1.5, 3.5) than among persons 161­167.9 cm. Adjusted pe-
ripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence rates were higher
among persons with diabetes than among those without
diabetes (odds ratio ¼ 1.8, 95 percent CI: 1.3, 2.5) from
another multivariate logistic model. Among persons with
diabetes, the likelihood of peripheral insensate neuropathy
was increased among persons who were either taller than
175.5 cm or had been diagnosed with diabetes for at least
7 years.
We found no statistically significant interactions between
subjects' height and any of the other potential risk factors
we examined, including weight, age, sex, race/ethnicity, ed-
ucational level, smoking status, alcohol consumption status,
A1c percentage, and diabetes status and duration. In addi-
tion, among persons with diabetes, p values of the interac-
tion terms of height and diabetes duration, as well as height
and A1c percentage, were 0.428 and 0.450, respectively.

When we compared the characteristics of potential study
subjects who were excluded from analysis because of miss-
ing peripheral insensate neuropathy or height data with
those of the study subjects with peripheral insensate neu-
ropathy and height data, we found that those who were
excluded were, on average, older (60 vs. 57 years), had
a higher prevalence of diabetes (14.5 percent vs. 9.4 per-
cent), had a higher mean A1c level (5.8 vs. 5.6 percent), and
were less likely to be male (41.3 percent vs. 47.4 percent) or
non-Hispanic White (63.8 percent vs. 78.0 percent).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative study, we confirmed ear-
lier findings that peripheral insensate neuropathy is common
and that it is associated with diabetes, age, and male sex. We
also found that being tall was a similarly important risk
factor and that this association between height and periph-
eral insensate neuropathy prevalence probably explains the
difference in prevalence between men and women. Our
analysis of both sexes together found that the age- and
race-adjusted peripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence
among persons in the highest quartile of height was 2.3
times higher than that among those in the second quartile
(the quartile of height distribution that included adequate
numbers of both men and women). Of note, this association
was stronger than the association between A1c percent-
age levels and peripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence
among persons with diabetes. Our findings suggest that
height, particularly when considered in combination with
current recommendations for screening among persons
with diabetes, may help to identify persons at relatively
high risk for peripheral insensate neuropathy. We estimated
that 65.6 percent of noninstitutionalized US adults aged
40 or more years (about 6.6 million people) were at high
risk for peripheral insensate neuropathy because they were
taller than 175.5 cm or had diagnosed diabetes for more
than 7 years. These findings may be useful in the develop-
ment of risk-stratification algorithms to focus peripheral
insensate neuropathy screening on persons at high risk for
the condition.
The pathogenesis of the relation between height and the
prevalence of peripheral insensate neuropathy remains un-
clear. It seems unlikely that increased stature has a general-
ized adverse effect on peripheral nerve function since
sensorineural hearing loss, another form of peripheral defi-
cit, by contrast, is associated with reduced stature (24). In-
stead, the association of height with peripheral insensate
neuropathy may be specific to long nerves of the body. In-
creased nerve length is associated with greater axon surface
area, and any localized injury to an axon may impair the
overall conduction properties of the nerve. Therefore, per-
sons with longer nerves (and thus a larger total axon surface
area) may be at greater risk for neurologic impairment when
exposed to otherwise equivalent hazards (e.g., constant con-
centration of advanced glycation end products). Greater leg
length might also be associated with a prolonged time re-
quirement for the complete regeneration of any injured
nerve (25); this would tend to increase the duration of pe-
ripheral insensate neuropathy, thus increasing the preva-
lence of peripheral insensate neuropathy in the population.
Alternatively, the association of height with peripheral in-
sensate neuropathy might be related to the increased hydro-
static pressure experienced in the feet of tall persons when
they stand up. Peripheral insensate neuropathy would occur
more often if aging or prolonged diabetes is linked to a
loss of compensatory responses to large pressure changes
in small blood vessels. Yet another alternative explanation
could be related to greater skin thickness or other protective
characteristics on the soles of tall people. This would be
consistent with our finding that peripheral insensate neu-
ropathy prevalence is related to weight among nondiabetic
persons even after adjustment for height and other covari-
ates (table 2).
In addition, Harris et al. (26) showed that height was not
associated with extremity symptomatic neuropathy. Sorensen
et al. (7) demonstrated that only 11.7 percent of persons
with lower extremity insensate neuropathy defined by vi-
bration perception threshold had lower foot painful neurop-
athy. In this latter study, height was related to insensate
neuropathy but not related to painful neuropathy. These data
suggest that sensate neuropathy may be different from in-
sensate neuropathy and perhaps less associated with struc-
tural nerve damage.
There were limitations to our study. First, because
NHANES does not collect information from people in nurs-
ing homes or other similar institutions, our subjects were not
representative of the entire older US population. Second,
``duration of diabetes'' as measured in this study did not
reflect the true duration of the disease but the time since
diagnosis, and actual diabetes onset might precede its di-
agnosis by several years (27). Third, there were not enough
women taller than 170 cm to reliably determine the periph-
eral insensate neuropathy prevalence among them. Fourth,
because this was a cross-sectional study, we could not de-
termine whether the association between modifiable risk
factors and the risk of peripheral insensate neuropathy was
a cause-effect association. This may explain why we did not
find smoking to be associated with an increased risk of
peripheral insensate neuropathy as the authors of a previous
study did (8). Fifth, although persons with significant cal-
luses had been excluded from the study, NHANES did not
have detailed information about calluses. Finally, we used
monofilament testing to determine the peripheral insensate
neuropathy status of study subjects when electrophysio-
logic, nerve conduction, or skin biopsy studies could have
produced more accurate diagnostic data; however, in epide-
miologic studies, monofilament testing is still an improve-
ment over the use of symptom questionnaires in terms of
sensitivity, specificity, and capacity to predict adverse out-
comes (17­19, 28).
In conclusion, we found that body height is a risk factor
of peripheral insensate neuropathy, that the difference in
height between men and women may explain much of the
difference in peripheral insensate neuropathy prevalence
between them, and that peripheral insensate neuropathy
prevalence increases sharply with height at a height thresh-
old of around 175.5 cm. Height may help health-care provid-
ers identify persons who require more intensive neuropathic
