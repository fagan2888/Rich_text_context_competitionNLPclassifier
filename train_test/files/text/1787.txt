Investigations into human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) have, for the most part, assessed intake based on food consumption estimates combined with
measurements or estimates of BPA in foods. In this study, nationally representative data on urinary levels of BPA in the United States (US) from the
2003­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to estimate daily intake of BPA, assuming steady-state excretion.
Distributions of intakes for the US population were determined for (i) all NHANES participants with urinary BPA data; (ii) participants by the following
age groups: 6­11 years, 12­19 years, 20­39 years, 40­59 years, and 60 þ years; and (iii) participants by gender. On the basis of the NHANES urinary
BPA data and the assumptions described in this paper, daily BPA intakes for male participants are statistically significantly higher than for female
participants, and there are statistically significant differences in daily BPA intakes according to age groups, with the oldest group having the lowest
estimated intakes. Median intake was approximately three orders of magnitude below health-based guidance values of 50 mg/kg-day.

Introduction
Bisphenol A (BPA, CAS no. 80-05-7) or 2,2-bis(4-hydro-
xyphenyl)propane, a chemical primarily used to manufacture
polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins and present at a
residual level in items such as baby bottles and coatings in
food cans (Tsai, 2006), has received a considerable amount of
international media attention (Maclean's, 2007; PBS, 2007;
Rocky Mountain News, 2007; Sunday Star Times, 2007;
USA Today, 2007), especially following the release of two
expert panel reports that reached different conclusions
regarding the level of concern associated with human
exposure to BPA (CERHR, 2007; vom Saal et al., 2007).
Although media attention has focused primarily on the
scientific issues surrounding the toxicity of BPA, less
information has been highlighted regarding estimates of
human exposure to BPA. An understanding of human
exposure is critical for meaningful risk assessment. The
investigations into human exposure have, for the most part,
assessed intake based on food consumption estimates
combined with measurements or estimates of BPA in foods
and in the environment (Kang et al., 2006; Wilson et al.,
2007), rather than directly measuring human exposure.
Recently, data on urinary levels of BPA in the United States
(US) from the 2003­2004 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) have been made available
(CDC, 2007; Calafat et al., 2008), providing nationally
representative data for male and female subjects from ages 6
to 60 þ years. These data can be used to estimate daily intake
of BPA, assuming steady-state excretion (Calafat et al., 2008).
In this paper, we describe the results of analyses of the
NHANES urinary BPA data giving estimates of daily intake
of BPA in the US population, for male and female subjects,
and by age group. We first briefly discuss summary
information on the 2003­2004 NHANES urinary BPA
database (for a more complete description, see Calafat et al.,
2008). We then present the method used to estimate daily
BPA intakes, and give information on the assumptions and
parameters used as the foundation for the intake derivations.
Finally, we compare these results to previously published
daily intakes from estimates of food consumption and food
BPA concentrations and to health-based guidance values.

who participated in the NHANES survey during 2003 and
2004). Total BPA, after hydrolysis of conjugated metabolites,
was measured in urine for NHANES 2003­2004 (analyte
designated as URXBPH in the database with units of ng/ml).
The method limit of detection (LOD) is given as 0.36 ng/ml
(CDC, 2005). In the data analyses, measures below the
detection limit were assigned a value of the LOD divided by
the square root of 2 (CDC, 2006).
The total number of participants reported in the 2003­
2004 Laboratory 24 subsample is 2612; however, 95 of those
individuals had no data reported for BPA. Thus, the
subsample for which there are existing BPA data includes
2517 individuals. Of that subsample, 164 of the measure-
ments were below the LOD.
Urinary BPA percentiles and geometric means for all
participants, and by age and gender, were given by Calafat
et al. (2008). Our separate analysis of the data, which
provides additional age categories used in the assessment of
daily intake, is shown in Table 1 (the results are within
0.2 ng/ml of those given by Calafat et al.). In both analyses,
weighting factors provided by CDC are applied to the
raw data, resulting in estimates of percentiles and mean
values that are meant to be representative of the US
population.
Method for Estimating BPA Daily Intake
The following steps were used to estimate daily intake for
individuals with urinary BPA data from the 2003­2004
NHANES database. For each individual in the NHANES
database with urinary BPA data, the urinary BPA concen-
tration (ng/ml) was combined with 24-h urinary output
volume (ml) to determine daily excretion of BPA in units of
nanogram/day (ng/day). This was assumed to be equivalent
to the daily intake. To obtain the daily intake adjusted for
body weight (expressed in units of ng/kg-day), the daily
intake for each individual was divided by that individual's
body weight, as reported in the NHANES database (Eq. 1).
To estimate various population (and population subgroups)
quantities such as intake means or intake percentiles,
weighted means and percentiles were calculated using
the NHANES 2-year weights provided for the Laboratory
24 sample (as described in the NHANES analytic
guidelines; CDC, 2004).
Urinary BPA ðng=mlÞÂurinary output ðml=dayÞ=
body weight ðkgÞ ¼ ng BPA=kg-day
ð1Þ
Using this approach, distributions of intakes representative
of the US population were determined for (i) all participants;
(ii) participants by the following age groups: 6­11 years,
12­19 years, 20­39 years, 40­59 years, and 60 þ years; and
(iii) participants by gender. The calculations of point
estimates and confidence intervals for the geometric mean
intakes and intake percentiles were carried out in the R
platform (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996), using the survey
package written by Thomas Lumley (http://faculty.washington.
edu/tlumley/survey/).
Because the NHANES data give information on urinary
concentrations, rather than intake, certain assumptions and
databases were relied upon. The following sections describe
the underlying data supporting each assumption and
database used in this analysis.
Use of Urinary BPA to Represent Daily Intake Excretion
of ingested BPA into urine is essentially complete in 24 h
(Vo
¨ lkel et al., 2002, 2005; Tsukioka et al., 2004), mostly as
the glucuronide conjugate, so total BPA after hydrolysis of
conjugates (referred to from this point onward as urinary
BPA) in a 24-h urine sample approximates the BPA intake
from the previous 24 h (Arakawa et al., 2004; Tsukioka et al.,
2004). Thus, urinary BPA measures are useful for
representing total excreted BPA and provide a reasonable
surrogate for intake (Dekant and Vo
¨ lkel, 2008).
Urine Volume- or Creatinine-Based BPA Data CDC
provides urinary BPA data both in units of ng/ml urine and
ng/g creatinine. To derive intake estimates, we are seeking
total daily excreted BPA in units of mass, and so would need
to adjust the NHANES data by either daily urinary output
(volume) or daily creatinine excretion (mass), and
assumptions about those two output values would be
needed. Many factors contribute to the daily variability in
creatinine output, including diurnal variation (possibly

attributed to changes in the rate of glomerular filtration),
body mass, age, gender, health status, and external factors
such as diet, exercise, and drug use. The range of creatinine
concentration in urine may be over 1000% (this can be
compared with the variation in daily personal urinary volume
of up to 300%; Boeniger et al., 1993). Further, BPA is
glucuronidated in the liver and then eliminated by active
tubular secretion, calling into question the appropriateness of
adjusting urinary BPA concentrations by creatinine
(Mahalingaiah et al., 2008). BPA measures reported in
units of ng/ml were selected for this analysis.
Daily Urinary Output Data Given the lack of 24-h urinary
output data for the NHANES participants, it is necessary to
use generic values to describe typical urinary output based on
age and gender to estimate total daily excretion of BPA in
nanograms. Values for daily urinary excretion used in this
analysis (Table 2) were derived from the reference values given
by the International Commission on Radiological Protection
(Valentin, 2002; ICRP, 2003). For individuals from 20þ
years, the ICRP values used were those for the ``adult.'' For
ages 12­19 years, the ICRP values for 15-year olds were used.
For ages 6­11 years, the average of the ICRP values for the
5-year olds (500 ml/day) and 10-year olds (700 ml/day) was
used. The only gender difference in ICRP values was for
adults, with a lower value assigned to female participants
(1200 ml/day) than that for male participants (1600 ml/day).
The ICRP values were based on several studies in the
published literature. To evaluate whether the ICRP values
correspond to additional data in the literature, a PubMed
search was conducted seeking information on the relationship
between urinary output in healthy individuals, and age and
gender. The literature search terms included ``daily,''
``urinary,'' ``output,'' ``24-h,'' and ``volume.'' Literature
from 1951 to present was identified using this search
procedure. The value of 600 ml/day for young children
appears to be relatively consistent with additional informa-
tion obtained from the literature. For example, a study on
urinary fluoride excretion in 33 British 6-year-old children
reported mean urinary outputs of 459­534 ml (Zohouri
et al., 2005). Children (N ¼ 74) in Ghana aged 5­12 years
(mean ¼ 9 years) had mean daily urinary excretion volumes
of 1136.8 ml (range: 400­2400 ml; Badoe et al., 2005).
Children (aged 4 years) from Sri Lanka (N ¼ 53) and
England (N ¼ 44) had mean 24-h urine volumes of 504 ml
and 449 ml, respectively (Rugg-Gunn et al., 1993).
For healthy adults, an Internet search revealed general
statements on urinary output (for example, B800­2000 ml/
24 h, assuming ``normal'' fluid intake; MedlinePlus Medical
Encyclopedia, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/ar-
ticle/003425.htm; age range not given). The ICRP values for
adults of 1200 ml/day (female) and 1600 ml/day (male) are
generally consistent with this information. However, other
information obtained from the published literature suggests
that the value of 1200 ml/day for female adults may be an
underestimate. For example, mean (10th to 90th percentile
range) 24-h urinary output values for 330 white US women
and 146 black US women were given as 2030 ml (1140­
2960 ml) and 1790 ml (910­2800 ml) (Taylor and Curhan,
2007). In addition, Mueller et al. (2005) reported median
(25th to 75th quartile range) 24-h urinary output values for
141 women of 1515 ml (1110­2130 ml). Taylor and Curhan
(2006) provided additional data on 24-h urine excretion
volumes for non-stone-forming women, with values ranging
from 1970 to 2110 ml/day for older women, and 1700­
2080 ml/day for younger women.
The ICRP-based values as given in Table 2 are used in this
analysis. As daily intake is proportional to urinary output
(Eq. 1), use of alternative values for urinary output would
result in proportional changes to estimates of daily intake.
Body Weight Data To provide estimates of daily intake
adjusted for body weight, we used body weight data from the
2003­2004 NHANES database for those participants with
reported urinary BPA data. However, 124 individuals from
Laboratory 24 were missing either BPA or body weight data;
the total count of participants with all necessary data for
estimating daily BPA intake is 2488. Mean body weights by
age group and gender are given in Table 2.
It is instructive to compare the body weights reported
by NHANES with generic values provided by the US
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Exposure

Factors Handbook (EPA, 1997), as this is a standard
reference used for obtaining exposure parameter information
for the US population. Mean body weights by age group and
gender for NHANES participants with BPA data and mean
body weights given by EPA (1997) are compared in Table 2.
The values from the NHANES data are somewhat larger
than the body weights given by EPA. Because daily intake is
inversely proportional to body weight according to Eq. 1,
small differences in body weight (e.g., deviations of 5 kg) will
have minimal impact on the intake estimates for adults, but
would have a greater impact on intake estimates for children.
Thus, estimates of intake using a combination of NHANES
chemical data and EPA body weight data could overestimate
intakes.
Results
Percentiles and means were estimated for BPA daily intakes
from the 2003­2004 NHANES data based on individual
urinary BPA data and individual body weight data as
described in the previous section. Table 3 gives results by total
population, age group (no data were reported by NHANES
for individuals under the age of 6 years), and gender. Median
BPA intakes for adolescents (12­19-year olds) are higher
than intakes for younger children (6­11-year olds), but the
difference is not statistically significant. Median intakes for
adults (20­60 þ years) are generally lower than for the two
younger age groups, with the 20­39-year old intakes
statistically significantly lower than adolescents' intakes.
Median intakes decline with increasing age (20­39440­
59460 þ ), but the differences among these groups are not
statistically significant. Median BPA intakes are statistically
significantly higher for male subjects compared to female
subjects.
Discussion
On the basis of the NHANES urinary BPA data and the
assumptions described in this paper, median daily BPA
intakes for men are statistically significantly higher than for
women. In addition, there were differences in median daily
BPA intakes according to age groups, with adolescents (12­
19 years) having the highest estimated intakes and the oldest
group (60 þ ) having the lowest estimated intakes. A
downward trend in intake with age starting from adolescence
is apparent.
The underlying NHANES urinary BPA data showed the
same age and gender trends (Table 1), but the dietary intake
estimates are a function of both urinary concentration
(measured for each individual) and daily urinary output
(estimated for groups). A sensitivity analysis for these data
was conducted by assigning a common value of 1400 ml/day

(the average of the values for male and female adults as given
by Valentin, 2002 and ICRP, 2003) for urinary excretion for
adults (leaving the child and adolescent values unchanged) to
better understand the influence of daily urinary output
estimates on daily intake estimates. The results of this
analysis removed the influence of gender in BPA intake.
Additional analyses with adult urinary volumes set at 1200 or
1600 ml/day gave the same result, suggesting that the
removal of gender influence when adult male and female
urinary output volumes are equal is insensitive to the choice
of the urinary output value.
To determine the effect of using creatinine-adjusted urinary
BPA data on the intake estimates, we computed intakes for
the overall sample population using the NHANES data on
individual urinary BPA concentrations, individual urinary
creatinine levels, age, body weight, and ICRP (2003) values
for daily creatinine excretion (using ICRP values for 10-year
olds to represent the 6­11 age group, 15-year olds for the 12­
19 age group, and adult values for the remaining age groups).
We generally found that within age groups F with the
exception of the 6­11-year olds, creatinine-adjusted intake
estimates tend to be lower than intake estimates based on
non-adjusted urinary BPA data (6­11-year olds: B 40%
higher, 12­39-year olds: B50% lower, and 40­60-year olds:
B25% lower). Intake estimates based on creatinine-adjusted
BPA concentrations and non-adjusted concentrations are
fairly highly correlated (correlation coefficients ranging from
75% to 83%).
Although estimates of intake percentiles are presented in
this analysis, caution is warranted in interpreting these
results. There are clear limitations imposed by the underlying
data and the methodology for estimating daily intake.
Estimates of percentiles, particularly those in the tails of
the intake distributions, tend to be sensitive to the measure-
ments made for small numbers of individuals. As a result, the
median values for the cohort will likely provide more reliable
estimates of population median intake. An additional
cautionary note is that intake estimates represent external
doses of parent BPA, not internal serum BPA levels. As
reported by Dekant and Vo
¨ lkel (2008), ``ybisphenol A-
glucuronide formed during first-pass metabolism in the gut
wall and liver is rapidly cleared from blood by the kidneys
and excreted with urine;'' thus, urinary BPA measures are
not representative of serum BPA levels as minimal parent
compound is systemically circulated (CERHR, 2007; Will-
hite et al., 2008).
It is also reasonable to question whether spot urine
samples, as collected and analyzed for NHANES, are
appropriate surrogates for 24-h samples or for longitudinal
sampling of urine when estimating exposure to BPA. It has
been suggested, based on a limited number of studies, that
urinary BPA measures from spot urine samples are appro-
priate for estimating average exposures to populations or
short-term individual exposures (Arakawa et al., 2004;
Dekant and Vo
¨ lkel, 2008; Mahalingaiah et al., 2008), but
that an ``uncertainty of approximately one order of
magnitude has to be accepted when using single spot urine
samples to estimate total daily intake by an individual''
(Dekant and Vo
¨ lkel, 2008). It should be noted that BPA is
rapidly excreted, and it is therefore unlikely that urinary BPA
levels would be constant throughout the day.
Few chemicals have been the subject of investigations into
the temporal variability of environmental chemicals in urine
(McDiarmid et al., 1999; Hinwood et al., 2002; Hauser
et al., 2004; Arakawa et al., 2004; Kissel et al., 2005; Matt
et al., 2007; Scher et al., 2007; Teitelbaum et al., 2007; Adibi
et al., 2008). A study on temporal variability of phenols and
other chemicals in urine was carried out with 29 children who
provided several spot urine samples each over 6 months
(Teitelbaum et al., 2007). Creatinine-corrected urinary BPA
concentrations were moderately correlated out to 12 weeks,
and the authors concluded that the intra-individual stability
in biomarker concentration ``indicates that more-or-less
constant exposure must exist to common environmental
agents,'' as the compounds studied have half-lives of only
hours to days. A study on temporal variability of urinary
BPA in 82 adults (Mahalingaiah et al., 2008) found that a
single urine sample showed ``moderate sensitivity'' for
predicting a person's tertile category. The authors stated
that ``despite within-person variability in urinary BPA
concentrations, a single sample is predictive of long-term
exposure (over weeks and months).'' Arakawa et al. (2004)
found a large between-day variation over 5 consecutive days
based on 24-h urine samples collected from five subjects
(intra-individual variation of 91%). Arakawa et al. con-
cluded that the results suggest that 24-h urine samples should
not be the basis for estimating long-term exposures in an
individual, but they can be useful for estimating average
population intake of BPA in a cross-sectional study. Thus,
although the NHANES cross-sectional data would appear to
provide a reasonable reference range for single day exposures
and for estimating average population exposures (and
therefore intakes), it is less clear whether these data can be
extended to understanding longer term exposures.
The predominant exposure route for BPA is via ingestion
(Wilson et al. 2007; Dekant and Vo
¨ lkel, 2008). In Table 4,
our estimates of daily BPA intake for the US population
based on NHANES urinary BPA data are compared with
recent international intake estimates based on measurements
of BPA in environmental media and migration of BPA from
food packaging to food combined with exposure factors for
ingestion (a review of food and aggregate exposures to BPA
can be found in the CERHR (2007) report). Caution should
be exercised when comparing from our results to the studies
included in Table 4. For example, although the intake values
estimated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA,
2007) (Table 4) are substantially higher than those derived
from urinary BPA data in the United States, according to
Bisphenol A daily intakes in the United States
LaKind and Naiman
612 Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology (2008) 18(6)
EFSA, conservative assumptions were used in its dietary
estimates, possibly explaining the discrepancy. The intakes
determined by Wilson et al. (2007) are similar to our
estimates, but they focus on an age group not represented in
the NHANES data. In a review by Kang et al. (2006), an
upper bound of 1000 ng/kg-day for daily intake is given. On
the basis of the analysis in this paper, in the United States the
95th percentile intake of the population is below 1000 ng/kg-
day, and only 8 of the 2488 individuals in the NHANES
subsample exceeded that upper bound value. In contrast,
Dekant and Vo
¨ lkel (2008) estimate ``reasonable worst case''
adult exposure to BPA to be approximately 100 ng/kg-day
and average exposure to be 60 ng/kg-day. In this assessment,
geometric mean values were below 100 ng/kg-day for all
groupings analyzed. Miyakawa et al. (2006) and Higuchi
et al. (2004) estimated intakes from very specific food types
that would not apply to long-term intakes in the general
population (daily consumption of canned trout and con-
sumption of hospital food, respectively).
Few studies have estimated BPA intake based on urinary
BPA levels. Arakawa et al. (2004) used 24-h urinary BPA
measures from 36 men (mean age 24.7±3 years) to estimate
a maximum intake of 230 ng/kg-day. Miyamoto and Kotake
(2006) used Monte Carlo analysis to estimate daily BPA
based on 24-h urinary BPA data from two studies in Japan
(Arakawa et al., 2004, n ¼ 36 and Tsukioka et al. 2004,
n ¼ 22) in conjunction with several assumptions, including
lognormal distribution of the urinary BPA data, equivalency
of 24-h urinary BPA and BPA intake from the previous day,
and lognormal distribution of body weights with a geometric
mean of 63.4 kg for male subjects and 52.1 for female
subjects. Intake estimates from these two studies are
compared with the estimates from this analysis in Table 5.
The average results from these studies were quite similar,
whereas the high-end estimates of Miyamoto and Kotake
were substantially lower than those from this analysis and
from Arakawa et al., obvious differences in study design,
including numbers and ages of participants, as well as use of
spot versus 24-h samples all likely contribute to the observed
differences.
The current controversy regarding conflicting interpreta-
tion of information from studies of endocrine and reproduc-
tive toxicity (Matsumoto et al., 2003; CERHR, 2007; vom
Saal et al., 2007) is recognized. Health-based guidance values

currently available in the United States and Europe are used
here as a basis for comparison to daily intakes estimated in
this analysis. Both the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA, 2007) and the US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA, 2007) recommend a value of 50 mg/kg-day (50,000 ng/
kg-day) as the tolerable daily intake and reference dose.
These values represent lifetime exposures that are likely to be
without appreciable risk. Median values were below 100 ng/
kg-day for all groups analyzed and the 95th percentiles were
below 400 ng/kg-day (Table 3). Thus, median and 95th
percentile intake estimates were approximately two to three
orders of magnitude below the health-based guidance
value of 50,000 ng/kg-day. Additional research in the
following areas would provide more complete information
for estimating daily intakes of BPA in a population: (i) 24-h
urinary excretion by age and gender, (ii) reliability of
spot urine samples for assessing daily and longer term
urinary BPA levels, and (iii) information on urinary BPA
levels and urinary excretion volumes in children younger than
6 years of age.
