Study objective: Research suggests that economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods confer an increased
risk of depression to their residents. Little research has been reported about the association between ethnic
group concentration and depression. This study investigated the association between neighbourhood
poverty and neighbourhood percentage Mexican American and depressive symptoms for older Mexican
Americans in the south western United States.
Design: A population based study of older non-institutionalised Mexican Americans from the
baseline assessment (1993/94) of the Hispanic established population for the epidemiologic study of
the elderly (H-EPESE) merged with 1990 census data.
Setting: Five south western states in the United States.
Participants: 3050 Mexican Americans aged 65 years or older.
Main results: There was a strong correlation between the percentage of neighbourhood residents living in
poverty and the percentage who were Mexican American (r = 0.62; p,0.001). Percentage neighbour-
hood poverty and percentage Mexican American had significant and opposite effects on level of
depressive symptoms among older Mexican Americans. After adjusting for demographic and other
individual level factors, each 10% increase in neighbourhood population in poverty was associated with a
0.763 (95% CI 0.06 to 1.47) increase in CES-D score, while each 10% increase in Mexican American
neighbourhood population was associated with a 20.548 (95% CI 20.96 to 20.13) unit decrease in
CES-D score among older Mexican Americans residing in their neighbourhoods.
Conclusions: The findings suggest a sociocultural advantage conferred by high density Mexican American
neighbourhoods, and suggest the need to include community level factors along with individual level
factors in community based epidemiological health studies.
Depression is a major health problem for older adults.1 A
number of factors have been consistently identified as
predictors of depressive symptoms including low
formal education, low income, unemployment,2 3 and limited
social contact.4­8 These individual level factors are nested
within more global community level factors such as
neighbourhood composition. As such, there has been grow-
ing interest in investigating higher order contextual factors in
conjunction with individual level factors in an attempt to
better understand the health and wellbeing of the older
adult.9
Initial studies have sought to isolate the effects of
neighbourhood composition on health risk; that is, does
neighbourhood composition confer health risks or benefits on
their residents, independent of the individual attributes of
those residents? Most of the work in this area has reported on
the adverse effects of poor neighbourhoods on health
outcomes, including higher cardiovascular morbidity10 11
and all cause mortality.12 13 Yen and Kaplan14 found the risk
of depression to be twice as high for a majority of older white
and black people living in residential areas with high poverty
rates, after adjusting for age and gender.
In this study, we examine the association between
neighbourhood composition (that is, percentage of Mexican
Americans living in a community and percentage poverty of
households with incomes below the poverty line in a
community) and depressive symptoms for a cross sectional
sample of older Mexican Americans. Older Mexican
Americans are a unique group in which to study community
level and individual level factors on a health outcome. This is
an economically disadvantaged population, with 20% of older
Mexican Americans living in households with poverty level
incomes in 2000.15 Despite their economic disadvantage,
Mexican American neighbourhoods have comparatively
high rates of labour force participation, intact family
structures, home ownership, and residential stability.16­18 If
the quality of social support from community is an important
determinant of health,5 6 we would expect that high density
Mexican American communities may act as a buffer,
protecting older Mexican Americans from some of the
adverse consequences of poverty, such as depression. The
study has three hypotheses. Firstly, increasing tract percen-
tage poverty will be associated with increased depressive
symptoms. Secondly, increasing proportion of older
Mexican Americans in a census tract (a small census based
geographical area) will be associated with decreased depres-
sive symptoms. Thirdly, increasing proportion of older
Mexican Americans in a census tract will moderate the
effects of increasing tract percentage poverty on depressive
symptoms.
METHODS
Sample
Data are from the Hispanic established population for the
epidemiologic study of the elderly (H-EPESE), a population
based study of non-institutionalised Mexican Americans
aged 65 years or older.19 Subjects were selected from the five
south western states of Texas, California, Arizona, Colorado,

and New Mexico. The sample design was for a multistage
area probability cluster sample that involved selection of
counties, census tracts (a small census based geographical
area), and households. In the first stage, counties were
selected if at least 6.6% of the county population was of
Mexican American ethnicity. In the second stage, census
tracts were selected with a probability proportional to
the size of their older (age 65+) Mexican American
population, using counts from the 1990 US census.
There were 206 census tracts in the analysis sample. In
the third stage, census blocks (very small area units
within census tracts) were selected at random in order to
obtain at least 400 households within each census tract.
These households were screened to identify persons in
the target population of older Mexican Americans. The
sampling procedure assures a sample that is genera-
lisable to the about 500 000 older Mexican Americans
living in the south west. The five states in the H-EPESE
sampling frame contain 85% of the 65 and older Mexican
American population living in the United States. The
response rate at baseline (1993/1994) was 83%.19 In-home
interviews were conducted in Spanish or English. This study
included 2710 persons where complete data were available on
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression (CES-D)
scale.
Measures
Physiological level factors
Physiological level factors included chronic disease and
activities of daily living (ADL) limitations. Subjects were
asked at the baseline assessment if they had a physician
diagnosis of heart attack, stroke, cancer, or diabetes. For each
subject the number of individual chronic diseases reported
was totalled and a summary chronic disease scale was

created with a range of 0 to 4. At the baseline assessment
65.5% reported no chronic disease, 26.5% reported one
chronic disease, and 8% reported two or more chronic
diseases. ADLs were assessed at baseline assessment accord-
ing to a modified version of the Katz Activities of Daily Living
Scale.20 Subjects were coded as ADL disabled if they reported
one or more ADL limitations: bathing, using the toilet,
transferring from bed to chair, walking across a small room,
personal grooming, dressing, and eating.20 At the baseline
assessment 88.9% reported no ADL limitations, and 11.1%
reported one or more ADL limitations.
Individual level factors
Individual level factors included age, gender, marital status,
highest grade of schooling completed, per capita household
income, and place of birth (Mexico compared with US born).
Highest grade of schooling completed was categorised as 0 to
6 years, 7 to 11 years, and 12 years or more. Per capita
household income was expressed as a ratio to county median
household income to adjust for the sharp differences in cost
of living across the study area, and was logged for the
regression analysis to normalise the distribution of the
variable. Of sample respondents, 59% were women, 44%
were foreign born, and 44% were unmarried.
Data were missing because of item non-response for
schooling (34 cases; 1.2% of sample) and household income
(268 cases; 9.3%). In both cases, missing values were
imputed using best subset regression. Education was
imputed using information about age, gender, tract education
level, immigrant status, English language ability, census
occupation, and personal income. Household income was
imputed using personal income, house value, number of
persons in household, marital status, education, English
language ability, state of residence, median income of county
of residence, and reported financial strain. There were no
substantive changes in reported regression parameters when
cases were imputed rather than excluded.
Community level factors
Neighbourhood characteristics were measured using data
from the 1990 census for the 206 census tracts where subjects
lived at baseline. Sample subjects had a high degree of
residential stability. The median year in which subjects
moved into their current dwelling at the 1993­94 baseline
assessment was 1974. Neighbourhood percentage Mexican
American was scaled from 0 to 1, where higher scores
indicate greater homogeneity. Neighbourhood socioeconomic
status was operationalised by the percentage of persons living
in households with income below poverty by the census
definition,21 and was scaled from 0 to 1, where lower scores
indicate increased neighbourhood poverty.
Figure 1 presents the scatterplot of percentage Mexican
American compared with percentage neighbourhood poverty
for the 206 census tracts in the Hispanic EPESE study. There
was a strong linear association (r = 0.62) between percentage
Mexican American and percentage neighbourhood poverty.
Correlations of this magnitude are common in hierarchical
models of contextual effects on individual behaviours.22 This
is the case because important dimensions of community
structure are typically more highly correlated than are
individual level variables. The variance inflation factor
(VIF) of 1.69 that is associated with this correlation,
calculated for the 206 census tracts, was well below the
threshold (VIF = 10) that would indicate a problem of
multicollinearity in multivariate regression models.23 That
is, there is sufficient independent variation of neighbourhood
poverty and percentage Mexican American to investigate
both effects as distinct characteristics of neighbourhood
context.

Depressive symptoms
Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D
scale.24 The CES-D consisted of 20 items where subjects are
asked whether they have experienced certain feelings or
symptoms in the past week. Responses were scored on a four
point scale (0 to 3). Scores for the CES-D ranged from 0 to 60
where higher scores indicated increased depressive sympto-
matology. In the analysis, the CES-D scale was used both as a
continuous and a categorical variable (0­15 and >16).
Subjects with a score of 16 or more were classified as having
high depressive symptomatology.24
Statistical analysis
Using descriptive statistics, sociodemographic and health
factors were examined for all subjects on mean CES-D score
at the baseline assessment interview. Bivariate regression
statistics were used to test the strength of the association
between neighbourhood percentage Mexican American and
neighbourhood poverty. To perform this analysis, we capita-
lised on the fact that the primary sampling units (PSUs) for
the H-EPESE sample design were a random sample of census
tracts in the five south western states. Census tracts have
been found to be a useful approximation for neighbourhood
environments in numerous studies of contextual influences
on social behaviour and health.25­27 Thus we estimated two
level random intercept linear regression models, using HLM
software distributed by Scientific Software International. The
second level in this analysis, neighbourhood, are the census
tracts that are the primary sampling units for the study. We
regress depressive symptoms on neighbourhood tract percen-
tage Mexican American and neighbourhood poverty, adjust-
ing for age, gender, marital status, Mexico (compared with
US) birth, a number of medical conditions, and ADL
limitations. We tested additional cross level interactions
between neighbourhood characteristics and individual char-
acteristics including age, gender, neighbourhood poverty,
medical condition, and ADLs using random slopes models.
No significant interactions were identified and these models
are not reported. The linear regression analyses were
weighted using post-stratification weights so that the results
are representative of the older Mexican American population
of the south western states.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents mean CES-D scores for neighbourhood and
individual level data. Community level data are presented by
the percentage of a neighbourhood population that was
Mexican American and also the percentage of a neighbour-
hood that was living in poverty. There was a trend for older
Mexican Americans living in higher density Mexican
American neighbourhoods to report lower mean CES-D
scores. No such trend appeared for the association between
tract percentage poverty and mean CES-D score. The
intraclass correlation (percentage of variance that occurs
between neighbourhoods) for the CES-D score was 24%. For
the individual level data older age, female gender, being
unmarried, and less formal education was associated with
higher mean CES-D scores. Additionally, having a lower per
capita household income relative to the county median, being
born in Mexico, reporting one or more chronic medical
conditions or one or more ADL limitations were associated
with higher mean CES-D scores.
Table 2 presents unstandardised b coefficients for the
prediction of continuous CES-D scores (range 0­60) by
percentage Mexican American and percentage neighbour-
hood poverty, adjusting for relevant individual level factors.
Model 1 indicates a non-significant association between
percentage neighbourhood poverty and CES-D score with
adjustments for age and sex. Similarly, Model 2 indicates a
non-significant association between percentage neighbour-
hood Mexican American and CES-D score. In Model 3 with
both percentage neighbourhood poverty and percentage
Mexican American included in the model, older Mexican
Americans who reside in the highest percentage Mexican
American census tracts had a 5.16 point decrease in CES-D
score compared with those who live in the lowest percentage
Mexican American census tracts. Mexican Americans who
live in the highest percentage neighbourhood poverty areas
had a 7.64 point increase in CES-D score compared with
those in the lowest percentage neighbourhood poverty census
tracts. Because the results are linear and additive, another
way of describing the findings in Model 3 is to say that each
10% increase in percentage Mexican American was asso-
ciated with a 0.516 point decrease in CES-D score, while each
10% increase in percentage poverty was associated with a
0.764 point increase in CES-D score. In the fully adjusted
model results for percentage neighbourhood poverty and
percentage Mexican American with CES-D score were similar
to model 3 results.
Figure 2 shows the association among percentage neigh-
bourhood poverty and percentage Mexican American with
percentage of subjects with high (>16) CES-D scores, with
adjustment for individual level data. The figure indicates a
gradient of risk for percentage Mexican American and
percentage neighbourhood poverty on high depressive
symptoms (CES-D score >16). Subjects living in the lowest
density Mexican American communities and in lowest
percentage poverty tracts had the lowest risk of depression.
At each level of neighbourhood poverty, neighbourhoods
with the highest percentage Mexican American residents had
the lowest rates of subjects with high depression scores.
DISCUSSION
Using a population based cohort, our findings indicate that
high density Mexican American communities moderate the
adverse consequences of poverty on the psychological well-
being of its residents. In an unadjusted analysis no clear
pattern was observed between tract percentage poverty and
depressive symptoms, and a weak association was observed

hierarchical logistic regression model of high depressive symptoms
(CES-D >16) using factors from table 2 (model 4), evaluated at the
mean (age = 71 years, percentage county income = 18%) and mode
(female, ,12 grades of school, US born, and no medical conditions or
ADL limitations) of individual level data.

between tract percentage Mexican American and depressive
symptoms. When both factors were included in the same
model both neighbourhood poverty and neighbourhood
density of Mexican American were significantly associated
with the risk of depressive symptoms, in opposite directions.
For example, each 10% unit increase in tract percentage
Mexican American was associated with approximately a 0.5
point decrease in depressive symptom score as measured by
the CES-D.
Although results from previous studies point to a strong
positive association between community poverty and poor
health,28­30 our current data indicate that high neighbourhood
ethnic density may buffer the deleterious effect of poverty on
health. Our findings are concordant with, and suggest a
mechanism that helps to explain, the so called ``Hispanic
paradox'' that older Mexican Americans have many health
indicators similar to or better than that of more advantaged
older non-Hispanic white people despite clear disadvantages
in terms of income, health insurance, housing, and educa-
tion.31­34 One hypothesis offered to explain this ``Hispanic
paradox'' is that strong social and family support structures
buffer the effects of low social and economic status.35 36 Our
results could be seen as further evidence of the importance of
social networks and social cohesiveness at the community
level.
A shared cultural identity, common language and appear-
ance may contribute to the health of the individual. A recent
cohort study by Hjern and colleagues37 examined social
adjustment of intercountry adopted children on mental
health disorders in Sweden. The study found intercountry
adoptees were three to five times more likely to develop
psychiatric illnesses than native born people. One explana-
tion offered was that discrimination and prejudice could be
higher for non-Swedish appearance, negatively impacting on
the mental health of the person.
Strongly held community beliefs may also lead to the
adoption or change of health practices or behaviours.
However, the direction for change can either be positive or
negative. For example, at the individual level strong marriage
and good friendship ties are associated with less smoking and
alcohol intake, better nutrition, and more cancer screening,
while less successful marriages or friendships are associated
with an increase risk for poor health behaviours.38 Lower
rates of smoking and drinking and drug use are reported for
Mexican Americans, particularly among immigrants and
women.31 39
A unique characteristic of many high density Mexican
American communities is that they are stable environments
where labour force participation, intact family structures,
home ownership, and residential stability are all compara-
tively high.16­18 Ross has suggested that the association
between neighbourhood poverty and depression is mediated
by increased social disorder.28 That is, in many high poverty
neighbourhoods a resident's daily experiences are more likely
to include exposure to crime, vandalism, noise pollution, and
overcrowding than in more advantaged neighbourhoods. If
Ross is correct, then the negative effects of neighbourhood
poverty on mental health may be attenuated where material
disadvantage is not accompanied by a high degree of social
disorganisation. Immigrant and ethnic enclaves present
examples of community contexts where concentrated eco-
nomic disadvantage is frequently not accompanied by other
social pathologies because of the offsetting buffering effects
of high levels of group cohesion.
Interpretation of our findings should take into account
several considerations. It is possible that older Mexican
Americans from high density Mexican American neighbour-
hoods may be more likely to migrate to Mexico in response to
ill health including high depressive symptoms. However,
follow up data on this cohort suggest that few older Mexican
Americans return to Mexico. The associations reported are
cross sectional rather than longitudinal and reflect differ-
ential degrees of exposure to community environments.
However, older Mexican Americans experience a high degree
of residential stability. The median length of residence at
current address at the time of the survey was 22 years.
Finally, no direct measure of social support variable was
included in the analysis. Theoretical considerations suggest
that high levels of social support associated with high levels
of tract percentage Mexican American may explain the lower
depressive symptoms associated with variables. However, this
hypothesis was not directly tested in this study. The
importance of our findings is based on the following
strengths of the investigation. We collected information from
a large well defined sample, which is generalisable to 500 000
Mexican Americans living in the south western United
States.19 The reliability and consistency of the data collection
procedures in the Hispanic EPESE investigation are well
established.19
In conclusion, our findings suggest the need for careful
examination of neighbourhood effects on health. This
examination should go beyond negative community factors
and include positive factors such as local resources and social
cohesiveness and neighbourhood composition.
