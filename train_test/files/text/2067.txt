We examine whether individual and neighborhood socioeconomic context contributes to black/white disparities in mortality
among USA older adults. Using national longitudinal data from the Americans' Changing Lives study, along with census tract
information for each respondent, we conduct multilevel survival analyses. Results show that black older adults are disadvantaged
in mortality in younger old age, but older black adults have lower mortality risk than whites after about age 80. Both individual SES
and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage contribute to the mortality risk of older adults but do not completely explain race
differences in mortality. The racial mortality crossover persists even after controlling for multilevel SES, suggesting that black older
adults experience selective survival at very old ages. Addressing the individual and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage of
blacks is necessary to reduce mortality disparities that culminate in older adulthood.
1. Introduction
Black older adults (ages 65+) have higher all-cause mortality
rates than white older adults in the USA [1, 2]. A growing
body of literature attempts to understand the mechanisms
explaining these persisting race differences in mortality [3­5]
so that we can understand how such race disparities might be
reduced or eliminated. Substantial disparities in individual
socioeconomic status (SES) by race have been observed in
the USA, and research has shown that individual SES (e.g.,
income and education) partly mediates but does not elim-
inate the relationship between race and mortality [6­8]. In
addition, neighborhood context has been identified as a key
factor that contributes to race disparities in morbidity [9­
11]. However, few studies have examined how neighborhood
context contributes to race difference in mortality [12, 13],
particularly at older ages.
The current study employees mixed effect survival
analysis to investigate whether SES, measured at both the
individual and neighborhood levels, explains black/white
differences in mortality among older adults in the USA, using
longitudinal national data.
A number of theoretical perspectives, including eco-
nomic deprivation [14] and social disorganization theory
[15, 16], suggest that neighborhood context is associated
with health and mortality. Some studies have shown that
living in a poor neighborhood is related to increased cause-
specific mortality among adults [17­20], after controlling
for individual SES variables. However, other studies have
shown that there is no significant association between
neighborhood context and all-cause mortality for older
adults [11, 21, 22].
Very few studies have examined the contribution of
neighborhood socioeconomic context to race disparities
2 Journal of Aging Research
in mortality for older adults, although some research
has examined this question for younger and middle-aged
adults. LeClere and colleagues found that the differential
all-cause mortality rates between African American and
non-Hispanic white men and women aged 18 and older
were partly explained by individual-level SES and were
further explained by neighborhood context. The differences
in mortality between the black and white adults were
completely explained by both individual SES and neigh-
borhood combined [23]. However, some studies indicate
that race differences in mortality persist among USA adults
even after both individual SES and neighborhood context
are controlled. For example, one study demonstrated that
mortality for all racial/ethnic groups is related to individual
SES and to neighborhood characteristics, among people
aged 18­64. The race difference in mortality persisted after
controlling for both individual and neighborhood level SES
[24].
With regard to older adults, LeClere and colleagues
showed that the percentage of female-headed families in
the neighborhood was associated with heart disease mor-
tality for women aged 65 and above. Individual SES and
neighborhood context fully accounted for the heart disease
mortality disparity between white and black older adults
[12]. The above research provides some knowledge about
the relationships among race, multilevel SES, and all-cause
mortality, but the results are not consistent.
Moreover, this body of research has not fully considered
the shape of the relationship between race and mortality
at older ages. However, research suggests that there is a
racial mortality crossover at older ages such that black older
adults have higher mortality than white older adults in young
older ages while white older adults have higher mortality
than their black counterparts in very late old age [25­30].
It could be that the racial mortality crossover in late old age
contributes to the inconsistent conclusions regarding the role
of multilevel SES in explaining race difference in mortality
among older adults. This is because if crossover effects exist,
the effect of race on mortality for a younger subgroup will be
positive while the effect of race will be negative for an older
age subgroup. Combining age groups together in one "old
age" group ages 65+ may result in the positive and negative
effects canceling each other out.
There are two primary competing explanations for racial
mortality crossover effects [27]. If black older adults are
more likely to misreport their age as older than it really is,
this would result in more young black older adults being
categorized in the oldest old groups. Alternately, black older
adults may experience selective mortality. Since black adults
are more likely to die at younger ages, the black survivors
at very older age should be very robust. Unfortunately, it is
difficult to detect age reporting errors in survey data. In any
case, the potential existence of the racial mortality crossover
effect means that, when studying race differences in mortality
among older adults, it is necessary to consider the interaction
of race and age.
There have been theoretical debates on the expected
patterns of race disparities in mortality over the life course.
The double jeopardy hypothesis suggests that blacks are
faced with a double burden on health with aging and there-
fore should experience worse health status and mortality
compared to whites at older ages [31]. Another perspective
hypothesizes persistent inequality--that race differences in
health are set at earlier ages and are then relatively stable
throughout the aging process [32]. These two perspectives
suggest that crossover effects should not exist. A third
perspective describes a different story in which some factors
that affect health at younger ages are not as strongly
associated with changes in health at older ages. In particular,
social factors may be less important than biological factors
at older ages. For example, the research by House et al.
[33] suggests that the relationship between SES, other risk
factors, and health may be buffered by biological robustness
(in early adulthood), biological frailty (in later old age), or
the existence of social welfare programs, particularly at older
ages. This third perspective suggests that the race difference
will reduce or even crossover at older ages.
Empirical studies provide some support for the third
perspective and have shown that the health disadvantage
of blacks not only disappears but crosses over such that
black older adults have lower mortality ratios at very old
ages (around age 80) [27, 34, 35]. If this crossover effect
happens, it may obscure the true relationships among
race, multilevel SES and mortality among older adults in
different age groups. Given this consideration, we examine
the potential for a race crossover effect in mortality among
older adults and reexamine the contribution of multilevel
SES to mortality and its variation by age among older adults.
Our study extends prior work in a number of ways.
The existing literature has contrary findings on the effects
of neighborhood context on mortality and the magnitude
of the effects of neighborhood context on explaining race
differences in mortality among older adults. A number of
limitations to prior work may cause this contradiction.
First, as described above, most studies examine all older
adults combined, rather than examining age-specific changes
among older adults. Second, most studies examined disease-
specific mortality, but it is also important to understand
how multilevel SES is associated with all-cause mortality.
Third, most previous studies used a single indicator or
separate indicators of neighborhood context, whereas we
combine a number of neighborhood variables to create a
more comprehensive neighborhood disadvantage index.
Fourth, our statistical approach represents an improve-
ment on prior work in the USA because we use multilevel
survival analyses to account for the multilevel nature of the
data while modeling mortality using the greater precision
of survival analysis. Most prior work in the USA has
not adjusted for the complex survey design effects that
result from the multistate sampling method of the data
or the nested nature of the individual-level data within
neighborhoods, leading to potentially incorrect variance
and parameter estimates [36­38]. Some studies considered
the correlated data structure and used multilevel logistic
regression to estimate the association between multilevel SES
and mortality [11, 22, 39, 40]. But in these studies, censoring
issues were not addressed leading to potential errors in esti-
mates. Recently, a few studies employed multilevel survival
Journal of Aging Research 3
analysis, which combines the advantages of mixed effects
model and Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the
effects of multilevel SES on cause-specific mortality [17­
19, 41] and all-cause mortality [42]. However, these studies
were based in European countries. We utilize this method
using a USA sample.
In sum, results regarding the effects of neighborhood
SES on mortality and its contribution to race differences
in mortality among older adults are mixed. Some national
studies provided evidence that multilevel SES is associated
with mortality and contributes to explaining race differences
in mortality [12, 23, 24, 43]. However, there is still a debate
on the magnitude of their contribution to race differences
in mortality, particularly at older ages. We build from and
attempt to improve upon prior work by introducing an
interaction between race and age. We also use multilevel
survival models to appropriately estimate the associations
between race, the interaction of race and age, individual SES,
neighborhood SES, and all-cause mortality over 16 years
among older adults in a nationally representative sample of
adults in the USA.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data. Wave 1 (W1) of the Americans Changing Lives
(ACL) study was conducted in 1986 through face-to-face
interviews in the homes of 3,617 adults. The sample was
created using a multistage, stratified area probability sample
of noninstitutionalized adults aged 25 and older living in the
48 contiguous states, with oversamples of black people and
older adults. We limit our analysis to the cohort of people
ages 65 and older in order to replicate and extend previous
studies that looked at this age cohort [3, 25, 44, 45]. The
analytic sample used in this study includes respondents aged
65 or older at W1 (with survivors being aged 81 or older at
wave 4) who reported their race as white or black, for a final
analytic sample of 1211 respondents aged 65 and older at W1.
Neighborhood variables are taken from the 1990 census
at the census tract level, based on each individual's residence
at W1 of the interview.
Data were collected by the University of Michigan using
approved human subjects protocols. Data analyses were
conducted with approval by the University of Wisconsin-
Madison social studies institutional review board.
2.2. Variables. Education is measured as years of formal
schooling completed by W1 and is included as a continuous
variable. Family income at baseline is included as an
ordinal variable ranging from 1 to 10 (1 = less than $5K;
2 = $5K-$9999; 3 = $10K-14,999; 4 = $15K-19,999;
5 = $20K-24,999; 6 = $25K-29,999; 7 = $30K-39,999;
8 = $40K-59,999; 9 = $60K-79,999; 10 = $80K and
above). Regression-based imputations were made for missing
income data.
Five neighborhood characteristics (% adults aged 25+
with 16+ years schooling, % households with public assis-
tance, % persons aged 65+ below poverty line, % families
that are female-headed, and mean family income) are used
to create a neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage index
(Neighborhood SDI). After conducting a factor analysis
(see Table 3), each of the five neighborhood measures was
standardized, weighted by its factor loading, and summed (%
adults aged 25+ with 16+ years schooling and mean family
income were reversed) to create the Neighborhood SDI. A
higher score means greater neighborhood disadvantage.
Gender is coded 1 for men and 0 for women. Race is a
dummy variable (Black = 1; White = 0).
The dependent variable at each wave is all-cause mor-
tality. Mortality was tracked over time and was confirmed
with the National Death Index (coded to the year of death)
through wave 4 (2001) [33].
2.3. Statistical Analysis. Survival analysis is used to examine
predictors of time until death. The basic Cox proportional
hazards regression is expressed as [46, 47]
h(t | Z) = h0(t)exp


p
k=1
k
Zk

. (1)
h(t | Z) is the hazard rate at time t for an individual
covariates vector Z. h0(t) is an arbitrary baseline hazard
rate. k is the estimated parameter vector that represents the
direction and magnitude of the association between Zk and
h(t | Z) compared to baseline hazard rate. If we assume
that censoring time and event for the jth participants are
independent given by Zk, the parameters in (1) could be
estimated by maximizing the partial likelihood function in
L  =
D
i=1
exp p
k=1
k
Z(i)k
jR(ti)
exp p
k=1
k
Zjk
. (2)
In (2), let t1
> t2
... < TD denote the ordered event times.
Z(i)k is the kth covariate associated with individual whose
death time is ti. R(ti) represents the kth covariate associated
with individuals who are still in the risk set at a time just prior
to ti. The numerator in (2) represents the information about
death where the denominator includes all information about
individuals who have not yet died.
When neighborhood socioeconomic context is included
in analysis, we model the association between individual sur-
vival times within neighborhood. There is an unobservable
random effect shared by subjects within a neighborhood.
In this case, Cox proportional hazard mixed effects model
(PHMM) is appropriate [46, 48, 49]. To simplify the model,
one time-invariant neighborhood socioeconomic context
variable is included in the analysis. The hazard function for
the jth individual in i neighborhood can be expressed as
[50, 51]
hij(t | Z) = h0(t) exp  Zij + bi
ij
. (3)
Zij is the vector covariate and  is the vector of regression
coefficient. ij is a vector of covariates that have random
effects. This equation captures the random effects of the
cluster and enables covariate by cluster interactions. Due to
the interaction of clustered and individual covariates, ij is a
subset of Zij [51, 52].

2.4. Analytic Strategy. A series of Cox proportional hazard
models will be presented to examine the association between
race, multilevel SES, and mortality. Models 1 to 4 in Table 2
use Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the
contribution of both individual SES and neighborhood SDI
to race differences in mortality when neighborhood-level
variance is ignored. Mixed effect cox analyses are shown
in Models 1b to 4b in Table 2 in order to examine how
multilevel SES explains race disparity in mortality when
we consider the neighborhood-level variance. Finally, the
interaction between race and age is introduced in Models 5
to 7 to investigate whether race differences in mortality differ
by different age groups after multilevel SES is controlled.
3. Results
Table 1 presents the descriptive information for the demo-
graphic and socioeconomic measures at baseline for 1211
older adults aged 65 and above who reported their race as
either white or black. About one third of participants were
male, about 45% were married at baseline, and the average
age was 73. The mean years of education are about 10. The
average family income was in the range of $15,000 to $19,999
in 1986.
The effects of individual SES and neighborhood SDI
on mortality are presented in Table 2. Model 1 in Table 2
shows that black older adults had a higher mortality rate
(e0.167 = 1.18) than white older adults. The probability
of dying (at an earlier age or by the end of the study
period) for black older adults is on average 18% higher
than the probability of death for white older adults. When
only individual SES measures were added in Model 2, race
differences in mortality disappeared and family income is
negatively related to mortality. Model 3 examines the effects
of neighborhood SDI on mortality. First, we find that neigh-
borhood SDI is positively associated with mortality. This
model suggests that, if the neighborhood socioeconomic
disadvantage index increases by one standard deviation, the
probability of death increases by 10% (e0.091 = 1.0953).
Race differences in mortality persist after controlling for
neighborhood SDI. Both individual SES and neighborhood
SES were included simultaneously in Model 4. Model 4
indicates that both family income and neighborhood SDI
are significantly related to mortality. However, there is no
remaining statistically significant race difference in mortality.
Models 1b­4b in Table 2, using mixed effects Cox
model, demonstrate similar results. Both individual SES and
neighborhood SDI are related to mortality. Race differences
in mortality are fully mediated by individual SES. Looking at
Models 2­4 and 2b­4b together, we conclude that individual
SES is stronger than neighborhood SDI in explaining race
differences in mortality.
The interaction of race by age was added in Models 5­7
in Table 2 in order to investigate whether race disparities in
mortality vary by age among older adults. Model 5 indicates
that there is a significant interaction of race and age, which
means that race differences in mortality are not constant
across age for older adults. The positive coefficients for race
and age and the negative coefficient for the interaction of
race and age support theories that suggest a diminishing
or crossover effect of race rather than theories suggesting a
double jeopardy hypothesis. The positive coefficient of race
suggests that black adults experienced a greater risk of death
at young old ages. The negative coefficient of the interaction
of race and age shows that black older adults' risk of morality
increases at a slower rate than white older adults' risk. We
compute the turning point age where black and white older
adults have an equal risk of mortality after controlling other
covariates in Model 5. The formula is 3.0281 + 0.106age -
0.038age = 3.0280 + 0106age - 0.0380 and we get age =
79.68. This means that after around age 80, black older adults
had lower risk of dying than whites.
In Model 6, we include individual SES measures to
examine their effects on mortality and their contribution to
race differences in mortality by age. First, as in Models 1­
4 and Models 1b­4b, family income is negatively associated
with mortality. Second, including individual SES measures
reduced but did not fully explain race differences in mortality
by age.
Neighborhood SDI is added in Model 7. We see that
living in a neighborhood with greater disadvantage is
associated with a greater risk of dying (e0.086 = 1.09), net
of demographic, and individual SES variables, and it further
reduces the association between race and mortality by age.
Again, there remains a significant racial crossover effect on
mortality due to the positive coefficient of race and negative
coefficient of the interaction of race and age. The turning
point of the crossover is about 74 after controlling for SES
at multiple levels.
Finally, all variances of neighborhood tracts are signifi-
cant in Models 1b to 4b and Models 5 to 7. The standard error
presents how much an individual neighborhood varies in its
mortality rate compared to the norm [53, 54]. For example,
the variance is 0.0051 in Model 4b. Its standard error is 0.07.
This suggests that an individual neighborhood has an average
7 percent higher or lower mortality level compared to the
norm. This relatively large variation between neighborhoods
suggests that it is appropriate to model neighborhood-level
variance in mortality analyses among older adults.

In additional analyses, we tested whether race differences
in mortality vary by other covariates by testing the interac-
tions of race and other covariates (see Table 4). The results
show that no other interactions are significant.
4. Discussion
We examined the role of individual SES and neighborhood
SES in explaining race differences in all-cause mortality over
time among black and white older adults. We explicitly
tested whether race disparities in mortality vary by age and
examined the contribution of individual and neighborhood
SES to explaining age variations in these race disparities.
One debate in previous studies is whether there are
effects of neighborhood SES on mortality for older adults.
Some studies found that neighborhood context has no
effects on mortality, while other studies showed that there
is an association between neighborhood and mortality [22].
We believe that inconsistencies in prior work may be
partly due to the fact that most prior work did not take
into account the correlated data structure and censoring
issues related to examining mortality data over time. We
applied a multilevel survival approach (COX PH model with
mixed effects) to estimate the effects of neighborhood on
mortality. We found that older adults who lived in more
disadvantaged neighborhoods had a higher mortality rate,
which is consistent with the studies that used COX PH
model with mixed effects in other countries [17­19, 39].
Thus, we have more confidence in concluding that there is a
significant relationship between neighborhood SDI and all-
cause mortality among older adults in the USA.
The second debate is whether individual SES and neigh-
borhood SES help explain race differences in mortality for
older adults. Although only very few studies have implicitly
examined this issue, the results have been inconsistent.
Some studies showed that individual SES fully mediates the
relationship between race and mortality, while other studies
found that individual SES helped explain the difference
with neighborhood context further explaining the difference.
However, none of these prior studies considered or modeled
the race crossover effect of mortality between black and white
older adults.
In this study, we examined the contribution of individual
SES and neighborhood SDI to mortality through two sets
of analysis--with and without modeling a racial crossover
effect. The analysis without modeling a potential crossover
effect showed that individual SES fully mediated the relation-
ship between race and mortality. However, the analysis with
the interaction term between age and race demonstrated that
there is a race crossover effect and further indicated that race
differences in mortality persist after both individual SES and
neighborhood SDI were controlled. Our analysis suggests
that the crossover effect happens around ages 76­80, which
is consistent with previous studies [27, 34].
There are a number of implications of this study. First,
our study suggests that age reporting bias is probably not
the main reason for the racial crossover in mortality. This
is because, even if more young black older adults were falsely
categorized into the oldest old groups, social factors still exert
a large effect on race difference in mortality since significant
race differences in mortality exist between blacks and whites
at early older age. At the oldest ages, the aging process
itself, especially biological factors, may have more weight on
mortality and health [33]. Given our data and findings, our
results are consistent with a selective mortality explanation
for the racial crossover in mortality at later old age for black
and white older adults. The selective survival of robust black
older adults likely explains the racial crossover.
Another important finding is that our analyses reveal
that individual SES explains more of the race differences in
mortality than does neighborhood SDI. This is consistent
with previous studies [13]. However, we must keep in
mind that some of the neighborhood effects on mortality
may work through their effects on individual-level income

over the life course. Actual neighborhood effects are likely
understated when individual-level income is controlled.
There are a number of limitations to our study. First,
we only include white and black older adults in our
analysis due to sample limitations of racial/ethnic distri-
bution in the ACL data. Future studies should examine
how individual and neighborhood socioeconomic context
contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in mortality between
other racial/ethnic groups. Second, we only include baseline
individual SES and neighborhood SDI variables in the
analysis. Using these static measures may underestimate
their effects on mortality and in explaining race disparities
in mortality [55]. Examining how dynamic individual SES
and neighborhood SDI measures affect mortality over time
for older adults is an interesting and challenging research
direction for the future.
Third, we limited our analysis to the cohort of older
adults aged 65 and above. It may be interesting to compare
the results with other age cutoffs and cohorts. Cohort is an
important concept in life course theory [56], which expects
that people born at a particular time (cohort effect) may
experience similar life events that will affect their life path,
SES, health, and mortality [57]. For example, the type and
degree of racial discrimination experienced may differ by
cohort, affecting race differences in the accumulation of
individual-level SES and neighborhood segregation. Testing
cohort differences in future research could enrich theory
and evidence about how multilevel SES contributes to race
difference in mortality.
5. Conclusion
Our study extends previous research and contributes to
the literature in two major ways. First, we use appropriate
statistical methods to estimate the association between
multilevel socioeconomic status (at individual and neigh-
borhood levels) and mortality and confirm that older adults
living in a disadvantaged neighborhood context experience
higher risk of dying at earlier old ages, beyond the impact
of individual SES. Second, we demonstrate that there are
race crossover effects in mortality at later old age, with
black older adults having a mortality advantage at later
old age. Moreover, neighborhood SDI helps explain race
differences in mortality at older ages. Finally, race differences
in mortality did not disappear even after controlling for both
individual SES and neighborhood SDI measures once we
modeled the racial crossover effect on mortality.
These results help resolve debates in previous studies
and help us better understand the association among race,
individual SES, and neighborhood context. The socioeco-
nomic contexts that affect black and white Americans into
old age affect their mortality risk, leading to selective survival
among the most robust black older adults at later old ages.
Addressing the individual and neighborhood socioeconomic
disadvantage of black people over the life course is necessary
to reduce mortality disparities that culminate in early older
adulthood.
