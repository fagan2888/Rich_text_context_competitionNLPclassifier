Introduction
The concept of border is a key concept in geography. As
Ciattoni (2003) puts it, "border" is an insatiable geographi-
cal object. Associated with the concept of territory, the "bor-
der" is a universal structure, an organizational scheme
fundamental to social and human life on Earth. The "border"
is also a changing geographic reality that can be addressed
in so many ways and can take many forms: linear, zoned, or
simply mental and imaginary.
In geography, the territory is space appropriated for a
certain social group and the "border" is the physical or psy-
chological limit of that territory. Globalization created new
territories and new "borders" not always easy to cross--but
they all exist and coexist giving new meanings to the idea
of space appropriation. Geographical space has gained all
these dimensions and can no longer be viewed in terms of
its materiality.
Geography education is inevitably connected to these
new approaches of territory and its limits, as the multicul-
tural dimension of societies has made it impossible to
ignore that many global issues are now reflected in our
countries, regions, cities, and of course in our schools. And
for a subject specially designed to understanding the rela-
tions between nature and society and its impacts in our
daily lives, the notion of inclusion and exclusion is particu-
larly relevant. It is a geographical concern to understand
how students can acquire knowledge that prepares them to
analyze and understand the complex and relevant problems
in this world of multiple relations.
This is also a teachers'concern expressed in many studies
done in Portuguese schools. The complex world is no longer
a distant reality but it is here in our lives and in our class-
rooms. The "borders" geography education addresses are not
just national borders or European ones but they are increas-
ingly social and physiological. And these are many times the
most difficult ones to address. Through citizenship educa-
tion, teachers in general and geography teachers in particular
try to address many issues related with the need to develop
critical thinking about complex global issues that are now a
reality in their lives.
Portuguese schools are multicultural territories where
sometimes the borders in terms of social divisions and the
invisible and visible lines between groups are very real and it
is important to challenge those borders which deny freedoms,
rights, and capabilities. This article shows that school geogra-
phy has been trying to "tear down walls" in what concerns the
understanding of the world. First, we refer to the meaning of
"citizenship education." Then, the article focuses on present-
ing the nature of school diversity and how school geography,
through teachers' voices, provides a territorial dimension of
analyses important in an effective citizenship education and
practices.
This multiscale analysis is important when thinking about
citizenship at different levels and its impact in human and
social development. It allows to analyze problems at local,
regional, national, and global level and critically analyze its
impacts also at different levels. The methodology of research

Geography Education and Citizenship
Education in Portugal:A Challenge
for the 21st Century
Maria Helena Esteves1
Abstract
The contribution of geography education to citizenship education is recognized by geography educators. Still, globalization
created new territories and new "borders" not always easy to cross--but they all exist and coexist giving new meanings to
the idea of space appropriation. Geographical space has gained all these dimensions and can no longer be viewed in terms
of its materiality.This article addresses the concept of citizenship education for Portuguese geography teachers within the
multicultural nature of Portuguese society and schools. A final reference is given to the importance of cities as places of
citizenship education.

consists of documental analyses about recent changes in the
composition of Portuguese schools, recent changes in school
geography, and teachers' perceptions regarding citizenship
education, using a qualitative paradigm of research.
It also includes an analysis of which geography contents
better adapt to dealing with problems of diversity, inclusion,
and exclusion, as well as the experiences teachers consider
more appropriate to debate these issues. The data presented
are selected from a broader research that intends to prove
that many of these approaches can be made at local level, or
in other words, that cities can be spaces where the benefits
and problems of globalization can be found and studied and
where the notion of territory and border can give an impor-
tant framework to geographical education in Portuguese
schools.
The Meaning of Citizenship Education
A wide range of terms is used worldwide to denote a form of
teaching and learning that in some way encourages good
citizenship. These include citizenship education, civics,
social studies, life skills, and moral education. In addition,
there are relations with a variety of subjects (e.g., history,
geography, economics, politics, languages, environmental
studies, and religious education). Discussion of citizenship
education therefore encompasses a diverse and complex cur-
riculum area (Jackson, 2004).
Following an analysis of the more than 300 known defini-
tions of democracy associated with citizenship education,
David Kerr (2003) identifies a number of linked themes and
concepts that are common to citizenship education:
They include the themes of: the preservation of some-
thing, such as democratic society and its associated
rights; the notion of participation in society; the
preparation or capacity building of young people for
active and informed participation; a focus on inclusion
or integration into society; a concentration on contem-
porary society, the encouragement of partnerships;
and the promotion of an international perspective . . .
The definition also highlights a number of key con-
cepts that underpin citizenship education, including
democracy, rights, responsibilities, tolerance, respect,
equality, diversity and community . . . Citizenship edu-
cation also involves the dimensions of knowledge and
understanding, skills, attitudes and values. These
dimensions are brought together through teaching and
learning approaches, which have the primary goal of
shaping and changing the attitudes and behaviour of
young people through into their adult lives. The life-
blood of citizenship education is modern society and
discussion of the topical and sensitive issues it throws
up. Citizenship education enables consideration of
these issues, often set within an appropriate historical
framework, from a range of perspectives." (pp. 7-8,
italics added)
Portugal followed the recommendations of the Council of
Europe on education for democratic citizenship (Council of
Europe, 2002). The Council of Europe clearly referred to the
fact that it was a responsibility of present and future genera-
tions to maintain and safeguard democratic societies, and
that education had an important role in promoting the active
participation of all individuals in political, civic, social, and
cultural life. Thus, education for democratic citizenship was
very important and should be implemented in all member
states. It was declared that
education for democratic citizenship should be seen
as embracing any formal, nonformal or informal
educational activity, including that of the family,
enabling an individual to act throughout his or her
life as an active and responsible citizen respectful
of the rights of others;
education for democratic citizenship should be con-
sidered a factor for social cohesion, mutual under-
standing, intercultural and interreligious dialogue,
and solidarity, that it contributed to promoting the
principle of equality between men and women, and
that it encouraged the establishment of harmonious
and peaceful relations within and among peoples,
as well as the defense and development of demo-
cratic society and culture; and
education for democratic citizenship, in its broadest
possible sense, should be at the heart of the reform
and implementation of educational policies.
Following this and other important recommendations, the
Portuguese Ministry of Education published in 2006 the
"Strategic goals and recommendations for an action plan of
Citizenship Education" (http://sitio.dgidc.minedu.pt/cidada-
nia/Documents/FECidadaniaSP.pdf). It refers the need to
offer all students a common base of knowledge, attitudes,
and values through an accurate education for rights and
responsibilities in an educational perspective for global citi-
zenship that allows the following:
contribution to students' personal and social develop-
ment based on diversified experiences of demo-
cratic life;
students' development as active members of society
able to eliminate the social mechanisms that build
and reproduce inequality and discrimination, as
well as able to value diversity as a way of human
enrichment; and
students' awareness of their responsibility as members
of society, encouraging participation, coresponsi-
bility, and compromise in the building as world,
where freedom, justice, and solidarity really exist.
This is particularly important when considering the
changes Portuguese society has been going through in what
concerns its multicultural dimension. And of course, schools
Esteves 3
are an expression of these changes, as it will be addressed in
the next chapter.
Multicultural Dimension of Portuguese
Schools--Recent Changes
Portugal was for many centuries a country of emigrants, but
recently this situation has changed. In the last decades,
Portuguese society has been changing as a result of the
changing times--each year, more and more people from dif-
ferent countries, cultures, and religions have been arriving to
Portugal in the pursuit of work and a better life. Although
this situation is not new to Portugal that for many years has
received immigrants from PALP (Portuguese Speaking
African Countries) and Brazil, what makes this phenomena
challenging has been the arrival of many immigrants from
Eastern Europe.
The National Institute of Statistic recorded the following
values for immigrants in Portugal, in the last decade
(Table 1).
It is clear to perceive that the percentage of immigrants
has been growing in a fast rate practically doubling each
decade. The origin of the immigrants also changed as shown
in Figures 1 and 2, for the last 10 years:
It is clear that in 2000, it was still Africa the main supplier
of immigrants to Portugal (almost 47% of the total immi-
grants). The majority of this African immigrants arrived
from the PALP (a total of 95% of African immigration to
Portugal), as Table 2 shows.
During the decade of 2000, these figures started to change
and presently Europe is the main supplier of immigrants who
arrive in Portugal. Figure 2 shows the shift from a strong
African immigration to an unprecedented number of
European immigrants arriving in Portugal.
The majority of these European immigrants arrived from
several destinations, especially from Easter Europe as
Figure 3 shows.
Immigration from Eastern European countries is now
almost 70% of European immigration. It is important not to
forget the percentage of immigrants arriving from Central
and South America, the relative value of which has increased
since 2000 (about 12% of the immigration total and in 2008
reaching more than 25% of the immigrants arriving in
Portugal). These immigrants are mainly from Brazil (95% of
immigrants originating from South America in 2000 and
81% in 2008).
This changing pattern of immigration presents many chal-
lenges to both state and society. This flow of immigrants to
Southern Europe has made the Mediterranean region more
complex and created many new problems. The nature of
immigration since the 1990s is a remarkable mix of nation-
alities and skills (Baldwin-Edwards, 2004).
But it is not only society that has had to face these recent
changes: The educational system has also felt the need to
adapt to this new Portuguese reality. School is becoming a
mix of nationalities and cultures. If society is increasingly
multicultural, Portuguese schools include, nowadays, a
young population of different cultural origins. The school
has more than ever before an importance in recognizing the
multiculturalism of school attendants. It is necessary to take
in consideration this dimension in such a way that all the dif-
ferences are respected and still school prepares its students to
life in society (Bernardo, 2007).
The integration of migrants, refugees, asylum seekers,
and minorities in the Portuguese education system follows
the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and, particularly, the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child36 (Article 2, n.1), which is applied inde-
pendent of the child's legal status. The national legislation
and the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic (Articles 13,
15, 73, and 74) bestow rights of equal treatment in access to
education and teaching, independent of race, language, terri-
tory of origin, or religion. In these terms, any child (exiled,

refugee, or parented by irregular immigrants) has a right to
education and social service (Dias, 2005).
Portuguese legislation also accommodates the recogni-
tion of qualifications held by foreign students who may wish
to enter the national education system, rendering them
equivalent to current Portuguese qualification certificates or
other diplomas. Applications are analyzed by the Ministry of
Education according to a table that contemplates 25 coun-
tries. A Support Office for the Recognition of Qualifications
and Competencies is maintained by the ACIME (High
Commission for Immigration and Ethnic Minorities) for this
specific purpose.
Immigrant, refugee, or asylum-seeker students who enter
the Portuguese education system benefit from pedagogic
support which is both adequate to their situation and compat-
ible with the resources available to their new school. The
support measure ought to be focused on the removal of all
that hinders the students' progress and the creation of spe-
cific activities for the learning of Portuguese as a second lan-
guage, whenever they prove necessary. Schools should also
perform a diagnostic assessment of the pupil, followed of an
individual educational support plan (Dias, 2005).
According to a Ministry of Education report (Direcção
Geral da Educação [DGIDC], 2005), Portuguese schools
were attended by students of 120 nationalities, which have a
total of 80 languages as their mother tongue. This report
intended to characterize the situation of the students whose
mother tongue is not Portuguese and reached some interest-
ing conclusions:
Although students from Angola and Cape Verde are in
the top of the countries of origin of the students who
were not born in Portugal or whose parent's mother
tongue was not Portuguese, Brazil and Ukraine
are now in third and fourth position, between
2001/2002 and 2004/2005. The percentage of Bra-
zilian students represented 8.2%, while the percent-
age of Ukrainian students had increased to 8%.
According to the data of the study, which involved
more than 15,000 students, countries such as Bra-
zil, Ukraine, France, Moldavia, Germany, and
Switzerland had a growing number of students in
Portuguese schools, while others were in low num-
bers such as Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé
e Príncipe, and India, in what concerns students
whose mother tongue was not Portuguese.
Among the 80 languages spoken by students at home,
the "crioulo" languages spoken in PALP countries
are the most common, followed by Ukrainian. The
majority of the students speak Portuguese in school
with teachers and peers, but 5% communicates with
their peers in "crioulo."
There is also a relation between school achievement
and nationality.Among the best succeeded students,
there are nationalities such as Moldavia, Switzer-
land, Germany, Romania, and Ukraine.
In what concerns the understanding of school subjects,
in a scale of four (ranging from "good," "satisfac-
tory," "not satisfactory," to "don't understand any-
thing") 40.6% of the students got a "satisfactory"
and 30% reached "good." Yet, one in each four
students shows great difficulties in the mastering
of Portuguese language and almost 5% considered
"don't understand anything" in what the use of Por-
tuguese language is concerned.
In what concerns school achievement, 60% of students
whose mother language is not Portuguese manages
to get a satisfactory level, and the remaining 40%
refer in equal parts to very good levels of achieve-
ment and negative achievement.
The fact that students enter the system without testing for
Portuguese language skills has given rise to some criticism.
In fact, immigrant students are integrated in schools without
having actually developed the learning skills necessary to
cope with the curricula. It was exactly this situation that led
to the implementation of a program of integration of stu-
dents whose mother tongue was not Portuguese, in 2005, by
the Ministry of Education.
Having presented the situation in terms of nationality and
cultural diversity of Portuguese schools, it is important to
refer how the school system has been trying to overcome all
the challenges of multicultural schools. If much has been
done in terms of educational policy, a lot remains in the

hands of those who contact directly with students--the
teachers. And if in some school subjects it is difficult to
approach the item of living in a multicultural society and
school, in school geography this item is an important cur-
ricular part of the school subject.
Thus, geography gives an important contribution in terms
of discussing these new situations which are a reality of
Portuguese classrooms. In the following chapter, a study
involving geography teachers will be presented--It was
important to know their views and practices in citizenship
education; considering Portuguese multicultural school,
school geography is even more relevant in what concerns
dealing with differences in terms of language, culture, reli-
gion, and other aspects.
School Geography and Citizenship
Education--Recent Approaches in
Compulsory School
Due to the growing ethnic, cultural, racial, language, and
religious diversity in Europe and throughout the world, citi-
zenship education needs to be reviewed to prepare students
to function effectively in the 21st century. Citizens in this
century need the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary
to operate in their cultural communities and beyond their
cultural borders (Banks, 2003).
The role of school has never been so important in helping
students to develop, not only thoughtful and clarified identi-
fications with their cultural communities and their nation-
states but also clarified global identifications and deep
understanding of their roles in the world community.
According to DeJaeghere (2009), schools should be talking
about critical citizenship pedagogical approaches that bring
coherency to other approaches found in different forms of
education and apply them to the purposes of citizenship edu-
cation in multicultural societies.
These approaches are summarized by the author in four
main areas:
1. including marginalized knowledge and voices in
the curriculum to allow for the construction of
alternative forms of citizenship, and seeing this
knowledge in relation to, and as a critique of, main-
stream constructions of citizenship and democracy;
2. learning and enacting double-consciousness,
which is examining one's perspectives about and
identity related to citizenship through the eyes of
another (self-awareness and awareness of others'
perspectives) and understanding the complexities
of citizen identity affected by discrimination and
oppression;
3. developing intercultural understanding through
intercultural learning experiences to engage others
in civic relations and spaces; and
4. utilizing strategies for collective social action, such
as a collaborative engagement of students, teachers,
schools, and communities to create social change.
So, how can school geography do its part?
The International Declaration on Geographical Education
for Cultural Diversity (International Geographical Union
[IGU], 2000) considers in its preamble that school geogra-
phy is committed in the world effort to enhance the ability of
all citizens to contribute to creating a just, sustainable, and
pleasant world for all. In fact, the nature of geography educa-
tion has specificities that make this school subject a major
contributor in overcoming some of the bias that arise in a
multicultural society and of course in multicultural school
systems.
In fact, geography education offers foundations for peo-
ple of the world to develop
·
· the ability to be sensitive toward and defend human
rights;
·
· an ability to understand, accept, and appreciate cul-
tural diversity;
·
· an ability to understand empathies and critique
alternative viewpoints about people and their social
conditions;
·
· a willingness to be aware of the impact of their own
lifestyles on their local and broader social contexts;
·
· an appreciation of the urgent need to protect our
environment and bring about environmental justice
to local communities and regions that have experi-
enced environmental devastation; and
·
· an ability to act as an informed and active member
of their own and the global society.
Portuguese National Curriculum (Department of Basic
Education [DEB], 2001) doesn't have a specific discipline to
address citizenship education and so, this task has been
attributed to the several curriculum subjects. Some guiding
lines are presented in terms of what dimensions school sub-
jects should address in the formation of a conscientious citi-
zenship:
creation and development of a personal and social
identity;
participation in civic life showing responsibility, soli-
darity, and a critical attitude;
respect and valorization of individual and group
diversity in what concerns their communities and
choices;
development of an ecological awareness leading to the
valorization and preservation of the natural and cul-
tural heritage; and
valorization of the relational dimension of learning
and the ethical principles that regulate the relation
with knowledge and the others.
6 SAGE Open
In view of these recent concerns, school geography in
Portugal was reorganized in terms of contents and compe-
tences (DEB, 2002). It assumes its vocation in terms of giv-
ing a fundamental contribution to citizenship education. The
concept of the "geographical competent citizen" is intro-
duced and defined as "the one that has spatial skills, having
the ability to view spatially phenomena, interconnecting
them, and understand their territorial patterns, use different
scales of approach, and understand territorial, cultural and
individual identity."
Considering that the teaching of the subject should be
centered in the interpretative dimension of several educa-
tional experiences and not in the theoretical contents of
geography, school geography is organized in six broad
themes that should be developed in compulsory school:
The Earth: How to study it and represent it;
Natural environments;
Population and its patterns;
Economical activities;
Development contrasts; and
Environment and society.
In each theme, teachers should create learning experi-
ences that allow the development of general competences
and also specific geography competences: location, knowl-
edge about places, and dynamisms of the interrelations
among places. So, what does learning geography mean?
According to the International Declaration on Geo-
graphical Education for Cultural Diversity (IGU, 2000),
geography plays a major role in identifying cultural diversity
of people around the world and their potential communality
of Earth through the study of place, space, territory, natural
resources, and people's livelihoods. In so doing, geography
acts as an important "bridge" between the physical and social
sciences. Geographers have a long history of significant
contributions to decision making at local, regional, and
global scales for a variety of issues, including resources
management, health, environmental assessment, transporta-
tion, climate changes, and hazard management. Because
humanity's common concern at the start of the 21st century
is about its natural and human-created environment, geogra-
phy's main contribution to the future of the planet now lies in
its pedagogical and scientific efforts to explicate further our
understanding of spatial aspects of the human­nature
interface.
This contribution to the understanding of the world also
implies civic education--Through geography, students are
encouraged to explore and develop knowledge and under-
standing, skills, and attitudes and values. In terms of knowl-
edge and understanding, one of the most relevant issues is
the diversity of peoples and societies on Earth to appreciate
the cultural richness of humanity. In terms of skills, students
develop the ability to use communication, thinking, practical
and social competencies to explore geographical topics at a
range of scales from local to international. And in terms of
values, students develop the capacity to understand their sur-
roundings and the variety of natural and human characteris-
tics on the surface of the Earth as well as learn to respect the
rights of different social groups.
School geography in Portugal pursues all these goals, and
its educational relevance increases when considering diver-
sity issues not only in a regional or national scale but also in
a local scale, in the classroom, in the school. Geography
deals with issues closely related to citizenship, multicultural-
ism, among others. These issues are very important nowa-
days, and geography allows a multidisciplinary and global
vision of the world events. Even in what concerns globaliza-
tion, school geography bases its analyses in the understand-
ing of other cultures, in intercultural and economic changes,
and in changes in general (Cachinho, 2000).
In the next section, geography teachers share their consid-
erations about these issues and explain how geography
themes adapt to dealing with aspects of multiculturalism,
citizenship education, and other important questions. More
important, how do geography teachers view their roles as
citizenship educators through geography in their multicul-
tural classes.
GeographyTeachers Perceptions on
Citizenship Education--The Importance of
theTerritorial Dimension
These data are part of a broader research concerning school
geography in Portugal, teachers training and concerns, reor-
ganization of the school subject, and the role of geography
in the national curriculum. About 200 geography teachers
participated in this research explaining how they have
adapted in the last decades to changes in the national cur-
riculum in general and in the particular subject they teach--
geography.
The first thing teachers were asked was, considering the
main themes of school geography, which ones adapt better to
allowing approaches related to citizenship education in their
classrooms. The Figure 4 shows that this is a cross-curricular
theme in geography, but there are two themes that presented
themselves as particularly relevant to this kind of approach.
The themes are presented in the order they are taught during
the last 3 years of compulsory school (at least till 2009,
because now compulsory school has 3 more years, but that's
another issue).
It is important to refer that teachers were also asked
about the themes that are most interesting in developing
issues about sustainable development and environmental
education, but for the purpose of this presentation, we will
focus on the themes that most adapt to citizenship educa-
tion issues. The graph shows two main themes for this pur-
pose--"population and its patterns" and "developments
contrasts."
Esteves 7
We will focus on the theme related to population and its
patterns to understand the kind of learning students can do.
The study of this theme implies developing learning experi-
ences related to
·
· Population
­ Distribution and factors
­E
volution of the population and demographic
variables
·
· Mobility
­ Types of migrations
­ Migratory fluxes
­ Causes and consequences of migrations
·
· Cultural diversity
­ F
actors of identity and differentiation of popula-
tions
·
· Urbanized areas
­ Urbanization and rural areas
­ Urban areas' structure
­ Urban and rural ways of life
In geography research, some of the findings have already
proved the need to approach these items within a territorial
context. Issues like cultural diversity need a territorial basis
of analyses which provides different types of learning. One
thing is talking about cultural diversity in the world, in
Europe, in the city, or even in the neighborhood; another is
approaching these issues in a des-territorialized context (as
it is done many times in citizenship education).
Close approaches are more connected to students' expe-
riences, feelings, and emotions, and at this local level of
analyses, certain issues can have the effect of challenging
students' reflections and critical thinking about their own
beliefs. The analysis of some phenomena at a regional level
may also be interesting to develop a wider awareness of
cultural issues. And making the same study at the global
level will certainly give another understanding of the cul-
tural diversity issue.
So, how can teachers manage all these approaches in the
geography class? Giving students the possibility to range
from these different levels of analyses enables them to grow
from "their own experience"­based perceptions to a wider
comprehension of the phenomena. This means involving stu-
dents in problem-based activities, many times arising from
their own experience. The development of a geographical
literacy can be based in memorization of isolated geographi-
cal facts. Students live in a multidimensional world and
become aware of it in many contexts. It is the daily relation-
ship with the environment that helps shaping knowledge and
understanding of space.
The multicultural dimension of the classrooms can be an
important asset for teachers when approaching population
and diversity issues. And through geography, it is possible
to do these multiscale analyses to show that oftentimes
local issues are a consequence of global ones. Or, on the
contrary, students may perceive that those global issues
have local impacts that reflect in their existence and
perceptions.
The most important contribution of geography is, by set-
ting a territory of analyses, with its physical or imaginary
borders, it is clearer to approach certain issues. When asked
about the importance of citizenship education, which is a
concern for geography teachers, many referred to values
and attitudes, but the majority considered that these should
be worked within a context that helped to clarify the ques-
tions in discussion. And it was clear that some teachers give
more importance to a local level of analyses of problems
whereas others consider that the regional and global dimen-
sion can never be forgotten to understand the dynamics and
interrelations of natural and social issues (Figure 5).

The analyses of teachers' perceptions about their role in
addressing issues of citizenship education showed that there
are six main areas that are considered fundamental:
the development of values, attitudes, and social com-
petences;
the formation in terms of knowledge about their rights
and duties as members of society;
respect for others and the environment, know himself
or herself;
formation of the individual conscientious of the world
they live in, active and participative in society;
formation of the individual in terms of his or her inte-
gration in various communities; and
the idea that citizenship education implies some kind
of membership that can range from community
level to global level.
Comparing those with Kerr's (2003) themes that involve
citizenship education, Portuguese geography teachers share
this common idea of contribution to the integration of stu-
dents in their communities and have an active and construc-
tive participation in them:
Preservation of something: In geography, the idea of a
sustainable world is very connected to the theme of
development and social issues;
Notion of participation: In geography, students
develop competences related to problem solving
and decision making about social, economical, and
environmental issues;
Focus on inclusion or integration: In geography,
through the learning of different places, societies,
and problems, students learn to respect differences
in a plural society, and are sensible to the existence
of different cultures and worry how they relate and
interconnect;
Promotion of an international perspective: Geogra-
phy education helps in developing awareness about
the main problems of the world, and develops the
notion of geographical diversity and the ability to
search for strategies that lead to the possible solu-
tion of common problems;
Key concepts: Through geography education, it is pos-
sible to clarify many key concepts (knowledge and
understanding, skills, attitudes, and values) as geog-
raphy deals with real problems of the real world.
By giving all these approaches a territorial dimension,
geography education allows the approach of issues of diver-
sity, conflicts, integration, or any other in a real context that
can be very effective in terms of developing critical analyses
competences. That may be the most important contribution
of geography education to tearing down walls.
Final Reflections About Urban Geography
Contribution to Citizenship Education
In the previous sections we tried to demonstrate how
Portuguese society is more than ever a multicultural one,
and how it reflects in the complexity of our schools and how
it was necessary to develop different approaches to help
students understand this diversity and adapt to it. The par-
ticular case of school geography was referred, an example of
a school subject that has taken the lead in many projects and
studies related to citizenship education.
The themes explored by the school subject are particu-
larly relevant in studies about social and economical prob-
lems of our societies and their impact in the territorial. It
was also mentioned that it is exactly this possibility of con-
ducting studies at different scales that gives geography its
importance in terms of approaching issues of human and
social development. We would like to refer to the impor-
tance that urban studies have been gaining in specific areas
of study of many global issues.
According to Cabigon (2008), understanding the nature of
cities in globalization is essential knowledge. In fact, cities all
share common traits (e.g., a market-oriented nature). They
also hold a potential for dualism (promise: wealth, innova-
tion, and social change; and trouble: prostitution, poverty,
crime, and pollution, among many others). Cities are very
important both globally and locally. They are the center of
trade, commercial establishments, business firms, advanced
culture, and technology. They are the destinations of immi-
grants hoping and searching for employment. Cities represent
the most often used and influential places in the world.
This means that our success and survival in the world
today and tomorrow depends on the knowledge we have
about cities. Cities are particularly challenging entities to
understand. Equally important is that they are constantly
evolving, impacting on our lives and the lives of others.
Geographers have always been interested in cities as they
sometimes reflect many events that happen at a different
scale, and reproduce many of the issues that also appear at
different scales. Being a close reality for Portuguese stu-
dents, what happens in the city may be a good place of study
to understand most complex phenomena.
The importance of the city as the living place of a great
part of humanity in the 21st century was celebrated in 2010
in the Expo in Shanghai, titled, "Better World Better Life."
Urban inequality in the cities always has a social and territo-
rial expression.And these inequalities can have serious polit-
ical repercussions. The UN Report State of the Cities
2008/2009 clearly refers to the danger of social inequality in
the cities (UN-HABITAT, 2008):
Social and economic inequalities can awaken a host
of negative sentiments among the poor and dispos-
sessed and lead to mass action, or worse, civil strife,

either because disparities are not acknowledged and
thus not remedied, or because corrective measures
such as laws and redistribution policies attempt
to entrench the status quo or seek to placate those
mired in a highly unequal system and
Inequalities can also reduce the base of social and
political support for fundamental structural reforms
necessary to embark on a path of high growth with
more equity.
The discourse about the city could easily be the discourse
about the world's inequalities and this is why geographers
give a special attention to the city when creating citizenship
education activities. In her research, Soenen (2002) presents
a study on community development in urban environments
undertaken in multiethnic schools in Flanders. The main
purpose was to research changes in schools and use the com-
plexity and diversity of the city to build social integration
and a sense of community. Some of the conclusions of the
study reinforce the importance of the city approach in deal-
ing with multicultural integration issues.
The movement of educational cities has been drawing
educators' attention since 1990 to the fact that the city pro-
vides the best material conditions from which to forge a gen-
eral offer of diffusion of the learning and the knowledge
needed for life in society and, at the same time, can create the
greatest range of inequalities in its distribution. The city is a
shopwindow filled with an array of offers and possibilities
waiting to be chosen, but very often, they are not taken
advantage of, or else there is an unequal distribution of the
freedom to do so (International Association of Educating
Cities, 1990).
In its Charter of Educating Cities, it is stated that diversity
is inherent in the modern city and the notion is that it will
increase even more in the future. Accordingly, one of the
challenges facing the educating city is to foster a balance and
harmony between identity and diversity, taking into account
the contributions of the communities of which the city is
comprised and the rights of all those living in the city to feel
that their own cultural identity is being recognized.
And these are important reasons why to approach human
diversity in school geography at the local scale is very impor-
tant to help students grasp the real impact of their imaginary
borders in the place they live in. Because "borders" are real
and their impact is visible in the living space of cities. And it
is by fighting the closest ones that maybe distant ones will
fade away.
