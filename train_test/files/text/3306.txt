Introduction
Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is the major water channel in the
renal proximal tubule and the loop of Henle.1 These two
nephron segments are responsible for reabsorbing 80% of
the glomerular filtrate.1 As renal proximal tubular cells
(RPTCs) reabsorb 60­70% of filtered sodium (Na) and
fluid, changes in the way in which RPTCs reabsorb water
(i.e. AQP1) and Na (via increased Na transporter expres-
sion)2 can have profound effects on renal and body fluid
balance. AQP1-deficient mice (Aqp1-null) displayed

Abstract
Introduction: We aimed to examine the regulation of aquaporin 1 expression in an angiotensinogen transgenic mouse
model, focusing on underlying mechanisms.
Methods: Male transgenic mice overexpressing rat angiotensinogen in their renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) and
rat immortalised RPTCs stably transfected with rat angiotensinogen cDNA were used.
Results: Angiotensinogen-transgenic mice developed hypertension and nephropathy, changes that were either
partially or completely attenuated by treatment with losartan or dual renin­angiotensin system blockade (losartan and
perindopril), respectively, while hydralazine prevented hypertension but not nephropathy. Decreased expression of
aquaporin 1 and heme oxygenase-1 and increased expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and
sodium­hydrogen exchanger 3 were observed in RPTCs of angiotensinogen-transgenic mice and in angiotensinogen-
transfected immortalised RPTCs. These parameters were normalised by dual renin­angiotensin system blockade. Both
in vivo and in vitro studies identified a novel mechanism in which angiotensinogen overexpression in RPTCs enhances
the cytosolic accumulation of Nrf2 via the phosphorylation of pGSK3 Y216. Consequently, lower intranuclear Nrf2
levels are less efficient to trigger heme oxygenase-1 expression as a defence mechanism, which subsequently diminishes
aquaporin 1 expression in RPTCs.
Conclusions: Angiotensinogen-mediated downregulation of aquaporin 1 and Nrf2 signalling may play an important role
in intrarenal renin­angiotensin system-induced hypertension and kidney injury.

normal phenotypes with respect to survival, physical
appearance and organ morphology, but these mice became
severely dehydrated after water deprivation, indicating
that AQP1 is required for the formation of a concentrated
urine.3 Aqp1-null mice had a relatively low blood pressure
phenotype, which can be explained by several possibilities
­ e.g. polyuria,4 impaired nitric oxide signalling5 and
reduced renin cell recruitment.6
It has been observed that AQP1 expression is upregu-
lated in the kidneys7 and brain8 of spontaneously hyperten-
sive rats.7,8 In contrast, recent studies reported that renal
and cardiac AQP1 expression was downregulated and
associated with renal fibrosis9 and high-salt diet-induced
hypertension.10 Thus, it remains unclear whether AQP1
expression can directly or indirectly affect blood pressure
and kidney injury.
The intrarenal renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a
key role in blood pressure regulation and renal haemody-
namics, and all RAS components are expressed in
RPTCs.11 To date, intrarenal RAS influences on AQP1
expression in either pathological or physiological condi-
tions are poorly understood. Bouley et al. reported that
angiotensin II (Ang II) rather than osmolality may be
more important in regulating AQP1 levels in renal proxi-
mal tubules (RPTs).12 Ang II at low concentrations (10­9
and 10­8 M) or infusion of Ang II at 80 ng/min/kg
increased AQP1 expression in cultured rat immortalised
renal proximal tubular cells (IRPTCs) in vitro and in rat
kidneys in vivo, respectively. In contrast, Ang II at high
concentration (10­7 M) inhibited AQP1 expression in
IRPTCs. Thus, the intrarenal RAS appears to regulate
AQP1 expression, influencing water reabsorption and
body fluid homeostasis.
Our lab has established that transgenic mice specifi-
cally overexpressing angiotensinogen (the sole precursor
of all angiotensins) in their RPTCs developed hyperten-
sion and nephropathy with elevated intrarenal reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production.13­15 In the present
study, we aimed to determine whether intrarenal RAS-
induced hypertension and kidney injury in our angio-
tensinogen-transgenic (Agt-Tg) mice could be mediated,
at least in part, via alteration of AQP1 expression and
whether RAS blockade in this transgenic model could
reverse this effect. We further aimed to define the underly-
ing molecular mechanisms both in vivo and in vitro.
Materials and methods
Animal models and ethics statement
Agt-Tg mice overexpressing renal rat angiotensinogen
were generated by employing the kidney-specific, andro-
gen-regulated protein promoter (KAP2) linked to rat
angiotensinogen cDNA as reported previously.16 There
is no need to administer exogenous androgen since the
circulating level of testosterone in adult male Agt-Tg
mice (from 12 weeks of age, as is the case here) is suffi-
ciently high to drive KAP2 promoter to express the
transgenes.13,14,16 Thus, male Agt-Tg mice were employed
and studied starting at 10 weeks of age and treated with or
without hydralazine (15 mg/kg/day, in drinking water),
losartan (losartan 30 mg/kg/day, in drinking water) and/or
dual RAS blockers (losartan 30 mg/kg/ day plus perindo-
pril 4 mg/kg/ day, in drinking water) from week 13 until
week 2013­15 (eight to 15 mice per group). Non-transgenic
littermates served as controls. All animals had free access
to standard mouse chow (Diet #2918, Harlan Teklad,
Montreal, Canada) and water.
The animal study was carried out under strict condi-
tions according to the recommendations in the guide for
the case and use of laboratory animals of the National
Institutions of Health. Animal care and procedures were
approved by the animal care committee from the Centre de
Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de
Montréal (CRCHUM). Mice were killed by sodium pento-
barbital overdose (75 mg/kg of body weight (BW)) and
efforts were made to minimise suffering.
Physiological studies
Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored by the
tail-cuff method with the Visitech BP-2000 blood pressure
analysis system for mice (Visitech System Inc., Apex, NC,
USA), as reported elsewhere.13­15 Animals in each group
were acclimated to longitudinal SBPmeasurement (2-week
period of pre-training starting at 11 weeks of age, followed
by actual measurement of SBP thrice weekly from 13
weeks until 20 weeks of age) to minimise stress to the ani-
mals. While the technique of tail-cuff measurement is gen-
erally considered less sensitive than telemetry, our SBP
data include a 2-week pre-study training period and sub-
stantial numbers of animals (N=8­15 mice per group) and
longitudinal measurement (8 weeks excluding the 2-week
pre-study training period).
Twenty-four hours before the mice were killed, BW
was recorded and mice were individually housed for 24
hours in metabolic cages. Blood was collected individually
via intracardiac exsanguination before death and then cen-
trifuged to obtain serum. Urine was collected and assayed
for albumin and creatinine ratio (g/mg) (enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Albuwell and Creatinine
Companion, Exocell, Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA), angio-
tensinogen and Ang II measurement (i.e. C18 Sep-Pak col-
umns (Waters, Mississauga, ON, Canada); extraction kits
(BachemAmericas, Torrance, CA, USA); ELISAs (Bachem
Americas)) as reported previously.13­15 Kidney weights
were rapidly recorded. The left kidney was utilised for
renal histology and the right kidney was reserved for RPTs
isolation by the Percoll gradient method for protein expres-
sion experiments as previously reported.13­15

Renal morphology, immunohistochemistry and
immunofluorescence
The renal morphology and immunostaining (immunohis-
tochemistry and immunofluorescence) were performed as
described previously.14,16 Briefly, the kidney morphology
was studied with periodic-acid Schiff (PAS) and Masson's
trichrome staining. The antibodies were used for immuno-
histochemistry and immunofluorescence including: anti-
AQP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA);
anti-nuclear factor-erythroid 2p45 (NF-E2) related fac-
tor-2 (Nrf2) and anti-kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1
(Keap1) antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA); anti-
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor,
MI, USA); anti-catalase (Cat) and anti--actin antibodies
(Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada); anti-collagen
type IV (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA);
anti-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (27C10) and
anti-phospho-GSK3 (Ser 9) (pGSK S9, an inactive form)
(5B3) as well as anti-histone H3 (3H1) antibodies (Cell
Signaling, Boston, MA, USA); anti-TGF1 and anti--
catenin (total) antibodies (R&D Systems, Inc., Burlington,
ON, Canada); anti-GSK3 (pY216, an active form) (BD
Transduction Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada);
anti-phospho--catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling,
ON, Canada); anti-phospho--catenin (Ser552) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). The sodium­hydro-
gen exchanger 3 (NHE3) antibody was a gift from Dr
Orson Moe (University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center, Dallas, TX, USA). A rabbit polyclonal antibody
against rAgt was generated in our laboratory17 and is spe-
cific for intact rat and mouse angiotensinogen (55­62 kDa)
and does not cross-react with pituitary hormone prepara-
tions or other rat or mouse plasma proteins, as described
elsewhere.13­15
Rat immortalised renal proximal tubular cells
The IRPTC cell line11,18 and an IRPTC stable clone that
has been stably transfected with the control plasmid pRC/
RSV (designated as `pRSV-IRPTC') or with a plasmid
pRC/RSV containing the rat angiotensinogen cDNA (des-
ignated as `pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC')13,19 were employed for
our in vitro studies. We have previously reported that as
compared to naive IRPTC and pRSV-IRPTC, pRSV/rAgt-
IRPTC express significantly high amounts of rat angio-
tensinogen mRNA and protein as well as significantly
higher amounts of Ang II secreted into the culture
medium.13,19 All in vitro studies were performed in the nor-
mal 150 nM NaCl final concentration with an osmolarity
of 415 mOsm/kg in normal glucose (5 mM D-glucose)
DMEM as reported by Bouley et al.12
Nuclear protein and cytosolic protein extracts were pre-
pared using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extrac-
tion kit (Thermo Scientific, Burlington, ON, Canada).18
Cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP, an activator of HO-1 expres-
sion) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada
(Oakville, ON, Canada).
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance between the experimental groups
was analysed by one-way analysis of variance, followed
by the Bonferroni test using Graphpad Software, Prism
5.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA, http://www.graphpad.com/
prism/Prism.htm). A probability level of P0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant and was fol-
lowed by a Bonferroni analysis with adjustment for mul-
tiple comparisons.13­15
Results
Physiological parameters
We measured biological parameters in five subgroups of
animals at the age of 20 weeks ­ non-transgenic littermates
as controls (Con, N=12); Agt-Tg (N=14); Agt-Tg + RAS
blockade (losartan and perindopril treatment, Agt-Tg +
L/P, N=15); Agt-Tg + losartan (Agt-Tg + L, N=14) and
Agt-Tg + hydralazine (Agt-Tg + H, N=8) as shown in
Figure 1. There were no significant differences in BW, kid-
ney weight and the kidney weight/BW ratio (Figure 1(a))
among the five groups. However, as compared to the con-
trol group, SBP (Figure 1(a), a cross-sectional measure-
ment at week 20; Figure 1(b), a longitudinal measurement
(weeks 13­20)), urinary albumin/creatine ratio (ACR, g/
mg) (Figure 1(c)), angiotensinogen/creatine ratio (ng/mg)
(Figure 1(d)) and Ang II/creatine ratio (ng/mg) (Figure
1(e)) were relatively increased in Agt-Tg mice; these
changes were prevented by the treatment of losartan alone
and/or dual RAS blockade in Agt-Tg mice. It appears that
dual RAS blockade was more effective than losartan alone
in decreasing the urinary ACR (Figure 1(c)). In contrast,
although hydralazine treatment was able to decrease SBP
in Agt-Tg mice over the follow-up period (Figure 1(a) and
(b)), the urinary ACR was unchanged (Figure 1(c)). The
serum level of angiotensinogen (Figure 1(e)) or Ang II
(Figure 1(f)) did not differ between the groups.
Renal morphology and extracellular matrix
protein
Both PAS staining (Figure 2(a)) and Masson's trichrome
staining (Figure 2(b)) of kidney sections revealed enhanced
extracellular matrix (ECM) protein accumulation in the
glomerulo-tubular areas in hypertensive Agt-Tg mice, a
finding that was confirmed by collagen type IV (Figure
2(c)) and TGF1-immunohistochemistry staining (Figure
2(d)). The degree of oxidative stress was confirmed by
lower catalase expression in kidneys of hypertensive
4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
angiotensinogen mice (Figure 2(e)). Semi-quantitative
analysis revealed that dual RAS blockade was more effec-
tive in preventing ECM accumulation and collagen type
IV/TGF-1 expression as well as in normalising catalase
expression in Agt-Tg mice as compared to losartan treat-
ment alone. Given the greater effectiveness of dual block-
ade, the remainder of our mechanistic experiments were
done with Agt-Tg mice treated with dual RAS blockade.
Renal angiotensinogen, AQP1 and HO-1
protein expression
We assessed angiotensinogen, AQP1 and HO-1 protein
expression in the renal cortex by immunohistochemistry
(Figure 3(a)) and in isolated RPTs by western blot (WB)
(Figure 3(b)). AQP1 shows a two-band WB pattern (gly-
cosylated (38 kDa) and non-glycosylated AQP1 frac-
tions (28 kDa)), matching its original described character
as an N-proteoglycan.20 The functional significance of
AQP1 glycosylation is unknown but it could play a role
in AQP1 oligomerisation,21 removal of sugars from the
AQP1 molecule seems not to influence AQP1 water
transport function.22 Thus, in the current study, we eval-
uated the change of total AQP1 including both glyco-
sylated and non-glycosylated AQP1. Compared to
non-transgenic control littermates, increased angio-
tensinogen, but decreased AQP1 and HO-1 protein
expression were observed in RPTs of Agt-Tg mice and
these changes were normalised with dual RAS blockade.
These data indicate an inverse relationship between
angiotensinogen expression and AQP1 and HO-1 expres-
sion in RPTs of Agt-Tg mice.
To establish a functional relationship among angio-
tensinogen, AQP1 and HO-1 expression, we performed
in vitro studies by using IRPTCs.11,18 In the presence of
CoPP, an activator of HO-1, both HO-1 and AQP1 pro-
tein expressions were increased (Figure 3(c)) while the
angiotensinogen protein expression was reduced (Figure
3(d)) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, these
effects seem selective because CoPP did not affect Nrf2
expression (Figure 3(e)). We further confirmed those
results in naive IRPTCs and IRPTCs transiently

the stimulation of 2 µM CoPP (Figure 3(f)).
Renal angiotensinogen, AQP1 and Nrf2-Keap1
expression
As compared to controls, there was augmented Nrf2 protein
expression in kidneys of both Agt-Tg and Agt-Tg mice
treated with dual RAS blockade (Figure 4(a)), and that
expression pattern was further confirmed in the fresh iso-
lated RPTs by WB (Figure 4(b)). However, higher magnifi-
cation of immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the
augmented Nrf2 was mostly localised to the cytosolic por-
tion in RPTCs of Agt-Tg mice with some Nrf2 staining in
the nuclei of RPTCs (Figure 4(a)). In contrast, in the kid-
neys of Agt-Tg mice treated with dual RAS blockade, the
majority of positive immunohistochemistry-Nrf2 was local-
ised in the nuclei of RPTCs (Figure 4(a)). Keap1, a protein
involved in Nrf2 degradation showed no change in expres-
sion in the kidneys among three groups by either immuno-
histochemistry staining (Figure 4(a)) or WB (Figure 4(b)).
Next, we validated the renal Nrf2 translocation pattern in
our pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants.13,19 As com-
pared with naive IRPTC and pRSV-IRPTC control transfor-
mants, the pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants
expressed high amounts of rat angiotensinogen and Nrf2
protein without any change in Keap1 protein expression
(Figure 5(a)). Also, AQP1 expression was dramatically sup-
pressed in the pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable clone (Figure 5(a)).
Similar to the in vivo observation, the higher and lower Nrf2
expression was observed in the cytosolic fraction and
nuclear fraction of pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants,
respectively, as compared to pRSV-IRPTC controls (Figure
5(b)). Moreover, the lower AQP1 expression pattern in the
pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable clone was further confirmed by
immunofluorescence-AQP1 staining (Figure 5(c)).

Y216 enhances Nrf2 nuclear export, we investigated the
expression of pGSK S9 and pGSK Y216 in vivo and in
vitro. As compared to control animals, the expression of
pGSK S9 was decreased whereas pGSK Y216 expression
was increased in the kidneys of Agt-Tg mice, and dual
RAS blockade treatment reversed these changes in Agt-Tg
mice (Figure 5(d)). The expression pattern of pGSK S9
and pGSK Y216 was further confirmed by WB in the fresh
isolated RPTs (Figure 5(e)). The similar expression pattern
of pGSK S9 and pGSK Y216 was also observed in our
pRSV-IRPTCs and pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transfor-
mants (Figure 6(a)).
Studies indicate that both Ang II and AQP1 can interact
with the GSK3 and -catenin pathways to trigger renal
injury. Thus, we studied these interactions in vitro. Our
data indicated that the phosphorylation of -catenin
(Ser33/37/Thr41 and Ser552) was significantly inhibited
in pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants as compared to
naive IRPTC and/or pRSV-IRPTC control transformants
(Figure 6(a)).
Renal angiotensinogen and NHE3
expression
Co-immunofluorescence staining of AQP1 and NHE3
revealed that Agt-Tg mice expressed less AQP1 protein
and augmented NHE3 protein in their RPTCs as com-
pared to control littermates and that the treatment with
dual RAS blockade reversed these changes (Figure
6(b)). These observations were further confirmed by
WB for AQP1 and NHE3 in isolated RPTs of these mice
(Figure 6(c)). The increased NHE3 expression was also

Discussion
The present report identifies novel mechanism(s) by which
angiotensinogen overexpression inhibits AQP1 expression
in RPTCs, resulting in renal injury and hypertension (see
our concept of a molecular model in Figure 7). In brief,
angiotensinogen overexpression in RPTCs enhances cyto-
solic accumulation of Nrf2 via the phosphorylation of
pGSK3 Y216. Consequently, less intranuclear Nrf2 is
available to trigger HO-1 expression as a defence mecha-
nism. As a result, AQP1 expression in RPTCs is subse-
quently diminished. The depleted AQP1 expression
through -catenin-dependent signalling further contributes
to hypertension that involves the intrarenal RAS (via
NHE3) and nephropathy.
In this study, we are focusing on the functional interac-
tion between angiotensinogen and AQP1 in RPTCs, given
the fact that Aqp1-null mice appear not to develop homeo-
stasis disturbances although they have slight dehydration.3
In concert with our previous findings,13­15 we observed
that Agt-Tg mice specifically overexpressing rat
angiotensinogen in their RPTCs developed hypertension
and nephropathy. As we only detected a significantly
increased urinary Agt/Cre ratio and Ang II/Cre ratio in
Agt-Tg mice, while serum levels of angiotensinogen and
Ang II remained unchanged, it suggests that angiotensino-
gen derived predominantly from RPTCs rather than other
sources23,24 plays the key role in this phenomenon.
The use of combination treatment with an ACE inhibi-
tor and angiotensin-receptor blocker to ameliorate the pro-
gression of kidney disease has been controversial because
of concern about an increased risk of hyperkalaemia or
acute kidney injury.25,26 However, a recent meta-analysis
published in the Lancet27 reported a benefit of dual RAS
blockade in the prevention of chronic kidney disease with
or without diabetes. Our current data lend support to these
observations. We found that as compared to the treatment
with losartan alone, dual RAS blockade (losartan and per-
indopril) was more effective in preventing hypertension
induced by activation of the intrarenal RAS and nephropa-
thy progression in Agt-Tg mice. Moreover, although
hydralazine decreased systemic hypertension in Agt-Tg
mice over the follow-up period, it had no impact on ACR
(a marker of renal function), suggesting that intrarenal
RAS activation contributed to the development of

nephropathy independent of systemic hypertension (and
possibly associated with elevated ROS production in
RPTCs in Agt-Tg mice, as reported previously).14
Both angiotensinogen and AQP1, which are mainly
expressed in RPTCs, are important for maintaining normal
fluid homeostasis; however, how they interact has not been
fully delineated; whether their interaction has a regulatory
role in the development of hypertension and nephropathy
remains elusive. Notably, substantial inhibition of AQP1
and HO-1 protein expression in the RPTCs was observed
in the kidney of Agt-Tg mice, implicating their possible
role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and nephropathy.
This possibility is supported by the observation that sig-
nificantly decreased renal AQP1 content was observed in
the obstructed kidneys of rats with unilateral ureteral
obstruction, suggesting that downregulation of AQP1
might be associated with tubule-interstitial fibrosis.9
Moreover, in the mouse model of hypertension induced by
a high-salt diet, the reduction of cardiac AQP1 might be
associated with hypertension and cardiac injury, because
angiotensin-receptor blocker treatment (valsartan) par-
tially reversed the effects of a high-salt diet on hyperten-
sion with cardiac damage (fibrosis and inflammatory cell
infiltration) and normalised cardiac AQP1 expression.10
Our in vitro studies demonstrated that CoPP, an activa-
tor of HO-1, dose-dependently stimulates HO-1 and AQP1
and inhibits angiotensinogen protein expression in
IRPTCs, suggesting an inverse relationship between the
expression of angiotensinogen and HO-1/AQP1 in RPTCs.
How HO-1 and AQP1 interact is not fully understood. A
possible link between AQP1 and HO-1 might be via the
Kruppel-like protein, since the AQP1 promoter contains
Kruppel-like sequences,28 and Kruppel-like factor 2
dependently induced HO-1 expression.29
HO-1 is a stress-inducible protein that induces cellular
protection in the event of injury, inflammation, oxidative
stress, etc. Exogenous induction of HO-1 has been shown
to have renal and/or cardiovascular protective func-
tions30,31 and to attenuate the development of hypertension
and to decrease blood pressure in models of established

hypertension.30,31 HO-1 expression is modulated by Nrf2,
a transcription factor that is highly expressed in the kid-
ney.32,33 It is thought that the Nrf2/Keap1-HO-1 defence
system is renoprotective and that its induction might even
improve kidney function.32,33 Thus, we tested the intrare-
nal expression pattern of Nrf2/Keap1 in our three groups
of animals.
By means of elevated ROS generation, Agt-Tg mice
displayed augmented RPTC Nrf2 accumulation, primarily
in the cytosol, with less nuclear staining, and this Nrf2
translocation pattern was further confirmed in our pRSV/
rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants. These data suggested
that while overexpression of angiotensinogen in RPTCs
resulted in activated Nrf2 expression, it still failed to pro-
mote sufficient HO-1 and AQP1 expression in RPTCs to
prevent or diminish ROS-induced kidney damage and
hypertension occurring in Agt-Tg mice. Compelling
studies suggested that Nrf2 accumulation/activation is
countered by two major Nrf2 degradation mechanisms ­
e.g. Keap1-induced Nrf2 proteasomal degradation in the
cytosol; and/or GSK3-mediated nuclear export and deg-
radation of Nrf2.32­36 As renal Keap1 expression did not
differ among the three groups of animals, Keap1-associated
Nrf2 degradation appears to be normal in our model. In
contrast, the activated GSK3 (i.e. pGSK Y216 phospho-
rylation)33,34,37 has been reported to phosphorylate Fyn
tyrosine kinase, leading to enhanced nuclear export of
Nrf2 and proteasomal degradation, probably via the adap-
tor protein -TrCP independent of Keap1.33,34,38,39 By con-
ducting both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we observed
that overexpression of angiotensinogen in RPTCs indeed
promoted and inhibited the phosphorylation of pGSK
Y216 (active form) and pGSK S9 (inactive form), respec-
tively. This suggests that the enhanced nuclear export of

Figure 7. Our working model. In brief, overexpression of
the intrarenal angiotensinogen gene in RPTCs via elevated
ROS generation mediates Nrf2 activation with an impaired
Nrf2 translocation pattern. Angiotensinogen overexpression
in RPTCs promotes and inhibits the phosphorylation of pGSK
Y216 (active form) and pGSK S9 (inactive form), respectively.
Consequently, nuclear export of Nrf2 activity is enhanced,
resulting in the accumulation of Nrf2 in the cytosol, and
decreased Nrf2 expression in nuclei, which fails to trigger
HO-1 expression as a defence mechanism and subsequently
diminishes AQP1 expression in RPTCs. Concomitantly, the
depleted AQP1 expression through -catenin-dependent
signalling further contributes to intrarenal RAS-induced
nephropathy and hypertension (via NHE3).
Nrf2 was associated with an accumulation of Nrf2 in the
cytosol, while lower nuclear levels of Nrf2 failed to trigger
HO-1/AQP1 induction-mediated renoprotection in RPTCs
in Agt-Tg mice.
Evidence suggests that -catenin might be one of medi-
ators that links AQP1 and Ang II functionally.40­42 For
example, AQP1 acts as a scaffold in interaction with
GSK3 to promote -catenin degradation by increasing
-catenin phosphorylation; vice versa, loss of AQP1 inhib-
its -catenin degradation and facilitates the translocation
of free -catenin to the nucleus to enhance Wnt signalling,
consequently triggering cystic dilation of RPTs in polycys-
tic kidney disease.42 In addition, Ang II via AT1R appears
to promote the accumulation of -catenin protein, corre-
lated with GSK3 phosphorylation, contributing to the
development of renal fibrosis and hypertension.40,41 In the
current study, we observed the depleted AQP1 in our
Agt-Tg and pRSV/rAgt-IRPTC stable transformants acti-
vated and inhibited phosphorylation of GSK3 (Y216) and
-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41 and Ser552), respectively, sug-
gesting that loss of AQP1 might trigger the Wnt/-catenin
pathway, resulting in RPTs damage and hypertension.
Finally, our data both in vivo and in vitro also suggest
that overexpression of angiotensinogen in RPTCs and the
related hypertension might be due to decreased water
absorption via AQP1 and increased sodium reabsorption
via NHE3. Indeed, this observation is in line with recent
findings ­ e.g. when compared with wild-type mice
(NHE3+/+), AQP1 is significantly increased in RPTCs of
NHE3 knockout mice (NHE3-/-), which completely blunted
Ang II-induced hypertension, underscoring the importance
ofAQP1 and NHE3 interaction.43 In fact,Ang II-dependent
hypertension mediated by an increased NHE3 abundance
in RPTCs has been reported in AT1a receptor-deficient
mice44­46 and in oxidative stress-modulated AT1R signal-
ling in Sprague­Dawley rats,47,48 although other Ang II
infusion models have provided variable results49­51 (NHE3
has been reported as increased50 or decreased49 or not
changed).51
In conclusion, our data suggest that angiotensinogen/
Nrf2-mediated downregulation ofAQP1 and HO-1 expres-
sion in the proximal tubule plays a key role in Ang
II-induced hypertension and kidney injury.
