Perceived Need and Help-Seeking in Adults
With Mood, Anxiety, or Substance Use Disorders
Ramin Mojtabai, MD, PhD; Mark Olfson, MD, MPH; David Mechanic, PhD
Background: A majority of adults with common men-
tal disorders do not seek professional help. To better un-
derstand why not, we examined the correlates of vari-
ous stages of help-seeking, including perceived need for
professional help, seeking such help, and from which pro-
fessionals participants sought help.
Methods: The sample for this study comprised 1792 par-
ticipants in the National Comorbidity Survey, con-
ducted from 1990-1992, who were diagnosed with a 12-
month DSM-III-R mood, anxiety, or substance disorder.
In this sample, we assessed correlates of perceived need
for professional help, seeking professional help among
those with a need, and, among those who did seek pro-
fessional help, seeking help from mental health profes-
sionals.
Results: Mood disorders, comorbid mood and anxiety
disorders, and mental disorders associated with impair-
ment in role functioning or suicidality were strong pre-
dictors of perceived need. Psychopathology was also as-
sociated with the decision to seek help from mental health
professionals, but not with the decision to seek profes-
sional help overall. After controlling for the nature and
severity of psychopathology, various sociodemographic
and attitudinal factors appeared to be associated with per-
ception of need, help-seeking, and participants' choices
of professionals.
Conclusions: Unmet need for mental health care is a se-
rious public health problem. Meeting this need requires
expanding our attention beyond psychopathology to vari-
ous evaluations and decisions that affect help-seeking.
Our results suggest the importance of attitude and be-
havior change strategies in reducing the gap between need
and care.

PSYCHIATRIC epidemiological
studies repeatedly find that
most adults with mental dis-
orders receive no treat-
ment.1,2 This finding poses a
conceptual problem concerning the rela-
tionship between disorder and need for
care and a public health problem concern-
ing the need to define and address psy-
chological, social, and economic barriers
to care. One commonly used descriptive
model,3 which explains service use in terms
of the combined effects of predisposing fac-
tors (eg, gender, education, and health be-
liefs), enabling factors (eg, income, insur-
ance, and geographic access), and severity
of illness, has only modest power to pre-
dict whether individuals with mental dis-
orders will seek help.4-6
Studies of illness identification and
help-seeking generally follow 2 different
streams. First, epidemiological surveys,
such as the Epidemiologic Catchment Ar-
eas study7 and National Comorbidity Sur-
vey (NCS),8 are based on large represen-
tative samples. They use structured
interviews to provide descriptive cross-
sections of how disorder, help-seeking, and
other factors are associated. In contrast,
qualitative studies are typically based on
limited samples but use more intensive as-
sessments with less standardized mea-
sures.9,10 These studies make clear that the
process of help-seeking has multiple
stages.9,11,12 Individuals experience symp-
toms; attempt to evaluate the signifi-
cance of their symptoms and the likely
consequences; determine whether they
have a problem that requires interven-
tion and could benefit from treatment;
evaluate the benefits and costs of various
treatments; and choose which health care
providers to consult. Different factors in-
fluence each of these evaluations and de-
cisions. The 2 approaches have comple-
mentary strengths and weaknesses but are
logistically difficult to combine.13
As previous studies indicate, a key
variable when deciding whether to seek
help is the perception of need.14-16 Many

who have mental health problems do not think they need
treatment because they believe the symptoms are tem-
porary or not serious. Alternatively, individuals may not
perceive a need because they do not recognize their prob-
lem as a mental health problem, do not know that ap-
propriate help is available, believe that treatment will not
help, do not find services accessible, are embarrassed about
seeking help, fear stigmatization, or, in the case of se-
vere psychotic disorders, lack insight into the pathologi-
cal nature of their symptoms. In short, what appears to
be a simple objective report of perceived need is influ-
enced by the social context and the decisions people make
in response to symptoms. Understanding how per-
ceived need for professional help relates to a constella-
tion of illness behavior variables helps structure pro-
grams that lead to appropriate care for those who need
it most.
In this study, we used data from the NCS8 to exam-
ine correlates of different stages in the help-seeking pro-
cess. We hypothesized that psychopathology is not the
sole determinant of the help-seeking process and that vari-
ous psychosocial variables also determine whether indi-
viduals seek help. To test this hypothesis, we examined
correlates of perceived need among participants with psy-
chiatric disorders, correlates of seeking professional help
among those who perceived a need, and correlates of seek-
ing help from mental health professionals among those
who sought professional help.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
SAMPLE
The NCS is a multistage stratified survey of 8089 individu-
als between the ages of 15 to 54 years who were selected
from the noninstitutionalized household population of the
48 coterminous states.8,17 The survey was administered be-
tween September 1990 and February 1992 and had a re-
sponse rate of 82.4%. Informed consent was obtained from
all participants aged 18 years and older. For participants
younger than 18 years, informed consent was obtained from
parents.
The NCS interview was composed of 2 parts. Part 1,
administered to all participants, included core diagnostic
questions covering all diagnoses included in the NCS ex-
cept for nonaffective psychoses and posttraumatic stress dis-
order. Part 2, which included questions about nonaffec-
tive psychoses, posttraumatic stress disorder, and service
use, was administered to a probability subsample of 5877
participants (all those identified as having a lifetime dis-
order in part 1, all 15- to 24-year-olds, and a random sub-
sample of other participants in part 1). In this study, we
report data on 1792 participants in part 2 who met the cri-
teria for at least 1 common mood, anxiety, or substance dis-
order. The data were weighted to adjust for differential prob-
abilities of selection and differential nonresponse, and to
approximate the cross-classification of the population dis-
tribution on a range of sociodemographic characteris-
tics.8,18
ASSESSMENTS
Help-seeking was defined in 2 ways. First, any voluntary
contact with a professional for emotional or substance use
problems was considered help-seeking. Contact was rated
separately for different types of professionals, including for-
mal providers (such as mental health workers, general prac-
titioners, and other physicians) and informal providers (such
as ministers, priests, spiritualists, and herbalists). How-
ever, separate analyses limited to formal health care pro-
viders produced similar results (data not shown). Second,
any voluntary contact with psychiatrists, psychologists, or
social workers was considered help-seeking from mental
health professionals, even if the participant also reported
contact with other professionals. The timing of the partici-
pant's last contact with each professional was also noted,
and we focused on contact made within the past 12 months.
We used a procedure described in earlier NCS analy-
ses16,19 to assess perceived need for professional help. For
participants who had not seen a professional in the past 12
months, perceived need was defined as a positive answer
to the question: "Was there ever a time during the past 12
months when you felt that you might need to see a profes-
sional because of problems with your emotions or nerves
or your use of alcohol or drugs?" For participants who had
seen a professional, perceived need was assumed if they in-
dicated that they had voluntarily contacted the profes-
sional. Although reports of perceived need are subject to
memory and other distortions, limiting the recall period
to the past 12 months may have reduced the likelihood of
such errors.
Sociodemographic variables of age, race/ethnicity, and
education analyzed in this study were defined in a similar
way as in earlier NCS reports.8,17 With regard to insurance
coverage, participants were divided into 3 categories: (1)
those covered by Medicaid, welfare, or any other public as-
sistance; (2) those with a health insurance plan other than
Medicaid that covered all or part of the costs for mental
health care outside of a hospital; and (3) those who were
not covered by any plans, did not know if they were cov-
ered, or did not know the extent of their coverage. The cat-
egories are a crude indicator of insurance coverage that do
not consider the exact extent of coverage, presence of co-
insurance, or deductible amount, all of which can impose
barriers to care. Furthermore, individuals who had used
services may have been more likely to know about the ex-
tent of coverage. Therefore, the effect of insurance on
service use may be a result, rather than a determinant, of
utilization.
The diagnoses in NCS were based on a modified ver-
sion of the World Health Organization's Composite Inter-
national Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Based on informa-
tion from these interviews, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition (DSM-III-R)20 life-
time and 12-month diagnoses were generated with the CIDI
diagnostic program. Data presented in this study are based
on the 12-month diagnoses, and 12 such diagnoses, grouped
in 3 categories, were used in this study. The categories were
(1) mood disorders, including major depression and dys-
thymia; (2) anxiety disorders, including generalized anxi-
ety disorder, panic disorder, simple phobia, social phobia,
agoraphobia with or without panic, and posttraumatic stress
disorder; and (3) substance use disorders, including alco-
hol abuse, nonalcohol drug abuse, alcohol dependence, and

RESULTS
CORRELATES OF PERCEIVED NEED
Of the 1792 participants with one of the 12-month dis-
orders, 32% perceived a need for professional help in a
12-month period. Distribution of perceived need was not
uniform across diagnoses (Table 1). Participants with
comorbid mood and anxiety disorders with or without
comorbid substance disorders were about 3 times more
likely than participants with anxiety disorders alone to
perceive a need for professional help. Substance disor-
der without comorbidity was associated with the lowest
rate of perceived need. Furthermore, substance disor-
der comorbidity had different effects on mood disorders
than on anxiety disorders. Participants with comorbid
mood and substance disorders were less likely than par-
ticipants with noncomorbid mood disorders to think they
needed help. In contrast, participants with comorbid anxi-
ety and substance disorders were more likely than those
with noncomorbid anxiety disorders to perceive a need.
Suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts, and impair-
ment were also strongly associated with perceived need
for help (Table 2). In addition to psychiatric variables,
positive attitude toward mental health help-seeking, physi-
cal conditions, marital loss, female gender, younger age
group (15-24 years), maternal psychopathology, and in-
nonalcohol drug dependence. These categories are rather
broad and heterogeneous, particularly anxiety disorders,
in which self-limited simple phobias are classified with the
more serious panic and posttraumatic stress disorders. To
assess the impact of such categorization, we repeated the
analyses for diagnosis after excluding simple phobia (data
not shown). The results of these additional analyses were
quite similar to those reported here.
Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were not in-
cluded in this study because of their low prevalence and
uncertain validity in the NCS.21,22 The reliability and va-
lidity of the CIDI diagnoses included in this study have been
established in previous field trials23 and in clinical reap-
praisal studies.24-27
The level of impairment was evaluated by asking par-
ticipants to indicate how much their symptoms interfered
with their lives and activities on a scale ranging from "not
at all" to "a lot." Participants who stated symptoms caused
"a lot" of interference with their lives and activities were
considered severely impaired. This rating was done sepa-
rately for every diagnosis, except for substance disorders
and posttraumatic stress disorder.
Suicidality was assessed with 3 sets of questions that
asked whether the participant had ever thought about,
planned, or attempted suicide. If a question was answered
affirmatively, follow-up questions assessed the timing of
the event. Only reports of suicide ideation, plans, or at-
tempts in the past 12 months were used in this analysis.
Physical health status was assessed with 2 ratings. First,
participants were asked: "How would you rate your over-
all physical health? Is it excellent, very good, good, fair, or
poor?" In this study, "poor" and "fair" self-ratings were com-
bined and contrasted with the combined "good," "very
good," and "excellent" ratings. The second physical health
variable was based on a self-report of specific health con-
ditions over the past 12 months. Participants were asked
to indicate specific conditions from a list with 14 catego-
ries. The list included musculoskeletal (eg, severe arthri-
tis), respiratory (eg, severe asthma, tuberculosis), cardio-
vascular (eg, heart attack), gastrointestinal (eg, ulcer),
endocrine (eg, diabetes), and neurological (eg, multiple scle-
rosis, epilepsy) disorders as well as cancer, acquired im-
munodeficiency syndrome, and other conditions.
Attitudes toward mental health help-seeking were as-
sessed by asking participants to respond to 3 hypothetical
situations: (1) whether the participant would seek help when
faced with a serious emotional problem; (2) how comfort-
able he or she would feel talking about personal problems
with a professional; and (3) how embarrassing it would be
if friends knew about the professional help. The answers
were ranked on a 4-point Likert scale (highly favorable to
highly unfavorable). The dichotomous rating of attitudes
was constructed by median split on the sum of the item
scores.
Supportive relationships were assessed separately for
spouse or partner, relatives, and friends. Each relation-
ship was assessed with a 6-item scale. Items concerning par-
ticipants' relationships with their spouses or partners asked
how much the spouse really cared for the participant, un-
derstood the way he or she felt about things, and appreci-
ated him or her; how much the participant could rely on
the spouse or partner for help with serious problems, could
openly talk to the spouse or partner about worries, and could
relax around the spouse or partner. Parallel items asked
about supportive relationships with relatives and friends
among participants who had contact with these individu-
als. Responses to each item were coded from 1 (not at all)
to 4 (a lot). The dichotomous rating of social support was
based on median splits on summed scores.
Parental psychopathology was assessed with ques-
tions about symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sub-
stance use disorder. Each parent was addressed sepa-
rately, and after each set of questions, participants were asked
whether their parents ever sought professional care or were
hospitalized for psychiatric problems.
DATA ANALYSES
We conducted 3 sets of binary logistic regression analy-
ses. First, we examined correlates of perceived need. Sec-
ond, we examined correlates of help-seeking among par-
ticipants with a perceived need. Third, we examined
correlates of seeking help from mental health profession-
als among participants who had sought professional help.
Analyses were conducted once without any covariates (bi-
variate analyses) in the model and a second time adjusting
for the psychiatric variables of diagnosis, impairment, and
suicidality. A Cronbach  level of P .01 was used for all
analyses.
For the analyses reported here, we adopted a design-
based approach, in which frequency weights, strata, and
primary sampling units were used to adjust the parameter
estimates and their variances.28 The Taylor series linear-
lization method, as implemented in the "svytab" and "svy-
logit" routines of Stata 6.0 (Stata Co, College Station, Tex),
was used for these computations.

surance coverage were positively correlated with per-
ceived need for professional help, even after controlling
for psychopathology (Table 2).
CORRELATES OF HELP-SEEKING
Of the 571 participants who perceived a need for pro-
fessional help, 59% sought such help. None of the psy-
chiatric variables that predicted perceived need were sig-
nificant correlates of help-seeking. Older age (45-54
years), having a physical condition, and positive atti-
tudes toward mental health help-seeking were associ-
ated with seeking professional help (Table 2).
CORRELATES OF HELP-SEEKING
FROM MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS
Finally, of the 335 participants who sought professional
help, 44% sought help from mental health profession-
als. The nature and severity of psychopathology ap-
peared to be an important predictor of help-seeking from
mental health professionals. Individuals with comorbid
anxiety and substance disorders and comorbid mood,
anxiety, and substance disorders were more likely to con-
tact mental health professionals. The majority of the par-
ticipants with comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance
disorders who sought professional help sought help from
mental health care providers (Table 1). In contrast, less
than a third of all participants with noncomorbid anxi-
ety disorders who sought help did so from mental health
professionals. For the analyses of help-seeking from men-
talhealthprofessionals,thenumberofparticipantsinsome
of the diagnostic groups was rather small. Male gender,
positive attitudes toward professional help, and insur-
ance coverage were also associated with seeking help from
mental health professionals among those who had sought
professional help (Table 2).
COMMENT
In interpreting these results, the limitations of this study
and the NCS should be considered. First, for partici-
pants who had seen a professional, perceived need was
inferred if they reported that they had voluntarily sought
help. This measure of perceived need may not be as ac-
curate as a direct question. However, it is reassuring that
participants who perceived a need but did not seek care
were indistinguishable from those who sought care with
regard to the nature and severity of psychopathology, the
strongest correlates of perceived need in our study. Sec-
ond, our analyses were limited to individuals with an NCS
diagnosis of a mental disorder. Another important ques-
tion is the extent and correlates of perceived need and
help-seeking among individuals who did not have a di-
agnosis. Additional analyses indicated that participants
without diagnoses are less likely to perceive a need than
participants with diagnoses (10% vs 32%). After perceiv-
ing a need, however, they are as likely to seek care (61%
vs 59%), although they are less likely to seek care from
mental health professionals (28% vs 44%). The corre-
lates of perceived need were similar in subjects with and
without diagnoses (data not shown). Thus, diagnosis is
associated with perceived need and help-seeking from
mental health professionals, but not with help-seeking
in general after perceiving need. Third, both the assess-
ment of perceived need and help-seeking in the NCS were
based on 12-month recall. A shorter recall period might
have produced more accurate results.
Previous studies of perceived need and help-
seeking provide context for our findings.29-34 Of these,
the Ontario Health Survey29 used methods similar to the
NCS. Comparison of the 2 surveys revealed that more
people in the United States than in Ontario, Canada, per-
ceived a need for help and used services. After control-
ling for perceived need, most of the between-country varia-
tions in service use disappeared. Thus, perceived need
explains variations in service use across as well as within
settings.
Similar to previous studies, we found higher rates
of perceived need among women30-33; participants who
were divorced, separated, or widowed30,31,33; partici-
pants with physical problems33; and younger partici-
pants.30,31,33 Like previous studies, we found no associa-
tion between these variables and help-seeking after need
was established30,31 and a higher likelihood of help-
seeking after need was felt among the middle-aged.30-32
Few studies, primarily surveys done several de-
cades ago,30,31 have examined perceived need for profes-

sional help in the US population. Some more recent stud-
ies of service use have also noted relationships between
education or minority status and the likelihood of men-
tal health visits.35,36 Unlike these studies, we did not find
perceived need or help-seeking associated with educa-
tion, race, or income. Most previous analyses were based
on general population samples, not specifically persons
with psychiatric diagnoses. It is noteworthy, however,

that recent analyses of a 1997-1998 US survey also re-
vealed educational disparities in service use in a sample
of individuals with mood and anxiety disorders.37
We also found higher rates of perceived need among
participants with a maternal history of mental illness. This
finding may reflect increased recognition of mental ill-
ness among the offspring of parents with psychiatric dis-
orders or less willingness to rely on informal support net-
works as a result of childhood experiences.
Interestingly, few of the correlates of perceived need
predicted help-seeking among individuals who per-
ceived a need. The nonsignificant effects of psychiatric
variables are, perhaps, as noteworthy as the significant
effects. After the need for professional help is perceived,
the nature and severity of psychopathology do not affect
the decision to seek help. The major determinants of help-
seeking among individuals with a perceived need for pro-
fessional help are sociodemographic and attitudinal.
The nature and severity of psychopathology, how-
ever, did affect the choice of care providers. Individuals
with more severe comorbid disorders38 were more likely
to seek care from mental health professionals. This sug-

gests progress toward a targeted care system in which the
more severely ill seek help from the more specialized pro-
fessionals and the less severely ill from nonspecialized
professionals.
One of the explanations proposed for the mis-
match between the rates of mental disorders in the com-
munity and rates of help-seeking is that the rates of dis-
orders are exaggerated and do not reflect the true need
for care.39 The results of the present study provide par-
tial support for this hypothesis. A majority of individu-
als with less severe or impairing psychopathology may
have recognized the self-limited nature of their prob-
lems and did not perceive a need for professional help.
However, many of the individuals with disorders who
do not perceive a need experience distress and impair-
ment and could potentially benefit from professional help.
In this sample, for example, 26% of participants who met
the criteria for 1 of the disorders in the study but who
did not perceive a need for professional help reported se-
vere impairment in their daily activities. Furthermore,
about 5% reported suicidal ideation, plans, or attempts
during the past year. Thus, experiencing a need for pro-
fessional help is not a direct response to distress and im-
pairment, and even after controlling for distress and im-
pairment, various sociodemographic and attitudinal
factors affect both perceived need and help-seeking. The
effects of these sociodemographic and attitudinal fac-
tors reflect the complex evaluations and decisions that
characterize "illness behavior."40
A model of help-seeking as a series of stages,11,41,42
as illustrated here, can inform interventions that seek to
achieve a better correspondence between need and use
of appropriate services. Strategies aimed at changing at-
titudes and motivating help-seeking are essential for en-
couraging persons with disabling conditions who do not
perceive a need for professional care to use services. There
is some limited evidence that screening and targeted edu-
cational campaigns affect attitudes43-45 and help-seeking
behavior.46-48 However, we believe that it is essential to
go beyond such efforts and seek to integrate motiva-
tional and cognitive aspects of behavior change with spe-
cific instructional plans.49,50
Results from our study also point to some groups that
are less likely to express a need for professional help when
experiencing psychiatric problems. Two such groups that
couldbethetargetofeducationalinterventionsareyounger
individualsandmen.Educationalprogramsspecificallyde-
signed for schools have had promising results.44,51 Simi-
lar programs could be developed for male-dominated work
environments, such as the military.
For individuals who do perceive a need, a more ac-
ceptingattitudetowardprofessionalhelpmayfacilitatehelp-
seeking. Many of the barriers to care at this stage, how-
ever, are objective barriers such as financial problems or
the time costs of care. Intervention at this stage, therefore,
may require large-scale policy initiatives. Of the NCS par-
ticipants who had perceived a need but not sought care,
39%saidthatprofessionalcarewastooexpensive,28%that
their health insurance would not cover it, and 30% that it
would take too much time or be too inconvenient.
Finally, our results echo earlier general population
surveys such as the Midtown Manhattan Study of the
1950s, which estimated that the majority of individuals
with serious mental health problems were not receiving
care from mental health professionals.52 Although the rates
of professional care for mental illness have increased im-
pressively since then, unmet need for care still remains
a large public health problem.
