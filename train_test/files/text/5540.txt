Hormesis at the National Toxicology Program (NTP):
Evidence of Hormetic Dose Responses in NTP
Dose-Range Studies

ABSTRACT
The National Toxicology Program (~TP) dose-ranging studies typically employ
five dosages and a concurrent control and are conducted for 2- and I3-week expo-
sure periods. Because five doses are employed it suggested the possibilities of the
occurrence of sub-l\'OAEL doses in many of these bioassays and of evaluating the
occurrence of hormesis within the NTP bioassay. As a result, 59 environmentally
relevant agents in the NTP toxicity database were assessed for their capacity to affect
hormetic dose responses for growth as measured by change: in weight gain. Honnetic
effects were observed with 51 (88%) of the 58 agents evaluated. '\11e11 considered
by species, hormetic effects were observed in 48o/c (98/20;)) of bioassays involving
mice and 14% (29/204) of bioassays involving rats. Hormetic effects were seen in
a comparable fashion between males and females of both mice (i.e., 47 male and
51 female) and rats (13 male and 16 female rats). These observations represent a
new finding within the NTP bioassay database that han' potential implications for
issues relating to study design and endpoint measured. as well as underlying bio-
logical mechanisms that affect efficiency of nutrient utilization under conditions of
low-level toxicant exposure.

INTRODUCTION
Honnesis is a dose-response phenomenon characterized by a high-dose inhibi-
tion and a low-dose stimulation (Fig. 1). Recent publications have revealed that
hormesis is highly generalizable according to agent, biological model, and endpoint
measured (Calabrese and Baldwin, 1997, 2001a; Calabrese et al., 1999). Other re-
search has indicated that hormetic effects may be seen in up to 40% of toxicological
experiments that satisfy a prioristudy design requirements (Calabrese and Baldwin,
2001 b) and are more common than the traditional threshold model in a substan-
tial direct comparison (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003). Because study designs that
include a substantial number of dosages are more likely to have the opportunity to
assess hormetic phenomena, it is suggested that the dose-range-finding studies of
the National Toxicology Program (NTP) may offer potential to explore honnetic re-
sponses because these experiments typically contain a current control and five doses.
Consequently, this paper evaluates the occurrence ofhonnetic dose responses within
the NTP database for dose-range-finding experiments.

(Table 1). The study design of the subchronir toxicity bioassay tvpicallv consists of
a control plus five doses and is conducted for 2- and 13-week exposure periods with
both sexes ofyoung (i.e., 4-S-week week-old) Fishel 341 rats and BGC3Fl mice. This
permits evaluation of the capacity of youn~ animals to display liormetic responses
within the contexts of interspecies variation, ~ender, and exposure scenario.
Endpoint Selection
Gain in body weight was chosen as the parameter [or evaluation of hormetic re-
sponse. Due to its possible impact on body-weight, feed consumption data (when
available) were also assessed and directly compared with body-weight gain. Because
disease incidence is essentially negligible within the 2- and 13-week exposure scenar-
ios of the toxicity studies it is not an appropriate endpoint. Other I»uameters, such
as serum chemistry and hematologv data, also do not lend themselves to hormetic

evaluation because any change from homeostasis would be considered harmful or
of unknown significance.
Evaluation Criteria
Evidence ofhormesis was evaluated for gain in body weight using the quantitative
ranking scheme of Calabrese and Baldwin (1997; Table 2) for inverted V-shaped
curves. The capacity for an experiment to demonstrate hormesis was assessed by
comparing the summation ofpointvalues to point ranges establishedfor six evidence
categories: high, moderate-high, moderate, low-moderate, low, and no-low.

the corresponding percentage range. For example, if an experiment has three doses
exhibiting stimulatory responses within the 125-150% range, then the total number
of points will be 3 x 1.0 = 3.

Dose-Response Curve Quantification
The features of the dose-response relationships quantified in this analysis are the
maximum stimulatory response, the width of the stimulatory zone, and the distance
from the maximum stimulatory response to the zero equivalent point (ZEP; i.e., the
highest dose showing a response equal to the control response; Fig. 1).
Relational/Retrieval Database
Data for those studies demonstrating evidence of hormesis were entered into an
existing relational/retrieval database created in FoxPro to facilitate evaluation.
RESULTS
Quantified data for calculation of percent weight gain were provided in 48 of
the 49 NTP toxicity reports. Evidence of hormesis was observed in 45 of these
48 reports (94%). A total of409 dose-response relationships (i.e., bioassays) involving
58 agents and rats and/or mice were evaluated for evidence ofhormesis. Assessment
by individual dose-response relationships revealed that honnetic effects are present
in 31% (128/409) ofdose-range-finding hioassays involving rats and mice (Table 3).
Based on the ranking scheme, the majority of these dose-response relationships
demonstratecllow evidence of hormesis (i.e., 76% or 98/128). Low-to-moderate ev-
idence was observed in 16% (21/128) of the dose-response relationships, moderate
evidence in 5% (6/128), moderate-to-high evidence in 1.5% (2/128), and high ev-
idence in 0.8% (1/128). Representative close-response relationships derived from
the NTP toxicity data are displaved in Figure 2.
Feed consumption information was generally only reponed when the route of
exposure was through feed. Of the 10 reports presenting quantitative feed con-
sumption information, the data did not appear to account for the honnetic effects
observed for weight gain (Fig. 3).
'When evaluated by species, hermetic effects were observed in 48% (98/205) of
bioassays involving mice and 14% (29/204) of bioassays involving rats (i.e., hormetic
effects were more often observed in mice than rats by a [actor of 3.4). Assessment by
gender revealed that hermetic effects were observed siniilarlv in males and females
(i.e., 47 male and 51 female mice; 13 male and 16 fe-male rats).
Concordance of the hormetic response over time (i.e.. hormctic effects observed
at the end of the 2-week bioassay were also seen at the end 01 the 13-week bioassay)
was observed only in mice with females showing' coucord.mce I., limes more oflen
than males [i.e., 11 of 18 bioassays (GI %) involving female mice showing evidence
ofhormesis at 2 weeks also showed evidence of hormesis at 13 weeks compared to 8
01'22 bioassays (36%) involving male mice].
Assessment by agent revealed that hermetic effects were observed with 51 (88%)
of the 58 agents tested. (Quantitative weight data was not provided in the toxic-
ity report on ethylbenzene.) Hormetic effects were not observed in bioassays with
p-chloro-a,a,a-trifluorotoluene, 11I/jKresol, »-hexane, mixture of 25 groundwater

DISCUSSION
The occurrence of honnetic dose-response relationships within the NTP bioas-
say database represents a new finding. The honnetic observations in these NTP
range-finding studies demonstrate the significance of study design features in the

assessment ofpossible hormetic dose-response relationships. In the present case, the
dose-range-finding studies of the NTP typically employed five dosages along with a
concurrent control. The dosage selection was also focused on trying to estimate the
highest dosages that could be administered over a normal experimental lifetime.
These two factors [i.e., number of dosages, and their intention to discern a possible
dosage that would approximate a chronic no adverse effect level (NOAEL)] en-
hanced the chances of observing hormetic dose response. The additional dosages
are critical to demonstrate a dose-response pattern consistent with the hormetic
model. The attempt to identify a quasi NOAEL is also important because it provides
an opportunity to denote the dose-response transition from a hormetic response,
just below the NOAEL, and the traditional toxic response as the NOAEL is exceeded.
While the dose-range studies of the NTP offered the aforementioned study de-
sign advantages, it also had important limitations especially with respect to endpoint
selection. Because the mice and rats were very young and the studies were of limited
duration (2-13 weeks), disease incidences were not expected to increase and typically
did not occur, thereby precluding a "ide range of toxicological endpoint compar-
isons. Nonetheless, during this developmental period there are notable changes in
growth patterns as reflected in changes in body-weight gain. The body-weight-gain
pattern is also one that represents an integration of overall developmental progress
and offers important insight for biomedical and toxicological interpretation.
The quantitative features of the hormetic dose-response patterns were similar to
those reported in previously published studies for various biological models, end-
points, and other chronic agents. This was the case for both the magnitude of the
stimulation and the stimulatory range.
The findings revealed that honnetic responses were more common in mice, es-
pecially in males, than in rats. While there is no explanation to yet account for these
observations it may have both biological as well as study design considerations.
Despite the large number of examples of hormetic dose-response relationships
presented and the relatively strong NTP study designs assessed in the present paper, it
is important to emphasize that the magnitude of the honnetic stimulation is modest.
This places special need on not only the quality of the study design but also the need
[or replication of findings, a feature generally absent in the NTP bioassay database.
Such lack of replication limits confidence in the observed findings and the hormetic
interpretation.
Finally, the observation that the enhanced weight gain at low dosages was not
accounted for by an increased consumption of feed is intriguing (Figs. 3A-H). Al-
though of a preliminary nature, it suggests that at the low dosages where hormetic
responses were observed there may have been an enhanced efficiency in the utiliza-
tion of consumed nutrients. The issue of growth stimulation by low doses of other
toxic substances such as antibiotics (Luckey, 1956, 1958, 1978; Luckey et al., 1956)
and diethylstilbestrol (DES) (Nicol and Ware, 1960) has long been recognized. Al-
though their dose-response features are similar to the findings of the present study,
