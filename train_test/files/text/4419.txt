Introduction
This paper explores the representation of religious agendas
by Republican members of the US House of Representatives
in the 104th Congress (1995­1996). We ask: is there evi-
dence of intra-party division, and is it informed by religion?
Almost 20 years has passed since the historic midterm con-
gressional elections of 1994 that ended four decades of
uninterrupted Democratic control of the House.At the time,
many observers believed that the country was at the begin-
ning of a new era of cohesive Republican dominance
(Cloud, 1994; Cooper and Young, 1997). Republicans had
successfully defied the aphorism that "all politics is local"
by running on a national agenda; they brought the
Appropriations Committee under party control (Aldrich
and Rohde, 2000); and they showed tremendous unity on
the floor. We argue that while Republicans rallied around a
core agenda, below the surface members pursued diverse
policy agendas influenced partly by religion.
Looking back to an earlier era of Republican ascend-
ance allows us to learn something about the current era of
party politics. Studying the 104th Congress reveals that the
defining features of contemporary congressional dysfunc-
tion were laid down in the early 1990s. The 104th Congress
had been the most ideologically polarized and least
productive to date. In part, this was owed to candidate
recruitment and the movement of Evangelical Protestants
and white Catholics from the Democratic Caucus into the
Republican Conference. Since then, each House has been
more polarized than the last, culminating in the 113th
Congress (2013­2014).1 Then as now, however, the ability
of the majority party to govern was partly undone by intra-
party division.
Several scholars have established systematic patterns of
legislative behavior shaped by religion (Fastnow et al.,
1999; Green and Guth, 1991;McTague and Pearson-
Merkowitz, 2013; Oldmixon, 2005), but the importance of
religious agendas may be masked by focusing on roll call
voting. Following Burden (2007), we investigate represen-
tation in an area unconstrained by party leaders: floor
speeches. The analysis provides a greater understanding of
Discourse and dissonance: religious
agendas in the 104th Congress

Abstract
This paper investigates the religious dimension of Republican legislators' participation in one-minute speeches during
the 104th Congress (1995­1996). Many have characterized the House Republican Conference that emerged after the
1994 elections as a highly cohesive majority party. Even in that context, however, legislators represent varied personal
agendas, and in part these are informed by religion. We topically coded a subset of floor speeches to measure the extent
to which variation is observed in the issues addressed by Members of Congress. The findings demonstrate that on key
policy domains, such as the role of government, culture, and social welfare, speech participation varies systematically on
the basis of member religion. This suggests that legislative participation is influenced by genuine personal preferences in
additional to strategic political factors.

the roots of contemporary congressional dynamics.
Moreover, it affords a greater understanding of the com-
plexities of governance. As the recent kerfuffle over the
pulled House abortion bill demonstrates (Newhauser and
Fox, 2015), it is difficult for leadership to set an agenda that
resonates with the entire party when it divides along reli-
gious lines. Moreover, this study provides an opportunity to
consider larger issues of representation. Participation in the
legislative process is uneven (Hall, 1996). Members are
time constrained and have different interests. As a result
they make different, purposive choices as to whether and
how to participate in the policy process. The decision to
participate affects the kinds of agendas that are represented
in Congress. To the extent that religion informs representa-
tion, its importance in the legislative arena is more signifi-
cant than legislative scholars generally recognize.
Theory
The religious context
When Republicans took over as the House majority in
1995, they moved quickly on their core agenda. Most items
died in the Senate or were vetoed by the president, but the
Republican Conference behaved like a unified, responsible
party. Indeed, the level of party unity voting, votes on
which a majority of Republicans opposed a majority of
Democrats, rose to 73% of House votes. Even so, the
Conference included several notable ideological policy fac-
tions. Some were animated by a strong sense that the
national government was too big and that it stifled eco-
nomic growth; others were deeply concerned with cultural
and moral decay. Moderate elements of the Conference
may have been sympathetic to the economic and cultural
agendas of their colleagues, but they were less ideological
on both dimensions (Koopman, 1996; Rae, 1998).
We argue that apparent party unity belied a diverse
Conference, and that this diversity was owed in part to
members' personal values. Burden (2007) notes that while
we often think of representatives as highly responsive to
external cues, such as constituency preferences, they are
often attentive to internal or introspective cues. These cues
"probably do not trump partisanship on most roll call
votes", but "the conditions under which personal character-
istics matter are widespread and predictable" (Burden,
2007: 16). In the same way, Hall (1996: 56) argues that in
addition to pursing electoral and partisan interests, mem-
bers pursue their own "personal policy interests and ideo-
logical commitments".
We focus on religion as a source of personal values. The
political significance of religion is owed to several factors.
The ethno-religious approach emphasizes belonging. In
belonging to a religious community, individuals are exposed
to shared teachings that produce a common worldview, and
the shared social status commonly experienced by many
communities of believers. Together, shared values and
social experiences provide a lens through which religious
people view the world. To the extent that the world does not
comport with their norms, religion provides the basis of
political grievance and engagement Wald and Calhoun-
Brown (2011). Crosscutting these traditional alignments,
the religious restructuring approach emphasizes believing
and behaving. Sometimes called the "New Gap", this
approach notes the diversity within religious traditions,
especially on the basis of traditionalism, which is the extent
to which individuals internalize the authority of religion.
In the context of the 104th Congress, the prominence of
Catholics and Evangelical Protestants is especially notable.
By the early 1990s, white Catholics, especially the most
observant white Catholics, had been moving into the
Republican camp for several years (Green, 2010; Wald and
Calhoun-Brown, 2011). For their part, Evangelical
Protestants firmly established themselves as a key
Republican voting block in the late 1970s. They did not
comprise a majority of the Conference in the 104th Congress,
but evangelical groups such as The Christian Coalition pro-
vided Republican congressional candidates tremendous
support in 1992 and 1994, and these were elections in which
more than half of the Conference in the 104th Congress first
entered Congress (Koopman, 1996; Rae, 1998).
Reflecting these mass level changes, the religious com-
position of House Republicans changed dramatically in the
latter half of the 20th century. Guth (2014a) reports that in
the 103rd Congress (1993­1994), 49.4% of House
Republicans identified as Mainline Protestant. This is down
from 68.8% in 83rd Congress (1953­1954). Mainline
decline was accompanied by growth in the proportion of
white evangelicals and white Catholics. The proportion of
white evangelicals more than doubled (from 6.9% of House
Republicans in the 83rd Congress to 15.2% in the 103rd
Congress). In that same timeframe, the percentage of white
Catholics in the Republican Conference nearly doubled
(from 10.6% to 21.6%). Thus, while the post-war era
Republican Conferences were dominated by Mainline
Protestants, Republican Conferences in the 1990s were
more pluralistic. It is because of this increased level of plu-
ralism that we expect to find diverse policy agendas among
House Republicans in the 104th Congress.
Religious agendas
The kinds of issues that comprise religiously informed pol-
icy agendas are myriad. We consider the following: cultural
traditionalism, poverty and social welfare, and the role of
government. These are operationalized as a count of
speeches aligned with specific codes (Baumgartner and
Jones, 2014).
Cultural traditionalism is central to Evangelical
Protestants and Catholics. The perception among evangeli-
cals of cultural degradation played an important role in their
Blackstone and Oldmixon 3
political mobilization.Among Catholics, cultural traditional-
ism has been tremendously important to the Bishops
Conference, which has encouraged mass level activism
among lay Catholics in support of Catholic teachings. We
use the following speech topics as proxies for cultural tradi-
tionalism: Civil Rights, Minority Issues, and Civil Liberties;
Immigration; Law, Crime, and Family Issues; Presidential
Impeachment and Scandal  = 0.6205
( ). We expect that
Catholic and evangelical representatives will speak at higher
levels on these issues than their colleagues, most of whom
are Mainline Protestants.
Poverty and social welfare are likely to be salient among
Evangelical Protestants and Catholics alike. Catholic teach-
ing on these kinds of issues lends itself to policy focused on
alleviating the structural factors that produce poverty and
injustice. This has commonly entailed support for a robust
welfare state. Many evangelicals, however, oppose govern-
ment expansion generally and expanding the welfare state
specifically (Koopman, 1996), as it is thought to create a
dependence on government and undermine virtue. While
Catholics and evangelicals approach these issues differ-
ently, they were and are central to both. We use speeches
on the following topics as proxies for poverty and social
welfare: Health; Social Welfare; Education; Labor,
Employment, and Immigration  = 0.7012
( ). We expect
that Catholic and evangelical representatives will speak at
higher levels on these issues than their colleagues.
Finally, we consider the role of government. We do not
have a particular expectation for Catholics. Among evan-
gelicals, however, the scope of government was (and is) a
major flashpoint. Barker and Carman (2000) argue that
Evangelical Protestants are more likely to support a limited
role for government given the centrality of individual work
and virtue inherent in Calvinist theology. We use the fol-
lowing speech topics as proxies for the role of government:
National Budget and Debt; Taxation, Tax Policy, and Tax
Reform; Budget Requests for Various Agencies and
Independent Commissions; Intergovernmental Relations
 = 0.6920
( ). We expect evangelicals to speak at higher
levels on these issues than their colleagues.
Data. The difficulty in sussing out the influence of religion
on legislative behavior is in deciding where to look. The
focus on roll call voting among congressional scholars is
understandable, given that this is where policy is made. It is
not, however, where policy is developed, and it is also
tightly controlled by the leadership. Roll call votes present
members with dyadic choices that may not represent the
full range of their preferences. Moreover, the concept of
representation is broader than a focus on roll call analysis
would suggest. MCs have myriad opportunities to act on
behalf of their constituents. Sulkin (2005) and Schiller
(1995), for example, have found that members actively pro-
mote their agendas via the introduction and co-sponsorship
of legislation.
Echoing Burden (2007: 8), we look for personal represen-
tation "upstream in the policy process", where members
have greater agency. Specifically, we analyze one-minute
speeches. Party leadership solicits speeches and distributes
talking points (Harris, 2005), but rank and file members have
access to the floor outside of leadership coordination efforts.
While acknowledging that there are multiple avenues for
personal representation, we focus on speeches because by
the 104th Congress they had become an increasingly impor-
tant tool among legislators, especially after cameras were
placed in the chamber in 1979. Gingrich himself noted that
speeches provide an opportunity to discuss complex topics
(Maltzman and Sigelman, 1996). While few members are
present in the chamber while one-minute speeches are deliv-
ered, "every House office is tuned in to C-SPAN to watch
morning proceedings in the chamber... Members and staff
watch one-minute speeches or at least monitor the subjects
being discussed, along with considerable interest in which
Members are speaking" (Shogan et al., 2013: 3). One-minute
speeches are a vehicle through which representatives can
express their legislative policy agenda to constituents and
colleagues (Maltzman and Sigelman, 1996), and they may be
a vehicle for shoring up electoral goals (Morris, 2001).
We identified 787 speeches delivered by Republicans
during the second session of the 104th Congress (3 January
1996 to 4 October 1996).2 The speeches were coded topi-
cally to measure the extent to which members from differ-
ent religious communities articulated distinct agendas. We
employ the major topic and subtopic codes and the coding
guidelines of the Policy Agendas Project (Baumgartner and
Jones, 2014) to classify speeches on the basis of their con-
tent. The Policy Agendas Project Codebook includes 30
major topics (e.g. Macroeconomics, Health, and Education).
Within each major topic, there are more nuanced subtopic
measures. For example, the major topic Macroeconomics,
includes nine subtopics including: inflation, prices, and
interest rates; unemployment rate; and national budget and
debt. We assigned up to two major and subtopic codes for
each speech.3
Figure 1 reports the number of speeches addressing each
of the PolicyAgendas Project's major topics. Because some
speeches are assigned two major topic codes, the total of
speech issues is 976. A total of 25% of speeches address
Government Operations, which includes discussion of
budget requests, appropriations for multiple departments
and agencies, intergovernmental relations, government
efficiency and bureaucratic oversight, congressional opera-
tions, nominations and appointments, and presidential
impeachment and scandal. A total of 20% of speeches
address Macroeconomics. Health is the third-most popular
topic with 13% of speeches addressing a health-related
policy. These include, for example, speeches on health care
reform, insurance availability, and regulation of the drug
industry. The remaining 40% of speeches are distributed
across the remaining topics.
4 Research and Politics 
Member religion is our primary independent variable of
interest. We measure this in two ways. Drawing on the
ethno-religious approach, and given the movement of
Catholics and Evangelical Protestants to the Republican
Party at the mass level and in Congress, we classify mem-
bers by religious tradition following Steensland et al.(2000),
and include two indicator variables (Catholic = 1;
Evangelical Protestant = 1) in our models. Drawing on the
restructuring approach, we include a measure of religious
salience, which is based on whether MCs mention religion
in their Congressional Directory biography. Given that
"religious traditionalists usually put greater importance on
the role of religion in their lives, this measure provides
another partial proxy for the theological orientations that
are more difficult and time- consuming to ascertain" (Guth,
2014b: 10). We also include the percentage of each con-
gressional district classified as Catholic and Evangelical
Protestant to control for district-level religion.4
We include additional controls for member ideology,
whether a member is a party leader, the safeness of the
member's district, sex, and tenure.
Member ideology
DW-NOMINATE scores were used to measure member
ideology (Poole and Rosenthal, 1997). These scores range
from ­1 to +1, with ­1 being the most liberal and +1 being
the most conservative. All Republicans in the 104th
Congress had NOMINATE scores in the positive, conserv-
ative range. Pearson and Dancey (2011), Maltzman and
Sigelman (1996), and Morris (2001) all use ideological
extremism to predict the level of speechmaking. We predict
that the most conservative members of the Conference will
be the most energized and most likely take to the floor.
Party leaders
Party leaders have a responsibility to promote the interests
of their party (Cox and McCubbins, 1993). Thus, we
include an indicator variable (party leader = 1) to control
for the possibility that leaders will more likely to use the
floor to that end (Maltzman and Sigelman, 1996).
Safeness
Safeness is measured as a percentage of the vote received
by members in their most recent election. Safer representa-
tives may feel less pressure from the district, and less
urgency than vulnerable representatives to position-take.
Sex.Pearson and Dancey (2011) find that congress-
women are more likely to give one-minute speeches as a
way to make up for their underrepresentation. We include
an indicator variable (male = 1) to control for that
possibility.
Tenure
We use tenure as a measure of seniority. This is the total
number of consecutive years served by the member.
Because more senior members have less of a need to dem-
onstrate policy competency (Morris, 2001; Pearson and
Dancey, 2011), we expect seniority to be negatively associ-
ated with speech participation.

Analysis and discussion
Table 1 illustrates the process by which speech variables
were constructed using the speeches of Representative Jon
Lynn Christensen (NE). Representative Christensen deliv-
ered five speeches; they are catalogued below. One speech
addresses two issues, creating a total of six speech issues. A
total of 50% of Mr Christensen's agenda is allocated to
Health while 16.67% is allocated to Law, Crime, and
Family Issues, 16.67% is allocated to Macroeconomics,
and another 16.67% is devoted to Labor and Employment.
The subtopic-based measure of the agenda provides more
specificity. A total of 33% of Mr Christenen's agenda is
focused on general Health issues. Each of the following
issues is the subject of 16.75% of Mr Christensen's atten-
tion: Alcohol/controlled and illegal drug abuse treatment,
and education; Illegal drug production, trafficking, and
control; National budget and debt; and Fair Labor Standards.
Using the process outlined above, we count the number of
speeches delivered on each topic by each member.
Next, we subject these data to multivariate analysis. Our
dataset includes 236 Republican MCs. On average, each
member delivered 3.3 speeches. The standard deviation is
5.6, suggesting considerable variability in speech participa-
tion. Indeed, the modal level of participation is zero. Rep.
Cass Ballanger (R-NC), at the other extreme, delivered 44
speeches. A total of 30% of the conference did not partici-
pate in speech-making. Thus, we assess the religious dimen-
sion of one-minute speeches using zero-inflated Poisson
regression (Long, 1997). This two-part estimator accounts
for the absence of speeches on the part of many members.
The first stage is a logit model that estimates the probability
of never speaking. The second stage estimates the number
of speeches given (see also Branton, 2009; Rottinghaus and
Bergan, 2011). Thus, we distinguish between members who
never speak and members who sometimes speak. The statis-
tically significant Vuong test indicates that the zero-inflated
Poisson is superior to a standard Poisson model.
Table 2 reports the results of the count analysis. First, we
ask, "which members are the most likely to participate in
speech-making?". We included ideology, tenure, sex, safe-
ness, party leader status as covariates in the first stage model.
To our surprise, the usual suspects did not consistently dis-
criminate between participants and non-participants.
Previous work suggests that we should expect significant,
positive effects for ideology and party leadership, and sig-
nificant, negative effects for tenure, sex, and safeness. The
only significant relationships to emerge were between speech
participation and ideology in the culture and social welfare
models, and between speech participation and tenure in the
social welfare model. Those relationships, however, are not
in the expected direction.
We next consider whether religious belonging affects
the substance of speech participation. The short answer is,
yes and no. In the cultural model, Evangelical Protestants
deliver more speeches than their colleagues. The marginal
effect seems modest, but given that the modal level of par-
ticipation is zero, even modest changes are notable. Catholic
MCs, however, are indistinguishable from their colleagues.
The lack of a significant finding among Catholics is notable
given the centrality of these issues to the Bishops
Conference. Lay Catholic opinion on cultural issues, how-
ever, does not clearly align with Church teachings, and our
findings may reflect that. Indeed, although the relationship
does not achieve conventional significance, the proportion
of Catholics at the district level is negatively associated
with speech participation.
On social welfare issues, we find that religious salience
is negatively related to speech participation. Moreover,
while Catholics are indistinguishable from their colleagues,
Catholics for whom religion is salient discuss social wel-
fare more frequently. While evangelicals are also indistin-
guishable from their colleagues, MCs from strongly
evangelical districts discuss social welfare more frequently.
These representatives may be using their speeches to repre-
sent the religious constituencies in their districts, instead of
representing their personal religious agendas
Finally we note that Catholic members spoke more fre-
quently on the role of government than their colleagues.
Religious salience was also negatively related to speech
participation. Evangelicals were indistinguishable from
their colleagues, but MCs from strongly evangelical dis-
tricts more frequently addressed the role of government. To
provide context, during this timeframe there was a

government shutdown and Republicans had just considered
a balanced budget amendment to the constitution the previ-
ous year. Budget and tax issues, which are major compo-
nents of speeches in this domain, were highly salient. There
has been some debate as to whether fiscal issues were ever
really a priority among evangelicals, or whether it was a
priority among evangelical interest group elites looking to
established common ground with establishment Republican
Party elites. This finding suggests that the role of govern-
ment was not a core priority among evangelical members,
but that it was a priority for members representing evan-
gelical districts.
Conclusion
The Republican Conference of the 104th Congress was a
highly unified governing party. Our results do not under-
mine that characterization.
It is notable and important, however, that even in the
context of a highly unified Conference, we find that
Blackstone and Oldmixon 7
members used speech participation to pursue their own
agendas, and that these agendas were in part informed by
religion. After controlling for the usual suspects, we found
that Catholic members dedicated significantly more agenda
space to the role of government, and Catholics for whom
religion was salient devoted significantly more agenda
space to social welfare. For their part, evangelicals devoted
significantly more agenda space to cultural issues. Across
denominations religious salience was negatively related to
speech participation on social welfare and the role of gov-
ernment. Moreover, while speech participation provides
opportunities for legislators to engage in personal represen-
tation, it also provides opportunities to represent constitu-
ency religious communities. The logic is essentially the
same: legislators with limited opportunities to engage in
representation using floor votes look for other outlets.
Speeches provide an outlet where legislators can advertise
and position-take.
We speculate that the modest impact of religion is partly
the result of party messaging strategies. Leaders orchestrate
speeches to promote their party's agenda (Harris, 2005). To
the extent that leaders orchestrated speeches on the key
issues assessed in this paper, it may be difficult to identify
personal representation. Moreover, speeches are often a tool
used by members whose central issues are not on the legisla-
tive agenda (Rocca and Gordon, 2010), whereas the issues
we considered were very much on the agenda. These factors
makes the presence of even modest findings important.
The religious dynamic of speech participation varies,
and moving forward it is important to consider whether it
varies over time and by party. In the short term, however,
our findings demonstrate that legislators represent diverse
religious policy agendas, and that even unified parties can
be disrupted by "personal representation" operating below
the surface of party labels. We do not suggest Republicans
experienced internecine conflict, but our findings help
explain why party-line voting dropped precipitously in the
short term and fully recovered in the long term. In the short
term, party unity could not be sustained in the face of even
marginal religious variation within the Conference, to the
extent that religious variation is associated with diverse
policy preferences. In the long term, that variation has
diminished as the Conference proportion of Evangelical
Protestants and white Catholics has increased at the expense
of Mainline Protestants. The Republican Conference in the
113 Congress was as conservative and as cohesive as it has
ever been, but roots of this were established 20 years ago.
As the analysis demonstrates, even the most unified party
can be undermined when legislators bring their personal
religious values to bear on the policy process.

2. To identify one-minute speeches, we searched the
Congressional Record using the Sunlight Foundation's Capitol
Words tool available at http://capitolwords.org for instances in
which the chair indicated that a member was recognized to
speak for one minute. We then manually excluded speeches
by individuals that were not members of the Republican
Conference and speeches that were not one-minute speeches.
(These omissions include announcements and speeches made
during legislative business.) Capitol Words downloads the
contents of the Congressional Record daily from the web-
site of the Government Printing Office. While we could have

directly, Capitol Words has a customizable application pro-
gramming interface (API) that allowed us to automate the
searches of the Congressional Record for relevant documents,
dramatically increasing the efficiency of our searches. The
Capitol Words data begin in 1996; accordingly, we do not have
data for the first session of the 104th Congress.
3. This is a deviation from the Policy Agendas Project coding
guidelines, which assign only one major and one subtopic
code per bill. When bills equally address two topics, the
PolicyAgendas Project assigns the bill the numerically lower
of the applicable codes. We adapt this rule for multiple top-
ics: when a speech equally address more than two substan-
tive issues, we assign the two lowest codes.
4. These data are from the Glenmary Research Center, which
aggregates by state and county. John Green reaggregated
these data by congressional district and graciously provided
them to the authors.
