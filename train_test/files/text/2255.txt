Preventive Services Delivery in Patients
With Chronic Illnesses: Parallel Opportuni-
ties Rather Than Competing Obligations
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Whether patients with 1 or more chronic illnesses are more or less
likely to receive recommended preventive services is unclear and an important
public health and health care system issue. We addressed this issue in a large
national practice-based research network (PBRN) that maintains a longitudinal
database derived from electronic health records.
METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study as of October 1, 2011, of the
association between being up to date with 10 preventive services and the preva-
lence of 24 chronic illnesses among 667,379 active patients aged 18 years or
older in 148 member practices in a national PBRN. We used generalized linear
mixed models to assess for the association of being up to date with each preven-
tive service as a function of the patient's number of chronic conditions, adjusted
for patient age and encounter frequency.
RESULTS Of the patients 65.4% had at least 1 of the 24 chronic illnesses. For 9
of the 10 preventive services there were strong associations between the odds
of being up to date and the presence of chronic illness, even after adjustment
for visit frequency and patient age. Odds ratios increased with the number of
chronic conditions for 5 of the preventive services.
CONCLUSIONS Rather than a barrier, the presence of chronic illness was posi-
tively associated with receipt of recommended preventive services in this large
national PBRN. This finding supports the notion that modern primary care prac-
tice can effectively deliver preventive services to the growing number of patients
with multiple chronic illnesses.

INTRODUCTION
It has long been argued that competing demands in the primary care
encounter are barriers to the effective delivery of clinical preventive
services.1 One estimate is that 7.4 hours of a primary care clinician's
workday would be needed to provide services recommended by the US
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF),2 clearly impossible given com-
peting demands for acute care, chronic care, and other responsibilities.
An alternative perspective is that encounters primarily for other rea-
sons, particularly for chronic illnesses that entail frequent clinician con-
tacts, would facilitate delivery of clinical preventive services. Research to
date on this issue has yielded inconsistent findings. A 1997 study showed
that patients with chronic illness were less likely to receive recommended
preventive services,3 as did a more recent report focused only on patients
with diabetes mellitus.4 In contrast, other reports have shown posi-
tive associations between chronic disease comorbidity and osteoporosis
screening,5 and between rheumatoid arthritis and dyslipidemia and osteo-
porosis screening.6

CHRONIC ILLNESS AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES DELIVERY
All existing reports are limited by the number of
practices, patients, preventive services, and chronic
illnesses analyzed. In this report, we analyze the
cross-sectional association between receipt of 10 pre-
ventive services recommended by the USPSTF and
the prevalence of 24 chronic illnesses among 667,379
active patients aged 18 years or older in 148 practices
affiliated with a national primary care practice-based
research network (PBRN).
METHODS
The study was conducted in PPRNet, a PBRN founded
in 1995,7 which now comprises 233 practices in 43
states. Unique among US PBRNs is the PPRNet data-
base, which is derived from the Practice Partner elec-
tronic health record (EHR) (McKesson Corporation)
used in each participating practice. The longitudinal
database contains anonymized demographic and clini-
cal data and is updated quarterly through automated
data extracts.
For this report, we used the PPRNet database
updated as of October 1, 2011. Practices that had
begun to use Practice Partner on or after January 1,
2010, were excluded from the analyses to better assure
adequate time for recording of chronic illnesses and
delivery or recording of prior preventive services.
Practices whose primary specialty was not family prac-
tice or general internal medicine or those with fewer
than 100 active patients aged at least 18 years were
also excluded. Patients were defined as active in the
practice if there was a progress note recorded in the
EHR within 1 year of October 1, 2011.
Demographics, problems, diagnoses, procedures,
vital signs, preventive services, laboratory results, and
progress note titles recorded in the EHR from active
patients were included in the analyses. Data from
problem and diagnoses lists were used to assess the
prevalence of the chronic conditions; all data elements
were used to assess receipt of preventive services.
Because the EHR allows free-text data entry, PPRNet
uses computer algorithms for pattern matching and
expert review to assign International Classification of Dis-
eases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes
to diagnoses, Logical Observation Identifiers Names
and Codes (LOINC) for laboratory data, and an inter-
nal dictionary for other data elements. From audits
conducted in the early phases of these analyses for the
chronic conditions included in this report, we have
determined that, compared with review by a clinician,
our approach has at least 99% sensitivity and 99%
specificity for identification of these diagnoses.
The preventive services studied are all grade A or
B screening recommendations of the USPSTF: screen-
ing for high blood pressure, lipid disorders, cervical
cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, urogenital
chlamydial infection, type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults
with elevated blood pressure, alcohol misuse, depres-
sion, and osteoporosis.8 The 24 chronic conditions
studied represent a broad spectrum of illnesses relevant
to primary care practice and are conditions of priority
for comparative effectiveness research.9,10
The proportion of patients up to date with a given
preventive service was calculated by dividing the num-
ber of patients who had received the service in the rec-
ommended interval by the number of patients eligible
for the service. The prevalence for each chronic condi-
tion studied was calculated by dividing the number of
patients with the condition by the number of active
patients. The total number of chronic conditions (of
the 24 studied) was also determined for each patient.
Encounter frequency was defined for each patient as
the number of progress notes between October 1,
2010, and September 30, 2011.
For each preventive service, we first calculated the
unadjusted percentages of eligible patients who were
up to date for those with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more
chronic illnesses. We then used generalized linear
mixed models (GLMMs)11 to model the up-to-date sta-
tus with the preventive service (yes/no) as a function
of the patient's number of chronic conditions, treating
number of chronic conditions as a categorical variable
with 6 categories (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). All GLMMs incor-
porated logit link functions and accounted for cluster-
ing of patients within practices by means of random
practice effects with compound symmetry error struc-
tures. In essence, the GLMMs served as hierarchical
logistic regression models. Models for each preventive
service were constructed with covariate adjustment for
patient age and encounter frequency. Adjusted odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed
and reported.
RESULTS
One hundred seventy-two practices provided data as
of October 1, 2011. Eight practices that had begun
comprehensive use of Practice Partner on or after
January 1, 2010, were excluded, as were 11 whose
primary specialty was not family practice or general
internal medicine, and 5 because they had fewer than
100 active adult patients. One hundred forty-eight
practices with 667,379 active adult patients remained
in the analytic data set. Specialty distribution among
the 148 practices was 77.0% family practice, 16.2%
internal medicine, and 6.8% combinations of primary
care specialists and other physicians. Among the
patients, 58.2% were female and 41.7% were male; sex

was not recorded in 0.1% of the patients. The age dis-
tribution was as follows: 18 to 34 years 23.8%, 35 to
44 years 15.9%, 45 to 54 years 19.4%, 55 to 64 years
18.8%, 65 to 74 years 12.1%, 75 to 84 years 7.0%, and
85 or more years 3.0%.
Table 1 lists the 24 chronic conditions and the
prevalence of each diagnosis as of October 1, 2011.
Hyperlipidemia and hypertension were the most
prevalent diagnoses, each affecting one-third of the
patients. Among the 667,379 active patients, the pro-
portion with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or more chronic con-
ditions was 34.6%, 20.1%, 14.9%, 11.2%, 7.7%, and
11.5%, respectively.
Table 2 displays the 10 preventive services, the
relevant time and demographic parameters for each,
the number of eligible patients, and percentage up to
date. Almost all eligible patients had a blood pressure
recorded in their EHR. Three-quarters were up to date
with glucose screening for elevated blood pressure and
with cholesterol screening. About one-half of eligible
patients were current with mammography screening
and bone mineral density screening, and just over two-
fifths with any form of colorectal cancer screening
or Papanicolaou smears for cervical cancer screening.
Only 1 in 5 had recorded screening for depression or
at-risk drinking, and 1 in 6 for screening for urogenital
chlamydial infection.
The unadjusted associations between being up
to date with each preventive service and the number
of chronic conditions are depicted in Figure 1. For
each preventive service, there is a curvilinear relation-
ship with the number of chronic conditions, with an
increased likelihood of being up to date with a pre-
ventive service as the number of chronic conditions
increases from 0 to 4 or 5. At that
point, for the most part, the asso-
ciation plateaus, and there are no
further increases in the proportion
of patients up to date with the pre-
ventive service as the number of
chronic conditions increases above
5. Blood pressure measurement
is an exception to the pattern; it
seems to plateau once there is at
least 1 chronic condition.
Table 3 shows the association
between being up to date with
each of the preventive services
and the number of chronic con-
ditions, adjusted for patient age
and encounter frequency. For
each preventive service other
than screening for urogenital
chlamydia, there are strong asso-
ciations between the odds of being up to date and the
presence of chronic illness, even after adjustment for
visit frequency and patient age. Adjusted odds ratios
increase with the number of chronic conditions, most

CHRONIC ILLNESS AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES DELIVERY
prominently for depression screening, but also for
cholesterol, diabetes, colorectal cancer, and bone den-
sity screening.
DISCUSSION
In this study of two-thirds of a million adult patients
from 148 primary care practices across the United
States, we have found strong positive associations
between receipt of clinical preventive services and
the presence of chronic illnesses. These associations
persisted regardless of the number of chronic illnesses.
This finding is in contrast to oft-expressed concerns
that increasing patient complexity (defined as having
more than 1 chronic illness) impedes the delivery of
preventive services because of competing demands.1
Our findings persisted even after adjustment for age
and encounter frequency, suggesting that it is some-
thing in the nature of the care provided to these
patients that accounted for the finding of increased
attention to prevention.
The explanation for our findings is unclear. Most
PPRNet practices have attended PPRNet meetings
and/or participated in PPRNet quality improvement
research projects that emphasize the importance of evi-
dence-based care, team care, and use of EHR decision
support, such as preventive services reminders. PPRNet
also provides quarterly clinical quality reports to mem-
ber practices, which include practice-, provider-, and
patient-level data on the preventive services studied, as
well as other quality indicators for acute and chronic ill-
ness care. It could be that practices, using these reports
as chronic illness registries, may have attended to pre-
ventive services in addition to the chronic illness when
conducting outreach efforts to patients. Such outreach
efforts might not be directed to patients without
chronic illness. It could also be that care management
activities inherent in encounters for chronic illness care,
such as ordering tests and arranging follow-up, provide
the context for provision of preventive services. Indeed,
a direct observation study of primary care clinicians
found that preventive services were delivered during
39% of visits for chronic illness.12
There are several potential limitations of our
report. One is confounding by condition. For example,
that the odds ratios for cholesterol and blood glucose
measurement increased with the number of chronic
conditions could be confounded by several of the most
common chronic conditions, such as diabetes mel-
litus and hyperlipidemia, being themselves indications
for these services. A subanalysis excluding the 79,641
patients with diabetes mellitus, however, did not alter
the strong positive association between blood glucose
measurement for elevated blood pressure and the
number of chronic conditions. Excluding the 220,053
patients with hyperlipidemia attenuated but did not
eliminate the association between screening for total
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and patient
complexity. That the odds of screening for depres-
sion, colorectal cancer, and bone mineral density also
increased with the number of chronic conditions miti-
gates the possibility of confounding being responsible
for most of the observed associations.
As in any secondary analysis, we could not inde-
pendently validate our data sources, the diagnoses,
and preventive services data in the EHRs of patients in
the participating practices. A specific concern relevant
to this limitation is the possibility of information bias,
which might be present if practices or members of
practices were both more diligent in recording chronic
illnesses and receipt of a preventive service. It is
unlikely that this potential bias was responsible for our
study findings for 2 major reasons. First, the observed
associations were strong, which would not have
occurred unless most of the practices were affected
by information bias, an unlikely occurrence. Second,
the observed associations were present for 9 of the 10
preventive services, most of which are documented
in ways other than direct entry, including automated
downloading of laboratory and procedure results.
A final limitation is that, despite the relatively large,
geographically diverse, sample of practices and clini-
cians included in this study, all were users of a single
EHR and voluntary members of a PBRN. The extent
to which the findings from this group of practices can
be generalized across all primary care settings in the
United States and other countries with similar health
care systems is unknown.Despite these limitations, we
believe that our findings support the notion that modern
primary care practices, facilitated by tools like EHRs
and joined in learning networks such as PBRNs, can
overcome competing demands and effectively deliver
preventive services to the growing number of patients
with multiple chronic illnesses.13 Epidemiologic studies
suggest that principles of the patient-centered medical
home facilitate preventive services delivery.14,15 Empiri-
cal evidence points to the positive impact on preventive
services delivery of EHR-based reminders and standing
orders for nonclinician staff,16 as well as multicomponent
interventions using audit and feedback, academic detail-
ing, and practice facilitation.16,17 Whether these strate-
gies have a similar impact among patients with multiple
chronic illnesses is a subject for future research.
