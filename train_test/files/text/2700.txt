Previous studies have reported evidence that indicates differences between Western
and East Asian cultures in anger regulation and its psychological consequences.
However, many of these studies have focused on a specific anger regulation strategy
and its relation with a psychological consequence. Here, we developed an integrated
model that can comprehensively examine three different anger regulation strategies
(anger suppression, expression, and control), independent and interdependent self-
construals as the psychological antecedent, and life satisfaction as the psychological
consequence. We estimated the model using large samples of American and Japanese
adults to examine the associations between the two self-construals, three anger
regulation strategies, and life satisfaction. We compared the difference in the patterns of
relationships among the key constructs between the American and Japanese samples.
The results confirmed previously suggested cultural differences while also discovering
new culturally different paths. The results generally suggest that individual-level self-
construals matter more when anger is a culturally condoned emotion (vs. condemned).
The implications and limitations of the integrated model are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Research into emotion regulation has increased dramatically in the past couple of decades (Gross,
2014). Initial research focused more on individual differences in the use of different emotion
regulation strategies and showed that effective regulation of key emotions, such as anger and
pride, in everyday life mattered to one's life satisfaction (Gross, 2007). More recently, the focus has
been extended to cultural differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies as well as to how
their relationships with the key antecedents and consequences systematically differ across cultures
(Mauss and Butler, 2010; Mesquita et al., 2014).
In recent years, there has been an increase in studies examining how one's culturally motivated
goals influence emotion regulation strategy as an antecedent (e.g., Park et al., 2013) and how a
specific emotion regulation strategy affects one's well-being as a consequence (e.g., Kitayama et al.,
2015). However, there is a limited amount of studies that comprehensively explore the relationships
between emotion regulation strategy and its antecedents (or moderators) and consequences (Butler
et al., 2007).
This paper closes a significant gap in the literature by proposing an integrated model that
can systematically examine three different approaches of anger regulation (i.e., anger suppression,

anger expression, and anger control), independent and
interdependent self-construals as the psychological antecedent,
and life satisfaction as the psychological consequence. We
estimated the model using large representative samples of
American and Japanese adults to examine the associations
between the two self-construals, three anger regulation
approaches, and life satisfaction, and to compare the systematic
patterns between the USA and Japan.
Anger Regulation as a Mediator of
Cultural Self-Construals on Life
Satisfaction
Independent self-construal refers to a self-conception that
values autonomy and independence of individuals, whereas
interdependent self-construal refers to that values connectedness
and interdependence (e.g., Markus and Kitayama, 1991).
Theoretically, each individual possesses both while the balance
differs across situations within an individual, across individuals
within a culture, and across cultures on average (Benet-Martinez
et al., 2002; Oyserman et al., 2002). Life satisfaction refers to
a judgment process, in which individuals assess the quality
of their lives based on their own unique set of criteria (Shin
and Johnson, 1978; Pavot and Diener, 1993). It is regarded as
a key manifestation of self-construal among other well-being
related constructs such as affective well-being (Markus and
Kitayama, 1991; Kitayama et al., 2007), and recently, some studies
suggested that the effects of self-construals on life satisfaction
were mediated by anger regulation. As a specific example, Novin
et al. (2014) showed that emotion expression, along with social
support provision, mediated the effects of self-construals on life
satisfaction both in the USA and Japan. In the following, we
argue that anger regulation strategies mediate the effects of self-
construals on life satisfaction and that they do differ between the
USA and Japan.
Kitayama and Markus (1994) and Kitayama et al. (2004)
suggested that self-construals may critically shape the ways
in which individuals regulate their emotions. They claimed
that emotion regulation strategies may be culturally reinforced
to serve either an interdependent or independent goal. Thus,
cultural models of being provide a theoretical foundation
for examining the cultural differences in emotion regulation.
Mesquita et al. (2014) argued that emotions are culturally
afforded to the extent that they benefit the central concerns of
the culture. Specifically using anger as a concrete example, they
argued that one's anger implies an attitude of not accepting the
situation, an assessment that one has a relatively high level of
control over other people in the situation (Frijda et al., 1989),
and a willingness to influence these other people so that they
accommodate one's own wishes, goals, and values (Stein et al.,
1993). Anger is a well-studied emotion, especially in cross-
cultural contexts, presumably because it is an emotion that
highlights the independent model of the self, which is dominant
in Western cultures, including North America. That is, anger
marks individual entitlement and sets clear boundaries, and is
thus beneficial in achieving the central goals of the American
culture of competitive individualism (Boiger et al., 2013a).
According to Kitayama et al. (2004), the culture may shape
emotional experience via collective and personal processes. In
contrast to the independent model of the self, Markus and
Kitayama (1991) argued that the interdependent model of the
self, which is dominant in East Asian cultures, emphasizes
connectedness with other people; the self becomes meaningful
only in the larger context of social relationships. Thus, although
each of the self-construals would function within an individual
similarly across cultures, the directions of the primary concern
in social contexts could be opposite between the two types of
culture.
Specifically, Boiger et al. (2013b) showed that anger was
thought to be a culturally condoned emotion in the USA but a
culturally condemned emotion in Japan, and thus the perceived
frequency of anger situations (i.e., a situation that elicits anger)
was higher in the USA than in Japan. If anger is a culturally
condoned emotion, whether or not to regulate it is likely to
be up to individual values-based preference in the context
of USA cultural group. In contrast, if anger is a culturally
condemned emotion, it is likely to be socially or structurally
regulated so that it will not be expressed in order to best
maintain social harmony in the context of Japanese culture. As
a result, individuals may not have much freedom to engage in
particular anger regulation strategies based on their own level
of independent or interdependent self-construal. To support
this view of distinguishing between different levels of anger
regulation, Mesquita et al. (2014) argued that culture should
be defined both at the level of the individual and at the level
of the social environment and showed that the broadly defined
culture plays an important role in emotion regulation. Similarly,
De Leersnyder et al. (2013) identified relational co-regulation
and socially structured cultural norms, in addition to individual
tendencies, as sources of emotion regulation in a cultural context.
Following Spielberger (1996), in this study, we consider three
strategies of anger regulation: anger-in, anger-out, and anger
control. Each of the three anger regulation strategies is reviewed
below in terms of its relationship with self-construals and life
satisfaction, in both independent and interdependent cultural
contexts, in order to further explore hypotheses.
Anger-in/Anger Suppression
Anger-in or anger suppression, is defined as the tendency to turn
one's anger inward, implying anger regulation by suppression
(Greenglass, 1996). It is also regarded as the frequency with which
angry feelings are experienced but not expressed (Spielberger,
1996). It is related to conflict avoidance, guilt, irritability,
decreased life satisfaction, rumination, and depressive symptoms
(Kopper and Epperson, 1996; Bridewell and Chang, 1997; Gross
and John, 2003; Martin and Dahlen, 2007; McRae et al., 2011;
English et al., 2012). Those who can suppress their angry feelings
also have a stronger perception of inadequate social support
(Palfai and Hart, 1997). Therefore, anger suppression may be
related to mental health problems that lead to lower levels of life
satisfaction.
Eng et al. (2013, Unpublished) showed that cultural self-
construals mediate the cultural differences in the suppression
of some emotions. Suppressing emotion basically goes against
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 768
Akutsu et al. Anger Regulation on Life Satisfaction
mainstream American beliefs that put a high value on
authenticity (English et al., 2012) and view high arousal
emotions as ideal (Tsai et al., 2006). Moreover, since anger is
a condoned emotion in the independence dominant American
culture, in which it is culturally appropriate to express anger
to communicate one's independence to a larger extent (Boiger
et al., 2013a,b), a more highly independent self-construal would
inhibit the use of anger suppression to maintain the level of
life satisfaction. For the same reason, even those who are high
in interdependent self-construal would choose anger control
rather than anger suppression to maintain relational harmony.
As discussed above, although cross-ethnicity studies in the USA
suggest a positive impact of interdependence and a negative
impact of independence on anger suppression (e.g., Butler et al.,
2007), in Japan where anger is condemned and not expressing
negative emotion is a rather strict social norm, we argue that,
regardless of their self-construal, people in general are likely
to suppress anger in social situations where relational harmony
matters and that the impact of self-construals are small.
Although, previous studies suggest the negative impact of
anger suppression on life satisfaction in Japan (e.g., Eng et al.,
2013, Unpublished), to our knowledge, there is no evidence
or theoretical insights that can be used to predict cross-
cultural differences in the degree of the negative impact of
anger suppression on life satisfaction. In Japan where anger is
condemned, people would be used to suppressing anger and
thus it would have less of a negative impact on life satisfaction,
while people would feel more stress if they are forcibly restrained
to keep anger inside by structural norms no matter what their
individual values are. Thus, we will make no a priori prediction
regarding the cultural differences in the degree of negative impact
of anger suppression on life satisfaction.
Anger-out/Anger Expression
Anger-out, or anger expression, is an emotion regulation
strategy of expressing one's anger outwardly, usually directing
the response at the target of one's anger (Spielberger, 1996).
People in the independent American culture are more likely to
express anger freely, or are even encouraged to do so, when
they feel frustration and anger to show culturally sanctioned
independence (Mesquita et al., 2014). Therefore, independent
self-construal is expected to positively affect anger expression
in the USA. Even in the independent USA culture, however,
interdependent self-construal is expected to negatively affect
anger expression in order to avoid disrupting relational harmony
(Butler et al., 2007; Novin et al., 2014). The previous literature
suggests mixed effects of anger expression on life satisfaction
in the USA, it is difficult to make a clear prediction. See, for
example, Mesquita et al. (2014) for positive effects and Bridewell
and Chang (1997) for negative effects.
Evidence from Japan seems more complicated regarding anger
expression. On the one hand, anger expression due to frustration
is condemned in Japan in order to better maintain culturally
valued social harmony (Boiger et al., 2013b). Therefore, higher
interdependent self-construal is likely to negatively affect anger
expression in Japan, while the positive impact of independent
self-construal may be rather limited to expressing anger that
reflects frustrated experience due to the strong cultural norm of
interdependence (Kitayama et al., 2015).
On the other hand, in addition to anger expression reflecting
frustration, previous studies suggest that there is another
motivation of anger expression, which is to display dominance,
privilege, and authority (Hurd and Enquist, 2001; Tiedens, 2001).
While both the frustration and dominance facets of anger were
universally recognized, Park et al. (2013) demonstrated that
the dominance facet of anger expression was more prominent
than the other frustration-reflecting facets of anger expression
in Japan whereas the opposite was the case in the USA.
Specifically, Park et al. (2013) demonstrated that those with
lower subjective socioeconomic status were more likely to express
their anger among USA samples whereas those with higher
objective socioeconomic status were more likely to express their
anger among Japanese samples, and that the effects in the USA
were mediated by frustration while the effects in Japan were
mediated by decision authority. Kitayama et al. (2015) extended
the findings of Park et al. (2013) and further demonstrated
that expression of the dominance facet of anger was positively
associated with various health outcomes in Japan whereas the
expression of the frustration facet of anger was negatively
associated with various health outcomes in the USA.
While such previous research has demonstrated that
independent self-construal positively affects the frustration facet
of anger expression in the USA, to our knowledge no empirical
evidence is available regarding which of the two self-construals,
if any, affects the dominance facet of anger expression in
interdependent dominant cultures. It is anticipated, however,
that higher independent self-construal will positively affect the
dominance facet of anger expression because it is based on an
independence-oriented motivation to differentiate oneself from
others by affirming one's dominant and privileged status.
Due to this multi-faceted nature of anger expression in
Japan, its impact on life satisfaction is not clear. Thus, we
will explore the data without a priori prediction regarding this.
Similarly, it is hard to make a priori predictions regarding the
cultural differences in the degree of the association between anger
expression and both its antecedents as well as its consequence.
Anger Control
Anger control refers to an emotion regulation strategy of
controlling anger internally, staying calm, and not expressing
it outwardly (Spielberger, 1996). While it is similar to anger
suppression, in that anger is not expressed externally, anger
control would involve some kind of cognitive processes such as
reappraisal (Gross, 1998, 2014). Reappraisal refers to the ability
to monitor and prevent the experience or expression of anger by
cognitively changing the feeling of anger (Bridewell and Chang,
1997). Thus, it would encourage adaptive functioning and help to
promote and recognize the utility of efforts to adjust the intensity
or duration of the emotion. It may not result in eliminating the
emotion or escaping it altogether (Gratz and Tull, 2010; McRae
et al., 2011; English et al., 2012; Roberton et al., 2014).
Using samples of young American adults, Bridewell and
Chang (1997) demonstrated that (1) anger suppression, followed
by a lack of anger control, played a key role in predicting
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 768
Akutsu et al. Anger Regulation on Life Satisfaction
depressive and anxious symptoms; (2) anger expression, along
with gender, played a key role in predicting depressive symptoms
but not anxious symptoms; and (3) anger expression, followed by
a lack of anger control and anger suppression, played a key role
in predicting hostility. In the USA culture, high interdependent
self-construal would be strongly associated with high anger
control as the best solution for achieving the individually held
value of interdependence (i.e., maintaining relational harmony)
while minimizing culturally salient negative consequences of
anger suppression (e.g., high anxiety and depressive symptoms).
However, although saving relational harmony would promote life
satisfaction while avoiding the negative impact of suppressing
anger, compromising one's independence would lower life
satisfaction of people in the independence dominant American
culture. Because these mixed effects would cancel each other out,
it is expected that the impact of anger control on life satisfaction
in the USA may not be substantially large while it is hard
to predict its direction a priori. Contrary to interdependence,
independence would inhibit anger control as it inhibits anger
suppression. However, due to its limited negative consequence, if
any, the negative impact of independence would be rather small.
As discussed, in Japan where anger is condemned and not
expressing negative emotion is a social norm, regardless of their
self-construal, people in general are likely to suppress anger in
social situations where relational harmony matters. Moreover,
there are no previous studies, to our knowledge, that indicate a
systematic influence of either independence or interdependence
on the choice between anger suppression and anger control.
Thus, we do not predict any substantial impact of both self-
construals on anger control in Japan. No matter who chooses
it, however, anger control is predicted to positively relate to
life satisfaction in the interdependent dominant Japanese culture
where compromising showing one's independence may not be as
valued as maintaining relational harmony.
Model
A graphical presentation of the conceptual model that links the
aforementioned factors is provided in Figure 1.
In summary, in the USA culture where anger is condoned,
it is expected that independent self-construal will be negatively
related to anger suppression but positively related to anger
expression, and will have a limited negative impact on anger
control, if any. In contrast, it is expected that interdependent
self-construal will be negatively related to anger expression
but positively related to anger control, and will have only a
small negative impact on anger suppression, if any. Regarding
the outcome, it is expected that anger suppression will be
negatively related to life satisfaction. However, no clear prediction
regarding the impact of anger expression and anger control on
life satisfaction will be made because each of them appears to
have opposing effects. While the impact of anger control on life
satisfaction is not expected to be large anyway, it is hard to predict
its direction a priori.
In the Japanese culture where anger is condemned, it is
expected that independent self-construal will be positively related
to anger expression, yet will have rather a small positive impact,
if any, on anger suppression or anger control. In contrast,
interdependent self-construal will be negatively related to anger
expression, yet will have rather a small negative impact on anger
suppression or anger control. Anger suppression is predicted to
be negatively related to life satisfaction, whereas anger control is
predicted to be positively related to life satisfaction. We made no
a priori prediction regarding the impact of anger expression on
life satisfaction due to its mixed impact.
Regarding the cultural difference in the degree of association
among factors, we predicted that the negative impact of
independence on anger suppression and the positive impact of
interdependence on anger control will be larger in the USA
and that the positive impact of anger control on life satisfaction

will be larger in Japan. We empirically explored the cultural
differences of other associations among factors without making
clear predictions.
Based on the empirical evidence from previous cross-
cultural studies using similar factors (e.g., Park et al., 2013;
Novin et al., 2014; Kitayama et al., 2015), we assumed and
established the measurement equivalence of each construct (i.e.,
independent/interdependent self-construal, anger-in, anger-out,
anger control, and life satisfaction) between the two national
samples. We anticipated that the cultural moderation effects
demonstrated in the previous studies would be reflected in
different patterns of relationship between emotion regulation, its
antecedents, and its consequence in the American and Japanese
samples.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
We used a subset of the Midlife Development in the United States
(MIDUS) survey and the corresponding Midlife Development
in Japan (MIDJA) survey conducted in 2008 to estimate our
model (for a more comprehensive review of the MIDUS and
MIDJA, please refer, for example, to Park et al., 2013). For the
USA sample, we used the MIDUS Project 4 of the second wave
of the MIDUS (i.e., MIDUS II) conducted in 2004. MIDUS II
is the longitudinal follow-up data from the MIDUS I that was
conducted in 1995 and 1996. The MIDUS II used a subsample
of participants (N = 1,255) from the original MIDUS study
(MIDUS I). The final USA sample consisted of 542 males
and 713 females, aged from 35 to 86 years-old (M = 57.32,
SD = 11.5). For the Japanese sample, the MIDJA survey was
used (N = 1,027). The final Japanese sample consisted of
505 males and 522 females aged 30­79 years-old (M = 54.3,
SD = 14.1). The t-test of age between the USA and Japanese
cultures was conducted (t = 5.64, df = 2280, p < 0.001,
d = 0.23). The chi-square test of gender and culture was also
performed (2
= 8.15, df = 1, p < 0.01, r = 0.06). Even
though these differences are statistically significant, effect sizes
are small. "Japanese respondents completed self-administered
questionnaires; the Japanese version was back-translated and
adjusted multiple times by native speakers to generate analogous
meaning" (Curhan et al., 2014).
Table 1 shows the sample size, mean, and standard deviation
for each variable in the USA and Japan. As described above, it
should be noted that MIDUS and MIDJA samples are not truly
a national representative sample although they are much more
nationally representative than rather limited student samples.
Most notably, they are biased toward older adults. It would be
a part of the reason for higher mean of interdependence in the
USA.
Measurement Instruments
The Self-Construal Scale (Singelis, 1994) was used to measure
interdependent and intdependent self-construals. Responses
to the 10 interdependent and 7 independent items were
measured on a seven-point scale, ranging from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA) was conducted to examine our proposed model and
test the internal consistency of measurement items. As a
result, some items were dropped. The remaining items include
"It is important for me to maintain harmony or smooth
relationships within my group" for interdependence and
"Speaking up is not a problem for me" for independence
(see Table 2 for remaining items with path coefficients).
Cronbach's alphas of interdependence were 0.60 (USA) and 0.60
(Japan) and those of independence were 0.63 (US) and 0.62
(Japan).
Anger regulation was measured using anger-in, anger-out,
and anger control subscales of the State-Trait Anger Expression
Inventory, each of which refers to the extent to which "one
can keep angry feelings inside or can suppress anger or furious
feelings," "one can express feelings of anger, furious feelings, or
lose control," and "one can control anger or furious feelings using
physical or verbal expression and communication," respectively
(STAXI; Spielberger, 1996). Responses to the eight anger-in, eight
anger-out, and four anger control items were measured on a
four-point scale, ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost
always). The CFA was conducted to examine our proposed model
and to test the internal consistency of the measurement items.
One item was dropped. Sample items are as follows: in general
when I feel angry or furious, I withdraw from people (anger-
in); I express my anger (anger-out); and I control my temper
(anger control). See Table 3 for all the remaining items with
path coefficients. Cronbach's alphas of anger-in were 0.82 (USA)
and 0.75 (Japan), those of anger-out were 0.77 (USA) and 0.80

(Japan), and those of anger control were 0.83 (USA) and 0.78
(Japan).
Life satisfaction was measured by the Satisfaction with Life
Scale (Pavot and Diener, 1993). Four-point scale, ranging from
1 (not at all important) to 4 (extremely important), was used.
The CFA was conducted to examine our proposed model and test
the internal consistency of the measurement items. No items was
dropped. The remaining five items include "I am satisfied with
my life" (see Table 4). Cronbach's alphas of life satisfaction were
0.88 (USA) and 0.90 (Japan).
RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
Before examining the relationships between the key constructs,
we conducted a CFA in the structural equation modeling
(SEM) of all of the factors in order to examine the factorial
commonalities between the two samples (i.e., the USA and Japan)
with equality constraints (i.e., assuming that the covariance
among all of the factors). Using AMOS 18 (Arbuckle, 2009),
SEM was conducted to examine two models: an unconstrained

model, in which no path coefficients were constrained to be
equal for both cultures, and a constrained model, in which
all path coefficients were constrained to be equal for both
cultures. Because the model fit index score with the constrained
model with all path coefficients are not significant different
( 2
= 7.01, df = 30, n.s.). This can confirm the cross-cultural
similarities. There were covariates among all latent variables
in both models. As suggested by Raykov et al. (1991), the
SEM results were evaluated using two model fit indexes: the
comparative fit index (CFI) and the root-mean square-error of
approximation (RMSEA). Fit indices of the unconstrained model
were as follows: 2
= 4824.77, df = 1090, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.85,
and RMSEA = 0.039; and for the constrained model were as
follows: 2
= 5143.19, df = 1118, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.84, and
RMSEA = 0.040. Model fit indices over 0.95 and an RMSEA of
0.06 or less are regarded as indicative of good model fit (Bollen,
1989; Bentler, 1990; Hu and Bentler, 1999). The RMSEA values
in this study indicate that both models have a very good fit to
the data. Although, the unconstrained model was better than the
constrained model in terms of the CFI, there were no substantial
differences in fit between the two models; both were a very
good fit in terms of RMSEA values. We decided to adopt the
constrained model (i.e., with factor equivalence across the two
cultural groups) as the baseline for the subsequent analyses, as
our main interest was in determining how the associations of the
latent variables differ between the two cultures.
Table 5 shows the correlation matrix of the key variables as
well as age and gender. The coefficients were estimated using
the constrained model of the CFA, and were all significant at
p < 0.005, if not p < 0.001, except for the correlation between
independent self-construal and anger-out in the USA, and the
correlations in Japan between independent self-construal and
anger-in; interdependent self-construal and both anger-in and
anger-out; anger-out and anger control; and anger control and
life satisfaction.
Main Analyses
Our intention was to develop an integrated model with the three
types of anger regulation strategies (anger-in, anger-out, anger
control) serving as mediators between self-construals and life
satisfaction. We conducted a path analysis to test the integrated
model as it relates to the effects of self-construals and anger
regulation strategies on life satisfaction. A path analysis was
conducted in which all path coefficients were constrained to
be equal for both cultures. Fit indices of the model were as
follows: 2
= 5064.38, df = 1118, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.84, and
RMSEA = 0.039.
As shown in Figure 2, for the USA participants, independent
self-construal was negatively related to anger-in,  = -0.31,
p < 0.01, positively related to anger-out,  = 0.13, p < 0.01,
and did not directly relate to anger control,  = -0.02,

To address the cultural differences and similarities between
the USA and Japanese samples for the same parameters in the
proposed model, critical ratio tests were conducted at the level of
p < 0.05. The results revealed the culturally similar and culturally
different processes in the path model (see Figure 3).
The culturally different processes between the USA and
Japanese samples reflected the effect of independent self-
construal on anger-in and anger-out, of interdependent self-
construal on anger control, and of anger-in and anger-out
on life satisfaction. More specifically, the negative association
of independent self-construal with anger-in was significantly
larger in the USA sample than in the Japanese sample,
whereas its positive association with anger-out was significantly
larger in the Japanese sample than in the USA sample. The
positive association of interdependent self-construal with anger
control was significantly larger in the USA sample than in the
Japanese sample. The negative association of anger-in and the
positive association of anger-out with life satisfaction were both
significantly larger in the Japanese sample than in the USA
sample.
Processes that were culturally common (including processes
that were not significant in both cultures) were observed
in the relationship between independent and interdependent
self-construals, the association of independent self-construal
with anger control and life satisfaction, and of interdependent
self-construal with anger-in, anger-out, and life satisfaction,
as well as that of anger control with life satisfaction. More
specifically, for both cultures, there was a significantly positive
relationship between independent and interdependent self-
construals, as well as positive associations of interdependent
self-construal and anger control with life satisfaction, whereas
the association of interdependent self-construal with anger-out
was significantly negative. The association of independent self-
construal with anger control and life satisfaction, as well as that of
interdependent self-construal with anger-in, was not significant
either culture.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
While we did not make clear predictions for some associations,
especially regarding cultural differences in the association
strength, the results, which were based on significance tests,

generally supported our proposed path model. As expected for
the USA sample regarding the antecedent of anger regulation,
independent self-construal negatively related to anger-in and
positively related to anger-out. There was no significant relation
between independence and anger control, which was no surprise
because we did not make a strong prediction.
As expected for the Japanese sample, both anger-in and
anger control were not significantly associated with either
interdependent or independent self-construal. These results
suggest the limited impact of individually held self-construals
on regulating anger within oneself in Japan. While anger-in
and anger control are negatively correlated, and may be used
as exclusive alternatives by the American participants, they are
positively correlated in the Japanese participants, and thus may
be used as equivalent substitutes.
While both the individual-level difference and the social-
level difference are rooted in cultural manifestations, they are
not the same and have a different impact. Specifically, their
impact on life satisfaction would be different even though they
result in the same anger regulation strategy. Although we did
not explicitly predict this, because little has been known about
how the source of anger regulation interacts with culture and
alters the impact of a particular anger regulation strategy on
life satisfaction, our results indicated that the cross-culturally
common significant negative impact of anger-in was even
stronger in the Japanese sample than in the USA sample. One
account for this unexpectedly stronger negative association of
anger-in for the Japanese sample is that it was due to the social
norm's coercive force making people conform to suppress anger
for the sake of social harmony regardless of one's individually held
cultural self-construals, even if one is individually holding very
strong independent self-construal.
The positive association of anger control with life satisfaction
was significant only in the Japanese sample while there was no
significant difference in the strength of the impact between the
USA and Japanese samples. Anger control involves cognitively
effortful change or reappraisal (Gross and John, 2003; Gross,
2014). Anger control, as specified by Spielberger (1996) and used
in this study, comes only after anger is felt. However, given that
individually held self-construals have no effect on anger control,
anger control by reappraisal could possibly be more automatic,
and thus less effortful and stressful for Japanese participants than
for American participants (Mauss et al., 2007, 2008).
Consistent with our prediction, anger-out was significantly
positively associated with independent self-construal and
negatively associated with interdependent self-construal in the
Japanese sample, just as in the USA sample. However, it was
surprising that the positive association of independent self-
construal was significantly stronger in the Japanese sample than
in the USA sample. Combined with the result that the positive
association of anger-out with life satisfaction was significant
in the Japanese sample, higher independent self-construal
seemed to be associated with more frequent use of "anger-out
privilege" in the Japanese sample (Kitayama et al., 2015). For
the USA sample, anger-out was not significantly related to
life satisfaction, presumably due to the more complex mixed
effects of showing independence, venting frustration, destroying
relational harmony, and displaying authority (Park et al., 2013;
Mesquita et al., 2014; Kitayama et al., 2015). As discussed,
whereas anger expression in terms of venting frustration reflects
a frustrating experience, and thus links to lower life satisfaction,
anger expression in terms of displaying authority reflects one's
dominance over others, and thus links to higher life satisfaction.
Moreover, the former is more prominent in the USA whereas the
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 768
Akutsu et al. Anger Regulation on Life Satisfaction
latter is more prominent in Japan (Park et al., 2013; Kitayama
et al., 2015). Although this "multi-faceted anger mechanism" was
not directly examined, our results are at least consistent with its
prediction.
This study explored the overall mechanism of how two types
of self-construal (i.e., independent and interdependent) and three
strategies of anger regulation (i.e., anger-in, anger-out, and anger
control) relate to life satisfaction. It provided evidence that anger
regulation partially mediates the relationships between cultural
self-construals and life satisfaction. We found a significant
relation of interdependent self-construal to anger-out and life
satisfaction for both cultures, and to anger control only for
the USA. While previous studies identified some antecedents to
depression, such as worry and rumination (e.g., Hong, 2007),
and suggest its link to life satisfaction, this study was the first
to explicitly link anger regulation strategies to life satisfaction.
Our results demonstrated systematic cultural differences in the
process. Specifically, two out of three pathways from anger
regulation to life satisfaction were significantly different and
three out of six pathways from self-construal to anger regulation
strategies were significantly different between the two cultures.
More importantly, this study increases our theoretical
understanding of the factors that feed into life satisfaction across
different cultural contexts. In particular, it suggests that future
models of emotion regulation strategies and their consequences
should pay more attention to individually held self-construals as
antecedents because these self-views tend to serve as antecedents
of other cultural and individual values and behaviors that
ultimately feed into happiness and life satisfaction. The findings
also indicate that closely examining the effects of individually
held self-construals would provide more insight into other
cultural factors at a different level, such as cultural norms
and social processes. We believe that our results provide new
insights into the differential impacts of individual-level and
social/structural-level cultural antecedents of anger regulation
strategies on life satisfaction between two cultures.
Limitations and Directions for Future
Research
First, as our model is correlation, one should be cautious in
drawing conclusions about the causal relationships between
self-construals, anger regulation strategies, and life satisfaction.
Further experimental research should be conducted in both
cultural groups to explore their causal relationships. Moreover,
longitudinal studies would provide insight not only into the
direction of the causal relationships but also into the change
over time in the same individuals. Second, our data is limited
to middle-aged to older adults. With respect to the level of self-
construal, for example, Japanese participants reported higher
levels of interdependence than independence, whereas American
participants did not differ in their level of the two self-construals.
Perhaps this age group is more concerned with its in-group
members (e.g., family) compared to younger Americans, while
at the same time still valuing independence. Without further
replication with younger adults, we cannot be certain how much
the pathways to life satisfaction uncovered in the present study
are valid within a culture. Third, our study samples were limited
to participants in the USA and Japan. To investigate wider
cultural variations, data must be collected from different locations
encompassing diverse cultures. Fourth, the measurement of all
of the constructs in this study is by self-report method. Thus,
collecting information from various sources and using different
measurements in future studies would be helpful. Finally, yet
importantly, our study focuses on anger regulation but we
believe that examining other emotions will provide synergetic
value. For example, examining the regulation of shame, which
is condemned in the USA but condoned in Japan (Boiger et al.,
2013b), would complementally validate our anger-based results.
In some cultures, including the USA, expression may be
fairly undifferentiated (e.g., one feels simply bad, including anger,
disgust, being upset, and sad). In contrast, in Japan, expression
of anger may be more granular (e.g., anger may be specific to
situation A, but not situation B; see Grossmann et al., 2015).
Further research is needed to account for cross-cultural and
individual variance in emotional complexity measures.
CONCLUSION
This study explored the proposed model using large
representative samples of American and Japanese adults to
examine the associations between the two self-construals, three
anger regulation strategies (anger suppression, anger expression,
and anger control), and life satisfaction. This study confirmed
cultural differences while also discovering new culturally
different paths. In the USA sample, there was no significant
relation between independence and anger control. By contrast,
in Japanese sample, these results indicate the limited impact
of individually held self-construals on regulating anger within
oneself in Japan. While anger-in and anger control are negatively
correlated with independence, and may be used as exclusive
alternatives by the American participants, they are positively
correlated among the Japanese participants, and thus may be
used as equivalent substitutes. Moreover, our findings should
have the important implications for health care settings as other
contexts. Interventions attempt to reduce or relieve negative
affect, although essential in some contexts, may not be universally
desired or helpful.

followed the recommendations by Fischer et al. (2004). We
conducted within-culture standardization, and then, conducted
the CFA using the within-culture standardized scores. We
compared the fit indices and the path coefficients between the
CFA models using unstandardized scores and the CFA models
using within-culture standardized scores and concluded that the
two models are almost equivalent each other.
