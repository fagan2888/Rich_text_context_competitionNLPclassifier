Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein-Expressing
Glia in the Mouse Lung

Abstract
Autonomic nerves regulate important functions in visceral organs, including the lung. The postganglionic portion of these
nerves is ensheathed by glial cells known as non-myelinating Schwann cells. In the brain, glia play important functional roles in
neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and maintenance of the blood brain barrier. Similarly, enteric glia are now known to
have analogous roles in gastrointestinal neurotransmission, inflammatory response, and barrier formation. In contrast to this,
very little is known about the function of glia in other visceral organs. Like the gut, the lung forms a barrier between airborne
pathogens and the bloodstream, and autonomic lung innervation is known to affect pulmonary inflammation and lung
function. Lung glia are described as non-myelinating Schwann cells but their function is not known, and indeed no transgenic
tools have been validated to study them in vivo. The primary goal of this research was, therefore, to investigate the rela-
tionship between non-myelinating Schwann cells and pulmonary nerves in the airways and vasculature and to validate existing
transgenic mouse tools that would be useful for studying their function. We focused on the glial fibrillary acidic protein
promoter, which is a cognate marker of astrocytes that is expressed by enteric glia and non-myelinating Schwann cells. We
describe the morphology of non-myelinating Schwann cells in the lung and verify that they express glial fibrillary acidic protein
and S100, a classic glial marker. Furthermore, we characterize the relationship of non-myelinating Schwann cells to pulmonary
nerves. Finally, we report tools for studying their function, including a commercially available transgenic mouse line.

Introduction
In the lung, over 90% of all nerves are unmyelinated
(Jammes et al., 1982) and are associated with non-
myelinating Schwann cells, also called Remak cells. Non-
myelinating Schwann cells in the lung were first described
in 1957 (Agostoni et al., 1957), and electron microscopy
studies of lung innervation consistently demonstrate
a close association between these cells and the axons of
pulmonary nerves (Cook and King, 1970; Fillenz, 1970;
Hung et al., 1972; Fox et al., 1980; Jammes et al., 1982;
Pack et al., 1984; Sparrow et al., 1999).
Autonomic pulmonary nerves regulate airway func-
tion and consist of cholinergic parasympathetic, adrener-
gic sympathetic, and non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic
(NANC) branches (Downing and Lee, 1980; Nadel and
Barnes, 1984; Belvisi, 2002). Preganglionic autonomic
fibers are myelinated, while the postganglionic portion
is unmyelinated. As with other visceral organs,
parasympathetic ganglia are found within the lung and
sympathetic ganglia are extrapulmonary (Purves and
Lichtman, 1978; Loewy, 1981; Strack et al., 2002;
Hanani, 2010).
The autonomic nervous system regulates a variety of
pulmonary functions such as airway diameter via bron-
chial smooth muscle and vascular tone, mucus secretion,
and chemosensation of gases (Undem and Nassenstein,
2009; Kc and Martin, 2010). The non-adrenergic, non-
cholinergic system directly innervates bronchial smooth

muscle and has both excitatory and inhibitory effects,
which result in bronchoconstriction and bronchodilation,
respectively (Stretton, 1991; Belvisi, 2002). More recently,
it has been recognized that the pulmonary nerves also
play a role in regulation of the inflammatory response.
Inflammatory cells express nicotinic and muscarinic cho-
linergic, and a and b adrenergic receptors and the release
of autonomic neurotransmitters can have pro- or anti-
inflammatory effects depending on which receptors are
stimulated (Verhein et al., 2009). Sympathetic nerve
activity has been implicated in poststroke or traumatic
brain injury immunosuppression and subsequent pneu-
monia (Prass et al., 2003, 2006; Sykora et al., 2015).
The mechanisms behind neural regulation of the inflam-
matory response in the lung and possible participation by
non-myelinating Schwann cells have not been elucidated.
However, it is likely that non-myelinating Schwann
cells are important participants in pulmonary neural
responses. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, enteric glia
have been shown to play important roles in the formation
and maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier,
neurotransmission and immune response, and their dys-
function has been linked to inflammatory GI pathology
(Bush et al., 1998; Cabarrocas et al., 2003; Gulbransen
and Sharkey, 2012; Neunlist et al., 2012). There are sev-
eral types of enteric glia, of which the intramuscular glia
are most similar to non-myelinating Schwann cells in
morphology and function (Gulbransen and Sharkey,
2012). All enteric glial types originate from a common
population of neural crest progenitor cells that migrate
to the GI tract during development and differentiate into
either neurons or glia (Laranjeira et al., 2011).
Similarly, in the lung, both myelinating and non-mye-
linating Schwann cells arise from neural crest precursors
that migrate from the esophagus into the mouse lung at
embryonic day 10.5, accompanying the progression of
peripheral nerves (Deal et al., 2006). In the developing
human airways, a network of ganglia and nerve trunks
accompanied by Schwann cells can be found by the
middle of the first trimester (Sparrow et al., 1999). The
calcium-binding protein S100, a classic glial marker, has
been used to describe glia of the developing human
respiratory tract (Sparrow et al., 1999) and adult lungs
of several other mammals (Sheppard et al., 1983).
However, very little is known about the anatomy, other
cell-specific markers, or the function of non-myelinating
Schwann cells in the lung, and there are no known trans-
genic mouse tools to study these cells in vivo.
The primary goal of this study was, therefore, to inves-
tigate the relationship of non-myelinating Schwann cells
to pulmonary nerves in the airways and vasculature and
to establish whether existing transgenic mouse tools
would be useful for studying their function. We focused
on the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter,
which is a cognate marker of astrocytes and expressed
in enteric glial and non-myelinating Schwann cells
(Jessen and Mirsky, 1985; Ruhl et al., 2004;
Gulbransen and Sharkey, 2012). We first screened estab-
lished, commercially available transgenic mouse lines that
express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the lung under
the control of GFAP promoters and then used the mice
to verify expression of the glial marker S100 and to
describe the morphology, anatomic distribution, and
association of glial cells with pulmonary nerves.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All animal procedures were performed in accordance
with the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at Stanford University. Six to
10-week-old mice on a C57BL/6J background purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, were
utilized for all studies: wild-type C57BL/6J mice
(JAX#00664), GFAP-Cre (JAX#12886), ChAT-Cre
(JAX#6410), Rosa26 eGFP (JAX#4077), Rosa26
Confetti (JAX#13731), and Rosa26 TDT (JAX#7914).
Perfusion and Tissue Preparation
Mice were heavily anesthetized with chloral hydrate and
terminally perfused through the right ventricle with
10­20 ml of cold 0.9% saline containing heparin
(10 units/ml) until the lungs were completely clear of
blood. Lungs were collected and drop fixed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde in phosphate buffer for 24 hr, transferred to
30% sucrose in phosphate buffer for 3­7 days, and 40 mm
sequential coronal sections obtained using a freezing slid-
ing microtome (Microm HM430).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was routinely performed on every
12th section so that all lung areas would be equally rep-
resented. Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)
immunohistochemistry was performed. Free-floating sec-
tions were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incu-
bated with 2% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1% Triton X-100
for 1 hr at room temperature, then rinsed with TBS.
Sections were blocked with 5% serum for 1 hr then incu-
bated with primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in 0.1%
Triton X-100 and 3% serum overnight at room tempera-
ture. The following day, the sections were rinsed with
TBS and incubated with a biotinylated secondary anti-
body (Table 2) for 1 hr. After rinsing with TBS, sections
were incubated in avidin­biotin peroxidase complex
(Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) for
1 hr, rinsed with TBS and a final wash with 0.1 M Tris
and visualized with DAB for 1 to 2 min.

Immunofluorescence
Free-floating sections were rinsed with TBS and blocked
for 1 hr in 5% serum from the species in which the sec-
ondary antibody was raised diluted in 0.1% Triton
X-100. Sections were incubated overnight at room tem-
perature in primary antibodies diluted in 0.1% Triton
X-100 and 3% serum according to the concentrations
in Table 1. The next day, sections were rinsed with
TBS. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (Table 2) were
centrifuged before use at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and
then diluted 1:200 in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3%
serum. Sections were incubated in the appropriate
secondary antibodies at room temperature for 4 to 6 hr,
rinsed in TBS, wet mounted with Vectashield hard set
mounting media with 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Vector Labs) and coverslipped.
Image Acquisition and Analysis
Images of DAB-stained sections were taken using a Zeiss
Axio Imager M1 with charge-coupled device camera
using a 20Â objective. Immunofluorescent sections were
imaged using 40Â, 1.15 numerical aperture and 63Â, 1.30
numerical aperture oil objectives on a Leica TCS SPE
confocal microscope using Leica Application Suite

Advanced Fluorescence software. Z-stack images of
fluorescent lung sections were acquired by sequential
scanning every 1 mm and taken at a 2,048 Â 2,048 pixel
size, with a line average of 2 to reduce noise. Stacks were
reconstructed using FIJI (NIH), and Photoshop (Adobe)
software was used to change brightness and contrast of
the images.
To quantify double labeling, we used an unbiased
approach. For example, to examine whether GFP expres-
sion in GFAPcre-GFP mice was present in GFAP þ cells,
lung sections from three animals were immunostained for
GFAP with a red (Alexafluor 555) secondary. When a
GFP-expressing cell was identified in the green channel,
the channel was switched to red to determine whether it
also stained for GFAP. Conversely, to evaluate which
percent of GFAP immunostained cells express GFP,
GFAP þ cells were identified in the red channel then the
channel switched to green to score GFP expression. At
least 100 cells from each mouse were counted for each of
these questions.
Antibody Characterization
Several antibodies against GFAP, an intracytoplasmic
filamentous protein that forms part of the cytoskeleton
of glial cells, were used. The rabbit polyclonal antibody
produced by Dako has been used extensively to study
glial cells both within the central nervous system (CNS)
and in the periphery (Middeldorp and Hol, 2011;
Yamazaki et al., 2011; Zamanian et al., 2012; Voss
et al., 2013; Forrest et al., 2014). We have tested this
antibody by Western blots of brain and lung homogen-
ates; in both tissues, we find a specific band of 50 kDa,
which is the appropriate size for GFAP. We have used
this antibody for DAB and immunofluorescence in both
brain (Cekanaviciute et al., 2014) and lung and find
brightly stained cells that are of astrocyte morphology
in brain and what would be expected of the morphology
and distribution for non-myelinating Schwann cells in the
lung. Other GFAP antibodies were tested (made in rat
and chicken, Table 1), and although they stained strongly
and specifically for astrocytes in the brain staining in the
lung appeared to be specific but was extremely weak.
The Millipore anti-GFP antibody is made against
highly purified native GFP from Aequorea victoria and
reacts with both native and recombinant GFP sources.
The manufacturer reports that the antibody binds to a
specific 30-kDa band in Western blot of lysates from
Escherichia coli expressing GFP. No band is seen in lys-
ates from E. coli that do not express GFP. In immuno-
cytochemistry, GFP is detected in cells transfected with a
plasmid directing expression of GFP or GFP-fusion pro-
tein, cells that do not express GFP exhibit no detectable
staining. In our laboratory, we have verified the specifi-
city of this antibody through DAB immunostaining of
lung and brain tissues from mice that express GFP
under a GFAP promoter. Additionally, we have ensured
that the staining is limited to GFP-expressing cells by
using the GFP antibody with a 555 conjugated
secondary.
Myelin basic protein (MBP) is one of the most abun-
dant protein components of myelin both in the CNS and
peripheral nervous systems (PNS). This Abcam antibody
has been widely used as an oligodendrocyte and myelinat-
ing Schwann cell marker (Yu et al., 2009; Latimer et al.,
2011; Fricker et al., 2013). The manufacturer has tested
this antibody through immunohistochemistry of parafor-
maldehyde fixed frozen spinal cord sections, paraffin
embedded brain sections, in which appropriate myelin
staining was observed. On Western blots, two bands of
19 and 26 kDa represent MBP isoforms. In our lung
immunostains, we observe sparse but present labeling of
structures of appropriate morphology for myelin
sheathes. In double stains, MBP-labeled structures can
be seen surrounding nerves.
Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, also
known as CD31, reacts with adult and embryonic endo-
thelial cells. The manufacturer has tested the antibody
with immunohistochemical staining of zinc-paraffin sec-
tions of mouse spleen, lung, heart, and thymus and
reports that it stains endothelial cells on small and large
blood vessels. In our hands, this antibody shows wide-
spread staining in lung parenchyma and larger blood ves-
sels appropriate to vascular endothelium. Additionally,
this antibody does not stain airway endothelial cells.
Protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) is widely used as a
pan-neuronal and neuroepithelial cell marker in the PNS,
including the lung (Lauweryns and Van Ranst, 1988;
Veres et al., 2007). The antibody labels neuronal cell
bodies and axons and neuroendocrine cells in the CNS
and PNS. In vivo substrates of PGP9.5 are largely
unknown (Day and Thompson, 2010). According to the
manufacturer, anti-human PGP9.5 is particularly suitable
for detecting small nerve fibers in peripheral tissues. We
observe specific staining morphologically appropriate for
nerves and neuroepithelial bodies in the lung that have
the correct anatomic distribution.
a-Smooth muscle actin specifically labels the a-smooth
muscle isoform of actin and does not react with other
major actin isoforms present in fibroblasts or epithelial
cells, striated muscle, myocardium, or gamma-smooth
muscle isoform. This antibody labels vascular and vis-
ceral smooth muscle cells in adult and embryonic tissues.
a-Smooth muscle actin is a well-characterized marker of
myofibroblasts used to immunolabel smooth muscle in
lung (Cho et al., 2004; Lembrechts et al., 2011; Forrest
et al., 2014) and other peripheral tissues (Arnold et al.,
2013; Voss et al., 2013). Western blot validation by the
manufacturer produces a specific 42-kDa band. In our
lung stains, this antibody labels smooth muscle in the
4 ASN Neuro
trachea and large bronchi, which results in a striated
appearance that is appropriate for airway smooth
muscle. Smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls are
also labeled.
Calcium-binding proteins, such as S100, are expressed
in many cell types. S100B is most abundant in glial cells
of the CNS and PNS but is also present in other cell
types, including a subpopulation of neurons. The S100
antibody from Dako is widely used in the literature to
immunostain peripheral glial cells (Young et al., 2002;
D'Antonio, 2006; Voss et al., 2013; Kabouridis et al.,
2015). According to the manufacturer, the S100 antibody
used was solid-phase absorbed with human plasma and
bovine serum proteins and on Western blot of purified
human recombinant S100 proteins, this antibody labels
S100B strongly, S100A1 weakly, and S100A6 very
weakly. No reaction seen with other S100A proteins
tested, including S100A4.
The Millipore antibody for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
is widely used to study dopaminergic and adrenergic neu-
rons in the CNS (Forrest et al., 2014). TH is the first
rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the cat-
echolamines dopamine and noradrenaline from tyrosine.
The manufacturer has tested the antibody through
Western blot, which shows a specific 62-kDa band. In
our hands, we observe characteristic immunostaining of
sympathetic nerves that is limited to vesicles and, there-
fore, confers a beaded appearance. In lung, immunostain-
ing is restricted to areas where sympathetic nerves are
expected to be, surrounding airways and in blood vessel
walls.
Results
Cells in the Mouse Lung Express Glial-Specific
Markers S100 and GFAP
We began our characterization of Schwann cells in the
lung by immunostaining lung sections from wild-type
C57BL/6J mice for two glial-specific markers. The cal-
cium-binding protein S100B has been reported to be a
marker for peripheral non-myelinating glia (Cocchia
and Michetti, 1981; Sheppard et al., 1983; Stoll et al.,
1989; Cabarrocas et al., 2003). We immunostained lung
sections with an antibody that strongly labels S100B but
exhibits minor cross-reactivity to S100A (S100 antibody).
We found that there were indeed prominent, nucleated,
elongated cells that were most notable around medium to
larger airways and vascular structures (Figure 1(A) and
(B), arrows), as would be expected for glia that accom-
pany pulmonary nerves. We noted that some of these
elongated cells exhibited a distinctly smoother, more ser-
pentine appearance (Figure 1(A), asterisk). However, we
also consistently observed immunostaining in some bron-
chial epithelial cells (Figure 1(A) and (B), arrowhead).
We next immunostained against GFAP using a poly-
clonal rabbit antibody that labels all GFAP isoforms
(Clairembault et al., 2014). GFAP is a type III intermedi-
ate filament protein (Steinert and Roop, 1988) that is a
cognate marker of astrocytes in the brain and has also
been reported in peripheral non-myelinating Schwann
cells and enteric glia (Jessen and Mirsky, 1985;
Gulbransen and Sharkey, 2012). We observed GFAP-
immunoreactive cells that were of similar morphology
and in a similar location to the cells identified by S100
immunohistochemistry (Figure 1(C) and (D), arrows). In
both immunostains, these cells form an intricate network
that surrounds large airways. The distribution is very
dense around the primary bronchi and becomes progres-
sively less dense in more distal airways. We quantified the
presence of GFAP-expressing cells by counting 100 bron-
chi that were over 100 mm in diameter and cut into a
cross-sectional plane in each of three mice. All bronchi
counted had GFAP-expressing cells located just outside
the basal lamina and partially or completely surrounding
the airways.
Colocalization of GFAP and S100 could not be con-
firmed via double-immunostaining because both antibo-
dies are made in rabbit. Interestingly several other anti-
GFAP antibodies, a monoclonal rat, and a polyclonal
chicken antibody (Table 1), that in our hands specifically
and strongly label brain astrocytes, produced extremely
weak immunostaining when applied to lung tissue.
GFAP Transgenic Mice Drive GFP Expression in
GFAP and S100 Immunostained Cells
Transgenic mouse lines that express specifically in GFAP
and S100 positive cells were, therefore, necessary to fur-
ther characterize these cells immunohistochemically and
also to study their function in the future. We turned to
commercially available transgenic mouse tools to deter-
mine if we could use a mouse line containing a GFAP
promoter to drive expression in peripheral non-myelinat-
ing Schwann cells. We evaluated lungs from four mice
lines designed to express GFP in GFAP-expressing cells
(Table 3). For each mouse line, we first investigated if
GFP was present by DAB immunostaining of the lung
and if it was present, whether it exhibited the anatomic
location and morphology expected based on GFAP and
S100 immunostaining. Next, in order to determine
whether GFP expression was limited to cells expressing
GFAP, we performed a fluorescent double stain.
The first three lines we evaluated did not exhibit
appropriate GFP expression. In FVB/NJ-GFAP-GFP
mice, GFP could be detected through DAB staining
and appeared to be in the correct anatomic location
and morphology for GFAP positive cells. However,
when we used fluorescent antibodies, we did not observe
GFP immunostaining. Next, we characterized GFP

expression in lungs of C57BL/6J-GFAP-cre/ERT2 mice
crossed with a C57BL/6J-Rosa 26 eGFP reporter line.
Mice were dosed with 300 mg/kg of tamoxifen dissolved
in corn oil orally for 5 consecutive days and evaluated
4 days later. We observed extensive nonspecific GFP
immunostaining in the lung, and in addition GFP was
also not present in most cells that immunostained for
GFAP. We then tested the C57BL/6J-GFAP-GFP
Pleiades transgenic mouse, but no GFP expression was
found in lung.
The last strain we evaluated was a C57BL/6J-GFAP-
Cre crossed with C57BL/6J-Rosa26 eGFP reporter mice,
which we will abbreviate as GFAPcre-GFP mice here.
GFAPcre-GFP mice exhibited GFP expression in the
expected morphology and location for non-myelinating
Schwann cells and excellent colocalization with GFAP
immunostaining (Figure 2). To formally test concord-
ance, we counted 100 cells per mouse and found that
95% of cells that express GFP also immunolabeled for
GFAP (Figure 2(K)). In addition, 98% of cells that
immunostained for GFAP coexpressed GFP (Figure
2(L)).
To verify that the morphologically similar cells that we
had immunostained in wild-type mouse lungs for GFAP
and S100 (Figure 1) were the same cells, we evaluated
lungs from GFAPcre-GFP mice with anti-S100 antibody
(Figure 3). The GFAPcre-GFP mice exhibited close con-
cordance of S100 immunostaining with GFP expression.
The bronchial epithelial cells seen in the DAB stain for
S100 were also detected in fluorescent stains, but they did
not colocalize with GFP (Figure 3(D)­(G), arrowhead).
GFP expression in the distal airways was sparse, and

these cells did coimmunostain with S100 (Figure 3(K)­
(N)). Ninety-five percent of GFP-labeled cells around air-
ways colocalized with S100 (Figure 3(O)) and 99% of
S100-immunostained cells also exhibited GFP immunos-
taining (Figure 3(P)). GFAP staining was not found in
distal airways; however, GFAPcre-GFP mice expressed
GFP, which coimmunostained with S100 and PGP9.5.
We noted that the smooth, serpentine cells that
immunostained for GFAP and S100 in DAB appeared to
be associated with pulmonary blood vessels, which were
identified by their characteristic morphology and anatomic
position in relation to airways. We confirmed that these
distinctly shaped cells were exclusively associated with
blood vessels by immunostaining GFAPcre-GFP mouse
lungs with the vascular endothelial marker platelet endo-
thelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1, Figure 4). As
with the cells associated with airways, vasculature-asso-
ciated GFP þ cells coimmunolabeled with both GFAP
(Figure 4(H)­(J)) and S100 (Figure 4(K)­(M)). In contrast
to the airways, which almost always had GFP þ cells sur-
rounding them, only 55% medium to large blood vessels
exhibited GFP-expressing cells (Figure 4(N)).
In GFAPcre-GFP mouse lungs, all of the cells asso-
ciated with large airways and vasculature that express
GFP also exhibit GFAP and S100 immunostaining. The
cells that do not exhibit GFAP immunostaining but do
express GFP are the small airway-associated cells that
also costain for S100 (Figure 3(K)­(N)).
GFAP-Expressing Cells in the Lung Are Associated
With Pulmonary Nerves
An important characteristic of both myelinating and non-
myelinating Schwann cells is close association with neu-
rons or nerves. Peripheral nerves, including those in the
lung (Lauweryns and Van Ranst, 1988), immunostain with
the marker PGP9.5. Dual labeling of GFP and PGP9.5 in
GFAPcre-GFP mice showed that GFP-expressing cells
were closely associated with PGP9.5 immunostained
nerves (Figure 5). PGP9.5-immunostained cells consist-
ently exhibited axonal densities that are larger and more

5(K)­(M), arrowheads), and the glial cell sheath appears
to have fenestrations that coincide with these densities. Of
note, the GFP þ cells in the distal airways that costain for
S100 (Figure 3(K)­(N)) are also associated with PGP9.5
labeled nerves (Figure 5(N)­(Q)). Almost all GFP-expres-
sing cells were associated with PGP9.5 immunostained
nerves (Figure 5(R)), and 12% of nerves did not associate
with GFP, which may correspond to myelinated nerves or
naked nerve terminals (Figure 5(S)).
PGP9.5 also immunostains neuroepithelial bodies
which we identified by their characteristic morphology
and location within the airway lumen (Figure 6).
Neuroepithelial bodies are clusters of specialized

neuroendocrine cells, a distinct population of epithelial
cells that have endocrine secretory functions (Van
Lommel et al., 1999) and are supplied by a variety of
nerve types (Brouns et al., 2008). Neuroepithelial
bodies did not express GFP and were not ensheathed
by GFP-expressing cells. However, GFP þ non-myelinat-
ing Schwann cells appeared to be in contact with the
basal aspect of neuroepithelial bodies.
Non-Myelinating Schwann Cells Are Closely
Associated With Sympathetic Nerves
We also examined colocalization of GFP in GFAPcre-
GFP mice with sympathetic nerves (Figure 7), which
innervate both the airways and vasculature of the
mouse lung. We used TH to immunostain sympathetic
nerves and their terminals. Sympathetic cell bodies are
located outside of the lung; the superior cervical and stel-
late ganglia supply the trachea, and the stellate ganglion
and thoracic ganglia 2 to 6 provide sympathetic innerv-
ation to the rest of the lung (Honjin, 1956; Kummer
et al., 1992). GFP-expressing glia in the lung, on the
other hand, do have nuclei, so non-myelinating
Schwann cells could be identified by their nuclei despite
their intimate association with sympathetic axons.
Whenever a serpentine shaped, GFP-expressing cell was
noted it was always associated with a vascular structure
and was always positive for TH immunostaining (Figure

nearly always associated with GFP þ cells (94%, Figure

In contrast, sympathetic fibers associated with vascular

cre-driven recombination results in expression of yellow
or green, red, or cyan fluorescent proteins in adjacent
cells. We found that GFAP-expressing glia were present
in these nerve bundles and that multiple glia line up lon-
gitudinally along each nerve fiber (Figure 8(A)).
Myelinated nerves in the lung are predominantly pre-
ganglionic cholinergic parasympathetic nerves, but there
are also some myelinated sensory nerves (Brouns et al.,
2005). We observed prominent nerve bundles in the lar-
gest airways that immunostained for GFAP in parasym-
pathetic nerve reporter mice (choline acetyl transferase
(ChAT)-cre mice crossed with Rosa26-tandem dimer
tomato (TDT) reporter line, Figure 8(B)­(D)). We
observed close association of GFAP and thinner TDT
positive fibers; however, thicker fibers that formed part
of larger bundles did not clearly colocalize with GFAP,
implying that myelinating Schwann cells do not consist-
ently coexpress GFAP. Indeed, unmyelinated TH-
expressing sympathetic nerves did clearly associate with
GFP in GFAPcre-GFP mice but neither marker asso-
ciated with MBP in multiaxon bundles (Figure 8(E)­(L)).
Discussion
In the present study, we describe GFAP-expressing non-
myelinating Schwann cells in the lung. We validate a
transgenic mouse line that drives expression of cre under
a GFAP promoter and demonstrate that in GFAPcre-
GFP mice, GFP is widely expressed but limited to non-
myelinating Schwann cells that immunostain for GFAP
and S100 and are associated with pulmonary nerves. Non-
myelinating Schwann cells ensheathe pulmonary nerves
that travel distally in large bundles (Figure 9(A)) along
the bronchial tree. They also ensheathe the nerves that
branch off from the bundles to form part of an intricate
bronchial plexus, which can be seen in the cross-sectional
plane surrounding bronchi (Figure 9(B)) and have a mesh-
like appearance in the longitudinal plane (Figure 9(C)).
Glia that are associated with the pulmonary vasculature
also immunostain for S100 and GFAP are sparse and
have a characteristic morphology that is smoother and
more serpentine than airway-associated glial cells
(Figure 9(D)). In small airways, GFAP immunostaining
is not detectable, however, slender, elongated GFP-
expressing cells also immunostain for S100 and are asso-
ciated with nerves immunostained with PGP9.5
(Figure 9(E)). Non-myelinating Schwann cells are intim-
ately associated with TH immunolabeled sympathetic
nerves both in airways and blood vessels.
Beginning in the 1950s, electron microscopy studies
revealed the fine structure of unmyelinated peripheral
nerve fibers and Schwann cells (Hess and

mammals, including mice (Hung et al., 1972), rats
(Jeffery and Reid, 1973), and humans (Fox et al., 1980)
are supplied by unmyelinated nerve axons that are par-
tially or completely surrounded by non-myelinating
Schwann cells. Similar studies have explored the
innervation of other visceral organs such as the liver
(Yamada, 1965), kidney (Fazan et al., 2002), spleen
(Felten and Olschowka, 1987), adrenal medulla
(Coupland, 1965), and bone marrow (Yamazaki and
Allen, 1990), among others, but Schwann cells are men-
tioned only in the context of nerve axons.

No unifying functions of glial cells in visceral organs
are known, or if they are specialized by organ. In the
bone marrow, non-myelinating Schwann cells are
involved in maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell
niche (Yamazaki et al., 2011). In the lung, heart, intes-
tine, bladder, and kidney non-myelinating Schwann cells
express a specialized sodium channel and have been
implicated to play a role in extracellular sodium level
regulation (Watanabe et al., 2002). There is a growing
interest in enteric glia as a component of the immune
barrier in the gut (Bush et al., 1998; Cornet et al.,
2001; Cabarrocas et al., 2003; Savidge et al., 2007;
Gulbransen and Sharkey, 2012) that responds to sympa-
thetic nerve stimulation (Gulbransen et al., 2010).
Enteric glia differ from non-myelinating Schwann cells
(Gershon and Rothman, 1991); however, they are the
Figure 9. Diagram of a mouse lung showing the location of non-myelinating Schwann cells (A). Nerves travel down the lung in thick
bundles of nerves that are ensheathed by glia. Glia-ensheathed nerves form a mesh that surround large and small bronchi and form an
almost complete semicircle around the cross-sectional aspect of the airways (B) and appear as a network on the longitudinal aspect (C).
Glia are also found ensheathing blood vessel nerves (D), although at a much lower density compared with airways. Blood vessel-associated
glia have a smoother and more serpentine morphology compared with airway glia. In small airways, (E) GFAP immunostaining is not visible;
however, we do find the presence of GFP in the small airways GFAP-GFP mice. Although the morphology of the GFP þ cells found in small
airways is different to that of larger airways or blood vessels, these cells do co-immunostain with other glial markers (S100) and nerve
markers (PGP9.5).

best characterized visceral glia and may have common
functional pathways with other visceral glia.
The availability of this GFAP-cre transgenic mouse
tool makes it possible to study the functions of pulmon-
ary glia. We chose to evaluate GFAP expression in the
lung because it is a marker of peripheral non-myelinating
Schwann cells and enteric glia (Jessen et al., 1984;
Gulbransen and Sharkey, 2012). Additionally, there are
commercially available mice that express transgenes
under GFAP promoters. However, few transgenic tools
have been validated in non-myelinating Schwann cells. A
transgenic line of S100B-GFP mice express GFP specif-
ically in brain astrocytes (Vives et al., 2003); in the
kidney, however, GFP is also expressed in cuboidal epi-
thelial cells of Bowman's capsule (Darlot et al., 2008).
Given that some bronchial epithelial cells immunostain
for S100, it is possible that S100B-GFP mice also express
GFP in those pulmonary cells. Some transgenic mouse
lines have been created to study activity of specific gene
functions of non-myelinating Schwann cells: one
expresses a dominant negative ErbB2 receptor under
the control a GFAP promoter preferentially in the PNS
(sciatic nerve, Chen et al., 2003 and inner ear, Rio et al.,
2001) and minimally in the CNS or GFAP-IkB-alpha-dn
mice, in which glial NF-jB signaling is disrupted in the
sciatic nerve-associated non-myelinating Schwann cells
(Fu et al., 2010).
We establish here that GFAP-cre mice will be a useful
tool to study non-myelinating Schwann cells in the lung.
When crossed to Rosa26 GFP reporter mice, expression
is remarkably faithful to GFAP immunohistochemistry
and limited to non-myelinating Schwann cells identified
with GFAP and S100 immunostaining. Only 5% of GFP
expressing cells do not immunostain for GFAP or S100;
however, their morphology and localization closely
resembles those cells that immunostain for these glial
markers. We may not have always observed GFP colo-
calizing with GFAP because GFP is particularly concen-
trated in the nuclei and decreases as it spreads out to the
rest of the cell processes, while GFAP immunostaining
tends to be stronger in the processes and less within the
nucleus. Additionally, cells that immunostain for either
GFAP or S100 overwhelmingly (99%) express GFP.
We did not see convincing evidence of GFAP expres-
sion in myelinating Schwann cells and propose here that
it is an exclusive marker for non-myelinating Schwann
cells in the lung. The large nerve bundles that are asso-
ciated with large airways contain tightly packed myelin-
ated and unmyelinated axons. Despite this, we never
observed GFP clearly colocalized with MBP immunos-
taining in GFAPcre-GFP mice. In non-transgenic mice,
we very occasionally observed some GFAP immunostain-
ing on the cut edge of a bundle of myelinated nerves. This
was also observed with other antibodies, and although we
think is an artifact, myelinating Schwann cells have been
reported to express GFAP when there is axonal injury
(Stoll and Mu
¨ ller, 1999). Therefore, although we cannot
exclude that some myelinating Schwann cells may express
GFAP after injury, we conclude that in uninjured mice
GFAP expression is confined to non-myelinating
Schwann cells.
There are reports of GFAP-expressing lung cells that
are not glial cells but are instead peribronchial fibro-
blasts, with Zhao and Burt (2007) attributing them to a
``stellate cell'' network (Hainfellner et al., 2001). In con-
trast, we report here that GFAP-expressing cells in the
lung are non-myelinating Schwann cells that are asso-
ciated with pulmonary nerves. We did not observe
GFAP-expressing cells that were not associated with pul-
monary nerves. The previous reports did not perform
double immunofluorescence with nerve markers. The
morphology of the GFAP immunostained cells reported
in the lung by Zhao and Burt is similar to the GFAP
immunostaining that we show here but with shorter pro-
cesses. We speculate that this is because they used 10 mm
paraffin embedded sections while we used 40 mm thick
floating sections, and that in their slides, Schwann cell
processes were transected. We do report here a popula-
tion of cells within the inner lining of the airways that
immunostain for S100, but not for GFAP or GFP.
However, these cells are unlikely to be fibroblasts since
their anatomy and morphology is very characteristic of
airway epithelial cells. Finally, the S100 antibody that we
used does not immunostain for S100A4, which is also
known as fibroblast specific protein 1, a specific fibroblast
marker.
Although GFAP expression has been reported in
neural crest precursor cells (Johnson et al., 2009), cre
recombinase did not appear to be expressed in neuronal
axons in this GFAPcre-GFP mouse line. The resolution
that we achieved with confocal microscopy was not suffi-
cient to convincingly show Schwann cells and nerve axons
as separate cells. However, electron microscopy images of
non-myelinating Schwann cells in the lung clearly show
that each axon is partially or completely surrounded by
Schwann cell processes (Hung et al., 1972). Our immu-
nostaining is thus consistent with this relationship
between non-myelinating Schwann cells and axons.
Additionally, sympathetic nerve axons have their cell
bodies outside of the lung (Strack et al., 2002); therefore,
the nuclei that are found associated with TH þ nerves
belong to glia, not nerves. We found that non-myelinating
Schwann cells do not ensheathe neuroepithelial bodies;
however, they do contact the basal aspect and are prob-
ably associated with capsaicin-sensitive, calcitonin gene-
related peptide and substance P immunoreactive nerve
fibers, which contact neuroepithelial bodies at their
basal pole only (Brouns et al., 2005).
This is, to our knowledge, the first characterization of
non-myelinating Schwann cells in the lung, including
16 ASN Neuro
their basic morphology and anatomic distribution as well
as immunohistochemical markers and relationships to
lung innervation. We also identify a GFAP-cre mouse
line that can be bred to floxed lines to disrupt genes or
pathways of interest in non-myelinating Schwann cells in
the lung.
Summary Statement
We describe the morphology and anatomic distribution
of pulmonary glia, non-myelinating Schwann cells that
surround pulmonary autonomic nerves and validate a
transgenic mouse tool to study the function of these cells.
