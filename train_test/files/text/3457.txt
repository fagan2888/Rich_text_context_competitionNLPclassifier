Introduction
Carotid atherosclerosis is highly associated with the
severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is strongly
associated with future myocardial infarction.1,2 A close
association between carotid atherosclerosis and the extent
of CAD has been well established.3,4 CAD is the leading
cause of mortality following ischemic stroke.5 Among
several factors that lead to the formation of atherosclero-
sis, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has
well-established roles in atherogenesis.6 Activated RAAS
is associated with an increased risk of coronary and cere-
brovascular events independent of blood pressure lev-
els.7,8 The most well-known enzymes participating in the
RAAS are renin and angiotensinogen-converting enzyme.
Plasma renin concentration is associated with long-term
cardiovascular mortality in patients referred to coronary
angiography.9 Aldosterone can exert proinflammatory
effects via mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent and
-independent pathways. There is an important role for

Abstract
Introduction: We aimed to determine the association between plasma aldosterone and renin levels as well as their
ratios with carotid plaques in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
Materials and methods: Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque score were evaluated in 111 patients with
stable CAD. Plasma renin and aldosterone levels were measured in all patients. Aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) was
calculated. All patients were categorized into: Group 1 (normal coronary angiography), Group 2 (patients had CAD but
without carotid plaque) and Group 3 (patients had CAD and at least one carotid plaque).
Results: Renin levels are significantly higher in Group 3 than in Group 1 and 2. ARR was significantly lower in Group 3
than in Group 1 and 2. Renin levels were found to be positively correlated with carotid IMT and plaque score but ARR
was inversely associated with carotid IMT and plaque score. Renin levels and ARR are independently associated with
presence of carotid plaque in CAD patients (OR 1.124, CI 1.021­1.237, p = 0.017 and OR 0.906, CI 0.839­0.978, p =
0.011, adjusted for age, respectively).
Conclusions: Plasma renin and ARR but not aldosterone are independently associated with presence of carotid plaques
in CAD patients. Hence, the linkage between aldosterone and renin plays a more important role than aldosterone alone
in carotid atherosclerosis.

the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation leading
to endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling dur-
ing activation of RAAS.10 Aldosterone is considered a key
player in cellular processes underlying vascular hypertro-
phy and fibrosis.11 Plasma aldosterone was an independ-
ent predictor of carotid plaque progression in patients
with cardiovascular risks.12 In patients with stable CAD,
plasma aldosterone levels are independently associated
with the risk of major vascular events and vascular mor-
tality and with atherosclerotic burden.13 There was an
inverse relationship between plasma renin activity and
carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and severity of
carotid artery lesions in patients with mild-to-moderate
hypertension.14 However, high plasma aldosterone or
aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) were found to be associ-
ated with impaired flow-mediated dilation and progres-
sion of subclinical atherosclerosis in young to middle-aged
individuals.15
Hence, the association between RAAS and carotid
atherosclerosis and the evidence linking the RAAS with
central and cerebral vascular atherosclerosis remains
controversial. Therefore, we investigated the relation-
ships of plasma aldosterone and renin levels and ARR
with carotid IMT and plaque score in patients with angio-
graphically proven CAD.
Materials and methods
Study population
A total of 111 patients with stable angina pectoris under-
going coronary angiography were enrolled in this study.
The medical ethics committee of Kaohsiung Municipal
Min-Sheng Hospital approved the study, and written
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Smoking status was classified as non-smoking, ex-
smoker (ceased smoking for at least one year) or current
smoker. Patients with Conn's disease, Addison's disease,
cirrhosis of the liver or undergoing hormone replacement
therapy were excluded from the study. Clinical blood
pressure was measured before duplex ultrasound exami-
nation with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. The
measurement of blood pressure followed the guidelines
outlined by the American Heart Association Council on
High Blood Pressure Research.16 The diagnosis of hyper-
tension was based on multiple measurements on separate
occasions over a period of time. The patients were seated
with their back supported and both feet lying flat on the
floor for at least five minutes in a quiet room, with an
empty bladder. At least two measurements of blood pres-
sure were taken each time, separated by at least one min-
ute. Blood pressure was measured by a mercury
sphygmomanometer. Body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated as weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in
meters) squared. We also measured serum levels of urea
nitrogen, sodium, potassium, creatinine, glucose, total
cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hs-CRP), supine plasma renin and aldosterone
levels.
Measurements of carotid IMT and plaque
score
Duplex ultrasonography of the left and right common
carotid arteries (CCAs) was performed with a 7.5-MHz
linear array transducer on a SONOS 5500 ultrasound sys-
tem (Hewlett-Packard, Andover, MA, USA). All ultra-
sound measurements were made by two experienced
vascular technologists and images were recorded on digi-
tal video discs for further analyses using previously
described methods.17,18 The distance between the lumen-
intima interface and the media-adventitia interface of the
near and far walls of distal CCAs and bifurcations were
measured. Carotid IMT was measured at eight points of
each CCA and bifurcation and the mean value of all meas-
urements of both left and right carotid arteries was calcu-
lated. Thickened carotid IMT was defined as the mean
value > 0.9 mm. Carotid plaque is defined as the presence
of focal wall thickening that is at least 50% greater than
that of the surrounding vessel wall or as a focal region with
carotid IMT greater than 1.5 mm that protrudes into the
lumen that is distinct from the adjacent boundary.19 Total
carotid plaque score was defined as the sum of the pres-
ence of plaques at the near and far walls of bilateral sides
at three locations (CCA, carotid bifurcation and internal
carotid artery).
Coronary angiographic evaluation
Coronary angiography was performed by the Judkin's
method. Two different scores were used to evaluate the
angiographic severity and extension of CAD: the number
of stenosed (>50% reduction of luminal diameter) or
occluded vessels (one- to three-vessel disease), and the
complexity and severity scoring method according to the
SYNTAX score.20 Scoring of all coronary angiograms was
performed visually by a single experienced observer who
was blinded to clinical and laboratory data. The intraclass
correlation coefficient for intra-rater reliability was 1.0
(one- to three-vessel disease score), and 0.93 (tertiles of
the SYNTAX score).
Measurements of plasma renin and
aldosterone levels
Venous blood was drawn (typically between 8 a.m. and
9 a.m.) from each participant after he or she had been in a
supine position for five to 10 minutes. Plasma renin and
aldosterone concentrations were measured using radioim-
munoassay according to current guidelines in plasma
Lee and Lai 1161
samples obtained with patients in the supine position, as
previously described.21 The coated tube radioimmu-
noassay kits for in vitro diagnostic use were manufactured
by Diagnostic System Laboratories Inc (Webster, TX,
USA) and OBI-DSL (Cherwell Innovation Centre, Upper
Heyford, Oxfordshire, UK) and used a highly specific
rabbit antialdosterone and antirenin polyclonal antibody.
Cross-reactivity to closely related naturally occurring
steroids is negligible. For aldosterone, the normal range
was 35­300 pg/ml supine. For renin, the normal range
was 3.6­20 pg/ml supine. Plasma ARR was calculated as
aldosterone in pg/ml divided by renin in pg/ml.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean±SD, or as a percentage,
when appropriate. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
to evaluate normal distribution. Differences between
groups were assessed either by the two-tailed Mann-
Whitney test or by the Kruskal-Wallis test. In the univari-
ate analysis, unadjusted means were compared by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). To analyze the relation-
ship between variables and carotid IMT and plaque score,
univariatelinearregressionanalysiswasused.Correlations
between variables were analyzed by Spearman's correla-
tion coefficient by rank. To predict the presence of CAD
patients with carotid plaque or thickened IMT, logistic
regression analysis (forced entry methods) was used.
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were
constructed to assess the best values of aldosterone, renin
and ARR, optimizing sensitivity for the identification of
the presence of CAD patients with or without carotid
plaque or thickened IMT. The area under the ROC curve
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the
predictive power for the presence or absence of CAD
patients with carotid plaque or thickened IMT. A two-
sided probability value of p < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed
with SPSS software (version Windows 18.0, SPSS Inc,
Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
Among all enrolled patients, 30 patients (27%, Group 1)
had normal coronary angiography, 32 (29%, Group 2) had
CAD but without carotid plaque and 49 (44%, Group 3)
had CAD and at least one carotid plaque (Table 1). The
prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking
status was not different among these three groups. The
mean age of Group 3 was older than Group 1 and 2 (p =
0.013). Serum creatinine was significantly higher in Group
3 than in Group 1 and 2 (p = 0.001). Group 3 also had a
thicker carotid IMT than that of Group 1 and 2 (p = 0.001).
The mean SYNTAX score in Group 3 was significantly
higher than in Group 1 and 2 (p < 0.001). Medications
were not significantly different except the usage of clopi-
dogrel was more prevalent in Group 3 patients. All sub-
jects had plasma aldosterone levels within the normal
range, except for one patient with aldosterone slightly
above the upper limit of the normal range. Nevertheless,
plasma aldosterone levels were higher in Group 3 (Group
3 vs. Group 1, 100.5±57.4 vs. 81.0±21.2 pg/ml, p = 0.154
and Group 3 vs. Group 2, 100.5±57.4 vs. 87.7±32.8 pg/ml,
p = 0.288) but without statistical significance (Figure 1).
However, plasma renin levels were significantly different
among the three groups and were highest in Group 3
(Group 3 vs. Group 1, 24.5±27.7 vs. 9.2±6.9 pg/ml, p =
0.020 and Group 3 vs. Group 2, 24.5±27.7 pg/ml vs.
10.1±10.3 pg/ml, p = 0.011). In addition, the mean value of
ARR was significantly lower in Group 3 than those in
Groups 1 and 2 (Group 3 vs. Group 1, 8.4±7.5 vs. 13.7±10.0
pg/ml, p = 0.019 and Group 3 vs. Group 2, 8.4±7.5 pg/ml
vs. 18.0±17.1 pg/ml, p = 0.001). Serum potassium and
sodium levels were not significantly different among the
three groups (Table 1).
Factors affecting carotid IMT and plaque score
Univariate analysis of clinical and biochemical factors
affecting carotid IMT and carotid plaque score is shown in
Table 2. Age, serum creatinine, plasma renin level,
SYNTAX score and plaque score were found to be posi-
tively correlated with carotid IMT. Age, serum creatinine,
hs-CRP, plasma renin level and SYNTAX score were also
found to be positively correlated with carotid plaque score.
However, ARR was inversely associated with carotid IMT
and plaque score (Table 2).
Predictors of CAD patients with carotid plaques
and thickened carotid IMT
As shown in Table 3, the unadjusted and adjusted odds
ratios associated with the plasma renin levels for predic-
tion of CAD patients with carotid plaques were 1.132 and
1.124 (p = 0.015 and 0.017, respectively). The unadjusted
and adjusted odds ratios associated with the ARR for pre-
diction of CAD patients with carotid plaques were 0.906
and 0.906 (p = 0.010 and 0.011, respectively). As shown
in Table 4, the odds ratios associated with the plasma
renin levels and ARR for prediction of CAD patients with
thickened carotid IMT were insignificant. However, hs-
CRP was a significant predictor of thickened carotid IMT
after adjustment for age (odds ratio 5.441, 95% CI 1.052­
28.131, p = 0.043). The areas under the ROC curves for
the plasma aldosterone and renin to predict the CAD
patients with carotid plaques were 0.636 and 0.738,
respectively (Figure 2(a)). The area under the ROC curve
for the plasma ARR to predict CAD patients without
1162 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
carotid plaque was 0.679 (Figure 2(b)). These results indi-
cated that decrease in ARR was associated with higher
carotid plaque score in patients with CAD. When we set
the cutoff value to predict the presence of CAD patients
with carotid plaques to a plasma renin level of 8.5 pg/ml,
the sensitivity and specificity were 68.8% and 62.5%,
respectively. In contrast, when we set the cutoff value to
predict the presence of CAD patients without carotid
plaque to a plasma ARR of 8.0, the sensitivity and speci-
ficity were 68.8% and 61.7%, respectively.

Discussion
In this cross-sectional study, we examined the relationship
between RAAS and carotid atherosclerosis in stable CAD
patients. Our results demonstrated that plasma renin levels
and ARR are independently associated with presence of
carotid plaques. In addition, hs-CRP is independently
associated with carotid IMT in CAD patients. These results
indicated that plasma renin may have important effects on
the formation of carotid atherosclerosis in CAD patients,
and plasma renin suppressed by aldosterone (higher ARR)
might be a relevant anti-atherogenic indicator in these
patients. This study also disclosed that detection of carotid
plaques is not infrequent in aged patients with stable CAD.
Carotid plaques were present in 60% of CAD patients.
These patients had significantly higher hs-CRP and thicker
carotid IMT than the remaining patients with CAD. In
these patients with carotid plaques, plasma renin levels

were in a normal/high-normal range and aldosterone levels
were in a high-normal range, suggesting that inflammation
and renin escape from suppression by aldosterone excess
caused carotid vascular damage and plaque formation in
CAD patients.
Although animal studies indicated that aldosterone
might cause important vascular inflammation and dam-
age,22,23 the clinical evidence supporting a direct role of
aldosterone as a potential contributor to vascular dysfunc-
tion or cardiovascular events is still limited. A simple
model to assess possible detrimental effects of aldosterone
on the vasculature is primary aldosteronism in which
patients experienced more cardiovascular events than did
patients with essential hypertension.24 Patients with pri-
mary aldosteronism also have increased common carotid
IMT compared to the patients with essential hyperten-
sion.25 It is well known that aldosterone has direct effects
on the vasculature and has been associated with vascular
smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction,
cardiac fibrosis, proteinuria, and renal vascular injury.26
Clinical trials have proven the benefit of aldosterone
receptor antagonism. Treatments that block the pathologic
effects of the RAAS at several points have been shown to
limit target-organ damage in hypertension and to decrease

cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.27 These study
results proved the important role of aldosterone in the
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, an observation
study had showed that the overall prevalence of carotid
artery lesions was not significantly different between
patients with primary aldosteronism and primary hyper-
tension.28 Although the studied population differed from
our cohort, we have also showed that plasma aldosterone
levels are not significantly associated with carotid athero-
sclerosis in this high-risk population.
The prognostic value of plasma renin for cardiovascu-
lar events is also controversial. In a community-based
cohort, renin, aldosterone and ARR were not associated
with all-cause mortality in hypertensive individuals.29
However, plasma renin concentration is associated with
an increased risk for cardiovascular events regardless of
blood pressure according to a community-based cohort
study.30 To date, studies focusing on the relationship
between carotid atherosclerotic plaques and ARR are
scarce. Only one study evaluating the association of vas-
cular damage and ARR in hypertensive children was
reported.31 The results showed that there was a positive
association between carotid IMT and ARR but not serum
aldosterone concentration or plasma renin activity in
hypertensive children. However, our results showed that
ARR was inversely associated with carotid IMT and

plaque score, and plasma renin was positively associated
with carotid IMT and plaque score in CAD patients.
Carotid IMT and plaque score are not related to plasma
aldosterone concentration. The associations between
plasma renin and ARR and carotid IMT disappeared after
adjustment of confounding factors (Table 4). The discrep-
ancy in these two studies can be explained by the
extremely different selected populations. Moreover, sev-
eral studies have showed that the ultrasound assessment
of carotid plaque, compared with that of carotid IMT, had
a higher diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of future
ischemic stroke and CAD events.32­35 Hence, plasma
renin level and ARR might have significant prognostic
values in stable CAD patients. Carotid plaque was a
stronger predictor of coronary events than IMT and is
more strongly associated with coronary stenosis than
IMT.32,36 Carotid IMT is biologically distinct from carotid
plaque, and from a pathological point of view, IMT is not
really atherosclerosis, but another phenotype.33,34
There were several limitations in the present study.
First, we studied a relatively small group of consecutive
patients who were referred for coronary angiography
because of stable angina pectoris and suspected CAD.
Hence, the findings of our analyses in these CAD patients
may not be extrapolated to a broader population such as
patients with acute coronary syndrome. Second, the mean
age of our patients was relatively high. The prevalence of
multi-vessel CAD was much higher in advanced age, and
the extent of CAD was affected by the integration of coro-
nary risk factors including age and other risk factors. These
selection biases could mean that our findings regarding the
relationship between ARR and carotid plaque score are
relevant only to this specific group and may not be appli-
cable to the general population.
In conclusion, escape of plasma renin from suppres-
sion by relatively high plasma aldosterone levels repre-
sented by high plasma renin and low ARR might be a
marker of structural vascular damage. This phenomenon
occurs as a consequence of RAAS-mediated vascular
injury and pinpoints marked atherosclerosis in coronary
and carotid arteries. Identification of high renin and low
ARR is important to identify patients with concomitant
severe CAD and carotid atherosclerosis. More research
is needed to identify the determinants of carotid athero-
sclerotic risk and to assess the best treatment strategy to
decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CAD
patients.
