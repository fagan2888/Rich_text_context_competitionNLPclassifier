How do we climb Maslow's pyramid? It is now 70 years
since Maslow (1943a) proposed his theory of human adult
motivation as the process of satisfying needs arranged in
hierarchical levels of prepotency, now often simplified to the
visual image of a pyramid. For Maslow, adults were a driven
"wanting animal" (Maslow, 1943a, p. 87) until their needs
were satisfied. Maslow however did not provide a means for
satisfying those unfilled needs and from this author's
research neither did he produce the iconic pyramid image.
Referring back to Maslow's original papers, the closest indi-
cation of a pyramid hierarchy appears to be
for the sake of illustration, it is as if the average citizen is
satisfied perhaps 85 per cent in his physiological needs, 70 per
cent in his safety needs, 50 per cent in his love needs, 40 per cent
in his self-esteem needs, and 10 per cent in his self-actualization
needs. (Maslow, 1943b, pp. 388-389)
When an image such as the pyramid image is used to
describe a process, that image becomes a diagram, and ulti-
mately for a diagram to work the meaning of the original idea
and the visual representation must be maintained. Yet the
pyramid diagram goes further than Maslow proposed by
constraining the theory within a framework of solid lines and
textures that compartmentalize each needs stage into distinct
tiers. These subsequent additions are not acting as separators
but boundaries, generating false mental representations that
may hinder an adult's ability to recognize the early appear-
ance of satisfied or emergent needs. Furthermore, without
the support of an appropriate mental model, adults can fail to
solve problems effectively. This is supported from numerous
studies that show that adults who consider they cannot per-
form a task, such as walking up stairs, do not try (Warren &
Whang, 1987) or when they do not see the action potential of
a horizontal door handle, do not see the potential to open the
door (Tipper, Paul, & Hayes, 2006). Considered together it is
questionable that the pyramid of needs as a diagram ade-
quately represents Maslow's theory of motivation.
In devising a diagram for Maslow's needs hierarchy, we
must avoid creating mental barriers that could discourage a
person from believing they can pass from one level of the
hierarchy to the next. It should also provide a means of show-
ing the degree of needs satiety at each stage and offer support
in developing unsatisfied needs by identifying the develop-
mental needs that will aid an owner's ascension through the
hierarchy. However, a problem lies in how a person can first
access their own needs hierarchy to assess their levels of
needs satiety. To address this, we can use a new technology
called Emergent Feature Displays (EID; Vicente &
Rasmussen, 1992) to provide a direct perceptual interface
between a person and their own hierarchy of needs.
The Ecological Interface (EI) Effect
EI displays work by showing the results in the form of a
shape instead of displaying the results of data searches as
bits of related information for a person to mentally manipu-
late. An example of the EI effect is when we purchase a
large product over the Internet, but when a small package
arrives we can immediately see that it does not contain our

Climbing the Needs Pyramids
J. C. Lomas1
Abstract
Abraham Maslow's theory of human adult motivation is often represented by a pyramid image showing two proposals: First,
the five needs stages in emergent order of hierarchical ascension and second, a percentage of the adult population suggested
to occupy each needs tier. Specifically, Maslow proposed that adults would be motivated to satisfy their unfilled needs
until they reached the hierarchy's apex and achieved self-transcendence. Yet how adults can purposefully ascend Maslow's
pyramid through satisfying unfilled needs remains elusive. This brief article challenges this on the theory's 70th anniversary by
presenting a new image of the needs hierarchy, based on ecological design principles to support adults' purposeful endeavors
to climb the needs pyramid.

purchase because the package is too small. Preliminary
investigations suggest that such direct perception may be
useful when looking for patterns in data, such as the early
identification of cardiovascular disease (McEwen, Flach, &
Elder, 2012) and anesthesia monitoring in noisy operating
rooms (Watson, Russell, & Sanderson, 2007). Hazardous
areas are also suggested to benefit from the EI effect where
operators need to be able to quickly assimilate operational
status, such as the petrochemical industry (Jamieson, 2002),
military tactical operations (Hall, Shattuck, & Bennett,
2012), and in nuclear power stations (Kim, Suh, Jang, Hong,
& Park, 2012). Hall et al. (2012) go further and suggest that
in their study of tactical commanders (N = 16) who com-
pleted reports using information taken from either tradi-
tional or EI displays, not only were EID reports completed
faster and with more accuracy, but the EI went further, sup-
porting participants' decision making and evoking their
expertise. One account for this is that EID supports the deci-
sion-making process by not drawing heavily on an opera-
tor's limited cognitive resources as the task becomes more
cognitively challenging (Vicente & Rasmussen, 1992). The
aviation sector is another emerging area where EID is con-
sidered useful as pilots are not able to see the operational
status of their aircraft when airborne and rely on instruments
to provide in-flight status information. Coekin (1969) pro-
duced a feature display that was adapted by Dinadis and
Vicente (1999) as part of a new instrument panel providing
pilots with functional and overall status of an aircraft's
engines when in flight. It is an adaptation of this display that
forms the basis for a person to see their hierarchy of needs
and measure needs satiety.
The Design
Figure 1 shows an adaptation of Dinadis and Vicente's (1999)
prototype instrument display that was developed on EI
design principles for pilots to monitor the in-flight health of
the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft's engines.
The star diagrams (Coekin, 1969) in the top row show
each engine's current operational performance through a
dynamic status line superimposed onto a static octagon dia-
gram incorporated into the display. Each axis represents a
predefined subsection of an engine's operating parameter
(e.g., fuel, oil, air, etc.) with colored tick marks along the
length indicating degrees of alarm should the parameter fail.
More tick marks extend the star diagram's outer rim
mark indicating the engine's safety envelope, the engine's
utmost functional capability before capacity thresholds are
breached. Each engine has its own state diagram in the shape
of a trapezium below it that shows the engine's higher order
performance parameters, for example, 0 to 1 Heat, 1 to 2
Wind flow, and so on. As shown in Figure 1. Engine 1 is
performing as expected, and therefore, its star diagram and
state diagrams are symmetrical. However, Engine 2 is func-
tioning outside operational expectations, and therefore, the
superimposed line in the star diagram has moved toward the
errant parameter's axis alarm tick thus incurring loss of
shape symmetry. The color of the entire polygon then
changes to the same color as the most acute alarm tick iden-
tified by the status line. Simultaneously that engine's state
diagram loses shape symmetry in a manner indicative of the
engine's overall health. For example, in Figure 1, Engine 2
shows some problem with the temperature and air so the
corresponding state diagram below shows a loss of shape
symmetry between the higher order stages 4 to 5--the tur-
bines output.
It is the principles used here to monitor the aircraft's in-
flight health that form the basis and process for adults to
climb Maslow's pyramid.
Climbing the Needs Pyramid
Figure 2 is the same engine display adapted to reflect
Maslow's (1943a) original hierarchy of needs. Now pre-
sented as a computer or phone application, Engine 1 is
replaced by a circular hierarchy of needs sectioned into five
segments, each representing one stage in the needs hierarchy.
The outer rim tick marks have been removed to encourage
adults to apply their resources only within the circle.
The solid axes that previously displayed the engine's
functional parameters are now serrated; acting as a scale to
show the satisfaction of each needs components and, as a
visual prompt to remind the owner of the transferability of
learned skills and the dynamic manner of needs satiety. A
centrally placed traffic light system with subdued amber and
red color coding now functions to alert, not alarm, the owner
of concerning unsatisfied needs per stage. Engine 2 is
replaced by a current task circle to show the owner's

self-perceived assessment of their top-down endeavors to fill
their bottom-up unsatisfied needs identified in the needs
hierarchy. The state trapezium shape is replaced by Maslow's
pyramid to provide a visual overview of the owner's self-
perceived degree of needs satiety with their current develop-
mental stage highlighted.
Figure 2 shows one possible distribution of Maslow's
illustration of the average person's satisfied needs mentioned
earlier. Typically figures would be provided by the owner
who chooses what percentage they believe each component
of a need is satisfied gained from a needs satisfaction check-
list (the appendix). Percentages are then ranked with the
highest and lowest figures shown between the relevant needs
segment's axes. This is a departure from Dinadis & Vicente's
display that shows the engine's functional status on one axis.
However, by using the space between the axes we can now
reveal the functional behavior of the needs components--the
developmental needs. The emergent feature now shows the
owner's hierarchy of needs and the owner's concern of each
stage's component needs. These color-coded results are then
transferred to the hierarchy of needs pyramid below that now
acts as the owner's state diagram.
In Figure 2, we can see from the shape's loss of symmetry
into the amber alert zone that there is a needs component in
the Safety needs stage that is causing the owner concern. The
owner however is not obliged to satisfy this need and is free
to choose which outstanding needs to develop based on need
motivation, the position of the superimposed line to an alert
zone, what resources are available (from the checklist), and
personal desires. Nevertheless the EI effect is supporting the
owner in their choice of which needs stage to address by
drawing their attention to the alert. Identifying which partic-
ular component is generating the alert (security of employ-
ment) can then be gained from the checklist. If the owner
chooses to remove the threat causing the amber alert they
could draw on their "security of resources" component, and
perhaps choose to enroll on an educational course to enhance
their job prospects with the support from their spouse, Stage
3--Love needs.
Once enrolled Student Services or the Internet can pro-
vide the important variables involved in successful study,
that is, library skills, efficient note taking, and so on, which
are then added one variable per segment to the current task
circle. The number of segments in the task circle can be

Note. The state diagram is now a typical hierarchy of needs pyramid showing needs deficits by stage, stage significance, and self-perceived degree of concern.

increased or reduced as required to accommodate the amount
of key variables necessary for success. Each academic term
can then be time-tabled on Pareto principles and incorpo-
rated into a countdown organizer such as the Franklin
Planner, Gantt chart, or a similar Student's Services initia-
tive. Figure 2 also shows the emergent feature extending the
circle rim suggesting excessive resources are being allocated
to one segment while another segment is approaching the
amber alert, for example, procrastination. Suitable progress
is gained by the owner trying to regain circle symmetry
throughout their course by adhering to the important variable
requirements for their chosen task and, in achieving this,
moves them away from the central alerting zones.
Another scenario for Figure 2 could be that of an obese
owner who agrees their Safety needs are not satisfied yet
chooses to develop their Esteem needs (self-esteem) that
also benefits their Safety needs (affordable health insur-
ance) by incorporating key variables identified with suc-
cessful weight loss onto the task circle, that is, exercise,
food choices, counseling, and so on. Alternatively, Figure 2
could be that of an individual employee in the workplace
who wants to satisfy their Love needs so attends the organi-
zations' health and fitness initiatives, boosting their group
membership component and also perceived job security
(Safety need). According to Maslow once the owner's unsat-
isfied needs start being filled new needs in the next stage of
the hierarchy emerge and so the cycle of redrawing the cir-
cle of needs, identifying the new emergent features then
choosing tasks to satisfy those needs restarts at a higher tier
of the hierarchy and so forth till the owner reaches the apex.
Keeping needs satisfied so as not to descend the pyramid
requires following chosen task requirements, for example,
clients attend all scheduled therapy appointments, students
passing all academic assignments, or an employee's sus-
tained better time-keeping practices. In this manner, an
adult's path through the needs hierarchy is guided and not
dictated, by the internal traffic light system, the location of
the deviation from shape symmetry, the results from the
checklist, what is meaningful to the owner, and the resources
they have available.
However, there are limitations that need further investiga-
tion, for example, we know more about the lower hierarchi-
cal needs than the higher stage needs that may restrict the
owner's choice of needs components as they rise through the
checklist. Another consideration is what impact is there on a
person's ability to effectively problem solve now the devel-
opmental and deficiency needs are incorporated into the EI
effect. Moreover, the owner must estimate what percentage
they think each need is satisfied, unlike that of an aircraft
engine where every part and its functioning are known and
fed directly into the display. Clearly then this presentation
will need further investigation; however, it suggests an alter-
native view of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the process by
which people could ascend the needs hierarchy and offers
further opportunities to empirically measure needs satiety
and human motivation.
