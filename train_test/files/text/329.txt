Studying the relation between the residential environment and health requires valid, reliable, and cost-effective
methods to collect data on residential environments. This 2002 study compared the level of agreement between
measures of the presence of neighborhood businesses drawn from 2 common sources of data used for research
on the built environment and health: listings of businesses from commercial databases and direct observations of
city blocks by raters. Kappa statistics were calculated for 6 types of businesses--drugstores, liquor stores, bars,
convenience stores, restaurants, and grocers--located on 1,663 city blocks in Chicago, Illinois. Logistic regres-
sions estimated whether disagreement between measurement methods was systematically correlated with the
socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of neighborhoods. Levels of agreement between the 2 sources
were relatively high, with significant (P < 0.001) kappa statistics for each business type ranging from 0.32 to 0.70.
Most business types were more likely to be reported by direct observations than in the commercial database
listings. Disagreement between the 2 sources was not significantly correlated with the socioeconomic and de-
mographic characteristics of neighborhoods. Results suggest that researchers should have reasonable confidence
using whichever method (or combination of methods) is most cost-effective and theoretically appropriate for their
research design.

The association between neighborhood context and
health is well documented. For example, residents living
in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have
an increased risk of chronic health conditions such as obe-
sity (1, 2), respiratory problems (3, 4), and coronary heart
disease (5, 6), independent of individual risks. Additionally,
residents in these neighborhoods have higher rates of smok-
ing (7), poor nutrition (8, 9), and physical inactivity (7, 10­
12). However, to provide better guidance on how policy
interventions can address neighborhood health disparities,
research must focus on more specific aspects of neighbor-
hood environments that lead to increased health risks and
unhealthy behaviors.
Until recently, researchers have relied mainly on census-
based measures to assess associations between neighbor-
hood characteristics and health (13­15), but they have
increasingly turned to other methods to measure aspects
of neighborhoods that are more theoretically linked to spe-
cific health outcomes. Two common sources of data on such
neighborhood mechanisms are 1) spatially referenced sec-
ondary sources of data collected for other purposes (e.g.,
administrative data or market research data) and 2) direct
observations of the physical and social environment made
through systematic social observation (SSO) (16).
Secondary data sources, such as market research data-
bases and municipal registries, can be very useful for mea-
suring aspects of the environment related to the availability
of food, exercise facilities, and health care (17­20). One
advantage to using secondary data sources is that they usu-
ally provide complete geographic coverage of the area under
study (e.g., all the stores that sell food in a city or metro-
politan area), sometimes for a very limited cost. However,
609 Am J Epidemiol 2010;171:609­617
many health-relevant aspects of neighborhoods are not mea-
sured in secondary data sources--such as the level of dis-
order, the condition of buildings and recreational areas, and
the type and price of food sold in local stores--so re-
searchers often turn to other sources of contextual data.
Direct SSO of the neighborhood environment allows re-
searchers to measure constructs not commonly found in
secondary data sources by using a field instrument tailored
to their needs (21­23). This method is usually more costly
because it requires training raters and paying for their time,
but it can be performed by survey interviewers who are
already in the field, at a relatively low marginal cost. An
important limitation to using SSO is that geographic cover-
age is typically more limited than it is with secondary data
because researchers must pay for rater training and trans-
portation to the sites being observed.
Both of these options represent promising alternatives to
census data, but there are important unanswered questions
concerning the ``ecometric'' properties of neighborhood-
level measures constructed from such data sources, includ-
ing issues of reliability, validity, and whether measures
drawn from either source are more or less reliable or valid
in certain types of neighborhoods (13, 24, 25). Although
there is no ``gold standard'' for measuring neighborhood
characteristics against which to compare measures from
secondary data or SSO, we can begin to address these ques-
tions by assessing the level of agreement between equivalent
measures derived from each method.
Another measurement concern that can be addressed em-
pirically is whether the level of agreement between the 2
sources varies systematically across neighborhoods (26).
For example, research has shown that people living in dis-
advantaged areas with few grocery stores are at higher risk
of obesity (27, 28). If, however, a study relies on secondary
data that fail to capture smaller businesses such as ``mom-
and-pop stores,'' and disadvantaged neighborhoods are
more likely to have these smaller businesses (28, 29), then
the observed relation between lack of grocers and obesity
may be an artifact of undercounting small stores in areas
where obesity rates are highest. Systematic measurement
error could also result from the potential failure of market
research databases to count businesses in the ``informal
economy'' or to include businesses that have recently
closed, both of which could be more common in poorer
neighborhoods. Likewise, SSO raters may make errors
translating signs from other languages or not identifying
multiple types of businesses at a single location.
In this study, we used 2 different data sources on the
presence of stores that sell food or beverages in Chicago,
Illinois, neighborhoods: a major market research database
and an SSO covering the same time period. In this paper, we
first assess the level of agreement between these 2 data
sources at the block level, focusing on stores that sell food
or beverages because proximity to these establishments has
been suggested as one mechanism linking the residential
environment to individual diet and health (18, 19, 27, 28,
30, 31). We also assess whether the level of disagreement
regarding the presence of food stores between the 2 data
sources is systematically related to the sociodemographic
composition of neighborhoods. To the extent that the dis-
agreement between the 2 sources is not correlated with key
ecologic characteristics (e.g., those conventionally used in
neighborhood-effects research), researchers can be more
confident in using either method to explore the mechanisms
that could help explain why neighborhoods matter for
health.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SSO data
Our observational data came from an SSO conducted as
part of the Chicago Community Adult Health Study, a mul-
tistage area probability sample of 3,105 adults living in the
city of Chicago (32). Each block on which one or more
sampled residents lived was rated by trained observers.
Raters were asked to walk around the perimeter of each
block twice--once on the interior perimeter, including the
block face on which the sampled resident lived, and once on
the exterior perimeter, including the block face across the
street from where the sampled resident lived--and to record
their observations on a rating form. The rating form asked
the raters to indicate only whether a given business type was
present; raters were not asked to count the number of busi-
nesses, houses, or street features that they observed.
Observations were made between May 2001 and March
2003 on a total of 1,663 blocks in the city of Chicago sam-
pled to be representative of all blocks in the city that contain
residential housing (32). Each block is located in one of 343
neighborhood clusters, defined in previous studies and con-
sisting of one or more geographically contiguous census
tracts that follow major ecologic boundaries with relatively
homogenous populations and comprise the entire area of the
city of Chicago (33). Two observers rated 80 of the blocks to
determine the interrater reliability for each item in the in-
strument; kappa statistics for interrater reliability of items
measuring the presence of food and beverage stores ranged
from j ¼ 0.37 (supermarkets) to j ¼ 1.00 (drugstores). We
evaluated whether any of the following types of business
establishments were present on the block: drugstores, con-
venience stores, liquor stores, bars, fast-food restaurants,
other restaurants, greengrocers/delicatessens, and grocery
stores/supermarkets. The definitions that raters used to code
these establishments are presented in Table 1, along with
interrater kappa statistics based on the 80 double-rated
blocks for each business type. If a business could be cate-
gorized into multiple business categories (e.g., a bar and
a restaurant), raters were instructed to code both business
types as present on the block.
Proprietary commercial establishment data
The proprietary data were purchased from InfoUSA
(Omaha, Nebraska), a commercial vendor that tracks busi-
nesses and provides business listings based on the North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes,
a standard created and used by government agencies to cat-
egorize businesses. This proprietary data set lists 23,868
businesses that had 1) addresses in the city of Chicago dur-
ing November 2002, a month chosen because 84% of the
610 Bader et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2010;171:609­617
SSOs were collected within 3 months on either side of that
month; and 2) NAICS codes that identified them as drug-
stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, bars, fast-food res-
taurants, other restaurants, greengrocers/delicatessens, or
grocery stores/supermarkets. Definitions of these business
categories and their corresponding NAICS codes are listed
in Table 1, along with the number of such establishments in
the proprietary data across all sampled blocks. Each estab-
lishment could identify itself with up to 4 NAICS codes. We
classified a business as belonging to a specific food/bever-
age store category if at least one of the reported NAICS
codes was in the food/beverage store category (establish-
ments with multiple NAICS codes were classified into mul-
tiple business categories). Although the data proprietor
provides a new list of businesses each month, it does not
provide documentation regarding the frequency with which
individual listings are verified; the lack of such information
is a major disadvantage in using these data.
The data set included addresses and geographic coordi-
nates for each business. After inspecting the data, we found
small discrepancies between the coordinates provided by
the data proprietor and the coordinates obtained by geo-
coding the addresses ourselves. Since the proprietor did not
document the specific procedures used to obtain geo-
graphic coordinates for businesses, we geocoded the ad-
dresses of all of the 23,868 businesses using US Census
Bureau TIGER/Line files (http://www.census.gov/geo
/www/tiger/) and ArcGIS version 9.2 software (ESRI, Red-
lands, California). We were unable to obtain geocoded co-
ordinates for 1,019 businesses. We conducted the analysis
1) without these observations (which we report in the ta-
bles) and 2) with the proprietor-provided coordinates for
these observations, and we found no significant variation in
our results.
Creating comparability between data sets
We used a multistep process to construct comparable
measures across the 2 data sources. The first step created
comparable business categories by matching the instruc-
tions used by the SSO raters to the NAICS codes used to
classify businesses in the proprietary data. This step re-
quired collapsing some categories in both data sources. Ta-
ble 1 provides the business categories used in the analysis
and how they are defined in each data source.
Since the availability of fast-food restaurants has been
considered particularly important to the health of residents
(19, 30, 34), we also created 2 subcategories of restaurants:
fast-food restaurants and ``other eating places.'' The ``fast-
food'' category in the SSO data was compared with the
``limited-service restaurants'' category (NAICS code
722110) in the proprietary data (refer to Table 1 for more
detail), whereas the ``other eating places'' category from the
SSO (which captured any non-fast-food restaurant in the
SSO) was compared with a roughly analogous category in
the proprietary data that we created by counting the pres-
ence of any of the following: a ``full-service restaurant''
(NAICS code 722211), a ``snack and beverage'' establish-
ment (NAICS code 722213), or a bakery (NAICS code
311811).
The next step involved creating geographically compara-
ble units of analysis. The SSO was conducted on only 1,663
of the approximately 24,000 blocks in Chicago, and we had
to ensure that we were using the same blocks with the pro-
prietary data. We used geographic information systems soft-
ware to create polygons that represented the blocks
observed by SSO raters and matched a business from the
proprietary data to a polygon if the geographic coordinates
were inside the polygon. A business category was coded as
being present on the block if at least one business in that
category was inside the block boundary; otherwise, it was
coded as not present. In the final step, the block-level mea-
sures from the proprietary database were merged with the
SSO database, resulting in a combined database that con-
tained measures from both data sources of whether each
business category was present on each block.
Analytic strategy
To measure the correspondence between the 2 data sour-
ces, kappa statistics were calculated for the 8 business types.
The kappa statistic is a measure of intersource reliability,
defined as the ratio of the observed agreement to the ex-
pected agreement (i.e., the level of agreement that could be
expected by chance, based on the marginal frequencies in
both data sources) (35). We then assessed whether disagree-
ment between the 2 data sources is systematically associated
with the sociodemographic characteristics of neighborhoods
by fitting logistic regression models that estimate the log-
odds of finding disagreement (a dichotomous variable)
about the presence of a given business type on a block.
Independent variables measuring the sociodemographic
characteristics of neighborhoods were constructed from
Summary File 3 of the 2000 US Census (http://factfinder.
census.gov/). We constructed a disadvantage scale (a ¼
0.94) by taking the mean of the z-score values of the fol-
lowing variables: percentage of households with annual in-
comes of less than $15,000, percentage of households with
annual incomes of $50,000 or less, percentage of families
living in poverty, percentage of households receiving public
assistance, percentage unemployed, percentage of female-
headed households, percentage of never-married persons,
and percentage of owner-occupied households (reverse
coded). The variables used to construct this scale were se-
lected based on a factor analysis of census tract data con-
ducted for previous research (32).
Two variables were included to capture the influence of
racial/ethnic composition on disagreement: the neighbor-
hood percentage non-Hispanic white and a Hispanic/foreign
born scale, which is the mean of the z-score values of the
percentage of Hispanics and percentage foreign born (a ¼
0.86). We also included the percentage of residents who
lived in the same house for 5 years and the logged popula-
tion per square kilometer to measure residential stability
and population density, respectively.
To control for the geographic location of blocks in the city
of Chicago, which is likely to influence business patterns, we
included a measure of distance from the Loop--Chicago's
central business district--operationalized as a block's dis-
tance in kilometers from the Sears Tower. To account for

Drugstores Drugstores/pharmacy (interrater j ¼ 1.00): all drugstores, including large
drugstore chains (e.g., Walgreens, Osco) that sell a wide variety of other
merchandise. Count any store that provides a pharmacy for prescription
medication.
446110: Pharmacies and drugstores engaged in retailing prescription or
nonprescription drugs and medicines.
Drugstores on sampled blocks: 89
Liquor stores Liquor store (interrater j ¼ 0.36): includes any store that has alcohol as its
primary merchandise. They may be of supermarket size or very small.
Stores that sell alcohol with a range of foodstuffs would be considered
supermarkets or convenience stores.
445310: Stores retailing packaged alcoholic beverages, such as ale, beer,
wine, and liquor.
Liquor stores on sampled blocks: 93
Bars Bar/cocktail lounge (interrater j ¼ 0.77): includes places where the alcohol
that is sold is consumed on the premises, and this is its main purpose,
even if food is also provided. A ``wine bar'' would be included under this
heading although they often offer a variety of meals. To qualify as a bar, it
must be possible to obtain alcohol without also purchasing food.
722410: Bars, taverns, nightclubs, or drinking places primarily engaged in
preparing and serving alcoholic beverages for immediate consumption.
These establishments may also provide limited food services.
Bars on sampled blocks: 181
Convenience stores 7-Eleven/convenience store (interrater j ¼ 0.61): includes small
supermarkets open 18 to 24 hours selling a wide range of products
including newspapers, food, small household items, toys, and stationery.
Such stores may be part of a chain (e.g., White Hen Pantry, 7-Eleven) or
privately owned. They may also be part of a gasoline service station if
they sell a range of goods beyond just cigarettes, candy, and soft drinks.
445120: Convenience stores or food marts (except those with fuel pumps)
primarily engaged in retailing a limited line of goods that generally
includes milk, bread, soda, and snacks.
447110: Gasoline stations in combination with convenience store or food
marts.
Convenience stores on sampled blocks: 137
Restaurants Fast-food/take-out place (interrater j ¼ 0.64): includes chains (e.g.,
McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell) and restaurants offering
only a limited range of ``fast-food'' items, such as pizza houses. This
category includes sandwich bars, small coffee shops with limited
seating, establishments that only have a take-out trade (e.g., some
Chinese food, kebab houses), and any other eating place where no more
than 2 or 3 people could linger to eat.
722211: Establishments primarily engaged in providing food services
(except snack and nonalcoholic beverage bars) where patrons generally
order or select items and pay before eating. Food and drink may be
consumed on premises, taken out, or delivered to customers' location.
Some establishments in this industry may provide these food services in
combination with selling alcoholic beverages. providing take-out
services, or presenting live nontheatrical entertainment.
Restaurants (fast-food) on sampled blocks: 941
Other eating place/restaurant (interrater j ¼ 0.52): includes restaurants
that have both take-out and eat-in services and restaurants where the
space available for eating on the premises is greater than the space for
customers to line up and wait for ``take-out'' items, except for fast-food
chains (e.g., McDonalds), which are in the previous category.
722110: Establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to
patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress
service) and pay after eating. These establishments may provide this
type of food service to patrons in combination with selling alcoholic
beverages.
To be considered an eating establishment, food should be the principal
offering, or nonalcoholic beverages (e.g., coffee shops that provide
seating and tables and also some food such as doughnuts, coffee cake,
pastries, etc.)
722213: Snack and beverage: Establishments primarily engaged in 1)
preparing and/or serving a specialty snack, such as ice cream, frozen
yogurt, cookies, or popcorn or 2) serving nonalcoholic beverages, such
as coffee, juices, or sodas for consumption on or near the premises.
These establishments may carry and sell a combination of snack,
nonalcoholic beverage, and other related products (e.g., coffee beans,
mugs, coffee makers) but generally promote and sell a unique snack or
nonalcoholic beverage.

differences in when blocks were rated in the SSO, we con-
trolled for the difference (in months) between the date the
block was observed and November 2002, the month for
which the proprietary data were obtained. All analyses were
conducted by using Stata version 9.2 software (Stata Corpo-
ration, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
The results of the correspondence analysis are reported in
Table 2. The rate of agreement between the SSO and pro-
prietary data was quite high, ranging from 82% (for fast-
food restaurants and supermarkets or grocers) to 96% (for
drugstores). Restaurants had the highest intersource reliabil-
ity (j ¼ 0.70), convenience and liquor stores and ``other''
(non-fast-food) eating places had the lowest (j ¼ 0.32­
0.38), and the other categories (drugstores, bars, fast-food
restaurants, and grocery stores) had levels of agreement
(range of j ¼ 0.44­0.49) that were above convenience
and liquor stores and ``other'' (non-fast-food) eating places
but well below restaurants.
To better understand the nature of disagreement between
the 2 data sources, we cross-tabulated measurements from
each source and report, in Table 2, the frequency of blocks
on which 1) both data sets agreed that the business type is
present, 2) both agreed that it is not present, 3) only the SSO
data source indicated that the business type is present, and 4)
only the proprietary data source indicated that the business
type is present. The results show that, where disagreement
occurred, it was more often the case that a business type was
recorded in the SSO but not the proprietary data, especially
in the case of liquor and convenience stores. Exceptions
included drugstores, grocery stores, and especially fast-food
restaurants (where the NAICS definition is more inclusive),
which were reported slightly to moderately more frequently
in the proprietary data than in the SSO.
Odds ratios estimated from the logistic regressions of
block disagreement are reported in Table 3. The major find-
ing was the lack of a consistent relation between the socio-
demographic characteristics of neighborhoods and the odds
of the 2 data sources disagreeing. Of the 40 socioeconomic
and demographic coefficients that we estimated, only 9 were
statistically significant. Three of the outcomes (all restau-
rants, fast-food restaurants, and supermarkets) had no sig-
nificant sociodemographic predictors, and another 3
outcomes (drugstores, liquor stores, and bars) had only
one significant sociodemographic predictor. The sociode-
mographic variables associated with disagreement were 1)
proportion white (associated with more disagreement on
non-fast-food restaurants), 2) the Hispanic/foreign-born
scale (associated with more disagreement on bars and
non-fast-food restaurants), 3) the disadvantage scale (asso-
ciated with more disagreement on liquor stores), 4) the res-
idential stability scale (associated with less disagreement on
drugstores, convenience stores, and non-fast-food restau-
rants), and 5) population density (associated with more dis-
agreement on convenience stores and non-fast-food
restaurants).
The nature and direction of the observed sociodemo-
graphic effects for each type of establishment seem
Supermarkets or grocers Supermarket/grocery store (interrater j ¼ 0.36): includes stores that sell
predominantly foodstuffs and small household items. The size of
supermarkets may vary. Include large supermarkets (e.g., Jewel,
Dominics) and also smaller food supermarkets. Some of these will be
open 24 hours a day but they are distinguished from ``convenience
stores'' by the fact that they provide a wider range of items.
445110: Establishments generally known as supermarkets and grocery
stores primarily engaged in retailing a general line of food, such as
canned and frozen foods; fresh fruits and vegetables; and fresh and
prepared meats, fish, and poultry. Included in this industry are
delicatessen-type establishments.
Greengrocer/delicatessen (interrater j ¼ 0.52): includes ``mom-and-pop''
small neighborhood groceries and small specialized food stores, such as
those selling food from one part of the world or one ethnic background, or
health foods/vegetarian food shops. The store should be predominantly
for the purchase of foods that need to be prepared off the premises, NOT
those offering mainly ready prepared food to ``carry out'' (such as
sandwich bars).
445210: Establishments primarily engaged in retailing fresh, frozen, or
cured meats and poultry. Delicatessen-type establishments primarily
engaged in retailing fresh meat are included in this industry.
445220: Establishments primarily engaged in retailing fresh, frozen, or
cured fish and seafood products.
445230: Establishments primarily engaged in retailing fresh fruits and
vegetables.

reasonable, if only marginally more than might occur by
chance. There are no sociodemographic predictors for
large and inclusive categories (all restaurants, all super-
markets/grocery stores) or quite identifiable ones (fast-
food). Findings drawing on the results shown in Tables 2
and 3 showed the following: 1) drugstores are identified
less often via SSOs, with more disagreement in areas of
high residential stability (where NAICS-identified drug-
stores may be ``hidden'' in larger stores); 2) liquor stores
are identified less often in the proprietary data, with more
disagreement in disadvantaged areas (where the proprie-
tary data response rates may be lower for all stores or
especially this type, which may be subject to heightened
law enforcement observation if reported); 3) bars are more
reported via SSOs and with more disagreement in His-
panic areas, where there may again be underreporting
via NAICS; 4) convenience stores are more often reported
via SSO, with more disagreement in dense areas and less
disagreement in residentially stable areas (where they may
be underreported in the proprietary data or more easily
visible via SSO); and 5) other eating places are more often
reported via SSO, with more disagreement in white or
Hispanic areas and denser areas and less disagreement in
stable areas (where the somewhat less inclusive NAICS
categories may generally miss some types of eating estab-
lishments unless the area is very stable).
Distance to the Loop was also associated with less dis-
agreement for 5 outcomes: drugstores, liquor stores, bars,
fast-food restaurants, and supermarkets, likely reflecting
lower commercial density further away from downtown
Chicago (and conversely more purely residential blocks)
and thus fewer opportunities for disagreement to occur (be-
cause there are fewer businesses). We tested this hypothesis
by repeating the models reported in Table 3 using subsam-
ples that contained only those blocks with commercial ac-
tivity. We did not have official data on land-use patterns to
measure commercial activity, so we identified commercial
blocks in 2 ways. First, we constructed a subsample of 1,037
blocks with commercial land use by eliminating blocks
where the SSO rater did not observe any commercial land
use (regardless of whether the proprietary data recorded
a food-related business there). We also constructed a second
subsample of 656 blocks where any of the 6 business types
were reported present on the block in the proprietary data,
even if the SSO raters failed to observe a food-related busi-
ness there. In both subsamples, we found nonsignificant
associations between distance to the Loop and disagreement
for all businesses except bars, but the associations between
the sociodemographic characteristics and the outcomes
were similar to those shown in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
The results of this analysis are promising for researchers
investigating the role of the residential environment on in-
dividual outcomes. Although neither of these 2 data sources
can be taken as a ``gold standard,'' the moderate to high
levels of agreement between the 2 sources suggest that the
presence of commercial establishments in residential neigh-
borhoods is comparably measured across the 2 methods of
data collection. The intersource reliability between the SSO
and proprietary measures is comparable to interrater reli-
abilities obtained for SSO observations (21, 36) and is
higher than the rates of agreement between respondent re-
ports and proprietary databases reported in a prior study
(17).
Across the 6 business types we investigated, we did not
find a consistent pattern of association between sociodemo-
graphic characteristics and disagreement that would lead us
to conclude that one data source consistently differs from
the other in certain types of neighborhoods. The only con-
sistent predictor of disagreement was distance to the Loop:
disagreement was less likely in blocks further away from the
center of the city. Supplementary analysis revealed that this
association disappeared when the sample of blocks was lim-
ited to blocks with commercial establishments. This finding
bolsters our interpretation that distance to the Loop is
a proxy for commercial density, which creates more oppor-
tunity for disagreement simply because there are more busi-
nesses to rate or list.
Most types of businesses were more likely to be reported
on a block by SSO observers than by proprietary business
listings. We suspect that this is partly the result of the

definitions used to classify the different businesses since the
SSO rater instructions generally had more lenient definitions
than the NAICS codes. It is also possible that SSO reports
were more accurate than the proprietary business data list-
ings because raters were able to obtain additional informa-
tion about businesses, such as the merchandise or services
that they sell or produce, by visiting them. Businesses clas-
sify themselves in the proprietary data by using NAICS
categories, but there are no assurances that businesses will
list all of the different categories they could be part of (and
they can list as many as 4 only), and we know nothing about
response rates.
Limitations
Although our results suggest that these data sources pro-
vide reliable estimates of the residential environment, sev-
eral limitations should be noted. First, the SSO instrument
was not designed to count the number of business establish-
ments. Although we were able to compare how well these
data sources capture the presence of businesses, not having
data on the number of businesses meant that we could not
compare measures of business density in neighborhoods.
Future studies should compare both presence and density.
Second, as we mentioned above, the definitions of the 6
business types differed slightly across the 2 data sources.
This difference likely inflated the amount of disagreement
on each block, resulting in conservative assessments of in-
tersource reliability. It also suggests that future studies using
SSO methodology to measure business establishments
should use standard definitions, such as NAICS codes, to
allow for maximum comparability between studies.
Finally, this study examined agreement across only the 2
data sources for 6 business types and examined these types
in only a single city at a single point in time. Although
Chicago has a wide diversity of neighborhoods, these anal-
yses should be extended to other cities and types of residen-
tial environments including suburban and rural
communities. Furthermore, we considered only those blocks
with some residential housing units and hence cannot gen-
eralize our results to blocks with no residential land use.
Thus, although this study provides evidence that the 2 data
sources yield consistent measures of the residential environ-
ment, it represents only a first step in assessing the reliability
between these data sources, and further investigations that
include more items and more geographic locations are war-
ranted. This analysis presents a straightforward strategy that
can be used to assess the reliability of other measurements
across different geographic contexts.
Conclusions
The levels of reliability found between these 2 methods of
data collection suggest that researchers can use measures of
the residential environment derived from either data source
with roughly equal confidence. For studies aiming to char-
acterize the neighborhood food environment, the data sour-
ces provide fairly comparable measures of the types of
establishments present in the neighborhood; therefore, se-
lection of one data source over the other should depend on

the needs of the researcher and the costs and benefits unique
to each method of data collection. For instance, the propri-
etary data provide complete geographic coverage, whereas
the SSO relies on a sample of city blocks; thus, researchers
interested in the total availability or density of food or retail
establishments would probably find the proprietary data
more cost-effective. On the other hand, the SSO provides
researchers with a tool to collect more nuanced measures of
the residential environment such as physical and social dis-
order and can probably make more nuanced distinctions
among establishments because of the opportunity for direct
observation. Where nuanced distinctions are necessary,
these results suggest that SSO might be a more appropriate
method. Therefore, both of these methods of data collection
should be included in the toolkit researchers use to investi-
gate the role of the residential environment on health, and
they can be utilized as alternatives or complements, depend-
ing on the research objectives and financial resources of
investigators.
