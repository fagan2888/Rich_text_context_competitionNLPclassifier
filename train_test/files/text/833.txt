This article measures the racial disparities in home ownership and home equity
among preretirement-aged households. It computes the proportion of the racial gap
explained by discrimination in housing and credit markets. Maximum likelihood and nonlinear
least squares estimates are obtained for models of home ownership probabilities and home
equity, conditional on home ownership, yielding computations for expected home equity for
black and white households. The results reveal an average discriminatory gap in expected
home equity as a percent of the actual gap of 55%. In the top third of the family income
distribution, the measured discriminatory gap is 82%; in the middle third it is 83%;
in the lowest third it is 62%.

Racial Differences in Home
Ownership and Home Equity Among
Preretirement-Aged Households1
Samuel L. Myers, Jr., PhD2 and Chanjin Chung, PhD3
The problem of housing market discrimination and
racial disparities in mortgage lending has taken on a
new level of urgency ("Blacks, Hispanics Remain
Most Likely to Be Denied Home Loans," 1992; Bren-
ner, 1992; Zuckoff, 1992). Researchers and scholars,
as well as federal officials, have begun to reexamine
the underlying structures of mortgage and housing
markets to understand the persistence of racial gaps
in lending (Barefoot, 1992; Boston Federal Reserve,
1992; Myers & Chan, 1995). One particularly dis-
turbing observation is that even during times when
racial gaps in mortgage lending should have been
narrowing -- such as in 1992 when interest rates
began an unprecedented nosedive below double-
digit rates -- the racial gaps persisted (Myers, 1994).
Few minority individuals refinanced their loans dur-
ing this period, even though loan refinancings be-
came the most frequent form of mortgage loan dur-
ing the period (Myers, 1994). Thus, not only were
minority individuals less likely to obtain refinancings
when they applied, they were less likely to apply. At
least for middle-aged borrowers, the impact could
be high debt levels carried into their retirement
years. These high debt levels, along with low home
ownership rates, may help explain the widely cited

evidence of staggering net worth gaps between
blacks and whites in America (Smith, 1993).
Smith computed the net worth of black, Hispanic,
and white families, broken down by family income
quintiles. At the top fifth, the median net worth of
blacks is $130,000. The median net worth of whites in
the top fifth is $290,000. So, at the top of the income
distribution, the net worth of whites is a little more
than twice that of blacks. At the bottom of the distri-
bution, there is a staggering racial gap in wealth.
There, the median net worth of blacks is $100, while
that of whites is $22,400.
Home equity represents one of the most important
components of net worth. Home equity accounted
for 43% of the net worth of households in America in
1988 and 41.9% in 1991 (Eller, 1994). Among blacks,
though, home equity accounted for 63.3% of net
worth in 1991 and 67.6% in 1988. For Hispanics it was
54.9% in 1991 and 58.2% in 1988 (Eller, 1994). But
blacks are considerably less likely than whites to own
a home (Bianci, Farley, & Spain, 1982; Kain & Quig-
ley, 1972; Li, 1977; Long & Caudill, 1992; Megbo-
lugbe & Linneman, 1993). Thus, at least some of the
unequal net worth of blacks likely arises because of
unequal home ownership rates. Financial factors,
low incomes, or short financial planning horizons
might explain both the huge racial disparities in net
worth and the wide racial variations in mortgage
lending outcomes observed in other data sets, such
as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data set.
For example, the most frequently cited reasons for
nonwhites (and blacks in particular) having lower
loan acceptance rates than whites is that nonwhites
have bad credit records and low financial asset lev-
els. Bad credit can be proxied by high risk prefer-

ence, short financial planning horizons, and factors
that contribute to late payments like interrupted em-
ployment, illness, and family emergencies. Poor ed-
ucation, low skills in money management, and low
family incomes putatively contribute to bad credit
and thus the difficulty that minority individuals have
in obtaining financing in order to purchase homes.
Aggravating the negative effect of bad credit on
home ownership is the impact of low financial assets.
Lenders generally require larger down payments of
poor credit risks. Without financial assets needed to
compensate for bad credit, the combined effects of
these variables are to lower home ownership rates.
Although it is not clear how these two factors -- bad
credit and low financial assets -- influence home
equity among black homeowners, it is possible that
the net effect is to widen the racial gap in home
equity.
Ultimately, then, the question we wish to address
is how much financial factors, as opposed to demo-
graphic factors, explain racial differences in home
ownership and home equity. We know there are
wide disparities in lending that may contribute to the
inequality in home ownership. Lending practices can
also contribute to inequality in home equity if
lenders discriminate on the terms and sizes of loans.
We need to determine the extent of "unexplained"
racial residual in home ownership and home equity
that could possibly be explained by discrimination
on the part of lenders or other institutions. That is
the purpose of this article. After accounting for finan-
cial factors, such as attitudes toward risk, rates of
time discount, family resources and the like, how
much of the racial gap in home ownership and/or
home equity remains "unexplained"?
Our analysis shows that racial differences in ex-
pected home equity are explainable only to a limited
extent by racial differences in home ownership and/
or its determinants. Although there are sizable in-
come disparities that lead to lower home ownership
rates among blacks, these alone are not sufficient to
explain more than about a quarter of the gap in
expected home equity between blacks and whites.
We are left with the hypothesis that the underlying
cause of racial differences in expected home equity
rests with the behavior of lenders and creditors.
The data used to explore this question are in the
1992-1993 Wave I (ICPSR version) of the Health and
Retirement Survey (Institute for Social Research,
1993), a national probability sample of 7,608 house-
holds with persons born between 1931 and 1941. The
sampling weight is used to compensate for unequal
selection probabilities. The sample is a preretire-
ment age sample that is (or ought to be) in the last
stages of its investment cycle. Thus, one would ex-
pect housing ownership to be higher among this
group than among younger age groups and home
equity to be at a peak, if home equity is an invest-
ment vehicle designed to provide resources for re-
tirement (Vanderhart, 1993). This cohort of non-
whites, moreover, ought to be better off than
previous generations because of post-World War II
housing subsidies and government mortgage pro-
grams and post-1960s housing and mortgage antidis-
crimination legislation.
Background
Home equity is the difference between housing
value and mortgage and related debt on all housing
units owned. Persons who do not own their own
homes have no home equity (see Appendix, Note 1).
Among persons who own their own homes, home
equity varies with length of ownership, housing ap-
preciation, and related factors. These factors, in
turn, can be determined by financial and personal
variables. Conceptually, then, average home equity
can be decomposed into two parts: (1) a component
related to home ownership, and (2) a component
related to housing value less debt;
Tables 1 and 2 show the wide racial disparities in
mean and median net worth for preretirement aged
households. Mean net worth among blacks is 29.7%
that of whites. Black median net worth is only 21.2%
that of whites. When means are calculated, the ratio
of home equity to net worth is larger for blacks than
whites. But because so many blacks, even among 51-
to 61-year-olds, do not own their homes, the median
home equity for black households is very small,
resulting in a smaller proportion of blacks' median
net worth accounted for by home equity than is the
case among whites. However, even in the highest
ranks of the income distribution, where home own-
ership race differentials are small, there are consid-
erable gaps in home equity. At the top fifth of the
family income distribution, 90.8% of blacks own their
homes; 93.4% of whites do. This is not statistically
different. Yet, the mean home equity at this high end
of the distribution is $73,485 for blacks and $110,669
for whites. Thus, although the ratio of black to white
home ownership rates is 0.972 in this upper bracket,
the ratio of black to white home equity is only 0.664.
Table 3 provides summary statistics on factors that
may affect home ownership and/or home equity.
Blacks are slightly younger than whites in the sample
of householders and in the sample of homeowners.
Their family incomes are lower; they are less likely to
be married or have been married fewer years; and
they are more likely to be female and are more likely
to have children living at home. Among all house-
holds, they are less likely to work and more likely to
have health problems, although among home own-
ers, these differences are not statistically significant.
Blacks are also generally less well educated and more
likely to be concentrated in urban areas than are
whites. The regional distribution differs as well.
Blacks in the sample are found in concentrations in
South Atlantic and East North Central states, while
whites are concentrated in West North Central and
Pacific states. Both white and black Fundamentalist
Protestants make up about 12.5% of both the white
and black populations.
Several noteworthy financial factors are included
in the data set: attitudes toward risk, planning hori-
zon, and abstract thinking scores (which might serve
as a proxy for financial planning ability).

Attitudes Toward Risk. -- Respondents were
asked questions designed to gauge their attitudes
toward risk. The questions concerned two hypotheti-
cal earnings situations: one with a certain income,
another with a chance to earn a higher income,
accompanied by a risk of it being lower. The vast
majority of persons chose the income with certainty
over the various less certain income options. We
loosely term the respondents who chose the less
certain options as those with risk preferences.
The specific question was: "Suppose that you are
the only income earner in the family and you have a
good job guaranteed to give your current (family)
income every year for life. You are given the oppor-
tunity to take a new and equally good job, with a 50-
50 chance it will double your (family) income and a
50-50 chance that it will cut your (family) income by a
third. Would you take the job? Suppose the chances
were 50-50 that it would double your (family) income,
and a 50-50 chance that it would cut it in half. Would
you take the new job? Suppose the chances were 50-
50 that it would double your (family) income and 50-
50 that it would cut it by 20 percent. Would you take
the new job?" Persons answering "yes" to any of the
above were termed risk preferrers. Only 31.8% of
blacks and 35.1% of whites responded "yes" to any

of the above. Among home owners, the percentages
for blacks (32.5%) and whites (34.2%) were not statis-
tically different.
Time Horizon. -- Respondents were asked about
their financial planning periods. The interviewer
read the following: "In deciding how much of their
family income to spend or save, people are likely to
think about different financial planning periods. In
planning your (family's) savings and spending, which
of the time periods listed in the booklet is most
important to you [and your husband/wife/partner]?
1. Next few months; 2. Next year; 3. Next few years;
4. Next five to 10 years; 5. Longer than 10 years.
Persons responding with next few years, next five to
10 years, or longer than 10 years were termed as
having "long time horizons." More whites than
blacks in the survey have long time horizons. Al-
though 80.6% of whites responded that their plan-
ning horizon exceeded the next year, only 67.3% of
blacks did. A similar racial gap in planning horizon
existed even for homeowners. Although 83.2% of
white homeowners responded that their planning
horizon exceeded one year, only 73.8% of blacks did.
Both of these disparities are statistically significant.
Cognitive Skills. -- Finally, the data set includes a
proxy for cognitive skill. The specific construction of
this variable is the following. On one question focus-
ing on analogies, the interviewer asks: "In what way
are ... an orange and a banana alike . . . a table and a
chair... an eye and an ear... an egg and a seed . . .
air and water . . . a fly and a tree . . . praise and
punishment?" Scores were given in the following
manner: 0, No points; incorrect answer; don't
know, inappropriate; 1, partial credit; 2, full credit;
7, scorer not sure of score; 9, refused to answer.
Scores of 7 and 9 were collapsed to zero. Thus, the
full range of total scores was from 0 to 14. This
constituted the first part of the measure.
A second part of the measure captures memory.
The interviewer states: "Next, I'll read a list of 20
words and ask you to recall as many as you can. We
have purposely made the list long so that it will be
difficult for anyone to recall all the words -- most
people recall just a few. Please listen carefully as I
read the set of words. When I finish, I will ask you to
recall aloud as many of the words as you can, in any
order." The words on the list are lake, door, coffee,
car, mountain, steam, army, pipe, cat, forest, plant,
winter, ticket, bird, ship, city, corn, dust, cabin, iron.
After several other questions are asked, the inter-
viewer returns to this question and says: "A little
while ago, I read you a list of words and you repeated
the ones you could remember. Please tell me any of
the words you remember now." The words are now
Vol.36, No. 3,1996 353
in alphabetical order. Respondents receive one point
for each correct word remembered. The total possi-
ble score for this section is 20.
Our constructed score is the average of these two
scores. The highest possible score, therefore, is 17.
There are substantial disparities in this score be-
tween blacks and whites. The highest score for
whites was more than 30% higher than the highest
score recorded for blacks. The average score for
whites exceeded that for blacks by 50%. Among
home owners the gap is slightly smaller but remains
substantial. The average white score among home-
owners is 6.065, while the score for black homeown-
ers is 4.448. The average scores from the analogy and
memory tests for white homeowners are 6.523 and
5.606, while the scores for black homeowners are
4.540 and 4.356, respectively. Thus, more of the dif-
ference in cognitive score between blacks and
whites is due to the analogy part than the memory
portion. Even at the highest family income quintiles,
there remains a significant gap in the scores. As Table
4 reveals, although the racial gap is narrower at the
top than it is at the bottom of the income distribution
-- 19% vs 54% -- these statistically significant gaps
persist across the entire income distribution.
Together, then, these variables reveal sizable dif-
ferences in the characteristics of black and white
preretirement householders. Do these differences
"explain" the unequal home ownership probabilities
and/or the unequal home equity? We now turn to a
model designed to address that question.
A Model of Expected Home Equity
Let Pw and PB be the probabilities of home owner-
ship for whites and blacks, respectively. Let Y
TM and YB
be the home equity or the difference in home market
value and housing debt for white and black home-
owners. The expected home equity for group m,
then, is given by E(Ym) = Pm»Ym + (1 - Pm)«0, where
1
- ( 2 a,mX,m)
+ u1
and
u2
. (1)
Here, u, is assumed to have a logistic distribution and
u2
, given home ownership, is assumed to have a
normal distribution with other basic assumptions
required to the nonlinear least squares estimation.
The product of the probability of home ownership
and the home equity, given that one owns a home, is
the expected home equity.
Factors affecting home ownership and home eq-
uity are financial, demographic, and place specific.
Financial factors include attitudes toward risk, finan-
cial planning horizon, and family income. Demo-
graphic factors include marital status, age, educa-
tion, and dependents. Place-specific factors include
region of residence. Maximum likelihood and non-
linear least squares methods can be used to estimate
the coefficients in logistic and exponential equations
separately for blacks and whites (see Appendix, Note

2). Armed with these separate sets of coefficient
estimates, one can decompose the racial disparity in
expected home equity.
An Approximate Decomposition
The disparity between white and black expected
home ownership can be approximately decomposed
into portions due to unequal financial, demographic,
and place-specific factors and a component not ex-
plained by such factors. For want of a better term,
this "unexplained" portion is called the "discrimina-
tory" gap. The actual gap in expected home equity
between whites and blacks is given by:
E(YW) - E(YB) = PWYW - PBYB. (2)
Consider what the expected home equity for blacks
would be if blacks were "treated like" whites. A
"discriminatory-free" value of the expected home
equity for blacks is as follows:
E(YB) =
p8Y
B =
expffi
1 + exp-(X c
(3)
Note that the a's and |3's above are the coefficients of
the home ownership and home equity equations
estimated for white households. Then, an approxi-
mate decomposition of the gross racial difference in
expected home equity would be:
E(YW) - E(YB) = [E(YB) - E(YB)] + [E(YW) - E(YB)], (4)
where the first term in brackets is the difference in
expected home equity due to racial differences in the
coefficients determining home ownership and home
equity and the second term is the difference due to
differences in characteristics of white and black
households. The proportion of the gross difference
due to unequal coefficients, or the "discriminatory"
difference, is:
(5)
E(YB) - E(YB)
E(YW) - E(YB)
This is only an approximation, of course, because the
expected values of home equity are not linear func-
tions of the independent variables, and thus E(YW -
E(YB) is not a linear difference in expected home
equity due to differences in X's. For example, when
home ownership probabilities are identical for
blacks and whites and equal to 1, then E(YW) - E(YB) is
equal to:
exp(X &%") - exp(X PW), (6)
which does not lend itself to a simple interpretation.
However, if we divide this difference by the "dis-
crimination-free" value of expected home equity for
blacks (again for home ownership probabilities equal
to 1), then the term becomes:
W-XpWJ-i (7)
(8)
or taking the natural logarithm:
X &,WX,W - X PiWXiB = X p,w(X,w -
home equity weighted at a common set of coeffi-
cients, in this case the white coefficients. In linear
models, this difference is understood to be the por-
tion of the racial gap that is due to unequal character-
istics or endowments of blacks and whites.
For nonlinear specifications such as ours, never-
theless, the computations of "discrimination-free"
probabilities and home equities are straightforward.
The "discrimination-free" values are the values com-
puted for blacks (whites) when they face the white
(black) effects of their own endowments on out-
comes. Thus, it is possible to compute the probabil-
ity of home ownership for blacks when they are
"treated" like equally qualified whites or, for that
matter, the probability of home ownership for whites
when they are "treated" like equally qualified blacks.
The resulting estimates are termed "discrimination-
free" estimates and form the basis for our approxi-
mate decomposition.
Note, however, that we can perform six "discrimi-
nation-free" computations of expected home eq-
uity: (1) treatment of blacks like whites in the deter-
mination of home ownership and home equity; (2)
treatment of whites like blacks in the determination
of home ownership and home equity; (3) treatment
of blacks like whites in the determination of home
ownership, holding constant differences in home
equity; (4) treatment of whites like blacks in the
determination of home ownership, holding constant
differences in home equity; (5) treatment of blacks
like whites in the determination of home equity,
holding constant differences in home ownership;
and (6) treatment of whites like blacks in determina-
tion of home equity, holding constant differences in
home ownership.
Effects of Independent Factors
The previously mentioned decomposition does
not speak specifically to the independent factors that
contribute to the inequality. It is an attempt to de-
compose the total disparity into endowment and
treatment effects, but without pointing to the indi-
vidual factors that combine to yield those endow-
ment and treatment effects.
An alternative method permits the calculation of
elasticities of the racial inequality in expected home
equity. Consider the ratio of white to black expected
home equity:
R =
E(YW)
(9)
Now, of course, the term has a ready interpretation
of being the racial differences in the determinants of
This ratio, R, is the expected home equity of whites
relative to blacks. It is a measure of inequality. When
R increases, the racial inequality in expected home
equity increases. When R declines, the racial in-
equality in expected home equity declines. Taking
the natural logarithm preserves this relationship.
Thus,
ln(R) = lnE(Yw)-lnE(YB)
= ln[Pw«exp X prXiW] - ln[PB«exp X P8X(
B]
= [lnPw - lnPB] + [X ( W ] - X P?X,B]. (10)
Note that the difference in the first set of brackets
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 355
relates to home-ownership disparities and the differ-
ence in the second set of brackets relates to home
equity disparities. Thus, by breaking the inequality in
expected home equity into the sum of two parts, we
can partition the effects of independent factors on
expected home equity into portions operating
through differences in home ownership and por-
tions operating through differences in home equity.
Consider the effect of the independent factor X, on
expected home equity inequality. Whether this fac-
tor increases or decreases inequality depends on
whether ln(R) increases or decreases when Xi
changes. The derivative of ln(R) with respect to X(
is
given by:
^ L [(1 _pW)a
W_(1
_pB)ajB] +
[pW.^] (11)
dX,
mome Ownership EffectJ LHome Equity EffectJ
The first term in the brackets is the home owner-
ship effect, or the change in inequality through
changes in the relative differences in home owner-
ship. The second term in the brackets is the home
equity effect, or the change in inequality through
changes in relative differences in home equity. In
both instances the change in equality is the result of a
small change in the independent factor X,, assuming
that all other factors are held constant. These partial
changes can be computed for all independent fac-
tors. It is useful to express the result as an elasticity,
or the percentage change in the ratio of white to
black expected home equity as a result of a 1%
increase in X|. The elasticity is found to be the deriva-
tive above times X(
. Note, however, that these elastic-
ities do not factor out the effects of differences in
treatment and differences in endowments.
A Factorial Decomposition
To factor out the independent effects of each X^
one can compute the expected home equity for
blacks substituting Xiw for XjB. The result is the ex-
pected home equity for blacks if blacks were en-
dowed with Xj at the level experienced by whites.
Subtracting from this measure the expected home
equity for blacks and dividing by the racial gap in
expected home equity yields the percent of the racial
gap accounted for by racial differences in X,. Sum-
ming this result across all X, gives the total percent of
the racial gap in expected home equity that can be
accounted for by racial differences in X's. What re-
mains is the portion of the racial gap that cannot be
explained by racial differences in X's.
Results
Table 5 provides the coefficient estimates in the
home ownership and home equity equations. Sig-
nificant factors that increase the odds of home own-
ership among whites are age, marriage, number of
years married, family income, long planning hori-
zons, abstract thinking skills, and location in the East
North Central and mountain regions. Significant fac-
tors that reduce the odds of home ownership for
whites are number of marriages, health problems,
urban location, and risk preference. Significant fac-
tors that increase the odds of home ownership
among blacks are being female or married, higher
family incomes, higher scores on the abstract rea-
soning test, and living in the East North Central,
South Atlantic, East South Central, or the West South
Central regions. A few factors, significant only at the
10% level, reduce the odds of home ownership
among blacks. These include being younger and
living in urban areas.
Older, more highly educated, higher income
white homeowners married for longer periods of
time and those on the Pacific coast have higher home
equity. In contrast, white homeowners with multiple
previous marriages, who cannot work, who are Fun-
damentalist Protestants, who have longer financial
planning horizons, and who live anywhere except for
the northeast or Pacific regions have lower housing
equities.
Fewer factors are statistically significant in deter-
mining black homeowners' home equity. Significant
positive correlates are higher incomes and education
levels and living in urban areas or the Pacific region.
Significant negative variables are being unable to
work and living in the East North Central, East South
Central, or West South Central regions.
Even though the coefficients are not all statistically
significant in determining home ownership and home
equity, they differ conspicuously between blacks and
whites. Such differences suggest that not all of the gap
in home ownership or home equity arises simply from
demographic differences between blacks and whites,
as shown by decomposition.
Table 6 shows the results of the decomposition.
Using the coefficients estimated for the black and
white home equity and home ownership equations,
one can compute predicted and "discrimination-
free" probabilities of home ownership and home
equity among homeowners. These computations
permit the calculation of expected home equity un-
der various scenarios.
One scenario is when blacks and whites receive
their own estimated home equity. This base compu-
tation estimates black and white home equity, to
which other computations are compared. This calcu-
lation of expected home equity -- the product of the
predicted home equity for homeowners and the pre-
dicted home ownership probability-- is an unbiased
estimate of the actual home equity found for the
combined sample of homeowners and those who do
not own homes. This value is found in column one
and is the base from which the discriminatory gap is
measured. A second scenario is when blacks are
treated like whites or whites are treated like blacks
in the determination of home equity, holding con-
stant differences in home ownership. This is a "dis-
crimination-free" computation revealed in column
two, but it ignores possible unequal treatment in
home ownership. A third scenario is when blacks are
treated like whites or whites are treated like blacks in
the determination of home ownership, holding con-
stant differences in home equity. This also is "dis-

crimination-free" computation, but ignores possible
unequal treatment in home equity. The results are
displayed in column three. Still a fourth scenario is
when blacks are treated like whites or whites are
treated like blacks in the determination of both
home equity and home ownership. The results are
displayed in column four. These "discrimination-
free" computations can then be used to derive mea-
sures of "discriminatory gaps" due to home equity
disparities, to home ownership disparities, and to
both. These measures are displayed in columns five
through seven.
Table 6 shows that the predicted black home own-
ership rate is 59.71%. But when blacks are treated like
equally qualified whites, their home ownership rate
rises to 68.94%. Predicted home equity for black
homeowners is $48,930. When blacks are treated like
equally qualified whites, their predicted home equity
rises to $72,842. Thus, among all black families, the
expected home equity is only $29,216 (or $48,930 x
0.5971).
When black homeowners are treated like white
homeowners in the determination of home equity
but existing disparities in home ownership remain
unchanged, the expected home equity for blacks
rises to $43,494 (or $72,842 x 0.5971). Because white
expected home equity is $67,740, this means that the
discriminatory gap in home equity among homeown-
ers accounts for about 37% of the racial gap in ex-
pected home equity.
When blacks are treated like whites in the determi-
nation of home ownership but existing disparities in
home equity remain, the expected home equity for
blacks increases to $33,732 (or $48,930 x 0.6894).
Thus, holding constant existing disparities in home
equity among homeowners, discriminatory gaps in
home ownership only explain about 12% of the ob-
served gap in expected home equity.
Allowing for equal treatment of blacks and whites
in the determination of both home ownership and
home equity yields an expected home equity for
blacks of $50,217 (or $72,842 x 0.6894). This brings
the "discrimination-free" black expected home eq-
uity less the predicted black expected home equity
up to about 55% of the gap between white and black
expected home equity. The net discriminatory effect
of unequal treatment of blacks and whites in the
determination of housing ownership and home eq-
uity, then, is 55%.
The measured discriminatory effect is larger within

family income groups (see Appendix, Note 3). In the
top third of the family income distribution, the mea-
sured discriminatory gap as a percentage of the ac-
tual gap is 82%; in the middle third it is 83%; in the
lowest third it is 62%. That is, even at the highest
incomes, there remains a discriminatory portion of
the racial gap in expected home equity. Note that the
home equity component is less important at lower
incomes and the home ownership component is less
important at higher incomes.
These findings are robust with respect to the base
used to compare "equally qualified" blacks and
whites. Thus, when whites are treated like blacks,
their expected home equities fall by about 62%. More-
over, most of that fall is due to differences in home
equity and not to differences in home ownership.
Table 7 provides two sets of estimates for each
independent variable. First, the elasticity of the ex-
pected home equity inequality is presented. Column
one gives the total elasticity; column two provides
the elasticity from the home equity equation, hold-
ing constant changes in home ownership; column
three provides the elasticity from the home owner-
ship equation, holding constant changes in home
equity. The second set of estimates compute ex-
pected black home equity when black values for
each independent variable are replaced with white
values. This calculation is presented in column four.
In column five, the percentage of the total gap in
expected home equity between whites and blacks
that can be explained by each independent variable
is displayed.
The only elastic effect is that of family income. A
1% increase in the log-family income reduces the
ratio of white to black home equity by 2%. Most of
this effect is through the home ownership equation.
Only V2 of 1% of the effect is through the home
equity equation. Note, moreover, that a 1% increase
in the log of family income is a sizable increase in
untransformed income. The next largest impacts are
marital status and abstract reasoning skills. A 1%
increase in marriage or in the cognitive score will
reduce inequality in expected home equity by less
than 1%, 0.20 to 0.35%. Remembering, however, that
these elasticities are computed based on coefficients
that are not always statistically significant, the con-
clusion emerges that few if any of the independent
variables contribute substantially to explaining the
racial gap in expected home equity.
To see this point in quite another way, we estimate
the independent contribution to the gap in expected
home equity of each variable by computing what the
black expected home equity would be if blacks had
one white characteristic. For example, there is a huge
disparity in black and white cognitive scores. Sup-
pose that blacks had white scores, but all other black
characteristics remained unchanged. Computed at
the means of all independent variables, the black
expected home equity equals $33,016. When black
cognitive scores are replaced by white scores, black
expected home equity rises to $36,598. This accounts
for only about 9% of the gap between the white and
black expected home equity. Another 27% is due to
differences in log-incomes. Together, all 25 indepen-

dent factors account for at best 41.33% of the total
gap, leaving 58.67% unexplained. This figure is in the
same range as those presented in Table 6, where 55
to 62% of the gap was unexplained.
In short, although there are many factors that dif-
fer substantially between black and white house-
holders -- factors that can and do limit access to
home ownership and accumulation of equity in a
house -- none of these factors, save for family in-
come, has much of an impact on the overall inequal-
ity in home equity. Miraculously endowing blacks
with the financial, demographic, and geographic ad-
vantages enjoyed by whites would not alter the ex-
pected home equity differential to a great degree.
Instead, it appears that the unexplained or "discrimi-
natory" factors play a critical role in curtailing the
movement toward racial equality in housing.
Caveats
Our strong findings must be tempered by several
observations. First, the data set focuses on
preretirement-aged persons. These findings are diffi-
cult to extrapolate to the larger population. One
wonders, moreover, whether discriminatory pat-
terns in lending and thus in expected home equity
are smaller in earlier years but simply compound and
multiply over the life-cycle.
Second, we have not controlled for wealth or other
assets. Although doing so would require a more
complicated model specification and estimation to
account for the fact that wealth in our analysis cannot
be considered a strictly exogenous variable, it does
stand to reason that other financial assets could influ-
ence lender decisions and thus "explain" some of
the unexplained residual we have computed. One
can imagine, however, a reduced-form specification
of a model accounting for other assets that looks
exactly like the one we have specified.
Third, our measure of income is current income.
This neither measures income at the time that per-
sons obtained mortgages and purchased their homes
nor does it measure permanent income. The result is
that some portion of the "unexplained" residual may
in fact be an artifact of the measurement error in our
income proxy.
Conclusion
Ample evidence exists of substantial racial dispari-
ties in home ownership and home equity. These
disparities have the potential for preventing the
equalization of wealth and net worth in American
society. Conventional explanations for credit, finan-
cial, and housing ownership disparities seem to fo-
cus on the low incomes and poor financial skills of
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 359
minorities. Examination of a unique data set of
preretirement-aged householders provides the op-
portunity to test the hypothesis that poor financial
skills, low incomes, and/or other sociodemographic
factors are at the root of racial inequalities in hous-
ing. Others have found that financial variables seem
to be not that important in explaining disparities in
home equity (Vanderhart, 1993) and that discrimina-
tion does not emerge as the primary explanation for
racial disparities in home ownership (Megbolugbe &
Linneman, 1993). Nevertheless, other than family
income, few other variables explain much of the
racial disparity in expected home equity. The remain-
ing portion of unexplained racial gaps is large. It is
larger than that found for home ownership, where
recent estimates of discriminatory gaps are in the
range of 20 to 33%, and larger than that found for
housing prices alone, where the estimates are in the
range of 40% (Long & Caudill, 1992).
This suggests that racial differences in expected
home equity are explainable only to a limited extent
by racial differences in home ownership and/or its
determinants. Although there are sizable income
disparities that lead to lower home ownership rates
among blacks, these alone are not sufficient to ex-
plain more than about a quarter of the gaps in ex-
pected home equity between blacks and whites.
Other evidence, moreover, suggests that most of the
gap in housing prices can be explained by locational,
wealth, and income factors (Long & Caudill, 1992).
Thus, one is left with the hypothesis that the underly-
ing cause of racial differences in expected home
equity rests with lender and credit behaviors. Future
analysis of this data set will permit further explora-
tion of this hypothesis.

Appendix
The sample excludes persons with missing values for
housing value or mortgage debt.
Joint estimation of the equations seems to be more
reasonable given that the housing equity equation is
conditioned on the observed home ownership. How-
ever, Dwivedi and Srivastava (1978) suggest that sepa-
rate estimation results in equally efficient estimates if
the equations have identical explanatory variables.
There remain, of course, potential problems of sample
selection, as one anonymous referee correctly points
out. Comparisons of estimates using methods such as
Heckman's two-step estimation procedure must await
future research.
In the full sample, income explains some of the racial
differences in expected home equity. When the sample
is stratified by income, much of the income explanation
is eliminated altogether, leaving a large unexplained
residual.
