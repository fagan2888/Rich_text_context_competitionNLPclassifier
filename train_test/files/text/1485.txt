Abstract
Background: Recent studies have revealed the associations between insulin resistance (IR) and geriatric
conditions such as frailty and cognitive impairment. However, little is known about the relation of IR to
physical impairment and limitation in the aging process, eg. slow gait speed and poor muscle strength. The
aim of this study is to determine the effect of IR in performance-based physical function, specifically gait
speed and leg strength, among nondiabetic older adults.
Methods: Cross-sectional data were from the population-based National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (1999-2002). A total of 1168 nondiabetic adults ( 50 years) with nonmissing values
in fasting measures of insulin and glucose, habitual gait speed (HGS), and leg strength were analyzed. IR
was assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), whereas HGS and peak leg strength by the
20-foot timed walk test and an isokinetic dynamometer, respectively. We used multiple linear regression
to examine the association between IR and performance-based physical function.
Results: IR was inversely associated with gait speed among the men. After adjusting demographics, body
mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, chronic co-morbidities, and markers of nutrition and
cardiovascular risk, each increment of 1 standard deviation in the HOMA-IR level was associated with a
0.04 m/sec decrease (p = 0.003) in the HGS in men. We did not find such association among the women.
The IR-HGS association was not changed after further adjustment of leg strength. Last, HOMA-IR was not
demonstrated in association with peak leg strength.
Conclusion: IR is inversely associated with HGS among older men without diabetes. The results suggest
that IR, an important indicator of gait function among men, could be further investigated as an intervenable
target to prevent walking limitation.

Background
Recently, increasing research effort has been focused on
the role of IR in age-related conditions or geriatric syn-
dromes. The Italian InCHIANTI study, by examining com-
munity-dwelling elderly population, suggested that IR is
associated with cognitive impairment as evidenced by
poor performance in Trail Making Test and Mini-Mental
State Examination [1,2]. By following 3141 community-
dwelling adults for 10 years, Barzilay and colleagues from
the Cardiovascular Health Study demonstrated that IR is
associated with incident frailty [3], a composite outcome
consisting of involuntary weight loss, exhaustion, low
physical activity, slowness, and weakness. With life
expectancy reaching its historic pinnacle, decline in phys-
ical performance and the resultant late-life disability have
become common features in an aging society [4-9]. How-
ever, data examining the association between IR and phys-
ical function are relatively sparse. We hypothesized that IR
is inversely associated with physical function in commu-
nity-dwelling elders. We sought to test the hypotheses by
analyzing data from the NHANES 1999-2002.
Methods
Study Design and Population
The NHANES, a population-based survey, used a strati-
fied, multistage, and cluster sampling design to obtain a
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S.
civilian population. NHANES consists of a detailed home
interview and a health examination conducted in a
mobile examination center (MEC). Datasets, Survey
Operations Manuals, Consent Documents, and Brochures
of the NHANES 1999-2002 are available on the NHANES
website [10,11].
A subsample of 2052 participants aged 50 years and older
were randomly assigned to a morning session and had
complete information of fasting plasma glucose and
serum insulin. Individuals who had diabetes (physician-
diagnosed history, fasting plasma glucose  126 mg/dL, or
current use of diabetes medication; n = 434) or with miss-
ing values in the timed walking and isokinetic leg strength
tests because of safety concerns (recent chest or abdomi-
nal surgery; heart attack in the past 6 weeks; brain aneu-
rysm or stroke; current neck or back pain; difficulty in
bending or straightening right knee; or right knee or right
hip replacement) or any administrative, communicative,
or technical problems (n = 450) were excluded from the
analysis, leaving 1168 participants as the analytic sample.
Among the final sample, median values of C-reactive pro-
tein (0.27 mg/dL, n = 1), vitamin B12
(465.5 pg/mL, n =
2), folate (15.1 ng/mL, n = 3), total cholesterol (212 mg/
dL, n = 2), cotinine (0.05 ng/mL, n = 24), as well as body
mass index (27.12 kg/m2, n = 12) were used to impute
missing values for these variables, all of which were used
in the analysis.
Measures of IR
A blood sample was collected following an overnight fast
( 8 h) in participants who were assigned to a physical
examination during a morning session. Plasma glucose
level was measured with a hexokinase enzymatic reference
method (COBRAS MIRA; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapo-
lis, IN) and serum insulin level by a radio-immunoassay
(Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). Homeostasis
model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), an estimate of IR
commonly applied in large epidemiological studies, was
used to evaluate IR using the following formula: fasting
serum insulin (U/mL) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/
L)/22.5 [12].
Measures of habitual gait speed and isokinetic leg strength
Habitual gait speed (HGS) was measured in the MEC
according to the NHANES standardized protocol. A 20
feet long test tract area was set up in a corridor of the MEC.
The 20-foot walk was timed using a hand-held stopwatch.
The 20-foot timed walk test was performed at the partici-
pant's usual pace. Use of a walker or cane was allowed if
needed. HGS was calculated as walking distance (20 feet =
6.15 m) divided by time (second). Maximal right knee
extensor force (Newton) was measured at an angular
velocity of 60 degree/second by a Kinetic Communicator
isokinetic dynamometer (Chattecx Corp., Chattanooga,
TN).
Covariates
Age, gender, and race/ethnicity were obtained by self-
report. Co-morbidities including heart disease (defined as
a history of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease,
congestive heart failure or angina), chronic lung disease
(defined as chronic bronchitis or emphysema), and arthri-
tis were ascertained by self-report questionnaires. Alcohol
intake was determined by the questionnaire "In any one
year, have you had at least 12 drinks of any type of alcohol
beverage?" and was dichotomized. Exposure to tobacco
smoke increases the concentration of nicotine in the
blood, and nicotine is highly specific for such exposure.
Cotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine. Using their
serum cotinine concentrations (ng/mL), we classified
smoking status of participants in four groups: nonsmoker
(<14), light smoker (14-99), moderate smoker (100-199),
and heavy smoker ( 200) [13]. Three and sometimes 4
blood pressure (BP) determinations were taken using a
mercury sphygmomanometer by a NHANES physician.
BP was measured in the right arm unless specific condi-
tions prohibit the use of the right arm. Averaged systolic
and diastolic BPs were obtained. The presence of hyper-
tension was defined by a self-report doctor's diagnosis, the
use of anti-hypertensive medications, or averaged blood
pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg. Body mass index
(BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters, was categorized according to

the National Institutes of Health obesity standards: <18.5
= underweight, 18.5-24.9 = normal weight, 25.0-29.9 =
overweight, and >30 = obese [14]. C-Reactive protein
(CRP) was quantified by utilizing latex-enhanced neph-
elometry with a Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System
(Behring Diagnostics, Frankfurt, Germany). Plasma
homocysteine was measured by the Abbott homocysteine
assay (Abbott Park, IL, USA), a fully automated fluores-
cence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) method.
Analysis
Data were analyzed using Stata 9.0 (Stata, College Station,
TX) specialized for complex survey data. We used stratum
and primary sampling unit (PSU) variables required for
variance estimation. In order to account for clustering and
stratification of the multi-stage NHANES sampling
design, we incorporated appropriate sampling weight in
all analyses in order to obtain point estimates and stand-
ard errors (SEs) applicable to the U.S. population. In the
NHANES 1999-2002, separate 4-year fasting weights were
created to reflect the additional stage of sampling and the
additional nonresponse for the subsample of fasting par-
ticipants assigned to the morning session. These 4-year
fasting weights were used for data analysis.
Characteristics of the study population, including means
and SEs values for continuous variables and percentages
for categorical variables, were calculated with correction
for the survey design in both men and women. Stratified
by sex, weighted linear regression analysis was used to
examine the relation of HOMA-IR to performance-based
physical measures, namely leg strength and HGS. The dis-
tributions of HOMA-IR in both men and women were
right-skewed. Therefore, we used natural-log-transformed
values, which provided the best-fitting model for analysis
in which the HOMA-IR were treated as a continuous vari-
able. For men, standard-deviation scores of HOMA-IR
were obtained from the formula (Xi
-Xm
) ÷ SD, where Xi
was the natural-log-transformed HOMA-IR in the individ-
ual male subject, Xm
the mean natural-log-transformed
HOMA-IR in the male subjects, and SD the standard devi-
ation of the natural-log-transformed HOMA-IR in the
male subjects. The standard-deviation scores of HOMA-IR
in women were obtained from the same formula. This cal-
culation allowed us to determine the change in the gait
speed and leg strength for each increment of 1SD in the
natural-log-transformed HOMA-IR. The relations of
HOMA-IR to leg strength and gait speed were also evalu-
ated with a quartile-based analysis by dividing HOMA-IR
levels into quartiles with subjects in the lowest quartile as
the reference group. We used an extended-model
approach for covariates adjustments: Model 1 = age, race,
BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and use of
walking device; Model 2 = Model 1 + chronic diseases
(hypertension, chronic lung disease, heart diseases, and
arthritis); Model 3 = Model 2 + markers of nutrition and
cardiovascular risk (natural-log-transformed levels of
folate, vitamin B12
, total cholesterol, homocysteine and
CRP). Given the fact that muscle strength has been shown
to be an important correlate for walking speed among
community-dwelling older adults [15], we additionally
controlled for leg strength in the association between
HOMA-IR and HGS (Model 4) in order to observe possi-
ble change of association.
Results
Table 1 lists the characteristics of the participants accord-
ing to sex. The mean age among the 566 men was 61.8
years (age range 50 to 85 years), and among the 602
women it was 62.4 years (age range 50 to 85 years). The
men had higher fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin,
HOMA-IR, peak leg strength, as well as a higher preva-
lence of heart disease compared to women. The presence
of hypertension, chronic lung disease, and arthritis was
more common in women than in men. The men smoked
more than the women and consumed more alcohol. The
cut-off values for HOMA-IR quartiles among the men
were: quartile 1 (<1.80), quartile 2 (1.80-2.51), quartile 3
(2.52-3.69), and quartile 4 (>3.69); while among the
women they were quartile 1 (<1.48), quartile 2 (1.48-
2.28), quartile 3 (2.29-3.52), and quartile 4 (>3.52). Men
were comparable to women in terms of age, BMI, race,
and HGS.
HOMA-IR levels were inversely associated with HGS
among the men. After adjustment for age, race, BMI cate-
gories, alcohol consumption, and use of walking devices,
each increment of 1SD in the HOMA-IR level was associ-
ated with a 0.035 m/sec decrease (p = 0.007) in HGS
(Table 2). Additional adjustment of covariates including
chronic co-morbidities and markers of nutrition/cardio-
vascular risk (folate, vitamin B12, total cholesterol, homo-
cysteine, and CRP) did not change the association among
men (Model 2 and Model 3). In the full-adjusted model
where peak leg strength was additionally adjusted (Model
4), the negative association between HOMA-IR and HGS
among men remained ( coefficient -0.042, p = 0.001).
We did not find any association between HOMA-IR and
HGS among the women. We subsequently divided
HOMA-IR levels into quartiles and showed that HGS for
men in the highest HOMA-IR quartile were 0.066 m/sec
less than that for men in the lowest quartile after adjust-
ment for Model 1 covariates (significant trend across
HOMA-IR quartiles with p = 0.035). Likewise, supple-
mentary adjustment for additional covariates (Models 2
to Model 4) did not change the inverse association
between HOMA-IR and HGS among the men in the quar-
tile-based analyses. We did not find a clear trend between
HOMA-IR quartiles and HGS among the women. Strati-
fied by gender, adjusted means of HGS based on different

regression models (Model 4) and illustrated in the Figure
1. We did not find any association between HOMA-IR and
peak leg strength in both men and women (Data not
shown).
Discussion and conclusion
Among men without diabetes, there was an inverse asso-
ciation between IR and HGS. The relationship was inde-
pendent of age, race, BMI, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, co-morbidities, markers of nutrition and
cardiovascular risk, and peak leg strength. Our findings
support and extend previous studies examining the role of
metabolic syndrome, a cluster of cardiovascular risk fac-
tors strongly associated with IR, in predicting the develop-
ment of functional impairment. Supporting statements
from Blazer and colleagues, by analyzing 1229 older
adults from the Duke Established Populations for Epide-
miologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE), demonstrated
that metabolic syndrome independently predicted mobil-

ity decline, as assessed by the ability to perform heavy
housework unaided, walk up and down a flight of stairs
unaided, and walk half a mile unaided[16]. Additionally,
the population-based Sacramento Area Latino Study on
Aging (SALSA) reinforced the fact that metabolic syn-
drome was associated with progressive limitations in
mobility and strength by following 1606 Mexican Ameri-
cans older adults for 3 years[17]. Okoro and colleagues,
cross-sectionally examining the NHANES cohort, sug-
gested that selected components of metabolic syndrome,
specifically low HDL cholesterol and abdominal obesity,
were associated with gait impairment[18]. Nevertheless,
these studies may have weakness in internal validity
because such important confounding factors as chronic
inflammation [16-18], medical co-morbidities[16,18],
and nutritional status [16-18] were not considered. Fur-
thermore, the reports of functional impairment are self-
reported in Blazer et al[16] and Blaum et al[17], thus
imposing potential bias in outcome ascertainment.
Although metabolic syndrome, a composite outcome
defined by expert panel[19], has recently attracted
research interest, the usefulness of metabolic syndrome as
an actual pathophysiological basis of functional decline
has been questioned[20]. On the other hand, IR has been
proposed as a principal factor in initiating and perpetuat-
ing the pathologic manifestations of the metabolic syn-
drome[21]. Unfortunately, none of the above studies
scrutinize the role of IR in functional status. The cross-
sectional relation of IR to muscle strength has been
evaluated in two population-based studies of commu-
nity dwellers that highlighted an inverse association
between IR and muscle strength [22-24]. However, such
studies used different confounding variables in their
statistical models and one of the studies consisted of a
cohort entirely made up of men[22]which may explain
the discrepancies from our findings. To our knowledge,
this is the first report to describe the association between
IR and performance-based physical function among older
men and women by using a large group of geographically
dispersed and ethnically diverse national population-
based sample. Potential confounders were comprehen-
sively considered and the role of leg strength in the asso-
ciation between IR and gait speed was assessed.
By acting as a cardiovascular risk factor, IR may cause cer-
ebral atherosclerotic changes in the cerebral circulation
[25], thus contributing to the development of cerebral
micro-angiopathy (ie, leukoaraiosis or cerebral small
vessel disease). The lesions may disrupt the integrity of
frontal-subcortical circuits, thus compromising gait
function. Cerebrovascular lesions thus provide a conceiv-
able mechanism between IR and slow gait speed. Since the
association between IR and gait speed varies across gen-
der, there may be an effect modification of sex in the asso-
ciation. The fact that men had a greater baseline
prevalence of cardiovascular risk (such as heart disease
and smoking) than women may justify why an inverse
association between IR and gait speed is seen in men
but not in women. Further research efforts are needed to
investigate possible mediating factors, such as differential
coordinating processes in brain neural circuiting or sex
hormones[26], in mediating the effect of IR on gait speed.
Our results have clinical implications. IR, in addition to
its metabolic and cardiovascular implications, may serve
as an important indicator of walking function among
older man. As such, IR may be a promising target for inter-
vention to prevent decline of walking function in late life.
Secondly, pharmaceutical interventions such as met-
formin and thiazolidinedione [27], as well as additional
known strategies to effectively lower IR- healthy dietary
pattern [28], regular exercise [29], or weight reduction
[30]- may additionally improve walking function and
prevent functional decline, especially for high-risk sub-
jects.
Our study has potential limitations deserving comments.
First, due to the cross-sectional design, causal relationship
between IR and gait speed can not be established. The
association between IR and gait speed could simply be
epiphenomenon of aging and the association should be
prospectively explored. Second, although we have com-
prehensively adjusted for such confounders as chronic co-
morbidities, markers of nutrition, inflammation, and car-
diovascular risk, as well as leg strength in the association
of IR and gait speed, other important measures such as
cognitive ability, symptoms of depression, markers of
endothelial dysfunction, or evidence of cerebral small ves-
sel disease are absent or incomplete in the NHANES 1999-
2002 dataset.
In conclusion, a higher level of IR was associated with a
slower gait speed among non-diabetic older men. The
association does not exist in the women. We provided
new information for the association between IR and gait
speed among community-dwelling older adults where
data currently do not exist.
