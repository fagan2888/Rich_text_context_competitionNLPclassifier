Introduction
Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most severe types
of birth defects and affect nearly 4,000 newborns annually in
the United States (Helinski, Trauth, Jernigan, & Kerr, 2004;
Kannan, Menotti, Scherer, Dickinson, & Larson, 2007). In a
normal pregnancy, the development and closure of the neural
tube takes place within 28 days after conception. If the neural
tube does not close completely, an NTD occurs (Helinski
et al., 2004). To reduce NTDs such as anencephaly, which is
fatal to the newborn, and spina bifida, which often results in
serious health complications, the U.S. Public Health Service
recommends all women capable of becoming pregnant con-
sume 0.4 mg of folic acid per day (Prue, Hamner, & Flores,
2010). Research indicates that periconceptional (at least 1
month before conception and in early pregnancy) consump-
tion of folic acid can decrease the risk of NTDs by 50% to
72% (Helinski et al., 2004; Lindsey et al., 2009). Despite this
recommendation, a disparity in NTD-affected pregnancies
exists among different racial and ethnic groups within the
United States; prevalence rates for anencephaly in Hispanics
is 2.84 per 10,000 live births, 1.98 for non-Hispanic Whites,
and 1.80 for non-Hispanic Blacks. The prevalence of spina
bifida in Hispanics is 4.18 per 10,000 live births, 3.37 for
non-Hispanic Whites, and 2.90 for non-Hispanic Blacks
(Williams, Rasmussen, Flores, Kirby, & Edmonds, 2005).
The large-scale fortification of grains by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 has helped reduce
the occurrence of NTD (Prue et al., 2010); however, fewer
than 8% of all women reach the daily recommended level of
folic acid with fortification alone (Lindsey et al., 2009).
Multivitamin supplements are a convenient way to ensure
adequate intake of folic acid. Health promotion efforts by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
March of Dimes, and other organizations have had some suc-
cess in increasing folic acid awareness among women of
childbearing age--reporting a 17% increase in knowledge
that folic acid prevents birth defects from 1995 to 2003

Promoting Multivitamins to
Hispanic Adolescents and Mothers:
Communicating Benefits That Resonate
Michael Mackert1, Erin Donovan1, and Marie Guadagno1
Abstract
Neural tube defects (NTDs) can be reduced by 50% to 70% with sufficient periconceptional intake of folic acid. Hispanic
women are up to 3 times more likely than non-Hispanics to have a child affected by NTDs. This disparity is complicated
by health literacy, as women impacted by this disparity are also at-risk for low health literacy. The purpose of this project
was to pilot advertisements to promote multivitamins, increasing folic acid consumption, among Hispanic adolescents. The
advertisements for Hispanic adolescents and their mothers focused on broad benefits of a multivitamin, downplaying folic
acid's role in prenatal health. Participants were Hispanic mothers (n = 25) and adolescents (n = 25) at a clinic in the
Southwestern United States. Likert-type survey items and an open-ended question were used to assess attitudes toward
multivitamins and advertisements. The Newest Vital Sign (NVS) was used to assess participants' health literacy. Participants'
impressions of the ads were positive. Both groups expressed the intent to start taking a daily multivitamin after viewing the
ads--adolescents for themselves and mothers to start their daughters on a daily multivitamin. There was no relationship
between participants' health literacy and perceptions of the advertisements or intentions to begin a multivitamin habit. This
research illustrates the potential of messages that rely on peripheral health benefits to overcome communication barriers
posed by health literacy and address serious health problems such as NTDs.

(Thomas, Hauser, Rodriguez, & Quinn, 2010). However,
research measuring the effectiveness of multivitamin promo-
tion campaigns often reports limited success in such efforts,
often due to target audiences that are too narrowly or broadly
defined or culturally irrelevant messages (Flores, Prue, &
Daniel, 2007; Lawrence et al., 2003; O'Rourke & Roddy,
2007; Thomas et al., 2010). The need for effective campaigns
in this sphere remains high.
While folic acid education is vital to all women, research
has found that Hispanic women in particular are significantly
less likely than non-Hispanics to be aware of the benefits of
folic acid in reducing serious birth defects (Kannan et al.,
2007). Products made from corn masa flour, which are
dietary staples in many Hispanic communities, are also
excluded from the FDA's current mandatory grain fortifica-
tion, possibly contributing to the lack of sufficient folic acid
intake among Hispanic women (CDC, 2010). Spanish-
speaking women are reported to have lower multivitamin
usage than their English-speaking counterparts (Thomas et
al., 2010). They also have the highest rate of NTD-affected
pregnancies (Kannan et al., 2007; Prue et al., 2010). Research
establishes that a substantial disparity exists between
Hispanic and non-Hispanic women with regard to folic acid
knowledge: that it can prevent NTDs, how to consume folic
acid, the amount to consume, and when to consume it (Quinn,
Thomas, Hauser, Rodríguez, & Rodriguez-Snapp, 2009).
This serious health issue becomes more urgent due to the
fact that the Hispanic population is one of the fastest growing
in the United States and by 2020 will constitute nearly 18%
of the total population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2006). Hispanic
women generally begin to have children at a younger age and
continue to have children as they age. The short birth inter-
vals that tend to occur among Hispanic women may also lead
to further folate depletion (O'Rourke & Roddy, 2007). The
rate of unintended pregnancies is also highest among poor
Hispanic women (Prue et al., 2010). Due to their dispropor-
tionate rate of neural tube­related birth defects, their fre-
quency of births and their unintended pregnancy rates, there
remains a pressing need for effective health promotion
efforts designed to reach this vulnerable audience.
Making the problem of promoting folic acid for prenatal
care even more difficult to address is the fact that approxi-
mately 50% of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned
and that the highest rate of these unintended pregnancies
occur in women aged 18 to 24 (Lindsey et al., 2009; Thomas
et al., 2010). Due to the higher rate of unintended pregnan-
cies in younger women, research has focused on folic acid
awareness and pregnancy health efforts targeting late high
school and college-aged women (Flores & Kilker, 2007;
Lindsey et al., 2009), meaning younger audiences have not
been targeted by health promotion campaigns.
Given the health disparity among Hispanic women and
the higher rate of unplanned pregnancies in young women,
the purpose of this project was to develop and pilot test a
public health campaign that could be used to promote a
multivitamin habit (and thus increase folic acid intake)
among female Hispanic adolescents regardless of their inten-
tions to become pregnant. This overall strategy would
involve advertisements to reach the mothers of the adoles-
cents and the adolescents themselves, such that actual behav-
ior change could be driven directly (reaching adolescents)
and indirectly (through their mothers).
Background
In seeking to create new health promotion campaigns to
address the issue of NTDs, it is useful to provide background
on health literacy as context for developing new campaigns
and the Health Belief Model (HBM) as a conceptual frame-
work for thinking through what new campaigns might look
like.
Health literacy is an individual's ability to obtain, process,
and act on health information (Ad Hoc Committee on Health
Literacy, 1999). Low health literacy often leads to poorer
health outcomes due to a variety of factors, including the
individual's lack of understanding health professional's
instructions (DeWalt, Berkman, Sheridan, Lohr, & Pignone,
2004; Kalichman et al., 2000; Lindau et al., 2002; Schillinger
et al., 2002). Factors such as age, low socioeconomic status,
and being part of a minority or immigrant population can
impair health literacy (Ad Hoc Committee on Health
Literacy, 1999). Hispanic women often have many of the risk
factors associated with being low health literate, especially if
English is not their native language (Ad Hoc Committee on
Health Literacy, 1999; Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer, & Kindig,
2004). When developing health promotion efforts to address
a specific issue, such as increasing folic acid consumption
among Hispanic women, it is pertinent to understand the
needs of individuals with lower health literacy.
In addition to recognizing the information needs of low-
health-literate audiences, it is crucial to consider how indi-
viduals process health messages and take action on them.
The HBM is a theory that attempts to predict health-related
behaviors based on perceptions about a condition and the
recommended behaviors that prevent or reduce it (Janz &
Becker, 1984). According to this model, an individual's per-
ceived susceptibility to a condition and the severity of its
consequences contribute to the overall perceived threat. That
threat can lead to a correct course of action if the individual
perceives that the negative health outcome can be avoided.
The HBM suggests individuals are more likely to act on a
recommendation if they have knowledge of the negative con-
dition and/or if they are reminded by cues from media cam-
paigns, health professionals, family or friends (Janz,
Champion, & Strecher, 2002). Targeted health promotions
can influence and increase knowledge of a negative condi-
tion and also serve as cues to take preventive action, and with
its focus on perceived benefits and barriers as major con-
tributors to health behavior change, the HBM is a particu-
larly useful theoretical framework for developing new health
Mackert et al. 3
promotion campaigns. In the case of this study, the HBM
was used to design campaign materials and the instruments
used to assess their impact.
Research Questions
This investigation was guided by two primary research
questions:
Research Question 1: Can health promotion materials be
developed that successfully persuade Hispanic adoles-
cents and their mothers to start a daily multivitamin habit,
thus increasing folic acid intake?
Research Question 2: Can these materials be developed
such that health literacy does not play a role in eventual
impact on intentions to start a daily multivitamin habit?
The study used a convenience sample to investigate the
potential of the advertisements (individual messages/post-
ers) developed for this project, consistent with the key role of
message pre-testing in developing health communication
campaigns (overarching communication program) that can
then be deployed on a larger scale (National Cancer Institute,
2004).
Method
Design
Advertisements were designed to encourage multivitamin
usage among Hispanic adolescent females (ages 13-18). The
advertisements targeted the mothers of Hispanic adolescents
and the adolescents themselves to encourage multivitamin
usage. The overall strategy focused on broader benefits of
multivitamin usage, deemphasizing the specific role of folic
acid in prenatal health, to build a long-lasting multivitamin
habit that would benefit the Hispanic adolescents and pre-
pare them for a healthy pregnancy with sufficient folic acid
if and when they become pregnant--whether that pregnancy
is intended.
The advertisements were designed based on reviews of
relevant literature and existing folic acid promotion cam-
paigns, a series of classroom exercises which challenged
graduate advertising students to promote folic acid among
Hispanic females, and insights garnered through formative
research with Hispanic women (Mackert, Kahlor, Silva, &
Padilla, 2010). Specific insights from Mackert, Kahlor,
Silva, & Padilla (2010) that were utilized in the develop-
ment of these campaigns included: avoiding dense blocks
of small text that were deemed to be overwhelming by
low-health-literate participants, with resulting ads featur-
ing limited text; a preference for headlines that got partici-
pants' attention and made them want to read more, such as
through asking a question; participants did not perceive
major barriers to consuming a daily multivitamin, so ads
did not address potential barriers; a desire for a fear appeal
to raise awareness of the issue, which led to a "You Got
Lucky" headline; and a knowledge of the benefits of folic
acid among mothers that came from their first pregnancy,
which led to the overall communication strategy of target-
ing mothers already aware of the general importance of
folic acid.
Teams of advertising students then developed one adver-
tisement for Hispanic moms of adolescents (see Figure 1)
and two advertisements for Hispanic adolescents (see
Figure 2 for one ad; the other featured similar text, but a sin-
gle large photo). The ad designed for mothers was meant to
describe a range of health benefits to taking a multivitamin,
such as lowering the risk of heart disease; the ad highlighted,
but did not focus exclusively on, the value of folic acid. The
ads designed for adolescents were intended to highlight more
short-term and concrete benefits of a multivitamin, such as
boosting energy and muscle function, and it excluded any
specific information about folic acid.
As noted earlier, the HBM was used as a theoretical
framework to guide message design. The HBM was used to
frame campaign messages, highlighting perceived benefits

that would be relevant to participants and downplaying or
even omitting messages related to barriers (due to the sim-
plicity of taking a multivitamin) and severity of failure to
take a multivitamin with folic acid (because a birth affected
by NTDs would likely not be a relevant health issue to the
adolescents being targeted with this campaign). For adoles-
cents and mothers, there was an emphasis on the use of plain
language whenever possible and the use of visuals and head-
lines to catch the audience's attention and encourage them to
engage with processing campaign messages. Additional
details on the process of campaign development are provided
elsewhere (Mackert, 2012).
Measures
The study protocol was approved by the relevant Institutional
Review Board. All participants provided appropriate consent
prior to participating in the project, and they were given
US$25 gift cards to a local retailer to compensate them for
their time.
The purpose of this pilot project was to assess the poten-
tial of advertisements to promote multivitamin usage among
Hispanic adolescents as a way to increase folic acid intake.
As such, it was necessary to garner the opinions of mothers
of these adolescents and the adolescents themselves. To that
end, mothers of adolescents and adolescents were surveyed
to determine their attitudes regarding the potential benefits
of multivitamin usage, the advertisements developed for this
project, and the impact of the advertisements on their atti-
tudes and intentions to start a daily multivitamin habit.
Guided by the HBM, single-item measures were designed to
reflect specific messages about the perceived benefits of a
multivitamin that were included in each advertisement; the
advertisements for mothers and adolescents included differ-
ent messages about benefits, resulting in different survey
items for each group. Survey items are provided for mothers
(Table 1) and adolescents (Table 2) with all using a 7-point
Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly
agree).
Agraduate student administered the surveys orally in one-
on-one sessions with participants, to avoid potential issues
with participants' reading level confounding results; ads
were shown without commentary from the graduate student
collecting data. All participants also provided basic demo-
graphic information and completed the Newest Vital Sign
(NVS) to assess health literacy (Weiss et al., 2005). The NVS
is a 6-item assessment of health literacy that correlates well
with other established health literacy measures (Weiss et al.,
2005); a score of 0 to 1 on the NVS reflects a 50% or greater
chance of limited health literacy, a 2 to 3 score suggests the
possibility (25%) of limited health literacy, and a score of 4
or greater reflects adequate health literacy. Participants were
also given an opportunity to share any other thoughts they
might have after viewing the advertisements.
Analytic Strategy
Standard descriptive statistics were used to assess partici-
pants' perceptions of the advertisements developed for this
project, perceived benefits of taking multivitamins, and
intentions to start a daily multivitamin habit. Paired-samples
t tests were used to assess the impact of the study advertise-
ments on participants before and after viewing them.
Correlations were used to assess the relationship between
participants'health literacy and attitudes toward the ads, per-
ceived benefits of multivitamins, and intentions to start a
daily multivitamin habit.
Participants
Participants were recruited in the waiting room of a nonprofit
health clinic that operates in a midsize Texas city; flyers were
posted in the waiting room stating the inclusion criteria for
the study, and interested participants were directed to a grad-
uate student collecting data. The clinic serves approximately
10,000 patients per year, the majority of whom are Hispanic
(75%), female (72%), and at or below the poverty line (74%).
Participants were recruited and interviewed in English,
because campaign materials were originally developed in
Mackert et al. 5
English; in addition, the patient population at the recruitment
site features a roughly equal split between English and
Spanish as a preferred language, with the adolescent popula-
tion showing a two-to-one preference for English.
A total of 50 (N = 50) Hispanic participants were recruited
for this study, including 25 mothers (n = 25) with at least one
adolescent daughter between the ages of 13 and 18 and 25
female adolescents (n = 25) between the ages of 13 and 18;
these were individual mothers and adolescents, not dyads of
mothers with their own daughters. The mean age of the
mothers was 35.5 (SD = 8.8) with 1.8 children (SD = .9), and
the mean age of the adolescents was 14.9 (SD = 1.7). Means

Results
Mothers of Adolescents
Mothers responded to a series of statements about benefits of
and barriers to taking a multivitamin before and after view-
ing the ad encouraging mothers to start their daughters on a
multivitamin. As can be seen in Table 1, paired-samples
t tests indicated the ad increased mothers' beliefs that a mul-
tivitamin could improve appearance of hair and skin, help
prevent cancer, may help with depression, lowers risk of
heart disease, reduces risk of birth defects, can lower risk of
stroke, and can improve memory.
While the ad was not designed to eliminate the belief
that multivitamins can cause weight gain nor shift attitudes
about the expense of multivitamins, there were small (though
not statistically significant) decreases on those items. The ad
also did not significantly increase mothers' level of worry
about the health of their daughters. Results also indicate the
mothers believed the ad was useful and informative. The find-
ings also show the mothers approved of the appearance of the
ad and believed it would be effective on others like them.
The mothers expressed strong intentions to start their
daughters on a daily multivitamin (M = 6.8; SD = 0.7). While
the ad was not designed to encourage the mothers themselves
to start a daily multivitamin habit, it appears many mothers
internalized the health benefits and expressed intentions
to start taking a daily multivitamin for themselves (M = 6.5;
SD = 1.4).
A series of correlations were utilized to test the potential
relationship between the mothers' health literacy (as mea-
sured by the NVS) and their evaluation of the ad, intentions
to start their daughters on a multivitamin and intentions to
state taking a multivitamin themselves. There was no evi-
dence that health literacy was related to mothers'reactions to
the ads, which was a positive finding given the ads were
intended to be accessible and persuasive to low-health-liter-
ate audiences.
As noted earlier, participants were given a chance to share
any other thoughts they might have after viewing the adver-
tisements. Talking about what she might say to her daughter,
one mother stated: "It helps keep you healthy, smart (mem-
ory), can make her future babies healthy, acne and hair (she'd
buy into it helping her appearance)." Another participant
said, "I think she'd be willing to. I'd take them with her, say-
ing we could take them together because it would be good for
both of us." One mother expressed concern about the term
folic acid, saying, "`Acid'scares me, and I think that this acid
would be bad for me." Finally, several participants com-
mented on the colors of the advertisement, suggesting
brighter colors might be better.
Adolescents
Adolescents were asked to respond to a series of statements
about benefits of and barriers to taking a multivitamin before
and after viewing the ads. As can be seen in Table 2, paired-
samples t tests indicated the ad increased adolescents'beliefs
that a multivitamin could help improve appearance of hair,
skin, and nails, as well as boost energy.
The ads did not achieve significant improvements in ado-
lescents'beliefs that a multivitamin could help build stronger
bones, be helpful even if someone has a healthy diet, or is a
good way to stay healthy. The ads were not designed to
address the mistaken belief that a multivitamin can contrib-
ute to weight gain, nor that a multivitamin every day can be
expensive, and the ads did not significantly shift beliefs
about these items. They also were not designed to rely on a
fear appeal to motivate behavior change, so the lack of a sig-
nificant shift in adolescents' perceptions of their health was
as intended.
Adolescents' views of the ads themselves--that they
included useful information, were easy to understand, looked
good, and would be liked by people like them--were not as
positive as the ad designed for mothers. Given this, the ads
did lead to relatively strong intentions for the adolescents to
start taking a multivitamin every day (M = 5.7; SD = 1.4).
As with the mothers, these ads were designed to be acces-
sible and persuasive to low-health-literate audiences.Aseries
of correlations found no significant relationship between the
adolescents' health literacy (as measured by the NVS) and
their perceptions of the ads or their intentions to start taking
a multivitamin every day.
Adolescent participants were also asked to share any
thoughts they had after viewing the advertisements. Discussing
what she might say to her mom about a multivitamin, one par-
ticipant said, "I want to take a multivitamin to keep myself
healthy, strong, and energetic." Another reported, "This has
actually made me really want to buy and take them." Concerns
about taste of multivitamins emerged as a potential barrier,
however: "I don't like the taste of them."
Discussion
Given the importance of promoting folic acid to reduce the
incidence of NTDs in general, and the disparity impacting
Hispanics in particular, it is crucial to continue to explore
new health promotion strategies for increasing folic acid
intake. The advertisements developed for this project were
designed to increase multivitamin consumption--and thus
folic acid intake--among Hispanic adolescents by promot-
ing the benefits of multivitamins to the mothers of adoles-
cents and the adolescents themselves. Such a strategy,
focused on broader benefits of a daily multivitamin habit,
could help prepare these adolescents for a healthy preg-
nancy--whenever that might happen--whether that preg-
nancy is planned or unplanned.
Mackert et al. 7
Overall, the response to the advertisements was positive,
with mothers having a more favorable impression of the ads
and the content than the adolescents. The advertisements
were successful in shifting beliefs about the benefits of con-
suming multivitamins, leading to intentions to start taking a
multivitamin; intentions were stronger for mothers (for start-
ing their daughters and themselves on a daily multivitamin)
than for the adolescents themselves. The stronger reaction of
the mothers may be due to the inclusion of relatively novel
information (e.g., the potential of a multivitamin to help pre-
vent cancer) in the advertisement targeting mothers, leading
to stronger intentions. Previous research demonstrates that
new or surprising information increases the likelihood that
audiences will attend to messages (O'Keefe, 2002).
It is important to note there was no relationship between
participants' health literacy and their perceptions of the
advertisements or stated intentions regarding initiating a
daily multivitamin habit. These advertisements were
designed to be accessible and persuasive to low-health-liter-
ate audiences, so the lack of a relationship between health
literacy and intentions is an encouraging finding. Thus, it
demonstrates the potential of a health promotion model
designed to utilize education and persuasion--finding bene-
fits that will be most persuasive to engage the target audience
and change health behavior regardless of an individual's
health literacy. In this case, the campaign was designed to
reduce the focus on folic acid as a way to have a healthy
pregnancy, which is likely an important step in addressing
this problem for pregnancies which are not planned.
Before considering implications for future research and
practice, it is important to recognize the limitations of this
research. Most significantly, participants expressed their
intentions to start their daughters (for mothers) or themselves
(for adolescents) on a daily multivitamin; while intentions
are a strong predictor of actual behavior (Ajzen, 1991), this
pilot work did not track participants' actual behavior over
time. This study was conducted in English, so the potential
of this approach to engage and promote behavior change
Hispanics who do not speak English cannot be established;
study results suggest translation to Spanish and further test-
ing is warranted. Finally, this research was conducted with
participants drawn from a single clinic in Texas, which may
limit generalizability to other populations.
Even with these limitations, this work points to interest-
ing directions for future research. A first important direction
is to investigate the potential gap between stated intentions
and actual behavior. Continued investigation of this cam-
paign would require a longitudinal assessment of the short-
term and long-term impacts of the campaign on participants'
actual behavior. Another likely outcome of this campaign is
interpersonal conversation between a mother and daughter,
as the mother explains to her daughter why she should take a
multivitamin or the daughter explains to her mom why she
would like to start taking a multivitamin. Future research
could investigate those conversations and which are more or
less likely to contribute to the daughter eventually starting to
take a multivitamin and maintaining that habit. While this
project relied on the HBM to guide the investigation, the
Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1991) could be a
useful theoretical framework for considering the role of
social norms around a health behavior such as a daily multi-
vitamin. In addition, these advertisements did not address
any barriers to starting a multivitamin habit, largely due to
formative research and the fact that messages about barriers
did not fit the layout and theme of these advertisements;
future research, utilizing different messages or layouts, might
incorporate details about perceived barriers (e.g., concerns
about the term folic acid or taste of a multivitamin) and eval-
uate the impact of these messages on recipients'intentions to
start a daily multivitamin habit.
This campaign was designed to reach Hispanic adoles-
cents and their mothers, but the targeting of these campaigns
was generally subtle (e.g., the name of the girl in the ad
shown in Figure 2). Future research should assess how indi-
viduals of different ethnicities respond to these advertise-
ments. Particularly, given the budget constraints under which
public health campaigns must operate, a targeted campaign
that can remain persuasive to broader audiences while
appealing to Hispanic populations would be valuable. Such a
strategy could address not just a disparity (in this case, the
disparity in NTDs impacting Hispanics) but a pressing, pop-
ulation-wide problem (the continued incidence of NTDs in
the general population in the face of public health efforts to
eliminate this health concern).
Apractical challenge in promoting folic acid (alone or as one
benefit of taking a multivitamin) is how to reach people with
that message. Future research must focus on the most effective
placements for posters and other media, preferably places where
the target audience spends time more frequently than doctor's
offices--one example might be grocery stores (Mackert,
Kahlor, Silva, & Padilla, 2010) While this pilot research estab-
lished the potential of these advertisements, it is a necessity to
demonstrate the "real-world" impact on multivitamin consump-
tion as part of a large-scale social marketing campaign.
Addressing the problems of NTDs, in general and the dis-
parity impacting Hispanics, remains a pressing public health
issue. While existing health promotion efforts have begun to
address the problem, there remains a need to develop new
and alternative strategies to increase folic acid intake. This
research demonstrates the potential efficacy of encouraging
a multivitamin habit among Hispanic adolescents and their
moms--a strategy that relies on the fact that other health
benefits of a multivitamin might be more salient than mes-
sages focusing on prenatal health and that particular benefit
of folic acid. Public health researchers and practitioners must
continue to explore the potential of campaigns that rely on

peripheral health benefits of a recommended health behavior
to address health problems where education or engagement
on the "main" health issue can be difficult to achieve.
More broadly, issues associated with health literacy per-
meate the health care system, resulting in poorer health out-
comes for low-health-literate populations. Addressing those
problems will involve building individuals' health literacy,
educating health care providers to better care for low-health-
literate patients, and making changes to the health care sys-
tem itself. This research serves as evidence of the utility of
public health messages relying on persuasion and potentially
peripheral health messages to improve health promotion to
low-health-literate audiences. The specific context of this
study was prenatal health promotion, but these findings can
be extended to other pressing health issues.
