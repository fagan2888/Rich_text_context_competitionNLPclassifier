Abstract
Objectives. Estimate the prevalence and healthcare
costs of undiagnosed opioid abuse among com-
mercially insured individuals.
Study Design. Retrospective analysis of de-identified
pharmacy and medical claims data and publicly-
available survey data (no IRB approval required).
Methods. This study focused on commercially
insured individuals. Rates of prescription pain-
reliever abuse/dependence ("abuse") among indi-
viduals ages 12 were calculated using National
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) public-use
data for 2006­2011 and assumed to capture both
diagnosed and undiagnosed opioid abuse. Rates of
undiagnosed opioid abuse were calculated as the
difference between NSDUH rates and published
rates of diagnosed opioid abuse. OptumHealth
Reporting and Insights claims data were used to
estimate the healthcare costs of undiagnosed
abuse. Diagnosed abusers ages 12­64 were identi-
fied using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for opioid
abuse/dependence. Pre-diagnosis costs were
assumed to be a proxy for undiagnosed opioid
abuse costs. The ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed
abuse costs was calculated as the ratio of annual
per-patient healthcare costs between pre-diagnosis
and post-diagnosis periods.
Results. While rates of diagnosed opioid abuse
among commercially insured individuals increased
from 0.07% in 2006 to 0.19% in 2011, rates of
undiagnosed abuse decreased from 0.42% to 0.38%
over the same time period. Annual per-patient
healthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers were
69.2% of those of diagnosed abusers.
Conclusions. Per-patient healthcare costs of
undiagnosed abusers among the commercially
insured are estimated to be lower than those of
diagnosed abusers. However, the higher prevalence
of undiagnosed opioid abuse implies that undiag-
nosed abuse represents a substantial burden to
commercial payers.

Introduction
The abuse of prescription opioids is a major public
health problem in the United States. The 2012 National
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reported that
an estimated 2.1 million Americans ages 12 or older
had prescription pain-reliever abuse or dependence
("abuse") [1]. Opioid abuse imposes substantial costs
on payers and society. Rice et al. estimated excess
1325

Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
annual per-patient healthcare costs of diagnosed opioid
abuse of $10,627 among commercially insured patients
[2]. A similar study by Rice et al. used a larger commer-
cial claims database and reported consistent results,
with excess annual per-patient healthcare costs of diag-
nosed opioid abuse of $11,376 [3]. At the societal level,
Birnbaum et al. estimated that the total costs of pre-
scription opioid abuse, including direct costs and indi-
rect costs, were $55.7 billion in 2007 [4].
A persistent challenge, however, is that a substantial
share of opioid abuse is not formally diagnosed [5].
Despite a growing body of evidence regarding the pub-
lic health and economic burden of diagnosed opioid
abuse, little is known about the burden imposed by
undiagnosed opioid abuse. Stigma associated with
opioid abuse and its treatment [6] may hinder the diag-
nosis and treatment of opioid abuse. In addition, opioid
abuse is likely to be underreported in administrative
claims databases for several reasons, including poor
awareness, reluctance to put a potentially damaging
diagnosis in the patient's record, and reimbursement
considerations [7]. Recent literature has estimated that
undiagnosed abusers outnumber diagnosed abusers,
with ratios ranging from 5:1 to approximately 3:1 [2,8].
These ratios represent preliminary estimates based on
assumptions and the best-available data at the time.
However, they did not account for differences in rates of
diagnosed and undiagnosed abuse across payers,
which affect the calculations. There have been no stud-
ies published to date that have empirically estimated the
costs of undiagnosed abuse. In the absence of these
results, prior research has relied on expert opinion that
the costs of undiagnosed abuse are 80% of those of
diagnosed abuse [5]. The objective of this study was to
improve on the existing literature to more precisely esti-
mate the prevalence and costs of undiagnosed opioid
abuse among commercially insured individuals.
Methods
Data Sources
To estimate the rates of undiagnosed opioid abuse
among commercially insured individuals, we used a
combination of NSDUH [9] data on prescription pain-
reliever abuse and published literature on rates of diag-
nosed opioid abuse. The NSDUH is an annual survey of
approximately 67,500 persons sponsored by the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra-
tion (SAMHSA). It is the primary source of information
on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco in the
civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United
States aged 12 years old or older.
NSDUH respondents were classified as having prescrip-
tion pain reliever abuse or dependence if they
responded positively to several criteria based on the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
4th edition (DSM-IV) (see further details in the NSDUH
Recoded Substance Dependence and Abuse Variable
Documentation Appendix). The NSDUH also included
questions about respondents' general health insurance
coverage. For this study, we limited our analysis to
patients reporting coverage by private insurance
(excluding patients who also reported either Medicare or
Medicaid coverage).
Rates of diagnosed opioid abuse among commercially
insured individuals were obtained from Rice et al.
(2014), which used the OptumHealth Reporting and
Insights ("OptumHealth") medical and pharmacy claims
database [2]. This same database was used to estimate
the costs of undiagnosed opioid abuse in the present
study. The OptumHealth database includes commer-
cially insured beneficiaries (employees, spouses, chil-
dren, and retirees) of 60 large self-insured companies
with locations across the United States and representing
a variety of industries and job types. The data include
de-identified medical claims (date of service, diagnoses
received, procedures performed, place of service, and
payment amounts), pharmacy claims (fill dates, national
drug codes, and payment amounts), and eligibility infor-
mation (patient demographics and enrollment history).
Prevalence of Undiagnosed Abuse
Overall prevalence rates of abuse were estimated annu-
ally as the proportion of commercially insured individuals
classified as having opioid abuse or dependence among
all commercially insured individuals in a year in the
NSDUH public-use data from 2006 to 2011. Final sample
weights for the public-use file were used for this analysis.
Importantly, we considered these estimates to reflect the
total commercially insured population with opioid abuse
or dependence in the United States, both diagnosed and
undiagnosed. To verify that the subset of patients
included in the public-use data were representative of the
broader set of respondents included in the full restricted-
use data, we compared our calculated rates of abuse to
the reported rates of abuse published in annual reports of
the NSDUH from 2006 to 2011 [10­15].
Prevalence rates of diagnosed abuse reported by Rice
et al. [2] were assumed to represent the rates of diag-
nosed abuse among all commercially insured individuals
in the United States. For details regarding the study,
including sample selection and the definition of abuse,
see Rice et al. [2].
For each year from 2006 to 2011, the difference
between the overall rate of abuse calculated using the
NSDUH data and the rate of diagnosed abuse reported
by Rice et al. [2] represented the rate of undiagnosed
opioid abuse. The ratio of undiagnosed abuse to diag-
nosed abuse was calculated as the rate of undiagnosed
abuse divided by the rate of diagnosed abuse.
Healthcare Costs of Undiagnosed Abuse
Patients with at least one medical claim linked to an
ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for opioid abuse/dependence
Kirson et al.
1326
("abuse") were identified in the OptumHealth database
(304.03, 304.73, 305.53, 965.00, 965.02, 965.09).
The combination of diagnosis codes for both abuse and
dependence is consistent with recent literature
[4,5,8,16­19], as well as the new classification adopted
by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, 5th edition (DSM-5) [20]. Hereinafter we refer to
"opioid abuse" for simplicity.
Because the objective of the analysis was to assess
recent trends in abuse, patients were required to have
their first diagnosis for opioid abuse/dependence during
Q1 2006­Q1 2012. Patients were required to be ages
12­64 and to have continuous non-HMO coverage
throughout a 24-month study period to ensure that all
relevant drug and medical claims were captured for the
final sample of patients. The "diagnosis date" was
defined as the date of the first medical claim with an
opioid abuse/dependence diagnosis. The 24-month
study period consisted of a 12-month period prior to
the diagnosis date and a 12-month period following the
diagnosis date (see Figure 1). Patients ages 65 and
older were excluded from our study, as their Medicare
eligibility may limit the ability to observe all relevant drug
and medical claims.
Because no prior studies have examined the healthcare
costs of undiagnosed opioid abuse, this study devel-
oped a new approach to estimating the healthcare
costs of undiagnosed opioid abuse. Based on the rec-
ognition that that there is some period in advance of the
actual abuse diagnosis during which the patient is abus-
ing opioids, it was assumed that the pre-diagnosis
healthcare costs of diagnosed opioid abusers could be
used as a proxy for the healthcare costs of undiagnosed
opioid abusers. Specifically, we calculated the mean
per-patient healthcare costs across all patients diag-
nosed with opioid abuse during a 12-month period cen-
tered on the diagnosis date (see Figure 1). These
healthcare costs represented the mean annual per-
patient healthcare costs of diagnosed abusers. The
inclusion of healthcare costs during the 6-month pre-
diagnosis period was intended to reflect the fact that
the burden of abuse is usually present well before a cri-
sis event requiring medical care (and resulting in a for-
mal diagnosis of abuse). This approach is consistent
with prior literature [2,8,17]. We also calculated the
mean per-patient 6-month pre-diagnosis period health-
care costs of abusers, and these costs were annualized
as a proxy for the mean per-patient healthcare costs of
abusers who remain undiagnosed for a 12-month
period. In essence, for undiagnosed abusers, we
assumed that the pre-diagnosis healthcare costs would
persist on an annual basis, as undiagnosed abusers
likely avoid the type of crisis event that would lead to a
formal diagnosis. The ratio of the mean annual per-
patient healthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers to
diagnosed abusers was then calculated.
As a sensitivity analysis, we explored an alternative defi-
nition of pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis periods using
non-overlapping time periods. We calculated the mean
annual per-patient healthcare costs across all patients
diagnosed with opioid abuse during a 12-month period
prior to the diagnosis date and used these costs as a
proxy for the mean annual per-patient healthcare costs
of undiagnosed abusers. The mean per-patient health-
care costs during a 12-month period following the diag-
nosis date represented the mean annual per-patient
healthcare costs of diagnosed abusers. The ratio of the
mean annual per-patient healthcare costs for these two
time periods was then calculated.
Healthcare costs were calculated as the total amount
paid to the provider by the insurer for all covered serv-
ices, regardless of diagnosis. Out-of-pocket payments
by patients (e.g., copays, deductibles) were excluded.
Healthcare costs were inflated to 2012 U.S. dollars
using the medical care component of the Consumer
Price Index. All analyses were conducted using SAS
software for Windows version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC).
Results
Prevalence of Undiagnosed Abuse
From 2006 to 2011, the rate of prescription pain-
reliever abuse reported by NSDUH (irrespective of
health insurance coverage) was 0.7%, except for 2010
when the rate was 0.8% (see Table 1). Our estimated
rates, calculated using the subset of respondents
included in the public-use data, matched the reported
figures within rounding error (see Table 1). Rates of
prescription pain-reliever abuse estimated using the
public-use data stayed relatively stable from 2006 to
2011, with a slight increase from 0.66% in 2006 to
0.72% in 2011. For commercially insured individuals,
rates of prescription pain-reliever abuse also experi-
enced a slight increase from 2006 (0.49%) to 2011
(0.56%) (see Table 2). As noted above, this rate was
assumed to include both diagnosed and undiagnosed
abuse.
Figure 1 Study period.
The Burden of Undiagnosed Opioid Abuse
1327
In terms of rates of diagnosed abuse, Rice et al.
reported a trend of increasing rates of diagnosed abuse
from 2006 to 2011 [2]. Rates of diagnosed opioid abuse
grew each year from 2006 (0.07%) and to 2011 (0.19%)
(see Table 2).
For each year, the difference between the NSDUH rate
and the Rice et al. (2014) rate represented the rate of
undiagnosed abuse among commercially insured indi-
viduals. For example, in 2006, the difference between
the NSDUH estimate of 0.49% and the Rice et al.
(2014) estimate of 0.07% was 0.42% (see Table 2, Fig-
ure 2). The rate of undiagnosed opioid abuse decreased
from 0.42% in 2006 to 0.38% in 2011.
With a rate of undiagnosed opioid abuse of 0.38% and
a rate of diagnosed opioid abuse of 0.19% among com-
mercially insured individuals in 2011, the ratio of undiag-
nosed to diagnosed opioid abuse was 2:1 for 2011 (see
Table 2). This ratio steadily decreased from 6.3:1 in
2006.
Healthcare Costs of Undiagnosed Abuse
3,928 diagnosed opioid abusers met the inclusion crite-
ria. The mean annual per-patient healthcare costs of
diagnosed abusers were $19,931 in the 12-month
period centered on the diagnosis date (see Figure 3). In
the 6-month pre-diagnosis period, the mean 6-month
per-patient healthcare costs of diagnosed abusers were
$6,900. These costs, when annualized, totaled $13,799
(due to rounding), which we use as a proxy for the
mean per-patient healthcare costs of abusers who
remain undiagnosed for a 12-month period. The ratio of
the mean annual per-patient healthcare costs of undiag-
nosed abusers to diagnosed abusers was 69.2%.
In the sensitivity analysis, the mean per-patient health-
care costs were $10,407 in the 12-month pre-diagnosis
period and $19,723 in the 12-month post-diagnosis
period, yielding a ratio of mean annual per-patient
healthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers to diagnosed
abusers of 52.8%.
Discussion
From 2006 to 2011, overall rates of opioid abuse
increased by 16% (0.49% to 0.56%) among the com-
mercially insured. During this same time period, rates of
diagnosed opioid abuse nearly tripled (0.07% to 0.19%),
resulting in a slight decline in the rates of undiagnosed
opioid abuse. The ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed
abuse declined from over 6:1 in 2006 to 2:1 in 2011.
These findings suggest increased awareness and diag-
nosis of opioid abuse among commercially insured indi-
viduals, although they continue to imply that
undiagnosed opioid abuse is substantial.
Although not the focus of this current study, it is also
important to mention the growing problem of heroin
abuse in recent years [21]. Additional research is neces-
sary to examine the impact of recent efforts to address
prescription opioid abuse (e.g., introduction of prescrip-
tion opioids with abuse-deterrent properties, state-level
prescription drug monitoring programs) on heroin
abuse.
More recent NSDUH data suggest that the overall rate
of prescription pain-reliever abuse at the national level
(irrespective of health insurance coverage) increased to
0.8% in 2012 [1] then decreased to 0.7% in 2013 [22].

of prescription pain-reliever abuse at the national level

followed a similar pattern, increasing to 0.60% in 2012
then decreasing to 0.48% in 2013 (data on file). While
the rates of diagnosed opioid abuse among commer-
cially insured individuals reported in Rice et al. [2] and
used in this study were not available beyond 2011, a
recent study found a similar trend of increasing rates of
diagnosed opioid abuse among commercially insured
individuals continuing into 2012 [3].
The ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed abuse (2:1 in
2011) differs from previously-reported ratios of 5:1 from
Rossiter et al. [8] and 3.3:1 in Rice et al. [2]. There
could be several reasons for these differences. The
Rossiter et al. ratio was derived from an earlier study [5]
that analyzed data from 1999 to 2005. As noted above,
the ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed abuse has
declined considerably over time. The Rice et al. study

utilized data from 2011, but assumed that rates of
abuse were identical across payers, including Medicare
and Medicaid. However, preliminary analysis of NSDUH
data suggest important differences in overall rates of
abuse (diagnosed and undiagnosed) across payers. For
example, in 2011, the overall rate of opioid abuse was
0.6% for commercially insured individuals, 0.2% for
Medicare beneficiaries, 1.4% for Medicaid beneficiaries,
0.9% for individuals with other forms of health insurance
coverage (e.g., VA, TRICARE), and 1.2% for the unin-
sured (results available on request). By focusing the
analysis of NSDUH data on commercially insured indi-
viduals, our estimates of the rates of undiagnosed
opioid abuse among the commercially insured are likely
more accurate than previous estimates.
In terms of the costs of undiagnosed opioid abuse, we
estimated that the ratio of the mean annual per-patient
healthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers to diagnosed
abusers was 69.2%. This new approach has several
strengths. The period over which the healthcare costs of
diagnosed opioid abusers were calculated was defined in
an identical way to previously-published studies on the
healthcare costs of opioid abuse [2,8,23]. Because this
approach used a time period that is consistent with the
Rice et al. (2014) study, we can apply the ratio of the
mean annual per-patient healthcare costs of undiag-
nosed abusers to diagnosed abusers to the excess
annual per-patient healthcare costs of diagnosed opioid
abuse of $10,627 among commercially insured individu-
als from Rice et al. [2]. This yields an estimate of excess
annual per-patient healthcare costs of undiagnosed
opioid abuse of $7,354 among commercially insured
patients. Note that while the previously published papers
reported the burden of diagnosed opioid abuse in terms
of excess costs of abusers over matched (non-abuser)
controls, to account for potential confounding factors, the
present study calculated the cost ratio of undiagnosed to
diagnosed abuse using absolute dollar terms. As the
present study implemented a pre-post methodology in
which the costs of the same diagnosed abusers were
compared at two different points in time, absolute costs
were an appropriate metric as fixed unobserved con-
founders were eliminated in the calculation.
This approach assumed that the annualized mean per-
patient 6-month pre-diagnosis period healthcare costs
of abusers can be used as a proxy for abusers who
remain undiagnosed for a 12-month period. In actuality,
however, the healthcare costs of undiagnosed opioid
abusers may continue to increase after the initial 6-
month period, as suggested by the increase in health-
care costs from the 6-3 month pre-diagnosis period to
the 3-0 month pre-diagnosis period (see Figure 3). If
this were true, this approach would be an underesti-
mate of the costs of undiagnosed abuse.
The sensitivity analysis did not use overlapping periods
to define the pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis periods,
creating complete separation between the time periods
used to estimate the diagnosed and undiagnosed cost
of abuse. Further, there was no need for annualization.
The 12-month post-diagnosis period was used to calcu-
late the healthcare costs of diagnosed opioid abuse.
However, the 12-month post-diagnosis period did not
account for the fact that diagnosed abusers may incur
substantial healthcare costs in the 6-month period lead-
ing up to a formal diagnosis of abuse, which are impor-
tant to include in calculating the healthcare costs
associated with diagnosed opioid abuse. In fact, there
is evidence of rising healthcare costs even before the
first diagnosis of opioid abuse (see Figure 3). In addition,
because the sensitivity analysis used a time period that
is not consistent with the previous literature, we cannot
apply the estimated ratios to prior estimates of the
excess healthcare costs of diagnosed opioid abuse. For
these reasons, the core analysis described above is the
recommended approach for estimating the costs of
undiagnosed abuse.
While the healthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers are
estimated to be 69.2% of the healthcare costs of diag-
nosed abusers, the higher prevalence of undiagnosed
abuse implies that undiagnosed abuse represents sub-
stantial costs to commercial payers. Many payers may
be unaware of the substantial burden of opioid abuse
[24], perhaps due to underdiagnosis of the condition.
Limitations
In addition to the aforementioned limitations specific to
our core analysis and the sensitivity analysis for estimat-
ing the healthcare costs of undiagnosed opioid abuse,
this study has several general limitations. By definition,
undiagnosed abusers are unobservable in claims data
as they do not receive any of the ICD-9-CM diagnosis
codes for abuse. Therefore, we rely on the assumption
that estimates of prescription pain-reliever abuse calcu-
lated using the NSDUH public-use data capture all diag-
nosed and undiagnosed abuse among Americans aged
12 and above.
This study does not examine potential reasons for differ-
ences in medical costs between undiagnosed abusers
and diagnosed abusers. The claims data used in this
study do not lend themselves to decomposing the costs
of undiagnosed abusers as we are unable to identify
actual undiagnosed abusers (and have to rely on diag-
nosed abusers pre-diagnosis as a proxy for undiagnosed
abusers). Future research should examine other types of
data (e.g., surveys, medical records) to better understand
the costs (and characteristics) of undiagnosed abusers.
In addition, this study does not specifically examine
whether there have been any shifts in treatment that
would affect the medical costs of abuse. We conducted
a targeted literature search and did not find evidence of
changes in the treatment of opioid abuse that would
affect medical costs. However, it is possible that there
have been changes over time in the way abuse is diag-
nosed and treated. It is also possible that new technolo-
gies may have affected the costs of abuse. Recent
Kirson et al.
1330
research has found that the introduction of reformulated
extended-release oxycodone with abuse-deterrent prop-
erties was associated with reductions in rates of diag-
nosed abuse among chronic users of extended-release
opioids [8]. Future research should examine whether
prescription opioids with abuse-deterrent properties
have affected the costs of abuse.
Finally, this study focuses on commercially insured indi-
viduals. Future research should examine the burden of
undiagnosed abuse among individuals with Medicaid,
Medicare, and other health insurance coverage. As
mentioned above, rates of diagnosed and undiagnosed
abuse may differ for these individuals, as may the
healthcare costs.
Conclusions
While the healthcare costs of undiagnosed abusers are
lower than those of diagnosed abusers, the higher prev-
alence of undiagnosed opioid abuse implies that
undiagnosed opioid abuse represents a substantial bur-
den to commercial payers. For every commercially
insured individual diagnosed with opioid abuse in 2011,
we estimated two additional commercially insured indi-
viduals who were undiagnosed. The decline in rates of
undiagnosed abuse from 2006 to 2011, together with
the increase in rates of diagnosed abuse, suggests
increased awareness and diagnosis of opioid abuse
among commercially insured individuals.
