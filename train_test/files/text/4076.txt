Introduction
Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR)Theme as a Core Concept
The role of corporations in social activities seems tremendously
increasing; indeed, in some cases, such participations exceed
the extent to which governments are able to undertake. As
an illustration, the measures that ICT giants in collaboration
with humanitarian organizations--such as NetHope--have
taken in Haiti earthquake (Greenhill, 2010) or more recently
have done in Pakistan flood (Brindley, 2010) are tokens of
the actions which exceed the common capabilities of gov-
ernments. However, social expectations from corporations
have risen considerably, as several studies have demonstrated
this fact--such as the evidences provided by Matten and Moon
(2004) or McKinsey (Bielak, Bonini, & Oppenheim, 2007).
In terms of social problems, corporations can act reac-
tively, like what happens in the times of natural disasters;
however, for an active or proactive approach, it is crucial to
determine the adequate societal issues on which a company
should define CSR programs or apply CSR initiatives. This
concept, corporate social initiative (CSI), is defined by
Kotler and Lee (2005) as, "Corporate social initiatives are
major activities undertaken by a corporation to support social
causes and to fulfill commitments to corporate social respon-
sibility" (p. 3). The concept CSR Theme or CSR Issue has
emerged as the core subject based on which a CSR program
is defined. These expressions have been frequently used but
apparently always as a general concept. For a better clarifica-
tion, here we define "CSR theme/issue" as a subject that
could be practiced by corporations to resolve a part of prob-
lems a society is susceptible to or could be addressed through
discourse, argument, or thought about how corporations can
participate in resolving such problems.
In our terms, every social problem would be deemed as a
CSR theme only when it has been addressed by a corpora-
tion. That is, if a certain societal issue is out of the influence
of corporations, it cannot be a CSR theme. Different organi-
zations have different levels of influence over their operating
environment due to the dispersal of the factors; a CSR theme
is therefore a relative and contingent concept. Figure 1
depicts a model for this idea.
The sphere of influence varies among different corpora-
tions. An issue that looks irremediable to a small company
might somehow fall inside the influence realms of a large
corporation. Of course it could be on a debate whether a

Iranian Corporations and Corporate
Social Responsibility:An Overview to
Adoption of CSRThemes
Hadi Chapardar1 and Raveed Khanlari1
Abstract
Comparative studies have demonstrated that the themes for corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives are different
among nations and geographic regions based on their cultural, political, legal, social, and economic contexts. In this research,
which was conducted on 56 corporations from IMI100 (100 Iranian companies with highest annual sales, ranked by Industrial
Management Institute or IMI),CSR themes in priority have been identified.Data collected from a semistructured questionnaire
and some complementary interviews were analyzed against the results of a reference study over 100 companies from
developed countries.The resulted themes, some of which may have several subthemes, were developed in three economic,
environmental, and social categories. Beside these qualitative findings, two indices are constructed for indicating the
"importance" of and "contribution" to each theme. The results and discussions are supposed to help business leaders,
international companies inside Iran, governmental authorities, and researchers to improve CSR discussions and practices in
the country where CSR undergoes a less structured platform.

social problem falls inside the influence sphere of a corpora-
tion or not. For a certain context, a variety of societal issues
could be assumed as the contextual CSR themes' base,
although the borders of such a base might be sometimes
vague, with loose interpretation.
"Contextuality" of CSR
It has been long argued that every corporation in a specific
country is under the influence of a prevailing institutional
framework that has been formed during history--Whitley
(1997), for instance, named it National Business System.
CSR, therefore, is a contextual arena as some researchers
have demonstrated. To mention a few studies, Matten and
Moon (2004) have discussed on the relationship between
CSR and national contexts; Crane and Matten (2004) have
described a sheer interest in comparative CSR studies; con-
tingency of CSR in national contexts has been argued by
Habisch, Janker, and Wegner (2005); and Gjølberg (2009)
attempted to develop an index comparing national CSR prac-
tices. Beside the increasing trend of these contextual and
comparative CSR studies, constraints such as the limited
number of countries or regions included in the scope of
research always inhibit academia and businesses from devel-
oping a general depiction of CSR practices.
Furthermore,studies suchas thatofMcKinsey&Company
(2007) demonstrated that business strategists in different
parts of the world tend to concentrate on a wide range of soci-
etal issues. The themes that have been recognized or experi-
enced in a specific region cannot be directly prescribed to the
other regions. Such questions may immediately come to the
mind of an individual: What societal issues shall be in focus
in my country and which of them have been previously con-
sidered as CSR themes? Moreover, what analogies and anom-
alies can be found between these CSR themes and those of
other nations or regions? Such questions have been addressed
in an exploratory­descriptive research in Iran and a main
part of its results is being discussed here.
Some Studies on CSR
Themes:A Quick Glance
A number of studies have been conducted on social themes
with a variety in scope, goals, respondents, methodology,
and validity.
Maignan and Ralston (2002) performed a comparative
study between the United States and three European countries--
the United Kingdom, France, and Netherlands. With 50 large
companies sampled from each country according to sales
revenue, this study is a website content analysis research.
Maignan and Ralston's study is based on previous compara-
tive studies such as that of Langlois and Schlegelmich (1990)
and Bennett (1998). Developing the categorization of CSR
by Danna Wood (1991), Maignan and Ralston organized
their findings in three separate groups: motivating principles,
CSR processes, and stakeholder driven. In terms of CSR
themes, the third group includes a few different issues related
to the stakeholders who receive the main advantage of each
of the issues. Because of the purpose of this study, just a
limited number of CSR themes have been identified in it.
Silberhorn and Warren (2007) developed Maignan and
Ralston's (2002) framework in a comparative study between
20 German and 20 British companies sampled through their
turnover rankings. This study expanded the themes and
showed results such as increasing "quality of life" topics in
both countries and put more attention to "arts and culture"
group in German corporations.
Beside such attempts, a more developed categorization
was defined in 2004 by Athens University of Economics
and Business in a project named CSR Quest. CSR Quest
provides a well-rounded classification of themes in three
"influence areas": workplace, marketplace, and environ-
ment and society (CSR Quest, 2010). Each theme is then
classified into subthemes and they in turn could be devel-
oped further to sub-sub-themes. This elaborate classifica-
tion, we believe, is among the best taxonomies; yet its
significant coverage is apparently used in no empirical
research. Consequently, for the purpose of our research
which includes identification of themes and measurement
of how much each of them has been practiced, this classi-
fication was not applicable because there are no numeric
data available for comparison.
Anumber of researches have also been conducted by profes-
sional institutions such as BSR, a nonprofit organization which
works with its global network to develop sustainable business
strategies and solutions. In its research, BSR identifies seven
prioritized themes (BSR, 2009). Other instances of studies by
similar bodies include two categorizations of themes by CSR
Asia (Huen, 2008, and CSR Asia, 2009), and a research on
themes in Indian companies with highest sales that was done in
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India
(ASSOCHAM; Ahmad, 2009). Such researches conducted by
professional institutions, in fact, have unknown validity because

their methodologies have not been described or evaluated.
However, other professional researches, such as a global survey
undertaken by McKinsey & Company (2007) to assess the
impact of societal issues on business, provide some valuable
information in this field.
Finally, Ferguson and Popescu (2006) have conducted a
research on 100 best corporate citizens from 16 countries
categorized in five distinct geographical groups. These coun-
tries include the United States, the United Kingdom,Australia,
Canada, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and
Switzerland. In a part of their study, these two professors of
public relations found that the companies had practiced more
than 100 different types of CSR and sustainability programs,
represented in three broad categories of (a) economic, (b)
environmental, and (c) social initiatives. Although their
study employed content analysis to survey the websites of
the companies, which is different from our methodology, we
consider it as a basis for our study because of its relatively
good coverage of the themes, its statistics for our compara-
tive purpose, and its adequate scientific validity. We call this
taxonomy reference categorization and take it as a basis for
our study.
Method and Research Process
Based on its purposes,1 this research deploys a hybridized
approach: A combination of qualitative and quantitative
methods to identify the CSR themes and measure the prior-
ity of each theme, and also the extent to which the Industrial
Management Institute 100 (IMI100) companies2 have con-
tributed toward each of them. Both parts have been fulfilled
collectively through a semistructured questionnaire and some
complementary interviews.
The research population primarily includes 100 top--in
terms of annual sales--Iranian companies, each of which
works in a specific industry. However, it was predictable that
it would never be possible to collect data from all these top
companies. Conducting this type of research in large corpo-
rations faces many obstacles (Wolff, 2004)--perhaps that is
why website contents have been vastly used as the source
of data in similar studies. In case of Iran, the obstacles seem
more preventive because of the factors such as extreme
bureaucratic atmosphere of large corporations, reluctance to
share information with others, and scant attention to research
activities. Nonetheless, 56 companies took part in the research
and this was more than the expectation. In all, 52% of these
companies belonged to private sector--government has been
always dominant in Iranian business environment.
Case sampling was the next step. To determine the impor-
tance and priority of CSR themes, every single respondent
from each corporation had to have a strategic position.Asenior
or C-level manager who is best related to CSR activities might
be considered as the best. Still, in many of the surveyed com-
panies, no specific department solely held the responsibilities
around CSR. Whereas some corporations had established spe-
cific units to implement CSR-related measures such as those
related to ISO 14000 standards and EFQM Excellence Model,
in other companies CSR activities were distributed among dif-
ferent departments. Discovering the right respondent in each
corporation was a major challenge. In all, 39% of the respon-
dents were CEOs or other C-level managers, while 54% were
middle managers relevant to CSR, and the 7% remained
belonging to the lower levels. And regarding the level of the
respondents' education, 57% of them held a PhD or a master's
degree.
Data Gathering and Analysis
Based on the previous experiences in Iran, the best way to
convince corporations to contribute to a research is personal
networks through which the accomplishment of the task
would tremendously be facilitated.
The main research tool was a semistructured questionnaire
(appendix) that included both open-ended and closed
questions--to identify the most important societal issues and
to quantify the contribution of the firm to each issue, respec-
tively.Aflexible combination of different methods was applied
to collect valid data. An initial telephone or face-to-face con-
versation provided the required information and background
for contribution of the respondents. Still, the completed
open-ended questions in many cases were not precise enough
to be coded and categorized to form a specific taxonomy of
socioenvironmental issues; hence, further telephone conver-
sations were crucial.
Obviously, the degree to which companies had taken part
in such CSR programs was not subjected to a close scrutiny
and therefore the researchers tried not to let the desirability
of the subject influence the validity of the results.
Raw data were transferred to a database designed for this
purpose. Each of the socioenvironmental issues had to be
mapped onto one category--or sometimes more--in the "ref-
erence categorization." Predictably, part of these data could not
be mapped onto the reference categorization. These contextual
issues had to be placed in new appropriate themes and sub-
themes in one of the major triple groups. The final categori-
zation of the Iranian themes which was named developed
categorization is presented inTable 1 and will be described later.
The researchers repeated this "coding" process 3 times
separately while they checked and discussed about each
other's results. This led to a better categorization; however,
because of the conceptual nature of such taxonomies, this
could be as always debated. For instance, plenty of respon-
dents had mentioned different issues around transportation,
traffic, and movement. Transportation on its own can be
classified based on different dimensions such as mode (air,
rail, etc.) and function (passenger or freight). Such classifi-
cations, however, cannot be directly applied in this research
as it would not be an appropriate approach to bring all the
raw data under the same umbrella.

Developing the Indices
Using descriptive statistics, we then developed and used two
indices to score the CSR themes captured through the ques-
tionnaires and interviews. The first index, "importance,"
focuses on the significance assumed for each theme; whereas
the second index, "contribution," demonstrates the degree to
which corporations entered on each theme in their CSR pro-
grams. The importance index for each issue is calculated
based on the number of references the respondents held as
important as to be addressed within the society. That is, for
each specific theme, number of times it was mentioned to
the total number of mentioning of all themes in its group was
considered as its indicator of importance:
This index can be similarly calculated for the sub-
themes in a specific theme as well as the whole three
groups. Contribution index, however, is calculated based
on the number of the companies which implemented at
least one CSR program in a distinct group, theme, or sub-
theme:

The contribution index is structured based on the number of
companies to make it relatively comparable with the results
of the reference research.
These two indices, together, provide adequate data to
reach to an appropriate understanding of how different themes
have been considered and practiced in companies. Although
some themes look important, they might not have been prac-
ticed adequately by companies and this will reveal a "CSR
gap" between the needs and the practices.
Results and Discussion
Contextual Issues
Data gathered from the Iranian companies are organized in
three main groups as to be comparable with the results of
the reference categorization. Each group contains several
themes and probably subthemes, many of which are new to
the reference categorization. Table 1 represents the devel-
oped categorization.
In each group, it was necessary to add new themes to
include the contextual findings such as "unemployment" in
economic group, "promotional programs for environment"
in environmental group, and "social values and behavioral
issues" in social group. Most of these added contextual
themes that were not present in the reference categorization
belong to the social group. These new themes may have new
6 SAGE Open
subthemes as well. Similarly, based on our findings, some
existent themes also required adding one or more new sub-
themes to broaden the realm of its concept according to the
data gathered. For instance, in environmental group, respon-
dents mentioned issues related to other kinds of pollution
like noise or wave pollution. Albeit, some of these important
added themes might have primarily been identified in the
reference study too and Ferguson and Popescu (2006) should
have classified them into one of several "other" categories
for their scant magnitude. To sum up, whereas in reference
categorization, Ferguson and Popescu have classified their
findings in 21 themes and 20 subthemes, in our developed
categorization 31 themes and 47 subthemes have been listed,
as shown in Table 1.
With regard to the previous discussion about the social
problems and CSR issues, in this research 10 social issues
are identified as non-CSR theme since no Iranian company
had a CSR initiative for them. This includes five issues
from the reference categorization and five identified social
problems from the Iranian context. That is, five issues of
the reference categorization were not mentioned by any
Iranian executive at all. These include "programs prohibit-
ing business in countries with human rights violations";
"environmental management programs beyond compli-
ance"; "environmental research, generally"; "antiracism/big-
otry"; and "genetics/testing." These were excluded from
the developed categorization as they found no application
by the Iranian companies.
In addition, the other five issues were reportedly impor-
tant social problems that were out of the sphere of influence
of the researched companies. These five were considered as
"social problems" and were removed from the list of CSR
themes as no company had an initiative to address them:
"prostitution," "totalitarianism," "interference of local people
in corporate affairs," "corruption," and "social inequalities."
Importance and Contribution in Groups
According to the analyzed data, most of the themes that
executives have mentioned as "important" for the society
fall in the environmental group with a 47% rate of inclusion,
while social group stands next with 42%. Only 11% of the
themes executives deemed important belong to economic
group.
For contribution index, similarly, 87.5% of the Iranian
companies have adopted at least one program for environ-
mental issues, while their contributions to social and eco-
nomic groups are less. Environmental regulations in the
country underlie this meaningful attention of the companies:
In the absence of real social monitoring institutions, such as
consumer-related nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),
the companies are more inclined toward environmental pro-
grams for which legislations and awards are somewhat pres-
ent. More or less, governmental institutions inspect some
dimensions of environmental protection, and certificates such
as ISO 14000 are known in the society and can increase a
company's reputation.
If we cautiously compare the results with the reference
study, we find these results not so far from the international
companies. Caveat is that for some differences in method-
ology exact comparison between the percentages is not
recommended.
EconomicThemes
Socioeconomic themes in studied companies were found
tremendously different from that of reference study.
Unemployment solely possessed 61% of importance for all
economic themes, which is a token for this pressing problem
in Iran, especially if we note that this theme was not addressed
by companies from developed countries in the reference
study. That might come by the explanation that despite the
privatization program that Iran's government has followed
during the last two decades, Iran's economy is still govern-
mentally centralized. In addition, international economic
sanctions against Iran have worsened the condition by far;
hence, job creation and real employment has been tragically
affected during recent years.
In terms of contribution, 34% of companies claimed to
have participation in this field. "Inflation/low income com-
pared with life costs" acquired the second position in both
indices. This theme has not been addressed in the reference
categorization, too. Table 1 shows that Iranian executives
have further worrisome thoughts on society's economic prob-
lems than their counterparts in developed countries. That
might be considered as a natural outcome of being on the
path of development.

(2006).

EnvironmentalThemes
"Air/water/hazardous waste pollution" and its subthemes
stand prominently on the top of important environmental
issues of Iran with 74% of referrals over all the mentioned
themes. Similarly, 84% of the studied companies announced
that they have made contribution toward this major problem.
A cautious comparison with reference findings is interesting.
Increase of diseases, especially cancer, in the recent years
might have been the root of such a worry for access to clean
air and water among the Iranian managers.
Other themes such as "preservation" and "environmental
education" have been practiced less than international com-
panies. This could be interpreted as a rather reactive behav-
ior than preventive approach. That is, in themes such as
"environmental education" which are preventive measures
for a better future, Iranian companies have worked less than
their international counterparts.
SocialThemes
The most substantial difference was observed in social group
where 6 themes and 22 subthemes were substituted with the
relatively minor-scaled categories of "others" in the refer-
ence study.
As shown in Figure 4, a considerable value is present for
"traffic and transportation" over the importance index, over-
whelmingly far off the figures expected. It is one of the
significant anomalies of CSR themes in Iranian context and
international context, as in the reference categorization, this
theme is absolutely absent.
This finding seems natural; in fact, Tehran and other big
cities are burdened with dense population, adding up the dif-
ficulty of moving people inside the cities. Finding a place to
park your car in downtown of Tehran may take more than
1 hr, in crude terms. In addition, poor public transportation
leaves people with no option but to drive their own cars.
Annual death toll by car accidents stands higher than 24,000
(JahanNews, 2009). Commercial transportation infrastruc-
ture is also poor. All these cramming factors bring on "traffic
and transportation" to be a major issue. This theme grasped a
high 30% share of all important social themes mentioned,
specific to Iran's big cities, with a growing population in
urban regions. However, as depicted in Figure 5, only 36%
of Iranian companies planned programs for it; this can hence
be considered as a CSR gap--this crucial issue stands in the

fourth place of contribution. Shockingly, "car accidents"
were neither ranked at the top rows in the importance index
nor in the contribution. "Parking lots," though appear to be a
pragmatic theme for CSR projects, has been given a share of
not more than 6% of the companies surveyed.
The findings for "community program sponsorships"
placed Iran not at a high level of the reference study's results
when roughly and cautiously comparing the figures (Figure 6).
It should be considered that countries from reference study
are all indexed with top figures at Organisation for Economic
Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Social Indicators
(OECD, 2009), whereas Iran could not reserve a better place
than in the Medium Human Development table (United
Nations Development Programme, 2010). As shown in
Figure 6, Iranian companies did not get a better share of
51.79%, which is at the minimum threshold of the developed
countries' contribution, and this shows a big gap for corpo-
rate practices over this important issue. Themes like "crime/
safety" and "antipoverty" seem not only important to the
well-being of a society but also grasp the opportunity for
risk-avoiding expansion of the businesses over that commu-
nity, and the contribution of the corporations surveyed were
reportedly at low level.
Combining the data from the reference study with this
research in Figure 6, the contribution of different geographi-
cal contexts toward "community programs sponsorship" can
be compared. Sponsoring the community programs among
American and western European companies is higher than
their counterparts in Japan and Nordic countries as well as
Iranian companies. In search for the roots, based on the dis-
cussions made by researchers such as Matten and Moon
(2004) and Gjølberg (2009), basic disparities in national sys-
tems and institutions underlies such contextual differences. In
comparison with social systems governing Nordic countries,
American companies find more necessity to sponsor public
programs. However, it is shocking that in spite of enormous
social needs in Iran, only about half of Iranian executives
have considered this CSR theme important. Subthemes such
as "employee volunteerism" seem new to Iranian companies
and the company executives have less sponsored or supported
community programs and voluntary works.
Another interesting result in this part is over the subthemes
that are not mentioned as "important" by any of the respon-
dents but have a noticeable share of participation. "Religious
causes/programs support," for instance, is a topic for which
many corporations, especially large ones, define year-round
programs. In summary, "community programs" is suggested
as an essential subject for further researches in the context of
Iran's regime and nation's institutional structure. It is interest-
ing why a common and long-established way of practicing
CSR is not finding its path to the business environment of
Iran with its old tradition of philanthropic activities.
Many in Iran believe that contributing toward construc-
tion of the schools has been a long tradition; especially in
deprived regions. Plenty of NGOs with such a mission have
been always working in the country and it is said that about
100,000 philanthropist are active in this field (EcoNews,
2009). Surprisingly, this fact does not find a path to the
Figure 6. Contribution to "community programs sponsorships" in comparison

corporate contributions in comparison with other countries
(Figure 8). As Matten and Moon (2004) have discussed, the
scant contribution of corporations in Nordic countries is not
strange as governmental institutions are efficiently playing
their roles in this field. In Iranian context, it seems that a
combination of philanthropic measures by individuals and

the development of semigovernmental and private higher
education institutes have relieved the problem. This happens
regardless to the fact that collaboration between academia
and industries is not well defined: Design of the courses is
not in compliance with the corporations' needs.
Another social topic that draws attention is "philanthropic
contributions" where a divide between Iranian and interna-
tional contributions is observed. This old type of CSR practic-
ing remains at a very low percentage while even other Persian
Gulf countries have apparently undergone this practice in
expanding their programs to a broader range of stakeholders
(Ronnegard, 2009). That holds the hypothesis that indus-
tries' relationships with NGOs operating in Iran are not
firmly established and businessmen are not conferring ideas
with these institutions for a tighter cooperation.
"Disaster/crisis/terrorism," surprisingly, has been
remained out of the managers' sight. Iran, being reported by
Maplecroft (2010) has reported Iran at the third place vul-
nerable to natural disasters. Hence, beside the absolute
necessity for public policies regarding preventative and cor-
rective actions for disasters, serious corporate involvement
is required over this issue. CSR, here, would receive a
stricter investigation if it gains attention as an effective tool
for progressing programs.
Near 10% of all social issues were categorized in "social
values and behavioral issues"--an important complicated
theme for a society in a long transition path from traditional-
ism to modernism.
Conclusion
The results of this study are not definitely intended to extend
to any population other than the 56 studied companies; the
researchers, however, try to deploy their general understand-
ing of the Iranian context to show how different, or similar,
CSR is perceived by the players of business environment in
Iran--a country which is mainly out of international researches
about CSR.
In addition, interpretation of such data might seem disput-
able, for CSR has never been adequately addressed in Iranian
business and academic environment as a structured field or
system. In spite of elaborate philanthropic traditions of
entrepreneurs, CSR as a "structured knowledge" is still rela-
tively new to Iran's business atmosphere. This study, yet,
shows that in the absence of a strong CSR platform, Iranian
surveyed companies are not strangers to the CSR practices
although they are unlinked to the international knowledge-
generating events and bodies that occur and act around this
still-to-rationalize concept.
General Implications for Business community
As shown in Table 1 and other information provided, anoma-
lies and analogies can be observed between Iranian themes
and internationally addressed ones. The results of this study
can help business communities in several ways. First, busi-
ness leaders may find a number of CSR themes for their par-
ticipations which they might have not thought about yet.
Second, these leaders can also focus their CSR practices on
more important issues, especially those for which there is a
"CSR gap" between "importance" and "contribution."
Besides, those Trans-National Corporations or Multi-National
Enterprises (TNC/MNEs) which are active in Iran and obey
their world
wide CSR plans may also find these analogies and
anomalies useful for undergoing their global measures in
compliance with contextual circumstances.
The significant differences between the CSR themes in
Iranian companies and those of International ones confirm
the agreed argument that CSR is a contextual subject. Themes
such as "programs prohibiting business in countries with
human rights violations" which have been addressed in inter-
national companies seem extremely faraway from Iranian
business atmosphere in which international collaborations are
limited and concepts such as TNC/MNEs, foreign markets,
and globalization are not so common. Similarly, interna-
tionally practiced themes such as "antiracism/bigotry" and
"genetics/testing" were not mentioned or practiced by Iranian
business executives because in Iranian society, racism cannot
be assumed as a serious social problem; similarly, subjects
such as genetics are mostly addressed by governmental insti-
tutions in a limited scale; hence, neither is there a public
awareness about the issue nor do these fall in the influence
sphere of the companies. If one considers the isolation of
Iranian business in global business atmosphere in terms of
sanctions and other political reasons, the issues that have not
been practiced would become more meaningful.
On the contrary, through the surveyed Iranian corpora-
tions, dozens of themes and subthemes were found that were
new to the reference study. Albeit, some of these added
themes have been found through other studies in countries
with similar contexts, such as in India where "women entre-
preneurship" is an important CSR theme (Ahmad, 2009).
In economic group, though researchers have tried to con-
trol the respondents not to be slanted toward less-social-and-
more-economic issues, several themes were added to the
reference categorization. The noticeable economic concerns
of the executives seem natural if we consider serious eco-
nomic problems in Iranian business climate in terms of
employment, privatization, economic growth, and ease of
doing business, especially during the recent years.
Pollution as a main concern surfaced in the environmental
group--an old problem for which never a real treatment had
been undergone in the country. Themes such as "noise pollu-
tion" and "wave pollution" have been distinctly added to the
reference themes and this reflects Iranian executives' con-
cerns for escalation of different types of pollution. While
noise pollution has been oppressing residents of large cities
for decades, cell phone station antennas and satellite TV sig-
nal jam for political purposes are new subjects of informal
or even formal speculations.3 Mismanagement of natural
resources is also a constant subject for a profound disputation
by environmental activists and NGOs--two actors who are
12 SAGE Open
conceived of as intruders by authorities and sometimes
acknowledged to deserve punitive actions.4
The prominent number of social themes added to the
reference categorization can also be interpreted as a clue
to various societal issues that Iran is involved in. Identified
CSR themes are generally accepted as main societal issues,
such as drug abuse. Having an overall view on the issues to
which Iranian companies have more contribution, one can
find it interesting that majority of the actions are corrective/
reactive measures; preventive measures like cultural initia-
tives are less addressed by corporations. Furthermore, in
some cases, reactive programs such as disaster relief
programs should be bettered. With such a high risk for
earthquake, a noticeable gap was observed between the
importance of and contribution to natural disasters among
the companies.
To sum up, anomalies should be interpreted just with con-
sideration of contextual circumstances. As an illustration, no
respondent mentioned programs for music--maybe because
of some religious restrictions which have been imposed on
this art after the Islamic revolution in 1979. In contrast, "reli-
gious causes/programs support" have been addressed as an
ongoing practice while respondents made no mention of it in
terms of importance. It is wonderful that business executives
strive for such a subject although they do not perceive it as
an important subject.
Implications for Government and Researchers
Governmental institutions can also find the results of this
research applicable if they intend to revise the rules and regu-
lations to stimulate societal activities of business units in a
more result-oriented platform. This, of course, needs further
researches on specific subjects to reach to more generalizable
results.
Beside the CSR themes, five "social problems" were
identified for which no company had a program to address.
These, therefore, are not considered as "CSR themes." This
reveals a meaningful conclusion on the influence sphere of
the companies. Wide borders of problems such as "prostitu-
tion," "totalitarianism," "interference of local people in cor-
porate affairs," "corruption," and "social inequalities" seem
out of reach of the companies and are mostly assumed as
government responsibility. Moreover, based on the religious
roots of the Iranian government, problems such as prostitu-
tion have always been dismissed and ignored by the authori-
ties who announce that there is no prostitution in Islamic
Iran. Such taboos are barely found not troublesome as a CSR
theme for companies. Furthermore, problems such as "totali-
tarianism" directly refer to a sociopolitical attitude which
points the governance of the country. Regardless of how a
company's executive have dared to mention such a problem
in this research, and considering the overall political climate
of the country, one may find it natural why such issues fall
out of the scope of CSR initiatives adopted by companies.
This can be an interesting subject for further studies--how
does the governance system of a country affects the CSR
themes addressed by companies?
Such differences in themes can be a clue to the necessity of
establishment of a more general taxonomy for CSR themes.
Attempts such as the one performed in Athens University of
Economics and Business (CSR Quest, 2010) should be hailed;
yet, this taxonomy lacks availability of experimental data.
Many researchers still deploy their own system of categoriza-
tion; hence, it is tough to use their results in other researches.
Maybe it is a responsibility of international CSR institutions
to develop a general taxonomy.
And last but not least, studies on CSR themes and programs
in many cases have been concentrated on what corporations
have addressed. Parallel studies to explore which CSR themes
are deemed significant by other stakeholders, such as consumers
and social experts, can actually deepen the view to the subject.
Appendix
Questionnaire
Hereby we thank you in advance for the time you put to fill
in this questionnaire.
The following questionnaire is designed to fulfill the pur-
pose of a research from Industrial Management Institute
(IMI) in Tehran that measures how and to what level the
companies listed in IMI100 have contributed to the social
activities.
The exigencies of corporate contributions to social activ-
ities and environmental initiatives have been much debated
as a controversial issue during the current and for the last
decades; to some experts' viewpoint, corporations should
regard all the stakeholders' benefit equally (no matter it is a
shareholder, customer, employee, supplier, community,
government, or is from the other categories), so that social
problems--like illiteracy; human rights abuse or public
health low practices, beside the environmental damages;
degradation; and destruction--will all inevitably be inte-
grated into the procedure of product and process design of
the company's core business activities, or, at least, into its
side works. Conversely, some other thinkers believe that
corporations should be worried about society's well-being
only by solidly concentrating on business and accruing ben-
efits (that will finally lead to an increased number of
employments) rather than directly contributing to social
problems which make them off the business road, their pri-
mary responsibility.
In this research, we are looking forward a more robust
recognition of viewpoints of the managers from IMI top 100
Iranian companies and of their planned, or projected, pro-
grams in this area. We would like to thank you once again in
advance for the genuine responses and truthful information
that you provide us through this questionnaire; we assure
you that all this info will be kept confidential and they will
be used only for analysis and assessment, or in an aggregation
format, without mentioning any company's name directly.

Notes
1. This study was conducted to grasp an overall cognition about
corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions of Iranian
14 SAGE Open
large companies. This article does not include the entire finding
of the research.
2. Industrial Management Institute (IMI) is a main Iranian body
for training, consulting, and research in management. Based
on their financial reports, this institution determined top Ira-
nian large companies in terms of annual sale. This yearly list
is known as IMI100. At the time this research was being con-
ducted, the latest published IMI100 list was the 2008 edition
which was based on financial reports of 2007.
3. Many evidences and arguments are available for these issues.
Seepage of sewage nitrate to drinking water, installation of cell
phone antennas absolutely close to the homes, damaging satel-
lite jam to destroy TV signals of opposition channels, and vapor-
ization of gasoline 20 times as much as the standard level are a
few of the topics in the press.
4. As an illustration, while many believe--and statistics confirm--
that nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are not adequately
addressed in Iran, some authorities have claimed that NGOs must
be under stiffer governmental controls (Shahr News, 2010).
