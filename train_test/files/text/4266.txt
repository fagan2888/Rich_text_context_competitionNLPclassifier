Abstract. We report an experiment designed to investigate the effect of modifying the sound of
high-heeled shoes on women's self-reported valence, arousal, and dominance scores, as well as
any changes to a variety of measures of bodily sensation. We also assessed whether self-evaluated
personality traits and the enjoyment associated with wearing heels were correlated with these effects.
Forty-eight women walked down a "virtual runway" while listening to four interaction sounds (leather-
and polypropylene-soled high-heeled shoes contacting ceramic flooring or carpet). Analysis of the
questionnaires that the participants completed indicated that the type of sonic interaction impacted
valence, arousal, and dominance scores, as well as the evaluated bodily sensations. There were
also correlations between these scores and both self-evaluated personality traits and the reported
enjoyment associated with wearing high heels. These results demonstrate the effect that the sound
of a woman's physical interaction with the environment can have, especially when her contact with
the ground while walking makes a louder sound. More generally, these results demonstrate that the
manipulation of product extrinsic sounds can modify people's evaluation of their emotional outcomes
(valence, arousal, and dominance), as well as their bodily sensations.
Keywords: multisensory perception, auditory perception, sonic interaction, user experience, consumer behaviour.
1 Introduction
Interest in the study of multisensory perception has grown dramatically over the last decade or so (see
Bremner, Lewkowicz, & Spence, 2012; Calvert, Spence, & Stein, 2004; Stein, 2012, for reviews).
One particularly fascinating area of research interest involves the study of those interactions between
touch/haptics and audition (see Gallace & Spence, 2014, for a review)--in particular, looking at how
the sounds resulting from our interaction with the objects and surfaces in the environment influence
our perception of the feel and qualities of those items (e.g., Byron, 2012; Spence & Zampini, 2006).
Tajadura-Jiménez et al. (2012) have, for instance, demonstrated that changing the auditory feed-
back that a person hears when tapping a table can give rise to the impression that their arm is signifi-
cantly longer than it actually is. Meanwhile, Senna, Maravita, Bolognini, and Parise (2014) recently
built on earlier studies of "the parchment skin illusion" (Guest, Catmur, Lloyd, & Spence, 2002;
Jousmäki & Hari, 1998) to show that if the nature of the sound that participants heard synchronized
with the tapping on their own arm was changed, they reported that their arm felt like it had turned
to marble. Hence, while people typically give little consideration to the sounds that result from their
interaction with the environment, a growing body of empirical research now shows that action-related
sounds do indeed provide a rich source of information that influences our multisensory perception of
a variety of product attributes. This would appear to be true no matter whether people realize it or not
(e.g., Byron, 2012; Spence & Zampini, 2006; Zampini, Guest, & Spence, 2003).
Aglioti and Pazzaglia (2010) have highlighted the fact that actions are connected to sounds, since
the actions of others can be represented auditorily. So, for instance, Ro, Hsu, Yasar, Elmore, and
Beauchamp (2009) reported on a series of experiments designed to investigate the influence of audi-
tory cues on somatosensory perception. Their research demonstrated that people's tactile perception

responses and bodily sensations

could be profoundly influenced by auditory cues, thus suggesting that similar coding mechanisms are
likely to underlie information processing in the two modalities.
Meanwhile, Wilson, Reed, and Braida (2009, 2010) have also demonstrated near-threshold level
auditory and tactile tonal stimuli when presented simultaneously in objective detection contexts, rein-
forcing the existence of interaction between auditory and tactile perceptions. Similar findings have
also been reported by Yau, Olenczak, Dammann, and Bensmaia (2009). The latter researchers dem-
onstrated that audition could interfere with tactile frequency perception. Thus, auditory and tactile
frequency channels appear to be fundamentally linked.
In recent years, designers have started to become interested in trying to influence the experience
of the consumer by means of product sound interactions (e.g., Quinn, 2012). Focusing on the semantic
attributes of product sounds, Özcan and van Egmond (2012) were able to identify eight factors that
underlie people's semantic associations with product sounds: Attention, roughness, smoothness, tem-
poral constancy, familiarity/unfamiliarity, unpleasantness, machinery, and power. Perceptual factors
(attention, roughness, smoothness, and temporal constancy) were found to be correlated with cognitive
factors (power, machinery, and familiarity/unfamiliarity) and with more emotional factors (unpleas-
antness). Product sounds evoke meaningful associations; they can also exert a profound influence over
a consumer's ultimate product experience.
It can therefore be argued that sound should be considered as an integral part of the multisensory
experience for many products categories. In the field of product design, Schifferstein and Hekkert
(2008) have stated that design should be concerned with enhancing product experience through sound.
The sound of a product can be manipulated to be more pleasurable, or to be quieter (silent, even;
see McDermott, 2013). That said, a near-silent hoover provides an example of a seemingly desir-
able product attribute, but one that failed when actually launched in the marketplace (see Wolkomir,
1996). Schifferstein and Hekkert have also pointed out that specific sounds might be associated with
particular products (or categories of product), and with distinct meanings, such as being fun, informa-
tive, playful, inspiring, even. This means, in our example, that the sound of the hoover might also be
desirable, if the noise is terms of its cleaning power within the target consumer group.
When it comes to technology and the role of sound (or auditory cues) in retail fashion contexts,
it has recently been demonstrated that people spend significantly longer (by about a third) interacting
with an augmented reality (AR) clothing display when realistic clothing sounds were presented when
their participants tried on various winter jackets (Ho, Jones, King, Murray, & Spence, 2013). Interest-
ingly, the participants in this particular study also reported that they would be willing to spend more
on purchasing the garment than when they only received visual feedback (as is typically the case in the
majority of AR clothing applications that are currently available).
Knöferle (2011, 2012) has pointed out how people's evaluation of a product (such as the taste of a
cup of coffee) can be modified by the manipulation of product extrinsic sounds (in this case, the sound
that the coffee maker makes). This effect was moderated by the consumer's enjoyment of the sound
of the preparation of the coffee (Houghton, 2014). Thus, it would seem reasonable to assume that the
sonic interaction between artefacts and between artefacts and other environmental stimuli can influ-
ence the degree of pleasantness in a particular retail shopping experience. That said, it is important
to note that individuals tend to differ in terms of their enjoyment of the (artificial) sound of products,
according to their personal/cultural backgrounds (Özcan & van Egmond, 2012). Besides the well-
mapped connections that have been reported in the literature thus far between sound and emotion, a
few other studies have offered a basis on which to ground this idea firmly on the basis of empirical
data. Bowles (2013, p. 98), for example, has reported that workers at Hermès "spent three seasons
finding the perfect sound a bag should make when it shuts."
Researchers have looked at the type of flooring as one salient factor concerning the environment
sounds that are elicited as a result of a shopper's interaction with specific products. Meyers-Levy, Zhu,
and Jiang (2010) examined the relationship between bodily sensations and the type of flooring dur-
ing shopping. They reported that a sense of comfort could be promoted in people simply by means of
the presence of soft carpeting while a hard tile floor was more likely to give rise to feelings of fatigue
instead.
Bresin, de Witt, Papetti, Civolani, and Fontana (2010) demonstrated that the sound feedback of
footstep can influence the human behaviour. Subjects were asked to walk using sensored shoes (for
providing auditory feedback) with four emotional intentions: happy, sad, aggressive, and tender. The
authors manipulated the ground sound texture four times for each emotion: wood panels, linoleum,
Modifying action sounds 155
muddy ground, and iced snow. Users tended to a faster pace (more active walking) when they listened
to walking surface sounds characterized by a higher spectral centroid (such as iced snow), and a slower
pace (less active walking) when the sound of the walking surface had a lower spectral centroid (e.g.,
muddy ground). More aggressive walking styles were found when participants listened to harder tex-
ture sounds, and more tender and sad walking patterns when they listened to the softer sounds.
Based on the literature reviewed above, it is clear that the sound made by products can evoke
meaningful associations in the minds of consumers (Özcan & van Egmond, 2012). Furthermore,
by providing or manipulating extrinsic product-related sounds, it is possible to change people's
perception of them, an effect that will likely be moderated by their enjoyment of these sounds (Ho
et al., 2013; Knöferle, 2011, 2012) and/or by their personal/cultural background (Özcan & van
Egmond, 2012).
As seen in those studies reported by Meyers-Levy et al. (2010), the floor itself can play a par-
ticularly interesting role in terms of moderating people's product experience and preferences. In the
present study, we were especially interested in the multisensory experience of consumers in the con-
text of a retail shoe store. We investigated whether the sound of women walking across different types
of flooring while hearing high heels would affect their emotional experience and bodily sensations.
Here it is interesting to note that certain shoe designers already purportedly play with the material of
the heels of the shoes design in order to change the sound that the shoe makes (cf. Quinn, 2012).
Therefore, in the present study, we studied the nature of any sonic interactions taking place
between the material of the heel of a pair of high-heeled shoes (polypropylene vs. leather) and the
type of flooring (ceramic vs. carpet). Our choice of stimuli was motivated by trying to use materials
that are commonly found in shoes and stores, as well as producing louder and quieter contact interac-
tion sounds. The results reported here help to advance our current knowledge by bringing information
concerning how the manipulation of the materials that may be used in real-world environments, such
as stores, can change auditory stimuli (interaction sounds) and consequently consumer experience.
To date, there have not been any specific studies on this subject. As such, there is a need to frame
general hypotheses about what might be found in this study, based on the tangentially related studies
mentioned above. The experiment reported here was specifically designed to test the general hypoth-
esis (H1) that the type of sonic interaction that a woman hears while walking would impact on her
self-reported valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD) scores, as well as possibly a variety of measures
of bodily sensation. Louder sonic interactions (for example, as resulting from someone walking across
a ceramic floor with polypropylene soles) were expected to evoke higher VAD scores, whereas quieter
walking sounds (resulting from someone walking across a carpet in leather-soled shoes) were expected
to evoke higher scores on the bodily sensation scales instead. Considering the possible relation of
diverse personal consumer backgrounds on the experience of the user, we also predicted that self-
reported consumer styles would be correlated with influences that these sounds had on women: (H2)
there is a positive correlation between how much a woman likes high-heeled shoes and VAD scores
only in the case of noisier sonic interactions; (H3) there are correlations between the self-evaluated
characteristics of "introverted" and "discreet" and VAD scores to quieter sonic interactions; and (H4)
there are correlations between the self-evaluated characteristics of "attractive" and "feminine" and
VAD scores generated in response to louder sonic interactions. Even though these hypotheses are
grounded in literature that is not specifically connected to the manipulated stimuli, it is reasonable
to believe that product sounds can change people's experience, and that they are moderated by their
enjoyment of these sounds and by their personal/cultural background (Ho et al., 2013; Knöferle, 2011,
2012; Özcan & van Egmond, 2012), such as personality traits.
2 Methods
A within-participants experimental design was utilized. Forty-eight female participants were recruited
with a mean age of 23.5 years (SD 5 6.6 years), a mean height of 1.64 m (SD 5 0.76 m), a mean
weight of 60.6 kg (SD 5 9.2 kg), and a mean body mass of 22.5 (ranging from 18.8 to 26.6). The
experiment took place in a design lab, with the participants tested individually. The entire experiment
took between 45 minutes and an hour to complete.
The participants were personally invited to volunteer for the study by one of the authors, in an
academic environment, with the authorization of the directors of the department. The experiment was
carried out in accordance with the relevant institutional and national regulations and legislation, with
the World Medical Association Helsinki Declaration.

The sounds of the four types of sonic interaction were recorded in a studio setting that had been
treated so as to avoid acoustic distortion. A Zoom H4N recorder was used to register the audio in
96 kHz/24 bits, converted to 44.1 kHz/16 bits, due to compatibility with CD reproduction systems.
The same young adult female, using the same high-heeled shoe in two versions (leather and polypro-
pylene soles), walked across ceramic and carpet flooring to generate the sounds to be tested, which
were recorded as stereo files using a pair of Neumann diaphragm condenser microphones (Model KM
184) using the XY technique.
Before the experiment, at the moment they arrived at the design lab, the female participants
responded to a preliminary questionnaire, concerning their weight, height, and age. The questionnaire
also included a question about how much the respondent liked wearing high-heeled shoes (scale from
0 to 10); and self-reported user styles (measured by 5-point semantic differential scales--from 22 to
12: introverted  extroverted, discreet  indiscreet, attractive  repulsive, feminine  masculine;
inspired by the Product Personality Assignment of Jordan, 2000).
In the experiment itself, the women were informed that they would walk around a "virtual run-
way" four times and would fill in a second kind of questionnaire four times immediately after each
walk, answering questions about how they felt while walking. The runway was built using Makey
Makey (http://www.makeymakey.com/). It consisted of 12 metal steps (approximately 10 inches wide
by 16 inches long), placed in a circular array (see Figure 1) and connected via wires to a compu-
ter and fixed on the floor with adhesive tape. When the woman's feet made contact with the metal
plates placed on the floor, they heard the sounds synchronized with their steps, played back via the
computer's loudspeaker (an Apple MacBook Pro), positioned 2 feet from the first step.
In a 2  2 design, participants walked barefoot over the runway. Each one of the four sounds was
played to each participant, in a random order. To be exposed to each sound, each woman walked a total
of 12 steps, while listening to the same sound 12 times (i.e., once with each step).
After being exposed to a sound, they filled in the questionnaire. The female participants were
asked to respond how they felt listening to the sound, describing the sensations that they experienced
(not judging the shoes or the sounds themselves). The dependent measures were valence, arousal, and
dominance, and bodily sensations.
Valence (the degree of pleasantness of a stimulus), arousal (the intensity of the emotional response
evoked by a stimulus), and dominance (the degree of control experienced by the person facing a stimu-
lus) (VAD) were measured using the self-assessment scale--SAM (self-assessment Manikin) (Badley
& Lang, 1994). In this technique, the participants rate their current emotional state via three scales,
which are, according to the authors, the three main dimensions of affect. Participants were presented
to the question: How did you feel while you listened to the sound of this high-heeled shoe? SAM is
a pictorial assessment technique, shown in Figure 2, to measure the three variables, using a 9-point
scale, from 24 to 14.
Bodily sensations were measured using an instrument from Meyers-Levy et al. (2010). Partici-
pants were presented to the following question: Concerning your bodily sensations, evaluate how you
felt while listening to the sound of this high-heeled shoe, rating the following items from 1 (not at all)

to 7 (very much). The items were comfortable, softly relaxed, physically supple, at ease, contented,
and restful.
3 Results
Table 1 shows results of SAM scores, compared by type of sonic interaction (polypropylene or leather
sole versus ceramic floor or carpet).
There is an effect of the type of floor on valence (F(1, 46) 5 17.07, p  0.001). Post hoc analyses
further revealed that valence was higher when participants heard sounds generated by ceramic floor
(1.04), as compared to the carpet (20.46) (p  0.001).
The effect of floor was also detected for the arousal scores (F(1, 46) 5 23.62, p  0.001). Post
hoc analyses indicate higher arousal when participants were exposed to sounds produced by ceramic
(1.18), as compared to carpet (0.38) (p  0.001). There was also an interaction effect between the
type of floor and kind of sole, when observing arousal scores (F(1, 46) 5 5.64, p  0.05). Post hoc
analyses indicate:
a) Arousal scores when hearing the polypropylene/ceramic sound (1.49) were higher than
listening to leather/ceramic (0.87) (p  0.05);
b) Arousal scores when listening the polypropylene/ceramic interaction sound (1.49) were
higher than when exposed to polypropylene/carpet sound (20.64) (p  0.001);
c) Arousal scores when hearing leather/ceramic sound (0.87) were higher than listening to
leather/carpet (20.13) (p  0.001).
For the dominance scores, an effect of the type of flooring was detected (F(1, 46) 5 5.89, p 
0.05). Post hoc analyses show higher dominance when participants listened to sounds created by the

interaction between any sole and ceramic (1.22), when compared to carpet (0.43) (p  0.05). There
was also an interaction between type of floor and kind of sole, when observing dominance scores
(F(1, 46) 5 7.02, p  0.05). Post hoc analyses also indicated:
a) Dominance scores when hearing the leather/ceramic sound (1.51) were higher than listening
to polypropylene/ceramic sonic interaction (0.94) (p  0.05);
b) Dominance scores when hearing the leather/ceramic sound (1.51) were higher than when
exposed to leather/carpet interaction sound (0.21) (p  0.001).
Valence and dominance ratings were positively correlated for the four evaluated stimuli: ceramic/
propylene (0.672, p  0.01), ceramic/leather (0.752, p  0.01), carpet/polypropylene (0.658, p 
0.01), and carpet/leather (0.597, p  0.01). Other significant correlation patterns among the dependent
measures themselves were not detected.
The results of the bodily sensations ratings, compared by type of sonic interaction (polypropylene
or leather sole versus ceramic floor or carpet), are shown in Table 2.
For the "comfortable" ratings, an interaction effect of the sole/floor contact sound was observed
(F(1, 47) 5 5.66, p  0.05). Post hoc analyses indicate that the sound of leather/ceramic (4.67)
evoked higher ratings than leather/carpet (3.83) (p  0.001). Ratings of "softly relaxed" also indi-
cated an interaction sole/floor (F(1, 47) 5 7.42, p  0.05). Post hoc results indicate that the sound of
polypropylene/carpet (4.04) had superior results than leather/carpet (3.48) (p  0.001).
For "physically supple," no significant differences were reported.
Observing the "at ease" results, an interaction sole/floor was detected (F(1, 47) 5 12.03, p  0.001).
Differences were found, reported by post hoc analyses:
a) The leather/ceramic sound (4.63) evoked higher "at ease" ratings than polypropylene/
ceramic (4.08) (p  0.05);
b) The polypropylene/carpet sound (4.38) evoked higher scores than leather/carpet (3.67)
(p  0.05).
Ratings for "contented" indicate a significant effect of the type of flooring (F(1, 47) 5 17.94,
p  0.001). Higher scores were observed when the participants listened to sounds of shoes interacting
with ceramic flooring (4.75) than with carpet (3.47) (p  0.001). An interaction effect of the sole/floor
contact was also detected (F(1, 47) 5 18.64, p  0.001):
a) The leather/ceramic (5.10) sound gave rise to higher ratings than the polypropylene/ceramic
sound (4.40) (p  0.05);
b) The polypropylene/carpet interaction sound evoked higher ratings than interaction resulting
from the combination of leather/carpet (3.19) (p  0.05);
c) The sound of leather/ceramic (5.10) gave rise to higher evaluations than the leather/carpet
sound (3.19) (p  0.001).
For the "resentful" evaluations, a sole/floor (F(1, 47) 5 5.88, p  0.05) interaction was detected.
Scores were marginally significantly higher, when the women listened to the sound of polypropylene/
carpet (3.60) than to the sound of leather/carpet (3.25) (p  0.074).
Summarizing the results observed in Table 2, it can be seen that the sounds of any sole touch-
ing ceramic evoked higher "contentedness" scores than those from contact with carpet; the leather/

ceramic sound generates higher scores than leather/carpet (measures: "comfortable" and "contented")
and than polypropylene/ceramic (measures: "at ease" and "contented"); and the polypropylene/carpet
interaction sound generates higher evaluations than the leather/carpet sound (measures: softly relaxed,
at ease, contented, and resentful).
Table 3 shows Spearman correlation coefficients between how much the participant liked wearing
heels and their SAM ratings.
Positive correlations were observed between how much the female participants liked high-heeled
shoes and their valence scores when listening to the sounds of ceramic/polypropylene and ceramic/
leather (the two louder sounds).
The results also highlighted the existence of a positive correlation between how much the partici-
pants liked high heels and their rating of dominance when listening to the sound of ceramic floors in
contact with the leather-soled shoes (one of the two loudest sounds).
Meanwhile, a negative correlation was reported between dominance and how much the partici-
pants liked high heels when the participants were exposed to the sound of carpet in contact with the
polypropylene sole (one of the quiet interaction sounds).
Table 4 shows Spearman correlation coefficients between self-reported personality traits and SAM
ratings. A negative correlation refers to the characteristic on the top of the cells in the first row (intro-
verted, discreet, attractive, and feminine), whereas positive correlations refer to the characteristics on
the bottom (extroverted, indiscrete, repulsive, and masculine).
For the loudest sounds (polypropylene/ceramic and leather/ceramic), valence was negatively cor-
related with attractive versus repulsive self-reported consumer styles, with subjects tending to associ-
ate higher valence ratings with femininity. Other correlation patterns were also detected for the evalu-
ation of these sounds:
a) Polypropylene/ceramic contact sound: Valence was also negatively correlated with self-
evaluated judgements of feminine  masculine, with participants exhibiting a tendency to
associate higher valence ratings with more self-reported femininity.
b) Leather/ceramic contact sound: Dominance ratings were negatively correlated to attractive
versus repulsive consumer styles, with women tending to associate higher dominance ratings
with more self-reported attractiveness.
The leather/carpet sound revealed no correlations with self-reported personality traits, but poly-
propylene/carpet did. Valence and dominance were negatively correlated with self-reported introver-
sion versus extroversion (higher valence and dominance associated to introversion), and valence was
positively correlated with feminine  masculine self-reported styles (higher valence associated with
masculinity).
4 Discussion and conclusions
The results of the present study highlight the profound effect that interaction sounds that a woman
makes when walking can exert on both their emotional responses and bodily sensations. Previous
research has reported that changing what a person hears can modify their perception of surface texture
(Guest et al., 2002; Jousmäki & Hari, 1998; Senna et al., 2014), product efficacy (Spence & Zampini,
2007; see also Byron, 2012), and even the crispness and carbonation of a variety of food and beverage
products (Spence, 2012; Zampini & Spence, 2004, 2005).

In the present study, we confirmed (H1) that the type of sonic interaction that a woman hears
would impact on their self-reported SAM scores, as well as possibly a variety of bodily sensations
measures, since in terms of the:
a) Emotional outcomes: any sole/ceramic combinations (the louder sounds) evoked higher
VAD ratings.
b) Bodily sensations: sounds of contact of ceramic with any sole evoke higher "contented" scores
than those from contact with carpet; the leather/ceramic sound generates higher scores than
leather/carpet (measures: "comfortable" and "contented") and than polypropylene/ceramic
(measures: "at ease" and "contented"); and the polypropylene/carpet interaction sound gen-
erates higher evaluations than the leather/carpet sound (measures: softly relaxed, at ease,
contented, and resentful).
An additional finding revealed that valence and dominance ratings were positively correlated in
the evaluation of how participants felt listening to any sound. Therefore, the degree of pleasantness
evoked by the sound (valence) is correlated to the degree of control experienced by the person facing
it (dominance).
Heel/floor interaction sounds also influenced participants' bodily sensations, reinforcing the
results reported previously by other researchers (e.g., Aglioti & Pazzaglia, 2010; Ro et al., 2009),
indicating that coding mechanisms in touch and audition might be connected. Hence, not only does
the contact with distinct kinds of flooring influence a participant's bodily sensations, as indicated by
the work of Meyers-Levy et al. (2010), but the interaction sounds between heels and the floor can also
play a similar role.
In the present study, we also predicted (H2) that there would be a positive correlation between
how much women liked high-heels and their SAM scores in the noisier sonic interactions. The cor-
relation between variables, although detected, was not as straightforward and simple as predicted,
because of
a) Noisier interactions: How much a woman likes high-heeled shoes was positively corre-
lated with (1) valence, while listening to the sound of ceramic floors, both interacting with

polypropylene and leather soles, and (2) dominance, while listening to the ceramic/leather
impact sound.
b) Quieter interactions: How much a woman likes high-heeled shoes was negatively correlated
with dominance scores, when she is exposed to the carpet/polypropylene impact sound.
Valence was positively correlated with the enjoyment of heels when listening to any sole interact-
ing with ceramic flooring, meaning louder sounds (the distinctive and bold sound of heels). Domi-
nance, in addition, was also positively related to the enjoyment of heels with the leather sole/ceramic
floor interaction, but still seems to be connected to the characteristic sound of heels. The mentioned
enjoyment was negatively correlated to dominance, when the participants evaluated how they felt
while listening to propylene sole/carpet interaction sounds; this fact suggests that this quiet sound (as
opposed to the loud sound of any sole interacting with ceramic) does not appeal to those women who
enjoy heels because it makes them feel dominant.
Finally, we hypothesized (H3) that there would be a correlation between the self-evaluated char-
acteristics of "introverted" and "discreet" and SAM scores to quieter sonic interactions; and (H4) that
there would be correlations between the self-evaluated characteristics of "attractive" and "feminine"
and SAM scores to louder sonic interactions. These hypotheses were partially confirmed:
a) Attractive and feminine were correlated with valence scores, when listening to the polypro-
pylene/ceramic sound.
b) Attractive was correlated with valence and dominance scores, when listening to the leather/
ceramic impact sound.
c) Introverted was correlated with valence and dominance scores, and masculine (the opposite
of feminine in the scale) was associated to valence, when exposed to the polypropylene/carpet
impact sound.
People differ in terms of their enjoyment of artificial sounds (Özcan & van Egmond, 2012); per-
sonal background, such as their enjoyment of wearing heels, can presumably influence the enjoyment
of a characteristic sound of a product. One might also imagine there to be an effect of the woman's
introversion/extraversion (Cain, 2012).
These results indicate that self-reported personality characteristics were correlated with variables
such as valence, reinforcing the view that a woman's personal/cultural background may play an impor-
tant role in the enjoyment of product sounds. In our study, distinct heel/flooring interaction sounds
were correlated with the self-reported personality traits in the study, reinforcing Schifferstein and
Hekkert's (2008) proposal that sounds might be associated with products, indicating meanings such
as fun, informative, etc.
The main implications of the results reported here are related to the findings that the type of sonic
interaction a woman hears can impact on her emotions and bodily sensations, and that the enjoyment
of these sounds depends on personal background (self-reported personality traits) and her enjoyment
of heels. It has already been well established that changing product sounds can modify product per-
ception, but this study provides evidence that changing interaction sounds between products and the
environment (e.g., heel and floor) can also affect emotional outcomes. Even though the results do not
allow the authors to make generalizations to other contexts, they nevertheless advance our understand-
ing concerning how sonic interactions affect multisensory perception and also that this effect is not
universal, since results were moderated by individual differences/background.
It is important to highlight the fact that even though the main finding of the study is that the sound
of high heels influences women's experience (especially when they make louder sounds), the known
relationship between loudness and emotional reactions (with loud sounds tending to be more arous-
ing), the effect can be related to the intensity of the sound, to the sound of heels itself, or to both fac-
tors. Since the enjoyment of using heels and self-reported personality traits moderated results, it seems
reasonable to think that the sound of heels itself is the main reason.
A potential limitation with the present study that should be flagged up here is the kind of experi-
mental manipulation (within-participants) that was used, and how this might have drawn the partici-
pants' attention to the experimental manipulation under study. Considering the results, it can be seen
as an opportunity to be explored in further research.
Another limitation with the present study that also should be raised here is to investigate just how
important the feeling of generating the sounds (e.g., the feeling of agency) is to the effects documented
here. Do the sounds themselves have an impact over people, independently from who is making them?

Since only the sound agents (women) were studied (not people around the walker), this offers another
opportunity for future research. Furthermore, there may be theoretical interest in investigating how
male participants who have never worn high heels would respond to these auditory manipulations of
interaction sounds.
Even though the participants may have been aware of the potential discrepancy between their own
somatosensory sensations and the auditory feedback that they heard in this study, the rationale that led
the authors to the decision to collect data with bare foot subjects was of an applied nature. We did not
want the aesthetics properties of the shoes to interfere in their rating, totally isolating the effect of the
sound itself on user experience.
Nevertheless, on the basis of the results reported here, the impact of heel/floor interaction sounds
on the experience of the user/wearer is undeniable, as is the relation between emotional outcomes and
personal characteristics, namely the enjoyment of heels and self-reported personality traits.
