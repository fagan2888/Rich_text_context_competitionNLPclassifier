ABSTRACT
Background: The term total folate intake is used to represent folate
that occurs naturally in food as well as folic acid from fortified
foods and dietary supplements. Folic acid has been referred to as
a double-edged sword because of its beneficial role in the preven-
tion of neural tube defects and yet possible deleterious effects on
certain cancers and cognitive function. Previous monitoring efforts
did not include folic acid from dietary supplements and are there-
fore not complete.
Objective: Our objective was to combine data on dietary folate (as
measured by two 24-h recalls) and folic acid from dietary supple-
ments (collected with a 30-d frequency questionnaire) with the use
of the bias-corrected best power method to adjust for within-person
variability.
Design: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey.
Linear contrasts were constructed to determine differences in di-
etary and total folate intake for age and racial-ethnic groups by sex;
prevalence of inadequate and excessive intakes is presented.
Results: In 2003­2006, 53% of the US population used dietary
supplements; 34.5% used dietary supplements that contained folic
acid. Total folate intake (in dietary folate equivalents) was higher for
men (813 6 14) than for women (724 6 16) and higher for non-
Hispanic whites (827 6 19) than for Mexican Americans (615 6 11)
and non-Hispanic blacks (597 6 12); 29% of non-Hispanic black
women had inadequate intakes. Total folate and folic acid intakes
are highest for those aged 50 y, and 5% exceed the Tolerable
Upper Intake Level.
Conclusions: Improved total folate intake is warranted in targeted
subgroups, which include women of childbearing age and non-
Hispanic black women, whereas other population groups are at risk
of excessive intake. Am J Clin Nutr 2010;91:231­7.
INTRODUCTION
Total folate is an umbrella term used to represent the different
forms of the B vitamin. Food folate is the form that occurs
naturally in food sources. Folic acid is the form of the vitamin
found in fortified foods and dietary supplements. The term di-
etary folate is used to represent food folate and folic acid in
fortified foods together. Total folate encompasses all dietary and
supplemental exposure to folate and folic acid.
Folic acid supplementation in the periconceptional period
unequivocally decreases the occurrence of neural tube defects (1,
2). For this reason, the governments of both the United States and
Canada instituted national fortification programs with folic acid
to enhance the diets of reproductive-aged women (3­5), and
neural tube defect rates decreased in both the United States (6)
and Canada (7­9). However, the fortification program increased
folic acid intake among virtually all segments of the population.
Whereas observational data suggest that increased food folate is
beneficial for prevention of some cancers and cardiovascular
disease, high folic acid intake may actually increase the risk of
colorectal cancers (10, 11) and cognitive impairment (12, 13) among
certain individuals. Therefore, careful monitoring of total folate
intake from food and dietary supplements is recommended (13, 14).
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) can be used to monitor dietary intake and
dietary supplement use of folate in the United States. The
NHANES data indicate increases in dietary folate intakes from the
prefortification (NHANES III) to the postfortification (NHANES
1999­2000) time period, but these data are limited in that they do
not include estimates of folic acid from dietary supplements (15).
With more than one-half of the US population reporting the use of
dietary supplements (16), monitoring folate status without in-
clusion of this potentially important contributor of nutrients is
problematic and incomplete (17, 18).
Some methodologic challenges have precluded the calculation
of total nutrient intakes from the NHANES data. First, the data
were collected over 2 different periods of time: food intake was
measured by two 24-h dietary recalls (ie, single-day estimates),
and dietary supplement data were collected through a 30-d fre-
quency questionnaire. Furthermore, both 24-h recalls and fre-
quency methods of dietary assessment are subject to different
types of measurement error (19, 20). Thus, nutrient estimates
from the 2 instruments may not be directly comparable, and

Previous methods have described how to adjust dietary estimates
from 24-h recalls to decrease within-person variation (21­25), but
little is known about the derivation of total nutrient intakes with
the use of adjusted dietary data. Carriquiry (26) has published
strategies to combine diet and supplemental sources of nutrients;
in this article, we use this methodologic framework to combine
dietary folate intake estimates from the 24-h dietary recall data
and the 30-d frequency questionnaire of dietary supplement use
to derive total folate intakes with the use of the 2003­2006
NHANES data.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The NHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional
survey that samples noninstitutionalized, civilian US residents
with the use of a complex, stratified, multistage, probability
cluster sampling design. All data were collected by the National
Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Briefly, participants were asked to complete 3
components: an in-person household interview, a health exam-
ination in a mobile examination center (MEC) '3 wk later, and
a phone interview to collect additional dietary data. At the
household interview, demographic information, dietary supple-
ment use, and some health-related data were collected. The
MEC visit consisted of clinical tests, laboratory studies, a di-
etary recall, and a health interview. Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants or proxies, and the survey
protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of
the National Center for Health Statistics.
The NHANES data are publicly available and are released in
2-y data sets to ensure confidentiality of the participants and to
allow for adequate sample size for statistical analysis. However,
the combination of 4 y of data may be necessary to produce
reliable estimates with the statistical methods required with the
complex sample design for more detailed analyses of population
subgroups. For this reason, the 2003­2004 and 2005­2006
NHANES data sets were combined.
The unweighted examination response rate for all participants,
which was calculated as the number of participants divided by the
total number selected for the sample, was 79% for the interview
component and 76% for the examination component in NHANES
2003­2004 and 80% for the interview component and 77% for
the examination component in NHANES 2005­2006. Only
participants over the age of 14 y were included in this analysis
(n = 13,468); pregnant and lactating women were excluded (n =
764), which left the analytic sample at 12,704. Of this sample,
12,119 completed both the interview and examination compo-
nents. From this sample, participants with incomplete dietary
recall data were excluded (n = 657); thus, this report includes
data for 11,462 participants.
Dietary data
24-h Recalls
All survey participants were eligible for the dietary interview
and dietary supplement use interview questions. During the MEC
examination, a 24-h dietary recall was administered by trained
interviewers. A second dietary recall was collected via telephone
'3­10 d after the MEC examination. Both 24-h recalls were
collected with the use of the US Department of Agriculture's
Automated Multiple-Pass Method (27, 28).
Folate bioequivalence
The bioavailability of food folate is much lower than that of
folic acid added to fortified foods and dietary supplements. The
dietary folate equivalent (DFE) conversion was developed to
reflect this differential bioavailability (29). Equation 1 shows the
conversion to the DFE metric:
1 DFE ¼ 1 lg food folate ¼ 0:6 lg folic acid from
supplements and fortified foods ð1Þ
Dietary supplement use
Dietary supplement use information was collected during the
household interview as part of the Dietary Supplement Ques-
tionnaire. The questionnaire was used to determine a sample
person's use of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary
supplements over the past 30 d. Detailed information about type,
consumption frequency, duration, and amount taken was col-
lected for each reported dietary supplement. The average daily
intake of folic acid was calculated for individuals with the use
of the number of days that the supplement was reported to have
been taken, the reported amount taken per day, and the serving size
unit from the product label. Missing information was assigned
a default value of the most commonly reported serving size, dose,
or frequency of intake.
Total folate intakes
The dietary folate intakes reported on the 24-h dietary recalls
were adjusted for within-person variability with the use of the
bias-corrected best power method to obtain a set of intermediary
values that reflected the distribution of usual nutrient intake from
food sources (22, 25). Each of the intermediary values was based
on data from a particular individual, for whom additional data
that concerned supplement use were available. Each individual's
reported average daily dose of folic acid from dietary supple-
ments was added to his or her intermediary value to produce
a final set of adjusted values that reflected the distribution of usual
intake of folate in DFE and folic acid separately in micrograms
(25, 26). Thus, dietary and total nutrient intakes were estimated
in 2 ways: 1) dietary and total folate in DFE and 2) dietary and
total folic acid in micrograms, because the Dietary Reference
Intakes are constructed in this manner. The estimated average
requirement (EAR) is for folate in DFE, but the Tolerable Upper
Intake Level (UL) is for folic acid in micrograms. Folic acid in
fortified foods, when converted to DFEs, can be used to meet the
EAR recommendations. However, the analysis that compared
mean intakes of the groups with the UL is for synthetic folic
acid only, ie, food folate does not contribute toward the UL.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS
software (version 9; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Sample
weights were used to account for differential nonresponse and
noncoverage, and to adjust for planned oversampling of some

groups. Mean and percentiles of dietary and total folate (DFE)
and dietary and total folic acid (micrograms) were estimated.
Mean dietary and total folate intake were compared with EAR,
and mean dietary and total folic acid were compared with the UL
(29, 30), to determine the proportion of the population that meets
or exceeds these recommendations, respectively.
Linear contrasts were constructed to determine differences
between mean folate intake for age and racial-ethnic groups by
sex. The referent group for the age comparisons was 19­30 y for
both men and women. For racial-ethnic groups, the referent group
was non-Hispanic white for both men and women. The SEs for all
statistics of interest (means, medians, proportions with usual
intake below or above EAR-UL, and linear contrasts) was ap-
proximated by Fay's modified balanced repeated replication
technique (31, 32) with the use of 32 sets of replicate weights
constructed with an initial perturbation factor of 0.7. Each set of
replicate weights was poststratified to control totals computed
from the initial sample weights. For the linear contrasts, a t
statistic was computed by the division of the estimate of each
contrast by its estimated SE.
RESULTS
The use of dietary supplements was reported by 53.4% of
NHANES 2003­2006 participants, and 34.5% reported the use of
supplements that contained folic acid. Non-Hispanic whites
(39%) reported a higher prevalence of use of folic acid dietary
supplements than did non-Hispanic blacks (19%) and Mexican
Americans (18%). Use and mean contribution from dietary
supplements that contained folic acid was highest for 51­70-y-
olds, with 47% of men and 53% of women in this age group
reporting use. In this age group, the mean (6SE) contribution of
folic acid from supplements was 436 6 21.4 lg, and 5% were
above the UL from dietary supplements alone when the sexes
were examined together.
In general, dietary folate intakes were relatively stable for
women across age groups (Table 1). In contrast, total folate
intakes (diet plus supplements) were higher in those aged .51 y.
Among men, no differences were noted in age groups for dietary
folate intakes. Men .51 y had significantly higher total folate
intakes compared with the referent group. Among both sexes,
non-Hispanic whites had higher total folate intakes than did non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans. Across all age and
racial-ethnic groups, men had higher mean dietary and total
folate intakes than did women (between-sex differences not
statistically compared). However, women had a higher per-
centage than men of total intake contributed by dietary supple-
ments (37% compared with 28%, respectively; data not shown).
Mean dietary and total folate intakes were compared with the
Dietary Reference Intake recommendations. The use of dietary
supplements as reflected in total folate intakes lowered the
prevalence of individuals who did not meet the EAR. More
women than men had inadequate intakes (ie, they did not meet the
EAR) for both dietary and total folate. Even with the use of
dietary supplements, 19% of 14­18-y-old and 17% of 19­30-old
women did not meet the EAR. A significantly higher prevalence
of inadequate intakes of total folate was observed for non-
Hispanic black women (23%) than for non-Hispanic white
women (13%). Similarly, a significantly higher prevalence of
inadequate total folate intakes was observed for non-Hispanic

men.
Mean intakes of folic acid from the diet (ie, fortified foods) and
from all sources (ie, fortified foods and dietary supplements) are
presented in Table 2. Women aged 50­70 y and 71 y had
significantly higher total folic acid intakes than the referent
group. The prevalence of excessive intakes of folic acid from
food alone was ,1% for women and ,2% for men; dietary
supplement use increased the prevalence of intakes above the
UL. Non-Hispanic white women and men had a significantly
higher prevalence of excessive total folate intakes than their
counterparts in other racial-ethnic groups. Approximately 5% of
women aged 51­70 y and men in the 50­70-y and 71-y age
group had total folic acid intake above the UL.
The shift in the folic acid intake distribution from the use of
dietary supplements as measured in micrograms with sex and all
age groups combined is shown in Figure 1. Dietary supplements
supply large amounts of folic acid, and the variability increases
as mean intake increases. The percentile distributions for dietary
intakes alone and for total folate intakes in DFE are shown in
Table 3. The difference in the percentiles of dietary folate and
total folate shows the effect of the amount of folic acid that is
added from dietary supplements. In general, for dietary and total
folate intakes, means were higher than medians for all age and
sex groups examined. This is suggestive of a significant skew to
the intake distributions and indicates that some persons have
a relatively high total folate intake. The magnitude of the dif-
ference between the percentiles of folate from the diet alone and
total folate intake increases as the percentiles increase.
DISCUSSION
This study used a strategy to derive total folate intakes, which
is based on previous work by Carriquiry (26) with modifications
suggested by Dodd et al (25). This method produced distributions
of total folate intakes by the addition of person-specific dietary
supplement intakes to adjusted dietary intake estimates of folate
with the use of a nationally representative data set for 2003­2006.
To our knowledge, this is the first effort to describe the population

status of total folate intake from foods, fortified foods, and dietary
supplements.
Several methodologic concerns must be acknowledged. First,
all estimates of dietary intake were adjusted for within-individual
variation, and these estimates reflect usual intake and assume that
reported nutrient intake from food sources on any given 24-h
recall day are unbiased and that the self-reported supplement
intake reflects true long-term supplement intake. Second, esti-
mates of folate in food depend largely on label declarations rather
than analytic values. Actual amounts are often higher than label
values (33). Third, the folic acid content of dietary supplements is
also based on label values; recent analytic data suggest that label
values also may exceed actual amounts (34, 35).
The fortification of the food supply with folic acid was
intended to enhance the diets of reproductive-age women. In this
study, '22% of reproductive-age women did not meet the EAR
through diet alone. When dietary supplements and foods were
examined (ie, total folate intake), 19% of 14­18-y-olds, 17% of
19­30-y-olds, and 15% of 31­50-y-olds did not meet the EAR
recommendations. Non-Hispanic black women also had a high
prevalence of inadequate intakes, with 29% who did not meet
the EAR through diet alone and 23% who did not meet the EAR
for total intakes. However, the NHANES data indicate that,
whereas some groups have inadequate intakes, other groups are
at risk of excessive intakes. It is important to note that when
examined separately, 4% of dietary supplement users exceeded
the UL simply from the use of the supplements alone. Ap-
proximately 5% of US women and men aged 50 y had total
folic acid intakes above the UL. Given accumulating data that
suggest high folic acid intakes in those with preexisting lesions
may increase cancer risk, older adults and those who use folic
acid supplements in addition to a high folic acid diet certainly

1 Dietary folate represents the combination of food folate and folic acid in fortified foods. Total folate encompasses the combination of dietary folate and
folic acid from dietary supplements. Both dietary and total folate are in the DFE metric.

should be cautious about intake amounts. Our results support the
earlier conclusions of Lewis et al (36) that a need exists to
improve total folate intake in targeted subgroups, which include
women of childbearing age and non-Hispanic black women,
while not putting other population groups at risk of excessive
intakes. In this article, we present the estimates for folate and
folic acid exposure from dietary and supplemental sources.
Given the underreporting of energy intake (37) and limitations
of both the dietary and dietary supplements composition tables,
careful examination of the biomarker data of folate status, in
addition to the dietary data, is a crucial next step to inform
nutrition policy.
Dietary supplements constitute an important source of
nutrients for large segments of the population, and more than one-
half of the US population reports usage. Previous research
indicates that dietary supplement users also tend to have high
dietary intakes of nutrients (38). Thus, the relation between
nutrient intakes from food and from dietary supplements is
complex and one that should not be ignored in human studies.
Furthermore, distributions of usual total nutrient intakes are
necessary to accurately monitor the population's nutritional
status and compliance with federal recommendations for sup-
plemental folic acid (39, 40).
The methods applied in this study provide a relatively un-
complicated means to account for dietary supplement use in
NHANES. The methods described here could easily be applied to
other nutrients or other samples. This method does not require
special statistical software; we performed all analyses in SAS.
Simulation studies (not shown here) suggest that the method
produces unbiased estimates of usual intake percentiles (41). Our
results indicate that '40% of the US population uses a dietary
supplement that contains folic acid. These data contribute to
national efforts to monitor folate in the postfortification era.
The authors' responsibilities were as follows--RLB, JTD, EAY, CAS,
MAM, VLB, KLR, and MFP: concept development and manuscript prepara-
tion; and KWD and JJG: methodologic and statistical aspects of the work and
manuscript review. None of the authors had a personal or financial conflict of
interest.
