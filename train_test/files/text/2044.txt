Abstract
Background: Several components of dairy products have been linked to earlier menarche.
Methods/Findings: This study assessed whether positive associations exist between childhood milk consumption and age
at menarche or the likelihood of early menarche (,12 yrs) in a U.S sample. Data derive from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004. Two samples were utilized: 2657 women age 20­49 yrs and 1008 girls
age 9­12 yrs. In regression analysis, a weak negative relationship was found between frequency of milk consumption at 5­
12 yrs and age at menarche (daily milk intake b = 20.32, P,0.10; ``sometimes/variable milk intake'' b = 20.38, P,0.06, each
compared to intake rarely/never). Cox regression yielded no greater risk of early menarche among those who drank milk
``sometimes/varied'' or daily vs. never/rarely (HR: 1.20, P,0.42, HR: 1.25, P,0.23, respectively). Among the 9­12 yr olds, Cox
regression indicated that neither total dairy kcal, calcium and protein, nor daily milk intake in the past 30 days contributed
to early menarche. Girls in the middle tertile of milk intake had a marginally lower risk of early menarche than those in the
highest tertile (HR: 0.6, P,0.06). Those in the lowest tertiles of dairy fat intake had a greater risk of early menarche than
those in the highest (HR: 1.5, P,0.05, HR: 1.6, P,0.07, lowest and middle tertile, respectively), while those with the lowest
calcium intake had a lower risk of early menarche (HR: 0.6, P,0.05) than those in the highest tertile. These relationships
remained after adjusting for overweight or overweight and height percentile; both increased the risk of earlier menarche.
Blacks were more likely than Whites to reach menarche early (HR: 1.7, P,0.03), but not after controlling for overweight.
Conclusions: There is some evidence that greater milk intake is associated with an increased risk of early menarche, or a
lower age at menarche.

Introduction
The age at which a female reaches sexual maturity represents a
critical transition in her life history. While to a large degree the
timing of menarche is under genetic control [1,2,3], environmental
signals of resource availability or stress, among others, may
accelerate or delay this life history shift from somatic to
reproductive investment. Under conditions of food scarcity, it
may make sense to delay menarche until sufficient energy
resources are available to support reproduction [4,5,6], while
familial or local social stressors appear to accelerate menarche
when social conditions are unstable and future survival is
uncertain [7,8,9,10]. A downward secular trend in age at
menarche has occurred when food resources have become
abundant and life-threatening childhood infections have dimin-
ished, such that over the course of the twentieth century age at
menarche declined from over age 16 yrs to below 13 yrs in
industrialized countries, and similar trends are evident in
contemporary developing countries [1,11,12,13].
Nutrient intake and storage during childhood may influence the
timing of menarche through hormones such as leptin and insulin,
and growth factors such as Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF-I), all
of which are involved in the regulation of growth and maturation
[1,14,15]. Chronic energy undernutrition has been linked to later
age at menarche [4,11,16], while overnutrition, characterized by
high BMI, has been linked to earlier onset of menarche
[17,18,19,20,21,22]. The effect of childhood nutrition on
menarche is contingent on the physiological template established
in utero and the infant period, with lower birth weight and rapid
growth in early childhood associated with earlier menarche
[15,20,22,23,24,25]. There is variation in age at menarche among
population groups in the U.S., with African Americans averaging
a younger age at menarche than Whites [17,26,27,28], while
Mexican-American girls have average ages at menarche between
those of Blacks and Whites [28]. This variation is not well-
understood, but is likely to stem from differences in experiences
with the factors just outlined [29]. There may also be population
genetic differences that contribute to variation in age at menarche.
While overall nutritional status mediates age at menarche, there
has been additional research relating specific dietary components
to this outcome. Low fiber and monounsaturated fatty acid intake
[30], high calcium [31], animal protein [32,33,34], and animal fat
intake [30,35] each have been associated with a lower age at
menarche, although not consistently across studies [36,37]. The

latter three nutrients are common to milk and other dairy
products, suggesting that the consumption of these particular foods
may influence the timing of sexual maturation. Milk supplemen-
tation studies designed to assess effects on bone mineralization
among peri-menarcheal girls have generally not found effects on
age at menarche [38,39]. Chinese girls receiving milk supplements
over 2 years were not more likely to reach menarche during the
supplementation period than girls in the control group (48.3%
compared with 40.1%; P = 0.09), and there were no significant
differences in age at menarche between supplementation and
control groups 3 years after the supplementation ended, when over
97% of study participants had reached menarche [40].
Typically mammals consume milk only during infancy, which is
a period of very rapid growth and maturation, and each species'
milk reflects the particular growth pattern and needs of its infants.
Milk contains calories, vitamins and minerals, and specific
biochemicals that enhance growth and development above and
beyond its nutrients and energy [41]. However, milk ­ indeed that
of another species with a different life history ­ is now widely
consumed by many humans well beyond the traditional age at
weaning. Milk comes most frequently from bovine species
(especially cows, Bos spp.), which have a radically different juvenile
growth pattern than humans, i.e. calves grow faster and to much
larger sizes [42,43]. The question thus arises as to whether
consumption of a growth-promoting substance from another
species throughout childhood fundamentally alters processes of
human growth and maturation.
IGF-I is part of the protein fraction of milk, structurally similar
to insulin, and a powerful mitogen that stimulates growth in a
variety of tissues. IGF-I is molecularly identical in bovine and
human milk and the concentration does not vary substantially
between the species' milks [44,45]. Animal protein in general and
milk in particular have been found to increase circulating levels of
IGF-I [38,46,47,48]. It remains unclear as to whether the IGF-I in
milk is itself responsible for the increase in IGF-I in circulation or if
milk stimulates endogenous IGF-I production [46]. Debate
continues over whether any IGF-I is absorbed intact or if it is
fully digested in the gastrointestinal tract in post-weaning age
children or adults [48,49].
IGF-I is associated with rapid growth [50], child height [47,51],
and pubertal development [52,53]. Milk consumption, IGF-I
levels, and height have been shown to be positively correlated
among children [47,51]. Current milk intake is not strongly
associated with growth in height among U.S. children age 6­
11 yrs [54], although it is positively associated with height and
BMI in preschool children [55,56], and height among adolescents
[54,57]. Dairy products have not been found to have the same
associations with growth in height [55,56]. Many concerns have
been raised about whether the use of synthetic bovine growth
hormone (rBGH or rBST) in cows to boost milk yield increases
IGF-I concentrations in milk and thereby accelerates growth and/
or sexual maturation. Monsanto researchers have reported that
there is no difference in IGF-I concentrations in commercially
available conventional milk, milk labeled as from cows not treated
with rBGH, or organic milk, which by definition cannot be from
cows treated with rBGH [58]. The Food and Drug Administra-
tion's conclusion is that milk from rBGH-treated cows is safe for
human consumption and that IGF-I levels are not elevated
compared to either human milk or non-rBGH-treated cow milk
and IGF-I is digested and hence not directly absorbed [49].
Currently only a small minority of cows in the U.S. are treated
with rBGH and many major supermarket brands of milk are from
farmers who pledge not to use rBGH (Mike Schutz, personal
communication; a precise accounting is not publically available).
Given that milk consumption is strongly encouraged and widely
promoted for children in the United States [59,60], and milk
nutrients and IGF-I are both associated with somatic growth and
pubertal development, it is valuable to ascertain whether milk
during childhood promotes earlier sexual maturation. To do so,
this study tests the following hypotheses: greater reported milk
intake frequency in childhood will be associated with a lower age
at menarche, or increased probability of early menarche, defined
as ,12 years [20] among U.S. women age 20­49 yrs, and greater
milk or total dairy intake and reported frequency of milk
consumption will be associated with an increased likelihood of
early menarche in U.S. girls age 9­12 yrs.
Materials and Methods
Data come from the publically-available 1999-2004 National
Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) [61], an annual
survey of health, diet, and nutritional status of the civilian non-
institutionalized U.S. population. Each survey covers ,5000
individuals across the age spectrum, and has a complex, multistage
sampling design. The 1999­2004 samples were merged for this
analysis, representing six cycles of data collection. STATA 10.0's
survey data analysis tool was used in all analyses [62]. As per the
NHANES analytic guidelines [63], sample weights were con-
structed for the six year composite sample. For women, the sample
weight was based on those participating in the interview; for girls,
it was based on those who completed the 24-h diet recall and
examination. All results presented here were based on the
weighted samples.
All females in NHANES 1999­2004 age 12+ years were asked
about their age at menarche during the interview. This was reported
in whole years, and so cannot be used as a measure of their exact
menarcheal age or to calculate a precise average age at menarche
for U.S. women. Available covariates that could potentially have
associations with age at menarche included: age, ethnicity,
education (less than high school, high school completion, post-high
school education, used here as a rough index of childhood
socioeconomic status, the only estimate available for adults in
NHANES), and whether or not the respondent had been born in
the United States. For this analysis only individuals self-identifying
as Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican-
American were included, due to the lack of specificity and small
samples sizes of the other two categories (``Other Hispanic'' and
``Other'') and research showing differences in age at menarche
among these three groups. Although members of these groups are
diverse and the groupings are not biologically comparable, these are
the labels used in NHANES. They will be referred to in this paper as
``ethnic groups.''
In 1999­2000 all adults age 20+ were asked about the frequency
of their milk intake at ages 5­12 years. This became a gated
question in 2001; adults were first asked whether they had been
regular milk consumers. Regular milk consumption was defined as
at least 5 times per week. Only those who reported being regular
or ``variable'' milk drinkers were then asked specific questions
about the frequency of their milk intake at 5­12 yrs. For this
analysis a composite variable was constructed as a measure of milk
intake during childhood. The following scale was used: 0 = not a
regular milk drinker or answered ``never'' or ``rarely'' to the
question ``How often did you drink any type of milk (including
milk added to cereal) when you were a child between the ages of 5
and 12 years old;'' 1 = sometimes or ``it varied;'' 2 = daily.
Consumption of all dairy products during childhood was not
assessed for adults in NHANES, so the analysis of adult women
will focus on milk only.
Milk Intake and Early Menarche
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e14685
Out of 4264 women age 20­49 years, 3840 were of the three
ethnic groups, reported whether they were born in the U.S., and
had information on education. Of these 3188 reported their age at
menarche and within this group 2657 reported their childhood
milk consumption. The sample of 2657 women included for
analysis here did not differ in age at menarche, education, or
frequency of childhood milk intake from the larger set of
NHANES women in this age group. Fewer women in the sample
were born outside of the United States (10% vs. 16%), and as
noted, the sample was restricted to the three ethnic groups. No
additional information is available about when a woman migrated
to the U.S, or the country of origin (aside from Mexico). The
sample was limited to women age 20­49 years to avoid cohort
effects on menarche age and milk consumption and recall
inaccuracies with advancing age. There was no association
between current age among women in this sample and their
reported age at menarche or frequency of childhood milk intake.
For girls in NHANES, 8­11 year-olds were asked only if they
had reached menarche yet while those age 12+ were also asked for
their age at menarche if they had reached it. No 8 year-olds with
information on covariates of interest reported attaining menarche,
so the sample was restricted to those age 9 yrs and older. A 24-h
recall provided data on milk and dairy intake and participants
were queried about the frequency of milk intake over the past 30
days. Since both the amount and frequency of milk consumption
decline markedly during adolescence in the NHANES sample,
older adolescents who reported their age at menarche cannot be
used to assess milk-menarche relationships as current intake is not
a reliable measure of pre-menarcheal intake. Therefore the sample
was restricted to 9­12 yr olds as milk and dairy intake (milk g,
dairy kcal, daily vs. non-daily milk intake in the past 30 days) did
not vary by age within this age range.
There were 1308 girls who were at least 108 months and less
than 156 months of age (9­12 yrs, inclusive). Of these, 1209
belonged to one of the 3 ethnic groups, 1076 had birth weight and
BMI information, 1048 reported their menarche status, and of
those, 1008 completed at least day 1 of the 24-h recall and
reported their frequency of milk intake over the past 30 days. Girls
in the sample did not differ from the whole NHANES population
of girls in this age group with respect to their likelihood of early
menarche, BMI, birth weight, milk intake from the 24-h recall, or
the frequency with which they reported daily milk consumption.
NHANES provides a full nutrient analysis of all foods consumed
and total nutrient intake from the 24-h recall. For this analysis all
types of fluid milk (plain and flavored milk, buttermilk, and
reconstituted powdered milk) were aggregated to provide total
beverage milk intake. A summary measure of other dairy product
intake (yogurt, cheese, and ice cream) was also calculated from the
24-h recall. The 30-day milk consumption frequency variable was
recoded into a dichotomous variable (daily vs. less frequent intake),
due to the low number of girls who reported never or rarely
drinking milk (n = 55, 4.7% of sample).
All results are reported as means (SE) or proportions of the
sample. X2 tests were used to determine differences in frequencies
across categories, and linear regression with categorical variables
was used to assess mean differences among milk or dairy categories.
For adult women, linear regression was used to ascertain the
contribution of milk intake frequency at 5­12 years to variation in
reported age at menarche, controlling for other covariates including
ethnicity, education, and whether or not the respondent was born in
the U.S. Cox regression was employed to assess the risk of reaching
menarche before age 12 using the same covariates.
For girls age 9­12 yrs Cox regression was also used to ascertain
whether frequency or amount of milk intake or total dairy kcal
affected the probability of reaching menarche before age 12 yrs.
Cox regression allows for censored data, and so girls under age
12 yrs who had not yet reached menarche can be included in the
analysis. This method of analysis has been used with other cross-
sectional datasets, including NHANES III, to compare risk of
menarche among girls age 10­16 [28], and in analyses of entry
into menopause [64,65]. Here age is a measure of ``time at risk''
and the data are right-censored (e.g. the 9 yr olds have not made it
through the entire age period of risk). Ethnicity, birth weight, total
kcal intake (from the 24-h recall) were used as covariates in the
base model Cox regression. Overweight status (BMII$85th
percentile; less than 3% of the sample was underweight [,5th%ile
for BMI] and none of those girls reported early menarche, so the
underweight category was combined with the normal weight
group) and height percentiles (,25th percentile; 25th­75th
percentile, $75th percentile), percentiles based on the WHO/
NCHS standard [66] were added to see if they mediated any
relationship between milk and risk of early menarche. Hazard
ratios for tertiles of milk intake (g), total dairy intake (kcal), dairy
protein (g), dairy calcium (mg), dairy fat (g), total fat (g) and total
calcium (mg), along with daily/less frequent 30-day milk intake
and milk consumption in the past 24 h (none vs. any amount),
overweight status, and height percentile grouping were calculated.
Results
Women age 20-49 yrs
Sample characteristics are presented in Table 1. Most women
reported daily milk intake from ages 5­12 yrs; only 8% reported
drinking it rarely or never. This varied by ethnicity and
immigration status. Many fewer White women reported drinking
milk rarely or never as children than Mexican-Americans or
Blacks, while women born outside the U.S. were more likely to
report rarely/never drinking milk than those born in the U.S.
Black women reported earlier menarche than Whites, and had the
highest frequency of early menarche. Women born in the U.S. had
earlier menarche than those born elsewhere. Education had no
relationship to milk consumption or age at menarche and was
dropped as a covariate in subsequent analyses.
Regression coefficients for predicting age at menarche (in years)
are presented in Table 2. Mexican-Americans and Blacks had
lower ages at menarche than Whites, and women who were born
outside of the U.S. had higher ages at menarche than those born
in the U.S. Differences among the groups were independent of
milk intake during childhood. The association between frequency
of milk consumption during childhood and age at menarche
suggests a negative association, although differences between the
``rarely/never'' group (the referent group) and the ``sometimes/
variable'' or daily intake groups were statistically significant only at
P,0.061 and 0.095, respectively.
As shown in Table 2, in Cox regression there was no difference
in the risk of menarche before 12 yrs between those reporting
drinking milk ``sometimes/varied'' (HR: 1.20, P,0.42) or daily
(HR: 1.25, P,0.23) and those who rarely or never consumed milk.
The same pattern of ethnic group differences was found for early
menarche, with Blacks and Mexican-Americans almost twice as
likely as Whites to report early menarche. Those born in the U.S.
had greater odds of reaching early menarche than those born
elsewhere.
Girls age 9-12 yrs
Characteristics of the sample of girls age 9­12 years are in
Table 3. Almost 19% of all girls in this age group reported that
they had reached menarche prior to age 12, although since many

were still below age 12, this is not the true rate of early menarche
in the sample. Milk grams, total dairy kcal, total kcal, total
calcium, and % overweight did not vary by age in the sample, with
the exception of the 11 yr olds, who consumed less milk and dairy
calcium than the 10 yr olds and less total calcium than all other
ages. Girls who reported less than daily milk consumption
consumed significantly less milk g, dairy calcium, and total
calcium than those reporting daily consumption (all P,0.001).
There were no significant differences in age among 3 ethnic
groups, while milk and total dairy consumption did vary by ethnic
group with Blacks consuming the least milk g and Whites
consuming the most total dairy kcal. There were no ethnic
differences in frequency of milk intake. Blacks were more likely to
be overweight than Whites but not Mexican-Americans. Over-
weight girls reported drinking significantly less milk than those
with lower BMIs, although 30 day frequency of milk consumption
and total dairy kcal and other nutrients did not vary by overweight
status. Girls with height ,25th percentile drank less milk than
those with heights $75th percentile.
As shown in Table 4, after controlling for birth weight, ethnic
group and total kcal, total dairy kcal, protein or calcium, and
frequency of milk intake over the past 30 days each had no
association with the risk of menarche prior to 12 yrs in Cox
regression. The only associations were with milk g intake from the
24-h recall, dairy fat, and total calcium. Girls in the middle tertile
of milk g intake had a lower risk of early menarche than those in
the highest tertile after controlling for birth weight, ethnicity, and
total energy intake, although significance was marginal (HR: 0.6,
P,0.06) and there was no difference in risk between the highest
and lowest tertiles. Those in the lowest tertiles of dairy fat intake
had an increased risk of early menarche compared those in the
highest tertile (lowest tertile HR: 1.5, P,0.05; middle tertile HR:
1.6, P,0.07 compared to the highest). A lower risk of early
menarche was found among girls in the middle tertile of calcium
intake (HR: 0.6, P,0.05) than those in the highest tertile.
Controlling for milk intake, total calcium, and dairy fat in the same
equation resulted in the same pattern (milk intake second tertile
HR = 0.6, P,0.04; calcium in tertile I HR = 0.6, P,0.006; dairy

height percentile group did not have a lower risk of early
menarche than those in the mid-range although the p-value was
close to significance (HR: 0.4, P,0.06). Overweight status
remained a significant predictor of early menarche after
controlling for height (HR: 1.8, P,0.01) and results for the dairy
variables and milk intake remained virtually unchanged.
With milk g, dairy fat, and total calcium in the model,
overweight girls retained a greater risk (HR:2.2, 95% CI: 1.4, 3.3,
P,0.001) for menarche ,12 yrs compared to girls with lower
BMIs, and girls $75th percentile for height continued to have a

(HR: 5.4, 95% CI: 2.5, 11.4, P,0.001) and those in the 25th­75th
percentile (HR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6, 3.6, P,0.001). Milk g, dairy fat,

those with greater dairy fat intake (HR: 2.7 95% CI: 1.8, 3.9,

compared to those with the greatest calcium intake (HR: 0.4 95%
CI: 0.3, 0.8, P,0.004; HR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4, 1.0, P,0.05, for

intake continued to be associated with a lower risk of early
menarche than the highest tertile (HR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.9,
P,0.02).
Discussion
A primary finding of this study was a weak negative association
between frequency of milk intake during childhood and age at
menarche for U.S. women age 20­49. Controlling for the same
covariates (ethnic group, whether the woman was born in the
U.S.), milk consumption at 5­12 yrs was similarly weakly related
to height in this sample (b = 0.84, P,0.06) and height and age at
menarche were positively associated (P,0.001). These consistent
results suggest that inaccuracy in recall of age at menarche is not

Milk Intake and Early Menarche

likely to be responsible for the relationship between milk intake
and age at menarche. There was no difference in the risk of early
menarche among women reporting different frequencies of milk
intake during childhood. Likewise, among 9­12 year old girls there
was no relationship between frequency of milk intake in the past
30 days and early menarche.
There was a negative relationship between quantity of milk
consumed in the past 24 hrs and risk of early menarche for girls 9­
12 yrs. Girls in the second tertile of milk intake had a lower risk of
early menarche than did those in the highest tertile. This
association was strengthened after controlling for height as well
as total calcium and dairy fat; thus milk's relationship to early
menarche is not mediated by associations between milk consump-
tion and childhood height or calcium or dairy fat. Total calcium
had a positive effect on the risk of early menarche, while greater
dairy fat intake was associated with a lower risk of early menarche,
associations that remained after controlling for overweight, height
percentile, and total milk intake. Other studies had suggested that
greater intake of milk or milk-related nutrients such as calcium,
protein, or fat contributed to earlier menarche [30,31,32]}. In this
study only greater total calcium and milk intake contributed to a
higher risk of early menarche in this sample from NHANES 1999­
2004. Calcium intake was correlated with overall dairy intake
(r = 0.20, P,0.001) and milk intake (r = 0.60, P,0.001), although
on average only 35% of total calcium intake came from dairy
products.
The finding that greater dairy fat intake was associated with a
lower risk of early menarche was unexpected but it was a
consistent and strong finding. It may be that dairy fat is strongly
correlated with an unmeasured variable that is related to early
menarche. It was significantly higher among girls reporting daily
milk intake, and this may be a marker for other behaviors that are
themselves associated with later menarche.
Ethnic differences in age at menarche were consistent with
other surveys [27,30] and were independent of differences in milk
intake. Among adult women, Blacks and Mexican-Americans were
more likely to reach menarche early, but in the sample of girls 9­
12 yrs only Blacks had a higher risk of early menarche than
Whites, and this disappeared after controlling for overweight,
suggesting that the variation in early menarche was mediated by
ethnic differences in BMI.
Similar to other studies [14,18,19,20,21,67], overweight and
greater height were associated with higher probabilities of early
menarche. Overweight girls had roughly twice the risk of early
menarche than those of lower BMIs; girls at or above the 75th
percentile for height had a risk that was 1.5 times those between
the 25th and 75th percentiles and 5.5 times those with heights less
than the 25th percentile. Height and BMI percentiles were strongly
positively correlated in this study (r = 0.30, P,0.001), but the two
independently predicted risk of early menarche. Although these
measures were assessed at the girl's current age, which for 18.6%
of the sample was post-menarche, the use of broad categories
(overweight vs. normal/underweight and 3 height groups) rather
than individual specific percentiles reduced the likelihood that
their index changed after achieving menarche. Studies have found
that BMI and height are not greater for up to 4 yrs post-menarche
for girls with early menarche compared with those with later
menarche [68,69] and that BMI is affected by other pubertal
markers but not menarcheal status among adolescent girls [70].
Others have shown that greater height and BMI are evident in
early menarcheal girls pre- but not post-menarche [22], that body
fat does not change with menarcheal status among peri-
menarcheal girls [71], and that girls are likely to stay in their
same percentile of fatness as they mature [72].
Also consistent with some studies of older children [73,74,75], but
not others [38,76,77], was a negative association between milk intake
and overweight although here the relationship was limited to milk
intake and not to overall dairy intake, calcium, or milk consumption
frequency. Controlling for overweight and height did not change the
relationship between milk and early menarche, suggesting that
underlying connections between milk and body size are not
mediating the relationship between milk and early menarche.
Previous analyses of NHANES data suggest that milk
consumption in earlier childhood is associated with both greater
height and BMI, after controlling for birth weight [55,56],
although milk intake in the ages leading up to menarche (6­
11 yrs) is not associated with height [54]. Rapid early growth or
gains in BMI, especially when preceded by impaired fetal growth,
are associated with earlier menarche [15,22,24,32,78], and so milk
consumption in early childhood may contribute to accelerated
menarche by upregulating early growth in body size. Thus milk
may be related to menarche through its contributions to somatic
growth and other mechanisms related to reproductive maturation.
Or it may act via a common pathway (e.g. IGF-I, although dairy
protein was not related to early menarche in this study), as IGF-I is
involved in both somatic growth and reproductive maturation
[79]. IGF-I has been correlated with milk and calcium intake, but
not with fat intake among adolescent girls [80]. Longitudinal
studies that follow young children's growth, milk consumption,
and subsequent sexual maturation and IGF-I are necessary to
assess these relationships.
Dairy intake may be a marker for other dietary behaviors or
related to physical activity, which was not evaluated here. NHANES
does provide data on physical activity, but it is measured differently
for children ,12 yrs and 12+ yrs, and thus it could not be used for
this sample. If dairy intake is correlated with physical activity,
particularly strenuous exercise, this may contribute to changes in
BMI and menarche. However, surveys of female adolescent athletes
suggest no difference in dairy intake with non-athletes [81] or lower
intake due to concerns about weight gain [82,83].
Other limitations of this study include the fact that NHANES is
a cross-sectional study, so causal relationships cannot be
determined; the need to use current dietary data for girls, which
may not be an accurate marker of long term intake in childhood;
the use of current height and BMI, which for almost 19% of girls
was post-menarche; reliance on a single 24-h recall, which is
subject to both under- and over-reporting and which may not be
indicative of overall dietary habits [84,85]; and the potential
correlations between milk intake and other characteristics that
may influence age at menarche. In addition, adult data on milk
consumption and age at menarche are based on recall of events
that may be quite distant in the past (e.g. the oldest women in the
study are recalling their milk intake from age 5­12 yrs, which is
37­44 yrs prior). Other researchers have used these data to gauge
the relationship between childhood milk intake and fracture rates
in post-menopausal women [86]. On the whole, studies that assess
the match between recall of dietary behavior in the distant past
and reported intake from historical questionnaires have reported a
range of results from high to low correlations, including for milk or
dairy products specifically [87]. Furthermore, some studies report
that recall diminishes with age, while others report no age effect
[87]. Recall of menarcheal age may also be faulty for women,
although one study showed that it was equally likely to be
overestimated by 1 year as underestimated by 1 year [88].
In sum, cows' milk may be a unique food in the human diet in
its capacity to alter life history trajectories as they unfold during
childhood. Its ability to do so appears unrelated or in addition to
its macronutrient profile (e.g. calcium). Dairy products, in which
Milk Intake and Early Menarche

bioactive milk ingredients are altered or rendered inactive, may
not have the same effects. It may be that milk consumption, which
evolutionarily would have been limited to very young children,
sends physiological signals that regulate somatic growth and
development as well as reproductive maturation, and insofar as
somatic growth in height or BMI is related to age at menarche,
milk consumption may have both immediate as well as indirect or
longer-term impacts on the timing of sexual maturation.
