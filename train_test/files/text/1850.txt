Abstract
Background: To examine the relationship between the metabolic syndrome and its components
and gait speed among older U.S. men and women. Whether these associations are independent of
physical activity was also explored.
Methods: Eight hundred and thirty-five men and 850 women aged 50 years from the continuous
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2002 were examined. We used the
definition of the metabolic syndrome developed by the U.S. National Cholesterol Education
Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Gait speed was measured with a 6.10-meter timed walk
examination.
Results: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 40.2% in men and 45.6% in women (P =
.127). The prevalence of gait speed impairment was 29.3% in men and 12.5% in women (P < .001).
No association was found between the metabolic syndrome and gait speed impairment. After
including the individual components of the metabolic syndrome in a logistic model adjusted for age
and leisure-time physical activity, abdominal obesity, low HDL cholesterol, and high fasting glucose
were significantly associated with gait speed impairment among women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]
= 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.26 to 0.89; AOR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.08 to 4.75; and AOR
= 2.05, 95% CI = 1.12 to 3.74, respectively). Further adjustment for race/ethnicity, education,
smoking status, alcohol consumption, arthritis status, and use of an assistive device attenuated
these associations; among women, abdominal obesity and low HDL cholesterol remained
significantly associated with gait speed impairment (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.76 and AOR
= 2.45, 95% CI = 1.07 to 5.63, respectively) while the association between hyperglycemia and
impaired gait speed attenuated to nonsignificance.
Conclusion: Among women, gait speed impairment is associated with low HDL cholesterol and
inversely with abdominal obesity. These associations may be sex-dependent and warrant further
research.

Background
Mobility is critical to maintaining independence and
social interaction in the later years of life and is an essen-
tial aspect of quality of life [1]. Persons with poor lower-
extremity function, slow gait speed, and particularly those
with walking disability, are at higher risk for chronic dis-
ease, hospitalization, and death than their peers who walk
normally [1-3]. Several general impairments and acute
and chronic conditions have been linked to poor lower-
extremity function and are often multifactorial [1,4,5].
One such condition, hyperglycemia, has been found to be
a strong predictor of disability and poor physical perform-
ance among older U.S. adults [6,7]. Other conditions,
such as heart disease, stroke, and hypertension, have also
been reported to predispose older adults to functional
decline [8,9]. Furthermore, modifiable health behaviors,
such as level of physical activity, may play an important
role in the prevention of chronic conditions that could
lead to functional limitation and disability [10,11]. Iden-
tifying risk factors for slow gait speed and developing
appropriate interventions may be the best approach for
preventing decrements in gait speed and delaying its pro-
gression.
One such risk factor may be the metabolic syndrome,
which the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program
Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) defines as the
presence of three or more of the following conditions:
abdominal adiposity, high blood pressure, hypertriglycer-
idemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cho-
lesterol, or high fasting glucose [12]. Approximately 27%
of all U.S. adults are estimated to have the metabolic syn-
drome, but the prevalence is even higher among older
men and women: 33.0% and 30.6%, respectively, among
those aged 40 to 59 years and 39.7% and 46.1%, respec-
tively, among those aged 60 years or older [13]. With the
epidemics of obesity and diabetes in the United States, the
metabolic syndrome is expected to be even more preva-
lent in the future [13,14]. Persons with the metabolic syn-
drome have been shown to be at increased risk for
cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, as well as for
death from cardiovascular disease and from all causes
[15,16]. However, there is minimal research on the asso-
ciation between the metabolic syndrome and its individ-
ual components and gait speed.
The purpose of this study was to assess whether the meta-
bolic syndrome and its individual components are associ-
ated with gait speed in a national sample of U.S. men and
women aged 50 years and older. Whether these associa-
tions are independent of physical activity was also exam-
ined.
Methods
Design and data collection
Beginning in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's (CDC's) National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) became a continuous sur-
vey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population
based on a complex, multistage sampling design. This
report is based on results of the first four years of the con-
tinuous survey, 1999­2000 and 2001­2002. Informed
consent was obtained from all participants, and the CDC
Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. A
detailed description of the continuous NHANES is
reported elsewhere [17].
Measures
The survey included an interview conducted in partici-
pants' households and an examination at a mobile exam-
ination center (MEC). Information obtained during the
interview included demographic data such as sex, age, race
and ethnicity, years of education completed, and house-
hold income. Interviewers also asked survey participants
about their health conditions and health-related behav-
iors, including questions about smoking; physical activity;
hypertension; and use of antihypertensive medication,
diabetes medication, and insulin. After the household
interview, participants were asked to undergo a health
examination at a MEC.
In accordance with the NCEP/ATP III criteria [12], we con-
sidered participants to have the metabolic syndrome if
they met three or more of the following criteria: 1)
abdominal obesity: waist circumference >102 cm in men
and >88 cm in women; 2) hypertriglyceridemia: 150 mg/
dL (1.695 mmol/L); 3) low levels of HDL cholesterol: <40
mg/dL (1.036 mmol/L) in men and <50 mg/dL (1.295
mmol/L) in women; 4) systolic blood pressure/diastolic
blood pressure: 130/85 mm Hg; and 5) high fasting glu-
cose: 110 mg/dL (6.10 mmol/L). Participants who
reported current use of antihypertensive or antidiabetic
medication (insulin or oral agents) were counted as hav-
ing high blood pressure or diabetes, respectively.
Waist circumference was measured according to standard
protocol by a trained NHANES 1999­2002 staff member
to the nearest millimeter [18]. During the health examina-
tion, up to four blood pressure readings were obtained. If
three or more blood pressure readings were obtained, we
excluded the first reading and used the average of the
remaining readings; if two readings were obtained, we
used the last reading; and if only one reading was
obtained, we used that. Participants' body mass index
(BMI) was calculated from their measured weight and
height (weight [kg]/height [m2]). Serum triglycerides
(after hydrolysis to glycerol) and HDL cholesterol (after
precipitation with a heparin sulfate and MnCl2
solution)

were measured enzymatically. Plasma glucose concentra-
tions were measured by using an enzymatic reaction.
Among participants aged 50 years and older, gait speed
was measured by observing them take a 20-foot (6.10
meter [m]) walk at their usual pace and timing them with
a hand-held stopwatch to the nearest hundredth of a sec-
ond. The stopwatch was started when a participant's foot
first touched the floor across the start line and stopped
when the participant's foot first touched the floor across
the finish line. Participants were permitted to use a walk-
ing device such as a walker or cane. We converted the
results into speed (meters per second [m/s]) to facilitate
comparison to other studies. Bohannon et al.'s [19] refer-
ence values for comfortable gait speed among older adults
were used to define normal gait speed; men with a gait
speed <0.943 m/s and women with a gait speed <0.713
m/s were classified as having a gait speed impairment.
Covariates included age (continuous), sex, race or ethnic-
ity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican
American, other), education (<high school, high
school), metabolic equivalent (MET) units of leisure-time
physical activity (0, >0-<22.5, 22.5-<35, 35; weekly),
smoking status (current, former, never), alcohol con-
sumption (none, moderate, heavy), arthritis status (yes,
no), and use of an assistive device (yes, no). Participants
were asked to report the frequency and the duration that
they spent participating in 48 leisure-time physical activi-
ties of moderate or vigorous intensity the month before
the survey [20-23]. Each physical activity was assigned an
intensity value by NHANES 1999­2002 that represents
the ratio of the energy expenditure of the activity to a
standard resting metabolic rate of 1.0 [21,23,24]. We mul-
tiplied each activity session by its corresponding intensity
value and summed this product for all activity types for
each participant: 
i
(number of times * METs)i
, where i =
a specific leisure-time physical activity from 1 to 48. This
produced an intensity-weighted frequency value for the
past month that we then converted into an average weekly
value. We then created 4 categories, based on recom-
mended levels of physical activity [25], that corresponded
to 1) no leisure-time physical activity (0 METs/week); 2)
insufficient leisure-time physical activity (>0-<22.5 METs/
week, where 22.5 METs/week represents the minimum
recommended level based on the MET value of 5 days of
brisk walking (4.5 METs)) [11,24,26]; 3) meeting the
minimum recommendation (22.5-<35 METs/week); and
4) highly active (35 METs/week; where 35 METs/week
represents 5 days of vigorous aerobic activity). A current
smoker was defined as someone who reported smoking at
least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smokes
cigarettes. A former smoker was defined as someone
smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime who
reported that they no longer smoked cigarettes. Those
who had not smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime were
defined as never having smoked. Alcohol consumption
was based on the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism's guide for screening for heavy drinking
among older adults [27]. A non-drinker was defined as
someone who reported not drinking any alcoholic bever-
ages in the past 12 months. Men aged 50­65 years were
considered moderate drinkers if they consumed 2 drinks
per day on average, as were men aged 66 years or older
and women aged 50 years or older who consumed 1
drink per day. Men aged 50­65 years were considered
heavy drinkers if they consumed more than 2 drinks per
day on average, as were men aged 66 years or older and
women aged 50 years or older who consumed more than
1 drink per day. A drink was considered as a 12-oz beer, a
4-oz glass of wine, or an ounce of liquor. In NHANES
1999­2002 no distinction was made between different
types of alcoholic drinks. Participants were considered to
have arthritis if they answered "yes" to the question, "Has
a doctor or other health professional ever told you that
you had arthritis?" Subjects who were observed using a
cane, walker, or another walking aid during the 20-foot
(6.10 m) timed walk test were categorized as using an
assistive device.
Statistical analysis
Among both men and women, we calculated the mean
values of continuous variables and percentages of categor-
ical variables of participant's general and clinical charac-
teristics, and across those with different number of
metabolic syndrome components; we calculated the age-
adjusted prevalence of gait speed impairment across par-
ticipants with different number of metabolic syndrome
components; and we calculated the prevalence of each
component of the metabolic syndrome and for the syn-
drome as a whole by gait speed impairment status. To age-
adjust statistics, we directly adjusted to the U.S. popula-
tion 50 years old in the year 2000. We determined
whether differences in these characteristics were statisti-
cally significant by using a Chi-squared test for categorical
variables and a t test for continuous variables. The unad-
justed odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the associa-
tion between gait speed impairment and the metabolic
syndrome and each of its individual components using
logistic regression. We then estimated the OR between
gait speed impairment and each of the 5 components of
the metabolic syndrome (abdominal obesity, hypertrig-
lyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, hypertension, and high
fasting glucose, respectively) after adjustment for age and
METs/week of leisure-time physical activity (Model 1).
Model 1 was further adjusted to include all metabolic syn-
drome components (Model 2). Finally, in the full model,
we include race/ethnicity, education, and all variables that
were moderately associated with the outcome variable
during univariate analyses. The full model was then
BMC Public Health 2006, 6:282 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/282

reduced by the stepwise elimination of variables with P
values  .05 with the exception of important confounders
(Model 3). We assessed the fit of the final model using the
Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test [28]. SUDAAN
9.0.1 (Research Triangle Institute, 2005) was used to
account for the survey's complex sampling design. All sta-
tistical inferences were based on a significance level of P <
.05. Prevalence estimates were calculated by using the
sampling weights so that the estimates were representative
of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.
Because concentrations of plasma glucose and serum trig-
lycerides were measured using reference analytic methods
only for participants who attended the morning examina-
tion, we limited the analyses to 1,915 subjects aged 50
years who attended the morning examination and who
had fasted 8 hours. Participants were excluded who did
not have complete measurements for all components of
the metabolic syndrome (N = 131) or had missing data on
the 20-foot (6.10 m) timed walk test (N = 99). Data from
the remaining 1,685 participants (835 men and 850
women) were included in the analyses. The age and sex
distributions of those included in the analyses were not
significantly different from those who were excluded
(both P > .05) [see Additional file 1].
Results
Table 1 shows general and clinical characteristics of partic-
ipants by gender. Men and women had similar percent-
ages of participants who were white, black, Mexican
American, or another race; had graduated from high
school; were obese; or used an assistive device. Men were
younger and were more likely to be current or former
smokers and to be heavy drinkers. Women were more
likely to not participate in physical activity during leisure
time, to never have smoked, to be non-drinkers, and to
have arthritis than men. Mean waist circumference and
triglycerides were outside the normal range in both men
and women, as was mean systolic blood pressure in
women and mean fasting glucose in men. Men had higher
values of waist circumference and fasting glucose and
lower levels of systolic blood pressure and total and HDL
cholesterol. Mean HDL cholesterol was within the normal
range in both men and women.
Overall, 40.2% men and 45.6% women (P = 0.127) were
defined as having the metabolic syndrome. Among men,
11.0% had none of the components of the metabolic syn-
drome, 19.7% had 1, 29.1% had 2, 22.8% had 3, 12.0%
had 4, and 5.4% had all the components. For women, the
figures were 8.4%, 21.8%, 24.3%, 21.6%, 17.6%, and
6.4%, respectively. As anticipated, BMI, waist circumfer-
ence, systolic blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, fasting
glucose, and triglycerides significantly increased with
increasing number of metabolic syndrome components
in both men and women. In participants with the meta-
bolic syndrome, high fasting glucose was more frequent
in men (P < .001) and abdominal obesity and high blood
pressure were more frequent in women (both P < .05)
(data not shown).
Table 2 provides the prevalence of individual components
of the metabolic syndrome by gender and gait speed
impairment status. Overall, the prevalence of gait speed
impairment was 29.3% in men and 12.5% in women (P <
.001). Both men and women with impaired gait speed
had a higher prevalence of hypertension than those with
normal gait speed; however, there was no statistical differ-
ence in the age-adjusted prevalence of this component of
the metabolic syndrome. Women with impaired gait
speed had a higher age-adjusted prevalence of low HDL
cholesterol, elevated fasting glucose, and the metabolic
syndrome itself than those with normal gait speed. In
addition, the age-adjusted prevalence of gait speed
impairment significantly increased with increasing
number of components of the metabolic syndrome
among women (Figure 1).
In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, no association
was found between the metabolic syndrome (i.e., the
presence of at least 3 of the 5 components of the syn-
drome) and gait speed impairment (Table 3). When
including the various components of the metabolic syn-
drome separately in the unadjusted model, both men and
women with hypertension were more likely to have gait
speed impairment than those without hypertension; and
women with high fasting glucose were 2.42 times more
likely to have impaired gait speed than those without high
fasting glucose. Adjustment for age and level of physical
activity attenuated the association between high blood
pressure and gait speed impairment to nonsignificance in
both men and women; however, among women the asso-
ciation between high fasting glucose and gait speed
impairment remained significant (adjusted OR [AOR] =
1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14 to 3.17) and
low HDL cholesterol achieved significance (AOR = 1.88,
95% CI = 1.04 to 3.41) (Table 3, model 1). After further
adjustment for the other metabolic components, hyperg-
lycemia and low HDL cholesterol continued to be signifi-
cantly associated with gait speed impairment among
women; and those who had abdominal obesity were less
likely to have gait speed impairment than those who did
not have abdominal obesity (AOR 0.48; 95% CI = 0.26 to
0.89) (Table 3, model 2). The associations between
abdominal obesity and low HDL cholesterol and gait
speed impairment among women continued to be signif-
icant after adding race/ethnicity, education, smoking sta-
tus, alcohol consumption, arthritis status, and use of an
assistive device to the adjusted 2 model (abdominal obes-
ity: AOR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.76; low HDL choles-

terol: AOR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.07 to 5.63) (Table 3, model
3). In the fully adjusted model, the association between
hyperglycemia and gait speed impairment attenuated and
was no longer statistically significant among women
(AOR = 1.84, 95% CI = 0.84 to 4.03).
Discussion
In this cross-sectional survey of the U.S. general popula-
tion aged 50 years or older, we found no association
between the metabolic syndrome and impaired gait speed
among either gender. However, our findings suggest that
among women, gait speed impairment is associated with
abdominal obesity and low HDL cholesterol even after
adjusting for age, level of physical activity, other compo-
nents of the metabolic syndrome (i.e., hypertriglyceri-
demia, high blood pressure, and high fasting glucose),
and other confounders. Specifically, women with abdom-
inal obesity are significantly less likely to have gait speed
impairment than those without abdominal obesity, and
women with low HDL cholesterol are significantly more
likely than those without this disorder to have gait speed
impairment.
HDL cholesterol may have further clinical relevance
besides the inverse relationship with coronary heart dis-
ease [12]. In fact, the results of this study are consistent
with findings of previous studies that have linked low val-
ues of HDL cholesterol to chronic illness, severe clinical
conditions, and functional disability in the elderly [29-
31]. For example, Zuliani et al.[29] found that, in a longi-
tudinal study of institutionalized adults over the age of 65
years, low HDL cholesterol levels were strongly associated
with severe disability. In addition, their longitudinal data
suggests that low HDL cholesterol is a potential indicator
for ongoing disability in basic activities of daily living
[29]. Our finding that gait speed impairment is associated
with low HDL cholesterol after adjustment for level of
physical activity may be explained by previous studies that

reported physical activity to have little effect on increases
in HDL cholesterol in the absence of weight loss [32,33].
The results of this study are not consistent with findings of
previous studies concerning the relationship between
abdominal obesity and impaired gait speed [34,35]. For
example, Angleman et al. [34] reported that, in periretire-
ment age women (i.e., aged 55 to 74 years), increases in
waist circumference best predicted risk for slow gait speed
and other disability outcomes. One possible explanation
for our inconsistent study results may be the applied cut-
point used to define impaired gait speed; Angleman et al.
defined slow gait speed as <0.6 m/s while we used <0.713
m/s. The inter-relationships between body size and pre-
dictors of morbidity and mortality in older adults (that is,
65 years) are controversial; and the confounding of

weight loss with chronic disease and age should be con-
sidered when evaluating these associations [36,37]. More
research is needed into the association between abdomi-
nal obesity and gait speed as well as the most appropriate
anthropometric measure to use in examining the relation-
ship.
Previous studies have reported an association between
hyperglycemia and impaired gait speed [1,4-7]. Many
older adults with diabetes do not attain glycemic control
targets [6], and effective blood-glucose control has also
been shown to delay the onset or slow the progression of
diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in
adults with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes [38]. Our
findings demonstrate that gait speed impairment is not
significantly associated with high fasting glucose in men.
On the other hand, a significant association persisted after
adjustment for age, level of physical activity, and the other
components of the metabolic syndrome among women.
Even so, further adjustment for race/ethnicity, education,
smoking status, alcohol consumption, arthritis, and use of
an assistive device attenuated the association to nonsignif-
icance.
Controlling lifestyle-related behaviors such as amount of
physical activity, consuming a balanced diet, and main-
taining a healthy weight, may prevent, delay, or improve
components of the metabolic syndrome as well as mobil-
ity loss [1,7,11,12,33,39-41]. Indeed, the role of physical
activity and weight loss (when appropriate) cannot be
underemphasized for their capacity to improve health
risks [32]; increased levels of physical activity are inversely
related to morbidity and mortality independent of meta-
bolic disorders and obesity [33]. In addition, comorbidi-
ties such as diabetes and coronary heart disease have also
been associated with strength impairment [42,43],
though strength impairment and other impairments may
also be prevented through strategies that incorporate
physical activity, self-care, and good chronic disease man-
agement [43]. Furthermore, earlier studies have demon-
strated a relationship between lower extremity muscle
strength and gait speed [19,44,45]; adults in their eighties
and nineties have achieved increased gait speed through
muscle strength training [44].
This study has several limitations. First, since components
of the metabolic syndrome are correlated, we are estimat-
ing controlled direct effects under the assumption of a
properly specified model and no unmeasured confound-
ing [46]. For example, we may not have totally removed
the confounding effects of physical activity, which has a
strong relationship to the individual components of the

metabolic syndrome and gait speed. Second, we were una-
ble to determine whether participants' impaired gait
speed was progressive or catastrophic, and the association
between the metabolic syndrome and its components and
gait speed may differ depending on the cause of the
impairment. Third, lower-extremity-strength and balance,
both prerequisites for the ability to walk [43], were not
addressed in our analyses; nor was weight loss which may
modify the effect of level of physical activity on our results
[32,33]. Fourth, because continuous NHANES 1999­
2002 was conducted among the noninstitutionalized U.S.
population, our results probably underestimate the prev-
alence of gait speed impairment and the metabolic syn-
drome and its components among the total U.S.
population. Finally, because of the cross-sectional study
design, we could not determine whether the relationship
between the metabolic syndrome and its individual com-
ponents and gait speed impairment was a causal one.
Conclusion
In summary, we found no association between the meta-
bolic syndrome and gait speed impairment. However,
among women, we did find a significant association
between low HDL cholesterol and gait speed impairment,
and an inverse association with abdominal obesity. These
associations may be sex-dependent and warrant further
research. If these conditions are not properly addressed at
the population level, their increasing prevalence may
translate into increased morbidity and mortality and
threaten both independent living and quality and years of
healthy life [1-4,13,14,19,43].
