Introduction
There are an estimated 70.1 million fathers in the United
States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012b). Yet, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau, a third of their children grow up with-
out biological fathers in their lives (U.S. Census Bureau,
2012a). When fathers are absent or uninvolved in their chil-
dren's lives, this may have deleterious effects on their chil-
dren's psychosocial development (Flouri, 2005). These
children are more likely to live in poverty, drop out of school,
and engage in risky behaviors like using alcohol, tobacco,
and illicit drugs (Nock & Einolf, 2008; Rosenberg & Wilcox,
2006). In addition, they are more likely to enter the juvenile
justice system and more likely to be incarcerated later in life
(Flouri, 2005; Nock & Einolf, 2008). In contrast, father
involvement contributes positively to numerous psychoso-
cial and developmental outcomes in children (Lamb, 2010,
Palkovitz, 2002; Pleck, 2010).
Research shows that fathers can be as competent as moth-
ers in their direct (e.g., caretaking) and indirect (e.g., finan-
cial support) parenting (Lamb, 2010). However, fathers face
a number of barriers with parenting their children, including
lack of parenting skills, personal problems, issues with the
children's mothers, and societal impacts such as economic
challenges. There is a fair amount of research about barriers
to father involvement that often reveal others'negative views
about fathers' contributions and potential (Malm, Murray, &
Geen, 2006; O'Donnell, 1999; O'Donnell, Johnson,
D'Aunno, & Thornton, 2005). Typically, these studies con-
sist of data solicited from the children's mothers, social ser-
vice workers, or other sources--but not from the fathers.
This study explored resident and nonresident fathers' per-
spectives about factors that facilitated or inhibited their abil-
ity to play a positive and active role in their children's lives.

and Barriers That Affect Their
Fatherhood Role

Abstract
This qualitative study explored resident and nonresident fathers' perspectives about factors that facilitated and inhibited their
ability to play a positive and active role in their children's lives. A total of 30 fathers were recruited from a support/mentoring
group and from the general population to complete a semi-structured, audio-taped interview. A content analysis revealed
that both groups of fathers were committed to maintaining a relationship with their children, and that by being present,
they protected their children, helped them emotionally and financially, helped in their overall development, acted as a role
model, and shared parenting responsibilities with their children's mothers. Factors that facilitated parenting for resident and
nonresident fathers included receiving proper guidance about fathering, a positive mother-father relationship, support from
family, and church. Inhibiting factors were more prevalent for nonresident fathers that included mothers obstructing the
father-child relationship, negative views/remarks about them as fathers, father-child visitation that is contingent upon child
support, and fathers' financial difficulties. The findings suggest a need for coparenting counseling, faith-based interventions,
and employment services to address the complex socio-economic challenges that fathers face.

historically delegated to mothers. Some researchers have
found that some fathers do not have a relationship with their
children because the children's mothers limit fathers' oppor-
tunities to engage with their children (Allen & Hawkins,
1999; Fagan & Palkovitz, 2011). Fathers may also struggle
with their own beliefs and expectations for relationships with
their children. Before men become fathers, they form their
ideas about fathering based on the way their own fathers par-
ented them (Coakley, in press; Lamb, 2010; Marsiglio,
2004). Fathers either want to emulate their own fathers' par-
enting because they admire their fathers' way of parenting or
they reject their fathers' way of parenting because it had a
negative impact on their childhood. Men thus form their
ideas about the type of parent they want to be. They might
identify as a father in a good relationship with the children's
mother jointly raising their children. Or they might identify
as someone who will have unconventional parenting strate-
gies as a single or nonresident father. If fathers do not have
positive examples of successful parenting, they often con-
tinue a cycle of absenteeism or poor parental involvement.
Their conceptualizations thus help explain differences in the
level of involvement fathers have with their children
(Marsiglio, 2004, p. 68).
Typically, fathers assume the role of protector and bread-
winner. However, they are increasingly supporting their fam-
ilies in a nontraditional caregiving role. Some researchers
assert that the distinctiveness of gender-specific roles is
important, while others contend that the characteristics of the
father as a parent are more important than the characteristics
of the father as a man (Lamb, 2010). Once men become
fathers, their perspective on fathering and fatherhood is
influenced by their personal experiences, which include their
relationships with their children and the children's mothers.
Mother-Father Relationship
A father who has a good relationship with the mother of his
children is more likely to be involved, spend time with his
children, and have children who are psychosocially and emo-
tionally healthier (Rosenberg & Wilcox, 2006). Similarly, a
mother who feels affirmed by her children's father and is
happy with the relationship is more likely to be a good
mother. The quality of the mother-father relationship thus
affects the parenting behavior of both parents. In good rela-
tionships, they are more responsive, affectionate, and confi-
dent with their infants; more self-controlled in dealing with
defiant toddlers; and better confidants for teenagers seeking
advice and emotional support (Rosenberg & Wilcox, 2006).
Conversely, research shows that children are more likely to
be anxious, withdrawn, or antisocial when their father dis-
plays anger toward their mother or refuses to cooperate or
communicate with her (Gable, Crnic, & Belsky, 1994;
Rosenberg & Wilcox, 2006).
Fathers who treat the mothers of their children with respect
and deal appropriately with conflict in the relationship are
more likely to have boys who understand how they ought to
treat women and are less likely to act aggressively toward
females. Girls with involved, respectful fathers see how they
should expect men to treat them and are less likely to become
involved in violent or unhealthy relationships. In contrast,
husbands who display anger or use the silent treatment are
more likely to have children who are anxious, withdrawn, or
antisocial (Rosenberg & Wilcox, 2006).
It is imperative that fathers interact with mothers amica-
bly because mothers are considered to be the "gatekeepers"
in child-rearing (Allen & Hawkins, 1999; Marsiglio, 2004,
p. 68; Schoppe-Sullivan, Brown, Cannon, Mangelsdorf, &
Sokolowski, 2008). For instance, mothers have the power to
control the overall manner in which children are raised,
including the amount of contact they have with their fathers.
According to the Center for Research on Child Well-Being
(2007), mothers' perceptions of fathers' trustworthiness
influences fathers' involvement with their children. Fathers
whom mothers deem untrustworthy to care for their children
are less engaged in activities with their children than fathers
who are considered trustworthy. Thus mothers play a crucial
role in facilitating the father­child relationship (Arendell,
1996; Marsiglio, 1995).
Economic Challenges
Historically, U.S. social welfare policy and programs, such as
public assistance, have provided financial assistance to chil-
dren and families who live in poverty. Very few Federal pro-
grams are specifically targeted to assist fathers. Because of
societal expectations for men to assume the role as a financial
provider and to be self-sufficient (Harris & Marmer, 1996),
the inclusion of men in social welfare policies entails holding
them accountable for financially supporting their children.
This may be due to the popular opinion in society that moth-
ers are biologically bound to carry out the role of caretaker to
their offspring, and thus are more deserving of government
assistance to support their children than fathers in similar situ-
ations (Coakley, 2013). The emphasis of public policy is
mainly on identifying the fathers of children in care to enforce
orders for child support payments (Day & Lamb, 2004).
This is unfortunate, because single fathers comprise
nearly 1.7 million of the U.S. population of fathers, and
many experience problems that are economically based. The
recent economic recession had a devastating effect on non-
custodial fathers, many of whom had difficulties securing
full-time employment during the recession. According to the
2010 U.S. Census report, the number of men working full-
time jobs throughout the year was 6.6 million lower than in
2007 (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, Smith, & U.S. Census Bureau,
2011). This is important to note because employment and
income are the strongest predictors of payment of child sup-
port (Nelson, 2004): Thus, fathers who are unemployed or
who have low incomes are more likely to be penalized for
nonpayment of child support.
Roberts et al. 3
Previous research has indicated that fathers encounter
various barriers to parenting their children. Some barriers are
personal or interpersonal, and some are imposed by society,
such as economic challenges. We explored resident and non-
resident fathers' perceptions about these factors believed to
facilitate or inhibit their ability to play a positive and active
role in their children's lives.
Method
Study Design and Sample
This was a cross-sectional, qualitative study of 30 fathers
from two North Carolina counties. The Institutional Review
Board from the authors' university approved all study proce-
dures for the requirements of human participants. Data were
collected from January 2012 through June 2012. The sample
consisted of resident and nonresident fathers from a fathers'
support/mentoring group and fathers from the general popu-
lation recruited using convenience and snowball sampling
methods. All fathers were at least 18 years old and had at
least one child age 18 years or younger.
Recruitment
The Guilford County Fatherhood Coalition assisted with
recruitment by distributing study flyers to members in their
voluntary fatherhood support/mentoring groups. In addition,
participants recommended the study to their acquaintances
who also were fathers. Potential participants contacted the
researchers by telephone or email, leaving their names and
telephone numbers. The researchers contacted the fathers by
telephone and read the consent form to them over the phone.
The interviewer then sent the informed consent form to them
via U.S. mail or email if the fathers wanted to participate in
the study. Participation was strictly voluntary.
Data Collection
Prior to their participation, the fathers were read the informed
consent form by the researcher again, in person. They were
asked to sign it if they still agreed to participate. Next, the
fathers were asked 10 questions regarding their socio-demo-
graphic background, including race, age, and marital status.
Then an audio-taped, semi-structured interview was con-
ducted either on campus in a private conference room, or in
the privacy of the participants' homes, if they preferred.
Participants answered the 10 open-ended questions regard-
ing their views on fatherhood and factors in their lives that
had helped them as a parent or created barriers to parenting.
The interviews lasted, on average, 30 min. Participants were
given a US$10 gift card to Walmart on completion of their
interview and a father resource guide of helpful community
supports for parenting education, counseling, support groups,
child support information, and employment information.
Data Analysis
The criteria used to help substantiate the trustworthiness of
qualitative findings include credibility, or accurately describ-
ing and interpreting participants'accounts, variability of par-
ticipants' accounts, neutrality/unbiased methods, and
generalizability of findings (Guba, 1981; Krefting, 1990,
p. 215; Sandelowski, 1986). To accurately describe fathers'
perceptions of their experiences, the interview process was
designed to make participants feel comfortable talking
openly and honestly. Most of the interviews took place in
participants' homes, and participants were further assured
that this was a confidential study and their identifiable infor-
mation would not be shared. In addition, one African
American male research assistant interviewed all of the
fathers who were mostly African American to encourage
their full disclosure about sensitive issues concerning race
and culture and fatherhood.
We used an etic approach (Strauss & Corbin, 1988) to con-
ceptualize the study categories. This approach coincided with
our objective to ensure that important categories from previ-
ous literature about fathers (e.g., barriers to involvement) were
included so that themes regarding fathers' viewpoint about
their parenting experience could emerge. A content analysis
was conducted by counting all occurrences of each theme
across the resident and nonresident household statuses.
All audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim.
The transcriptions were reviewed a second time by the
research assistant to ensure that there were no deviations
from the script that would have biased the results. Variability
of data was achieved, as all themes that emerged were
included.
The data were analyzed using grounded theory (Strauss &
Corbin, 1988). We used two levels of coding and categoriz-
ing the data, using a computer word processor (Marlow,
2010; Tutty, Rothery, & Grinnell, 1996). In the first level, the
first author identified "meaning units," fitted them into cate-
gories where the group had similar meaning, and assigned
names to those categories (Marlow, 2010). Codes were then
assigned to the categories and refined and reorganized as
needed. The second level of coding that helped to interpret
the data also was done with a word processor. The second
author retrieved meaning units from each of the interviews
into categories by copying and pasting the selected text from
the transcriptions. Next, the categories were compared and
contrasted to integrate them into themes. The themes were
saturated once the responses from latter interviews fit easily
into our existing categories. Information about the study data
can be obtained by contacting the second author.

(60%). More than 93% were the children's biological fathers;
about 6% were adoptive fathers. Among the sample, 27 were
African American (90%), 2 were Caucasian (6.7%), and 1
was multiracial (3.3%). Thirteen were married or partnered
(43.3%), 12 were single (40%), 4 were divorced (13.3%),
and 1 identified as "other" (3.3%). Sixty percent were
30 years old and younger. The majority of fathers did not
have a college degree. Approximately a third of resident
fathers and a third of nonresident fathers were employed full-
time, and more than half earned less than US$20,000 per
year. Many fathers (43.3%) identified having a specific reli-
gion or belief; most fathers felt that they had a good relation-
ship with their children's mother. A description of resident
and nonresident fathers' characteristics is in Table 1.
Interview Findings
Impact of fathers' presence in their children's lives. There were
six themes that emerged from fathers' descriptions of their
impact: (a) support children emotionally/convey that fathers
care, (b) provide for children financially, (c) help children
develop into successful adults, (d) share parenting responsi-
bilities with mother, (e) role models for their children, and
(f) protect children (see Table 2).
The vast majority of fathers expressed a desire to be a part
of their children's lives while describing the impact of their
presence in their children's lives. These descriptions were
not limited to explaining traditional role activities. Instead,
fathers' viewpoints help us understand the rationale behind
their use or application of different roles in response to chil-
dren's particular needs. For instance, fathers felt that both
parents should be allowed to tap into their own nurturing and
gender-neutral qualities when raising their children. One
father said,
If my children need to be kissed, I kiss them. If they need money,
I will try to give them that. If they need to be held, I will hold
them. But, in my household the mother give the soft emotions
and I give the hard emotions such as teaching how to defend or
take care of themselves.
Similarly, a second father stated, "If a child needs loving,
then that's the responsibility of the father." Another father
explained how a father's presence helps his children's devel-
opment and preparation as an adult:
I mean, to me it means everything. Without my daughter having
a father or anybody not having a father they already are in lack.
Meaning that whether a father has a daughter that's to show a
daughter how a real man is suppose to be and to make sure she
knows what not to look for. And as a son, a father having a son,
part of the job is to teach him how to be a man and how to carries
himself so I think fatherhood is very important um, and if a child
starts off without a father they're already in lack.
In addition, fathers noted the importance of modeling
respectful communication and behavior in front of the chil-
dren so that they could grow up with a positive view about
relationships, as well as develop positive self-worth. One
nonresident father described this:
It's important to keep that [mother­father] relationship intact as
far as, a reasonable relationship, not so much as, anything
Roberts et al. 5
emotional, but just reasonable. "Hey, look I'm here to pick up
my child," or "I'm here to pick up so and so I'll bring her back
at a certain time." Vice versa and it's okay and you go about your
way. And in a relationship, like I am, it's important just because
I just want to make sure that my daughter is getting a positive
scenery of what to do. With her growing up and with what she's
suppose to see and what she's supposed to see with a mother and
father that get along together and so that she can grow and have
a healthy relationship as she gets older.
Factors that facilitate good fathering.Seven themes emerged
from fathers' descriptions of factors that facilitated good
fathering: (a) early and proper guidance about fatherhood,
(b) emotional support, (c) good communication/good rela-
tionship with the children's mother, (d) caretaking help,
(e) coparenting/working together on behalf of child, (f) spiri-
tual guidance, and (g) economic assistance (see Table 3).
Several resident and nonresident fathers mentioned that a
variety of sources such as their family, others, church, and
even television shows like the Cosby Show helped shape
their role in fatherhood by providing them with these facili-
tating factors. In regard to what has helped him become a
good father, one father stated, "Well, first and foremost, my
own father." Fathers also felt that family support was an
important factor that facilitated fathering. In addition to
receiving help and encouragement from their parents, these
fathers reported that their grandparents, aunts, uncles, broth-
ers, cousins, and their children's maternal family members
were supportive. Below are two fathers' views:
Yes, I have my family. My mom she's very supportive and my
grandparents . . . my grandmother. Now they're very supportive
of me. So those are my two main supports. I don't really have
my child around a whole lot of people as far as different types of
people. My mom and my grandparents . . . grandma are the two
main supports that I have.
Family, her family is very supportive. My family is very
supportive. We actually have a great network of friends and
that's hard to, to have like, between her family, my family, and
both of our friends, we have a huge group of people that help
raise our kids. So, it's a blessing.
Resident and nonresident fathers desired to have emo-
tional support from their family and friends, and one father
reported needing to receive compassion and understanding
from the children's mothers:
Actually, I had recently been terminated from my previous job
. . . She supported me through this little time, even though I was
receiving unemployment she was still there to tell me it was
okay. Push me to go hard, push me to find something better for
myself and it's not just supporting me financially, but it's
supporting you emotionally and spiritually.
While some fathers felt that support was there, others felt
they lacked support to become a good father. One said,
Kind of learned it on my own. Like, my dad he wasn't really
there when I was younger so it was just like I know the feelings
that I had coming up, so like, why would I want someone else to
have those same feelings coming up.
When they did not have a father or father figure in their
life growing up, they sought other means for learning their
fatherhood role. A second father noted,
I pretty much learned from other people. Just interacting with
other parents, you know. I come across people that may have
their kids with them in public or you know, going to events that
involve a lot of parents with their kids. Ask questions if I'm not
sure of something or try to get an understanding on how to
handle being a parent in my position.
And a third said,
The best example is probably my neighbor's father, 'cause I
didn't meet my pops until I turned 13. And I always like, me
being a father, I always think back to what would he do in that
situation. 'Cause I feel like he was the best example that I've had
as a father.
The quotes below illustrate fathers' religious or spiritual
support toward good fathering, as well as support from spiri-
tual leaders to shape their parenting. They expressed that the

church is a home for many fathers, and church figures play
the role of a mentor as well to fathers. Some fathers who did
not have a father involved in their lives relied on church fig-
ures to teach them how to be a strong support for their chil-
dren. One said,
Mainly my relationship with Christ. I learned a lot just from
him. Love and you know, from a son to father love through
Christ. And my love to my daughter, you know that unlimited
love that he gives to me, that I feel for my daughter. You know,
I understand true love when I have that relationship with Christ.
That answers that . . . and my pastor as well, he preaches heavy
on being a father being, a real man and a man of Christ.
Another father said,
Church, church, church, church. It's big in my household. Every
Sunday we are in church, rain, sleet, or snow. On Wednesdays,
Bible study. Kids are in the choir because you got to have that
foundation, you know what I'm saying . . . Social services, they
do Medicaid but other than that, the food stamps. I provide for
them, but, church is the physical and like a second father to
them, you know what I'm saying. I tell them all the time, if I'm
not here, go to church. If for some reason you don't have me in
your life, stay in church, you know what I'm saying. Because
that's going to steer you the right way.
Factors that inhibit good fathering.Six themes described the
barriers to fathering: (a) economic challenges, (b) mothers
preventing father-child contact/custody issues, (c) others'
negative talk and views about fathers'ability, (d) seeing poor
examples of what fatherhood entails, (e) fathers not prepared
to care for child/receiving little information about parenting,
and (f) mother-father poor relationship/inability to work
together (see Table 4).
Fathers understood the importance of having a positive
relationship with the mother of their children. However,
some felt that if they could get along with the mother of their
children, it should not affect their relationship with their
children. One nonresident father talked about overcoming
his possible barrier:
We do not get along, if I don't do what she says or tells me or
request for me to do, I don't have access to my children. I'm
blessed because I'm starting to realize that my children know the
truth #1, and #2 it doesn't matter because they still love daddy
because daddy tries. Even though me and mommy are separate,
daddy tells you to come over and spend the night, then he picks
you up--daddy, and is involved in your life. So the real difficulty
is between a mom being angry or upset. Regardless if she still
loves daddy or not or loves me or not, it's just about using her
anger to stop me from seeing my children.
Some nonresident fathers discussed being subjected to the
mothers'gatekeeping to see their children. Often, fathers had
to endure some kind of unwanted interaction with the mother.
They expressed the need to have a relationship with the child
even if it did not include the mother. This did not necessarily
imply that fathers disliked the children's mothers. Rather, the
fathers yearned for a relationship with their children and pre-
ferred to deal with their children only. One said,
When I call or if I do decide to go by the house. Being told you
can't see your kids or "no, your kids can't visit you," by the
mother. There is only but so much you can do, I mean, you can't
just up and call the police and say, "hey I'm not able to see my
kids can you get my kids out the house for me?" Especially, if
you don't have any type of custody arrangements, you know,
those type of things . . . You have to go to court for those matters.
Also, I can't physically just go in the house and take them even.
You know, there is consequences with that. That's what's been
or who's been holding me back from my children.
Another nonresident father reported a similar challenge:
. . . probably about the only obstacle I can think of--for any
father-- is not being allowed to see your children. When you're
not allowed to see your children that's a very big obstacle. I
mean, you have to be able to speak to them. You have to be able
to spend time with them. And I'm not talking about just around
the mother or anyone else but you need time with them alone.
Personally, that's my only obstacle is not being allowed to see
my kids.
A third nonresident father noted, ". . . I decided to buy my
daughter a phone so we could talk to each other whenever
because I did not like waiting for her mother to let me call
her."
Some fathers felt they had adequate contact or visitation
with their children with support from the children's moth-
ers--albeit conditional support in some instances for non-
resident fathers. That is, they reported that their ability to
interact or have a relationship with their children was contin-
gent on whether the children's mothers were pleased with the
fathers' financial contributions or just happy in general with
the relationship between the parents. Fathers stressed that if

parents cannot get along with each other, that does not mean
they cannot have a relationship with their children.
Furthermore, they thought that it was important for fathers to
be able to communicate with the mothers about their chil-
dren, and set aside issues they had with each other. Some
nonresident fathers also shared their frustration about unrea-
sonable demands from the children's mothers regarding
child support. One said,
I do take care of my child, you know. I do give her things other
than child support. But no, I think that having some conversations
with her she expects me to pay more. Even though I live so far
away and only work part time and going to school. She expects
me to pay more.
Another nonresident father reported a similar experience:
Initially she didn't [support me] because I told her I couldn't pay
child support because didn't have a job. And once I got child
support and was paying it she started being more receptive to
me. And it wasn't like I didn't want to see my child because I
couldn't pay. And I don't feel like I should have to pay to see my
child. But, at the same time I know that there is a financial
obligation to see my child and that's my responsibility and I
don't mind that. But, if it was not for me paying my child
support, she wouldn't be so supportive.
Summary of Comparisons Across Household
Status
More often, resident fathers reported having a positive view
of the children's mothers in regard to what is needed to
facilitate good fathering (see Table 3). They stated that the
mothers supported them, and in hypothetical terms,
explained how challenges could be worked out between
them in order to set a good example for the children.
Conversely, nonresident fathers usually referred to specific
experiences that had occurred or a current situation that
could be exacerbated. Their accounts regarding problematic
relationships with the children's mother about child support
also included statements about how it would affect the chil-
drenorjeopardizethefather-childrelationship.Furthermore,
nonresident fathers reported more frequently than resident
fathers that they had experienced financial problems and
had challenges with child support payments. Resident
fathers, on the contrary, did not see the child support as a
relevant issue for them. Though, one resident father spoke
about having financial issues as it related to him needing to
prioritize spending choices. But, he did not indicate that it
had the potential to negatively affect the mother-father or
father-child relationship.
Nonresident and resident fathers felt that it was very
important to have a good relationship with the children's
mother. However, unlike the nonresident fathers, resident
fathers did not speculate about it adversely affecting their
father-child relationship or visitation. The tone of
nonresident fathers' interviews was more negative in regard
to the mother-father relationship and their financial chal-
lenges that they felt ultimately could affect the father-child
relationship. Moreover, they felt that if they did not pay child
support, then their children's mothers would talk poorly
about them and not allow them to visit their children. Only
one married father's responses reflected those of the nonresi-
dent fathers. He reported that one of his babies' mother cre-
ated obstacles for him. Mothers preventing father-child
contact/custody issues, economic challenges, and others'
negative talk and views about fathers' ability were the barri-
ers most frequently reported by nonresident fathers com-
pared with resident fathers (see Table 4).
Wanting to spend time with their children to fulfill various
fatherhood roles was common for resident and nonresident
fathers. However, resident fathers spoke of this phenomenon
casually, without having to consider barriers to enjoy the
splendor of those roles. Nonresident fathers, however,
referred to spending time with their children as a phenome-
non that could only be enjoyed if they could overcome obsta-
cles from their children's mothers.
Discussion and Implications
Nontraditional Father Roles
Our findings indicated that most of the fathers in this study
were very engaged in their children's lives, which is similar
to previous studies (e.g., Coakley, 2013; Malm et al., 2006).
Resident and nonresident fathers further reported various
benefits to their being present in their children's lives. The
frequencies of their reports did not differ much across house-
hold status. In addition to the widely accepted roles of pro-
vider and protector, fathers also viewed themselves as having
qualities of caregivers, role models, mentors, and nurturers.
However, they had serious concerns about how their chil-
dren's mothers and their family members perceived them as
fathers when they did not live up to their role as provider.
According to Lamb (2010), when parents assume less sex-
stereotyped roles, it leads to children placing less importance
on sex-stereotyped roles and children having two involved
parents rather than just one--and a high level of involvement
from both parents. This creates opportunities for both parents
to become fulfilled because they engage in activities that
promote closeness with their children. Nevertheless, fathers
in the present study acknowledged that their definition of
involvement and types and level of support they provided
might not be considered sufficient by others' or society's
standards.
There is a clear need to educate the public, social service
agencies, and fathers' families about the multifaceted father-
hood role. This is particularly important because society has
held on to preconceived notions about fathers as primarily
breadwinner and protector, making it difficult to accept the
idea that they deserve government assistance to raise their
8 SAGE Open
children and support their families. Educating the public can
bring more realistic views of the fatherhood role and the
types of services needed for fathers to support their children
and families (Rosenberg & Wilcox, 2006).
Parent Socialization
Nonresident fathers, compared with resident fathers, stated
more frequently that early and proper guidance about father-
hood and emotional support facilitated good fathering (see
Table 3). Our findings indicated that fathers learned positive
ways to parent from a variety of sources and in a number of
ways. Some fathers reported learning from their own fathers,
who talked to them about becoming a man and the responsi-
bilities of fatherhood. They expressed more often an appre-
ciation for receiving information about manhood or having
man-to-man talks with positive male relatives and nonrela-
tives (e.g., church mentors) than with various females.
Although fathers reported that their mothers had been sup-
portive, only two mentioned that they learned about father-
hood from their mothers. This lends some credence to the
popular notion that mothers can't teach a boy how to be a
man. Furthermore, this finding is noteworthy as it is esti-
mated that there are 8,365,912 (7.2%) households in the
United States headed by single-mothers (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2012c).
In regard to other facilitators of good fathering, several
fathers said that they were mentored by men in church about
fatherhood responsibilities, and spoke extensively about
church, God, Christ, the Bible, and spirituality. Given this
discovery, faith-based services might thus be an alternative
natural resource to men who are leery about seeking outside
assistance for their personal problems. Most church services
are free or virtually free, which is a huge bonus for young
fathers and fathers with low incomes. In addition, because
places of worship are usually local and familiar, they can
reach out to help fathers who have limited resources.
There was no mention from the fathers in this study about
learning about fatherhood from a formal class, books, DVDs,
or the internet--methods that are more readily available
today than ever. They may have failed to use these methods
because they involve costs that many fathers might not be
able to afford. Or they might have used these methods and
neglected to say so during the interview. In addition, fathers
recruited from a father support/mentor group did not state in
definitive terms that their present support/mentor group
facilitated good fathering. Although some reported that non-
relative males helped them, there is no way of knowing if
that included the facilitators or members in their group.
In the present study, only two fathers said that they had a
need for parent education or better parenting skills. However,
based on their overall disclosures about casually acquiring
fragments of information about parenting and seeing poor
examples of what fatherhood entails, there may be a need for
fathers to learn proper ways to parent their children to pro-
mote their healthy development. This is an area for future
exploration, as the present study did not solicit that informa-
tion. Nevertheless, we speculate that parenting education for
males could provide them with a more accurate view of
fatherhood responsibilities and roles and enhance parenting
knowledge and skills (Hook & Chalasani, 2008).
Financial Programs
One of the most critical barriers that emerged from this study
involves fathers' financial challenges. Nonresident fathers
reported that when they did not have the finances to pay child
support, their right to spend time with their children was
jeopardized. This finding is supported by previous research
that found that mothers were more likely to refuse visitation
if they did not receive financial support from the fathers
(Fagan & Barnett, 2003). Social workers should consider a
comprehensive socio-ecological approach to address barriers
that males face when parenting. For example, to address
fathers' financial challenges, programs in a few states are
evaluating the effects of modified child support payment
requirements on father involvement and children's outcomes.
However, it is unlikely that this will be an option in the near
future for the vast number of men in the United States.
Therefore, linking fathers with financial assistance services
is a realistic temporary solution, and linking them to employ-
ment services that lead to meaningful job placement would
be an effective long-term solution: 13.3% of the nonresident
fathers in this study were unemployed, much higher than the
national unemployment rate for adult men (7.3%; U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012).
Coparenting
Similar to previous studies on coparenting and the
mother-father relationship, nonresident fathers in this study
have also noted the barriers mothers create around child vis-
its (Fagan & Barnett, 2003; Fagan & Palkovitz, 2011). Some
fathers expressed feelings of exasperation and little hope
about interacting with the children's mother to be a part of
their children's lives. The majority of fathers wanted to have
a special time when they could bond with their children with-
out the mother looking down on them or influencing the chil-
dren to have negative opinions of them. Fathers said,
however, that regardless of barriers created because they had
a negative relationship with their children's mother, they
had a desire and obligation to do whatever they could to visit
and have a relationship with their children. Social workers
can play a role as family counselors by enabling fathers to
work with a mediator when things cannot be worked out
amicably between the mother and father.
Several of the nonresident fathers in this study reported
that they preferred to have little or no dealings with their
children's mothers when they visited their children or made
arrangements to pickup or interact with their children.
Strained relationships were reported as a potential challenge
to fathers'involvement with their children. Fathers may need
Roberts et al. 9
to learn how to coparent, an approach that places the mother
and father in equal parenting positions, strengthens families,
and helps minimize mother-father arguments (Allen &
Hawkins, 1999; Fagan & Barnett, 2003; Fagan & Palkovitz,
2011). Fathers can also overcome negative mother-father
relationships by gaining an understanding of the situation of
their children's mother. In addition, nonresident fathers who
are no longer in a romantic relationship with their children's
mother could benefit from information about dealing with
stressful situations that might lead to their walking away
when they cannot handle a situation, or reacting inappropri-
ately, which might result in their being incarcerated.
Sheppard, Sims-Boykin, Zambrana, and Adams (2004)
advocate for interventions with fathers and mothers together,
rather than addressing only fathers' issues, because both par-
ents are important for children's development.
Limitations
These findings are limited by the use of a convenience sam-
ple. Furthermore, some fathers were participating in a
fathers' support/mentoring group at the time of the study or
they were friends with someone who was participating in the
group. Therefore, it is likely that they were more knowledge-
able than many fathers about the supports available to them
or parenting strategies. They might therefore be more asser-
tive with advocating for helpful family or financial resources
that they feel they needed or minimizing challenges in the
mother-father relationship compared with those who were
not associated with a fathers' support/mentoring group.
Also, this sample was comprised mainly of African
American fathers; thus, the role of culture likely influenced
the findings. As we stated earlier, minority men have been
disproportionately affected by unemployment and low
income compared with Caucasians (DeNavas-Walt et al.,
2011; Harris & Marmer, 1996; Nelson, 2004), which can
inhibit their parenting.
In addition, understanding how the composition of the
fathers' childhood household would have influenced their
perspectives about their roles went beyond the scope of the
data. Future studies should include items about whether they
grew up in single-parent households and whether they were
male or female headed, as well as their current living and
formal custodial arrangements.
Finally, the sample size also adds some limitations.
Although it is typical to have a small sample in qualitative
studies, it is important to note that all the characteristics of
fathers, such as race/ethnicity or income level, were not rep-
resented here. Therefore, we cannot state definitively that the
findings apply to those fathers whose characteristics were
not represented.
Conclusion
Despite these limitations, the study provides useful insights
into fathers'views of their parenting. Resident and nonresident
fathers in the study strongly desired to raise their children and
contribute positively to their development. However, barriers
to fathering are much more complex for nonresident fathers.
Therefore, in their efforts to keep fathers engaged in success-
fully raising their children, social workers must understand the
differential effects that household status, as well as other cul-
tural factors, have on parenting supports and barriers.
