Introduction
Translating culture is an arduous task in translation studies,
an academic interdiscipline dealing with translation theories
such as culture, philosophy, and applications of translation.
The aims of translation studies are to approximate (recon-
cile) the source language (SL) to the target one, so as to cre-
ate the mutual and complete environment between the SL
and the target language (TL). Diverse cultures along with
diverse rites, thoughts, creeds, and behaviors are the most
challenging points in translation. But how can the renderer
transfer the exact sense of the source culture into the target
one? And does culture diversification really exist? To what
extent can the renderer create or simulate the intended situa-
tion in the TL to be understandable? Is cultural homogeniza-
tion the same as globalization? These are some pivotal
questions to be answered.
Nowadays, cultural homogenization or ethnic cleansing is
a vital aspect in translation studies. Translation seeks to dis-
cover some new ways in translation to integrate cultures and
then establishes the stable framework of culture. Therefore,
modernization is an asset in New Translation Studies (NTS).
In this direction, every state or country compels its citizen to
abide by some coherent rules for better living. Conversi
(2009) defines cultural homogenization as follows:
A state-led policy aimed at cultural standardization and the
overlap between state and culture. As the goal is frequently to
impose the culture of dominant elites on the rest of the citizenry,
it consists basically of a top-down process where the state seeks
to nationalize the masses. (p. 719)
This definition implies that translation is suffered from
hierarchy of cultures and languages. It means that whenever
the culture is in state of power, it ordains every rule, law, and
order. In this direction, the robust culture annihilates the
weak one; the process is called cultural genocide. However,
the world is being changed. Modernization and globalization
try to integrate and amalgamate the cultures to make a fixed
and stable culture. The idea of culture homogenization con-
jectures the unified, solid, and organic connection among
people. In this process, the identity of cultures will be
changed and need to be revised. Every time, amalgamation
of culture and identity has intrigued tourists, travelers, and
researchers. Both culture and identity are able to elicit con-
notational feelings of the people. That is because religion is
the rudimental aspect of every culture. People's creeds and
beliefs are an indispensable part of a community. But the
problem is that culture and identity are not always integrated
together. Many anthropologists have defined culture and
identity differentially with diverse scopes. For instance,

HomoKult: A New Model in Translation
Alireza Akbari1 and Mohammadtaghi Shahnazari1
Abstract
In New Translation Studies (NTS), cultural paradigm is of great importance to convey the approximate function of the
source language into the target language context. Paradigm of culture is treated differently in accordance with its different
definitions in that most of the studies carried out in this field show cultural diversification as the basic and rudimental part
of this paradigm. In Translation Studies, the translator has to do with two kinds of situations so as to transmit the meaning
and function of the culture. The first one is known as cultural diversification and the second one as cultural hybridity or
homogenization. The former is aimed at Old Translation Studies era, which investigates source­target dispersion. And the
latter alludes to source­target reconciliation. The present study seeks to investigate some void areas in translation and culture
and proposes a new model in which it makes some efforts to reconcile translation and culture via cultural homogenization
known as HomoKult Model of Translation in Gray Zone. The intended process consists of four subcategories: (a) Purposive
culture, (b) Ameliorated culture, (c) Circulated culture, and (d) Diglossic culture expounded in detail throughout this article.

Cummins (1996) defined identity as follows: "affirmation of
identity thus refers to the establishment of the respect and
trust between educator and students" (p. 4), while Tylor
(1871/1924) defines culture as a "complex whole which
includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, low, custom, and any
other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of
society" (p. 1). It means that culture and identity are entering
into the new epistemological era, and they are completely
separated from each other. Identity is personal and individu-
ally oriented. However, culture is group- or congregation-
oriented. This event is completely true in translation studies,
in that cultural homogenization and globalization are two
devices to direct this era. With the notion of cultural homog-
enization, some paradigms in translation such as description,
uncertainty, and purpose will be put in danger. In these cases,
culture diversification maneuvered in all directions and
accepted as the sole reason of power hierarchy in translation
studies. Given these explanations, how much the translator
can pass the red line of every culture? Red line in translation
studies means passing the borders of culture diversification
and staying the gray zone. Gray zone or area refers to any
special situation that facilitates the process of rendering to
make a fruitful and exact translation that is completely per-
ceivable for decoding ability. Decoding ability might be
defined as follows:
(1) The capacity of children whose vocabulary and cultural
experience are limited. (2) The double standard of capacity of
new literates, who can decode oral message with facility but
whose ability to decode written message is limited. (3) The
capacity of average literate adult, who can handle both oral and
written messages with relative ease; and (4) the unusually high
capacity of specialists (doctors, theologians, philosophers,
scientists, etc.), when they are decoding messages within their
own areas of specialization. (Nida, 1964, pp. 156-171)
Passing the red line means changing, playing, and annihi-
lating with people's creeds. Is the translator or interpreter
allowed to pass this line? If she or he passes, what should be
done to lessen the degree of anger? Totally, in the first place
of culture homogenization, most of the people shun accept-
ing this notion. That is because of the fact that their culture is
going to be changed or amalgamated with unknown culture.
Establishing a cross-cultural connection along with one sta-
ble or Mother Culture is an ordeal but a possible task. Before
making the established framework of culture, a good defini-
tion of culture is of great importance. Griswold (1994)
defines culture as "that complex whole which includes
knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other
capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of soci-
ety" (p. 8). This definition seems to be so vast that each sec-
tion cannot be scrutinized separately. In this direction, one
must depict the paradigm of this definition into several
points: (a) Cultural substances involve the artifacts, build-
ings, implements, tools, and painting; (b) cultural non-sub-
stances include the way of dancing, song, garment, and
special accent; (c) cultural environment involves flora and
fauna such as Rampike and Panda; and (d) cultural behavior
consists of beliefs, creeds, values, attitudes, and meaningful-
ness. These four categories are completely true for every cul-
ture and the way of performing is completely different.
Culture can be investigated from the other angles such as
politics, consumerism, and consumption. But the question is,
"How vastly do the cultures differ?" Is there any light to shed
on cultural homogenization?
Today, we live in a globalized era, and everyone speaks
about progression. How will it be possible to progress with-
out taking a step toward cultural integration? How will it be
possible to live in an uncertain era? And how would it be
possible not to consider any factors in integration of cul-
tures? Answering such questions needs rudimental and piv-
otal studying in this field. Therefore, one must express that
cultural homogenization diminishes existing cultures or rites
to a superficial and non-fastidious period in which signifi-
cant discrepancies will be reduced and become completely
understandable for the bystanders in every culture. Finally,
cultural homogenization is an open expression of culture,
which is thoroughly applicable in every field of studies, espe-
cially in translation studies.
Last but not least, the rationale behind focusing on cul-
tural homogenization stemmed from the condition that cul-
ture would be treated differently and one cannot build the
stable framework of the intended term, particularly in the
field of translation study, which concentrates on source and
target language culture to see the similarities and differences.
Therefore, the aim of this study is to scrutinize cultural pos-
sibilities in translation. Discerning these possibilities in
translation requires some strategies or subcategories utilized
by the translator to affiliate the bridge of the source to that of
the TL culture. Finally, this study seeks to peruse four sub-
categories of HomoKult Model of Translation to amalgamate
SL to TL and make the translation or interpretation homog-
enize so as to be completely understandable, especially for
decoding ability.
Review of Literature
Definition of Culture
It is completely natural to say that all people by nature know
the exact meaning of the culture. For the ease of the reader, it
is better to clarify "culture" by an example. In 1995, all of the
membership of the European Union felt depressed about the
Britain's referendum, and nearly one in two respondents
expressed their dissatisfaction. It is because of the fact that
they said we all did not belong to such culture. Defining the
real and decisive meaning of culture is a difficult task in
every field. Alfred Louis Kroeber and Clyde Kluckhohn
(1952) define culture as follows:
Patterns, explicit and implicit of and for behavior acquired and
transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement
Akbari and Shahnazari 3
of human groups, including their embodiment in artefacts; the
essential core of culture consists of traditional (i.e. historically
derived and selected) ideas and especially their attached values.
Culture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products
of action, on the other hand, as conditioning elements of future
action. (p. 181)
The last part of this definition implies that, in future, the
system of culture may change, and it will be ready to be
replaced. This suggests that all culture may amalgamate with
each other and then become one in this process. At that time,
hierarchy of cultures is useless, and there do not exist any
culture dominations. Ned Seeleye (1984) described culture
as, "I know of no way to better ensure having nothing pro-
ductive happen than for a language department to begin its
approach to culture by theoretical concerns for defining the
term" (p. 13). In this direction, Seeleye cannot define culture
for the way it is, and he just utilized circumlocution. Finally,
according to Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics
(Asher, 1994), defining culture is effortless: "Despite the
century of efforts to define culture adequately, there was in
the early 1990s no agreement among anthropologist regard-
ing its nature" (p. 2001). It is better to say that Gail Robinson
(1988) categorizes the definition of culture into two sub-
groups: (a) external and (b) internal culture. The former
alludes to behavior such as language, gestures, customs, and
habits. And then products belong to literature, folklore, art,
music, and artifacts. The latter refers to ideas such as beliefs,
values, and institutions. She then defines the term culture in
accordance with some approaches such as behaviorist, func-
tionalist, ethno-centrism, cognitive, and dynamism.
Theories on Culture
The term culture has been defined variously during the
period of time. It is important to say that the definition of
culture depends on the era in which people live. Therefore,
depicting the stable definition is approximately impossible.
Every time, nations expressed culture in accordance with
their taste and it is not surprising to ponder the fixed and
well-balanced meaning. Among all of the theories of culture,
some of them are astonishing to scrutinize to make this study
tangible.
The IcebergTheory. The Iceberg Theory defined culture many
years ago. Hall (1990, p.2 ) worked on this area to corrobo-
rate the nature of culture directly. He then added that the
most brilliant portion of culture was concealed, and all things
in culture would be "just the tip of the iceberg." The other
distinction is related to Clyde and Florence Kluckhohn's
explicit and implicit, and Ralph Linton's category between
covert and overt. Explicit information in cultural studies
refers to the surface layer of the culture while the latter
alludes to deep structure of the culture. Every successful cul-
ture amalgamates the deep layer of language to the surface
language, which completely exhaustive and comprehensible
in this direction. Linton's category covers approximately all
the factors in culture in that covert culture covers all the dis-
crepancies and similarities in raw form and the latter covers
the practical aspects of culture in this regard. But, the most
important factor is that when a translator, renderer, and the
interpreter seek to deal with the covert aspect of culture, he
or she should consider the red line in culture. It means that
every culture has some limitations, which the renderer has to
observe prior to the act of translating. Therefore, connecting
the covert layer of culture to the surface layer will be an
arduous task in translation studies.
The most recent amelioration of Iceberg Theory is related
to the division of Brake, Medina-Walker, and Walker (1995):
Laws, customs, rituals, gestures, ways of dressing, food and
drink and method of greeting, and saying goodbye . . . These are
all part of culture, but they are just the tip of the cultural iceberg.
The most powerful elements of culture are those that lie beneath
the surface of everyday interaction. We call these values
orientation. Value orientations are preferences for certain
outcomes over there. (pp. 34-39)
This definition suggests that the translator should con-
sider the beneath and surface interaction in the text. Deep
structure of the texts should be based on the common rudi-
mental aspects that are completely understandable for all
people. And the surface structure is going to trim text delica-
cies. Text delicacies in culture refer to some different aspects
of culture that are thoroughly localized.
As can be observed in Figure 1, some rudimental aspects
such as personality styles, assumptions, norms, expectation,
and beliefs are pertained to the deep layer of the iceberg. And
some aspects such as behaviors, appearance, dress codes,
and customs are related to the other layer called the surface
structure.
In NTS, there is nothing to do with differences. Everything
can be scrutinized in the way of similarities and

then the renderer seeks to institutionalize translation as the
homogeneous act. In this regard, every model and theory that
are against the Universal Translation must be eliminated or
revised. All these processes are directly connected to the
translator's cognition to mix the SL culture to the approxi-
mate TL culture as well.
Formal culture.Formal culture is a kind of culture that is
completely prevalent in one society. It can be stated that this
sort of culture is exclusive of a particular region in this direc-
tion. Habits, customs, beliefs, and behaviors are the most
important issues in the above-mentioned culture. Formal cul-
ture is no longer objective (Katan, 1999) in that it works on
the surface level of the culture. The framework of this culture
is thoroughly utilizable in rendering the TL superficially, and
it scrutinizes the surface level of the unit of translation. For
instance, Distinti Saluti in the Italian language can be ren-
dered as "Yours faithfully." In this regard, the renderer
should resort himself or herself to formal and framework of
target culture to transmit the exact sense of the SL directly.
As another example, Spettabile Ditta will be translated as
"Dear Sir/Madam" to show source­target overlap. In the
above example, the renderer seeks to cover the overlap and
then situates itself in gray zone or area. Formal culture should
be taught to preserve rites, traditions, beliefs, and customs.
Formal culture is devoted to trials and errors and is not per-
tained to the social conventions of the society. It is better to
say that formal culture scrutinizes the norms of the society
approximately as it has investigated the right or wrong, ade-
quate or inadequate, and acceptable or unacceptable rules of
the community in this regard.
Cognitive culture. Culture as a particular cognitive system is
pertained to the anthropological aspects of culture, in that it
inspects human interaction in diverse situations to depict one
fixed and stable framework of the culture. In this connection,
Ward Goodenough (1963) argued,
A society's culture consists of whatever it is one has to know or
believes in order to operate in a manner acceptable to its member.
Culture is not the material phenomenon; it does not consist of
thing, people, behavior, or emotions. It is rather an organization
of these things. It is the form of things that people have in mind,
their models for perceiving, relating, and otherwise interpreting
them. (p. 167)
This implies some elements of cultural homogenization
such as perceiving, relating, and interpreting. These key-
words seek to show the similarities among culture and then
to amalgamate the intended culture, which is quietly ponder-
able for the target bystanders. Keesing (1974) sees culture as
epistemologically in the same realm as language such as
Saussure's Langue or Chomsky's Competence. Therefore, it
can be stated that language is the subcategory of culture in
that it expatiates human interactions, behaviors, rites, and
creeds through threads of words. In this sense, to transmit the
near meaning of the words, componential analysis (CA) will
be an asset. In CA, the rationale behind the words will be
revealed and the translator is able to conglomerate the SL to
the target one.
Symbolic culture. Culture in this sense can be treated as sym-
bols and meaning. Culture as a symbolic system has been
under investigation since 1957. It is worth noting that the two
precursors in this junta are Clifford Geertz and David
Schneider.
Geertz sees culture systematically along with some well-
defined procedures in accordance with humanistic scholar-
ship.Hemadehisefforttoexpoundethnographicpeculiarities
to connect and then to corroborate the real nature of culture.
Therefore, he figures out these peculiarities in real people
accompanied by real rites, customs, behaviors, and creeds. In
this direction, he scrutinized the term culture under the semi-
otic field, which deals with signs and symbols in every cul-
ture. That is why he termed culture as "an assemblage of
text" (Geertz, 1957, p. 26). Geertz is the opponent of integra-
tion and internal consistency of culture in that he explains
only partial integration and often disconnectedness and inter-
nal contradiction exist (Katan, 1999). Therefore, Geertz
(1964) makes one original metaphor, which states,
The problem of cultural analysis is as much a matter of
determining independencies as interconnection, gulfs as well as
bridges. The appropriate image, if one must have images, of
cultural organization, is neither the spider web nor the pile of
sand. It is rather more the octopus, whose tentacles are in large
part separately integrated, neutrally quite poorly connected with
one another and with what in the octopus passes for a brain, and
yet who nonetheless manages to get around and to preserve
himself, for a while anyway, as a viable, if somewhat ungainly
entity. (pp. 66-67)
Another pioneer in culture as a symbol is Schneider work-
ing on the Parsonian framework. The Parsonian framework
scrutinizes the social system in culture by its direction toward
the achievement of specific goals. The Parsonian framework
in culture is explicit, comprehensive, and applicable in dif-
ferent layers of culture. The Parsonian model works on
Adaptation, Goal Attainment, Integration, and Latency
(AGIL), in that it peruses why communities are fixed/stable
and functioning. According to Schneider (1972), culture is
the systems of meaning and symbols. Symbols and meanings
inspect the units and rules in behavior of the society to see
the similarities and discrepancies among the intended fac-
tors. Therefore, Schneider extended the paradigm of culture
as "how-to-do-it" rules and norms/conventions, and then he
explains the navigation of the social world in this essence.
Schneider (1972) peruses symbols and meanings in his
models:
By symbols and meaning I mean the basic premises which a
culture posits for life: what its units consist in; how those units
Akbari and Shahnazari 5
are defined and differentiated; how they form an integrated
order or classification; how the world is structured; in what parts
it consists and on what premises it is conceived to exist, the
categories and classifications of the various domains of the
world of man and how they relate one with another, and the
world that man sees himself living in. (p. 38)
To cut the long story short, Schneider made his efforts in
the social system, particularly kinship, politics, and econom-
ics and pure cultural analysis. He then addressed pure cul-
tural analysis as "uncontaminated by the study of its social
systems" (p. 38). In this connection, he also sought to con-
nect culture, society, and psychological plans to perceive the
social and standard life of people. And it is better to say that
the renderer should put himself or herself in the other's shoes
particularly social life, standard of living, creeds, behaviors,
and the beliefs of people, so as to admix the two isolated
poles (source and target cultures) in translation studies and
attract the decoding ability in his or her action.
The Translator as Mediator
In translation studies, the renderer, translator, and interpreter
act like the mediator who wants to reconcile the source cul-
ture to the target one. According to George Steiner (1975),
"The translator is a bilingual mediating agent between mono-
lingual communication participants in two different language
communities" (p. 45). This definition and the like are not
new in translation studies. The translator as a mediator or
"The Cultural Mediator" (Bochner, 1981) consists of two
terms that make lots of discrepancies in translation in that the
translator can mix all the traits of source and target cultures
into the fixed and stable paradigm. Taft (1981) defines cul-
tural mediator as follows:
The person who facilitates communication, understanding, and
action between persons or groups who differ with respect to
language and culture. The role of the mediator is performed by
interpreting the expression, intentions, perceptions, and
expectations of each cultural group to the other that is by
establishing and balancing the communication between them. In
order to serve as a link in this sense, the mediator must be able
to participate to some extent in both cultures. Thus a mediator
must be to a certain extent bi-cultural. (p. 53)
It is clear that the main task of the translator is to attune
the SL to the TL. Understanding of culture means homogeni-
zation of culture. Homogenization of culture causes people
to interact well, and they can communicate with each other.
Diminishing some aspects of culture in both SL and TL will
be of great importance to depict the stable framework in
homogenization of culture. Therefore, Taft (1981) argued
that the mediator should have some traits such as (a) knowl-
edge about society: history, folklore, traditions, customs, val-
ues, prohibitions; the natural environment and its importance;
neighboring people, important people in the society, and so
on; (b) communication skills: written, spoken, and non-ver-
bal; (c) technical skills: those acquired by the mediator's sta-
tus, for example, computer literacy, appropriate dress, and so
on; and (d) social skills: knowledge of the rules that govern
social relations in society and emotional competence such as
the appropriate level of self-control. Therefore, the translator
should make his or her efforts to find some common ground
among culture, so as to make translation universal and sub-
ject to uniformity.
Discussion
Culture paradigm both homogenized and diversified is so
vast that no one can fully explain about the real nature of
culture in every field such as translation studies, socio-cul-
tural studies, and so forth. In this connection, culture is
defined variously by everyone and in most of the cases; one
cannot thoroughly rely on the nature of culture's definitions.
In the definition of cultural diversification, some shortcom-
ings can be observed in that it is worth noticing to express
and then make the stable and uniform culture paradigm par-
ticularly in translation studies. Unfortunately, there do not
exist real criticisms on culture paradigm in translation.
Therefore, preparing the real and clear criticisms will be of
great importance to corroborate the nature of culture in trans-
lation studies. This article seeks to express the updated short-
comings of the previous definitions of culture, and then the
researcher intends to propose a more comprehensive model
of cultural homogenization known as HomoKult Model of
Translation in NTS.
As described in the previous section, most cultural defini-
tions utilize the wrong metaphorical meanings. A good defi-
nition should consider all aspects of the culture to convince
and persuade the reader. For instance, the Iceberg Theory of
culture simulates culture as a huge iceberg, in that it has two
parts. One of the parts is beneath the water, which is called
the non-observable culture, and the other part is on the sur-
face, and it is called observable culture. This kind of defini-
tion is completely true of cultural diversification, in that all
people behave differentially according to their language pat-
terns and language sensitivities. But one has to ruminate that
the physical shape of the iceberg is prone to annihilating and
melting. In this kind of situation, the iceberg should not be
considered as observable culture. Therefore, clarifying exact
nature of culture requires considering every aspect of culture
both physically and mentally. So, the translator cannot fully
rely on Iceberg Theory in his or her translation.
Nowadays, most of the translators seek to find new ways
to connect the cultures to render exactly, and they seek to
ruminate on cultural homogenization. Therefore, combining
the SL culture to TL culture in translation will be of great
importance. The translators should ponder on the deep layer
of the cultures, and then they should pay attention to the con-
veying phase-transfer-in translation. It is completely natural
to say that all cultures share some common parts together in
6 SAGE Open
that they make translation understandable for all ilks of tar-
get people. For instance, the terms Norouz--New Year Eve
in Iran--and Christmas in Western countries share some
commonalities such as moving the earth, changing the
weather, and changing people's thought to start the new
beginning. These factors show a deep layer of culture, and
the translator has to transmit this kind of situation in his or
her translation, so as to persuade the reader. But the impor-
tant factor is that cultures will show some differences in their
surface level. Surface-level translation in translation studies
is just scrutinized for the people's way of thinking. They
show the observable facts of the people. Therefore, the trans-
lator should first translate the shared points, and after that, he
or she devotes his or her time on differences.
The other note is that in cultural studies (CS), the transla-
tor usually inclines to the surface layer of the culture, which
is completely wrong. Translator as the mediator should make
the equilibrium side in translation. It means that both deep
layer and surface layer in translation should be taken into
account and treated similarly. For instance, the road between
translation polarities will be treated as source­target amalga-
mation, and it is thoroughly utilizable in cultural homogeni-
zation known as HomoKult Model of Translation. Therefore,
admixing the two poles in translation is highly acceptable to
convince the reader.
HomoKult Model of Translation
To expound every culture, one must make the broader and
accurate paradigm to corroborate every incoming and
outcoming(consequence) factor in CS. CS deals with all
issues that depict human background. Therefore, it is sug-
gested that one must depict an accurate paradigm in CS in
order not to insult any culture in this direction. It is tried to
respect every culture and scrutinize most of the aspects of
culture so as to create the stable cultural paradigm in transla-
tion and make translation homogenize which saturates every
various tastes in this regard. The reason to opt for the term
HomoKult is the prefix and partial wafting (Akbari, 2013),
which is completely ruminatable in translation studies as cul-
tural homogenization. According to Dictionary reference
(2014), homo- as the Greek prefix combines from homós,
one and the same, akin to Sanskrit Sama, which is completely
ponderable in that it is utilized in this above-mentioned
model. The prefix homo- is well upgraded, and approxi-
mately most of the languages utilize it in their texts. The
other note is about the word Kult, which is derived from the
real and exact word in the German language Das Kulture.
German language is one of the leading languages that jot
down every noun with capital letter, and it seeks to show the
power of the above-mentioned language among others.
Homo- plus Kult show cultural amalgamation in translation
aiming at depicting no borderline in translation studies. In
translation studies, no red lines should be defined, and all the
problems in translation studies are derived from the
viewpoint of the translator. The translator as the mediator is
able to connect the source and the target text fully, which is
called source­target reconciliation in HomoKult Model.
However, when the translator peruses the discrepancies and
differences between the source and the TL cultures, she or he
is dealing with source­target dispersion. The former seeks to
connect the prior knowledge of the translator to that of the
new one and then determine the common ground. For
instance, compliments in each language play semantic voids
in translation. Should the renderer pay attention to the deep
layer of the compliment in the SL, he or she can fully restruc-
ture the same situation into the target one. Therefore, it
should be stated that the role of the translator is greater than
those of the source and target texts. The latter case is due to
the fact that the translator discriminates some of the exclu-
sive rules either in the TL or in the SL. The translator acts
like the annihilator who seeks to destroy the nature of the text
in accordance with his or her taste and does not consider the
role of the reader in translation. The latter case is specialized
in deconstructionism, who believes authorless text and the
death of the author (Pym, 2010). Therefore, the translator
should make some checklists before the act of translating to
translate correctly, and then he or she meets the needs of the
reader in this connection. This checklist might be the deter-
mination of unit of translation. Unit of translation can be
defined as "the linguistic level at which ST is recodified in
TL" (Shuttleworth and Cowie, 1997, p. 192). Therefore, the
translator should determine his or her scope in translation in
that he or she should actuate the exact unit of translation. For
instance, Vinay and Darbelnet (1958/1995, pp. 20-27) deter-
mine their unit of translation as "unit of thought," or Catford
(1965, p. 76) defines his unit of translation as "phoneme,"
which carries the meaning of the utterance. However, these
kinds of borders in unit of translation will not be very precise
unless the translator considers all aspects of contextual fac-
tors in translation. Unit of translation should be beyond the
discourse in the text. That is due to the fact that every word
has the rationale behind it, and it is obligatory for the ren-
derer to transmit this rationality in this regard. Therefore,
HomoKult Model of translation actuates culture as the unit
of translation. Culture consists of words, phrases, clauses,
paragraphs, and discourse, and it seeks to peruse the work-
ability of the intended factors in translation to make the
Translation Universal (TU).
For the ease of the reader, HomoKult Model will be
divided into four subcategories, which start from general to
specific issues (top­down analysis). These four subcatego-
ries are as follows:
Purposive culture. Purposive culture is defined as any kind of
rudimental culture scrutinized deeply in order to convey go
togetherness and then amalgamates deep layer of culture to
those of the others. Purposive culture seems like the founda-
tion of the building to establish a well-balanced structure
sense for the other parts. Purposive culture peruses
Akbari and Shahnazari 7
conceptual items either in the SL or in the TL rudimentally. It
is the lowest part but pivotal in cultural paradigm. Should the
intended culture declare its priority over the other ones, it
will devastate its nature and is not able to corroborate itself
as to be stable in purposive culture.
Purposive culture consists of underlying aspects of cul-
ture, which is of great importance in transmitting the real and
exact essence of the words, sentences, texts, and ideologies.
These aspects are norms, conventions, values, perceptions,
understandings, creeds, and so forth. In the case of rendering
such aspects, the translator/renderer should pay attention to
the deep layer of these items. For instance, Io sono il tuo
sacrifico will be rendered as I am your sacrifice to show the
deep value of the intended item in translation. It shows the
hidden and underlying respect, which is completely agree-
able in all cultures and languages. But the most important
factor is to convey the real sense correctly without any exag-
geration. Therefore, the role of the translator in this category
is of great importance in that the translator is going to pre-
pare the text to move to the next step. As another example,
for making a polite request, one has to do with Excuse me,
Entschuldigen Sie, or Scusi, in that they show the common
deep ground in culture dealing with conventions or the norms
of the society that are completely unanimous in every cul-
ture. In these contexts, the translator should first transmit the
common sense behind the intended polite words through the
techniques of reader attention, magnifying, eschewing dis-
preferred structure, and diminishing imposition (Akbari,
2014b ). Thus, he or she is able to embellish the surface
structures of such polite request. In this direction, translator
considers all ilks of people such as average illiterate, illiter-
ate, and the specialists. Therefore, culture translation needs
to investigate the underlying structure of the cultures and
then prepare it for conveyance. Translation is not the matter
of naturalizing, alienating, foreignizing, domesticating, and
communicating. Translation is beyond these scopes.
Translation is the conveyance of the hidden words of the cul-
ture. Translation or interpretation is not in the place of 0% or
100%. In some situations, translation will be in between. In
some cases, the translator has to do with the lower incoming
or low incidences of translational items in the culture.
Therefore, he or she just pays attention to the source­target
amalgamation to make an acceptable translation. But the
problem is that translation puts itself in a gray zone with
more inclination to higher incoming or high incidences of
translational items in the culture. In most cases, the translator
should first recognize the underlying sense of the source text
such as norms, conventions, values (purposive culture), and
then he or she should build a common connection between
the two poles so as to remove any impossibility. Impossibility
arises when the translator renders in accord with his or her
taste/passion and does not seek to carry out the suitable and
appropriate interpretation of the text. This situation puts him
or her into mistranslation, in that some far-fetched concepts
will be derived from the intended text. In this situation, the
translator is the author of the target text, and it is better to
label such issue as "Transcreation." Translation should be
regarded as an art that makes the impossible possible.
Therefore, prior to the act of translating, the renderer is better
to build up simulation (homogenization) in the TL so as to
make the rendition more tangible and understandable.
To clarify the real essence of purposive culture in
HomoKult Model, it is beneficial to make use of the intended
case study:
Case Study I: The Spread of Chinese
Culture
Japan's location close to China brought many aspects of
Chinese culture to Japan. For example, Japan's rulers claimed
to be absolute emperor, like those of China. Buddhism and
Confucianism also came from China and interacted with
Japanese beliefs to create new values and beliefs.
Confucianism taught loyalty to the ruler, while Buddhism
taught the Japanese to reject the selfish desires. Japan also
adapted Chinese characters to create their own written lan-
guage. Chinese music, art, pottery, weaving, and cooking
further influenced Japanese styles and tastes. (http://www.
binghamsplace.com/uploads)
This case study implies that one has to understand that the
Chinese culture plays as a purposive culture in that it distrib-
utes the fundamental parts of its own culture to the other cul-
tures. It is not the way of modifying other cultures. However,
it aims at enriching other cultures. In this connection, Chinese
culture is regarded as mother culture, and other ones as
adapted cultures. In translation, translator as a powerful
mediator should seek to construct the fundamental situation
by identifying the inner parts of cultures so as to create an
eternal translation. According to the intended case study,
translator can enumerate Chinese culture as the mother cul-
ture in his or her translation. It signifies that the deep layer of
Chinese and Japanese cultures is the same and, progressively,
they are spreading to the Western countries to show their
homogeneity throughout the world.
Finally, it can be stated that purposive culture deals with
void areas in translation which are completely invisible.
Invisibility in the underlying structure of the culture needs to
help decipher some clear and exact areas to simulate the void
areas in the TL. Void and ambiguous areas should not be con-
veyed during the process of translation, in that they make
translation superficial and commercial. Therefore, conglom-
erating the unclear spots in translation to those of clear areas
puts the translation in the gray area, which is completely
common in appropriate renderings.
Ameliorated culture.Ameliorated culture is defined as any
sort of culture works on the superficial layer of culture. Ame-
liorated culture inspects the workability of the surface layer
8 SAGE Open
of culture and then connects the second angles of HomoKult's
web to see the common grounds with those of other angles.
Ameliorated culture is seen as the decorator among other
HomoKult's categories in that it pays special attention to the
surface level of culture to inspect the degree of similarities
and differences. To do so, one has to answer these kinds of
questions. How can the renderer reflect ameliorated culture
in his or her translation? And how can he or she approximate
to the source­target amalgamation in this process? To answer
such questions, the process of translation should appellate
the reader to connect himself or herself to the various layers
of the culture. It means that translation plays an appellative
function in the SL and TL. In this connection, Bartoli (1981)
argued,
di persuasione alla conformita e di interiorizzazione di modelli
culturali che la classe o i gruppi al potere ritengono necessari per
i mantenimento dell'equilibrio del sistema sociale e che, in
particolare nelle societa fortemente stratificate, determinati altri
gruppi o classi sociali pongono al centro di una strategia di
organizzazione del consenso attorno ai propri obiettivi e attorno
alle proprie definizioni della realta. (p. 4)
(Gloss): Of persuasion to conformity and of internalization of
the cultural models (patterns) that the dominating classes or
groups deem necessary for maintaining the equilibrium of the
social system and which, especially in highly stratified societies,
certain other groups or social classes put in the center of a
strategy of organizing the consensus about the appropriate
objectives and the appropriate definitions of reality.
The ameliorated culture seeks to investigate issues such
as type of dancing, food, music, art, architecture, beverages,
and so forth. It can be stated that the intended culture is pro-
gressive in nature. It will become complete through the time,
and it is diachronically operationalized. For example, render-
ing Taglitelle ai porcini--an Italian food--as "Mushroom
Stew" in the English language is superficially homogenized
in that the English reader can understand the real nature of
the intended food through the time. Or Porcellana in the
Italian language becomes ameliorated and turns into
"Porcelain" in the English language. In translation studies,
ameliorated culture covers physical norms in which it scruti-
nizes the acceptability judgment of the source and the TL to
depict the uniform framework between the two poles.
Simulation of the SL culture into the target one is of great
importance in this category. For example, transferring of the
SL cuisine recipe into the target one requires simulating the
intended cuisine system in the TL, so as to become homog-
enized for the target reader in essence. In this direction, the
translator can replace the approximate food in the target cul-
ture, so as to create the same situation for the reader to under-
stand the taste. Connecting the SL to the TL in ameliorated
culture requires the sufficient knowledge in equivalence
paradigm. Equivalence paradigm, in most of the cases, deals
with superficiality of the rendering to saturate the needs of
the reader. But the important factor in NTS will be to per-
suade the reader to know the vastness of translation.
Therefore, the translator has to concentrate on the deep layer
of culture first. Every text has the rationale in which it needs
to be ruminated. This rationale is called culture. This is due
to the fact that most of the renditions seem to be artificial
rudimentally, and the reader cannot connect himself or her-
self to the text. In the field of translation, the translator should
first render the culture for his or her own taste. Should he or
she be able to connect to the rendering, he or she can publi-
cize the intended rendering. In this regard, Hoffman (1998)
argues,
I have to translate myself. But if I'm to achieve this without
becoming assimilated--that is, absorbed--by my new world,
the translation has to be careful, the turn of the psyche unforced.
To mouth foreign term without incorporating their meaning is to
risk becoming bowdlerized. A true translation proceeds by the
motions of understanding and sympathy; it happens by slow
increments, sentence by sentence, phrase by phrase. (p. 211).
Whenever the translator has to concentrate on the under-
standing and sympathy of the translation, she or he is dealing
with surface structure of the translation, and they are tied by
ameliorated culture to see the differences and similarities in
the SL and TL. For instance, Das Frittenporzellen in the
German language has to be rendered as "Frit" in English. In
this situation, the translator resorts to the process of Wafting
Procedure (Akbari, 2013, 2014a ), so as to create the same
equivalent situation/effect in the TL culture. Wafting is
defined as follows:
A direct and intense translation process, it has a connection with
render or even transfer as the original SL by inserting or
absorbing the SL words or phrase form into the RL's in
accordance to prestigious, frequency and intensity of the
intended word. (p. 27)
In the other fields such as music, ameliorated culture will
be worth noticing. For instance, the term pop songs was
derived from the "popular songs," in that people are willing
to listen. This term enters other cultures as "pop" without any
alternation. That is due to its homogeneity and prevalence of
the intended style of music. To substantiate the nature of
music in community and other fields as translation studies,
Connell and Gibson (2003) have noted,
Music does not exist in a vacuum. Geographical space is not an
empty stage on which aesthetic, economic and cultural battles
are contested. Rather, music and space are actively and
dialectically related. Music shapes spaces, and spaces shape
music. (p. 192)
From the above-mentioned definition, one can conclude that
dialect alludes to the culture of either the source or the target
one, and types of music are pertained to the culture.
Akbari and Shahnazari 9
Therefore, the translator should interpret the intended culture
and make this culture more tangible for the reader and then
introduces the kinds of clothes, music, dances, and so forth.
Case Study II: The Columbian
Exchange
European and Native American cultures encountered each
other for the first time in 1492. This encounter, referred to as
the Columbian Exchange, led to the introduction of new
products to both cultures. European brought horses, goats,
cattle, pigs, chicken, wheat, and goods like cannons, cross-
bows and steel to the Americas. At the same time, Native
Americans had developed many foods unknown to European.
An important result of the encounter was that the European
diet was greatly improved by the introduction of new foods
such as tomatoes, chocolate, potatoes, beans, peppers, pump-
kins, squash, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and corn. European
also learned how to smoke tobacco. (http://www.binghams-
place.com/uploads)
In such cases, the best and drastic way to convey and
transfer the main essence of the original text is to simulate
the similar situation with the same equal value into the recep-
tor language. For instance, potato first appeared in Columbian
language, and consequently every language started making
the exact equivalent of the intended term. French utilized the
term pomme de terre, in that it means an apple growing from
the ground. Consequently, Persian language stimulated the
intended term Sibe Zamini to substantiate the same semantic
component of "potato." This transference shows that cultures
are becoming approximate with each other. It is noteworthy
that the translator as a mediator should observe the local
color of the original and its stimulated term in the TL so as to
put translation in middle ground between SL and TL. As
another example, the local clothes of Japanese people are
called Kimono. How can the translator render such term into
Persian language? How is it possible to stimulate such situa-
tion into the TL so as to convince the reader on its feasibility?
In this situation, the Persian translator exploits the similar
term Rasuxi (local garment of north of Iran) in that it conveys
the same deep layer of meaning. However, the only differ-
ence is in the way of its dressing. Needless to say, creating
and constructing the same effect and situation will be highly
recommendable.
Finally, it should be noted that the translator has to con-
centrate on equivalent potentials. Equivalent potentials
allude to the potency of the words to approximately homog-
enize in the TL. Translators as the mediators are responsible
for making and creating the same effect on the target reader
so as to saturate their needs both deeply and superficially.
There are other factors that are mostly important in cultural
translation such as language sensitivity, language resistance,
and SL­TL amalgamation, which play the key role in NTS.
Circulated culture. The third category in HomoKult Model of
translation is circulated culture, which is defined as pro-
cesses of temporal and spatial alternations in technologies,
products, values, beliefs, and cultural characteristics from
one place, state, and country to another. Circulated culture in
translation will be regarded as the peripheral circumstance
that subjects to alter and change. For instance, American cul-
ture spreads into most of the country especially Asian coun-
tries, which are on the verge of developing. Most of the
changes are pertained to technologies, Western ideas as a
way of clothing, dressing, eating, and behaving. The world
turns to be multicultural, and it causes to approximate every
culture together to decipher the points of similarities in this
direction. Cultural approximation will influence the tradi-
tional culture and beliefs. Everything is being progressed,
and one has to make his or her life updated in accordance
with these upgraded regulations. As another example, demo-
cratic notions are prevalent in many countries. Democratic
notions first emanate from the 1980s and 1990s, which affect
the military dictatorships in some countries. Circulated cul-
ture consists of many contemporary factors in the entire
world. But the question might be, "To what extent does this
kind of culture lasts?" Or "Do people get along well with
these changes?"
To clarify the whole idea of circulated culture, it is better
to expound one case study so as to persuade the reader on
making the stable paradigm in this regard.
Case Study III: The Global Reach of
American Popular Culture
American culture is the product of many influences, includ-
ing those from Native American, English, French, Spanish,
African, Asian, and other countries. In the early 20th century,
a vibrant American Culture emerged with the new technolo-
gies, like the radio, record player, moving picture, and televi-
sion. After the World War II, American popular music and
movies became popular in Europe and later spread to every
continent. Today people throughout the world see American
movies and television programs, dance to American "pop"
music, and use English as an international second language.
Many wear American casual dress styles, such as Tee shirts
with logos, and large number even eat at American fast food
franchises, like McDonald's and Taco Bell. American artists
like Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga are international icons,
known in almost every corner of the world. (see http://www.
binghamsplace.com)
According to this case study, one can conclude that circu-
lated culture is an indispensable part of human life that
becomes progressed through time. In this connection, should
the country seek to approximate to the cutting-edge rules, it
must be a member of circulated culture to see real-technolo-
gized culture.
10 SAGE Open
Circulated culture is an integral part in NTS. The transla-
tor plays an influential role in the source and target culture.
He or she should act as the plug who wants to make the con-
nection. Nowadays, some new terms along with new cultural
traits come into the language showing the progressive nature
in every country. In this situation, the task of translator is to
homogenize the new terms in the TL, so as to introduce the
progression and globalization. It is generally believed that
most of the ilks of people in every country get accustomed to
the new technological areas, and they are really eager to
know the function of the new terms in this regard. Therefore,
translator should transfer the surface structure of the circu-
lated culture to prepare the situation for the target reader.
Because of its periphery, the translator/interpreter is not
required to bind themselves on the deep layer of culture in
this category. Translation is available by means of its persua-
sion in the receptive culture.
To support the idea of circulated culture, Danilo Zolo
(1997), in Cosmopolis: Prospect for World Government,
expressed the Western as the globalized era:
In fact goes no further than a network of connections and
functional interdependencies which have developed within
certain important sectors of the global market, above all finance,
technology, automation, manufacturing industry and the service
sector. Nor, moreover, does it go much beyond the optimistic
expectation of affluent westerns to be able to feel universally
recognized as citizen of the world--citizens of a welcoming,
peaceful, ordered, and democratic global village--without for a
moment or in any way ceasing to be `themselves', i.e. western
citizens. (p. 137)
Circulated culture also verifies the hierarchy of new cul-
ture but not the domination. It means that one of the new and
progressive cultures acts as the mother culture that supports
the others to make them progress. In NTS, one of the promi-
nent sources of culture will provide some insights for the
translator and the target reader. For instance, "iPad" and
"iPod" are leading technologies in Western countries that
affect many lives. Therefore, the translator should convey
the real culture of the intended words via the process of the
total wafting (Akbari, 2013) procedure in translation so as to
transmit the exact influence on people's lives.
Last but not least, circulated culture is pertained to the
outer layer of culture, and it is not surrounded by the deep
layer of culture. Sooner or later, some new elements in circu-
lated culture will replace the old ones. Therefore, it is better
to say that circulated culture is always progressing, and so is
ameliorated culture. The differences between the circulated
culture and the ameliorated one will be centered on their
periphery. The former is always subjected to change, and
after a while, some better elements will replace circulated
culture, and everything is in the position of being forgotten.
But the latter case might turn into the purposive culture and
lasts for a long time. Culture is relative, and the human being
cannot rely upon relativism. Everything should be in a stable
and uniform position. If the translator observes such factors
in his or her translation, it is better to say that his or her trans-
lation will be indelible in nature. Finally, the important note
is that the translator is the messenger of the culture not the
annihilator. Therefore, it is the duty of translator to prepare
the common grounds in translation thoroughly and not bind
himself or herself to the target level of language. The transla-
tor should be in between or the comparator in his or her ren-
derings to affect the process of the translation.
Diglossic culture. The fourth category of HomoKult Model
of translation is Diglossic culture. Generally speaking,
Diglossic culture is defined as any culture in a society that
consists of two related parts: (a) high variety of culture and
(b) low variety of culture. The former refers to a special
group of people such as elites, professors, families with
high-class position, and nobles. However, the latter alludes
to illiterate, average illiterate, laymen, and young genera-
tion. Some special groups of people seek to perform their
daily works in accordance with their families' back-
grounds, and they bind themselves to the new high-class
regulations. However, some ilks of people seek to build
and provide the simple life, and they are willing to com-
municate easily with each other without ordaining some
limitations in interaction. These sorts of groups mostly uti-
lize special vernaculars in their daily conversation. There-
fore, interacting with these two diverse sides is of great
importance for linguists, socio-linguists, and translators.
Of these groups, translators play the major role in reconcil-
ing these two different sides together. The translator should
ordain some rules and regulations dealing with them.
Translation in Diglossic culture might be sometimes
nationalized or internationalized--nationalized in some
cases that the renderer seeks to introduce and build the rap-
port chains among the people of the country in general. But
the important problem arises when the translator seeks to
introduce the Diglossic culture into international market.
How can the renderer persuade the target reader not to
endanger the source Diglossic culture in international soci-
eties? And how will it be possible to prepare the situation
to introduce the target low variety of culture in the recep-
tive-target-audience so as not to infer the inappropriate-
ness of the source culture?
In Diglossic culture, two translation techniques might be
used as persuasion in this essence. One is related to the nature
of natural equivalence, and the other is pertained to the direc-
tional equivalent. According to Nida and Taber (1969), natu-
ral equivalence is defined as "reproducing in the receptor
language the closest natural equivalent of the source lan-
guage message" (p. 12). Therefore, the translator should con-
sider natural equivalent in his or her renderings for particular
situations. Natural equivalent might be used for the illiterate
or average illiterate people. Persuasion of the target reader in
this category will not be an ordeal in that the target reader is
able to connect to the text without making much effort.
Akbari and Shahnazari 11
One of the leading factors in Diglossic culture and natural
equivalent is translation of poetry, which Roman Jacobson
(1959/2000) addressed as "creative transposition" (pp. 113-
118). Poetry plays an important role in human life. Therefore,
tangible translation of poetry is of great importance in trans-
lation studies. Prior to the act of translating, the translator
should consider the Diglossic nature of culture and the types
of decoding ability discussed before. Indelible translation
causes to carve its suitability in target reader's mind. For
example, Umberto Saba's poet known as All'animamia will
be appropriate in scrutinizations of natural equivalents for
average illiterate or illiterate people in a low variety of
Diglossic culture.
Dell'inesaustatuamiseriagodi
Tanto ti valga, anima mia, sapere;
Sì che il tuo male, null'altro, ti giovi.
O forseavventurantoè chi s'inganna?
Nè a se stessoscoprirsi ha in suo potere,
Nèmai la suasentenza lo condanna?
Magnanimasei pure, anima nostra;
Ma per quali non tuoicasit'esalti,
Sì che unbaciomentitoindi ti prostra.
A me la miamiseriaèunchiarogiorno,
D'estate, quand'ogniaspettodaglialti
Luoghidiscorpo in ogni suo contomo.
Nullam'èocculto; tuttoèsìvicino
Dove l'occhio o ilpensiero mi conduce.
Triste ma sollegiatoèilmiocammino;
E tutto in esso, finol'ombra, è in luce
The intended English translation of "Umberto Saba" by
Mike Towler (trans.1998 ) is as follows:
You delight in your unending misery
Such, my soul, should be the worth of knowledge,
That your suffering alone should do you good.
Or is the self-deceived the lucky one?
He who cannot ever know himself
Or the sentence of his condemnation?
Still, my soul, you are magnanimous;
Yet how you thrill to phantom opportunities,
And so are brought down by a faithless kiss.
To me my misery is a bright summer
Day, where from high up I can make out
Every facet, every detail of the world below.
Nothing is obscure to me; it's all right there;
Wherever my eye or my mind leads me.
My road is sad but brightened by the sun;
And everything on it, even shadow, is in light
In the above-mentioned translation, every element of the
Italian poem was replaced by its natural equivalent to per-
suade the reader. Feasibility and practicality in natural equiv-
alent are necessary so as to make the natural or one-to-one
correspondent translation. For instance, l'ombra is rendered
by "the shadow," which shows the formal situation of the
poem. The reason behind such translation stemmed from the
type of audience in this poem. It can be expressed that trans-
lation consists of various equivalents in the TL, but the
important factor is to satisfy your reader by the simple ren-
dering, particularly in a special ilk of people. The other
equivalents for the intended words are "afterimage," "adum-
bration," and "apparition," which carry connotational mean-
ings of the word "shadow," in that the renderer cannot utilize
it in a low variety of Diglossic culture.
However, directional equivalence refers to "the replace-
ment of textual materials in one language (SL) by equivalent
material in another language (TL)" (Catford, 1965, p. 20).
Directional equivalence is utilized for the high variety of
Diglossic culture, in that it scrutinizes the connotational
meanings and trends of the translation. It is one-to-two cor-
respondents in that one element in the SL covers two or more
elements in the TL. Therefore, this kind of equivalent
requires having special audiences in this regard. Most of the
readers in this category consist of professors, teachers, phi-
losophers, and so forth. Persuasion and saturation the needs
of this category will be an arduous task in that the translation
should cover every aspect of translation so as to connect the
real and exact sense of the source text. For instance, "Chaos"
by Gerard Nolst Trenitè (1992, http://ncf.idallen.com/eng-
lish.html ) will be inspected in this category. To clarify the
nature of high variety in Diglossic culture and directional
equivalent, it is better to peruse some parts of this poem:
Arch, archangel; pray, does erring
Rhyme with herring or with stirring?
Prison, bison, treasure trove,
Treason, hover, cover, cove,
Perseverance, severance, ribald
Rhyme, (but piebald doesn't) with nibbled
Phaeton, paean, gnat, ghat, gnaw,
Lien, psychic, shone, bone, pshaw.
Don't be down, my own, but rough it,
And distinguish buffet, buffet;
Brood, stood, roof, rook, school, wool, boon,
Worcester, Boleyn, to impugn.
Say in sounds correct and sterling
Hearse, hear, hearken, year, and yearling.
Evil, devil, mezzotint,
Mind the Z! (A gentle hint)
In this poem, the translator encounters much trouble in
that he or she should consider, first, the purposive culture of
the source text into the TL context. Second, he or she should
bridge the connection among the unconnected words in this
poem to build the stable and well-balanced framework.
Third, the translator should observe the rhyme and musical
intonation of the poem, and finally, he or she should consider
the particular bystanders in this poem. Every line of the
12 SAGE Open
poem covers a sea of discrepancies and similarities that are
not easily treated in translation. The apex duty of the transla-
tor is to simulate the real and exact situation for a high vari-
ety in Diglossic culture. These kinds of poems belong to the
special group of people in that they seek to impress the reader
by their delicacies, dulcetness, and connotational aspects of
semantic fields.
In the light of these explanations, natural and directional
equivalences will be of high importance, in that they are
perused to convince the reader about the vastness of culture.
In this connection, bridging the gap between the SL and its
counterpart will be highly recommendable in the NTS era.
Therefore, translation studies should cover all aspects of
translation and incline themselves to cultural approximation.
Cultural approximation (homogenization) causes people to
interact better, and it makes translation more tangible and
finally more perceivable.
Conclusion
To sum, cultural paradigm or CS in translation will be in an
unstable position, and one has to decipher a well-balanced
paradigm to persuade the TL reader. But the important factor
is how the translator can pave the way in CS and then recon-
cile this field to NTS. How will it be possible to approximate
cultures so as to convey the main and exact sense of the SL
context?
This article makes its effort to explain the characteristics
of cultural paradigm in translation and then categorizes cul-
ture into four exact subgroups so as to prepare the situation
for the translator to opt for the exact subgroup of HomoKult
Model of translation in his or her rendering. Therefore, per-
suasion of the reader by the exact choice is highly recom-
mendable in NTS. Four categories of HomoKult Model of
translation were determined as purposive culture, amelio-
rated culture, circulated culture, and Diglossic culture. The
intended categories are chronologically ordered at which
they remove any hierarchy of cultural domination in transla-
tion. Therefore, should the translator observe the above-
mentioned categories in his or her translation, the rendering
removes any suffering from untranslatability in this regard.
Untranslatability arises when the translator does not know
how to determine his or her scopes and aims. To remove any
vulnerable parts and inferences in NTS, the renderer should
determine his scope of scrutinizations. This scope includes
the unit of translation. Unit of translation causes the render-
ing to be more stable and equilibrium-sided, and the transla-
tor/interpreter can approximate to the target culture. In this
direction, culture is an asset in translation to make the pro-
cess of rendering possible. Culture causes the translation to
be treated as an indispensable part of people's lives. Every
successful translation aims at depicting cultural homogeniza-
tion in that it approximates the source reader to the target one
so as to create natural interaction. It is possible when source
and target cultures try to find and share their common
grounds, and ultimately, they seek to eliminate the barriers so
as to create the homogenized translation.
