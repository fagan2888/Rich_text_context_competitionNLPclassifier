Abstract
University scientists conducting research on topics of potential health concern often want to
partner with a range of actors, including government entities, non-governmental organiza-
tions, and private enterprises. Such partnerships can provide access to needed resources,
including funding. However, those who observe the results of such partnerships may judge
those results based on who is involved. This set of studies seeks to assess how people per-
ceive two hypothetical health science research collaborations. In doing so, it also tests the
utility of using procedural justice concepts to assess perceptions of research legitimacy as a
theoretical way to investigate conflict of interest perceptions. Findings show that including
an industry collaborator has clear negative repercussions for how people see a research
partnership and that these perceptions shape people's willingness to see the research as a
legitimate source of knowledge. Additional research aimed at further communicating proce-
dures that might mitigate the impact of industry collaboration is suggested.
Introduction
Industry is an increasingly important but controversial source of funding for scientific
research and development (R&D) in the United States. Whereas the federal government
funded roughly two-thirds of R&D in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s, this relationship is
now flipped so that private industry is now funding roughly two-thirds of U.S. R&D [1]. Fur-
ther, university scientists increasingly are participating in public-private partnerships with
industry, government service or regulatory agencies, and/or non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) to engage with stakeholders and secure more consistent research funding in the face
of budgetary constraints on governmental research funding [2­4].

funding for this project.
Competing interests: Norbert Kaminsky has
received research funding from the Dow Chemical
Company. This research is not directly related to
the current project. This does not alter our
adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data
and materials.
Nevertheless, public skepticism of industry-funded research (e.g., [5, 6]) might constrain the
efficacy and influence of its results. The tobacco industry's efforts to deny the detrimental pub-
lic-health effects of its products is a well-known example of activities that have raised public
awareness of the possibility that industry-funded science could be less than fully reliable [7].
More recently, publications about the safety testing of industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals
[8­12], as well as about anthropogenic climate change [13­15], may have further contributed to
public concerns about the legitimacy of science in which industry has played a role. On the
other hand, the simple solution of asking scientific researchers to eschew all industry funding
and research collaborations seems unfeasible and undesirable, as a significant amount of impor-
tant and scientifically sound research would not be performed--to the detriment of society [16].
The question of how researchers might benefit from available industry funding without
diminishing the real or perceived quality of their research suggests the potential for a multidis-
ciplinary research program that examines the procedures that might be used to protect
research. The current set of studies represents one piece of such a work program and is built
on the assumption that efforts to design procedures for protecting research should be
informed by information about the types of procedures and/or criteria that generate public
confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting research. More generally, the current set of studies
seeks to develop an initial understanding of how laypeople's perceptions of a scientific research
collaboration are influenced by concerns about conflicts of interest. As is discussed below, the
choice of research partners is conceptualized as a basic way to communicate to others that a
research team is concerned about taking multiple viewpoints into account and that no one set
of interests will dominate. Other procedures to limit conflict of interest (see the discussion sec-
tion) are also possible but an initial focus on research partners is meant to help establish a
foundation for future work.
Past scholarship suggests that procedural justice concepts from social psychology may offer
insights for assessing how laypeople perceive research partnerships, given that such collabora-
tions can be understood as processes that researchers use to control biases and consider alter-
native viewpoints. After reviewing existing work in this area, we identify selected research
questions and derive key hypotheses from procedural justice scholarship. Specifically, we are
interested in how different collaborations (i.e., processes) can affect perceptions that research
will be done appropriately (i.e., procedural fairness) and the degree to which such perceptions
may also shape overall perceptions of the research (i.e., perceived legitimacy). We then discuss
our research protocols and present the results from three experiments designed to examine
how the inclusion of different partners in a health-related research collaboration influences the
perceived procedural fairness and perceived legitimacy of the resulting research. In each exper-
iment, subjects considered a hypothetical research collaboration studying the health effects of
transfats in foods (Studies 1 and 3) or the health effects of genetically modified (GM) food
(Study 2) that included an agrifood business, a research university, a government agency, and/
or an NGO. In our conclusion, we outline a further research agenda for investigating the
extent to which certain safeguards designed to reduce conflicts of interest may facilitate the
production of high-quality industry-funded research that laypeople perceive as legitimate. In
our current set of three studies, we focus on perceptions of conflict of interest and do not
make specific claims about the degree to which procedures such as partnership arrangements
are actually effective at limiting the effects of conflicted interests.
Existing scholarship
Given the paucity of theoretically driven work in this area, our project conceptualizes collabo-
ration as a conflict of interest mitigation procedure. It does so to build upon and extend a

study that employs well-established procedural justice scholarship (e.g., [17]) to examine per-
ceived conflict of interest in science [18]. Analyzing data from a cross-sectional survey of peo-
ple who attended Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory meetings, McComas, et al.
[18] find that attendees' fairness perceptions were associated both with satisfaction with the
committee process and willingness to accept the outcomes from the process (i.e., perceived
legitimacy). Our project builds upon that study, as well as the broader procedural justice litera-
ture, by using experimental procedures to examine how the inclusion of different partners
affects procedural fairness perceptions and, ultimately, willingness to use the research as a
legitimate basis for personal or public decision-making.
Defining conflict of interest
Most scholarship characterizes a conflict of interest as a situation in which an individual or
organization has a decision-making role that might allow them to improperly benefit from the
decisions they might make. This benefit could be financial, but it also could be personal (i.e.,
helping a friend) or a combination of the two (i.e., helping a work colleague). A benefit also
might include avoidance of harm. Importantly, the existence of a conflict of interest does not
require any specific behavior to occur. A conflict of interest is only the potential or tendency
for biased behavior to occur (for a longer discussion, see: [19, 20, 21]). A relatively recent U.S.
Institute of Medicine (IOM) report similarly defines conflicts of interest as "circumstances
that create a risk that professional judgments or actions regarding a primary interest will be
unduly influenced by a secondary interest" ([22] p. 6). Primary interests here include issues
such as the protection of research integrity, students, and patients, while secondary interests
include personal and professional concerns.
Most academic writing about conflicts of interest focuses on issues of disclosure. For exam-
ple, leading medical journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Association ([e.g.,
[23, 24­26]) and the New England Journal of Medicine (e.g., [27, 28]) feature numerous articles
reviewing existing disclosure policies and their impacts. Commentaries also suggest potential
issues and recommend policy changes (e.g., [29, 30­32]). Such recommendations are indeed a
central part of the IOM report cited above [22]. Although disclosure policies are clearly impor-
tant, they are not a panacea [33]; indeed, some research demonstrates that disclosure policies
may decrease the quality of advice that experts provide [34, 35]. Less common are studies on
the origins and impact of conflict of interest perceptions.
Experimental research on conflict of interest
As expected, the scant available scholarship suggests that conflict of interest perceptions have
negative impacts on how people view research. A 2010 systematic review identifies 20 relevant
peer-reviewed journal articles focused on perceptions of `financial ties' in the context of health
and medicine [36]. Most studies find that, when asked directly, research participants report
worrying about the impact of such conflicts and wanting to know about such conflicts. More
important for our project, the limited experimental research reviewed finds that disclosure
(versus non-disclosure) of industry funding decreases perceived research quality [37, 38] and
decreases trust in the researchers [39]. More recent research confirms such effects [40]. Fur-
ther, increasing the relative size of potential financial conflicts decreases trust perceptions [41].
Nevertheless, medical research participants do not appear to be substantially less likely to
enroll in clinical trials in the face of conflicts of interest [36, 42].
These earlier experimental studies typically ask subjects to review a research product (e.g., a
paper) written by authors either in an industry or an academic position. Our project is novel
since we more closely approximate the current reality of research funding and partnerships.

Briefly, in our three experiments we randomly assign subjects to one of 15 different combina-
tions of research partners--rather than simply ask subjects to consider a simple study or single
research outcome.
Procedural fairness and the study of conflict of interest
We further bolster the novelty of our project by integrating insights from theory associated
with procedural justice scholarship into the study of conflict of interest in science. Research in
this area consistently shows that people often perceive decisions as legitimate--even if the per-
son feels the decision may go against their interests--if they believe that such decisions result
from fair procedures (i.e., ones that allow stakeholders to have a voice and are free from biases
that might arise from conflicts of interest) employed by decision-makers who are seen as inter-
personally fair (i.e., actors who are respectful) [43, 44]. Indeed, this focus on the effects of `pro-
cedural' rather than `distributive' forms of fairness has emerged from a critique of a rational
choice approach to decision-making assuming that people only care about outcomes [45].
The three studies reported below conceptualize research involving potential risks as a `deci-
sion' about which an observer (e.g., someone who is trying to decide about whether to consider
new evidence) might make legitimacy judgments. The work further views the choice of
research partners as a conflict of interest mitigation process that researchers can use to, at least
partly, make the decision process more procedurally fair. The logic of considering collabora-
tion as a conflict of interest mitigation process is similar to why one might want to include rep-
resentatives from different parts of an organization when making decisions about major
hiring. Likewise, the logic underlies why a political leader might want to build a coalition that
includes different constituencies in a cabinet. The expectation is that having multiple voices
participate is likely to limit the effect of any one voice.
The adaption of procedural justice concepts seems important for the current set of studies
because past research on conflict of interest does not feature theory prominently (e.g.,[36]).
Building on past procedural justice theory can both provide a framework for measurement
and analyses in the current work as well as suggest additional areas of future research. As
noted above, McComas and her colleagues [18] apply procedural justice theory and find that
the degree to which attendees saw FDA advisory committees as following fair procedures was
associated with overall satisfaction and willingness to accept committee decisions. However,
whereas this earlier study examines perceptions of an existing process, the current work seeks
to identify processes that researchers might use to mitigate perceptions of bias.
Although not tested here, two related mechanisms likely underlie the impact of fairness per-
ceptions [46]. The most prominent is that people use procedural fairness as a heuristic to assess
an outcome when they are unsure about what would constitute a correct outcome [47, 48]. This
argument is consistent with findings that fair processes have little impact on those who see a
decision as morally mandated--and thus not uncertain (e.g., [49]). Second, other scholarship
posits that fair processes and fair treatment matter because they communicate to those affected
by a decision that they are valued members of a social identity group. Research supporting this
assertion shows that fair process perceptions have a greater impact within groups than between
groups [50, 51]. These underlying mechanisms suggest that a person might use information
about the partners in a research collaboration to make heuristic sense of a scientific study for
which she or he may not have the time or ability to assess based its scientific merits. As such, we
assume that our experimental subjects are using partnership information as a heuristic cue to
help make sense of the likely fairness of the partnership to which they are randomly assigned.
Although much fairness research centers on workplace settings, scholars also consider
activities in legal (e.g., [45, 52, 53]) and political (e.g., [54, 55, 56]) contexts. Of particular

relevance here is recent research that adapts the study of fairness to public perceptions of sci-
entific topics involving perceived health and environmental risk [57­62].
The current research
We perform three experimental studies to examine how different combinations of partners in
a research collaboration influence subjects' perceived procedural fairness and perceived legiti-
macy for that collaborative partnership. Although it is possible to imagine a range of ways to
characterize a research partnership, we focus here on what we think is the most basic informa-
tion about a partnership that might be communicated to create or alleviate concerns about
conflict of interest: who is performing the research.
First, procedural justice scholarship and past research on conflict of interest suggests that a
collaboration with industry or supported by industry funding will be seen as less fair and,
through fairness, less legitimate. We formally state this as a two-part hypothesis describing
fairness perceptions as a mediator.
Including an industry partner in a research collaboration (Hypothesis1a) directly reduces
perceived fairness and (H1b) indirectly reduces perceived legitimacy.
It is less clear, however, how including other partners will influence fairness and legitimacy
perceptions. As mentioned earlier, we consider three additional types of collaborators--uni-
versity scientists, government agency scientists, and NGO scientists--on their own and in
combination. Regarding the former, some recent research finds that university scientists gen-
erally have positive ratings of trust or fairness [63, 64]. Thus, it seems likely that including uni-
versity scientists in a collaboration will have a positive effect on fairness and legitimacy
perceptions.
Including a university partner in a research collaboration (H2a) directly increases perceived
fairness and (H2b) indirectly increases perceived legitimacy.
Past research on conflict of interest does not, however, examine how people perceive gov-
ernment agency or NGO partners. The limited research on trust in scientists reveals that both
of these groups are seen more positively than are industry scientists but less positively than are
university scientists (e.g., [65, 66]). Given the lack of clear theoretical or empirical direction,
we pose the effects of these partners as research questions.
What effect does including a government agency partner in a research collaboration have
(Research Question 1a) directly on perceived fairness and (RQ1b) indirectly on perceived
legitimacy?
What effect does including an NGO partner in a research collaboration have (RQ2a)
directly on perceived fairness and (RQ2b) indirectly on perceived legitimacy?

Stimulus. Study 1 subjects were told that we wanted to learn their views about "a potential
new cooperative research partnership aimed at studying the possible negative health impacts
of low levels of transfats in food." "S1 Text Stimulus." The only part of the message that varied
across the experimental conditions was the specific combination of the following partners:
· Kellogg's (a food company);
· Purdue University;
Perceived conflict of interest in health partnerships
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175643 April 20, 2017 5 / 20
· The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, a government agency); and
· The Union of Concerned Scientists (a non-governmental organization).
The 15 experimental conditions included each possible combination of one, two, three, and
four of these partners. We selected these four organizations as representatives of agrifood busi-
nesses, research universities, governmental agencies, and NGOs, respectively, given the results
of a pre-test with undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university "S1 Table." Briefly,
the pre-test participants viewed these four organizations more positively and less negatively
than they viewed similar organizations in these four sectors.
Data collection. We administered our experiment via Qualtrics to subjects we recruited
via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), a crowdsourcing website where "requesters" solicit
"workers" to perform "human intelligence tasks" (HITs) for pay. AMT has emerged as a prac-
tical way for recruiting a large number of participants from a reasonably wide cross-section of
the general public--considerably more diverse than the traditional experiment recruitment
pools of university undergraduates or surrounding community residents--either for online
experiments (e.g., [67]) or for designing and testing new measurement instruments (e.g., [68])
across the social sciences (e.g., [69, 70]). Although the external validity of crowdsourced sam-
ples is limited (especially when compared to the generalizability of rigorously drawn represen-
tative samples), several studies confirm the value of AMT samples for assessing internal
validity related to cause and effect, especially with between-subject experiments [70­72]. Fur-
ther, we see no a priori reason to expect that the pattern of results found using our AMT sam-
ple would vary substantially with a different sample.
To solicit a broad cross-section of research subjects and minimize self-selection by AMT
workers highly interested in food issues, we advertised a HIT titled "Industry Views Survey."
We limited participation to adults residing in the United States. Because this was an online
experiment, the first page of the questionnaire included the approved consent statement, and
subjects were asked to indicate consent by continuing with the questionnaire.
Subjects completed our experiment between April 19 and May 15, 2015. They earned $0.40
for participating, and the average response time was approximately seven minutes. We used
two factual comprehension questions to screen out those subjects who failed to correctly iden-
tify the collaborative partners mentioned in their stimulus text. Our final sample includes 526
subjects who correctly answered both questions. An a priori power analysis for one-way
ANOVA (main effects and interactions) with 15 groups conducted using GÃPower [73], with a
desired alpha of .05 and a power of .90 for a small/medium effect size (f = 0.15), shows that 469
respondents were needed for the current design. Approximately 53% of these subjects are
female, 80% are white, and the average age is 39 (SD = 13). Also, about 27% of these subjects
only have a high school diploma or GED, another 16% have earned up to an Associate's
degree, 43% hold a Bachelor's degree, and an additional 4% have earned a doctorate or PhD.
Measures. As noted, we operationalized conflict of interest as perceived procedural fairness
with a scale of seven items adapted from Leventhal [74]. Subjects indicated the extent to which
they disagreed ("strongly disagree" = 1) or agreed ("strongly agree" = 7) that "the research
partnership" will "ignore stakeholders that they disagree with" [reverse-coded], "listen to each
other's views," "draw on the best available evidence," "keep the best interests of consumers in
mind," "hide important findings if they don't support their organizations" [reverse-coded],
"work hard to avoid biasing their results," and "slant their research to favor industry needs"
[reverse-coded]. The order of these items was randomized. This perceived procedural fairness
scale is highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha = .93).
The perceived procedural fairness scale correlated highly (r = -.67, p <.01) with a single-
item indicator of conflict of interest included in the experiment. For the latter, subjects

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175643 April 20, 2017 6 / 20
reported whether they believed the partnership described would create "NO conflict of inter-
est" = 1 to "a COMPLETE conflict of interest = 7 (M = 3.47, SD = 2.05). We used the per-
ceived procedural fairness scale rather than this single-item indicator here because of the
measurement advantages of multi-item scales and the conceptual desire to advance proce-
dural fairness as a theoretically grounded way to study conflict of interest. The results of
additional analyses using the single-item indicator (available upon request) are similar to
what we present below.
We measured perceived legitimacy with a scale of three items asking subjects about how the
proposed research should be used. Subjects indicated the extent to which they disagreed
("strongly disagree" = 1) or agreed ("strongly agree" = 7) with these three items: "I would
make decisions about my diet based on the results of this partnership," "government should
pay attention to the results of this research partnership," and "I would share the results of this
research with people I know." The order of these items was randomized. This perceived legiti-
macy scale is reliable (Cronbach's alpha = .79).
The results of exploratory factor analysis using Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Vari-
max rotation (available upon request) indicate that the three perceived legitimacy items are
distinct from the seven perceived procedural fairness items. Yet, the two scales are highly cor-
related (r = .64, p<0.01).
Analyses
We conducted most of our analyses with SPSS 22. We first performed a one-way ANOVA
with post-hoc tests looking only at main effects. The results of a General Linear Model (GLM)
analysis (not shown) suggested no substantial interaction effects between the various condi-
tions and we therefore focus here on main effects in the context of the hypothesized mediation.
To this end, after looking at means, we conducted a more detailed analysis using the PROCESS
macro for testing simple mediation [75]. PROCESS is well-established add-on to statistical
packages such as SPSS that uses ordinary linear regression to estimate direct and indirect rela-
tionships and test for mediation. It can also be used to probe interactions. We ran this media-
tion model (with 1,000 bootstrap samples) four times to obtain estimates of both direct and
indirect effects associated with having each type of organization involved in the partnership.
Bootstrapping allows for the calculation of confidence intervals for indirect effects. These con-
fidence intervals can be used to assess the statistical significance, something not possible in
older approaches to assessing mediation such as those popularized by Baron and Kenny [76].
Mediation analyses such as these cannot confirm that fairness perceptions cause legitimacy
perceptions, but the ordering is consistent with the underlying literature. Both variables are
also treated as continuous variables for the purpose of linear modeling and, as the independent
variables are dichotomous, the provided coefficients can be understood as the effect of includ-
ing that partner in the partnership on the dependent variable. We include the PROCESS analy-
ses as the primary assessment of the degree to which the results are at least consistent with our
hypotheses and research questions.
Additional ways of analyzing the data (e.g., including a measure for the number of partners,
or a measure for the number of non-industry partners in a regression model, not shown) simi-
larly provided little additional explanatory power. Also, as noted above, we focus here on the
separate main effect of each potential collaborator in the research partnership on both per-
ceived procedural fairness and, ultimately, perceived legitimacy. Using Mplus 7, we also per-
formed structural equation modeling (SEM) using latent variables for perceived procedural
fairness and perceived legitimacy. These SEM results--which are displayed in "S2 Table"--are
similar to PROCESS analyses.

Results
Table 1 reports post hoc analyses associated with an initial one-way, between-subjects
ANOVA for Study 1. The one way ANOVA test for main effects found that there were statisti-
cally significant but somewhat small differences in main effect between the various types of
partnerships, both for perceived procedural fairness of the research process [F(511, 14) = 6.90,
p < .01, 2 = .16)] and for perceived legitimacy of the resulting research [F(511, 14) = 4.17,
p < .01, 2 = .10].
Table 1 provides the results of post-hoc Tukey HSD tests for the perceived procedural fair-
ness comparisons and the results of Games-Howell tests for the perceived legitimacy compari-
sons. We used two different tests to assess pairwise differences between the various conditions
because Levene tests suggested equal variances between conditions for the perceived proce-
dural fairness variable [F(511, 14) = .80, p = .67] but unequal variances for the perceived legiti-
macy variable [F(511, 14) = 1.94, p = .02]. The results of these tests indicate that including
Kellogg's in a research partnership investigating the health effects of small amounts of transfats
in foods decreases both perceived procedural fairness and perceived legitimacy of the proposed
research. Indeed, the partnerships with the eight lowest means for perceived procedural fair-
ness and for perceived legitimacy each include Kellogg's. The impacts of the inclusion of other
partners are less clear in Table 1, though it does appear that partnerships including the UCS
are perceived as fairer and more legitimate than partnerships that do not include the NGO.
Table 2 presents the results of the PROCESS mediation model for Study 1. Such models are
based on Ordinary Least Squares regression but include two parts; the first part involves pre-
dicting the initial outcome that is hypothesized as the mediator (perceived procedural fairness,
in this case) and the second part involves predicting the outcome that is the ultimate depen-
dent variable (perceived legitimacy, in this case). In both cases, the estimates can be under-
stood as unstandardized regression coefficients. The PROCESS macro then also provides a
calculation of the overall direct relationship between the various independent variables and
the indirect effect that is accounted for through the mediator with bootstrapping used to pro-
vide 95% confidence intervals in the absence of a statistical test for indirect effects. Statistical
significance for the indirect effects, in this regard, can thus be understood as confidence inter-
vals that do not include zero.
Overall the Study 1 model explains 15% of the variation in perceived procedural fairness
and 42% of the variation in perceived legitimacy. These results, more than the mean compari-
sons, clearly convey the effect of including Kellogg's in a research partnership investigating the
health effects of small amounts of transfats in foods. Including Kellogg's leads to an almost
1-unit decrease in the 7-unit scale for perceived procedural fairness (supporting H1a). The test
of indirect effects in the bottom part of Table 2 shows that the inclusion of Kellogg's has a sta-
tistically significant negative indirect effect on perceived legitimacy through its negative effect
on perceived procedural fairness (supporting H1b).
Further, including the UCS in a partnership leads to a 0.41-unit increase in perceived pro-
cedural fairness (RQ2a). This inclusion also has a positive effect on perceived legitimacy via
the indirect, positive path through perceived procedural fairness (RQ2b). Including Purdue
University in a partnership has no statistically significant effect on either perceived procedural
fairness or perceived legitimacy, offering no support to H2a and H2b, respectively. Also,
including the CDC in a partnership has no statistically significant effect on perceived proce-
dural fairness (RQ1a), but it does have a positive, direct effect on perceived legitimacy (RQ1b).
Overall, Study 1 clearly supports H1a and H1b. Including a private sector representative in
a research partnership decreases the extent to which people perceive the collaboration as pro-
cedurally fair. Further, the pattern of results is consistent with the idea that this negative

impact may reduce the extent to which people perceive the research results as a legitimate
source of knowledge for use in their lives. Of course, these results may somewhat be an artifact
of the particular issue we examined in Study 1. To allay such concern, we conducted a second,
nearly identical experiment that focused on a different health science issue.
Study 2
For Study 2, we chose to focus on the health impacts of genetically modified (GM) food. Indus-
try funding of GM food research has received considerable public attention (e.g., [6]). Further,
science and risk communication scholars [77] are devoting more attention to the topic, even
applying procedural justice scholarship to understand public perceptions [57]. To aim for
wider generalizability across Studies 1 and 2, we further clarified that the proposed research on
GM food would investigate possible positive health impacts of new GM grains (e.g., rice,
wheat, corn) that are being designed to absorb less toxic substances from the soil than do cur-
rent grains. "S2 Text Stimulus." This focus on the potential positive health impacts of GM food
in Study 2 may tap different dynamics than does the focus on the potential negative health
impacts of small amounts of transfats in food in Study 1. (The consent process was identical to
Study 1).
Methods
As with study 1, the Institutional Review Board of the Human Research Protection Program at
Michigan State University approved this research (IRB#x15-167e)(exempt).
Other than shifting the substantive focus from transfats to GM food and replacing the CDC
with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the governmental agency partner,
Study 2 employed the same design and identical measures to those used in Study 1. We again
administered our experiment via Qualtrics to adult U.S. residents we recruited via AMT with a

HIT titled "Collaboration between Different Research Partners." Subjects completed our
experiment between July 8 and July 14, 2015, and earned $0.75 for participating. The average
response time was approximately eleven minutes. After excluding subjects who participated in
previous studies, our final sample includes 627 subjects who correctly identified the collabora-
tive partners mentioned in their stimulus text. For a discussion of power, see Study 1. Approxi-
mately 55% of subjects are female, 88% are white, and the average age is 37 (SD = 13). Also,
about 31% of subjects have only a high school diploma or GED, another 14% have earned up
to an Associate's degree, 42% hold a Bachelor's degree, and an additional 3% have earned a
doctorate or PhD.
We measured conflict of interest as perceived procedural fairness with the same 7-item scale
(Cronbach's alpha = .93) and perceived legitimacy with the same 3-item scale (Cronbach's
alpha = .81) that we used in Study 1. As in Study 1, the results of exploratory factor analysis
using Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Varimax rotation (available upon request) indi-
cate that the three perceived legitimacy items are distinct from the seven procedural fairness
items. Yet, the two scales are highly correlated (r = .61, p < .01). Also, the correlation between
a 7-point single-item indicator of conflict of interest and our perceived procedural fairness
scale was again quite high (r = -.60, p < .01). We also performed SEM using latent variables for

perceived procedural fairness and perceived legitimacy. These SEM results, which are dis-
played in S2 Table, are similar to those presented in Table 2.
Results
Table 3 again reports means and post-hoc test results from a one-way, between-subjects
ANOVA results for Study 2. As with Study 1, the omnibus results reveal statistically significant
main effect differences between the various types of partnerships both for perceived procedural
fairness of the research process [F(612, 14) = 5.10, p < .01, 2 = .10)] and for perceived legiti-
macy of the resulting research [F(612, 14) = 3.80, p < .01, 2 = .08)]. This pattern of results,
coupled with the post-hoc tests also reported in Table 3, indicates that including Kellogg's in a
research partnership investigating the health impacts of new GM grains decreases both the
perceived procedural fairness (H1a) and perceived legitimacy (H1b) of the proposed research.
Table 2 also presents the results of the PROCESS mediation model for Study 2. Overall this
model explains 9% of the variation in perceived procedural fairness and 61% of the variation
in perceived legitimacy. These results of the PROCESS mediation model clearly convey the
effect of including Kellogg's in a research partnership investigating GM grains. Including Kel-
logg's leads to a 0.73-unit decrease in perceived procedural fairness (supporting H1a). The test
of indirect effects in the bottom part of Table 2 suggests that the inclusion of Kellogg's has a
statistically significant negative indirect effect on perceived legitimacy through its negative
effect on perceived procedural fairness (supporting H1b).
As in Study 1, including the UCS in a partnership leads to an increase in perceived proce-
dural fairness (RQ2a). The results are again consistent with a potential positive effect of this
partner on perceived legitimacy via the indirect, positive path through perceived procedural
fairness (RQ2b). Including Purdue in a partnership has no statistically significant effect on
either perceived procedural fairness or perceived legitimacy, offering no support to H2a and
H2b, respectively. While including a governmental agency (the CDC) in a partnership has a
positive, direct effect on perceived legitimacy (RQ1b) in Study 1, it does not have such an effect
in Study 2 (the FDA).
The results of Study 2 largely confirm those of Study 1, increasing our confidence in the pat-
terns we have found. Given the size and consistency of this effect, we conducted a third experi-
ment to gather some qualitative data to better understand why subjects perceive the inclusion
of a private sector partner with such skepticism.
Study 3
Methods
As with studies 1 and 2, the Institutional Review Board of the Human Research Protection
Program at Michigan State University approved this research (IRB#x15-167e)(exempt).
Study 3 used the same transfats stimulus and between-subjects design with 15 randomly
assigned conditions as in Study 1. After providing consent in the same manner as in Studies 1
and 2, subjects read their assigned description of a proposed partnership to examine the effects
of small amounts of transfats in foods and answered the same three comprehension questions
as used in Study 1. The remainder of the experiment simply asked subjects to respond to three
open-ended questions about the partnership and its research. Below, we describe the results of
a content analysis of responses to the following question.
Please share your views about the nature of the proposed research partnership itself. In
your answer, please address the following. What are the strengths and limitations of the pro-
posed partnership? Please fully explain your answer, including any positive or negative
thoughts you have about any specific partners.

The other two questions addressed perceived impacts of the research and the types of activi-
ties the respondent thought might help mitigate potential problems and were meant to assist
with future research. These are not addressed here.
We administered our experiment via Qualtrics to adult U.S. residents we recruited via
AMT with a HIT titled "Answer a Few Questions about a Proposed Scientific Partnership."
Our experiment was completed by 305 U.S. residents on May 31, 2015. Subjects earned $0.75
for completing the experiment, which took slightly less than eight minutes on average. After
excluding subjects who participated in Study 1, our final sample includes 222 subjects who
provided correct answers to three comprehension questions. That is, they (a) knew that food
producers use transfats to give food softer texture, (b) knew that the described study would
examine if small amounts of transfats are unhealthy, and (c) correctly identified the presence
or absence of Kellogg's in the proposed partnership.
A co-author well-experienced in qualitative research performed the qualitative data analy-
sis. Given that our specific objective (to better understand why inclusion of a private sector
partner engendered heightened skepticism) was fairly straightforward and the data structure
(brief responses to a single open-ended question) was relatively simple, we decided that multi-
ple coders were unnecessary. Our co-author employed an inductive coding scheme to analyze
responses to the italicized question above. First, he read all the responses, coding them for the
presence or absence of negative, positive, and/or neutral comments. In doing so, he also identi-
fied 13 substantive themes that emerged from subjects' responses [78]. With this list of poten-
tial themes, he then re-read all the responses and coded them for the presence or absence of
each substantive theme. Approximately 11% of responses contained no theme, nearly 49%
contained just one, about 35% contained only two, and approximately 6% contained three
themes. Below, we report and discuss those seven substantive themes appearing in at least 10%
of responses.

Results
Given our interest in public reaction to the inclusion of a private sector representative in a sci-
entific partnership, we analyzed subjects' responses in two subsamples: subjects who responded
to partnerships including Kellogg's (120 or 54%) and those who responded to partnerships that
did not include Kellogg's (102 or 46%). When the proposed partnership included Kellogg's,
77% (92 of 120) of responses included a negative comment, 54% (65) included a positive com-
ment, and 4% (5) remained neutral with neither a clearly positive nor clearly negative comment.
When the proposed partnership did not include Kellogg's, only 28% (29) of responses included
a negative comment, 79% (81) of responses included a positive comment, and 9% (9) of
responses remained neutral. The rather large difference in the percentage of negative responses
across the two subsamples (48%) generally confirms the patterns revealed in Studies 1 and 2.
Table 4 reports the most prevalent themes--with italicized illustrative examples--about the
proposed partnership that emerged from our content analysis. The percentages in Table 4 sum
to more than 100, since subjects' responses may contain more than one theme.
With Kellogg's as a partner. Three major themes emerged from responses by subjects
exposed to partnerships including Kellogg's. Almost 70% of these subjects noted that Kellogg's
is so problematic as a partner that its mere inclusion may call the entire partnership into ques-
tion. The presence of Kellogg's in the partnership provoked distrust and skepticism among
many subjects. Indeed, when these subjects mentioned both positive and negative aspects of
the partnership, the positives nearly always referred to partners or features other than Kel-
logg's, and the negatives nearly always referred to Kellogg's. Some assumed that Kellogg's
would likely try to skew the research results to their private interests and/or conceal undesir-
able results. Kellogg's was described as "clearly," "very," "extremely," "incredibly," and
"strongly" biased with an "ulterior motive," "profit motive," "vested financial interest," and
"conflict of interest."
Almost one-third of responses (30%) claimed that other groups in the partnership might
provide at least some checks on the financial influence and possibly dubious activities of Kel-
logg's. These subjects believed that non-Kellogg's partners would add scientific credibility and
honesty to the research, while reducing the likelihood that Kellogg's bias would influence
methods and results. Subjects sometimes expected, and at other times merely hoped, that this
would be the case. Generally, subjects seemed more confident in Purdue's ability to counter-
balance Kellogg's influence than in the abilities of the CDC or UCS to do so. Indeed, a few sub-
jects even acknowledged that other partners (notably, the CDC) may be easily manipulated by
Kellogg's.
Finally, about one-fourth of subjects (27%) mentioned that the partnership was at least
minimally good, even if giving reservations. These responses described the partnership as
"good," "great," "worthwhile," "strong," and "balanced." They noted that the diverse member-
ship of organizations working together would bring different interests and points of view
together to strengthen the resulting research.
Without Kellogg's as a partner. Four major themes emerged from the responses of sub-
jects exposed to partnerships not including Kellogg's. The most prevalent theme, found in 67%
of responses, was that the partnership was at least somewhat good--as illustrated by responses
calling the partnership "a very good idea," "fruitful," "very beneficial," "greatly beneficial," and
"great." Several subjects voiced the adage that "more heads are better than one," noting that
multiple partners assure thoroughness and that partnerships can often achieve greater
advances than when just one actor goes it alone. Overall, a good number of responses con-
veyed the expectation that the partnership would produce important, reliable, and useful
results that would improve our understanding of the health risks of transfats.

Approximately one-fourth of subjects (25%) explicitly noted that the partners seemed
immune to outside influence and had little or no conflict of interest or bias. Subjects claimed
that the partners seem "fairly objective," "like relatively neutral parties," and "an unbiased
group" with no clear agenda. Key here seemed to be the perception of no obvious interests in
the outcome of the research, since the partners were not funded or employed by food compa-
nies. Because of this, subjects expected that the research would be performed in "an honest
and unbiased manner."
On the other hand, a third theme (found in 17% of responses) expressed concern about
potential conflict of interest or bias. Subjects conveyed either general concerns about the
broad influence of money or the potential for one partner to dominate another, or they
focused more specifically on the potential financial conflicts of interests of individual scientists.
Yet, a final theme (found in 12% of responses) claimed that the differences between the

When the Partnership includes Kellogg's (N = 120) % Mentioning
Kellogg's Is a Problematic Partner
[I]t seems that [Kellogg's] may have an incentive to skew results to maximize their profits.
[Kellogg's has] a vested interest in the outcome so the results would be completely invalid in
my eyes.. . . just the fact that a food company is involved makes me think of the tobacco
industry and all that corruption.
69
The Non-Kellogg's Partners May Provide At Least Some Checks on Kellogg's
Inclusion of a food company that has a vested financial interest in the result is a pretty big
limitation on the validity of the results. On the other hand, [UCS] and CDC might provide a
reasonable check and balance. . .Kellogg's. . . has a vested interest in being able to continue
to use transfats. The other 3 organizations involved do not have the same financial incentive
and thus will hopefully help balance out this bias.
30
The Partnership Is At Least Somewhat Good
I believe this would be a good partnership. This would provide different sides to the research
so an unbiased result can be made.
Overall it looks like a strong partnership.
27
When the Partnership Does Not Include Kellogg's (N = 102) % Mentioning
The Partnership Is At Least Somewhat Good
The partnership includes a wide variety of interests. I believe that conflicts of interest can be
avoided because of this.
It sounds like a good unbiased partnership. The 3 partners have nothing to gain from the
results of the study and 1 is a government group.
67
The Partnership Has Little or No Conflict of Interest or Bias
I see no conflict of interest or any reason to believe (at this time) that their study would be
conducted in any way other than in an honest and unbiased manner.
The strengths would be that fair research would be done without conflict of interest.
25
Concern about Potential or Future Conflict of Interest or Bias
There is always a chance that there may be a (monetary) conflict of interest with some of
the scientist involved. Unfortunately money is the root of all BAD studies.
While I like the partnership between academia and the federal government I am still
concerned that there may or may not be an "agenda" or pre-conceived results desired from
this study.
17
The Partners' Differences Will Balance Out
I don't think any institution or government agency or scientist can be trusted anymore to
make any claims without political interest. Maybe by combining them, there can be some
balance.
The strengths would be that scientists from different organizations would be coming
together, which would hopefully expand expertise and decrease any conflicts of interest.

Note: Percentages sum to more than 100, since subjects may mention more than one theme in their
responses.

partners would balance out and their different points of view would likely neutralize any
potential conflicts of interest or bias. Such subjects argued that one or more partners would
serve as a counterbalance to any pressure another partner would potentially assert to bias the
methods or results.
Conclusion
Private industry now dominates U.S. R&D funding [1], and university scientists are under
increasing pressure to seek non-government funding and participate in public-private partner-
ships with private sector representatives [2­4]. Yet, much research has documented that in
some cases industry-funded research may be less than credible, especially where the risk of reg-
ulation is nontrivial (e.g., [8, 9, 11, 79]). Further, public skepticism of industry-funded
research--heightened by revelations about bias in such work--may likely constrain the effi-
cacy and influence of its results (e.g., [5, 6]).
We performed three experiments to investigate public perception of industry-funded
research. Building upon efforts to adapt procedural justice scholarship to the study of health
and risk communication (e.g., [57, 59, 80]), we drew insights from procedural justice research
to examine how the inclusion of an industry partner in a scientific collaboration influences the
perceived procedural fairness of the partnership and the perceived legitimacy of the resulting
research.
We found fairly consistent results across Studies 1 and 2. In both experiments, including
Kellogg's in a scientific partnership indirectly decreased perceived legitimacy of the partner-
ship's research via its negative effect on the perceived procedural fairness of the partnership.
Also in both experiments, including an NGO (UCS) in a scientific partnership indirectly
increased perceived legitimacy via its positive effect on perceived procedural fairness. Neither
the inclusion of Purdue University nor the inclusion of a government agency (the CDC or the
FDA) in the scientific partnership had a consistent effect on perceived procedural fairness or
perceived legitimacy across both studies.
The results of Study 3 provided qualitative insights for better understanding the negative
effect of including Kellogg's on both the perceived procedural fairness and perceived legiti-
macy of the scientific partnership. Subjects exposed to a scientific partnership including Kel-
logg's were nearly three times more likely to offer a negative comment about the partnership
than were subjects exposed to a scientific partnership not including Kellogg's. The former
group of subjects expressed deep concern that Kellogg's financial interests would lead it to
skew the results of the partnership in ways favorable for the company. Although some subjects
hoped that including other actors--whether research universities, government agencies, or
NGOs--in the partnership might reduce this potential for bias, few reported with confidence
that this would actually happen. In contrast, when Kellogg's was not included in the partner-
ship, subjects generally believed that the resulting research would be conducted fairly.
We end by briefly outlining an agenda for moving this scholarship forward. First, additional
research should aim to replicate this study to more completely assess the consistency and gen-
eralizability of our results. Such future research could (a) explore a wider array of substantive
areas (e.g., environmental impacts associated with new technologies, health impacts of indus-
trial chemicals, effectiveness of drugs or supplements), (b) consider different kinds of potential
research partners, and (c) examine whether it matters what the partnership ultimately finds.
Procedural justice scholarship could provide additional insight here inasmuch as past results
suggest that people may discount results they disagree with if they learn about these results
before learning about the processes that lead to the results [47]. Another important avenue of
research would (d) involve considering additional procedures (e.g., independent advisory
Perceived conflict of interest in health partnerships
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175643 April 20, 2017 15 / 20
boards, transparency tools, etc.), beyond partnerships, that organizations might use either on
their own or in combination. Also, as noted above, it may be worth considering additional
work related to the question of interactions between partners or the effects of adding multiple
partners. As noted, we conducted initial analyses on these types of questions using the data
here, but ultimately we decided to focus on the main effects of each partner. We saw little evi-
dence that the combinations mattered, and it therefore made more sense to us to focus on the
most parsimonious model for this initial study. However, this should not be taken as strong
evidence that it does not make sense to consider partnership combinations both for research
and in real life.
Second, given the sizable contribution of industry funding to scientific research in the U.S.
and especially if additional studies replicate our results, future multidisciplinary work should
investigate historical and contemporary efforts to implement procedures that aim to reduce
conflicts of interest due to industry involvement. This may include both historical and socio-
logical research into what organizations have done or are doing, as well as potentially identify-
ing the additional procedures (or combinations of procedures) that might be tried. Insights
from procedural justice scholarship may further guide this research. For example, those inter-
ested in the cognitive mechanisms behind fairness perceptions could test, for example, whether
communicating about conflict of interest mitigation procedures are more effective when sub-
jects are forced to think heuristically or when they are more uncertain about the underlying
topics (e.g., [81]).
