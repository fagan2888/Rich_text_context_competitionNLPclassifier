Abstract
We attempt to elucidate whether there might be a causal connection between the socioeconomic status (SES) of the rearing
environment and obesity in the offspring using data from two large-scale adoption studies: (1) The Copenhagen Adoption
Study of Obesity (CASO), and (2) The Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families (HOLT). In CASO, the SES of both biological
and adoptive parents was known, but all children were adopted. In HOLT, only the SES of the rearing parents was known,
but the children could be either biological or adopted. After controlling for relevant covariates (e.g., adoptee age at
measurement, adoptee age at transfer, adoptee sex) the raw (unstandardized) regression coefficients for adoptive and
biological paternal SES on adoptee body mass index (BMI: kg/m2) in CASO were -.22 and -.23, respectively, both statistically
significant (p = 0.01). Controlling for parental BMI (both adoptive and biological) reduced the coefficient for biological
paternal SES by 44% (p = .034) and the coefficient for adoptive paternal SES by 1%. For HOLT, the regression coefficients for
rearing parent SES were -.42 and -.25 for biological and adoptive children, respectively. Controlling for the average BMI of
the rearing father and mother (i.e., mid-parental BMI) reduced the SES coefficient by 47% in their biological offspring
(p#.0001), and by 12% in their adoptive offspring (p = .09). Thus, despite the differing structures of the two adoption
studies, both suggest that shared genetic diathesis and direct environmental transmission contribute about equally to the
association between rearing SES and offspring BMI.

Introduction
In its strategic plan for obesity research, the National Institutes
of Health of the United States proposed, ``Socioeconomic status is
also related to the incidence and prevalence of obesity, such that
the poor are disproportionately affected by obesity, regardless of
race/ethnicity. Research is needed to further understand the
impact of socioeconomic status on the development of obesity.''
The inverse association observed in developed societies between
obesity and indicators of socioeconomic status (SES), such as
occupational status, income, and education has been well
established [1­4] for nearly a half century [5,6]. However, the
nature and magnitude of the causal connection implied by the
word ``impact'' in the quotation above is less clear.
There are multiple plausible causal relations underlying the
SES-obesity association [7]. These include the hypotheses that:
(a) lower SES causes an increased likelihood of development of
obesity [8,9]; (b) obesity causes a decline in SES through factors
such as cognitive and educational difficulties [10­12] downward
marriage, lost earnings due to sickness, or employment and wage
discrimination [13]; and (c) obesity and low SES share some
common genetic or environmental causes. Because both obesity
[14­16] and SES [17­19] are, to some extent, under genetic
control, both pleiotropic effects and correlated genetic effects
may be considered, the latter possibly due to assortative mating
of wealthy and thin people [20]. Thus, because obesity is
genetically influenced and may lead to low SES, the observed
association between low SES in the rearing environment and the
development of obesity in the offspring may be only an
epiphenomenon due to genetic transmission of the predisposition
to obesity [21].
Although these hypotheses are neither mutually exclusive nor
exhaustive, it is important to distinguish between hypothesis (a)
and the others. That is, if it is true that low SES increases the
likelihood of obesity through a direct causal effect then efforts to
identify and subsequently modify the causative aspects of a low

SES rearing environment would be justified. Alternatively, if the
association is due to obesity causing a decline in SES then policies
designed only to modify SES may not be effective.
Voluntary adoptions, in which young children are randomly
assigned to rearing environments differing in SES, can be thought
of as `natural experiments' that can be used to estimate whether
there are potential causal effects of the SES of the rearing
environment on subsequent obesity. A Danish adoption study
that implemented this notion found that the parental SES of both
biological and adoptive parents was inversely associated with
BMI in the adult offspring [21]. Previous analyses of these
adoption data showed that the BMI of the adoptees was
associated with the BMI of the biological parents, but not of
the adoptive parents [14]. Under the general assumptions of
typical adoption studies, if a trait in the offspring is correlated
with a trait in their biological parents who did not raise them, the
cause of that correlation is generally presumed to be genetic. In
contrast, when a trait in the offspring is correlated with a trait in
the adoptive, biologically unrelated, parent who raised them, that
correlation is generally presumed to be due to environmental
factors. Herein we searched the literature for relevant adoption
datasets and combined analyses of parental BMI and SES data to
evaluate the extent to which associations between SES of the
rearing environment and offspring obesity are consistent with the
notion that, besides any common genetic effects, SES causally
contributes to obesity.
Specifically, if the SES of the rearing parents does causally
affect the child's BMI and there were no other ways of generating
this association, then a correlation should exist between the
rearing parents' SES and the BMI of the children they raise,
independent of biological parental BMI. Moreover, the magni-
tude of correlation should be the same whether the child is a
biological or adopted offspring. In contrast, if the correlation
is partly or fully due to a shared genetic diathesis between
SES and BMI, then (i) the correlation between the rearing
parents' SES and the child's BMI should be smaller for the
adopted offspring than for the biological offspring, (ii) a
correlation should exist between the SES of the biological
parents and the BMI of the adopted-away offspring, and (iii) the
correlation between parental SES and biological offspring BMI
should be reduced in absolute value when parental BMI is
controlled (see Appendix S1 which further elucidates a model
underlying these expectations).
In summary, our primary goal was to investigate whether the
association between rearing parent SES and adoptee BMI was
statistically significant, and whether it remained so even after
controlling for rearing parents BMI. We then sought to
disentangle the respective contributions of environmental and
biological components of the association of SES of the rearing
environment and obesity in the offspring (Figure 1).

This study was declared non-human subject's research by the
Institutional Review Board of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham.
Inclusion Criteria and Dataset Search Procedures
We define a family unit to be a collection of any analyzable
combination of adopted offspring, biological offspring of parents in
rearing household, adoptive/rearing parents, and biological
parents as defined in the text. We used data from adoption
studies that met the following criteria: (1) the study provides
information on the weight, height, and/or BMI (measured or self-
reported) of persons raised in adoptive families (adoptees); (2) the
study provides information on the weight, height, and/or BMI
(measured or self-reported) of either adoptive siblings (defined here
as the biological offspring of the adoptive parents) or both the
adoptive rearing parents and the biological parents of the
adoptees; (3) the study provides information on the SES of the
rearing environment (variables such as income, occupational
prestige, and education); (4) the data is publicly available or readily
obtainable; and (5) if data were available on the biological
offspring of the adoptive parents, the regression of the adoptee
BMI on their parents' SES indicators had to be negative in sign
and statistically significant. The reason for including criterion #5
is because we did not wish to assess whether the SES-obesity
association is present in every available dataset (the association
does not necessarily exist in all populations [3,4,22]). Rather, we
wished to study samples where such an association existed in order
to investigate whether we could disentangle the various contribu-
tions of environmental and biological components to the
association. In Appendix S1, we describe simulation studies which
show that criterion #5 is unlikely to have induced any non-trivial
bias.
To obtain data from adoption studies that met the aforemen-
tioned criteria, we searched the following electronic sources: Inter-
University Consortium for Political and Social Research (http://
www.icpsr.umich.edu); the National Center for Health Statistics

cine's Medline and pre-Medline dataset (http://www.ncbi.nlm.

any adoption studies that might meet our inclusion criteria.
Our search yielded eight datasets, two of which (The Survey of
Holt Adoptees and Their Families, 2005 [HOLT] and The
Copenhagen Adoption Study of Obesity [CASO]) met our
inclusion criteria. The 6 other datasets (the National Health
Interview Survey, 1987 Adoption Supplement; the National Child
Development Study, UK; the Colorado Adoption Project; the
Iowa Adoption Project; the Family Life Project; and the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Childbirth and Adoption
History) did not meet all criteria (i.e., did not contain weight/
height or BMI information on adoptive siblings or the adoptive
rearing parents and the biological parents of the adoptees).
Overview of Datasets Used
The two datasets used, the Copenhagen Study of Obesity
(CASO) and the Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families
(HOLT), are described below and in Tables 1 and 2. For both
datasets, there was no minimum SES level required to adopt a
child.
The Copenhagen Study of Obesity (CASO). Based on the
Danish Adoption Register, the CASO [15] consists of non-familial
adoptions in the Copenhagen area between 1924 and 1947.
Around 1980, height, weight, and highest weight ever were
obtained from 3,651 adoptees, among whom 831 were selected on
the basis of their BMI as probands representing the extremes and
the central part of the distribution. The biological and adoptive
families of the proband adoptees were identified, and their weight
and height were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Parent reports
of height and weight were used if available. If data from parents
were unavailable, due to death or some other circumstance, the
information was obtained from the offspring (i.e., adoptive
offspring for adoptive parents and biological offspring for
biological parents). Three-hundred and ninety (36%) of the
adoptive offspring provided adoptive parental data, while 208
biological offspring (19.2%) provided biological parental data.
This potentially introduces uncertainty and hence dilution of the
correlations, but hopefully no systematic bias [23]. Information
about the occupation of the biological and adoptive fathers was
available in the original adoption records for granting the
adoption. The occupation was converted to a prestige-based
SES score, developed in the late 1950s by Kaare Svalastoga, from
3,000 Danish occupations that were rated on a validated 8-point
scale, ranging from 0 (unskilled worker) to 7 (advanced
professional positions) [17­19]. The prestige of a given
occupation associates moderately well with variables such as
income and educational attainment [17]. Only paternal (both
adoptive and biological) SES was used because in that time period
in Denmark, far fewer women, especially of the age considered,
than men would have had occupations that characterized the
household's SES. The range and variability of SES is considered a
reasonable representation of the general Danish population at the
time the data were collected [17]. The distribution of SES values
of the adoptive fathers was as follows: unskilled worker (14.5%),
semiskilled worker (10.4%), skilled worker (26.5%), subordinate
clerk (14.4%), skilled worker with own business (20.9%), sub-
academic professions (8.5%), academic positions (4.5%), and
advanced professional positions (0.3%). Though not definitive, it is
possible that adoptive fathers in CASO may have a higher mean
SES than the general population while adoptees have a mean SES
that is comparable to the general population [17,18]. Age at
transfer of the adoptee to the adoptive family was also available in
the original records. Thus, the BMI and SES of both the biological
and rearing parents were fitted as predictor variables; this adjusted
for any shared genetic diathesis between BMI and SES.
The Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families
(HOLT). The study focused on families who adopted a
Korean-American child through Holt International Children's
Services from 1970 to 1980. The adoptees were quasi-randomly
assigned to families in infancy using a queuing policy (i.e., on a first
come, first served basis). The agency conducted a follow-up
survey, HOLT, for family members when the adoptees had grown
into adulthood [24]. The HOLT was conducted from January
2004 to June 2006 and was designed to assess the health,
educational attainment, and socioeconomic status of adult
Korean-American adoptees and their adoptive families. Adoptive
parents and a small subset of adult adoptees were surveyed, and
each case represented an adopted or non-adopted child in the
family. Adoptive parents provided their age, sex, marital status,
occupation, education level, household income, height, weight,
tobacco and alcohol usage, and the number of children they had.
Adoptive parents also provided similar information on their

adopted and non-adopted children. Fifty-eight percent of families
had an annual household income greater than $40,000; 46.8% of
adoptive mothers had 16 or more years of education; and 64.2%
of fathers had 16 or more years of education. The overall survey
response rate was 27%.
Statistical Analysis
We opted to use traditional regression modeling, as opposed to
structural equation modeling, for the following reasons: (1) ease of
implementation, (2) ease of communication, and (3) robustness.
Regarding robustness, structural equation modeling is more
sensitive to violations in assumptions or normality than ordinary
least squares (OLS) regression. Moreover, OLS regression also
afforded us the opportunity to perform sensitivity analyses and
diagnostics (i.e., bootstrapping, residuals analyses) to examine
robustness. In each dataset, missing data were handled by multiple
imputation [25] as described in Appendix S1.
The Copenhagen Adoption Study of Obesity (CASO).
The dependent variable modeled was adoptee BMI. Residuals
from models with adoptee BMI as the dependent variable were not
normally distributed. Hence, adoptee BMI data were normalized by
a log transformation and then re-scaled to have the same mean and
variance as the original data. Covariates included adoptee age at
measurement, adoptee age at transfer, adoptee sex, and age of all
parents (adoptive and biological) at the time of the adoptee's birth.
The primary independent variables were adoptive and biological
paternal SES. The difference between the regression coefficients for
adoptive versus biological paternal SES were tested as described by
Neter et al. [26]. Investigating this difference allows us to assess
whether there is a possible causal effect of the SES of the rearing
environment. Specifically, if the magnitude of the regression
coefficients for the biological and the adoptive father's SES are
similar and not significant, it would suggest that the genetic
influence on BMI and its influence on SES of the rearing
environment each accounted for roughly half the correlation
between rearing environment SES and BMI. This was
accomplished by using a simple linear reparametrization of the
model such that one of the original two predictor variables (adoptive
and biological paternal SES) are replaced in the model by their sum
and the other variable is retained in its original form. Under this
parameterization, the test of whether the raw (unstandardized)
regression coefficient for the variable retained in its original form is
not zero is arithmetically identical to a test of the equality of the
regression coefficients for the two original predictor variables.
Changes in parameter estimates when additional variables were
included in the models were tested as described by Clogg et al. [27].
Clogg et al showed that in linear regression analysis, if a regression
coefficient for a predictor (X1
) is not zero in a univariate model with
Y as a response variable and if X1
is also significantly correlated with
another variable, X2
, then if the coefficient for X2
is significant when
added into a regression model also containing X1
, this is equivalent
to showing that the coefficient for X1
changed significantly with the
inclusion of X2
in the model. Sensitivity analyses were conducted via
bootstrap to ensure that any departure from normality due to the
extreme sampling plan used by CASO (see above) did not lead to
biased inference.
The Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families
(HOLT). Because data on multiple children from the same
family were available, a linear mixed model (LMM) with
correlated residuals in a compound symmetric structure was
used to account for within-family effects. HOLT included 2,886
children from 1,207 families. The predictor variables for HOLT
included the child's age and gender, the adoptive family's SES, the
adoptive mother's BMI, and the adoptive father's BMI. The
child's BMI was regressed on these variables. The adoptive
family's SES was computed through Principal Components
Analysis (PCA). The PCA incorporated the mother's education
(highest completed grade), the father's education (highest
completed grade), and household income. Z-scores from the
standardized first principal component were used as predictors.

the joint regression coefficient of adoptive and biological paternal
SES (that is the value if the regression coefficient estimated for
both adoptive and biological parents' SES is constrained to be
equal) was statistically significant (p = 0.011). The difference
between the regression coefficients for the biological and the
adoptive father's SES was not significant (p = 0.982) and the two
coefficients were very similar (-.22 and -.23, respectively). This
supports the notion of a possible causal effect of the SES of the
rearing environment in that the correlation between the genetic
influence on BMI and its influence on SES each accounted for
roughly half the correlation between rearing environment SES
and BMI (see Appendix S1 for an elaboration of the model
underlying this conclusion).
Controlling for parental BMI (both adoptive and biological)
reduced the coefficient for biological paternal SES by roughly half
(reduced by 44% in absolute value). Given that biological parent
BMI is significantly correlated with both parental SES and with
adoptee BMI, this reduction was statistically significant (p = 0.034;
cf. 25). In contrast, controlling for parental BMI (both adoptive
and biological) hardly changed the coefficient for adoptive
paternal SES at all (reduced by 0.7% in absolute value). This is
consistent with the idea that controlling for biological parental
BMI controls for the correlated genetic diathesis, but not for any
causal effect from SES (See Figure 2, panels A & B).
The Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families (HOLT)
The rearing parents' BMI was positively associated with the
BMI of biological children, but not with adopted children, which is
consistent with a genetic influence on BMI [12]. In the regression
of biological offspring BMI on rearing parental SES (i.e., the SES
of their biological parents who reared them), the regression
coefficient was -.42 (p = .0004). By comparison, in the regression of
adopted offspring BMI on rearing parental SES, the regression
coefficient was smaller in absolute value (-.25), but also statistically
significant (p = .0096). To assess the difference in association for
biological and adopted children, we conducted tests that
contrasted coefficients within models by following the general
approach described by Neter et al [26] and also with conventional
interaction terms as applicable. The difference between the slopes
of the regressions of offspring BMI on rearing parent SES was not
significant (p = .22), but a test of whether the coefficient for
adopted offspring was different than half the value of the
coefficient for biological offspring (as would be predicted from
the CASO results) was also not significant with a much larger p-
value (p = .75). This suggests that SES and a correlation between
the genetic influences on BMI and the genetic influences on SES
each accounted for roughly half of the correlation between rearing
environment SES and BMI.
Among biological offspring, when mid-parental BMI (the average
of mother and father BMI) was added to the model, the absolute
value of the coefficient fell 47%, from -.42 to -.20 (p = .10 after
adjusting for mid-parental BMI; p,.0001 for the reduction in
value). In contrast, for the adopted offspring, when the mid-parental
BMI of rearing parents was added to the model, the coefficient was
virtually unchanged, from -.25 to -.22 (p = .09 for the change), and
remained statistically significant (p = 0.02). In other words, the effect

of SES was reduced in the presence of mid-parental BMI for
biological children but was not significantly reduced for adopted
children. After adjusting for mid-parental BMI, the apparent effect
of rearing-parent SES was essentially the same in biological and
adopted children (see Figure 2, panels C & D).
Discussion
Our results, from two well-characterized adoption datasets, are
consistent with a model in which both the rearing parents' SES
and the genetic influence on BMI and its relation to SES
contribute equally to the association between rearing parents' SES
and the adiposity of their offspring.
Beyond the aforementioned publication examining the CASO
study, we know of no other studies which have taken the approach
we have to consider adoption as a form of `natural randomization'
to better assess the extent to which the SES association with
obesity represents an effect of SES causing obesity. However, there
is an existing literature discussing multiple alternative causal
hypotheses and the fact that the nature and direction of causation
is not known [16,28]. Despite this, it is generally taken for granted
that the SES obesity relationship represents causation from SES to
obesity. For example, after analyzing an ordinary observational
epidemiological study [29], one author wrote ``There appears to
be a protective effect of higher SES on the weight status of children
and adolescents and it is likely that a wide range of socio-cultural
factors influence the risk of obesity, including typical social
determinants of health such as income, education, access to
nutritious food, access to and affordability of sporting facilities,
health literacy, outdoor environment, and cultural norms of
eating, exercising and ideal weight. As such, the prevention of
childhood obesity is most likely to succeed if these sociocultural
determinants are addressed in interventions targeting schools,
communities and other areas of social and economic disadvan-
tage.'' In addition, components embedded within the environ-
ment, factors such as crime, financial hardship, violence, and
parental neglect may also influence the SES-obesity association.
Before we make definitive causal statements, however, we need to
better assess these potential underlying causal mechanisms
(something that cannot be easily accomplished). Our approach
to using adoption data is one method of doing so. Another may be
the use of studies randomizing persons to receive additional
money. Such studies were done in the 1960s and 1970s, [30]
though we are unaware of any which specifically assessed effects
on weight, BMI, or obesity (except for birth weight). Ironically,
even in present time people are randomized to have more or less
money every day by casinos and lotteries and acquiring data on
persons who participate may be natural ways to further attempt to
assess causation. There is also importance in assessing fundamen-
tal mechanisms of causation. This includes the mechanisms by
which obesity may lead to lower SES, the common genetic
underpinnings, and the mechanisms by which SES may cause
obesity.
With respect to obesity potentially leading to lower SES, obesity
appears to reduce wages given equal qualifications [31], reduce the
likelihood of being hired even given equal qualifications [32],
reduce the probability of attending college even given equal
qualifications [33], predispose toward marrying men of lower SES
among women [34], and may impair cognitive functioning and
health over many years leading to reduced earning capacity [35].
With respect to the potential effects of SES on obesity, common
thinking is that the economic aspects per se (e.g., the relative costs
of various foods) are driving factors [36]. However, we hypothesize
that the `socio' as much or more than the `economic' in
socioeconomic status may cause the connection to obesity. That
is, the self-perception of being low in a social hierarchy, apart from
any specific economic factors, may lead to physiologic, cognitive,
and behavioral changes that ultimately result in the anatomical
changes we call obesity. As evidence of this, consider that
subordinate status birds across many species (willow tit, great tit,
greenfinch, chickadees, titmouse, nuthatch) carry greater fat
reserves than dominant status birds [37,38], subordinate status
rats are hyperphagic and gain more fat mass when removed from
dominant status rats, subordinate hamsters and monkeys consume
more and increase body weight during hierarchical interactions
[39­41] and in humans, lower subjective social status appears to
be associated with higher waist to hip ratio and BMI levels to a
greater degree than are objective economic indicators [42].
Finally, with respect to ideas about common mechanisms
underlying SES and obesity, consider the work of Chib et al.
[43] who found reciprocal relations between ``...the incentive
value of food and of money'' in several experiments in which the
hunger levels of human subjects were manipulated suggesting
connections between the biological mechanisms of drives for
money and food as has also been indicated in fMRI research.
Our study has several strengths. First, the study made new use of
adoption data to address a set of important questions that could
not be ethically investigated via a randomized experimental trial
(c.f., [44]). Second, we used data from two large, well-
characterized datasets related to voluntary adoption. In both
populations, it appears reasonable to assume that the SES of the
rearing environment was independent of the genetic predisposition
to adiposity. Third, we used thorough statistical analyses
permitting us to tease out the associations of interest while
controlling for covariates and other sources of potential bias.
Fourth, despite differences in the time the data were collected, the
country of origin, and the race/ethnicity of the samples, the results
were remarkably consistent. This consistency suggests that the
findings are durable and supports the validity of the causal
inferences we made from the observed associations.
The limitations of this study include: the datasets relied upon
self-reported height and weight as opposed to direct measure-
ments, and moreover, some of the parental weight and height data
were derived by proxy self-report by the children; the age at which
adoptee BMI was assessed was quite different in the two studies;
the two populations studied had relatively low rates of obesity;
certain biases may have been introduced by the use of mail
questionnaires; the adoptees in the CASO study did not come
from abroad, raising the possibility that some adoptees were, in
fact, familial adoptions (however, while we cannot eliminate this
possibility entirely, the Danish Adoption Register sought to filter
out all adoptions where there was some relationship between the
child and the adoptive parents); and we did not investigate the role
additional variables such as neighborhood factors (e.g., stress,
crime, violence) might have had upon the results.
Given these limitations, despite the fact that the two study
populations we analyzed samples from were quite different (e.g.,
HOLT study parents were better educated, offspring BMI was
measured in the CASO study many years after they left their
rearing environment), it should be examined whether our finding
holds in other groups and time periods because the relation
between SES and obesity does not appear to be constant across
populations or within populations across time [3,4]. Hence,
reassessing with more recent data may be valuable, especially if
obesity is more prevalent, although the shorter the follow-up, the
more limited the ability to study long-term effects.
In comparison with the previous analyses conducted with
CASO [21], the present study adds important evidence elucidating

the nature of the association between SES and adiposity. First and
foremost, the inverse correlation between adoptive parental SES
and offspring BMI was confirmed in independent and in very
different study populations. Second, the present study demon-
strated that this correlation was essentially independent of the BMI
of the adoptive parents, which was only indirectly inferred in the
previous study. Third, the present study provided consistent
estimates of the contribution of the established genetic parent-
offspring correlation in BMI to the observed inverse correlation
between parental SES and offspring BMI in natural families in
which the biological parents rear their own biological offspring.
The finding that the association between the SES of the rearing
environment and offspring adiposity has a component that is
independent of the BMI of the rearing parents strongly suggests
that the mechanism is not to be found in the frame of what is
considered `cultural transmission' of obesogenic factors in the
family environment. It is possible that the SES or related
psychosocial factors (e.g., cognition and educational proficiency)
of the offspring are mediating the effects of parental SES by being
related to both the SES of the rearing parents and the subsequent
development of adiposity in the offspring [9,11,12,19]. In the
former analyses of CASO, the inclusion of the SES of the adoptees
in the analysis only partly reduced the correlation between
parental SES and adoptee BMI [21]. Assessment of the association
between SES of the rearing environment and BMI of the adoptees
in childhood, when the parent-offspring correlations in BMI are
established [16], would allow estimation of influences that are not
driven by the SES of the adoptees themselves. The SES of the
rearing environment may also be a proxy for more specific
environmental or psychosocial factors that contribute to adiposity
such as those that under extreme conditions may make parental
neglect of their offspring a very strong predictor of later
development of obesity [45]. Future research should seek to
identify those factors that are causal and may be amendable and to
assess if and how they may interact with the genetic predisposition
to obesity [46,47].
In conclusion, across two different datasets collected during two
different time periods, in two different countries, and for two
different ethnicities, we found remarkably similar results. These
results suggest that roughly half of the association between the SES
of the rearing parents and the subsequent BMI of their biological
offspring whom they rear is due to a potential causal influence of
the rearing parents' SES and that roughly half is an association
due to a genetic correlation between BMI and SES. On the one
hand, implication of some degree of causation is positive because it
suggests that if we can identify the specific aspects of low SES that
predispose to obesity, we may be able to influence such factors to
achieve reductions in obesity risk. On the other hand, the results
suggest that the effects of any such manipulations should be
expected to, at most, have an effect equivalent to half of that which
would be expected if the association were all causal.
