Introduction
Sociology in Turkey was influenced by Western sociology in
general and French sociology in particular during the col-
lapse of Ottoman Empire in hopes that sociology would save
the country. Intellectuals of political and administrative bod-
ies preferred Westernization as their primary tool as Turkey
moved away from its society's own traditional institutions.
When introducing social and cultural innovations to society,
Ottoman intellectuals were deeply affected by French politi-
cal and social thought. According to Sezer (1988), Paris was
the cynosure of intellectuals who spoke against existing gov-
ernment while shaping their political and ideological views.
Ziya Gökalp was the most important politician among them
and was later accepted as the founder of sociology in Turkey;
Gökalp gave sociology lectures at Istanbul University in
1914. Gökalp was also the father of the basic principles of
the newly established Republic of Turkey in 1923. Ziya
Gökalp introduced positivism to Mustafa Kemal, who insti-
tuted major reforms to convert society to modern Western
traditions beginning with changing the alphabet from Arabic
to Latin, changing the Muslim calendar to the Gregorian cal-
endar and changing Islamic canon law Sharia to civic law.
Gökalp's (1988) book, Main Principles of Turkishness,
facilitated the definition of a nation of Turks. When the
Ottoman Empire with its multiethnic structure was becoming
a nation state, Gökalp's sociological definition, that "citizens
of Turkey are considered Turks," established a practical
manner with which to resolve questions regarding the ethnic
origins of society and was applied by Mustafa Kemal when
declaring the Republic of Turkey.
Contrary to economically based sociological analysis of
social structure such as Marxism, Durkheim sociology is
widely accepted and followed in Turkey because of Ziya
Gökalp, who himself was an ideologist of the Order and
Progress Party, whose members changed the political system
of the country from a monarchy to a republic. The primary
slogan developed by Ziya Gökalp was the articulation of
three main concepts: "Islamization, Westernization and
Turkification." As a sociologist, he proposed an amalgama-
tion to solve the identity problems of the citizens of the new

Problems With Sociology Education in
Turkey on Its 100th Anniversary
Aytul Kasapoglu1
Abstract
Although sociology education began a century ago in Turkey, sociology is considered a scientific discipline rather than a
profession in which graduates can earn money. The primary aim of this article is to identify the essence of this problem
in sociology education based on students' and sociologists' views. To achieve the study objectives, a phenomenological
study based on standpoint theory was designed and conducted with 25 students and 20 working sociologists. The findings
reveal that sociology education is quite far removed from being considered a professional education. Theoretical courses
without field studies are not in accordance with the requirements of both the public and private sectors. Students and
sociologists are quite romantic regarding what sociology is and what sociologists do. Students mostly begin the study of
sociology involuntarily and without a clear understanding of the discipline. Sometimes students find themselves in a paradox
or dilemma: Although the knowledge and skills they have developed during their sociology education enable students to
express themselves effectively and understand social events more comprehensively, the risk of unemployment is a severe
threat. Even if they are employed, graduates are disappointed because they are not prepared to conduct the tasks that their
jobs demand. Students assess these activities as social work and thus inappropriate. To solve the problems of sociology as a
profession in society and as an academic field in the university, both problems must be clearly defined and programs must be
carefully reconfigured to meet the demands of both society and sociologists.

nation state by saying, "I am from the Turkish nation; I
belong to Western civilization as well as Islam." (Gökalp,
1970, 1988). When sociology education began in Turkey in
1914, the Ottoman Empire was certainly not a modern indus-
trial society that required sociology to solve its problems.
However, Ziya Gökalp considered Durkheim's sociology
and its communitarian approach appropriate for Turkey,
which was primarily traditional and patriarchal. Being a
communitarian instead of an individualist such as Durkheim
was politically preferable in Turkey and later garnered many
supporters as opposed to other sociology traditions such as
Prens Sabahattin's, who was a representative of Le Play's
sociology, which is more decentralized and individualistic
(Parla, 2006). The history of sociology in Turkey falls pri-
marily into two periods or stages. The first period was influ-
enced by Ziya Gökalp and Prens Sabahattin and was called
the constitutionalist period. The second period reached from
the Second World War to the present (Mardin, 1974; Tanyol,
1973).
According to Mardin (1983), the first period was more
political whereas the second period has primarily been based
on data collected from field studies conducted by universi-
ties. Mardin (1983, 1998) posited that those who saw them-
selves as responsible for saving the empire from collapse
were called Young Turks (Jon Turks); the Young Turks
approached issues in terms of a doctor­patient relationship,
acting as social physicians. In fact, at that time, developed
Western countries were also defining the Ottoman Empire as
a sick man. This first period of sociology was full of contro-
versy among intellectuals who defended progress as modern-
ists and the status quo as conservatives. The Young Turks
considered themselves accelerants, transforming society
from traditional to modern with the help of the positive sci-
ences; these intellectuals considered sociology their most
important tool. In fact, two political movements were com-
peting with one another and later developed as two different
sociological traditions in Turkey. Whereas one tradition
adopted the Le Play school's principles, the other tradition
adopted Durkheim sociology, both of which originated in
France (Dogan, 2006). During the Ottoman Empire, intel-
lectuals were strongly affected by France in terms of culture
and the social sciences whereas bureaucrats collaborated
with Germany to make military progress.
The Young Turks believed that translating sociology
books was quite important in changing the society from tra-
ditional to modern. Westernization was the primary target for
improving the Turkish society, and the Young Turks required
available prescriptions. Therefore, intellectuals began to
translate sociology books into the Ottoman language.
Sometimes the translators adapted the books to the condi-
tions of the Turkish society by interpretations (Parla, 2006).
Ziya Gökalp, who was the theoretical and ideological leader
of the Progress and Development Party, and the Young Turks
began presenting sociology lectures based on these trans-
lated books in 1914 at Istanbul University and began
publication of a sociology journal. However, at the end of the
First World War, Ziya Gökalp was fired by the invasion
forces who occupied Istanbul as the capital of the Ottoman
Empire and deported him to Malta/Cyprus as punishment in
1918. Later, professors such as Mehmet Izzet and Necmeddin
Sadak were unable to regain the same popularity as the first
established department of sociology in Turkey. However,
Mehmet Izzet is important as the author of the first sociology
textbook for secondary schools (Dever, 2014).
Another sociologist made significant contributions to
Turkey's history of thought following Ziya Gökalp at
Istanbul University. Himi Ziya Ulken studied human geogra-
phy and philosophy before joining the sociology department,
in which he was a professor of sociology between 1940 and
1950. His ideas were primarily Marxist although his philoso-
phy changed when he moved to Ankara to work in the
Faculty in Divinity in 1960. His book on refusing historical
materialism was the primary evidence indicating Ulken's
radical transformation.
Later, holistic (Durkheim) and particularistic (Weber)
views competed in different faculties of Istanbul University.
Thus, after the foundation years, sociology in Turkey became
quite enriched and proliferated by developing two schools.
Following Weber's tradition, Sabri Ulgener (1951/2006), a
member of the Faculty of Economics, wrote a book called
Moral World of Economic Disorganization. Because of this
study, he is referred to as Turkey's Weber, and his book is
considered a milestone of sociology in Turkey. This tradition
was continued by Ahmet Guner Sayar (2006), who was a stu-
dent of Ulgener.
During the late 1960s, there were Marxists (Sezer, 1979)
in addition to followers of Durkheim at the Istanbul
University Faculty of Letters who evaluated the social struc-
ture of Turkey from the perspective of the "Asian Type of
Production" and the "historical specificity" principle of
Marxism. These philosophies helped to explain why there
was a different infrastructure in Turkey in terms of a produc-
tion type of economy that did not result in the development
of a capitalist system.
It should also be noted that these two traditions of sociol-
ogy were both interested in the difference between Turkey's
socioeconomic structure and Western societies that had suc-
ceeded in shifting from traditional to modern or from agri-
cultural to industrial in general and/or from feudalism to
capitalism in Marxist terms. To achieve this aim by follow-
ing Weber, Ulgener (1951/2006) emphasized the importance
of thought and that the factors that determine individual
thought lead to the reproduction of traditionalism. Sezer
(1979, 1991a, 1991b) and Kemal Tahir (1992), who is one of
the most eminent Turkish novelists, studied the social struc-
ture of Turkey to show the uniqueness of the feudalism that
was peculiar to Turkey and Eastern despotic countries based
on the Asiatic Type of Production.
Unfortunately, after its foundation period, sociology again
found itself in crisis in 1947 during the Republican Period.
Kasapoglu 3
Turkey's first sociology department in the Republican era at
Ankara was closed when professors were accused of being
communists. Although the professors were not found guilty
and were freed, education in the department and sociology as
a discipline in Turkey were deeply affected. The expectations
of Turkish sociology, particularly in terms of proliferation,
could not be realized. Field-based studies on the social struc-
ture of Turkey were interrupted. More importantly, the insti-
tutionalization of sociology in Turkey failed because of the
political effects of the Second World War and Turkey's inter-
nal reflections on existing government policies. The
Department of Sociology in the Faculty of Letters was abol-
ished, and professors who were educated in the United States
such as Behice Boran, Niyazi Berkes, and their research
assistant, Fatma Takingol (Basaran); Muzaffer Sherif from
psychology; and Mediha Berkes from anthropology were all
fired (Kasapoglu, 1991). During their short academic lives at
Ankara (1939-1947), the journals Homeland and the World
(Yurt ve Dunya), published by Behice Boran and Niyazi
Berkes, and Steps (Adimlar), published by Behice Boran,
were important contributions in terms of "public sociology"
(Kasapoglu, 2011a).
During the planned period of Turkey beginning in the
1960s, the establishment of the State Planning Institution
was a milestone for sociologists. One of the students of
Behice Boran, whose name was Mubeccel Belik Kiray
(1964), conducted a study similar to Boran's study on the
social structure of a small town called Eregli to determine
socioeconomic changes because of industrialization.
However, those studies are mostly defined as apolitical as
well as quantitative, influenced by American sociology
because those new state institutions and universities pro-
vided scholarships for sociologists, particularly in American
universities (Kasapoglu, 1991, 2005; Odabas, 2009).
Other important events in sociology education were the
establishment of Middle East Technical University (1959),
Hacettepe University (1964), and Ege University (1977).
Unfortunately, Turkey experienced a military intervention in
1980, and the new Higher Education Law redesigned all dis-
ciplines, including sociology curricula. The process of pro-
liferation was certainly interrupted by imposing the identical
curriculum on all departments. The number of university and
sociology departments has increased and reached 104 by
2015.
From its inception, sociology in Turkey always had prob-
lems with the identity of the discipline. Because sociology
was politically preferred and considered a science, sociology
courses were added to secondary school curricula in 1929,
and students who studied sociology were sufficiently confi-
dent to at least teach in secondary or high schools. Until the
1990s, there were a limited number of sociology departments
in old universities, and their graduates were easily employed.
Because of Turkey's European Union Entrance project, the
number of universities increased, as did sociology depart-
ments. Furthermore, sociology departments in distance
education began to add 14,000 sociologists each year.
Currently, 19,000 students have studied sociology; however,
only 969 of them have been employed by the state since 2003
(Kasapoglu,2015). Therefore, the risk of unemployment for
sociologists, particularly by the state, is a serious problem for
both students and their parents.
As indicated by the American Sociological Association,
sociologists have three major alternatives to find employ-
ment after graduation. These areas are teaching, research,
and sociological practice (cited in Kasapoglu, 2015). The
majority of sociology graduates work as teachers in second-
ary schools, vocational schools, preparatory schools, and as
faculty in the universities of Turkey. In addition to sociology
departments, other disciplines such as law, business admin-
istration, education, social anthropology, divinity, social
work, medicine, and nursing require sociology courses and
hire sociologists. Although teaching was widely perceived
as satisfactory because teaching is secure and garners
respect in society, the teaching profession has changed, par-
ticularly for secondary and preparatory school teachers.
Corrosion observed in the teaching profession in general is
also true for secondary school sociology teachers (Ayalp,
2005).
Employment in the private or public sector as a researcher
is the second most common career option for sociologists.
However, if teachers want to be promoted or work under
more secure conditions, they should conduct research and
publish their results because "publish or perish" is the core
principle of academia. Therefore, teaching also requires
research skills. Finding a job on a research team in a research
institute, which can be governmental or nongovernmental at
the local or central level, is quite desirable for many sociolo-
gists in many countries, including Turkey. In fact, when soci-
ologists work as researchers in any field of expertise related
to the environment or health or human resources, they can
find themselves in some confusion regarding their identity,
identifying as a researcher rather than a sociologist.
Although the percentage of sociologists who are doing
applied or clinical sociology is quite limited in Turkey, the
majority of sociologists in developed countries earn their liv-
ing by applying their knowledge to solve social problems.
Although their work is quite close to research, sociology
extends beyond research activities and therefore is consid-
ered a sociological practice.
Policy-making and administration, other opportunities in
government, and opportunities in business are additional
options for sociological practice. Local and central adminis-
trations require sociologists when developing urban transfor-
mation, housing transformation, health, education, and law
enforcement policies. Certainly, sociologists work in these
fields with professionals such as engineers, architects, urban
planners, lawyers, and physicians. Sometimes sociologists
can be the head of a project, which occurred in the assess-
ment of Turkey's largest investment project of water in 1990.
Sociologists can also work in human resources, sales, and
4 SAGE Open
business administration departments as planners or analysts
although these positions are scarce when compared with the
number of sociologists in Turkey.
Research Problem
Although sociology education celebrates its 100th anniver-
sary in Turkey, sociology is not recognized as a profession in
the Turkish society but is considered an academic discipline
and career. Unfortunately, professors are unaware of the
problems of graduates and continue to apply curricula that
omit the skills and knowledge necessary to address the real
needs of society.
Objectives
Although the primary research is more comprehensive and
detailed, including quantitative survey results gleaned from a
representative sample of students from all over Turkey, this
article is limited to identifying answer to the following
questions:
a. What is the essence of the problems with sociology
education in Turkey?
b. When sociology and sociology education are consid-
ered, is there any difference between the views of stu-
dents and working sociologists?
c. What should be done to solve the existing problems of
sociology education?
Method
In this qualitative study, standpoint theory (Ramazanoglu &
Holland, 2002) was deemed appropriate based on phenome-
nological tradition; as proposed, standpoint theory is gener-
ally superior to positivist traditions because it is critical to
dichotomies and focuses on process and dynamism.
Standpoint theory identifies differences among similar sides
or components. In our case, although sociologists as students
and employed sociologists are different, they are in a con-
tinuum with one another. Comparisons are made between
them rather than with other disciplines or professionals. In
this study, it is assumed that there is no one unique type of
sociologist to compare with other professionals such as psy-
chologists or social workers; it is therefore assumed that
there are differences among sociologists, and comparisons
are made between sociologists who are of different statuses,
such as student and worker.
Participants
The study group comprised 25 students who are studying
sociology at various universities (Middle East Technical
University, Hacettepe University, Ankara University, Gazi
University, and Yildirim Beyazit University) and 20 sociolo-
gists who are working in several municipalities and ministries
in Ankara, the capital city of Turkey. Senior students who are
in their last year were intentionally selected because they are
presumed to be more experienced and knowledgeable regard-
ing the conditions and the problems of sociology education
and employment. Interviews were also conducted with soci-
ologists who have at least 5 years of work experience.
Therefore, "purposive" and "theoretical" sampling tech-
niques (Creswell, 1998) were used to achieve the study
objectives.
Data Analysis
The design of this qualitative research is based on principles
of the phenomenological tradition (Moustakas, 1994;
Creswell, 1998) consistent with Colaizzi's (1978) phenome-
nological principles. For example, first, recorded interviews
were listened to carefully before the interpretations were writ-
ten. Then, significant statements were determined and catego-
rized into negative and positive statements for comparison.
Meanings were also grouped into four thematic clusters that
were common to all of the participants' transcripts.
The data used in this article were part of a more compre-
hensive quantitative study supported by theAnkara University
Research Fund. The qualitative research was designed to sup-
port and validate quantitative data derived from a nationwide
survey comprising 684 students from 126 different universi-
ties located in different parts of Turkey. In this article, a short,
unstructured questionnaire was developed after applying the
results of the quantitative data. The open-ended questions
included "What is your definition of sociology?" "How did
you decide to study sociology?" "What is your experience
here in this department?" "What meaning does sociology
have in your life?" and "What do you feel about your future
after graduation?" The sociologists were asked similar ques-
tions when they were interviewed.
After obtaining their oral consent, face-to-face interviews
were conducted during data collection. Interviews lasted at
least half an hour, and most lasted approximately an hour. All
interviews were recorded with the participants' permission. As
a component of the research problem, researchers were careful
not to influence the interviewee's responses and were particu-
larly aware of setting aside all prejudgments by bracketing for-
mer experiences, as suggested by Husserl (1931). Interview
data were deciphered immediately by the researchers to ensure
that no important point was lost. The validity of the research
was ensured by reviewing the literature and bracketing past
experiences. Taking field notes, selecting an appropriate sam-
pling in accordance with the study purposes, and interviewing
untilreachingthesaturationpoint(receivingrepetitiveanswers)
are also worthy of mention (Meadows & Morse, 2001).
Findings
A total of 267 significant statements extracted from inter-
views with 25 students and 20 sociologists were quite com-
prehensive and complex. To present data in a reader friendly
Kasapoglu 5
form, some statements are presented in the appendix (see
Tables A1 to A4). A summary of significant statements
grouped in thematic clusters is presumed to render the find-
ings more understandable. In this section, the findings of the
phenomenological study are presented based first on com-
paring the thematic clusters of students' positive and nega-
tive statements (Tables 1 and 2), including their formulated
meanings, and then presenting the data obtained from work-
ing sociologists (Tables 3 and 4).
The four themes derived from the findings are the mean-
ing of sociology, sociology education, the effects of sociol-
ogy education and thoughts about the future. To reach the
essence of the problem, these four themes were used to com-
pare data gathered from students and working sociologists.
At first, it appeared crucial that significant negative state-
ments of both students and sociologists were longer and
more numerous. Although similar statements were deleted,
there were nevertheless many more significant negative
statements (183) than positive statements (84; see Tables A3
and A4 of the appendix).
The findings presented in Table 1 reveal that sociology
students have positive feelings regarding sociology because
students attribute a higher stature to sociology by saying that
sociology is more than a profession and that their lifestyle is
in harmony with sociology. Their satisfaction with the edu-
cation they receive is also consistent with their impressions
regarding sociology, and students reported that they had the
opportunity to go into the field to understand society.
Students also admitted that sociology education had changed
their personalities and that they are happy with these changes.
Students believe that they will find a job as a sociologist and
are thus quite optimistic about their futures.
Sociology students' negative significant statements, pre-
sented in Table 2, show that the status of sociology is unfortu-
nately not as high as expected. Like society in general, students
did not know much about sociology and lacked an understand-
ing of sociology when they began their studies. In fact, if their
scores had been higher, they would have preferred to study
psychology, which is considered a health profession, with spe-
cial departments in state hospitals and other related organiza-
tions in Turkey. Students also blamed sociology professors for
not being objective in their lectures and imposing their own
ideologies on students. Students were critical that their educa-
tion remained theoretical without allowing the transfer of their
knowledge and skills to the field. Because students do not
believe that they belong to either sociology or sociology edu-
cation, they isolate themselves from any type of interaction
that could result in changing their personalities or relation-
ships. Students also claim that because of their sociology edu-
cation, their relationships with their families are not as good as
in the past. Families worry about unemployment and blame
the students for not behaving like responsible adults. Families
think that at least by working hard and getting high scores, the
students can major or minor in psychology or public adminis-
tration to guarantee their futures.
Turkey's economic conditions are not good (Boratav,
2011), particularly when considering the unemployment rate
among the young. According to International Labour
Organization (ILO in 2011) data, the unemployment rate is
quite high and reached 24% among university graduates
(Kasapoglu, 2015). The findings in Table 3 show that some
sociologists expressed being happy because they are doing
useful things for society. They also supposed that their edu-
cation enriched them and prepared them for the work they
do. Their desire for a master's degree in sociology also shows
that they want to improve their knowledge and skills and that
they are optimistic about their future careers.
Although optimists exist, the majority of sociologists inter-
viewed reported negative perceptions regarding sociology as
presented in Table 4 and Table A4 (of the appendix). First, like
the students interviewed, the sociologists began to study with-
out consciously choosing this discipline.According to the soci-
ologists, the objectives of sociology curricula were limited to
academic sociology. Therefore, their expectations when they
started to work were unfortunately quite far from the condi-
tions they faced. They also noticed that the tasks they had to
perform required knowledge of the administrative system of
Turkey. The sociologists claimed that because they were not
familiar with the social structure of Turkey or the components
of its social institutions, they had to enhance their knowledge
with a master's degree in the field of public management. The
majority of sociologists in Turkey prefer to work in the public
sector as government officers with scheduled hours and job
security. These sociologists prefer not to go out in the field to

apply their profession, which requires working long hours in
risky conditions. Therefore, they are realistic when they admit
that they are alienated. Because of their training, they guard
against being perceived and treated as social workers. The soci-
ologists believe that sociology is superior to social work in
terms of the scientific nature of the discipline. However, they
are simultaneously impressed with social workers' job defini-
tions and salaries. In Turkey, psychologists and social workers
are considered health personnel, and they earn more money
than other staff who do similar work in the same office. Because
of this inequality, some sociologists began distance education
in social work to obtain the same status and salary as social
workers. All of these phenomena may be interpreted as a type
of the "corrosion of character" that was proposed by Sennet
(1998) to define the workers' dilemma. Here in Turkey, soci-
ologists are not considered to be sociologists either by them-
selves or by society. They are always pessimistic regarding
their future although they are employed.
Discussion
Sociology education and its problems have persisted for
years in Turkey (Coskun, 1991; Kasapoglu, Kavas, Kiliç,
Çinar, & Kilikbicen, 2014; Kasapoglu, Kaya, & Ecevit,
2009; Kocabas & Hanedar, 2013). From its inception in
Turkey, sociology has had identity problems. What sociol-
ogy is or what sociologists do remains unclear. Another
dimension of the identity problem is people who are not
educated in sociology but act as if they are sociologists in
society. For example, some social scientists and in particular
eminent politicians and journalists claim that they are soci-
ologists when they are talking on TV or writing for the
media. Although these pseudo-sociologists become popular
with the public, real sociologists react negatively. If these
pseudo-sociologists are considered sociologists, then the
real sociologists certainly are not. Sociologists also believe
that sociology cannot be as ignoble as nonsociologists cause
it to appear. All of these attitudes indicate that sociology has
severe identity problems; otherwise, other professionals in
the market would not play the role of sociologist.
Certainly, the status of sociology is not only problematic in
Turkey. Similar discussions have occurred in the United States
regarding whether sociology is a science and its scientific status

(Singleton, 1998). According to Turner and Turner (1990), who
published an institutional analysis of American sociology, a
"sharp division has arisen between those who are committed to
sociology as a science and those who remain sceptical and criti-
cal" (p. 7). During the late 1980s, the ASA prepared a report
called Task Force on Graduate Education (TAGGE) and several
articles published in the American Journal of Sociology written
by Collins (1986, 1987) and Denzin (1987). Whereas Denzin
was proclaiming the death of sociology, Collins examined soci-
ology as either a proscience or an antiscience. What is wrong
with sociology as a topic has also been discussed in special
forums (Cole, 1994). The primary discussions concerned what
academic sociology is or is not (Davis, 1994). These academics
concluded that there are no firm lines between legitimate aca-
demic and nonacademic sociology because of postmodernism,
humanistic sociology, and critical theory. Some other sociolo-
gists, such as Molotch (1994), proposed escaping the science
trap as a model. Sociology and other social sciences have all
been troubled by long discussions regarding the nature of
science, and some have suggested that it may be better to
assume, at least for sociology, that the discipline is an "intellec-
tual craftsmanship," as proposed by Mills (1959). Categorizing
the social sciences with a flexible definition of science rather
than a strict definition may be a solution. The majority of the
social sciences are far from applying the principles of natural
sciences, principles such as generalization and objectivity. In
addition, there have been many changes in the philosophy of
science and the epistemological convergence of natural and
social sciences as opposed to divergence, prompting new areas
of discussion (Kasapoglu, 1999; Wallerstein, 1998).
In Turkey, even senior professors are not completely clear
when they answer questions regarding the identity of sociol-
ogy. When these senior professors compare themselves with
members of other disciplines and professions, they notice that
sociology as a science is accepted and its education has con-
tinued for 100 years. Simultaneously, however, they believe
that they are only the teachers of sociology and do not con-
tribute to the scientific body of knowledge in terms of theory.
They only transfer existing theoretical knowledge of the dis-
cipline, assuming that the theoretical knowledge is universal.
Sociology students also complain that the subject they
study is not well known by society, causing them to feel a lack
of motivation to concentrate on their lessons. Even after a cer-
tain number of years spent in the sociology department, stu-
dents admit that they too are unable to define sociology, and
the majority of the time they try to avoid answering such
questions. The students who are not able to change reality
behave like conformists. Because the majority of the students
do not know a foreign language, they must read textbooks
only in translation, never in the original language. These
drawbacks have resulted in "mediocrity" (Sowell, 1993)
among sociology students; students accepted being average
and did not struggle to be superior or better. In fact, this medi-
ocrity is true for both students and professors because of the
existing system that reproduces it (Kasapoglu, 2011b).
Furthermore, a lack of original theories and concepts peculiar
to Turkey prevents the accuracy of both students' and profes-
sors' perceptions of reality. Rapid social changes in society
necessitate more rigorous and comprehensive studies, not an
easy task in existing market system conditions.
An examination of sociology education suggests that there
are many students who are not studying voluntarily. There are
also many students who began voluntarily but because of the
risk of unemployment, have lost their motivation. The majority
of students do not know where they will work and what will
they do when they graduate. Few positions in the private sector,
a lack of job security, fewer nongovernmental organizations,
and limited opportunities to continue their education in aca-
demia as research assistants push sociologists to work in the
public sector. A lack of sufficient departments in the state ren-
ders students disappointed and unhappy. In addition, there is no
guarantee that graduates will do sociological work; graduates
may have to do everything as an "everyman," which was dis-
cussed by Sennet (1998) in his study on corrosion of character.

Sociologists and Related Formulated Meanings in Four Thematic
Clusters.
Significant negative statements Formulated meanings
Regarding the meaning of sociology: "Uncertain risky field to
study at that time"
 "My decision to study sociology was unconscious."
 "Involuntarily, I studied sociology."
 "Sociology is not accepted as a field of expertise or a
profession of expertise."

are limited by academia."
 "We are educated as if we will be academics in the university,
which is not the case."
 "The job I do here is not related to academic sociology."
 "Sociology education must be more realistic."
 "I have graduated without knowing what I can do as a
professional."
 "The duration of field studies can be increased."
Regarding personal effects: "Corrosion of character"
 "I have never defined myself as a sociologist."
 "We are alienated from the society we live in."
 "I work here like a social worker."
Regarding the future: "Worried and pessimistic"
 "We are worried about our future because there is no
guarantee for tomorrow."
 "It is obvious without doing a master's in business
administration, we can't advance."
 "The most important problem for sociologists is employment."
 "I suppose there is not a sufficient number of jobs in the public
sector."
 "We should also have business administration skills when we
are working as sociologists."
 "The job description of a sociologist must be prepared like a
social worker's."
8 SAGE Open
The majority of sociologists who are working for the state
claimed that they are doing jobs unrelated to sociology.
The results of the phenomenological study revealed that
both students and sociologists are in a type of dilemma or
state of confusion regarding the status of sociology. Although
students and sociologists are certainly aware of the problems
in the discipline, particularly regarding the risk of unemploy-
ment, they nevertheless maintain positive perceptions about
their discipline. Although sociology is not known and
respected in Turkish society, students, regardless of their gen-
der and university, express being happy studying sociology.
To solve the problems of sociology requires applying the
tenets of sociology to sociology. If sociology solves its own
problems, certainly the discipline will be more successful
when practiced in other fields. Transferring Western theory
without adaptation, the gap between Western theory and local
practices, the lack of communication among sociologists, and
certainly identity problems in society are the main problems
of sociology in Turkey (Kasapoglu, 1991; Kasapoglu etal.,
2014).Although all of these problems affect sociology educa-
tion, the education in sociology also affects the quality of
sociology. However, existing central examination system for
entrance of higher education should also be revised.
Professors must realize that the intensive efforts that they
have exerted to transfer the existing knowledge contained in
many ordinary textbooks and neglecting to connect theory with
the nation's or society's needs represent an old-fashioned man-
ner of teaching. Curricula that do not prepare students to become
the professional sociologists should be revised. To fill the gaps
between academic and nonacademic sociology, professors
should facilitate "anticipatory socialization" (Bynum, Boyle,
Presnall, & Wemhaner, 1977) for their students; the skills and
ideas we learn from sociology can be applied to many subjects
and areas, from art and culture including pubs, museums, street
culture, games, and sports. According to Crawford (2012), a
new and changing world is always challenging us as sociolo-
gists to explore and research. It should also be noted this is not
peculiar only to sociology and can be interpreted for other disci-
plines such as urban planning or social anthropology.
