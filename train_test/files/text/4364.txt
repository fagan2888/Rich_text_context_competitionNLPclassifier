Do the mobile-rich get richer?
Internet use, travelling and
social differentiations in Finland

Abstract
This article investigates the daily travelling practices that are related to mobile-only,
fixed-only and combined mobile/fixed use of the Internet, and the social differentiations
that are related to these three ways of accessing the Internet. Survey data (N = 612)
collected from Finland in 2011 are analysed. The article shows that mobile-only Internet
use is not associated with particularly diverse or frequent daily travelling practices,
whereas combined mobile/fixed use is. Mobile-only Internet users are, in fact, in a
relatively disadvantaged position ­ compared with other users, they are more typically
unemployed and their household income is lower. The mobility of Internet access as
such does not guarantee a safe social position in society. Mobile Internet use must be
complemented with fixed use, which brings about more versatile and frequent travelling.
The finding suggests that the `mobile-rich get richer' when it comes to Internet use and
daily travelling practices.

Introduction
Among the key affordances of the Internet are that it enables physical distances to be
overcome and is increasingly mobile (Wellman et al., 2003). However, it is only recently
that the Internet has become truly portable. First of all, the mobility of the Internet has

followed from the spread of the mobile phone, under the auspices of which mobile
Internet connections have evolved and spread rapidly (Fortunati and Contarello, 2002;
Fortunati and Taipale, 2014). In particular, the smartphone has transformed the use of
Internet by making the Internet available to people on the move. Despite this great
affordance of mobility, studies from Finland and other European countries indicate that
a majority of smartphone users utilize only a small number of the functions on their
smartphones (Fortunati and Taipale, 2014; Sell et al., 2012). The Internet-enabled smart-
phone is clearly an under-utilized multi-functional device. Second, separate mobile solu-
tions, such as USB data sticks, SIM card slots in laptops and tablet personal computers
(PCs) have added substantially to the portability of the Internet. This category of solu-
tions also includes Wi-Fi hotspots, which allow access to the Internet when 3G or 4G
networks are not available or roaming costs are high.
The main research problem of this study pertains to these latter ways of connecting to
the Internet. The study investigates how mobile-only Internet use, when compared with
fixed-only and combined mobile/fixed Internet use, is related to daily travelling prac-
tices. Furthermore, the study clarifies the type of social differentiations that are related to
these three ways of accessing the Internet. The rationale for this study design is based on
two key observations. First, although there are a few studies on Internet use based on
mobile phones (e.g. Brown et al., 2013; Cheong and Park, 2005; Donner et al., 2001;
Okazaki, 2006), it is still unclear how people use other mobile ways (e.g. USB data
sticks) for connecting to the Internet, and how such use is socially differentiated when
compared with the use of fixed Internet connections. Second, it is also unclear whether
or not different methods of accessing the Internet are differently intertwined with peo-
ple's travelling practices. In this study, travelling practices are defined as forms of daily
spatial mobility. By daily spatial mobility, Kellerman (2012) means two-way movement
(e.g. journeys to and from work, school or shopping), rather than one-way movement
(e.g. change of residence), that takes place regularly (so this does not include, for exam-
ples, vacation journeys). Ordinary means of transportation, such as cars, buses, trains and
walking, are typically used for daily spatial mobility. Such ordinary two-way forms of
travelling are central to this study, which exploits a sociological theory of mobilities, as
presented by Urry (2000, 2007), to have a good grasp of the research problem.
In this article, Finland serves as an example country for investigating whether mobili-
ties, both various forms of Internet connection and daily travelling practices, accumulate
and reflect social differentiations between various socio-economic groups. The study by
DiMaggio et al. (2004) suggests that such socio-economic differences represent con-
straints that are reflected in the use of digital devices (as well as in travelling practices)
in developed countries and elsewhere. Previous similar studies consider countries such
as Armenia (Pearce and Rice, 2013) and the United States (Brown et al., 2013; Smith,
2012), while Finland represents a quite different country context. Finland has a high
level of gender equality and a relatively homogeneous population structure (e.g. in terms
of religion, race and language minorities), and its income differences are relatively low.
Although income equality has recently shown signs of growth, the redistributive tax and
welfare system has remained effective in maintaining a good material living standard
across the social strata (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
[OECD], 2010). Previous studies on the adoption and use of new information and
46 new media & society 18(1)
communication technologies (ICTs) in Finland have also reflected these relatively small
inequalities, as will be demonstrated later in this article.
It is against this backdrop that this article aims, first, to outline how different modes
of physical travelling are related to (1) mobile-only, (2) fixed-only and (3) combined
mobile/fixed Internet use. Second, the study aims to clarify whether these three methods
of connecting to the Internet are socially differentiated in Finland. In fact, while the
adoption of the Internet in general has received much scientific attention (e.g. Kiiski and
Pohjola, 2002; Rice and Katz, 2003), the adoption of mobile Internet use in particular has
largely been investigated (1) separately from fixed Internet use and (2) by focusing on
cognitive motivations for adoption rather than socio-economic factors (e.g. Kim and
Garrison, 2009; Shin 2007). The most relevant studies on social differentiation, in which
different ways of connecting to the Internet are studied side by side, have chiefly focused
on teenagers as a special group of Internet users (Brown et al., 2013), and on developing
countries (Pearce and Rice, 2013). Considering these limitations of previous studies, this
study adds to the body of literature by investigating nationally representative survey data
(N = 612) drawn from Finland in 2011.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. First, theoretical starting points for the
study will be presented. Then the article will show how previous studies have addressed
the relationship between travelling practices and Internet use, as well as social differen-
tiations concerning these mobilities. Based on these considerations, hypotheses will be
defined for the study. The data and methods will be introduced to the reader before the
results are presented. The article will end with discussion and conclusions.
Literature
Mobilities theory
This study is grounded on the mobilities paradigm, largely formulated by the British
sociologist John Urry (2000, 2007). This paradigm underlines the fact that the `social' is
not constituted only by dense, bodily, face-to-face interactions, but that travelling and
communication technologies also function as cement, binding together people who live
apart. The paradigm claims that different mobilities are tightly interconnected and inter-
dependent (Büscher and Urry, 2009: 102). Five mobility categories are typically pre-
sented: (1) physical travelling of people, (2) physical movement of objects, (3)
imaginative mobility (e.g. movement of images and ideas through means such as televi-
sion, radio and newspapers), (4) virtual mobility (real-time communication through the
Internet) and (5) person-to-person communication (e.g. through emails, mobile phones,
letters etc.). (For more background, see, for example, Larsen et al., 2006: 47­48; Urry,
2007).
Mobility scholars also argue that a wide and diverse arsenal of mobility tools is a key
asset in a modern networked life. Mobility tools contribute to the building of one's net-
working capacity, or so-called network capital (Elliot and Urry, 2010; Quan-Haase et al.,
2002; Wellman and Frank, 2001). At times, network capital has been viewed as a variant
of social capital, which emphasizes the role of personalized social networks that are
based on person-to-person communication (e.g. Quan-Haase et al., 2002; Wellman,
Taipale 47
2001; Wellman and Frank, 2001). At the same time, the literature from previous research
is clearly insufficient in terms of understanding how different ways of accessing the
Internet (e.g. mobile, fixed and combined) are connected to travelling practices, and
what kind of social inequalities are related to the different methods of accessing the
Internet (Taipale, 2014). This inadequacy is partly due to the qualitative and ethnographic
methodologies widely applied in mobility research, which have stressed the need for
researchers to follow and study movement up close (Büscher and Urry, 2009: 111­112),
without also underlining the need for a systematic and statistical modelling of the rela-
tionships between the various forms of mobility.
One way of understanding mobility-related inequalities is the Matthew effect approach.
The concept was originally used by Merton (1968), who argued that in science an emi-
nent scholar gains more credit than a comparatively younger researcher, even if their
contributions to science are basically the same. In a similar vein, Internet scholars have
argued that the Internet stimulates more usage among those with greater resources, skills
and know-how, whereas those whose resources are scarcer benefit less (e.g. Chen and
Wellman, 2005: 533; Pearce and Rice, 2013: 722). According to this theory, mobile-rich
people thus get richer and those with fewer mobility tools and less networking capital
remain disadvantaged (Hampton, 2010; Hargittai, 2003; Helsper, 2012). Among mobil-
ity scholars, this virtuous circle of mobilities is also acknowledged. For instance, Urry
(2007) writes that `There are then positive feedback mechanisms whereby the network
rich get richer and the network poor poorer, so producing greater social inequalities
between people' (p. 231). Nevertheless, attempts to model statistically whether or not
physical and digital means of mobility tend to accumulate for some individuals have so
far remained rare.
The interconnections between travelling and Internet use
Before the Internet, many communication technologies, such as the television and the
landline phone, had already occasionally been considered threats to travelling and meet-
ing other people in person (e.g. Putnam, 2000). When the Internet was introduced, it was
perceived as a vehicle to reduce travelling and travel-related risks, as it made it possible
to experience life at-a-distance (cf. Castells, 2001: 235; Gillespie and Richardson, 2000).
Concerns were raised that mobile communication technologies would replace traditional
forms of social interaction with others and make travelling redundant (Gergen, 2008:
301­302). Empirical research has, however, provided scant support for these views. It
has been argued, for instance, that Internet use may lead to less use of traditional media
but that Internet usage does not influence the amount of time spent on social activities
(Peng and Zhu, 2011). Others have firmly argued that Internet use adds to socializing and
travelling (Ishii, 2006; Wellman, 2001; Wellman et al., 2003).
In reality, the relationship between the Internet and travelling is complex. As
Mokhtarian (2009) argues, it is difficult to improve the Internet to reduce physical travel-
ling without using the same technology to increase travelling and make it a more pleasur-
able experience. In fact, studies from North America point out that Internet use
complements face-to-face interaction rather than functions as a substitute for it (Koku
et al., 2001). Mok et al. (2010) have also reported that the frequency of face-to-face
48 new media & society 18(1)
contacts did not really change from the 1970s until the first decade of the 21st century,
and that encountering others still entails physical travelling. Fortunati et al. (2013) have
found that, while the use of the mobile phone was connected to face-to-face (or body-to-
body; see Fortunati, 2005) sociability in Europe towards the end of the 1990s, by 2010,
it was mainly the Internet that was related to sociability. This indicates that technologies
that support meetings in person change over time. All in all, the literature shows that the
Internet promotes rather than reduces personal interactions.
Mobile communication studies have shown results similar to those concerning the
Internet: mobile communication either has a neutral effect on physical travelling or it
modifies travelling patterns and routes. For example, Ling and Haddon (2003) show that,
while calls made via fixed phone lines caused car trips to increase in number rather than
to decrease in number or be modified, calls from mobile phones have a more balanced
outcome. The effect of mobile calls was evenly balanced between causing, preventing
and changing car trips. In the same spirit, Ling and Donner (2009) later argued that
mobile communication technologies increase the efficacy of travelling by enabling a
flexible coordination of travel-related issues. In Sweden, Thulin and Vilhelmson (2007)
found that people who frequently use a mobile phone also travel and socialize with other
people face to face more often than those who use a mobile phone less frequently.
However, all these studies have focused on mobile phone use. Other devices that enable
one to access the Internet on the move have not been studied so thoroughly.
Based on the key theoretical proposition of mobility researchers and on the above
review of the somewhat diverse previous findings, the first three research hypotheses for
the study are defined. Using the theoretical idea of the Matthew effect, the following
hypotheses are framed to test whether the ways and amount of travelling gradually
increase as the ways of accessing the Internet become more mobile (the shift from fixed-
only to mobile-only) and numerous (the shift from mobile-only to combined mobile/
fixed use of the Internet).
Hypothesis 1 (H1). Fixed-only Internet use is associated with the least diverse and
frequent physical travelling practices.
H2. Mobile-only Internet use is connected with relatively diverse and frequent physi-
cal travelling practices.
H3. Combined mobile/fixed Internet use is associated with the most diverse physical
travelling practices.
Social differentiation and Internet usage
The second aim of the study is geared toward analysing whether or not ways of accessing
the Internet are socially differentiated in Finland and, if so, whether the differentiations
can be understood using the idea of the Matthew effect. Two main lines of research can
be identified from previous studies that have analysed the socially differentiated use of
the Internet by statistical means. First, the adoption and non-adoption of the Internet
have been investigated with the purpose of understanding digital gaps within and between
countries. The diffusion theories (e.g. Rogers, 1983) and uses and gratification theories
(e.g. Katz et al., 1973­1974) have been widely applied in these inquiries. Gaps have been
Taipale 49
detected in relation to both technology adoption and patterns of use (e.g. Brown et al.,
2013; Hargittai, 2003; Katz and Rice, 2002; Pearce and Rice, 2013; Rice and Katz,
2003). Although these studies on the socially differentiated use of the Internet have pro-
vided many important results, they have not elaborated on the different ways in which
different Internet users access the Internet.
Second, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and similar approaches have been
employed to understand the take-up of the Internet, both wired and wireless (e.g. Cheong
and Park, 2005; Kim and Garrison, 2009; Shin, 2007). These studies have in common
that they reduce Internet adoption to the level of cognitive processes. Internet adoption is
measured by using indicators such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and
behavioural intentions towards the technology being studied. Some studies have extended
the TAM to cover predictors that are seen as peculiar to mobile Internet use (e.g. per-
ceived access barriers, Portera and Donthub, 2006), perceived ubiquity and perceived
reachability (Kim and Garrison, 2009) and cognitive absorption (Saad and Bahli, 2005).
All in all, TAM research has made only a little effort to comprehend the role of socio-
demographics in the adoption of wireless communication technologies.
The TAM directs the focus of research to the motivational aspects of adoption, not to
actual use. As such, the TAM clearly serves the purposes of consumer and business stud-
ies, which provide information on the appropriate targets for new technologies and ser-
vices when they are introduced to the market. The limits of this approach become evident
when the technology under investigation becomes extremely widespread, which is the
case for Internet use in many countries. For example, in Finland the use of the Internet
could only increase among people aged 65­74 years between 2011 and 2012 (Statistics
Finland, 2012). For this reason, it makes increasingly good sense to explore how the
actual patterns of Internet use are differentiated among users and, as this study does, to
analyse more specifically whether modes of accessing the Internet differentiate users and
their travelling practices.
In fact, there is increasing awareness that social differentiation, which ultimately
means either social inclusion or social exclusion, also includes `spatial' and `mobility'
aspects (Cass et al., 2005; Kenyon et al., 2002). There are thus good reasons to think that
the portability of the Internet could also be a socially differentiating factor. As the core
functions of social life (family, work, leisure time, etc.) are spatially dispersed in today's
industrialized societies, accessing a variety of activities, goods and social relationships
progressively takes place through communication technologies, such as the Internet. If
people are categorically excluded from these new means of mobility, they face the risk
of becoming socially excluded. Hence, it is important to have a better understanding of
whether the digital exclusion that follows from the rich-get-richer cycle (the Matthew
effect) reflects offline exclusion and restricts physical travelling (Helsper, 2012).
Studies from the United States show that mobile devices are increasingly used to
access the Internet, yet they still clearly differentiate between socio-demographic groups
of people. More than half of all Americans (55%) reported that they had used a mobile
phone to access the Internet in 2012 (Smith, 2012). Of these people, 31% had used their
mobile phones as the primary way of accessing the Internet. Brown et al. (2013) have
further argued that US teenagers living in low-income families use their mobile phones
for accessing the Internet more frequently than their more affluent counterparts. For
50 new media & society 18(1)
these teenagers, mobile Internet access offers a way to bridge a `digital gap' even if their
financial resources are constrained (see also Donner et al., 2001). In Brown et al.'s (2013)
study, however, only mobile Internet users were investigated, and they were not com-
pared with other groups of Internet users. The study by Pearce and Rice (2013) is one of
the few that makes comparisons between mobile-based and fixed PC-based Internet
users. These authors found that Armenians who mostly use a mobile phone to access the
Internet are younger than those using a PC or both a PC and a mobile phone to access the
Internet. Armenian PC-based and combined mobile/PC-based Internet users were more
likely to have higher education, to have better economic standing and to live in towns
than mobile Internet users.
In Finland, only a handful of studies have tried to investigate social differentiations in
accessing and using ICTs. The studies carried out show that socio-economic differences
concerning ICT evened out between 1999 and 2004 (Räsänen, 2008). The statistics show
that there is no longer any room for growth in Internet use as a whole in Finland (Statistics
Finland, 2012). This finding indicates that accessing the Internet by the most common
means, such as dial up, asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) or cable, which allow
the fixed use of the Internet, is perhaps no longer socially differentiated in Finland. Based
on this knowledge, the following hypothesis is defined for the study:
H4. Fixed-only Internet users are found evenly in all different socio-demographic
groups.
Accessing the Internet using mobile phones and other mobile devices (e.g. laptops
and tablet computers) is rapidly increasing in Finland, in the same way as in the United
States (e.g. Smith, 2012). According to Statistics Finland (2012), men more than women,
and those under 45 years of age more than older people, use mobile Internet access in
Finland. Taipale (2014) has shown that the use of small transportable digital tools in
Finland is associated with male gender, young age and being a student, whereas income
is not a predicting factor and area of residence (whether urban or not) is only a predicting
factor to a small extent. More generally, there is evidence that between 1999 and 2004,
income and education lost their predictive capacity in Finland for the perceived impor-
tance of mobile phones, PCs, and the Internet (Räsänen, 2008). This can be explained by
looking at the reduction in the prices of new technologies, but is also likely to relate to
the relatively small income inequality and high material living standard of Finland com-
pared to other countries worldwide (OECD, 2010). This overall picture contrasts with
recent studies from Armenia and the United States in which it was found that mobile use
of the Internet is related to low income (Brown et al., 2013; Pearce and Rice, 2013).
Based on this country-specific knowledge, the following hypothesis can be defined:
H5. Mobile-only Internet use is related to male gender, young age and being a student,
while other socio-economic factors are weakly connected or not connected at all.
Due to the lack of knowledge about the number of Internet connections in Finland, the
last hypothesis is the most difficult to formulate. Although the use of basic new ICT is no
longer strongly related to income, official statistics show that the total number of Internet
Taipale 51
connections has increased along with household income in Finland (Statistics Finland,
2013). Nevertheless, people living in the region of the capital have, on average, more
Internet connections (three or more) than people living in other major cities, towns and
villages. There is also evidence that the accumulation of Internet-related technologies in
Finland, such as the parallel use of an Internet connection and an additional wireless
network in the home, is related to high income and to living in an urban area (Statistics
Finland, 2012). Thus, the following hypothesis is defined:
H6. The combined mobile/fixed use of the Internet is associated with high income and
urban places of residence, while other socio-economic factors are weakly connected
or not connected at all.
Finally, the ways of connecting to the Internet are not only related to demographic or
socio-economic factors. A mobile and a fixed connection also have different affordances,
such as functions, attributes and physical properties, that affect their usability. Pearce and
Rice (2013) show that, while PC-based Internet allows a larger display and a complete
keyboard, mobile-based Internet might require more compromises in terms of usability
and functionality. The affordance of mobility is the most evident. While a fixed Internet
connection allows mobility only at the communicative level, a mobile Internet con-
nection also means that the device is portable. The advantages of mobile Internet
connections have also affected their popularity (Finnish Communication Regulatory
Authority, 2013). In Finland, the number of mobile Internet subscriptions first exceeded
the number of fixed subscriptions in around 2011 (FinCom, 2014).
Data and methods
Data
The data (N = 612) were collected in Finland in May and June 2011, using a structured
postal survey. The Population Register Centre of Finland carried out the nationally rep-
resentative sampling. The sampling frame consisted of Finnish-speaking citizens aged
between 15 and 65 years. The survey was pre-tested with 10 individuals. The data were
weighted to correct for the skewed gender and age distributions that resulted from the
higher non-response rates of men aged between 25 and 34 years and women aged
between 35 and 44 years when compared with other groups. A response rate of 24.4%
was reached without reminders. The subsample of Internet users (n = 475) drawn from
these data was used in the analysis. The design of the questionnaire benefited mainly
from two earlier survey studies, the first conducted in five European countries (Fortunati,
1998) and the second in the United States (Department of Communication Studies,
University of Michigan, 2006).
Measurements
The dependent variable indicating the way a respondent accessed the Internet was based
on the following question: `Which of the following do you use at least sometimes to
52 new media & society 18(1)
connect to the Internet from home?' The answer choices were (1) fixed broadband
(ADSL, cable, fibre, etc.), (2) mobile Internet connection (USB data stick, etc.) and (3)
dial up. The answers were then recoded into (1) mobile-only (n = 87, 18.3%), (2) fixed-
only (n = 231, 48.6%) and (3) combined mobile/fixed (n = 158, 33.3%) Internet use.
Independent variables measuring daily travelling practices were derived from the
question: `How often do you use the following types of transport for any kind of jour-
ney?' (Stradling, 2003). The following modalities were presented: car driver, car pas-
senger, motorbike, bus, train, taxi, bicycle and on foot (at least 10 minutes). The answer
choices were (1) most days, (2) once or twice a week, (3) about once a fortnight, (4)
about once a month, (5) several times a year, (6) about once a year or less and (7) never.
The answer choices were recoded into two: `at least once or twice a week' (answer
choices 1 and 2) and `less frequently' (choices 3­7).
Socio-demographic variables were chosen according to the relevance shown by previ-
ous research. Gender was measured with fixed categories, `Male'and `Female'. Age was
determined by asking for the respondent's year of birth. Years were recoded into three
categories (17 years or under; 18­44 years; and 45+ years) to ensure a sufficient number
of responses in each category. Education level was measured by using the International
Standard Classification of Education of 1997 (ISCED). Three categories were con-
structed for the study: low (ISCED levels 1­2), middle (ISCED levels 3, 4 and 5b) and
high education (ISCED levels 5a and 6). The indicator for main economic activity
included the following answer choices: employee, housewife/husband, unemployed,
pensioner and student. The level of urbanization was measured through the respondents'
estimate of the size of the place in which they lived. Three distinct categories were cre-
ated, as outlined by the OECD: essentially rural (less than 5000 inhabitants), relatively
rural (5001­100,000 inhabitants) and essentially urban (more than 100,000 inhabitants).
Annual household income was measured by eight answer categories ranging from `Less
than 20,000 Euros' to `More than 80,000 Euros'.
Methods
Both descriptive and multivariate statistics are employed. The socio-demographic
profiles of Internet users and their travelling practices are explored by using cross-
tabulations with the chi-squared test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Logistic regres-
sionanalyses(LRAs)areusedtotesthowdailytravellingpracticesandsocio-demographic
factors are associated with the different ways of accessing the Internet. Nagelkerke sta-
tistics are applied to identify the overall proportion of the variance explained by the
model, and the total percentages of correctly predicted cases are supplied (Tabachnick
and Fidell, 2007: 459­461, 491).
Results
This section begins with descriptions of the main characteristics of mobile-only, fixed-
only and combined mobile/fixed Internet users. In Table 1, each of these Internet user
groups is compared with `All other users', one at a time (descriptive statistics for `All
other users' are not presented in Tables 1 and 2). Table 1 shows that people who access
Taipale 53
the Internet via fixed means only do not differ from other Internet users regarding any of
the studied characteristics. By contrast, the group of mobile-only Internet users contains
a higher proportion of women (70.1%) and a lower proportion of men (29.9%) than other
Internet users. Mobile-only Internet users more often have a medium level education,
and are more typically unemployed than other Internet users. The average household
income of mobile-only Internet users is also lower than the average income of other
Internet users. Regarding the background characteristics of those who access the Internet
by means of both fixed and mobile connections, Table 1 shows that they are often young
and students. It is characteristic of these Internet users that they live in essentially urban
areas and in households with high income.

Table 2 presents descriptive information on how frequently and by what means
Internet users, using the different ways of accessing the Internet, travel physically.Again,
fixed-only Internet users do not statistically differ from other users with regard to any of
the studied means of transport. Mobile-only users, on the other hand, drive a car less
frequently and use the bus more regularly than other users. Those who access the Internet
by using both wireless and wired connections can be labelled private motorists. More
than three-quarters of these Internet users drive a car at least once or twice a week. Some
travelling practices are so infrequent among these three categories of Internet users that
they must be dropped from further multivariate analyses. These cells are marked with
asterisks in Table 2.
After this descriptive analysis, three logistic regression models were executed to test
the hypotheses. The models are presented in Table 3. The predictors of travelling with
small frequencies were dropped from the analysis. Nagelkerke R2 for the fixed-only
Internet use model was .068, indicating that the model explains only a small part of the
total variance. The same R2 for the mobile-only method was .126, and for the mixed
Internet access method it was .176. The percentages of correctly predicted cases were
60%, 87% and 76%, respectively.
The analysis does not provide support for H1, which claims that fixed-only Internet
use is associated with the least diverse and least frequent physical travelling practices.
Fixed-only users do not differ from others, except that they are less frequently car pas-
sengers. The statistical model also hints that they are likely to walk and travel by train

less frequently than others, but these findings are significant only at the .10 level. In
addition, the model for mobile-only Internet users does not provide support for H2, that
mobile-only Internet use would be connected to relatively diverse and frequent physical
travelling practices. The only mode of travelling that is used more frequently by mobile-
only users compared with other users is the bus, but this is also significant only at the .10
level. Hence, this hypothesis is also rejected.
H3 posited that people who access the Internet using both mobile and fixed connec-
tions would also have more diverse and frequent travelling practices. The right-hand

column of Table 1 reveals that this hypothesis can be confirmed. These Internet users not
only drive a car and travel as a car passenger more often than others, but they also travel
by train and walk more habitually than all other users. As this finding reveals, the strong
accumulation of mobilities for those who use both mobile and fixed ways of connecting
the Internet, it also provides support for the Matthew effect of mobilities.
Hypotheses H4, H5 and H6 addressed the issue of social differentiation in ways of
accessing the Internet. The analysis provides strong support for H4, which proposed that
fixed-only Internet users include people evenly from all socio-economic groups. There is
no social differentiation between fixed-only and other Internet users as far as the socio-
demographic variables used in this research are considered. Thus, H4 can be accepted.
H5 proposed that mobile-only Internet users would be male, young and students, which
would be a sign of more notable social differentiations in Internet access. In this respect,
the results are somewhat counter-intuitive. First, in this model, gender is not a significant
predictor, indicating no statistically significant gender differences. Previous research
indicates that the gendered patterns of mobile communication technology use may relate
more to differences between various family types and woman's role within these families
(Fortunati and Taipale, 2012). Second, young age is also not connected with mobile-only
use, and mobile-only users are less likely to be students than to be employed. Instead, the
analysis shows that mobile-only users are 4.8 times more likely to be unemployed than
to be workers (being a worker serves as a reference category in the model). Third, what
was less expected is that mobile-only users live in families with a lower household
income than those who access the Internet by using other methods. H5 is thus rejected.
H6 suggested that people accessing the Internet through both a mobile and a fixed
connection have a higher income and live in urban areas, and are hence in a relatively
secure position in society. The regression analysis clearly confirms only that the com-
bined mobile/fixed Internet users live in essentially urban areas, while income is not
associated with this combined method of accessing the Internet. In addition, the analysis
shows that the combined mobile/fixed Internet users could be more typically men than
women, as well as more commonly 17 years of age or under 45 years of age or older. It
follows from this that they are also more typically students than employees. H6 is thus
only partly confirmed. The combined mobile/fixed Internet users are perhaps not wealthy
and in a secure social position in classical terms, but they can be considered among the
new vanguard of mobile-rich people (Fortunati and Taipale, 2014).
Discussion and conclusion
The aim of this study was to investigate, first, which daily travelling practices are related
to mobile-only, fixed-only and combined mobile/fixed use of the Internet, and second,
what kinds of social differentiations are related to these three methods of accessing the
Internet.
Regarding the first aim, the results clearly show that the modes of physical travelling
used are no more diverse among mobile-only Internet users than they are among fixed-
only Internet users, although the theory of mobilities would suggest that the portability
afforded by a mobile Internet connection should be reflected in a more lively and mobile
lifestyle. In fact, these two methods of accessing the Internet are not strongly intertwined
Taipale 57
with any of the forms of daily travel in the study. More interestingly, the results reveal
that it is only when mobile Internet use is combined with use from fixed locations that
people begin to utilize multiple modes of physical travelling. This suggests that it is the
combined mobile/fixed Internet use, not the use of mobile Internet alone, that adds to
widely interconnected and complex mobility systems and network capital. This intercon-
nectedness thesis is a much-discussed topic in the theoretical and qualitative literature
(e.g. Elliot and Urry, 2010; Urry, 2002, 2007), and this result provides support for it by
utilizing nationally representative quantitative data.
The same results also make apparent the Matthew effect of mobilities. While mobile-
only Internet use as such is not enough to translate into a mobile-rich lifestyle, when
taken together with the use of fixed Internet access, it facilitates mobile ways in everyday
life. Although this study cannot provide one solid explanation for this observation, one
answer might deal with the different affordances of fixed and mobile Internet use. A
fixed connection is usually faster and more reliable, and such Internet use is also typi-
cally supported by hardware with a higher specification, such as a large screen and com-
plete keyboard, which allows full-scale utilization of the Internet (Pearce and Rice,
2013). These affordances of a fixed, and especially a PC-based, Internet connection may
better serve the need of those planning a route and making travel arrangements in advance
(e.g. printing out maps and downloading travel music). Furthermore, these results sup-
port the previous findings that mobile communication adds to rather than substitutes for
immediate ways of interacting (e.g. Koku et al., 2001; Mok et al., 2010).
In response to the second aim, the study shows that mobile-only Internet users, in
contrast to what was hypothesized, belong to a socio-economically less advantageous
part of society in Finland. This result appears surprising as income differences in general
have lost their relevance as the predictors of basic ICT use from Finland (e.g. Räsänen,
2008; Taipale, 2014). Hence, this result is more in line with previous research from the
United States (Brown et al., 2013) and Armenia (Pearce and Rice, 2013), societies that,
in terms of their social, economic and cultural structures, are different to Finland. In
these other two countries, Internet use based on a mobile phone is largely related to low
income. This similarity in results, irrespective of the fact that mobile Internet was con-
ceptualized and measured differently in all the studies, can be seen as an indication of a
more international phenomenon that deserves more scholarly attention.
The results also revealed socio-economic factors that differentiate between combined
mobile/fixed and other Internet users. It is young people, men, students and those living
in urban areas, who are most likely to utilize both mobile and fixed ways of accessing the
Internet in Finland. Considering that daily travelling practices were also most diverse
among this group, it appears that various means of mobility accumulate for this rather
well-defined group of Internet users. Although the Matthew effect proved to be valid
here, it is worth reminding that the combined fixed/mobile use was not associated with
household income. These Internet users do not have higher household income than other
users, but their average income does not prevent them from using a wide array of both
physical and digital mobilities. In this sense, high income is not a strong precondition for
extensive mobility in Finland.
The implications of these findings for the theory are twofold. First, the study clearly
provides reasons to think that the mere possibility of digital mobile connectivity through
58 new media & society 18(1)
mobile-only Internet is not a sufficient key to success in increasingly mobile and technol-
ogy-saturated societies. Even in developed countries like Finland, mobile-only Internet
presents relatively constricted possibilities for going online. Second, the study provides
support for the Matthew effect on mobilities, although only if one specifies that it is not
mobile-only Internet use alone but mobile Internet use accompanied with fixed Internet
use that leads to the accumulation of mobilities.
Besides the fact that this article deals with only one country, the study also has another
limitation that is worth discussing. It is not clear whether mobile-only users really go
online if they utilize, say, a USB data stick. It is likely that a certain proportion of them
use a data stick to connect their fixed desktop computer to the Internet, and use it only
occasionally with their laptop or other mobile device. However, even if not continuously
utilized, the possibility of accessing the Internet on the move is an untapped resource that
can be exploited when the need arises. Thus, a more careful study of why people pur-
chase USB data sticks and similar products (whether due to their transportability, low
price or the possibility of tethering the stick to many devices) would help us to specify
further how mobile Internet use is embedded in mobile lifestyle and daily travelling
practices.
