Abstract
We analyzed China's current use of and microbial resistance to antibiotics, and possible means of
reducing antimicrobial resistance. Interventions like executive orders within clinical settings and
educational approach with vertical approaches rather than an integrated strategy to curb the use of
antimicrobials remain limited. An underlying problem is the system of incentives that has resulted in
the intensification of inappropriate use by health professionals and patients. There is an urgent need to
explore the relationship between financial and non-financial incentives for providers and patients, to
eliminate inappropriate incentives. China's national health reforms have created an opportunity to
contain inappropriate use of antibiotics through more comprehensive and integrated strategies.
Containment of microbial resistance may be achieved by strengthening surveillance at national,
regional and hospital levels; eliminating detrimental incentives within the health system; and changing
prescribing behaviors to a wider health systems approach, to achieve long-term, equitable and
sustainable results and coordinate stakeholders' actions through transparent sharing of information.

Introduction
On April 30, 2014, the World Health
Organization (WHO) released its first sur-
veillance report on antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) in 114 countries.1 According to the

report, resistance to a wide range of anti-
infective agents is a worldwide public health
threat that continues to grow, and its preva-
lence is closely related to the overuse of
antibiotics. This is of particular concern in
the developing world, where bacterial infec-
tion remains one of the major precursors of
disease. There, antimicrobial agents play a
critical role in healthcare; thus, the increas-
ing rates of AMR pose a serious threat to
infection control. Overprescription of anti-
microbials not only wastes limited health
resources but also creates substantial finan-
cial burdens and poor health outcomes for
both individuals and countries. Because
China's population accounts for one-fifth
of the world's population, its efforts and
contributions to controlling AMR are crit-
ical to overall global health.
Antimicrobial resistance in China
From 1999 and 2001, the mean prevalence of
microbial resistance among hospital-acquired
infections in China reached 41% (range,
23%­77%), and community-acquired infec-
tions rose to 26% (range, 15%­39%).2 This,
coupled with China's high prevalence of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), has created a major healthcare
problem. In fact, from 2006 to 2010, the
isolation rate of MRSA in clinical settings
was between 55% and 63%, with resistance
rates at tertiary hospitals in large cities higher
than those in lower-level hospitals. The
CHINET AMR surveillance network
reported that in these tertiary hospitals, the
average MRSA isolation rate ranged from
29.1% to 74.2% in 2014, with an average of
44.6%. There are also significant geograph-
ical differences reported across China. For
example, eastern China has the highest preva-
lence of MRSA at 76.9%, and the prevalence
in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou are higher than those of smaller
cities.3­4 It has been reported that 32.7% of S.
aureus isolated from pediatric patients is
MRSA, which is about half that seen in
adult patients.5
Moreover, MRSA's antimicrobial resist-
ance spectrum is broad, with resistance rates
of up to 50% for macrolides, clindamycin,
aminoglycosides and quinolones.6,7 Among
gram-negative bacteria, resistance rates of
non-fermentative bacteria were the lowest.
The resistance rates of Pseudomonas,
Acinetobacter and Stenotrophornonas to cefo-
perazone/sulbactam were 28.86%, 18.53%
and 20.85%, respectively. Resistance rates of
Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter to imipenem
were 33.81% and 22.86%.8 Since the initial
reports of the 1990s, and particularly since
2000, extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase
(ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have
spread rapidly across China. The prevalence
of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli strains
varies across regions. Even carbapenems,
once regarded the treatment of last resort
against serious gram-negative bacterial infec-
tions, have begun to lose efficacy as carbape-
nem-resistant bacteria emerge and quickly
spread.
The resistance rates of nosocomial infec-
tions are on the rise, and most are multidrug
resistant. Antimicrobial agents with enzyme
inhibitors are more sensitive than non-
enzyme inhibitors. Resistance has a tendency
to increase, especially in Acinetobacter bau-
mannii and to third-generation cephalo-
sporins (Table 1).
Overall resistance rates have remained
stable since 2011 when the Chinese govern-
ment initiated nationwide interventions
to reduce the overuse of antimicrobials.
However, resistance to carbapenems con-
tinues to increase rapidly.
Antimicrobial use in China
The increasing prevalence of AMR is closely
related to the overuse of antimicrobial
agents. As Figure 1 shows, since the early
2000s, total pharmaceutical expenditure
(TPE) in China has been between 40% and

50% of the national total health expenditure
(THE).9,10 During the period 2000­2013,
the TPE surged even though the consumer
price index remained stable. In 2006, TPE
reached 43.5%, much higher than the
median in low-income countries (29.5%)
and twice the global median (23.1%).
Thirty to fifty percent of the medicines
consumed in hospitals are antimicrobial
agents, and around 70% of inpatients are
treated with antimicrobials. China's con-
sumption of antimicrobials and antimicro-
bial infusions per capita is far higher than
that of high income countries (HICs), and
the level of inappropriate use of medicines is
even higher than that of some low-income
countries.11 The situation in primary care is
even more challenging. In 2008, 57% of
prescriptions from primary care facilities
included antimicrobials, and 39% included
antimicrobial infusions; the average number
of medicines per prescription was 3.1.12
These numbers exceed the global medians
obtained by the 1990­2009 WHO survey
of primary care facilities worldwide. The
survey looked at high-, upper and lower
middle-, and low-income countries to
determine the median proportions of pre-
scriptions for antimicrobials and infusions,
as well as the average number of medicines
per prescription. The medians of prescrip-
tions for antimicrobials in these countries
were 38.2%, 42.8% and 48.7%, respectively.
For infusions and average number of medi-
cines per prescription, these proportions
were 11%, 15% and 23.2% and 2.3, 2.6
and 2.5, respectively.13 By comparison,
China's pharmaceutical expenditures are
exorbitant, and patients bear much of the
financial burden. For example, the 2011
THE per capita in China represents USD
265 of purchasing power parity, less than
both the global median (USD 442) and the
global average (USD 899). This figure is
only one-third of the average in upper-
middle-income countries (USD 830) and
6% of the average in HICs (USD 4,246).14
Despite these financial disparities, annual
antibiotic consumption per person in China
was about 138 g, which is 10 times that of the
United States.15 In 2006, China produced an
estimated 210,000 tons of antibiotics, of
which only 30,000 tons were exported; the
remaining 180,000 tons were consumed

domestically. Many studies have also
demonstrated that Chinese hospitals
prescribe antibiotics at extremely high rates
and that those most commonly used for
inpatient care are broad-spectrum
antibiotics.5,16­19
Antibiotics have been less frequently
prescribed in Chinese hospitals since 2008
owing to continued government efforts to
strengthen their regulation, especially the
2011 nationwide initiative to reduce anti-
biotics use. The level of total consumption
of antibiotics, measured as defined daily
dose (DDD), among inpatients has dropped
from a maximum of 910 DDD/1,000 patient
days in 2008 to 473 DDD/1,000 patient days
in 2012. However, 50% of hospitalized
patients were still given antibiotics in 2012,
the majority of whom received broad-
spectrum antibiotics. However, the propor-
tion of penicillins (Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical (ATC) Classification System code
J01C), which has continuously decreased
since 2008, was only 11%.20
As mentioned above, the inappropriate
use of medicines wastes limited health
resources. This not only places a huge finan-
cial burden on the government, society and
individuals but also carries certain health
risks.15 In 2005, a study entitled Public
Security Concerns of Irrational Use of
Antibiotics looked at several possible out-
comes resulting from the aforementioned
waste. The study estimated that the costs
for additional hospital medicines were CNY
21.8 billion (USD 2.7 billion, exchange rate-
¼ 8.1) and those for additional hospitaliza-
tions were CNY 42.0 billion (USD 5.2
billion). Further, the additional pharmaceut-
ical and hospitalization costs resulting from
drug resistance were CNY 3.7 billion (USD
0.5 billion) and 1.3 billion (USD 0.2 billion),
respectively. In that study, after adjusting for
multiple factors, the hospitalization costs for
patients with resistant infections were 1.5
times those of patients with antibiotic-sensi-
tive (non-resistant) infections. Based on the
actual mortality rate for patients with resist-
ant bacterial infections (11.7%) and the
average mortality rate for those with general
infections (5.4%), the additional deaths
attributable to AMR cost approximately
CNY 489,000 per year for the country as a
whole. In addition, the loss in productivity is
estimated at CNY 4.7 billion (USD 0.6
billion) and the annual medical costs asso-
ciated with drug reactions owing to AMR are
estimated at CNY 1.9­9.1 billion (USD 0.2­
1.1 billion). These costs would tax the
healthcare budgets of even the wealthiest
countries,
Current policies to improve
antibiotics prescription
and reduce antimicrobial
resistance
In China, two main government agencies
regulate the use of antibiotics: the China
Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) is
responsible for registering, producing and
distributing medicines; and the National
Health and Family Planning Commission
(NHFPC) oversees their clinical use, in
addition to pharmacies and infection con-
trol in health facilities. To encourage the
appropriate use of medicines, these agencies
have implemented a series of regulations and
strategies, which include requesting retail
pharmacies to sell antimicrobials with
prescriptions in 200321 and developing clin-
ical pathways, standard treatment guidelines
and clinical use guidelines for antibiotics
and other medicines in 2004.22 National
antimicrobial clinical use and resistance
surveillance networks were created in 2005
to collect, analyze and report routine data
from hospitals.23 Prescriptions were for-
mally regulated in 2007,24 and pharmacy
administration in health facilities was
further strengthened in 2011.25 A national
medicines use surveillance network (for
general medicines, not specifically for
1772 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
antimicrobials) was set up in 2009 to collect
medicines use data from health facilities
and to recommend interventions for
improving the use of medicines.26 In 2012,
antimicrobials stocked and used in different
types of health facilities were clearly deli-
neated, and national targets for the clinical
use of antimicrobials were set.27 The
National Action Plan to Contain
Antimicrobial Resistance (2016­2020) was
published in 2016.28
Despite the implementation of numerous
policies, nationwide use of surveillance net-
works and a national oversight committee, the
inappropriate use of medicines continues in
China. According to the National Surveillance
Report of Adverse Drug Reactions in 2015,
allopathic (Western) medicines accounted for
81.2% of the total adverse drug reaction
reports, among which 44.9% were anti-infec-
tives and 61.3% were antimicrobial infu-
sions.29 These reports indicate that a serious
problem persists. In 2012, the proportion of
total pharmaceutical expenditure remained
unacceptably high at 40% of THE,10 and
the average proportion of costs for outpatient
and inpatient medicines remained at respect-
ively 50% and 40% of average hospital
expenditures per patient.30 It is clear that
more must be done to ameliorate this
situation.
The main reason for the lack of success in
this regard is that intervention strategies
have remained limited to executive orders
and one-time inspections, within the scope
of clinical educational interventions. The
pharmaceutical sector is complex and
involves many stakeholders and divergent
interests. Policy interventions to improve
medicines use by any one actor will impact
the behavior of the rest. Because of the
special nature of this sector, case-by-case
solutions that only target an individual
problem often fail to achieve the expected
results because the goals of individual
policies may be inconsistent with or even
diametrically opposed to other policies.
Moreover, the interests of different entities
often interfere with those of other bodies.
An example is the national health system's
incentive structure, which adversely influ-
ences health professionals and intensifies the
problem. Adding to these obstacles are the
lack of suitable, integrated strategies, lack of
interaction between clinical and social sci-
ence professionals and lack of acknowledg-
ment of prescriber and patient behaviors.
Until all these obstacles are overcome, the
inappropriate use of medicines can never
be effectively and sustainably controlled.
A wider, systemic approach is needed to
achieve long-term, equitable and sustainable
results. Further research that explores the
relationship between appropriate incentives
(including financial and non-financial
approaches) and the behaviors of providers
and patients are needed to effect lasting
change.
Challenges to reducing
antimicrobial resistance
According to one study of global antibiotic
consumption,31 worldwide use between 2000
and 2010 rose a staggering 36%, from
54,083,964,813 to 73,620,748,816 standard
units. BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South Africa), with 41%
of the world's population in 2010,32 are
responsible for more than three-quarters of
that surge. China was the second largest
consumer of antibiotics in the world in
2010, accounting for 57% of the increase
in the hospital sector of BRICS countries.
One reason for this is the rapid economic
growth that has enabled China to achieve
universal health coverage in 2012.33 While
this situation has secured much greater
access to medicines (including antibiotics),
it has also meant that many broad-spectrum
antibiotics have been sold over-the-counter
without a documented clinical need. Official
regulations addressing this have in fact
been issued; however, they have not been
Cui et al. 1773
rigorously implemented in some areas of the
country. Moreover, official guidelines for
the clinical use of antimicrobials in China
have only recently been developed, and
evidence-based use has not yet been widely
accepted by health professionals, who gen-
erally adopt the opinions of their senior
colleagues.34
Compared with hospital care in urban
areas, primary care in rural areas faces even
greater challenges because of the lack of
qualified health professionals and poor
access to information, as well as lower
economic development. Problems of irra-
tional use of antibiotics at primary care
facilities in rural areas may lead to an
increasing number of resistance problems
at higher levels of care. In addition, the
increase in travel and migration that has
accompanied China's rapid economic devel-
opment has also contributed to the growth
of the nation's AMR problem.
Most importantly, the Chinese health
system has been burdened by detrimental
financial incentives, which have intensified
the overuse of antimicrobial drugs. These
incentives include 1) inappropriate govern-
ment subsidies whereby limited resources are
focused on tertiary hospitals and infrastruc-
ture construction, and most other public
health facilities depend on the sale of medi-
cines to generate funding,35 and 2) distorted
pricing policies whereby the government sets
the prices for medical services far below the
real cost whereas prices for large-scale med-
ical equipment, diagnostic tests, medical
supplies and brand name medicines are set
much higher than the actual cost, which
induces health providers to overprescribe
expensive medicines and diagnostic tests
rather than provide quality care that is cost-
effective.36 Other major problems include the
conflict between insufficient public resources
and the resource-exhausted fee-for-service
provider payment mechanism,37 unsound
medicine procurement mechanisms with no
appropriate incentives for facilities to
procure low-priced medicines, and ``reverse-
proof'' responsibility for medical disputes
that encourages a defensive, prescription-
oriented attitude among physicians.38
A fourfold path to future reduc-
tion of AMR in China
Strengthening surveillance at all levels
National level. In response to World Health
Assembly resolutions urging member states
to formulate measures to promote the
proper and cost-effective use of antibiotics,39
China's NHFPC--formerly known as the
Ministry of Health (MoH)--committed
to increasing its scrutiny of antimicrobial
use and resistance. Two national surveil-
lance networks were established in 2005 by
the MoH for the above purpose. Initially,
35 tertiary hospitals joined the networks,
and this had expanded to 1,427 hospitals
(including both tertiary and secondary hos-
pitals) by the end of 2014. These networks
regularly collect, consolidate, summarize
and analyze data on clinical antimicrobial
use and resistance. They have also estab-
lished national databases for routine sur-
veillance and evaluation, provided feedback
to member hospitals and have periodically
reported to the MoH. The networks also
developed a set of standardized indicators
and methods for data collection as well as an
electronic data reporting system that enables
hospitals to report online. These networks
also disseminate standardized data collec-
tion and reporting methods at the local level
and act as a clearinghouse to share infor-
mation across all levels of surveillance and
evaluation.
Regional level. Until the end of 2014, each
province had its own surveillance network.
Some regions had also set up intercity
networks, which greatly strengthened sur-
veillance and evaluation and informed
policy at the local level.
1774 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
Hospital level. According to the national
campaign,23 all tertiary and secondary hos-
pitals are required to monitor and evaluate
antimicrobial clinical use and resistance at
their facility. The NHFPC also created a set
of national targets for all participating hos-
pitals, intended to decrease the number
of prescriptions that included antibiotics to
< 20% and < 60% for outpatients and
inpatients, respectively. Prophylactic anti-
biotics are to be given before surgical inci-
sion (except cesarean), and the general
duration of prophylaxis is to be < 24 hours
(except under specific conditions). Hospitals
are required to maintain total inpatient
consumption of antibiotics for systemic use
(ATC code J01) at < 400 DDD/1,000 inpa-
tient days. At each of the hospitals involved,
training is provided to help staff clearly
understand the new program's requirements
and goals, as well as to learn strategies for
achieving the targets.
Elimination of inappropriate financial
incentives
Ongoing health system reforms in China
have created an opportunity to address the
issue of incentives within the healthcare
system. The problem stems from an illogical
financing model in which hospital revenue
is generated by mark-up of medicines.
As top decision makers work to improve
the system, this model is giving way to a
financing model in which revenue is instead
generated by providing quality services
through allowing market competition.
The distorted pricing system of medical
services and medicinal products has been
changing towards a value-based pricing and
price negotiation mechanism, to replace the
former cost plus price setting methods.
Health insurance programs are required
to develop innovative strategies to create
incentives for the appropriate use of medi-
cines. These measures include expanding
coverage for both inpatient and outpatient
services; increasing diagnostic, treatment and
dispensing fees to make up for lost revenues
from medicines sales; changing payment
methods from retrospective fee-for-service
to prospective capitation-based and case-
based mixed payments; and supporting
polices to secure the quality of care, including
the appropriate use of medicines.
Prescription behavior changes
Prescription behavior is determined by a
variety of internal, external, social, eco-
nomic and cultural factors. The effectiveness
of interventions to improve prescribing
behavior depends to a large degree on the
content, delivery mechanism, intensity, con-
text and implementation environment.
Medicine interventions can be categorized
by type of measure, including clinical, edu-
cational, managerial, financial and regula-
tory.40,41 Effective interventions are always
broad-based, multidimensional programs
that are adapted to the particular situation
and address local barriers to change. No
single intervention can modify all behaviors
in any given setting.42­45 Thus, simply
restricting the use of antibiotics does not
lead to a desirable, scientifically sound and
cost-effective outcome. One reason is that
medical professionals have a seemingly deep-
rooted dislike of inexpensive, basic anti-
biotics such as penicillins and other narrow
spectrum antibiotics.20 Therefore, clinical
educational interventions, even those linked
to managerial measures, have failed to coun-
teract these negative perceptions. Rather
than simply restricting use, more sophisti-
cated and comprehensive policies are needed,
especially when hospital financing is heavily
dependent on the sale of medicines and
prescribers themselves can earn additional
income from dispensing or selling medicines.
The ways in which healthcare is financed
and how healthcare providers are paid
Cui et al. 1775
greatly affect treatment decisions because
financing mechanisms create different incen-
tives for providers.46 In many resource-
poor low- and middle-income countries,
for instance, health systems are not appro-
priately funded and regulated.47
Consequently, economic factors can be
important barriers to guideline compliance.48
New and more sophisticated financing mech-
anisms are needed, with units of payment
becoming broader and prices for bundled
services set on a prospective basis.49,50
Coordination of stakeholders and infor-
mation sharing
Coordination and information sharing could
provide an up-to-date overview of the present
situation of AMR. Increased collaboration
between networks will make it increasingly
important to share experiences and form a
basis of coordinated collaboration to change
behaviors. In addition, surveillance systems
must be flexible and able to adapt to emer-
ging microbial resistance and not focus on
what is already known. Surveillance systems
should also be able to promptly deliver
information to avoid delays in public health
actions at both local and national levels.
Conclusion
The use of antibiotics and antimicrobial
resistance is a great challenge for China.
Fortunately, ongoing health system reforms
have created opportunities to address this
challenge using more comprehensive and
integrated strategies so as to fundamentally
change the incentives for use of antibiotics
and to contain resistance.
