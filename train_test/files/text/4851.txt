Introduction
Business and management research seems reluctant to con-
sider or even acknowledge the managerial imagination as a
viable concept of study and application. Instead, manage-
ment researchers have left imagination as largely the pre-
serve of other disciplines, such as literature (Hughes, 1988),
philosophy (Gaut, 2003; Sallis, 2000; Satre, 1972; Warnock,
1994), psychology (Murray, 1987), educational studies
(Egan, 1992; Egan & Nadaner, 1988; Robinson, 2001, 2009),
music (Harvey, 1999), and sociology (Mills, 1973). Mills
(1973) described the sociological imagination as an intellec-
tual craft for scholarship conferring the ability to shift per-
spectives and obtain a totality of view by connecting history,
biography, and social structure. He suggested that imagina-
tion is the "most fruitful" and cultivatable form of self-con-
sciousness in which "men, whose mentalities have swept
only a series of limited orbits often come to feel as if sud-
denly awakened in a house with which they had only sup-
posed themselves familiar" (Mills, 1973, p. 8).
Osborn (1953) was one of the earliest management writ-
ers to explicitly recognize the importance of imagination in
business. More recent forays into the field are those of Schon
(1983), Spender (2007), and Martin (2010). Spender built on
Schon by suggesting that the role of the imagination found in
art could be applied to management, a subject area domi-
nated by rationalist philosophy and the application of scien-
tific method.
In this article, the author follows Spender's suggestion by
building on Mills's idea that social science deals with prob-
lems of biography, history, and their intersection with social
structures. A fourth dimension also has been added, namely,
"personal problem farming" (Schon, 1983) to capture the
way individuals perceive problems and make sense of them
essentially in a subjective manner. The article then goes on to
suggest that through the use of the managerial imagination, a
manager can develop into what is termed "the imaginative
performer" and apply this to the area of human resource
management (HRM). The human resource (HR) manager

Managerial Imagination: HRM and "The
Imaginative Performer"
Michael Savvas1
Abstract
This article analyzes the links between imagination and human resource management. The concept imagination has received
little scholarly attention within the field of management, despite its potential to inform a number of lines of inquiry. At the
present time, much of the research literature on imagination is confined to the visual arts, literature, and education. Human
resource (HR) professionals could play a part in aligning employees with organizational goals and bring about organizational
change if they developed their thinking in a more imaginative way. Developing managerial imagination can help solve the
dilemmas and contradictions they face. A diagram is developed, which maps the development of the personnel function and
offers four possibilities within a framework. They are biography, personal framing, history, and social structure. The outcome
of this analysis provides a development of the personnel function one of which is a globally imaginative HR management.
Within such a framework, the concept of "the imaginative performer" is discussed. The implications of combining imagination
with management may provide a theoretical and practical way to understanding HR management.

can use imagination to solve two particular dilemmas,
namely, a balancing act between a positive contribution to
organizational success and acting as a guardian of fairness in
the treatment of employees, and coping with the tension per-
sonnel professionals can experience between being manage-
rialist and being professional (Pilbeam & Corbridge, 2002).
The article is structured in the following way. The concept
of imagination is discussed in "The Development of the
Meaning of Imagination" section of this article. The litera-
ture covering the managerial imagination is discussed in
"The Managerial Imagination" section, whereas "The
Managerial Imagination and Its Application to Human
Resource Management" section discusses the concept of the
imaginative performer. A summary and conclusion follows
in "Summary and Conclusion" section.
The Development of the Meaning of
Imagination
Various definitions and descriptions of imagination are sum-
marized in Table 1. From this, one can see why (Gaut, 2003)
called it a slippery concept.
One of the problems identifiable in Table 1 is the variety
of meanings of imagination inherent in the complex and mul-
tifaceted nature of the concept, and the fact that imagination
lies at the crux of those aspects of our lives that are less well
understood (Egan, 1992). In describing the imagination,
scholars "refer to the capacity we have in common to hold
images in our minds of what may not be present or even
exist, and sometimes to allow these images to affect us as
though they were present and real" (Egan, 1992, p. 3). By
nature, an internal and personal and subjective, and hence
hard to describe, they are unlike other kinds of images we are
familiar with in the "external world." People also differ in
the quality of the experience associated with such images
some having a clear access to vivid quasi-pictorial images
(e.g., Kekulé in discovering the ring structure of the benzene
molecule in a reverie involving snakes swallowing their own
tails), and other people only having such vague experiences
as the word "image" seems almost inappropriate. However,
in this study, the author is more inclined to perceive the
imagination as having the inclination and ability to con-
sciously conceive of the unusual and effective in particular
ways (Barrow, 1988).
For example, through storytelling (Gabriel, 1997), we
conceive of and interpret the unusual and effective in a par-
ticular way and thus trigger the imagination and insight. By
applying the imagination, one can link one thought or object
with another and create a reason for the price or create value
for a product or service. In this case, a general story that pro-
vides an example of imagination in use can illustrate the
power of imagination and insight in developing a creative
solution to a problem. It involves a car journey in which a fan-
belt broke in a rather isolated country area on a Sunday after-
noon. The occupants had to return home reasonably quickly.
There were no garages in the vicinity. One solution was to
call the Automobile Association (AA) breakdown service.
However, no one in the car was a member. An alternative
solution was put forward by one member of the group. He
asked his wife to remove her tights so that they could be used
as a temporary fan belt. The tights were then applied and the
excessive ends of the tights that might interfere with the
engine were burnt off with a lighter. With the tights suffi-
ciently installed, the car was able to run and the car limped
home. This example could arguably be perceived as someone
in the group using imagination by relating one thought or
object with another, using the tights as a fan belt and creating
a value for the product of service.
An example from business management is the way Mike
Lazaridis founder of Research in Motion (RIM) imagined
what an executive's life would be like if you receive your
emails on a handheld device. How compelling would a phone
be if you can have a BlackBerry attached to your belt? He
could not "prove" that this would be a good idea. There were
no data on the demand patterns for smartphones, because
smartphones existed in his imagination. However, only 11
years after the launch of the product of his imagination, RIM
led Motorola by an even greater margin in sales-market
shares and profitability (Martin, 2010).
The Managerial Imagination
This article suggests that imagination involves imaginings of
various types involving, but not equivalent to, the forming of
images and the capacity to think in novel and unusual ways.
It is not being argued here that imaginings should replace
other forms of cognition such as deliberative and reasoned
rational analysis. However, imaginative management would
involve the disciplined and crafted use of the imagination as
opposed to the idle and naïve play of fancy. Managerial
imaginings would acknowledge and accommodate the vital
significance of history and biography as in Mills's (1973)
sociological imagination. This use of history and biography
and their intersection within social structure and the added
concept of personal problem framing would help to uncover
the turning points in individuals' lives that these create and
reflect, and recognize the profound influences that these
exert on past, current, and future ways of perceiving and
knowing.
Martin (2009) has perceived of imagination as a tool of
the design thinker. In Martin's view, the tools of the crafts-
man are efficiency vehicles. "Without a conceptual tool kit,
you would have to tackle every problem from first princi-
ples" (Martin, 2009, p. 154). Theories and processes make it
possible to categorize problems, and apply tools to them that
have proved effective in similar circumstances in the past
(Martin, 2009).
The managerial imagination, therefore, consists of the use
of the imagination as a tool to combine ideas that no one
expected were combinable. As Mills (1973) suggested,
Savvas 3
"Imagination is often successfully invited by putting together
hitherto isolated items, by finding unsuspected connexions"
(p. 221). Such a capacity cannot come from just mere tech-
nique or expertise. A manager can be "well trained" but
given that one can be educated or trained only in what is
already known (what Revans, 1983, referred to as "pro-
grammed knowledge"), training may incapacitate one from
being able to learn new ways of seeing. These new ways may
sometimes be loose and unclear, but it is necessary to cling to
such vague images and notions, for it is in such forms that
original ideas may first appear.
To stimulate the managerial imagination, a number of
practices can be adopted and adapted from Mills' work with
regard to "intellectual craftsmanship." For the manager part
of such a craft is learning to use one's life experiences in
one's work on the assumption that by continually examining,
reflecting, and interpreting one's own reactions in certain
situations, they might better understand how they might react
in similar situations.
Afurther element of an intellectual craftsmanship inspired
by Mills is the adoption of an attitude of playfulness toward
phrases and words with which various issues are defined.
Original thinkers in other disciplines have also highlighted
the importance of playfulness as being the key to scientific
originality (Ramachandran, 2011). Both believe this loosens
the imagination, and for Mills, this may involve looking up
synonyms for key terms in dictionaries, to know the full
range of their connotations. Playfulness toward words could
implicate the deliberate use of metaphor to stimulate the
imagination or articulate intuitions (Vaughan, 1979). Such an
approach has proved fruitful in developing understanding
and conceptions of the complexities of organizational prob-
lems by encouraging individuals to think and act in new
ways by extending horizons of insight and creating new pos-
sibilities (Morgan, 1997). Gaut and Livingston (2003) argued
that metaphor-making is a paradigm of the creative use of the
imagination, because it mirrors some of the functioning of
imagination and so supports a metacognitive understanding
Table 1. Various Definitions and Descriptions of Imagination.
Various definitions of imagination
Barrow (1988) To be imaginative is to have the inclination and ability to consciously conceive of the unusual and effective in
particular ways. (p. 84)
Blackburn (2006) Imagination most directly, the faculty of reviving or especially creating images in the mind's eye. But more
generally the ability to create and rehearse possible situations, to combine knowledge in unusual ways. (p. 180)
Egan (1992) When people try to describe the imagination, most frequently they refer to the capacity we have in common
to hold images in our minds of what may not be present or even exist, and sometimes to allow these
images to affect us as though they were present and real. (p. 3)
Egan (1992) Imagination entails the ability to transcend the obstacles to thinking with which easy acceptance of
conventional beliefs, ideas, interpretations, representations, and so on, confront us. (p. 47)
Hughes (1988) The imagination usually denotes not much more than the faculty of creating a picture of something in our
heads and holding it there while we think about it. Since this is the basis of nearly everything we do, clearly
it's very important that our imagination should be strong rather than weak. (p. 35)
Mills (1973) Imagination is the capacity to range from the most impersonal and remote transformations to the most
intimate features of the human self and to see the relations between them. (p. 12)
Mock (1970) Imaginative understanding gives an extra dimension to our rational thinking and understanding, making us
capable of responding to imaginative truth which is embodied in the arts and cannot be expressed by any
other means. (p. 32)
Robinson (2009) Imagination is the power to bring to mind things that are not present in our senses. (p. 58)
Warnock (1994) Coleridge divides the imagination itself into primary and the secondary. Primary imagination is that which we
deploy in all perception, by which in some inexplicable manner we create the real world, with which we
are familiar. Secondary imagination is, Coleridge says, "an echo" of primary. It, unlike the primary, "coexists
with the conscious will." It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate. It is the imagination at work
in great works of art. (p. 41)
White (1990) To imagine something is to think of it as possibly being so. (p. 184)

of imagination, that is, metaphor-making is an instance of
deliberative creative imagining.
Another aspect of Mill's intellectual craftsmanship is the
skill of making up ideal types, as opposed to stereotypes.
Ideal types are abstractions that may be used to better under-
stand reality. Weber (1949) gave us the example of the ideal
type of bureaucracy, but they could be charts, tables, dia-
grams, and so on. For Weber, ideal types were mental con-
structs that are ideal in the "logical sense," that is, they state
a logical extreme, they "distort" and abstract from reality,
they can be used to formulate an abstract model of the gen-
eral form and interrelated causes and effects of a complex
phenomenon (Jary & Jary, 1991).
Finally, part of such craftsmanship may involve thinking in
terms of extremes or taking polar opposites to what one is
directly concerned with to achieve alternative insights. Taking
extreme positions may help individuals to think from a variety of
viewpoints, which enables the mind to become a moving prism,
catching light from as many angles as possible, hence "release of
the imagination can sometimes be achieved by deliberately
inverting your sense of proportions" (Mills, 1973, p. 236).
Method
This article sets out a theoretical framework to encourage a
debate about the managerial imagination and its implications
for HRM. The article comes from reflections on my reading
(Martin, 2010; Schon, 1983; Spender, 2007; Vance, Groves,
Paik, & Kindler, 2007) and experience as a researcher and
teacher on this subject: It includes examples in which the author
has been involved in a formal setting and informal experience.
The author's interest has also been stimulated by finding
that the physical sciences imagination is also required. In his
biography of Einstein, Isaacson (2012) acknowledged the
importance of imagination in his work: "Einstein had elusive
qualities of genius, which included an intuition and imagina-
tion that allowed him to think differently" (p. 40).
This then is an introduction to ideas for a new way of
thinking about HRM. It cannot be perceived as fully devel-
oped at this stage. The outline of imagination as one concep-
tion of nonlinear thinking has a considerable history in many
disciplines such as fine art and literature. It now requires
development both analytically and creatively in HRM and
management generally. Once greater clarity is achieved
between imagination and HRM, further research and empiri-
cal work are possible. The next section will therefore explore
the links between managerial imagination and HRM.
The Managerial Imagination and
Its Application to Human Resource
Management
Stone (2007) and Deadrick and Stone (2009) took stock of
the status of theory and research in HRM, questioning "where
have we been and where should we go from here?"
From time to time we believe that researchers need to pause and
reflect on the status of theory and research in human resource
management. The reason is that this is the only way we can
continue to make important contributions to theory, research and
practice. (p. 51)
Dipboye (2007) responded to some of these issues and
argues that HRM falls short in three areas: first, cumulative
progress in theory development; second, rigorous methodol-
ogy; third, relevance to important stakeholders. Scholars of
HRM need to reflect on these comments. Academic progress
in particular is an issue of concern for advancing HRM.
Dipboye offers two further useful insights: First, HRM
researchers should be monogamous in their questions but
promiscuous in their methods; second, they should simulta-
neously embrace the simplicity of science and the complex-
ity and confusion of practice. Our response to these critiques
is as follows: A reconceptualization of HRM as a craft
through the engagement with and embracing of the manage-
rial imagination can address some perceived shortcomings
and support and facilitate the practices of imaginative
performance.
More recently, some senior HR professionals have
referred to "insight" as an important ingredient for future HR
leaders (Orme, 2010), arguing that the next generation of HR
leaders should have such an insight that she defines as the
leader having business "savvy," practical understanding of
their organization, understanding the context of markets, and
the influence of technological changes. Orme argued for dif-
ferent types of insight, for example, insights into the strategic
health of the organization, its organizational ability and
adaptability in facing challenges in the future, insights into
people and culture, and insights into transactional enablers.
The development of such insight draws fundamentally,
essentially, and necessarily on use of the managerial imagi-
nation by HR leaders. If Orme is arguing for practical
"insights" for future HR leaders, Martin (2009) is arguing for
design thinking for leaders in which imagination is part of a
personal knowledge system, and is a further development
with regard to management.
In support of the argument, imagination is applied to
HRM and personnel management. The framework depicted
in Figure 1 is derived from but is not exclusively linked to
Mills (1973). It documents a transition from personnel man-
agement into imaginative HR. In the pursuit of a pragmatic
and even normative outcome, the concept of the Imaginative
Performer is introduced. In providing a framework that links
the imagination with HRM a challenge is posed to the func-
tionalism (Watson, 2009), which has tended to dominate
HRM. In drawing on Mills, this article offers an alternative
conceptualization with implications for both theory and
practice and builds on Watson's (2009) critical and prag-
matic account of the realities of HRM.
The dimensions of the framework are biography and
social structure, and history and personal problem framing.
The development of the personnel function can be traced
Savvas 5
within the model, and different conceptions of HR as they
have evolved over time may be categorized in the frame-
work: retrospectively (a) traditional personnel management,
(b) HRM, (c) international HRM, and prospectively toward
(d) globally imaginative HR. The four elements of the frame-
work are discussed below.
Originally, biography, or life story, referred to the account
given by an individual about his or her life. This personal
account (sometimes backed up by additional external
sources, such as official records, letters, diaries) constitutes a
life history of substantive events in chronological order and
is "the account given by an individual, only with the empha-
sis upon the ordering into themes or topics that the individual
chooses to adopt or omit as s/he tells the story" (Miller, 2007,
p. 19). Mills's (1973) position was that social science deals
with problems of biography, history, and their intersections
within social structures: Biography applies to HRM in that it
is associated with what Mills referred to as personal troubles,
in this case of particular employees. It has to do with his or
her self and those "limited" areas of social life of which they
are directly and personally aware. Such troubles are private
matters. They may represent the values and norms of specific
individuals who perceive that these values and norms are
threatened by the organization in which they work.
The historical dimension or history provides a methodical
record of past events. For historians, the goal has usually
been the understanding and explanation of specific historical
situations (Jary & Jary, 1991). More recently, Jordanova
(2006) argued that it is difficult to say what the defining
characteristics of history are, although eclecticism and ana-
lytical flexibility are major features: "Integrating apparently
diverse sources and approaches to produce more holistic
accounts is an important goal of the discipline" (p. 4). History
is important to HRM because without the use of history and
without a historical sense of psychological matters, the HR
specialist cannot adequately state the kinds of problems that
ought now to be the central point of their studies. They can-
not easily identify what are the critical issues that need to be
addressed in their own time and specific to their organiza-
tion. A historical dimension provides a way in which HR
managers can "read" the situation within the "lesson" of
history.
Both biography and history are dimensions that can be
linked to the managerial imagination. Mills (1973) echoed
Thomas and Znaniechi in that "social science deals with the
problems of biography, of history and of their intersection
with social structures--these three biography, history, and
society are the points of the proper study of man" (p. 159). It
is an approach that features both breadth and process, which
distinguishes biographical and history methods, which argu-
ably cannot be captured by predetermined quantitative meth-
ods of research. Therefore, attempts to capture the future is
arguably a dimension of history that relies on the use of the
imagination and not measurement. To imagine a future, one
has to look beyond the measurable variables, beyond what
can be proven with past data (Martin, 2010). This is what
Lazaridis was attempting at RIM in developing the
smartphone.
Personal Framing is concerned with how an individual
sees a problem in his or her own way depending on prior
events and predispositions (e.g., experiences and personal-
ity). Pragmatically, one has to decide what the problem is (or
frame it) before one can decide what to do about it, and dif-
ferent individuals may frame the same problem in different
ways, and may reframe the same problem differently in the
light of experience. Thus, they may transform it differen-
tially. Problem framing is concerned with how an individual
perceives, interprets, and makes sense of a personal problem,
and which may not be shared with others. The personal fram-
ing can also be perceived as constructed and reconstructed
within a sociohistorical network of associations. Networks
such as nuclear and extended families, job history, and per-
sonal life course can be compared and evaluated in relation
to the wider societal and historical events that have taken
place during one's lifetime (Miller, 2007). Personal framing
can be associated with the shift from a positivist to an inter-
pretivist perspective in social analysis (Calhoun, Gerteis,
Moody, Pfaff, Virk, 2007). Research in the interpretivist tra-
dition is more often linked by researchers studying organiza-
tions in the 21st century. It is also associated with cultures
such as the United Kingdom, which emphasizes the value of
individualism as opposed to collectivism (Hofstede &
Hofstede, 2005). This suggests that HRM needs to take
account of how an employee interprets his or her personal
understanding of organizational issues. Employees may
interpret their problems as a private matter. However, when
such a "problem" is interpreted by many employees, it may
become a public issue, which goes beyond the individual's
understanding. This then becomes an issue that could be
understood at a social structural level of analysis.
Social Structure is a complex concept on which there is
disagreement even among social scientists. Giddens defines
"structure as the `rules and resources' that act as common
interpretive schemes in a particular social system" (Calhoun

et al., 2007, p. 221). Structures are related to practices in
roughly the same way that language is related to speech.
Structures organize practices, but at the same time, structures
are enacted and reproduced by practices (Calhoun et al.,
2007). It should be further argued that although we can expe-
rience structures as something external to us, they cannot be
observed except through their effects on practices. Finally,
for Giddens (1976), the notion of structure is important
because it emphasizes that it is not just constraining, but it is
also enabling.
It could be argued that social structure is linked to HRM
because to use an analogy from Mills, it is linked to public
issues. Such public issues have to do with matters that tran-
scend the "local" context of the individual and the range of
his or her inner life. An issue becomes a public matter and is
not exclusive to one individual. Thus, we will further argue
that issues that transcend the "local" are more associated
with international and globally imaginative HRM.
Traditional personnel management lies at the intersection
of biography and history. Much of traditional personnel man-
agement deals with employees' well-being and needs and
reactively resolves problems linked to the individual welfare
of employees. Personnel professionals dealt with the per-
sonal troubles of individual employees in a reactive way if
this affected individual and organizational performance. The
biography and history of employees thus become important
to understand what Pilbeam and Corbridge (2002) called
sensitive employment issues such as stress in the workplace
and how this affects absentee rates.
HRM lies at the intersection of biography and personal
framing. For example, HRM came to prominence during the
1980s when greater emphasis was given to an individualistic
rather than collectivistic approach to employee relations.
Arguably, this shift from a collectivistic to a more individu-
alistic approach to the relationship between an employer and
employee requires the HR manager to understand not only
the biography of employees but also their personal frame of
reference. It could be argued that employees, given their
increasing individualistic approach to the workplace, framed
and reframed their situation in the changing context of
employability and hence careers since the 1980s. Writers
such as Kanter (1989) suggested that managers can no longer
rely on the organization for their career development and
must learn to manage themselves and their work indepen-
dently. Early HRM models offered the possibility that the
personnel function could not only meet the challenges cre-
ated by increasing competitive pressures and industrial
restructuring in many Western economies but also embody a
strategic role if it utilized its philosophies and practices
(Guest, 1987). Employees are valued assets and a major
source of competitive advantage, and managers need to
engender commitment and loyalty to ensure high levels of
performance. Through knowing each employee's biography
and personal problem frame, the HR manager would be bet-
ter placed to perceive the turning points in the lives of such
employees with the possible implications for the organiza-
tion. These turning points could be crucial in understanding
individual employees' ambitions, strengths, skills, and
knowledge, and how best they can contribute to their
organization.
International HRM lies at the intersection of history and
social structure. One variable that differentiates international
from "domestic" HRM is complexity (Dowling, Festing, &
Engle, 2008). This complexity is due to firms operating in
different countries with and across different cultures and
employing different categories of workers (Dowling et al.,
2008). Such complexity can be attributed to a number of fac-
tors including the need for a broader perspective. Thus, such
complexity requires greater versatility in using both linear
and nonlinear approaches in today's not only complex but
also uncertain and unpredictable global business environ-
ment. Such a business environment requires managers and
HR professionals to reach beyond linear thinking involving
rationality, analysis, logic, reason, and prediction based on
cause and effect (Siggelkow & Rivkin, 2005). To comple-
ment such thinking, recent writers have advocated the impor-
tance of nonlinear thinking (Vance et al., 2007), which
includes imagination.
As Warnock (1994) suggested, if we can educate a per-
son's imagination, we will give him or her a place in time.
We will allow them to stretch the sense of the present back
into the past, both their own individual past, and that of the
world as a whole. One could argue that the education of man-
agers and HR professionals has tended to be ahistorical and
not always emphasizing nonlinear thinking styles such as the
imagination.
A globally imaginative HRM lies at the intersection of
personal framing and social structure. The reason why per-
sonal framing may be perceived as important is that an HR/
personnel manager needs to define and redefine his or her
definition of the situation. It is argued that such a manager
needs to use his or her personal framing in a complex world.
For the globally imaginative HR manager, the capacity is to
also think in a particular way, thinking of the possible.
Engaging the imagination is nurturing this capacity in one's
self or in others. Some have argued that "management may
be more about the exercise of the managerial imagination
rather than a rigorous body of academic knowledge"
(Spender, 2007, p. 38). Imagination presents a means to pose
challenges to the taken-for-granted assumptions offering the
potential to enable practitioners to stand outside their taken-
for-granted practice. If as Spencer argues, conceptualizing
imaginative management as a process involving serious hard
work and commitment that pushes the limits of practice, then
one could argue that such an approach is what Mills referred
to as "craftsmanship." If the personal framing dimension of
the model requires a more imaginative and reflective practi-
tioner, then the limits of his or her constraints would emerge
at a structural level of analysis. This dimension will now be
discussed.
Savvas 7
A central issue at a social structural level is the continued
impact of globalization, which reflects international eco-
nomic integration arising from the revolution in communica-
tion technologies, the growth and dominance of international
capital markets, labor migration, and the global reach and
influence of multinational corporations (Bach, 2005).
Accordingly, the volatility of employment due to globaliza-
tion has promoted more contingent work, which has meant a
shift in the management of the employment relationship
away from a single employer, who has influence over HR
practices and seeks employee commitment. It could be
argued that there is a diversity of the employment relation-
ship that exists in multiemployer, networked organizations.
This can be seen in the ways staff are employed and whether
they are full-time, part-time, or temporary workers. If the
social structural part of the model in this segment is about
globalization and its influence on the nature of work, the per-
sonal problem framing is about the individual employee and
how he or she interprets and gives meaning to the nature of
work. If globalization provides the framework at a structural
level, the individual employees' frame of reference makes
sense by constructing and reconstructing the employment
relationship. However, this reconstruction takes place within
a framework created at a structural level. Thus, the commit-
ment-based approach at the heart of the early HRM models
has given way to an emphasis on ensuring that employees are
engaged and gain emotional meaning from work. In such a
scenario, a pragmatic approach toward HR entails engage-
ment with the managerial imagination to cope with complex-
ities and ambiguities of contemporary workplaces, and to
imagine useful tools rather than pursue universal generalized
and "correct" solutions (Watson, 2009).
The next section of this article discusses the concept
imaginative performer using a specific example from HRM,
namely, recruitment and selection.
The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development
(CIPD Professional Standards, 2009) has referred to the
model of the "Thinking Performer" as someone who (a) con-
sciously seeks to contribute to underlying organizational
purposes, (b) when necessary reinforces compliance of the
HR role but realizes that doing so is not sufficient of itself to
add value, (c) challenges the way things are done, and finds
alternative solutions, and (d) keeps in touch with "custom-
ers" and reacts to feedback and proactively develops as an
individual.
One could argue that finding alternative solutions to an
HR problem requires linear and nonlinear thinking. The form
of nonlinear thinking emphasized in this article is
imagination.
Therefore, this article is putting forward the concept of
the imaginative HR performer by offering an example related
to one aspect of the role, namely, that of recruitment and
selection. This will be conducted at a number of levels of
analysis. At the individual level, the author's experience of
teaching HRM practitioners observed that some were highly
structured, bureaucratic and conventional in their thinking
and practice. They wanted highly structured situations and
perceived as deviant or unimportant knowledge and practice,
which did not contribute to a particular norm or frame of
reference familiar to them. They appeared to be deductive/
inductive thinkers. However, more recent business research
has focused on the importance of abductive thinking (Martin,
2009). In abductive thinking, the goal is to posit what could
possibly be true. It is usually associated with more nonlinear
forms of thinking such as imagination and intuition. This is
not to suggest that all personnel practitioners should be
abductive thinkers but that they should find a balance
between deductive/inductive and abductive thinking. It is
argued here that the imaginative performer should develop a
balance in their thinking.
As part of the role of the personnel practitioner, Brown
and Hesketh (2004) highlighted the complexities of the
recruitment and selection process in their research on gradu-
ate employability. They found a range of techniques adopted
by assessment centers on behalf of companies wishing to
recruit staff. Apart from a range of techniques associated
with deductive/inductive thinking, they also partially refer to
constructive imagination and intuitive originality under a
chapter called a "science of gut feeling." Clearly, they found
in their research that assessors were considering not only
deductive/inductive but also abductive approaches. It could
be argued that the imaginative manager in his or her recruit-
ment and selection process needs to consider such a balance,
and that part of such a process will be the importance of
future scenarios; such scenario building requires imagination
as well as deducing the past performance of candidates.
At a further level of analysis, we return to the dilemmas
facing personnel professionals highlighted earlier in this arti-
cle, namely, the case of experiencing tension between being
managerialist and being professional (Pilbeam & Corbridge,
2002). An emphasis on competitive advantage and "added-
value" may be perceived as threatening some aspects of pro-
fessionalism, and the HR manager may take actions that are
in conflict with his or her professional and ethical standards.
The professional demands require members to continuously
update knowledge and expertise to ensure professional stan-
dards are maintained. Thus, ambiguities and tensions can be
reduced, but these first have to be recognized and clarified.
The personnel manager has to balance making a positive
contribution to organizational success and acting as a guard-
ian of fairness in the treatment of employees. One could
describe such a balance as the manager oscillating between
these two positions. It is therefore argued that this requires
both linear and nonlinear thinking. Thus, such a balance
requires nonlinear thinking such as imagination.
The imaginative performer, through scenario planning,
needs to also demonstrate leadership and ability to facilitate
organizational change. In the case of recruitment and selec-
tion, the personnel professional oscillates between these ten-
sions. For an international assignment, these tensions are
8 SAGE Open
potentially even greater. Some have argued that the key dif-
ference between international and domestic HRM is the
greater complexity of operating in different countries and
using different national categories (Dowling et al., 2008).
The lesson to be drawn about international recruitment and
selection is that such a tension between the skills and
competencies that organisations think they should be looking for
when they recruit and on the other hand the skills that are
actually needed to make a success of working abroad. (Sparrow,
1999, p. 173)
It is argued in this article that the imaginative performer
should not only be aware of such tensions but also reduce
them by creating a reason and a value for the service. This
requires one's own personal knowledge system part of which
is imagination (Martin, 2009). Such a personal knowledge
system in an international setting requires certain leadership
characteristics such as self-confidence, curiosity, communi-
cation skills, care goals and expectations, and also imagina-
tion (Schneider & Barsoux, 2003).
There are several possible future research directions relat-
ing to the concept of managerial imagination. One such
direction is concerned with the notion of a learning organiza-
tion. Senge (1990) referred to identifying five vital dimen-
sions in building organizations that learn. Two of these
dimensions are mental models and team learning. In the for-
mer, the managerial imagination can help HR managers
redefine the deeply ingrained assumptions they may have
about the organization and their role as HR professionals.
Rothwell, Prescott, and Taylor (2008) argued that HR profes-
sionals are being asked to transform their organizations bet-
ter, by playing an important role in aligning talent with
organizational goals, and in bringing about organizational
change. They further argued the transformation of the HR
function should begin by focusing on these future trends. The
discipline of working with mental models starts with learn-
ing to unearth our internal pictures or images of the organiza-
tion, to bring them to the surface and to scrutinize them. It
also includes the ability to reflect on various imaginative
options where people expose their own thinking effectively
and make that thinking open to the influence of others. This
can be achieved in team learning. This starts with dialogue,
with the capacity of members of a team to suspend assump-
tions and enter into a process of thinking together. This
allows the group to discover insights that may arise.
Another research direction is the training and develop-
ment of future HR leaders. Some have argued that in terms of
HR development, there is some element of personal imagina-
tion and creativity involved (Gibb, 2004). This researcher
argues that what makes the difference is not the possession of
scientific knowledge but the use of imagination and creativ-
ity. As has been argued earlier, imagining means the capacity
to think in a particular way, thinking of the possible. Enabling
the use of the imagination is helping to develop this learning
in oneself and in others (Gibb, 2004). One writer has pro-
vided a planning framework for imaginative learning and
development (Egan, 1992). Admittedly, this was structured
for the development of the imagination in secondary school
children. Nevertheless, Egan's comprehensive research into
the concept and specifically the planning framework can be
adapted for the development and training of HR leaders and
practitioners.
Summary and Conclusion
This article has outlined how the managerial imagination can
be linked to HRM and is developed with a model to help bet-
ter understand such a link. In this process, it was necessary to
also outline and explore the concept of imagination as one
form of nonlinear thinking. Imagination may be perceived as
important to HR practitioners because it can help clarify orga-
nizational problems, and as such, it can help individuals and
their organizations help design policies and practices that will
lead to better solutions. A further argument is that more imag-
inative ways of solving problems and adding greater competi-
tive advantage are neglected in the formal and informal
education, training, and development of HR managers.
One could conceive of HRM as a "bridging culture" in
resolving two dilemmas with the use of imagination. First,
the HR manager can use imagination to solve the balancing
act that is required between a positive contribution to organi-
zational success and acting as a guardian of fairness in the
treatment of employees. Second is the tension HR profes-
sionals can experience between being managerial and being
professional. It is being suggested that to bridge these two
dilemmas, it is worth returning to Mills (1973). Instead of the
sociological imagination, one can talk about a managerial
imagination. This can be conceived as an intellectual craft,
which enables the ability to shift from the concrete to an
abstract, from simplicity to complexity in understanding an
organizational problem. It enables the HR manager to shift
perspectives and obtain a totality of view connecting history,
biography, social structure, and personal framing.
The model provided in this article attempts to locate vari-
ous dimensions of the personnel function at various positions
in the model from traditional personnel to a globally more
imaginative HR. It is in the latter that arguably deeper think-
ing is required because of the greater complexity of the HR
function. In this situation, the HR professional needs to
develop approaches better suited to his or her organization,
its business goals, culture, and its competitive context. This
requires more imaginative thinking at macro and micro lev-
els when constructing HR policies and practices for cross-
cultural people management and development.
To develop a managerial imagination in HR professionals
both at a domestic and international level, the ideas under
discussion could be developed into a craft involving tools for
imagination to help support changes in HRM. The research
questions that might be asked may include the following:
Savvas 9
In what ways do you resolve an HR problem using a men-
tal or visual image?
In what kind of situation is your imaginative decision pro-
cess triggered?
How is it possible to debate about storytelling in a discus-
sion on imagination?
How is it possible to use metaphors to better understand
organizational problems?
How can we develop more unconventional, original, or
inventive ways at work? Can you visually describe such a
situation in the past and future?
In conclusion, it appears that compared with other forms
of nonlinear thinking such as creativity and intuition, imagi-
nation has had less consideration and acknowledgment in
business research. This article is an attempt to help further
develop imagination as a fruitful avenue for research. The
concept of managerial imagination and the imaginative per-
former can bring new insights to the HR professional and
offer a new set of solutions that would benefit both employ-
ees and the organization.
