Introduction
Previous research has shown that video monitoring (VM) is
effective in teaching behavior to students with autism spec-
trum disorder (ASD) because of their well-developed ability
to take in information visually through television (Banda,
Matuszny, & Turkan, 2007; Greatz, Mastropieri, & Scruggs,
2006). In a meta-analysis of VM and video self-monitoring
(VSM), Bellini and Akullian (2007) found that respondents
with ASD are able to copy positive behavior modeled on
television (by themselves or others) if they recognize them-
selves in the film; however, they must already have the abil-
ity to act in the desired way and to understand the modeled
behavior as desirable. Most early studies used videos to dem-
onstrate the desired behavior to students, who learned by
observing and copying. But what happens when the students
do not have insight into their own behavior?
A study by Greatz et al. (2006) showed that students who
are unaware of their unwanted behaviors have difficulty elim-
inating it and displaying only the desired behavior. Dratsch
et al. (2013) found that people with autism are impaired in
detecting direct gaze, and therefore also have a deficit in per-
ceiving social cues. This deficit makes it more difficult for
them to develop social skills than it is for people with no such
deficit. The aim of this study was to examine how an inter-
vention that focused the respondents on certain cues might
help them to develop their social skills. Shulman, Guberman,
Shiling, and Bauminger (2012) found that when discussing
social and moral issues, people with ASD showed less flexi-
bility than other people, less abstract thought, and less ability
to adapt their judgment to different contexts and situations.
They used pictures of undesired behaviors in their study, and
compared 18 respondents withASD with 18 respondents with
typical development. The authors discussed the specific
implications of these findings for education in the field of
social and moral education, but they may have placed too
much importance on abstract thinking, flexibility, and gener-
alization to new contexts when trying to understand the
respondents' reasoning. There is a risk that individuals with
ASD use other ways of dealing with social interactions that
we do not yet have tools to capture. Even if there has been
found positive results regarding social review, the studies are
not explicitly based on a theory of learning. Instead, research
on autism has increasingly focused on the development of
social skills, and various methods have been tested. Variation
theory has previously been used to demonstrate that social
skills can be developed in structured situations that allow

Social Review as a Tool for Developing
Social Skills: Using Contrasting Cases
Mona Holmqvist Olander1,2 and Helen Burman3
Abstract
The aim of this study is to, based on a theory of learning, compare in what ways two different cases of the use of self-
monitoring videotapes for developing social skills in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) facilitates social
behavior studied with a micro-level approach. Two verbal 15-year-old male students with ASD and cognitive disabilities were
filmed for 20 min in three different situations. Student A (Adam) was shown contrasting videotaped examples of his desired/
undesired behaviors and questioned about his perceptions. Based on variation theory, the conjecture to use contrasts to
enhance learning has been implemented. Student B (Bill) was videotaped in three different situations on three different
occasions, and his behavior was analyzed before and after the intervention by counting incidents of deviant behavior in all
nine videos. Both participants expressed increased awareness of their behavior and were able to sustain change, and Bill
decreased deviant behavior in one of the focused situations (practical instruction) from 37 to 3 incidents after 6 months.

respondents to discern specific differences between their own
behavior and the desired behavior, however not regarding
social review (Holmqvist, 1995, 2009). Ayres and Langone
(2005) said that "little progress has been made in identifying
the critical components of video models and video models
and video based instruction" (p. 195), and we have tried to
make progress by taking departure from a theory of learning.
In this study, the conjectures in variation theory have been
used to analyze what the respondents seem to discern from
the material in relation to their changed behavior. The theo-
retical framework is based on an assumption that learning
requires discernment, simultaneity, and variation intertwined
in every learning situation (Lo, 2012). The design offers the
respondents, one by one, to discern what behavior should be
modified. Previous studies on social review have mainly not
been based on a learning theory to design the instruction. In
this study, the theoretical point of departure was that the
respondents needed to be offered simultaneity in the learning
situation by showing two different situations (variation) from
the same respondent (invariant) and social activity (invari-
ant). By that the aspect that we want them to focus on is
varied against an invariant background; two different ways
to behave by the same person in the same situation. This is
called to design learning situation based on "patterns of vari-
ation" (Lo & Marton, 2012), which has been found very
powerful in different kinds of instruction (Marton & Tzu,
2004). Results have also pointed out the gain for teachers'
learning to design more powerful instructions by the use of
variation theory (Gustavsson, 2008; Holmqvist, 2011;
Holmqvist, Gustavsson, & Wernberg, 2008).
The social review method, using VSM, records the stu-
dent performing one targeted behavior on videotape and ana-
lyzes the film with the student, using a guide to structure the
learning (Quill, 1995). Several studies have used this method
in various ways aimed to make the student aware of his or
her behavior (McConell, 2002). This use of videotape differs
from that of VM, in which the desired behavior is modeled to
the student, often by another person. In social review, how-
ever, the person's own behavior is usually in focus. It is not
difficult in VM to show a person modeling the desired behav-
ior; however, VSM relies on the students'own performances.
If students do not evince the desired behavior in the video,
without seeing a clear example or contrast with unwanted
behavior they may believe they act appropriately. Bellini and
Akullian (2007) showed that VM and VSM intervention
strategies met the criteria for an evidence-based study design.
Their results showed that it was essential for students to see
the desired, rather than the undesired behavior, to raise their
awareness and motivation to acquire the model behavior. In
their 2007 study, Bellini and Akullian (Bellini & Akullian,
2007) edited out unwanted behaviors and used videos that
showed the students the desired behavior only, arguing that
the skill should be learned through positive examples. This
strategy was also used by Hitchcock, Dowrick, and Prater
(2003), who argued that seeing their own success would
strengthen the students' belief in their capacity to behave
appropriately. Hitchcock et al. described the two different
approaches:
Observing a superior level of performance that would indicate
future mastery of behavior is a key element. The video is
constructed by identifying and filming images of a desired
behavior and editing to create an "exemplary" sample of the
person performing the desired skill. This view is in contrast to
"feedback," which involves review of past or current
performance, including errors or deficits. Thus, feedback may
include a focus or discussion of errors in performance, which is
contrary to the philosophy of building new skills through a
positive, errorless approach. (p. 39)
However, some studies use examples of desired and unde-
sired behaviors to encourage change. Greatz et al. (2006)
studied a student who had no knowledge of his unwanted
behavior. He thought that he behaved appropriately, and thus
was not open to a learning situation until agreement was
attained between the student and the teacher about the desired
behavior. They videotaped his behavior, then edited the vid-
eos and showed the student separate films of the desired and
the undesired behaviors to clarify and make the student
aware of his current behavior. The authors of this study point
out the difficulty of making these students understand which
behaviors they need to change as they are more or less
unaware of their own behavior.
I knew that this differed from what most effective teaching
practices encourage; errorless performance that accentuates the
positive . . . there was a reason for him to actually see his
behavior spotlighted. (Greatz et al., 2006, p. 46)
In the two different videos, one about a minute long caught
the student in the desired behavior, and the other captured the
unwanted behavior. This method, of course, requires that
the student at some point present the desired behavior. In the
intervention, the film with the unwanted behavior was shown
first to clarify for the student and raise his awareness about
how he had behaved. The teacher commented throughout to
clarify what the student was doing and what effect his behav-
ior had. The student responded by sitting calmly and saying,
"Oh no!" After that, the film with the desired behavior was
shown. The teacher commented throughout this video as well.
In this case, the student responded by becoming jubilant and
saying, "That's me!" The student recognized himself and
showed awareness about the differences in his behavior
between the two films. He frequently watched the "good"
movie after that, and when he relapsed into the unwanted
behavior, a reminder of the "good" movie immediately
changed his behavior. This effect, however, requires the stu-
dent to have an interest in watching television and an under-
standing of what happens in the videos.
Banda et al. (2007) and Greatz et al. (2006) studied
whether people with ASD learn visually and whether they
Holmqvist Olander and Burman 3
like to watch TV, and found that they do on both counts.
According to Bellini and Akullian (2007), people with ASD
like to look at themselves, and this was especially obvious
in tapes that showed them succeeding. The results also show
that children with ASD find it easier to imitate actors who
resemble themselves in some way. Because it is not always
possible to capture on video examples of the students per-
forming the wanted behavior, the use of actors with whom
they can identify is an important alternative. Greatz et al.
argued that the use of videotape is useful in this group
because neither eye contact nor social interaction is required.
In addition, the use of videotape allows clear delineation of
desired (and undesired) behaviors and gives students the
opportunity to focus completely on themselves and their
behaviors. Banda et al. studied which skills were developed
in the target group through video observations and found
they were primarily the skills needed in everyday activities
(daily living), communication and social skills, which indi-
cated that the use of videotape was an effective method. But
academic skills and undesirable behaviors were also posi-
tively affected. A main difference between VM and VSM is
that any person can play the role in VM, whereas in VSM
the pupil in the learning situation enacts the behavior in the
films. McCoy and Hermansen (2007) compiled 34 case
studies of students with ASD using either VM or VSM. The
stimuli were divided into five groups according to the actor
of the role in the films: adults, other students (peers) similar
to the students in the learning situation, the students them-
selves performing the desired behavior, hands only visible
in a film illustrating the performance of a skill, and a mix-
ture of the four designs. The study showed that films with
the most significant influence were those in which the stu-
dents played the role (VSM), followed by those enacted by
their peers.
Although the methods of VM and VSM are time-con-
suming, results indicate the time is well spent. Banda et al.
(2007) argued that it is important for teachers to understand
that despite the initial time and expensive technology
involved in implementing a video method, VM was in fact
economical because the same peer-acted videos could be
used for many students with the same needs. Bellini and
Akullian (2007) found no clear evidence of difference
between the results for VM versus VSM, but that the ability
to generalize knowledge seemed to increase with VSM. This
was verified by Delano (2007), who compiled 19 case stud-
ies of VM and VSM, which showed even in early research
on influencing behavior and perspective-taking skills by
video analysis, VSM was more effective for developing
social skills. Bellini and Akullian conducted a meta-analysis
of 23 different case studies of VM and VSM with people
with ASD and found that both were effective strategies for
strengthening social and communication skills, living skills,
and behavior. This was true for children and adolescents
with ASD. The results showed that the methods enhanced
the ability to acquire skills that were maintained over time,
and that was generalized among students and situations.
This result was consistent with results from Hitchcock et al.
(2003), who analyzed 18 case studies using VSM with diag-
nosed and undiagnosed students.
The aim of this study is to, based on a theory of learning,
compare in what ways two different cases of the use of self-
monitoring videotapes for developing social skills in adoles-
cents with ASD facilitates their social behavior studied with
a micro-level approach. The design of the study is based on a
theory on learning: Variation theory and the theoretical con-
jectures have been used to design the instruction. The pattern
of contrast has been used to offer the respondents to discern
the undesired and desired behavior at the same time to model
the wanted behavior.
Method
Two 15-year-old male students who attended a special class
in school were chosen to be included in this case study. Both
had a diagnosis of autism, along with other cognitive dis-
abilities, and both were verbal and able to understand events
shown on a television screen. In the first case (A, Adam),
Carol Gray's (1995) method of social review was used, with
video recordings aimed at teaching students to "read" social
situations and thereby improve their social and communica-
tive interactions with the environment. Because the student
in this case believed he already exhibited the desired behav-
ior shown in the video, he was also shown a video demon-
strating the undesired behavior to show the difference
between them. In Case B, Bill, social review was combined
with VSM, as one aim of the study was to model the wanted
behavior. However, this method was further developed by
adding a contrast between wanted and unwanted behavior by
showing two different video clips of the respondent in both
kinds of behavior. In Case B, three different situations were
videotaped on three different occasions. The first showed a
structured manual learning situation (a domestic science les-
son) in a large group. This situation was filmed many times
to capture desired and undesired behaviors. The second situ-
ation that was filmed was a structured theoretical situation in
the classroom. This time the students were working in a
small group, as they normally did. During the lesson, about
four students sat around a table with one or two adults and
either worked with their weekly journals and summed up the
week's work with text and pictures or played games. The
third videotaped situation was during recess, when the
respondents had break outside together with other pupils and
were free to choose whatever they wanted to do. During the
structured situations, one camera on a tripod was placed in
the room and directed at the respondent. The unstructured
situation required other methods to videotape, because the
respondents were moving freely in the schoolyard. The
researcher held the camera and followed the respondents
during those situations. All films were 20 min long. The
films were then reviewed for appropriate clips of desired and
4 SAGE Open
undesired behavior, and a 2-min clip from the structured
practical situation (domestic science lesson) was produced,
as suggested also by Shukla-Mehta, Miller, and Callahan
(2010).
Results
The results of this study show thatAdam and Bill, in response
to social review with videos, were able to change their
behavior and to articulate what they were and were not per-
mitted to do. Analyses of the films showed that the respon-
dents became aware of the focus on their behavior in the
learning situation and were surprised when they saw their
unwanted behavior in the edited video. The contrast between
desired and undesired behavior was clear and helped the
respondents to be aware of the difference. At a 6-month fol-
low-up, they still referred to the film clips to modify their
behaviors in other situations as well as in the original learn-
ing environment.
Case A--Adam
As the videos were played, Adam was asked four questions:
(a) Who do you see in the movie? (b) What are the people
doing in the movie? (c) Are they talking to each other or are
they doing anything together? (Is there some kind of inter-
action or communication between the people in the movie?)
and (d) What do the people in the movie say? It is worth
noting that the student saw the movie many times and he
discovered new things each time. It took time for him to
perceive anyone other than himself. To answer Question 1,
Adam needed to see the video sequence only once. To
answer the remaining questions, he watched the movie
sequence 4 times for each question. In total, Adam saw the
sequence 13 times.
The first step was to identify a social situation needed to
be improved. A video sequence was selected that showed
Adam acting in his accustomed manner in a recognizable
situation in the kitchen where he worked. He was impulsive
and talked directly to the intercom receiver when he was
working in the kitchen. The student's deficiencies in proce-
dural memory made him lose focus easily, forget quickly
what he should do and how to do it, and lose control of his
movements when talking about anything other than what he
was doing at the moment. He was in need of continuous
direction from the teacher, which, along with the other fac-
tors, became irritating to the adults in the situation, who also
needed to correct and direct the student.
The second step was to watch the clip with no sound and
ask Adam, the four questions. The questions aimed to collect
information about how he perceived the situation with only
visual information (the aspect sound was removed). For
Question 1, "Who do you see in the movie?" Adam looked
all over the kitchen but could not name anyone until he saw
himself. Seeing himself seemed to orient him and he was
then also able to recognize the others. Question 2, "What are
people in the video doing?" was more difficult. He focused
on himself and what he was doing in the video, but did not
seem aware of what others were doing. During the second
showing of the video, Adam was asked direct questions
about what each person was doing, and with such strong ori-
entation toward the targeted persons, one at a time, he was
able to answer. However, he needed to watch 4 times to cap-
ture what everyone actually did; in comparison, what he
seems usually to be aware of in daily life is very limited. He
also had problems talking about anyone else than himself in
the video, and the third question, "Are they talking to each
other or are they doing anything together?" (Is there some
kind of interaction or communication between the people in
the movie?) was even more difficult than the second. In the
clip, Adam talked to the teacher twice, and this he knew
because he had turned toward the camera, which the teacher
was managing. Although he saw the clip 4 times he could not
see that there was no communication or interaction between
the others. Of course, the sound was turned off, but he was
unable to infer any interaction from actions, expressions, or
glances, as people usually do when looking through a win-
dow or inside a car.
The last question, intended to gather information about
how Adam perceived the situation with sound turned on,
was: "What are the people in the video saying?" He could
hear that he was talking all the time and that he talked about
many things. After having watched and listened 4 times
Adam identified that the teacher had asked him to do the
dishes. However, he never heard that a classmate had told
him several times that he would wash the dishes. He did not
notice that two of his classmates were talking to each other or
what they said. The analysis of the three initial steps showed
that Adam had many characteristics that were typical of
ASD. He was extremely self-centered and did not seem to
care about what other people said or did. He neither saw any
other person nor heard them if he was not very strongly
guided, and he had to watch the clips several times for each
question to say what had actually happened. The others'
interactions and communications seemed to be of no interest
to him. This may be explained by his lack of a theory of
mind, or it may be due to selective perception caused by the
student's brain being unable to integrate all the sensory input
adequately (Adler & Adler, 2006). Through his single focus
on himself, excluding all the other people and what they
were doing, he fit very well the picture of a person with ASD
(Frith, 2000).
The fourth step was to compare and share perspectives
about the situation in the film. When the teacher and Adam
discussed what was different between the expressed aware-
ness of each of them, he became aware of the teacher's
interpretation of the video. This shift in perspective made
Adam see how he talked constantly and lost focus on his
work, and he realized that he should concentrate more on his
work. When he said this he seemed to be a bit disappointed
Holmqvist Olander and Burman 5
and lowered his head. It was obvious that this was some-
thing he had heard the teachers say to him quite often. When
he was asked what he meant, he could not find an answer,
but said after a moment that he should be quieter. As he
seemed disappointed in himself, the situation was changed
to make him feel more comfortable. Another film clip
showed Adam working diligently. Although he was still
talking quite a bit and often, this time he talked about what
he was doing or was going to do. The contrast between the
clips was clear. He looked happier and he commented that
he worked better when he was concentrating on his work,
even though he was talking. It seemed that Adam needed to
verbalize his thoughts, and did not seem to be aware that in
some cases he was disturbing the rest of the class with his
loud talking. When viewing the videos, the teacher and
Adam discussed (a) the student's loud and careless way of
talking, (b) the difference between thinking and talking, (c)
the propriety of talking about the task at hand, and (d) the
possibility of working without speaking. When the discus-
sion was finished and he was asked about what he had
learned, Adam replied, "I must concentrate and work qui-
etly, but I can talk about what I am doing right at the
moment." He had apparently always been told, by different
adults and in different ways, that he should be quiet and con-
centrate, but no one had really sat down and tried to sort out
and clarify in detail how Adam understood this and what he
should do instead. Because he is not severely mentally
retarded, people seemed to take for granted that he under-
stood what they meant and that he could see himself from
their perspectives, but he seemed genuinely surprised when
he saw his behavior in the video clips. The training situation
ended with a written sentence, which Adam himself com-
posed: "I'm going to concentrate and work quietly, but I can
talk about what I am doing right now," to disseminate to
interested adults in his environment. The written sentence
was an important tool for him as a reminder of how he could
transfer learning from this situation to other future situa-
tions. Observations afterward have shown that the written
sentence is a more powerful tool for him in coping with
work situations than are verbal instructions.
This changed not only the way Adam experienced his
teachers and other students, but also the way the teachers
experienced his behavior. Before seeing the video, the teach-
ers thought Adam was extremely repetitive and that he talked
aloud all the time. During the recording, the staff was respon-
sible for ensuring all the students' lunches were prepared on
time and the kitchen was left ready for a new group after-
ward. The staff would also ensure that all three students
worked with the right equipment and measured out the cor-
rect amounts of the correct ingredients. It was in many ways
a stressful situation for the staff and probably why they did
not have as much tolerance toward him as was required.
When the film was observed in a nonstressful situation, to
select a sequence showing the student's lack of communica-
tion and interaction and problems it caused, the observers
were certain that there would be many sequences to choose
from. Surprisingly, however, Adam tended to work well and
do what he was supposed to, although he did talk loudly and
constantly. Interestingly, he usually talked about what he was
doing. He was motivated during the class in which he made
his lunch. Not until he came to class in the kitchen after lunch
to do cleaning did he begin to talk about other things; when
he talked about topics other than the task at hand, then he lost
control of his movements and could not wash dishes
anymore.
Case B--Bill
The second case was designed based on the findings of the
first case, and the results that Adam and his teachers' views
were changed by the videos were seen as important to fol-
low-up. Case B, Bill, was more structured than the first, by
defining three different situations to be filmed for 20 min
each, before and after the intervention. Bill was also loud,
and the study aimed to decrease his noise-making and teach
the student to control this behavior in the structured situa-
tion. The first filmed sequence was of domestic science les-
son in a large group (B1); the second was a structured
theoretical situation in the classroom (B2), working as
usual in a small group; and the third situation was a non-
structured situation, at recess outside with other students
(B3). The structured situation (B1) was targeted, and from
this one clip each with desired and undesired behavior was
chosen, for a total of 2 min of videotape. After this, an anal-
ysis was made of all the 20-min films and his desired and
undesired behaviors were counted to see whether they
increased or decreased after the intervention, and whether
there were any differences in his behavior attributable to
the different situations. The first film began with Bill at
rest. He started to work very well, moving as he liked, and
there were no demands on him. The observation situation,
with a person following him with a camera, seemed a bit
embarrassing for the student, and staff confirmed that the
student's behavior was unnatural and not representative of
him during the second break situation when the camera and
cameraman were present. The analysis shows that Bill's
behavior deteriorated from 3 to 7, to 10 deviations from
pre-intervention to post intervention, to 6-month follow-up
when he was filmed during this situation. When he was in
the classroom with his regular classmates, the unwanted
behavior decreased after the learning situation from eight
incidents to none. However, at the follow-up after 6 months
three incidents were noted, but as he was going to change
schools in a few weeks he was likely at a higher level of
stress at the follow-up. In the structured practical situation,
the student, even though he was in a group of students other
than his own classmates, and although he had different
assistants on each film, greatly enhanced his performance
from 37 deviations to 6 after the learning situation and only
3 at the follow-up 6 months later (Table 1).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to compare in what ways two dif-
ferent cases to the use of self-monitoring videotapes for
developing social skills in adolescents with ASD facilitates
their social behavior studied at a micro-level approach
(Lavrakas, 2008). The point of departure was variation the-
ory (Marton & Booth, 1997). Based on the conjectures of the
theoretical framework, the desired behavior was made dis-
cernible by contrasting the undesired and the desired behav-
ior to see the difference at the same time by the use of varying
the way the respondents did behave. The situation and person
(the respondent) were the same (invariant). The video
sequences from different times but showing the same kind of
situations, but showing the students behaving in different
ways. Before Adam and Bill saw themselves on the film,
they were not expressly aware of their own behavior. By that,
it was difficult to understand what the teachers wanted them
to change as the thought they did behave more or less as they
were told to. When they were shown the wanted and
unwanted behaviors, it seemed to clarify things they had
already been asked to do or not to do several times during
their school years. Previous studies of VM have shown posi-
tive results in students' behavior, as they copy and adopt the
modeled behavior in the video. In this case, both students
thought they were already acting in the desired way, and did
not understand what they were being asked to change. The
question in these two case studies was how to make them
aware of their actual behavior and learn to change it. The
design in this study was based on variation theory, and
aspects of the different behaviors were made discernible by
the use of contrast. The teachers used an edited film of differ-
ent behaviors to make Adam and Bill aware of the difference
between unwanted and wanted behaviors. When the students
were shown exemplary behavior immediately followed by a
contrasting film with the unwanted behavior, they could see
the clear contrast and assimilate the knowledge of how to
behave in different situations.
There seems to be a kind of transfer in this kind of learn-
ing, as found in other studies that have shown how students
could later relate to the films and correct their own behavior
(Greatz et al., 2006). Transfer has also been found in studies
based on variation theory, called generative learning
(Holmqvist, Gustavsson, & Wernberg, 2007). The analysis
of the films shows that Adam became aware of the learning
situation and surprised when he saw his deviance in an edited
film. He was positive and happy, however, when he next saw
the film with the desired behavior of his working an exem-
plary way. The contrast was clear and helped the student to
see the difference. In Case B, Bill was helped by the learning
situation for at least 6 months, reducing his deviant behavior
from 37 to 3 in the kitchen (practical instruction) and from 8
to 3 in the classroom, and could also generalize that learning
to other school situations.
In conclusion, Adam and Bill could clearly see the con-
trast in their behavior when shown the clips of themselves in
direct succession. They seem to have increased awareness,
become more conscious, and been able to assimilate this new
knowledge of themselves and to change their behavior for
the better in theoretical and practical structured situations.
Bill's behavior in the unstructured break situation showed
that he viewed being followed by a cameraman as an abnor-
mal and uncomfortable situation. This was not very surpris-
ing, because Bill was usually free of demands during recess
and able to behave as he liked, while being filmed made him
self-conscious and disturbed his natural way of acting. In the
structured situations, he was used to having demands and
being observed, and the teachers found him to behave as
usual during filming of these parts. The method of social
review in a design using clips of desired and undesired
behavior improved the students' awareness of their behavior
and their willingness and ability to change it.
The limitations and shortcomings of this study is the small
number of students; however, in this case, the aim was to fol-
low Adam and Bill during a long period of time and with a
micro-level approach. Moreover, we had no controls, which
would seem impossible, as people with this diagnosis are all
very different. Even if it seems that the contrast in behaviors
shown by the two different clips allows the students to
achieve the insight and new knowledge that allows them to
change their behavior, the results have to be followed-up in
future research with other respondents in different ages and
with other symptoms. The method of filming with a video
camera and editing the film on the computer, however, was
difficult and would not be possible for all teachers to accom-
plish. It required technical equipment, all the different com-
ponents of which had to be compatible with each other, as
well as special editing software to be installed on the com-
puters. If it could be made more user-friendly to teachers and
other personal, this method could be used in several situa-
tions where changed behavior is required, from school to
forensic psychiatric care.

The conclusion is that using the method and base it on a
theory on learning (variation theory) also provides an oppor-
tunity for exchange between the students and teachers, which
may (based on their spontaneous remarks) increase the
teachers' understanding of the students. However, this also
needs to be studied further, as such a claim cannot be made
by this limited study. Even if it is time-consuming to edit the
film on the computer, the results in a long-term perspective
are worth it as the behavior monitored in high degree is expe-
rienced as bothering in the environment. Ayres and Langone
(2005) asked how the positive results of using video can be
used by the teachers. One powerful direction for future
research is to study more cases and based on the results
develop some kind of software helping the teachers to create
video clips for instructional purposes used to decrease
socially obstructive behavior making integration easier in the
future as people with ASD could easier understand what we
mean in a concrete way that complement the verbal instruc-
tions. Building bridges between our different understandings
of the same situation might facilitate the integration in
society.
