The Interplay of Work and Caregiving:
Relationships Between Role Satisfaction,
Role Involvement, and Caregivers' Well-being

This study applied theory from the general work and family literature to the dual roles of work and caregiving, in
order to examine whether level of satisfaction and time involvement in each of these roles moderate the effects of
stress in the other role on well-being. Respondents were 118 employed women who were providing care to an
impaired parent or parent-in-law. As predicted, greater time involvement in work was found to buffer women from
the negative effects of caregiving stress. Satisfaction with caregiving and satisfaction with work were directly associ-
ated with better well-being, beyond the effects of stress in both roles. However, women who experienced high levels
of caregiving stress and who were highly satisfied with work were especially vulnerable to depression. These find-
ings illustrate the importance of examining the effects of caregiving stress on well-being in the context of
work-related experiences.
DATA from a national survey of informal caregivers
indicate that adult daughters and daughters-in-law
constitute an important group of family members to pro-
vide care to impaired older adults (Stone, Cafferata, and
Sangl, 1987). Many of these women have additional family
responsibilities, and almost half (44%) are also employed
(Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). The continuing growth
in the number of women in the labor force (U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor, Women's Bureau, 1994), along with the
large number of older adults needing long-term assistance
now and in the future, has made the consequences of com-
bining work and caregiving an increasing concern to
researchers and policymakers (Stone and Short, 1990).
An emerging literature indicates that employment can be
beneficial to the well-being of caregivers to an older
impaired parent. Employed caregivers often experience
less caregiver strain and better mental health than those
who are not employed (Giele, Mutschler, and Orodenker,
1987; Miller, 1989; Skaff and Pearlin, 1992). However,
most studies of employed caregivers have been limited
because they focus solely on occupancy of the employment
role and not on experiences in that role. Little is known
about how experiences in these two roles combine to affect
caregivers' well-being. The primary purpose of the present
study was to determine how these two roles interact by
examining specific aspects of one role that may condition
the effects on well-being of stress in the other role.
The caregiver and employee roles each have the potential
to be stressful. It is well established that providing care to
an impaired older adult can produce a substantial amount of
stress for family caregivers (e.g., Zarit, 1989). The stressful-
ness of caregiving most commonly stems from dealing with
the care-recipient's cognitive and behavioral problems, and
providing assistance with activities of daily living (Haley
et al., 1987; Kinney and Stephens, 1989; Stephens, Franks,
and Townsend, 1994). Although being employed seems to
be generally beneficial for women's health (Baruch, Biener,
and Barnett, 1987; Repetti, Matthews, and Waldron, 1989;
Ross and Mirowsky, 1995), this role can also be stressful.
Occupational stressors that have been shown to have the
greatest negative impact on women's well-being are a heavy
workload (e.g., Barnett, Davidson, and Marshall, 1991), low
job control or little decision-making authority, and mo-
notonous work (Repetti, Matthews, and Waldron, 1989).
Therefore, it is possible that employed caregivers are in two
stressful roles simultaneously.
In addition to the stressors experienced in these two
roles, the positive aspects of caregiving and work are
increasingly acknowledged. Family members can derive
many rewards from caregiving, such as comfort in know-
ing that one's parent is well cared for and an increased
sense of mastery from meeting the challenges of caregiving
(e.g., Lawton et al., 1989; Miller, 1989; Motenko, 1989;
Scharlach, 1994). Rewards experienced in caregiving have
been shown to be related to better well-being for care-
givers even when stress in that role and in two other roles
(mother and wife) is considered (Stephens, Franks, and
Townsend, 1994). Likewise, the literature on employment
and women's health indicates that work has many potential
benefits that are related to enhanced well-being, including
the receipt of social support from co-workers (e.g., Hibbard
and Pope, 1985) and increased self-esteem (e.g., Pugliesi,
1989).
Research has shown that experiences in one role can
often spill over to affect experiences in another role, both
positively and negatively. These spillover effects may be
particularly relevant for the domains of work and family
(Bolger et al., 1989; Bromet, Dew, and Parkinson, 1990).
Specifically, investigations of women's multiple roles have
demonstrated that experiences in family and work roles not
S279
S280 MARTIREETAL.
only have direct effects on women's health (e.g., Barnett
and Baruch, 1985; Baruch and Barnett, 1986), but that
experiences in each domain can moderate the effects of
experiences in the other. Positive experiences in marital and
parental roles have been shown to buffer the negative
effects of low job quality on women's psychological
well-being (Barnett, 1994), and rewarding experiences on
the job have been shown to buffer the negative effects of
family stress on women's psychological well-being (Bar-
nett and Marshall, 1991; Barnett, Marshall, and Sayer,
1992). The evidence for role spillover between the domains
of work and family suggests that this theory might be use-
fully applied to the roles of work and caregiving. That is, it
is possible that the satisfying aspects of the caregiver role
could help to offset the effects of stress at work, and that
the satisfying aspects of work could help to offset the
effects of caregiving stress.
In addition to role satisfaction, the time that a woman is
involved in a given role has been shown to affect her
well-being. Previous research reveals that not only is
employment generally beneficial for the well-being of both
men and women, but also that full-time employment (35 or
more hours per week) is particularly beneficial (Anesh-
ensel, Frerichs, and Clark, 1981) and is associated with less
depression than part-time employment (Gore and Man-
gione, 1983; Wethington and Kessler, 1989). It has been
suggested that the advantage of full-time employment may
be due to a greater opportunity to achieve the full benefits
that this role has to offer, including higher pay, more fringe
benefits, and greater opportunities for advancement (Herold
and Waldron, 1985; Vecchio, 1984). For employed care-
givers, time spent at work may also provide them with
respite from stress at home, including stress from providing
care to an impaired relative (Brody, 1990). Caregivers who
work more than 20 hours per week have been shown to
experience less stress from caregiving than caregivers who
work less than 20 hours per week (Enright and Friss, 1987).
However, these findings may have been due to the fact
that the caregivers working more hours had less impaired
care-recipients, provided less care, and received more paid
assistance with caregiving.
In contrast to the beneficial aspects of time spent in the
employment role, there is evidence that greater involve-
ment in the caregiver role may be detrimental to women's
health. Prior research on employed caregivers indicates that
a greater number of hours spent caregiving is associated
with poorer well-being, including increased stress from
caregiving (Neal et al., 1993) and increased role strain
(Scharlach and Fredriksen, 1994). Other research has found
that the combination of providing more hours of help and
occupying other roles (e.g., employee, wife, and parent) is
associated with increased caregiver burden (Stoller and
Pugliesi, 1989). Given the findings regarding the direct
effects of involvement in caregiving and employment on
well-being, it is possible that involvement in one role could
moderate the effects of stress in the other role.
The objective of the present study was to examine the
effects of role satisfaction and role involvement on the
well-being (physical health, depression, and positive affect)
of women who simultaneously occupy the roles of employee
and caregiver to an impaired parent or parent-in-law. There
were three hypotheses concerning role satisfaction, and
the first two focused on moderating effects. Based on evi-
dence that positive experiences in the family (or work)
domain buffer the negative effects of stress in the work (or
family) domain (e.g., Barnett, 1994; Barnett and Marshall,
1991), it was predicted that the effects of caregiving stress
on well-being would be buffered by satisfactions experi-
enced at work and that the effects of work stress on
well-being would be buffered by satisfaction in the caregiv-
er role. That is, it was posited that stress in each of these
roles would be associated with poorer well-being at low
levels of satisfaction in the other role but not at high levels
of satisfaction in the other role. It was further predicted
that, in addition to its moderating effects, satisfaction in a
role (either work or caregiving) would be related to better
well-being.
Three additional hypotheses focused on role involvement
(amount of time spent in a role). Based on evidence that
employed caregivers benefit from working a greater num-
ber of hours but not from providing more hours of care to
an impaired relative (e.g., Enright and Friss, 1987; Neal et
al., 1993), it was predicted that the effects of caregiving
stress on well-being would be buffered by greater work
involvement (i.e., working more hours), and that the effects
of work stress on well-being would be exacerbated by
greater involvement in the caregiver role (i.e., providing
more hours of care). That is, it was posited that stress in the
caregiving role would be related to poorer well-being at
low work hours but not at high work hours, and that stress
in the work role would be related to poorer well-being at
high caregiving hours but not at low caregiving hours. It
was further predicted that greater involvement in a role
(either work or caregiving) would be directly related to
well-being. That is, based on evidence that women who
work full-time experience better well-being but that care-
givers who provide more hours of care experience poorer
well-being (e.g., Neal et al., 1993; Wethington and Kessler,
1989), involvement in the work role was hypothesized to
have beneficial effects on well-being, whereas involvement
in the caregiver role was predicted to have negative effects
on well-being.
METHOD
Respondents
Respondents were 118 women who were caregivers to
an ill or disabled parent or parent-in-law, and who were
employed at least 10 hours per week. To be eligible for this
study, a woman had to assist her parent with at least one of
the following: personal care, shopping, preparing meals, or
providing supervision to the parent due to a memory prob-
lem. In addition, the impaired parent had to be at least 60
years of age and reside in a noninstitutional setting.
Respondents were recruited through newspaper solicita-
tions, discharge records at a local rehabilitation hospital,
Alzheimer's Association chapters, and national newsletters
published specifically for caregivers. Eligible caregivers
who agreed to participate were mailed a questionnaire
THE INTERPLAY OF WORK AND CAREGIVING S281
booklet. A total of 168 questionnaires were mailed to eligi-
ble respondents, and 127 questionnaires (76%) were
returned; 9 of these questionnaires contained unusable or
incomplete data. Of the 118 respondents available for anal-
ysis, 107 were daughters and 11 were daughters-in-law.
The average age of the respondents was 48.5 years (SD =
7.7; range = 30-67). Approximately 91 percent of respon-
dents were Caucasian. Respondents had received an aver-
age of 15.3 years of education (SD = 2.8; range = 12-23).
Approximately 73 percent of the respondents were married,
and they had been married for an average of 23.6 years (SD
= 10.1; range = 2^44). Less than half (44%) of the respon-
dents had at least one child living at home, and the average
age of the youngest child at home was 16.1 years. The
median level of the respondents' yearly household income
was between $50,000 and $60,000. Slightly less than half
(44%) shared a residence with the parent or parent-in-law.
The average age of the impaired parent or parent-in-law
was 79.7 years (SD = 7.1; range = 61-94). Most of the par-
ents (in-law) were female (85.6%). Parents (in-law) had
required assistance for an average of 6.0 years (SD = 6.52;
range = .25-40) and respondents had been providing care
for an average of 5.7 years (SD = 6.22; range = .25^40).
Respondents indicated that 93.2 percent of the parents
(in-law) required at least some help with shopping for gro-
ceries or doing their own housework; 74.6 percent required
help with preparing meals, and 55.9 percent needed assis-
tance with bathing. Additionally, 51.7 percent of the parents
(in-law) needed assistance with understanding simple
instructions, and 43.2 percent needed assistance with accu-
rately reporting the day of the week. Of the 12 instrumental
tasks examined in this study, caregivers were assisting their
parent (in-law) with an average of 8.8. More than half
(61.9%) of the respondents reported receiving assistance
with caregiving from other family members or friends, and
52.5 percent reported using paid help with caregiving.
Instruments
Two general principles were used in designing the role
stress and role satisfaction measures. First, two sources of
information were used in identifying important experiences
in these two roles: empirical investigations using measures
that were developed from ethnographic interviews with
individuals who occupied these roles, and reviews of
empirical research on employment and caregiving. Ethno-
graphic interviews (i.e., those using open-ended questions)
were particularly useful for designing measures of role
stress and role satisfaction because they reflect the perspec-
tives of individuals who are experiencing both problematic
and rewarding events in these roles. Second, nonoverlap-
ping items were chosen for the stress and satisfaction mea-
sures within each role in an attempt to ensure that these
measures reflected two dimensions of role-related experi-
ences that were distinct and not simply polar opposites of
each other.
Role stress. -- The measure of caregiving stress consisted
of caregivers' appraisals of 21 tasks often performed by adult
child caregivers in response to the care-recipient's physical
and cognitive impairment (e.g., arranging services for your
parent) (Albert, 1991; Stephens and Kinney, 1989). For each
task, the respondent was asked to indicate if she had per-
formed that task in the past month and, if so, how stressful
that had been, using a 4-point scale (ranging from 1 "not at
all" to 4 "very"). Those tasks that caregivers reported not
having performed were scored as "0" (did not happen). Our
objective was to create a caregiving stress measure which
excluded events that a respondent had not experienced in the
past month, had never experienced, or that were irrelevant to
her situation. We were concerned only with the appraisal of
events that had occurred. Thus, a caregiving stress score rep-
resenting the average amount of stress experienced was cal-
culated by summing the ratings across items and dividing by
the number of items endorsed as having occurred in the past
month, the same procedure as used in our earlier research
(e.g., Stephens, Franks, and Townsend, 1994). The mean
caregiving stress score was 2.41 (SD = .54; range = 1-3.94).
The mean number of items endorsed as having occurred in
the past month was 15.9 (SD = 4.47; range = 2-21). Cron-
bach's alpha for caregiving stress was .88.
Work stress was assessed with seven items pertaining to
common stressors experienced by women at work (e.g.,
Having more work than you can handle). These items were
taken from previous research (Barnett and Baruch, 1985;
Kandel, Davies, and Raveis, 1985; Pearlin and Schooler,
1978; Veroff, Douvan, and Kulka, 1981). For each item, the
respondent was asked to indicate if that circumstance
applied to her work situation and, if so, how stressful it had
been, using a 4-point scale (ranging from 1 "not at all" to 4
"very"). Items that caregivers reported as not applying to
their work situation were scored as "0" (does not apply). A
work stress score representing the average amount of stress
experienced was calculated by summing the ratings across
items and dividing by the number of items endorsed as
being applicable. The mean work stress score was 2.29 (SD
= .80; range = 1-4). The mean number of items endorsed as
having occurred in the past month was 5.0 (SD = 2.00;
range = 1-7). Cronbach's alpha for this measure was .77.
Role satisfaction. -- Caregiving satisfaction was assessed
using five items from a caregiving satisfaction scale (e.g.,
Helping your parent makes you feel closer to him/her) (Law-
ton et al, 1989). Each item was rated on a 4-point scale rang-
ing from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree," and scores
were created by summing across the ratings for all items.
The mean level of caregiving satisfaction was 15.26 (SD =
3.24; range = 5-20) and Cronbach's alpha was .84.
Work satisfaction was assessed using eight items derived
from previous studies (e.g., Your job is enjoyable; Barnett
and Baruch, 1985; Moos, 1986; Repetti, 1987; Veroff, Dou-
van, and Kulka, 1981). Each item was rated on a 4-point
scale from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree," and
scores were created by summing across the ratings for all
items. The mean level of work satisfaction was 22.35 (SD =
4.41; range = 8-32). Cronbach's alpha for this measure
was .80.
Role involvement. -- Role involvement was assessed as
the number of hours per week spent carrying out the respon-
sibilities of a role. Respondents were asked to indicate the
S282 MARTIRE ETAL.
number of hours per week that they spent assisting their par-
ent and the number of hours per week that they were
employed. The average number of hours per week spent
caregiving was 22.78 (SD = 25.68; range = 2-128). The
average number of work hours per week was 36.59 (SD =
9.12; range = 10-62). Almost three-quarters (70%) of the
respondents worked 35 or more hours per week (full-time).
Physical health. -- The physical health of respondents
was assessed using the sum of three items, each rated on a
4-point scale. Respondents were asked to rate: (1) their cur-
rent health (ranging from 1 "poor" to 4 "excellent"); (2) the
extent to which their daily activities are limited by their
health (ranging from 1 "a great deal" to 4 "not at all"); and
(3) their satisfaction with their health (ranging from 1 "not
at all satisfied" to 4 "completely satisfied") (House, 1986).
The mean physical health score was 9.72 (SD = 2.00; range
= 4-12), and the alpha coefficient for this measure was .85.
Depression. -- The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-
Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) was used to
assess depressive symptoms. The CES-D is a 20-item scale
that asks respondents to indicate how frequently they expe-
rienced certain symptoms or feelings during the past week.
Scores can range from 0 to 60, with higher scores reflecting
greater symptomatology. A cutoff score of 16 on the
CES-D is indicative of a risk for clinical depression.
Approximately 44 percent of the present sample scored at
or above this cutoff. The average depression score was
16.83 (SD = 12.79; range 0-51), and the alpha coefficient
for this measure was .94.
Positive affect. -- The positive affect subscale of the
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson,
Clark, and Tellegen, 1988) was used to assess positive emo-
tions. Items in this subscale ask the respondent to rate the
experience of 10 positive feelings and emotions experi-
enced during the past week on a 5-point scale (ranging
from 1 "very slightly or not at all" to 5 "extremely"). The
average positive affect score was 32.44 (SD = 8.03; range =
14-^-9). Cronbach's alpha for this measure was .91.
Analysis Plan
For each index of well-being a hierarchical multiple
regression analysis was used to test for the moderating
effects of satisfaction (or involvement) in one role on the
relationship between stress in the other role and well-being.
In all analyses, stress in the moderating role was controlled.
This strategy was used to increase confidence in the inter-
pretation that any observed moderation effects are due to
role satisfaction or role involvement and are not due to dif-
ferential levels of stress for those respondents at high and
low levels of the moderator. The sample size of approxi-
mately 118 respondents provided adequate power (.80) to
detect an interaction effect for a model in which the effect
accounted for 5 percent of the variance and the total
amount of variance accounted for was approximately 25
percent (Jaccard, Turrisi, and Wan, 1990).
For the analyses examining work involvement as a
potential moderator, three additional control variables were
used: caregiving hours, parent (in-law)'s level of cognitive
and functional impairment, and hours of paid assistance
with caregiving. These control variables were included in
order to ensure that any observed moderation effects of
work hours would not be due to such factors (e.g., fewer
hours of care). These factors were shown by other research
to distinguish between caregivers who worked a high num-
ber of hours per week and caregivers who worked a low
number of hours per week (Enright and Friss, 1987).
In order to determine whether any other control variables
should be included in the regression equations, bivariate
correlation coefficients between 18 demographic or care-
giving-related variables (e.g., age, income, marital status,
number of children living at home, the age of the parent
(in-law), the cognitive and functional impairment of the
parent (in-law), duration of caregiving, whether the care-
giver and parent (in-law) shared a household), and the pre-
dictor, moderator, and criterion variables were examined. A
variable would be chosen as a control variable for a given
equation if it correlated > .30 (Reichardt, 1979) with the
criterion variable and either the predictor or moderator vari-
able. None of the correlation coefficients met these criteria.
Based on these findings, no additional control variables
were included in the regression analyses.
In each regression analysis, control variable(s) were
entered first (including stress in the moderating role), fol-
lowed by stress in the other role, role satisfaction or role
involvement, and the interaction of stress with satisfaction
or involvement. For example, when examining the moder-
ating effects of work satisfaction on the relationship be-
tween caregiving stress and well-being, the control variable
of work stress entered the equation first, caregiving stress
entered the equation second, work satisfaction entered
third, and the interaction of caregiving stress with work
satisfaction entered the equation last. Significant standard-
ized regression coefficients (3) for moderators were indica-
tive of main effects of these variables (average simple
effects; Aiken and West, 1991). Moderating effects were
indicated by interaction terms that added a significant
amount of variance to a model past the main effects (Baron
and Kenny, 1986; Cohen and Cohen, 1983).
In order to reduce the potential for multicollinearity
between the interaction term and the component parts of this
term, centered scores for stress and role satisfaction or
involvement were used in these analyses (Cohen and Cohen,
1983; Jaccard, Turrisi, and Wan, 1990). That is, deviation
scores were created for each respondent by subtracting the
sample mean for that scale from the individual's original
score. In addition, the decomposition of significant interac-
tion effects was carried out by examining the slope of
well-being on stress at high and low levels of the moderator
(one standard deviation above and below the mean, respec-
tively), using unstandardized regression coefficients (Aiken
and West, 1991; Jaccard, Turrisi, and Wan, 1990).
RESULTS
Role Stress and Role Satisfaction
The percentages of respondents endorsing the stress and
satisfaction items within the caregiving and work roles are
THE INTERPLAY OF WORKAND CAREGIVING S283
presented in Tables 1 and 2. For role stressors, these tables
show the percentages of respondents who endorsed each
item as at least slightly stressful. For role satisfactions,
these tables show the percentages of respondents who
agreed or strongly agreed with each item.
Of the 21 caregiving stress items, 15 were endorsed by at
least half of the respondents, and 8 were endorsed by at
least two-thirds of the respondents (shown in Table 1).
These stressors involved dealing with the parent's moods
and irritating behaviors, and making decisions about and
arranging services for the parent. Table 1 also shows that
out of the five caregiving satisfaction items, all were
endorsed by at least two-thirds of the respondents. The top
two satisfactions related to vicariously experiencing the
parent's pleasure and meeting family obligations.
Table 2 shows the rank order of the seven work stress
items and eight work satisfaction items. The two most fre-
quently endorsed work stressors pertained to the amount of
work a woman had to do. Almost half of the respondents
(49.2%) reported being unable to have control over things
they do at work as a stressor. Having an enjoyable job was
the most frequently endorsed work satisfaction, followed by
satisfaction with amount of support from closest coworker.
The zero-order correlation coefficients among the inde-
pendent and dependent measures are presented in Table 3.
With the exception of the relationship between caregiving
satisfaction and work stress (r = -.20, p < .05), the vari-
ables that were examined as potential moderators in this
study -- caregiving satisfaction, work satisfaction, caregiv-
ing hours, and work hours -- were not significantly related
to the stress measures that they were proposed to moderate.
This condition provides a more interpretable interaction

term (Baron and Kenny, 1986). In addition, the satisfaction
and hours variables within roles were not significantly
related to each other, indicating that these potential modera-
tors were assessing different constructs.
Role Satisfaction and Weil-Being
The findings regarding the analyses of role satisfaction as
a potential moderator of role stress on well-being are
shown in Table 4. This table displays effects that were
detected at the last step of each analysis, for each index of
well-being. The top half of the table displays analyses of
caregiving satisfaction as a potential buffer of work stress,
and the bottom half displays the analyses of work satisfac-
tion as a potential buffer of caregiving stress. As stated pre-
viously, significant regression coefficients for the moderator
variables indicate main effects of these variables; moderat-
ing effects are indicated by interaction terms that add a sig-
nificant amount of variance to a model past the the main
effects. Results indicated that all models for role satisfac-
tion were significant at or beyond the .01 level, and the
total amount of variance in well-being accounted for ranged
from 13 to 35 percent.
Main effects. -- Role satisfaction emerged as a signifi-
cant main effect in five out of six analyses. The regression
coefficients indicated that satisfaction in the caregiver role
was associated with better physical health and more posi-
tive affect, and satisfaction in the work role was significant-
ly related to better physical health, less depression, and

more positive affect. These effects emerged independent of
caregiving stress, work stress, and the interaction terms.
Moderating effects. -- No significant buffering effects
were found for caregiving satisfaction on the relationship
between work stress and well-being. That is, satisfaction in
the caregiver role did not interact significantly with work
stress for any index of well-being. In addition, no signifi-
cant interactions were found between work satisfaction and
caregiving stress in analyses of physical health and positive
affect. However, a significant interaction effect was found
between work satisfaction and caregiving stress in the anal-
ysis of depression. This interaction term accounted for an
additional 2.22 percent of the variance past the main effects
and effects of the control variable.
A decomposition analysis was conducted for this interac-
tion to determine the significance of the slope of depression
on caregiving stress at low work satisfaction (one standard
deviation below the mean, equivalent to a role satisfaction
score of 17.94) and high work satisfaction (one standard
deviation above the mean, equivalent to a role satisfaction
score of 26.76). The slope of depression on caregiving
stress was significantly different from zero at both low
work satisfaction (b = 5.56, p < .05) and high work satis-
faction (b = 12.58, p < .05). The sign of these significant
coefficients indicated that higher caregiving stress was
related to a greater level of depression for women reporting
low or high work satisfaction, with a much stronger rela-
tionship between caregiving stress and depression for those
women reporting high work satisfaction. This finding was
not consistent with that predicted by our hypothesis, which
stated that a significant slope of caregiving stress on
depression would be found only for those women who were
less satisfied at work. As Figure 1 shows, a significant rela-
tionship between caregiving stress and well-being was
found at both low and high levels of work satisfaction, and
caregiving stress had a much greater impact on depression
for those women with high work satisfaction than for those
women with low work satisfaction. However, it is also
important to note that although women with low work sat-
isfaction did not experience such elevated levels of depres-
sion at high levels of caregiving stress, this group experi-
enced greater overall levels of depression than women who
were highly satisfied with work, r(116) = 3.07, p < .01. The
mean level of depression for the low work satisfaction
group was 20.5 (SD = 13.52), whereas the mean level of

depression for the high work satisfaction group was 13.5
(SD= 11.20).
Role Involvement and Weil-Being
Table 5 presents the effects found in the analyses of role
involvement as a potential moderator. As in Table 4, this
table displays effects that were detected at the last step of
each analysis. The top half of the table displays the analy-
ses of caregiving involvement as a potential exacerbator of
work stress, and the bottom half of the table displays the
analyses of work involvement as a potential buffer of care-
giving stress. With the exception of the equation for care-
giving involvement and positive affect, all models were
significant at or beyond the .01 level, and the total amount
of variance in well-being accounted for in the models that
reached significance ranged from 7 to 29 percent.

are equivalent to one standard deviation below the mean for those vari-

Main effects. -- Only one significant main effect was
found for either work or caregiving involvement. However,
the sign of the regression coefficient for this main effect
was in an unexpected direction. Number of work hours was
significantly related to less positive affect in the analyses of
work involvement as a potential moderator.
Moderating effects. -- No significant moderating effects
were found for caregiving involvement on the relationship
between work stress and well-being. In contrast, significant
buffering effects of work hours on the relationship between
caregiving stress and well-being were found for all three
well-being indices, controlling for work stress, caregiving
hours, parent's level of impairment, and hours of paid assis-
tance with caregiving. These interactions accounted for an
additional 6.10 percent to 8.82 percent of the variance in
well-being. The interaction between work hours and care-
giving stress on depression is depicted in Figure 2. Graphs
for the other interaction terms had similar interpretations.
As Figure 2 shows, a high level of caregiving stress was not
related to greater depression for those women working a
high number of hours, but high caregiving stress was asso-
ciated with greater depression for those women working a
low number of hours.
Decomposition analyses were conducted for each signifi-
cant interaction effect to determine the significance of the
slope of well-being on caregiving stress at low work hours
(one standard deviation below the mean, equivalent to 27.5
hours worked per week) and high work hours (one standard
deviation above the mean, equivalent to 45.7 hours worked
per week). The slope of physical health on caregiving stress
was significantly different from zero at a low number of
work hours (b = -1.98, p < .05), but not at a high number of
work hours (b = -.36). The sign of the significant coefficient
indicated that more caregiving stress was associated with
poorer physical health for those working a low number of
hours. In regard to depression, decomposition of this signifi-

cant interaction indicated that the slope of depression on
caregiving stress was significantly different from zero at low
work hours (b = 14.74, p < .05) but not at high work hours

Analysis of the interaction effect for positive affect showed
that the slope of positive affect on caregiving stress was sig-
nificantly different from zero at a low number of work hours
(b = -6.47, p < .05), but not at a high number of work hours

DISCUSSION
Results from the present study provide evidence that
experiences in the work role can moderate the effects of
caregiving stress on women's well-being. As predicted,
women who worked a greater number of hours were
buffered from the deleterious effects of caregiving stress,
and these results were found for all three indices of
well-being. Although women who were more satisfied at
work experienced fewer depressive symptoms than women
who were less satisfied, high work satisfaction was associ-
ated with much greater levels of depression under high lev-
els of caregiving stress. Furthermore, satisfaction in both
the caregiving and work roles was directly related to
greater well-being even after controlling for the level of
stress experienced in these roles.
The findings that most strongly supported our hypothesis
concerning role involvement were found for the domain of
work. For those women who worked part-time, higher lev-
els of caregiving stress were related to poorer physical
health, greater depression, and less positive affect. In con-
trast, for those women who worked full-time, there was no
association between higher caregiving stress and poorer
physical health, greater depression, or less positive affect.
The protective effects of full-time employment found for
women involved in parent care may have several explana-
tions. First, these effects may be due to the greater amount
of time away from caregiving that working more hours pro-
vides. As suggested by others (e.g., Brody, 1990; Scharlach,
1994), time spent at work may provide women with
much-needed respite or distraction from the responsibilities
of caregiving. Second, it is possible that the advantage of
full-time work stems from the greater financial, social, and
psychological resources it provides over part-time work.
Full-time workers often receive higher pay, have more
fringe benefits, and have greater opportunities for career
advancement than part-time workers (Herold and Waldron,
1985; Vecchio, 1984). In addition, it has been suggested
that full-time workers more fully participate in the social
life of the workplace and have more access to supportive
social relationships with co-workers (Wethington and
Kessler, 1989).
Other research on employed caregivers has also found
beneficial effects of full-time work for caregivers when com-
pared to part-time work (Enright and Friss, 1987). In this
research, however, other factors -- such as hours of care,
impairment of the care-recipient, and hours of paid assis-
tance -- may have accounted for those findings. Given that
the present study found that work involvement buffered the
effects of caregiving stress even after controlling for these
factors, our conclusion -- that the beneficial effects of
full-time employment are due to the greater amount of
respite and resources gained -- is strengthened.
Our hypotheses regarding the main effects of role in-
volvement were not supported. No main effects were
found for caregiving involvement. Greater work involve-
ment was found to be related to only one index of well-
being, and this relationship was opposite to our prediction.
A higher number of work hours was related to less (rather
than more) positive affect. This finding also contradicts
research in the larger literature on women's work, which
shows that full-time work is more beneficial for women
than part-time work (Wethington and Kessler, 1989). How-
ever, this finding is somewhat consistent with other re-
search on employed caregivers, which has found that care-
givers who are employed a greater number of hours also
experience more global stress and more difficulty combin-
ing work and family (Gottlieb, Kelloway, and Fraboni,
1994; Neal et al., 1993). Our findings suggest that whereas
working more hours may help to protect against the effects
of caregiving stress, overall it is also associated with less
positive affect.
We found mixed evidence for the protective effects of
work satisfaction. As predicted, low work satisfaction was
associated with greater depression under conditions of high
caregiving stress. This finding is consistent with the re-
search of others regarding the buffering effects of work
rewards on stressful family experiences (Barnett and Mar-
shall, 1991; Barnett, Marshall, and Sayer, 1992). Contrary
to our prediction, higher levels of depression were also
found for those women who were highly satisfied with
work, and this relationship between higher caregiving stress
and greater depression was much stronger than that ob-
served for women who were less satisfied with work. How-
ever, it is important to note that overall, and especially for
women with low levels of caregiving stress, work satisfac-
THE INTERPLAY OF WORK AND CAREGIVING S287
tion did provide protective effects against increased depres-
sion. Our findings suggest that it is the combination of
being very satisfied with work and having high levels of
caregiving stress that is associated with particularly high
levels of depression.
It may be that women who are both satisfied with their
work and stressed by caregiving responsibilities are also
more depressed because of the conflict they perceive
between these two roles. Experiencing greater job satisfac-
tion may indicate that employment is more central to a
woman's self-concept. Having a job that is important or
salient to the self has been found to be associated with
higher levels of perceived work-family conflict (Greenhaus
et al., 1989). Women in our sample may have experienced
negative feelings because of perceived conflict between
caregiving and employment. In addition, the daily de-
mands of these two roles may conflict. Research has
shown that caregiving responsibilities can interfere with
employment through such means as increased absenteeism
and work interruptions (e.g., Franklin, Ames, and King,
1994; Scharlach, 1994), and such interferences may be
especially problematic for women who are highly satisfied
with their jobs.
We found stronger evidence for the direct effects of role
satisfaction than for its buffering effects. Satisfaction in
both caregiving and work was associated with greater
well-being. Regardless of the amount of stress experienced
in caregiving and work, caregiving satisfaction predicted
better physical health and positive affect, and work satisfac-
tion was associated with greater well-being for all three
well-being measures. These findings extend previous re-
search on the rewards of caregiving (Stephens, Franks, and
Townsend, 1994) by showing that satisfaction in caregiving
can predict well-being past the effects of stress in that role
and in the work role. In addition, these findings contribute
to the literature on employed caregivers by showing that
satisfactions at work can be associated with caregivers'
greater well-being.
Experiences at work appeared to have a stronger bearing
on caregiving than caregiving had on work. In contrast to
the moderating effects found for work involvement and
work satisfaction on the relationship between caregiving
stress and well-being, no moderating effects were found for
caregiving involvement or caregiving satisfaction on the
relationship between work stress and well-being. Conceptu-
alizing these interaction effects in terms of role spillover
(e.g., Barnett, 1994), it can be concluded from these find-
ings that evidence was found for spillover from work to
caregiving but not from caregiving to work. It may be that
the women in this study were better able to keep caregiving
experiences from affecting work than they were able to
keep aspects of work from affecting caregiving. Other
researchers have found evidence for women's ability to
avoid spillover from the family domain to the work domain
(e.g., Barnett and Marshall, 1992; Bolger et al., 1989).
Alternatively, it is possible that other caregiving experi-
ences not examined as potential moderators in this study do
in fact condition the effects of work stress, such as the
impairment of the older adult or the quality of the relation-
ship between the caregiver and her parent or parent-in-law.
Finally, the sample size used in the present study may not
have allowed adequate statistical power to detect all hypoth-
esized moderation effects, in particular those of smaller
magnitude (Jaccard, Turrisi, and Wan, 1990).
One limitation of the present study is its cross-sectional
design, which precludes the ability to rule out a different
causal ordering than that proposed. For example, it is possi-
ble that the relationship between caregiving stress and
decreased well-being for part-time workers occurred because
caregivers who were in poorer physical or mental health and
were more stressed from caregiving reduced the number of
hours they worked. Although the literature on employed
caregivers indicates that some women reduce their work
hours because of caregiving responsibilities (e.g., Brody et
al., 1987; Stone and Short, 1990), it is not known to what
extent this may have occurred in our sample.
Another limitation of this study may be the generalizabil-
ity of the findings to other employed caregivers, given that
respondents were self-selected. On the one hand, the cur-
rent sample may have been less stressed due to caregiving
than typical employed caregivers, given that these women
had the time available to participate in this study. On the
other hand, the women in the sample may have participated
because they were highly stressed by the experience of jug-
gling these two roles and were looking for insight into their
problems. In order to increase the representativeness of the
sample, caregivers were recruited through a variety of
sources rather than relying on a single source of recruit-
ment (Barer and Johnson, 1990).
Also, it is not known to what extent this sample is repre-
sentative of employed women caregivers in terms of level
of work involvement. The fact that three-quarters of our
respondents were employed full-time is consistent with
national figures for all employed women (U.S. Department
of Labor, Women's Bureau, 1994), but no data are currently
available on the percentage of women caregivers who work
full-time. Although data from a national survey of informal
caregivers indicated that approximately three-quarters of
employed caregivers work full-time, both male and female
caregivers were included in this survey (American Associa-
tion of Retired Persons and The Travelers Companies
Foundation, 1988). Finally, it is not known to what extent
this study's findings would generalize to employed care-
givers with other ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds,
in particular to employed caregivers with less education
and fewer economic resources.
The present study extends previous research on em-
ployed caregivers and the general literature on work and
family in several ways. First, rather than focusing on the
effects of occupancy of the employment role, the present
study identifies two particular aspects of work that can be
beneficial to caregivers' well-being. Second, in contrast to
previous research, which has shown the buffering effects of
work rewards on family stress, the present study demon-
strates that these relationships are more complex in the con-
text of caregiving. Taken together, the results of this study
support the perspective that caregivers' other roles have the
potential to enhance well-being or provide resources that
could buffer the impact of stresses associated with caregiv-
ing (Stoller and Pugliesi, 1989).
