OLDER adults who cease driving experience fewer
out-of-home activities (1), increased depression (2),
and decreased sense of control (3). Furthermore, those who
cease driving are at increased risk for long-term care insti-
tutionalization and mortality (4,5). As the percentage of
older adults comprising our population increases, health
care workers will increasingly be faced with advising older
patients about driving. Finding ways of maintaining safe
driving mobility will be of ever more concern.
Research on risk factors for driving cessation has indi-
cated that older adults who have ceased driving report
poorer health and physical abilities (6,7). Ragland and col-
leagues (8) found that older adults report concerns about
being in an accident and vision problems as reasons for self-
regulating their driving. Poor vision is a prospective risk
factor for driving cessation (8,9).
Recent evidence also highlights the importance of cognitive
abilities to maintained driving (10). Anstey and colleagues
(11) found that older drivers with poor cognitive abilities,
including speed of processing, had a higher probability of
driving cessation. Recent analyses found that slower speed of
processing was a significant risk factor for driving cessation,
even while considering baseline driving, age, health, vision,
memory, reasoning, and physical performance (10).
Ongoing research has indicated that speed of processing
can be enhanced through a computerized training regimen
(12) and that such training may improve on-road driving
safety (13) and protect against declines in driving mobility
across 3 years (14). Given that the training has resulted in
maintained driving mobility, it was of interest to examine
whether training delays the outcome of driving cessation.
The current analyses were conducted to examine whether
completing this speed of processing training regimen delays
driving cessation.
Methods
Participants
Driving cessation over a 3-year period among community-
dwelling older drivers is a relatively low-frequency event. To
gain statistical power and ensure an adequate sample size of
those who ceased driving, data from comparable populations
from two studies were combined. The first study, Staying
Keen in Later Life (SKILL), recruited relatively healthy com-
munity-dwelling older adults with intact vision and hearing
who did not have evidence of dementia or other severe cogni-
tive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]
score of 23 or better). SKILL participants were primarily
recruited via mass-mailed letters to older adults residing in
the area as well as through local senior agencies and health
clinics. Inclusion criteria for the SKILL training study
also required Useful Field of View Test (UFOV) performance
indicating risk for mobility decline (Task 2 150 ms or

Background. As our population ages, interventions that can prolong safe driving for older adults will be increasingly
important.
Methods. Data from two studies were combined in order to investigate the effectiveness of cognitive training in
delaying driving cessation. Stratified Cox hazard regressions were used to examine risk of driving cessation as a function
of training participation, baseline driving, and visual acuity.
Results. Older drivers with cognitive speed of processing difficulties who completed speed of processing training
were 40% less likely to cease driving over the subsequent 3 years (hazard ratio = 0.596, 95% confidence interval
0.356­0.995, p = .048). Whereas 14% of older drivers who did not receive speed of processing training ceased driving,
only 9% of those who completed eight or more sessions of speed of processing training ceased driving.
Conclusion. Speed of processing training may delay driving cessation among older drivers with speed of processing
difficulty.

Task 3 + Task 4  800 ms) (15). Eligible SKILL participants
who performed poorly on the UFOV (n = 124) were randomly
assigned to either speed of processing training (n = 61) or a
control condition that involved the same amount of social
contact and computer contact (internet use, n = 63). One
participant did not complete at least eight sessions of speed
training.
The second study was Advanced Cognitive Training for In-
dependent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE), which recruited par-
ticipants with the same inclusion criteria as described
previously for SKILL with the exception that participants
were not required to show UFOV difficulties, and ACTIVE
specifically excluded individuals with functional disabilities
and life-threatening disease. In ACTIVE, older adults who re-
sided in the community were recruited through senior centers,
churches, senior housing, senior community organizations,
and health clinics. Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria
are detailed elsewhere (16). Similarities and differences
between the two studies are summarized in Table 1. ACTIVE
participants were randomly assigned to speed of processing,
memory, or reasoning training or to a no-contact control group.
To aggregate the data sets, a post hoc subsample of ACTIVE
participants from the speed of processing training and control
groups with baseline UFOV scores that met the SKILL inclu-
sion criteria were selected (n = 444). Of these 444 participants,
211 were randomly assigned to the control condition and 233
to speed of processing training. Seventeen of those random-
ized to training did not complete at least eight sessions.
The sample consisted of 568 adults ranging in age be-
tween 63 and 91 years and comprised 70% females and
76% Caucasians. These participants had a wide range of
education from sixth grade to PhD, with an average of some
college or vocational training.
To examine the impact of completing speed of processing
training upon subsequent driving cessation, we compared
those who attended eight or more training sessions (n = 276)
with those who completed no training sessions. This crite-
rion was chosen a priori in that attending at least 8 of 10
sessions was considered completing the training in both the
ACTIVE and the SKILL studies as well as prior training
studies (15­18). The number of participants by study and
condition as well as the number of training sessions com-
pleted are presented in Table 2.
Measures
Measures common to the two studies are listed subse-
quently and were administered with identical protocols in
both the SKILL and the ACTIVE studies.
The Mobility Driving Habits Questionnaire (19) was
used to ascertain driving status and the number of days per
week driven.
A standard letter chart was used to measure far visual
acuity. Scores were assigned from 0 to 90 based upon how
many letters were correctly discriminated (90 is equivalent
to a Snellen score of 20/16). The scores can be easily con-
verted to Log minimum angle resolvable but for convenience
are scaled so that higher numbers reflect better vision.
Mental status was assessed with the MMSE (20),
which is commonly used to screen for dementia. Scores
can range from 0 to 30, with higher scores representing
better cognition.

The UFOV measured speed of information processing
for tasks of visual attention across four increasingly difficult
subtests (21). Each subtest is scored as the display duration
(16­500 ms) at which the participant could perform the task
correctly 75% of the time.
Procedure
Speed of processing training was led by a trainer and in-
volved 10 sessions in which trainees practiced computer-
ized exercises of visual attention aimed at enhancing the
speed and accuracy of visual performance. In both studies,
the training sessions were 1 hour in duration and were com-
pleted twice a week for a period of 5 weeks (15). The cogni-
tive assessments, conducted by testers who were blind to
treatment condition, were repeated immediately posttrain-
ing, and the driving questionnaire was repeated 3 years after
training.
Analyses
The two study populations did not significantly differ at
baseline in age, cognition, or days driven per week (ps >
.05). However, the SKILL participants tended to have
poorer vision overall (p < .05). Thus, vision was included
as a covariate. Although older adults are likely to cease
driving due to poor vision (8,9), visual acuity would not be
expected to be significantly affected by training participa-
tion. Given that driving cessation rates did not differ by sex
or race (ps > .05), these variables were not further explored
in analyses.
Stratified Cox regression analyses were used to assess the
probability that an individual would cease driving across
the subsequent 3 years as a function of training participation
(completing eight or more sessions) while controlling for
baseline driving and vision, stratified by study. A different
baseline hazard is calculated for each study, and the overall
hazard function is obtained for each covariate in the model.
Time was right censored, calculated as the number of
months between baseline and the 3-year interview, for per-
sons who reported driving at the 3-year follow-up assess-
ment. For persons who did not remain drivers, the point at
which driving ceased in terms of months after baseline was
used to time the event.
Results
Multivariate analyses of variance were first conducted to
assure that the training and control groups did not differ at
baseline in age, cognition, vision, or number of days driven
per week. No significant group differences were found,
Wilks' L = .986, F(5,552) = 1.55, p = .173. Of the 294 par-
ticipants randomized to speed of processing training, the 18
who did not complete eight or more sessions did not differ
at baseline from the 276 who did in age, days driven
per week, cognition, or visual acuity, Wilks' L = .994,
F(5,288) < 1, p = .901.
Repeated measures analysis of variance confirmed a sig-
nificant group by time interaction for UFOV performance,
indicating the significant impact of training on speed of pro-
cessing, Wilks' L = .601, F(1,413) = 274.69, p < .001.
Stratified Cox regression analyses were used to examine
training participation as a predictor of driving cessation to-
gether with both baseline driving and visual acuity stratified
by study (ACTIVE vs SKILL). Results of the model are pre-
sented in Table 3 and Figures 1 and 2. Baseline driving (p <
.001) and vision (p = .007) were significant predictors of
subsequent driving cessation. Older drivers who initially
drove more often and those with better vision were less
likely to cease driving. Speed of processing training partici-
pation was protective against driving cessation (hazard ratio
[HR] = 0.596, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.356­0.995,
p = .048). Participants who completed speed of processing
training were 40% less likely to cease driving across the sub-
sequent 3 years as compared with controls (see Table 4).

COGNITIVE TRAINING AND DRIVING CESSATION 1265
Discussion
There is increasing evidence that cognitive and physical
(22) interventions can prolong driving mobility and safety
for older adults. In particular, cognitive speed of processing
training may improve driver safety on the road (13), prolong
driving mobility across 3 years (14), and reduce rates of
driving cessation by 40% among older adults at risk for mo-
bility decline. These results indicated that while 14% of the
control participants ceased driving, only 9% of those who
completed training (eight or more training sessions) ceased
driving over 3 years.
Although cognitive performance is emerging as a salient
predictor of cessation (i.e., 10,23), it is important to note
that social and demographic factors are also related to the
decision to stop driving (24). Although female gender has
been associated with higher risk of driving cessation in the
past (25), it was not associated with driving cessation in this
sample. In analyses that control for baseline driving, female
gender has not emerged as a risk factor for cessation in
modern cohorts of older drivers (i.e., 10,23). Thus, the
higher rates of cessation found among females in the past
may reflect a cohort effect.
To have adequate power to examine driving cessation as
an outcome with a sufficient sample size of speed of pro-
cessing trained individuals, it was necessary to combine
data across two different studies. We recognize that this
method of estimating the impact of training is not without
limitations. It is important to note that there were some
methodological differences between the ACTIVE and
SKILL studies. Most notably, SKILL used a control group
that involved both social contact and computer contact,
whereas the ACTIVE study involved a no-contact condi-
tion. However, the combination of these conditions is justi-
fied by prior research that found no differences between this
type of social contact and computer contact condition and a
no-contact control group when examining the impact of
speed of processing training (26). Another difference is that
the ACTIVE speed of processing training protocol involved
specified practice for the first five sessions and adaptive
training for the remaining sessions, whereas SKILL used
only adaptive sessions (e.g., exercise difficulty is tailored to
the individual). One would expect that these differences
would not inflate the training effect size but rather would
make it more difficult to detect training effects in that adap-
tive training is more effective than specified practice (15).
Another limitation is that the results presented are not
intent-to-treat analyses. When examining all participants
randomized to speed of processing training (n = 294) as
compared with controls, the impact of training was mar-
ginally significant, HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.39­1.06, p =
.083. Given that the noncompleting participants appear
similar to completing participants on baseline measures,
this suggests that at least eight or more sessions of the

training is required for reduction in driving cessation rates.
Ongoing analyses are examining the minimal dose of cog-
nitive training needed to significantly affect older adults'
driving. Future research is required to confirm these re-
sults in a single prospective study of older drivers at risk
for mobility problems.
Overall, research indicates that speed of processing
training may prolong safe driving mobility among older
adults at risk for mobility loss based on cognitive speed of
processing performance. Paired with prior research, these
results indicate that older drivers at risk for mobility prob-
lems can be identified with measures such as the UFOV
and Digit Symbol Substitution Tests (10) and referred to a
cognitive training program. Cognitive speed of processing
training may enhance on-road driving safety (13); protect
against declines in driving exposure (number of challeng-
ing conditions encountered while driving), driving space
(extent into environment driven), and increased driving
difficulty (14); and may delay driving cessation.
