Abstract
Objective: Older adults often appraise and remember events less negatively than younger adults. These tendencies may
influence reports that rely more on nonexperiential, reconstructive processes. As such, the current study examined whether
age differences may be more pronounced for reports of emotions that span across increasingly longer temporal epochs
compared to reports of more proximal emotional experiences.
Method: Participants (aged 25­74 during Burst 1) from the Midlife in the United States Survey and the National Study of
Daily Experiences reported the negative affect they experienced across a month, a week, and throughout the day at two
measurement bursts 10 years apart.
Results: Across all negative affect measures, older age was related to lower levels of negative affect. The effect of age,
however, varied across the three temporal epochs, such that age differences were smallest when people reported their daily
negative affect and greatest when they reported their monthly negative affect.
Discussion: Taking into account how emotion reports differ based on method provides a more realistic picture of emo-
tional experience in adulthood. Findings suggest that age differences in emotional experiences vary based on whether ques-
tions ask about short versus longer time periods. Age advantages are most pronounced when people recall emotions across
increasingly longer periods of time.
Keywords: Affect--Age differences--Aging--Appraisals--Emotion
The relatively high level of well-being observed among
older adults has often puzzled researchers. At a time in
life when many objective indicators of functioning such
as cognitive speed, memory performance, physical health,
and social prestige decline, many older adults nonethe-
less report higher levels of happiness and lower levels of
distress than people in their 20s (e.g., Stone, Schwartz,
Broderick, & Deaton, 2010). To understand this "paradox
of aging," researchers often turn to explanations regarding
how people appraise their lives. Emotional reports, such
as assessments of life satisfaction or contentment, include
an evaluative component (Rojas & Veenhoven, 2013).
Because older adults often appraise and remember emo-
tional stimuli less negatively than younger adults and
increasingly value emotion-related goals (see review by
Charles & Carstensen, 2013), these factors may partially
explain the age differences that researchers have found in
emotional well-being.
The model of strength and vulnerability integration
(SAVI) posits that age differences in emotional experiences
vary according to when an emotional experience is cap-
tured, with age differences least pronounced when people
are immediately exposed to stimuli and in response to events
that elicit high physiological arousal, and most pronounced
when they are asked to remember previous emotional expe-
riences over long time intervals (Charles, 2010). Memory for
emotional experience is a reconstructive process that is often
based on current goals and appraisals (e.g., Levine, Lench,
& Safer, 2009). Researchers have discussed the different fac-
tors that contribute to reports of more immediate emotional
experiences versus retrospective reports of emotional experi-
ence (Robinson & Clore, 2002); whereas reports of more
immediate experience are based on experiential and contex-
tual information, reports asking people to recall how they
were feeling in the past relies more on personal beliefs and
emotion-related goals.Thus, both the immediate demands of
an ongoing event and the reconstructive process used when
thinking about prior emotions are posited to influence when
age differences are most and least pronounced.
According to socioemotional selectivity theory, older
adults are motivated to focus on and remember more posi-
tive aspects of their environment (Carstensen, 2006). As a
result, they typically fail to display a "negativity bias" often
observed among younger adults, instead remembering
more positive and less negative stimuli than their younger
counterparts (e.g., Charles, Mather, & Carstensen, 2003;
see reviews by Reed & Carstensen, 2012; Reed, Chan, &
Mikels, 2014). In contrast, emotions experienced closer to
the time they occur may be less susceptible to reconstruc-
tive processes and instead rely on experiential and con-
textual cues (Robinson & Clore, 2002). To test whether
age differences are more pronounced for reports assessing
longer temporal epochs, the current study examines age dif-
ferences in reports of well-being that required recollection
across different temporal periods--that is, the same day,
the prior week, and the prior month.
Reappraisals, Memory, and Age
Older adults often interpret negative situations more posi-
tively and appraise their daily stressors as being less severe
than younger and middle-aged adults, despite there being
no objective differences in experimenter-rated severity
(Almeida & Horn, 2004). After watching videotapes that
captured them discussing a conflict with their spouse, for
example, older adults rated the contentious behaviors of
their spouse less negatively than objective observers (Story
et al., 2007). Older adults also interpret neutral stimuli
more positively than younger adults (van Reekum et al.,
2011), and are less likely to ruminate about previous events
compared to younger adults (Nolen-Hoeksema & Aldao,
2011).
Memory, like appraisal, is also less negative with age.
For example, after viewing positive, negative, and neutral
images, older adults recalled fewer negative relative to posi-
tive images than did younger adults (Charles et al., 2003).
Results from this study and others suggest that this pattern
follows a linear progression with age, such that older adults
show greater memory for positive versus negative stimuli
than middle-aged adults, and middle-aged adults show this
positivity bias more so than younger adults. In addition to
laboratory stimuli, autobiographical incidents are remem-
bered more positively among older adults than younger
adults (e.g., Comblain, D'Argembeau, & Van der Linden,
2005; Kennedy, Mather, & Carstensen, 2004).
Socioemotional selectivity theory posits that emo-
tional goals increase in importance with age, motivating
older adults to focus more on positive and less on nega-
tive aspects of emotional experiences (Carstensen, 2006;
Charles & Carstensen, 2013). Based on the premise that
emotional goals are chronically activated to a greater
degree with age, socioemotional selectivity theory has been
used to explain why older adults react more strongly to
positive than negative stimuli on a neurological level (e.g.,
Mather et al., 2004), attend to more positive and less neg-
ative information (Mather & Carstensen, 2005), appraise
information less negatively (Charles & Carstensen, 2008),
and remember information more positively than younger
adults (Reed & Carstensen, 2012). Consistent with this
view, older adults reliably report lower levels of negative
affect than do younger adults when asked about the emo-
tions they experience in general (e.g., Gross et al., 1997)
or across the previous month (e.g., Mroczek & Kolarz,
1998).
Emotions in the Moment
Older adults often report and remember experiences less
negatively and more positively than younger adults (e.g.,
Stone et al., 2010). These findings, however, contrast
with many laboratory studies examining age differences
in immediate emotional reactions to negative stimuli.
For example, film clips of loss elicit greater levels of sad-
ness among older adults compared with younger adults
(Kunzmann & Gruhn, 2005; Seider, Shiota, Whalen, &
Levenson, 2011; Tsai, Levenson, & Carstensen, 2000),
and film clips depicting scenes of justice elicit stronger
emotional responses among older adults (Charles, 2005).
In addition, older and younger adults report similarly
intense emotions when asked to relive previous negative
experiences (Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, & Ekman,
1991) and when asked to watch a short video clip elic-
iting disgust (Scheibe & Blanchard-Fields, 2009). These
age differences in reactions are consistent with reports of
current emotional experience in more naturalistic settings:
For example, although older adults report less frequent
negative experiences, they report similar levels of inten-
sity when these emotions are experienced in their daily
lives (Carstensen, Pasupathi, Mayr, & Nesselroade, 2000;
Carstensen et al., 2011).

The Current Study
Discrepant findings in the aging and emotion literature
may be due--at least in part--to the temporal nature of
the emotion assessed (Charles, 2010). The current study
examines age-graded trends in daily and longer-term retro-
spective reports of affective well-being. Using a large sam-
ple of adults, who ranged from 25 to 74 years-old at the
first wave of data collection (i.e., Burst 1), we were able
to examine age differences in emotional experience across
a large segment of adulthood. By simultaneously examin-
ing two bursts of data collection (Burst 1 and then another
burst 10 years apart) in one multi-level model, it is possible
to examine this effect over time, as well as more clearly
elucidate patterns of cross-sectional age differences and
age-related changes. Examining both the cross-sectional
and longitudinal differences simultaneously in the model
offers a more parsimonious and innovative design than the
use of separate models to test each effect. We predict that
age-graded benefits in affective well-being are larger for
self-reports that rely on more distant retrospection (across
a month) compared to retrospection across a shorter
time span (across a week), and even more so than for
self-reports of relatively proximal emotional states (end-
of-day). We test this hypothesis regarding age differences
using the cross-sectional analyses because they capture a
wide age range to detect these effects. Because we based our
hypothesis on developmental theory, we test the hypothesis
longitudinally as well. Although we only can examine this
hypothesis across 10 years, any trends in the correct direc-
tion would strengthen the argument that these differences
reflect a developmental change and not cohort or period
effects.
Method
Participants
Between 1994 and 1995, over 7,000 adults (25­74 years-
old) completed the Midlife Development in the United
States (MIDUS) Survey, consisting of a telephone interview
and mailed survey assessing multiple dimensions of psy-
chosocial, physical, and financial well-being (Brim, Ryff, &
Kessler, 2004). After returning the surveys, 1,787 respond-
ents were contacted to participate in the National Study
of Daily Experiences (NSDE), and 1,483 (562 women,
469 men; response rate = 83%) agreed to participate. The
NSDE included short telephone interviews across eight
consecutive evenings and a longer final interview on the last
day asking about their prior week. Data collection spanned
an entire year. NSDE participants were more likely to be
female (54%), averaged 47.3 years of age (SD = 13.2), with
the majority having at least a high school degree or the
equivalent (66%). They were predominantly Caucasian
(90%), with a small subsample of African Americans
(6%); and the rest from other racial groups or declined to
state their ethnicity. MIDUS 1 and NSDE 1 were repeated
approximately 10 years later (MIDUS 2 and NSDE 2). Of
the original 1,483 respondents, 793 again participated in
both MIDUS and NSDE (retention rate = 53.4%). Reasons
for nonparticipation included refusal (53%), loss of con-
tact (30%), deceased (13%), and no longer eligible (4%).
New respondents (n = 1229) increased the sample size to
2,022 (including 180 African Americans to compensate for
low minority representation). NSDE 2 respondents aver-
aged 56 years-old (35­84 years-old) and 57% (n = 1,154)
were women. This second time point included 14,912 of
the 16,176 possible daily telephone interviews (92%). For
the current study, all people who participated in at least one
burst of the study were included. All participants in NSDE
I (n = 1,483) and the additional new participants at NSDE
2 (n = 1,229), were included in analyses examining differ-
ences between their reports of daily, weekly, and monthly
negative affect. To investigate longitudinal change across
burst measurements, we included negative affect measures
from the second burst of data collection for those people
who participated at both times (n = 793).
Measures
Emotional experience
Data from both MIDUS 1 and 2 and NSDE 1 and 2 were
included in the analyses. Daily diary NSDE data were col-
lected, on average, 6 months after the MIDUS survey was
returned. Given the interest in examining the same ques-
tions across different temporal epochs, only measures that
included identical items at all three time points at both data
collection bursts were included in these analyses. Below we
describe the negative affect measure (each comprised of
one averaged score across six different negative emotions
or emotion states) for the three varying temporal epochs
(for the day, the prior week, and the prior month).
Daily affect
Negative affect was assessed in NSDE I using the Non-
Specific Psychological Distress Scale, which has been vali-
dated in diverse populations (Kessler et al., 2002). This
scale includes the average of six emotions or emotion
descriptors, including worthless, hopeless, nervous, restless,
or fidgety, that everything was an effort, and so sad that
nothing could cheer you up. Participants rated the extent
to which they experienced each emotion that day using a
5-point scale ranging from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of
the time). Additional positive and negative emotions were
added during NSDE 2, but for consistency, only the six
emotions assessed during NSDE 1 were examined in the
current study.
Weekly affect
At the end of the week after participants had reported their
daily experiences (including daily negative affect), they
were asked to reflect upon the past week and to endorse
how much of the time that week they experienced each of
800 Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 5
the six emotions described previously, with these emotions
averaged to form one score ( =.79­.80).
Monthly affect
Monthly average negative affect was calculated by asking
respondents in the MIDUS questionnaires how much of the
time during the past 30 days they experienced the same
six emotions or emotional descriptors mentioned above (
=.85­.87).
Analytic Strategy
Multivariate multilevel models were employed to appropri-
ately represent the nested structure of the current data (i.e.,
bursts nested within persons) using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS,
Cary, NC). We were specifically interested in comparing
the magnitude of age effects on each of the three NA vari-
ables, which required an extension of the traditional multi-
level model to a multivariate framework (Mehta & Neale,
2005; Snijders & Bosker, 1999). The nesting structure for
this model appears in Figure 1. Person represents the high-
est level in this model. Bursts are then nested within each
individual and the NA variables are nested within each
burst. More conventional approaches would require fitting
three separate MLMs for each negative affect variable (i.e.,
daily, weekly, and monthly) for each measurement burst.
The multivariate approach allowed us to explicitly model
the inter-correlations of the NA variables both within a
burst as well as across bursts and persons. Additionally,
by examining all three variables for both bursts simultane-
ously, we provided the strictest test of our hypotheses while
limiting Type I error. This model enabled us to simultane-
ously examine age differences in each of the NA measures,
as well as compute a statistical test comparing age differ-
ences across the temporal windows. Using this method also
allowed the explicit estimation of the between-person and
within-person covariation among the three different meas-
ures of NA. The NA variables were modeled as a function
of age at baseline, the amount of change from Burst 1 to
Burst 2 (operationalized by a dichotomous variable to cap-
ture change in overall levels of affect within an individual
across bursts) as well as changes in each of the three nega-
tive affect variables as a function of burst by means of the
following interactions: daily × burst, weekly × burst, and
monthly × burst), and the age at baseline by burst interac-
tion. Random effects were included at the person and burst
levels which allowed a unique intercept for every person at
each burst. Individuals identifying as Caucasian and those
with at least a high school degree tended to be older (ps<
.0018) and women tended to have significantly higher rat-
ings of monthly NA (t(2469) = 5.25, p < .001). The main
effects of these variables and their interactions with time
were included as well as covariates (gender, education, and
ethnicity) in the model.
Results
Results are presented in Table 1. There was significant vari-
ation in the intercepts across bursts as well as individuals.
We estimated the within- and between-person correlations
among the three measures of NA, which appear at the bot-
tom of Table 1. At the within-person level, daily reports of
NA and weekly reports of NA were strongly and signifi-
cantly correlated. Monthly reports were significantly corre-
lated with daily and weekly reporting windows though not
as strongly. At the between-person level, all three measures
of NA (daily, weekly, and monthly negative affect) were
strongly and significantly correlated.
Cross-Sectional Findings: Age and Negative
Affect Across theTemporal Epochs
Older age was related to less NA for each of the three meas-
urement reports,but the size of this effect varied across types
of measurement. Using focused contrasts, we computed age
differences in each NA variable using 1 SD below the mean
to represent younger adults (~34 years old) and 1 SD above
the mean to represent older adults (~60 years old). We then
compared the magnitude of the age difference in each of
the NA reporting intervals. The hypothesized age differ-
ences, whereby older adults had lower NA scores than rela-
tively younger adults, were significantly greater in monthly
reports than both daily (Estimate = .0042, SE = .001, p <
.0001) and weekly reports (Estimate = .0024, SE = .001,
p = .0039). Age differences in weekly reports were sig-
nificantly greater than age differences in daily reports
(Estimate = .0018, SE = .0004, p < .0001).
Longitudinal Findings: Age and Negative Affect
Across theTemporal Epochs
We had hypothesized that age differences showing lower
NA scores with age would be reflected in decreased NA
over time, but there was no main effect of time over the
Figure 1. The model used to simultaneously estimate levels of negative affect.

10-year interval at the average age. However, this was
qualified by a time by age at baseline interaction for the
daily reports of NA. Findings indicated that the relatively
younger adults in this sample--those in their mid-30s and
younger--showed greater decreases in daily reports of NA
over time than those who were older at baseline.
Covariates: Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal
Findings
To ensure that age differences were not confounded by
education level and to test that any observed age dif-
ferences were not qualified by gender or ethnicity, we
included these variables as covariates in the models.
When examining education level, gender and ethnicity,
there were significant effects of education on daily and
monthly reports of NA; individuals with lower educa-
tion reported higher levels of NA compared to those with
higher education. Additionally, individuals with higher
levels of education showed significant decreases in daily
reports of NA over time. Compared with women, men
reported significantly lower NA on monthly reports and
Caucasians reported significantly lower monthly NA
compared with non-Caucasians. Neither gender nor eth-
nicity interacted with time, and age differences were simi-
lar across people varying according to ethnicity, gender,
and education level.
Discussion
The current study examined how emotional experiences
vary by age among a large sample of adults. Similar to
findings converging from a growing body of research, older
age was related to significantly lower levels of negative
affect in all analyses. The strength of these age differences,
however, varied according to the temporal epoch captured
by each measure. As hypothesized, age differences in emo-
tional well-being were more pronounced for emotional
assessments of increasingly longer temporal epochs, such
that age-graded benefits were larger for monthly assess-
ments than weekly assessments, which, in turn, were larger
than daily assessments.
This pattern helps to reconcile some inconsistent find-
ings from previous literature. Cross-sectional studies of
global negative affect reports, such as how people feel "in
general" or during the past 30 days, consistently show age-
related decreases across middle-age and into adulthood
(e.g., Kobau, Safran, Zack, Moriarty, & Chapman, 2004;
Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998; Schieman, 1999). In laboratory
settings, however, findings vary.When exposed to emotional
stimuli or recalling upsetting experiences, older adults'
reports of negative affect are sometimes lower (e.g., Charles
& Carstensen, 2008), sometimes higher (e.g., Charles,
2005; Kunzmann & Gruhn, 2005), and other times simi-
lar to those of younger adults (e.g., Levenson et al., 1991).

and the more consistent findings for global assessments
suggests that age differences for more immediate, reactive
experiences are less robust than responses that rely on more
retrospective reports of emotional experience.
Explaining theTemporal Recall Pattern
SAVI posits that when remembering an event or consider-
ing how they feel "in general," people often reappraise the
situation less negatively, a strategy older adults use more
frequently and arguably more effectively than younger
adults (Charles, 2010). Closer to the time of the negative
experience, age differences in emotional experience should
not be apparent and may even reverse in direction. Yet,
we found age-related reductions in reports of negative
affect across all temporal frames in the current study. At
first glimpse, this result runs counter to SAVI's prediction.
One reason may lie in how we assessed the most proxi-
mal measure. Daily--not momentary--affect was assessed.
The emotion-eliciting event could have happened up to
24
hr prior to when daily NA was assessed, so it is likely
that age-related differences in appraisals may have already
occurred.
In a study examining momentary assessments, par-
ticipants reported their current affective state and experi-
ence of stressors throughout the day (Scott, Sliwinski, &
Blanchard-Fields, 2013). Immediately following stressor
exposure, older adults reported less of an increase in NA
than did younger adults. After adjusting for levels of global
perceived stress, the age differences in immediate reports of
NA disappeared, however, indicating that ongoing, stress-
ful situations may have hindered older adults' ability to
cope with an acute stressor. Thus, only when older adults
perceived their life as less stressful were age differences
observed. Moreover, the age advantage did not extend
to stressor severity--all adults were just as affected by
increases in stressor severity (Scott et al., 2013).
Another study showed that age was related to lower
levels of NA when people reported experiencing a num-
ber of stressors across their week (stressor pile-up), but
not in their reactivity to more immediate daily stressors
(Schilling & Diehl, 2014). The authors concluded that emo-
tion regulation skills may have helped older adults distance
themselves from previous stressors, but were unable to be
employed for more immediate stressors. Similarly, another
study found that when older adults are preoccupied by a
hassle--and therefore unable to effectively engage in emo-
tion regulation strategies--they experience higher levels
of deactivating (e.g., sadness, disappointment) negative
emotions than younger adults (Wrzus, Luong, Wagner, &
Riediger, 2014).
Importance ofThis Finding to Current Literature
and Future Directions
These findings have potential implications for the field.
First, the majority of cross-sectional studies examining age
and emotion find that older age is related to lower levels of
negative affect. The majority of studies also examine more
global levels of well-being. Understanding that age differ-
ences vary based on how and when these questions are
asked may help to provide a more realistic picture of age
differences in emotional experience. Older adults may have
less negative reappraisals over time, but their experiences
for more proximal reports may be more similar to younger
adults than what may be construed from prior knowledge.
These findings may also have implications for study-
ing the interrelationships among aging, emotional expe-
rience, and health outcomes in the future. A small but

growing body of research suggests that these different
measures of affective experience are related to different
outcomes. For example, several studies find that momen-
tary assessments of emotional experience predict physical
health outcomes more strongly than global measures of
emotional experience, and more retrospective reports are
more strongly related to decision-making (see review by
Conner & Barrett, 2012). Moreover, research indicates
that these associations may vary according to age. One
study, for example, found that although self-reported
emotion (a measure of anger expression) was not asso-
ciated with health outcomes for younger adults, it was
associated with metabolic syndrome among the older
adults in the sample (Boylan & Ryff, 2015). It is unclear
at this time whether associations between other aspects
of emotional experience with cognitive and health-related
processes are invariant with age. Understanding whether
age differences exist in different types of emotion reports
is another step towards understanding how the health-
emotion associations may vary, or not, across different
age groups. Future studies examining how health-related
outcomes relate to emotions that are assessed the moment
they are experienced, versus how emotions are recalled
using more global reports, will inform our knowledge of
how these related but different constructs are associated
with health-related outcomes, and how these associations
vary with age.
Longitudinal Versus Cross-Sectional Findings
The longitudinal findings did not reflect the cross-sectional
findings. Average levels of weekly and monthly negative
affect were not significantly different across the 10-year
period. For daily NA, however, the youngest adults in the
sample--those in their 20s, 30s and early 40s--showed
decreases across time, but the oldest half of the sam-
ple--those in their fifties and older, showed no significant
change during the same time period. The current findings
vary from a prior study that examined a slightly older age
range (45­97) and found a decrease in overall levels of NA
(asking participants about their experiences over the previ-
ous month) when assessed over a 10-year period for peo-
ple under the age of 70, but an increase for people over
the age of 70 (Griffin, Mroczek, & Spiro, 2006). These
findings are consistent, however, with two other longitu-
dinal studies asking about negative affect in slightly differ-
ent ways. In one longitudinal study, age-related decreases
across 20 years were larger for younger and middle-aged
adults than older adults. For people who started the study
in their early 60s, decreases in negative affect were very
small--about an estimated half-point across twenty years,
or about .25 of a point across 10 years (Charles, Reynolds,
& Gatz, 2001). In another longitudinal study of daily emo-
tional experience across 10 years, age-related increases in
daily positive emotional experience (a combination of posi-
tive and negative emotion reports) was evident only among
those under 64 years-old (Carstensen et al., 2011). People
who began the study at age 64 or older remained stable in
their emotional experience. In the current study, age dif-
ferences in reported daily negative affect did decrease over
time among the younger participants in the current sample
but not the older participants.
Possible reasons for decreases in daily negative affect in
younger and middle-adulthood, but not older adulthood,
could be that people are gaining experience in emotion
regulation strategies during this earlier period of life. When
they reach older ages, however, they have a higher prob-
ability or experiencing challenges to their emotional well-
being, such as a chronic physical health conditions that
may limit functional abilities, financial stressors resulting
from decreased income after retirement, or loss of people
who provide them with a sense of belonging. Another pos-
sibility is that negative affect levels may reach a floor effect,
given that most people report low levels of negative affect.
A life without the experience of negative affect, whether
this negative affect stems from compassion over the sor-
rows of others, the signal of a health condition that needs
attention, or information necessary to correct an inequality
or mistreatment, may not only be unfeasible, but also mala-
daptive for a healthy lifestyle. Finally, the terminal decline
of life is related to decreases in well-being constructs (e.g.,
Infurna et al., 2014), so we would not expect negative affect
to continue to decrease during this dying process.
The lack of longitudinal findings in the weekly and
monthly reports may indicate that this phenomenon is
a cohort effect, such that people develop schemas about
emotions early in life that are primed when they are asked
about emotions across longer periods of time. Using this
explanation, people born earlier in the 20th century were
presumably taught different appraisal processes that shape
their emotional experiences compared to those taught to
the people in successively later-born cohorts. When asking
people to reconstruct emotional experience for longer tem-
poral periods (asking about affect across a week or month),
people use their beliefs about emotions and other seman-
tic knowledge when recalling this experience than they do
for more immediate or more temporal (daily) emotional
experiences (e.g., Robinson & Clore, 2002). Social desir-
ability may also play a role for cohort effects, such that
older adults may feel greater pressure to respond in socially
desirable ways that may be more primed when people are
asked about emotions experienced over longer periods of
time (e.g., Soubelet & Salthouse, 2011). Another possibility
is that changes do occur, but these changes are small (e.g.,
Pinquart, 2001) and take more than a decade to become
significantly different. Previous cross-sectional analyses, for
example, examined differences observed across people rep-
resenting a 50-year range, not one of 10 years (see review
by Charles & Carstensen, 2013).
In addition, historical effects may be at work. At
the time of the second data collection, the United States
shared in the global economic crisis, the wars in Iraq and
804 Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 5
Afghanistan were underway, and terrorism became a pub-
lic concern. Given that the first burst of data collection
occurred during a time of economic prosperity, well-funded
and large retirement portfolios, and little concern about the
nation's vulnerability to terrorism, the stability in reports of
negative affect may partly be due to the major sociopoliti-
cal changes that have reshaped our nation.
Limitations and Conclusion
The current study included a predominantly Caucasian sam-
ple from the United States. If cohort and historical effects
played a role in these findings, examining adults from other
cultures and ethnicities may reveal very different profiles.
In addition, longitudinal analyses based on two time points
offer less reliability than studies including more time points,
and prevents examinations of nonlinear effects. In addition,
negative affect was defined with questions that focused on
symptoms of depression and anxiety, and more expansive
measures that included additional emotional experiences
(e.g., anger, positive emotions), would offer a more expan-
sive understanding of the emotional lives of adults, and
how they vary depending on the temporal epoch examined.
Moreover, the weekly and daily questions were collected
during the same time period, but monthly recall was col-
lected, on average, 6 months earlier. It is unclear how the
overlap, or lack thereof, may influence the findings. Asking
people about their emotional experiences every night may
influence their weekly recall, and this additional memory
aid may serve to minimize age differences in weekly affec-
tive reports. As a result, findings may be stronger if the daily
and weekly reports were not assessed in the same week.
Finally, the most stringent test of SAVI would be to com-
pare emotional experiences across age groups immediately
following an emotion-eliciting event and during subsequent
recollections of the event (e.g., same day, after 1 week, after
1 month). SAVI emphasizes the importance of physiological
arousal, so a measure of emotional intensity near the time
of an emotion-eliciting event would a more stringent test
of our predictions. In the current study, participants were
asked about the frequency of their emotions, not the inten-
sity, during the previous 24
hr (often completed the inter-
view at night asking about the events of the day), which, as
stated previously, likely resulted in reconstructive processes
occurring, thereby decreasing the likelihood that we would
find support for SAVI. Yet, even with these limitations, age
differences in daily recall of negative emotions were smaller
than recall of weekly emotions which, in turn, were smaller
than recall of monthly negative emotions. Still, further, more
stringent tests of SAVI are warranted, with affect measured
immediately following the event and emotions regarding the
event assessed at increasingly longer time frames. Despite
these limitations, however, the current study is one of the
first to offer insight into how different types of affect assess-
ments yield altered patterns of age differences. By holding
the type of emotion consistent across the temporal epoch
and by studying these questions within the same individual,
problems that arise as a function of sampling biases or dif-
ferent emotions asked were eliminated.
The current study revealed that age is related to lower lev-
els of negative affect, but that this effect is more pronounced
for increasingly longer temporal epochs. Assessing emotions
across different intervals, then, yield different portrayals of
the degree to which older adults report less negative affect
than younger adults. Given that different temporal assess-
ments are hypothesized to share different associations with
cognitive and health-related outcomes, these findings high-
light the need to think carefully before selecting a measure of
well-being, and to be cognizant of the fact that some types
of emotional experience are more influenced by age-related
factors than others. Researchers and clinicians alike may
therefore need to be aware of these differences when asking
people about their emotional experiences.
