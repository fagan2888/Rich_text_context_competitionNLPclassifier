Introduction
The basic structures of societies are the same as every society
has sociopolitical and economic systems as well as educa-
tional institutions. But the performances of these institutions
and the development of nations vary according to the socio-
political dynamics of every society. In other words, every
case is different because what works in one society may not
be effective in another one. Therefore, the transformation of
multi-religious and multi-lingual Nigeria and its seemingly
chaotic sociopolitical and economic environment require a
leader with the skills and knowledge to address the systemic
bottlenecks that hinder national development. That will
involve changing the structure and "human consciousness"
(Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013, p. 240) as well as the "mental
models" (Senge, 2006, p. 163) of the political leaders from
their engrained "ego-system awareness" into "eco-system
reality" (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013, p. 11).
Although the process seems daunting because of the disor-
dered Nigerian environment, it is not by any means impossible to
accomplish with collective mindfulness (Scharmer & Kaufer,
2013) as every Nigerian is a stakeholder in the affairs of the
nation. However, Germer, Siegel, and Fulton (2005) have defined
"mindfulness," among other things, as a "moment-by-moment
awareness" (p. 6). For Bodhi (2000), mindfulness means having
awareness, attention, and remembering. However, to the already
crowded definition, Davis and Hayes (2011) have added that
"mindfulness is a moment-to-moment awareness of one's expe-
rience without judgment" (p. 198). Yet others have noted that
"mindful leaders" are "courageous," they perceive the "big pic-
ture" and "create environments of trust and safety," which
would "ignite innovation" (Moore, 2012, pp. 1-2).
The differing perspectives on the issue of poverty are not
new. It was also underscored by various speakers at the 2014
Africa Innovation Summit Cabo Verde that no country has
overcome the challenges of poverty reduction, and no region
will overcome the challenges of development, without prov-
ing its ability to be creative and innovative.And Nigeria is not
an exception. Nigeria's leaders appear to have a "fixed mind-
set" (Dweck, 2007). The nation is choking on its democratic

"Why Nations Fail" to Develop: The Case
of Nigeria
Victor E. Dike1
Abstract
This article focuses on the forces that prevent nations from developing politically, socially, and economically or why some
of them have failed to achieve their purpose. It draws profusely from two inspiring books: Why Nations Fail and Leading From
the Emerging Future to explore as to whether or not the political leaders of Nigeria can learn any lesson from the seminal
work. The books concentrate on practical approaches that empower political leaders to shift their mind-sets to enable them
to transform their extant extractive political and economic institutions that hinder national development. Unlike previous
studies on leadership and development in Nigeria, which have observed that the system has been rendered unproductive by
poor leadership, this article argues that the problem with Nigeria is that the political leaders have failed to shift their engrained
mind-sets from "ego-system awareness to eco-system reality" to enable them to build and maintain effective institutions and
infrastructure that drive the economy and develop the nations. It also argues that discussion about the leaders' mind-set and
national development deserves a different approach to transform the nation's ossified institutions into innovative and creative
ones. This will encourage the leaders to collectively shift their mental models to design and implement growth policies that
will fit into the 21st-century economy and empower them to lead from the emerging future.

experiment because the leaders do not operate on principles
that ally with democracy. Worse still, the system is colored
by unbridled corruption, non-functional health care and edu-
cation systems, and institutions and infrastructure that are
antithetical to capacity development. These forces have
resulted in a weak economy, rising youth unemployment,
and poverty as well as insecurity in the society. The leaders
do not seem to understand that empowering the people will
change the future of the society. It has been noted that no
society can separate poverty from the political and economic
forces in the society as well as the mind-set of the leaders
because they determine the state of human condition in every
nation.
But what is mind-set? According to Webster's New
Collegiate dictionary (1980), mind-set is "a mental inclina-
tion, . . . a . . . state of mind" (p. 725). For the Oxford
Advanced Learner's Dictionary (2015), mind-set "is a set of
attitudes or fixed ideas that someone has and that are often
difficult to change" (para. 1). Meanwhile, for Dweck (2007),
professor of psychology at Stanford, mind-set is a set of atti-
tudes, or "mindsets are just beliefs . . . powerful beliefs . . .
something in your mind . . ." (2007, p. 16) that need not be so
set. For the author, everyone has either a fixed mind-set or a
growth mind-set that can be changed. A fixed mind-set is one
in which you view your talents and abilities as well fixed or
that your "qualities are carved in stone." You are who you
are, your intelligence and talents are fixed, and your fate is to
go through life avoiding challenge and failure (Dweck,
2007). But a growth mind-set, however, is one in which an
individual sees his or her mind-set as fluid, a work in prog-
ress; that means that our fate is one of growth and opportu-
nity. Furthermore, according to Dweck (2007), mind-sets are
not set or "carved in stone" (p. 6) because at any time, any
person can learn to use a growth mind-set to achieve success
and happiness and that a change of mind is always possible
(Dweck, 2007). That is what good leaders (as well as their
followers) need for their nations to develop and thrive and
for their citizens to reach their full potential. Given the back-
ground, a person's mind-set directs his or her action. That,
according to Dweck (2007), means that "The view you
adopts for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your
life. It can determine whether you become the person you
want to be and whether you accomplish the things you value"
(p. 6).
If this writer may ask, are the mind-sets of Nigeria's lead-
ers "carved in stone?" Why is Nigeria difficult to change?
Why has Nigeria failed to develop with abundant human and
material resources at its disposal? Why has prosperity eluded
the nation? Why are many Nigerians swimming in the deep
ocean of poverty? Put differently, why is there a rising unem-
ployment rate in the society? There are conflicting reports on
the rate of unemployment in Nigeria because of paucity of
data. Available pertinent information shows that Nigeria's
unemployment rate is about 24% (this is a very conservative
figure). However, youth unemployment rate is put at more
than 50%, which represents about 64 million people ("Rate
of Job Creation Insufficient to Tame Unemployment in
Nigeria," 2014). But for the new Oxford Poverty and Human
Development Initiative (OPHI), Nigeria's poverty rate is
hovering around 43.3% of the estimated population of 170
million (see Emejo, 2014).
It is proper to note that three groups of unemployed youths
have been identified in this article: university graduates, high
school graduates not yet enrolled in any university program,
and those who did not complete high school education.
Others who have added to the rising rate of unemployment
include people who choose to leave their current job to retire,
those who went back to school to acquire new skills and
knowledge for another career, and those who take a position
at another organization. It is, however, proper to note that
most of the unemployed youths are vulnerable to antisocial
activities as they are struggling to make ends meet without
any form of government assistance.
Given the above background, the political leaders do not
seem to be taking responsibility for these problems as every-
one is blaming everyone else. Nigeria's leaders, it appears,
hate to be held accountable for anything. It is also proper to
note that the root cause of the present social, political, and
economic predicaments in the society is not the making of
the leaders alone, but collective selfishness. Everybody in
Nigeria, it seems, wants to be in a leadership position whether
or not they have the skills and knowledge to stimulate a
healthy competition, increase the wealth of the nation, and
thus, create economic opportunity for everyone. Leadership
is not about revenue sharing but about moving people to
action to create wealth. These actions are possible with lead-
ers who are committed to improving the living conditions of
the people.
The challenges facing Nigeria appear to be deep-rooted in
the mind-sets of the leaders and the nation's extractive politi-
cal and economic institutions (Acemoglu & Robinson,
2012). As a result, there is a serious disconnect between ego-
system thinking and eco-system reality (Scharmer & Kaufer,
2013). It has aptly been noted that the state of our mind-sets
or mental models (Senge, 2006) affect what we do--our per-
formance, decision-making process, and how we manage
ourselves. For Nigeria to move forward socially, politically,
and economically, the leaders and followers (in collective
leadership) should have a deeper shift in their mind-sets and
gravitate toward "eco-system awareness" from their
engrained "ego-system thinking" (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013,
p. 11).
According to Albert Einstein's famous dictum, we cannot
solve our present problems with the same level of mind-set
or consciousness that created them. Meanwhile, because of
the failure of the political leaders of Nigeria to change their
mindset and embrace creative and innovative ideas that will
transform and restructure the system, Nigeria's non-func-
tional education and health care systems will continue to
threaten the growth and development of the economy as
Dike 3
these are the engines that drive individual and national produc-
tivity. But "failure is not an option" (Blankstein, 2010, p. 1) for
Nigeria. However, what Nigeria will become is the society
the leaders and followers have decided to create. Without a
doubt, majority of the people wants a leader who can lead
from the emerging future possibilities.
Purpose
This article revisits the issues of leadership and development
in Nigeria as it attempts to investigate as to whether or not
the leaders have any lessons to learn from Why Nations Fail
and Leading From the Emerging Future. The books, as noted
earlier, deal on practical approach to helping leaders shift
their mind-sets from their ego-system awareness to eco-sys-
tem reality and create inclusive political and economic insti-
tutions to empower the citizens to reach their full potential.
This article, therefore, seeks to discuss some of the pertinent
issues raised in the books as they relate to leadership and
development problems facing Nigeria.
Research Method
This article will attempt to provide an in-depth assessment of
the forces that are preventing Nigeria from developing as it
should with the abundant human and material resources at its
disposal. As noted, information for this article was derived
mainly from Why Nations Fail and Leading From the
Emerging Future. Information is also gathered from the
research and descriptive analysis of other scholars, analysts,
and practitioners as well as recent newspaper and journal
articles that are pertinent to the issues in discourse. Thus, the
primary method of study was an extensive review of avail-
able related literature for an extensive and in-depth descrip-
tion and analysis of leadership and development problems in
Nigeria and their implications in the society. The sources of
the information were thoroughly evaluated and analyzed to
determine their authenticity.
Problem Statement
Debates about why Nigeria has failed to develop as it should
with abundant human and material resources at its disposal
have been raging for decades. Some have noted that the
problem is due to the absence of effective leadership. Yet
others have observed that Nigeria is stuck in its present
sociopolitical and economic predicaments because the lead-
ers have been unable to change their mental models (Senge,
2006), which has prevented them from building critical insti-
tutions and infrastructure capable of transforming the society
into the 21st-century system. Yet the political leaders who
apparently have "fixed mind-set" appear to think that Nigeria
can be transformed into an industrialized society without
changing their mentality, reframing their meaning of
leadership, building functional institutions, and designing and
implementing pro-growth policies. The political leaders of
the developed countries could not have transformed their
economies into the healthy and productive state they are
today without shifting their mentality that enabled them to
lead from the emerging future.
Research Questions
This article focuses on the following questions:
Research Question 1: Do most leaders of Nigeria pos-
sess fixed or flexible mind-set?
Research Question 2: What will it take for the political
leaders to change their mind-sets from "ego-system
awareness" to "eco-system reality?"
Research Question 3: Why has Nigeria failed to develop
as it should with the abundant human and material
resources at its disposal?
Research Question 4: Can Nigeria become an industrial-
ized nation without inclusive political and economic
institutions?
Designing a New Strategy
Leaders of developed nations are known to have continually
shown their knack in managing difficult situations by craft-
ing functional strategies that align with the culture of the
society or organization they lead. When a society, a person,
or an organization has a problem, the first instinct will be to
find a solution(s) to the problems (Kahane, 2005). A well-
designed strategy is a symbol of action that will enable the
authorities to achieve the desired goal--whether it is chang-
ing the behavior of a people or engineering a social change.
A strategy is a "game plan" to achieve one or more goals. It
is a plan, a "how" and "a means of getting from here to there"
(Mintzberg, 1994, p. 23). A ". . . strategy is a solution to
move from where you are now to where you want to be"
(Bucknell, 2011, para. 3).
As mentioned earlier, Nigeria is facing myriad social,
political, and economic problems. Yet the leaders do not
appear to have the skills and knowledge to design and imple-
ment effective strategies to resolve the issues. For instance,
they are unable to tackle the infrastructural and institutional
problems, improve the nation's standard of education, and
rebuild the economy. The nation's system of education and
that of the economy must align to make a difference in the
life of the people. The political leaders should flip the lens
around a little to work out ways to serve the public good.
They should collectively "develop cross-sector platforms of
innovation and leadership" (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013,
p. 205) for positive change in the country.
It has been noted that Nigeria's leadership quality is in its
DNA. For instance, the fundamental causes of Nigeria's
weak economy are poor leadership and governance that have
contributed immensely to non-functional infrastructure and
4 SAGE Open
institutions, low quality of education, and lack of practical
skills and knowledge to drive the economy. There is no dis-
cernable change of attitude on the part of the leaders to
address the shortfalls in the system; they are not willing to put
their egos aside and listen to the people. They are mired in
what has been branded "ego-system awareness" (Scharmer &
Kaufer, 2013). The political leaders appear to worry about the
realities in the eco-system only when there are serious national
issues that threaten their own well-being such as the Ebola
crisis (Freeman, 2014, para. 1) described as "an epidemic
without mercy" (see "Briefing Lightbox," 2014, p. 11).
At this critical juncture, Nigeria needs a leader who is
committed to leading the society to a bright and bold future.
This is because political stability in any country comes with
the development of the institutions and infrastructure that
drive the economy, create employment, and take care of the
people's needs. Nigeria has abundant natural and human
resources that will enable the people to tackle their family
and community obligations, only if the leaders can change
their "mental models" (Senge, 2006, pp. 163-190) and move
from their ego-system awareness to eco-system reality
(Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013). Without the political leaders
reframing their thinking model and their meaning of leader-
ship, without fixing the infrastructure and institutions that
drive the economy, without transforming the education sys-
tem into the 21st-century model and equipping the students
with the knowledge and skills to compete effectively in the
knowledge-driven global economy (Banks, 2008), and with-
out taking care of the needs of the growing number of the
people in poor health, the society will remain unproductive
and underdeveloped.
"Reframing Leadership" in Nigeria
Debates about the seemingly absence of effective leadership
in Nigeria have been endless. For instance, Achebe (1983)
has observed that "the problem with Nigeria is the failure of
leadership" (p. 1). Others have noted that there is poor lead-
ership in Nigeria because most of the leaders are mired in a
sense of entitlement in their actions, beliefs, and attitudes
(Akor, 2014; Ani, 2014; Oluokun, 2014). The people would
like their myriad social, political, and economic problems
resolved by their political leaders. Specifically, they would
like to have an enabling environment and a healthy economy,
peace and stability in government, good roads, and func-
tional hospitals and schools. Also, they would like their
human and civil rights respected. The leaders talk about
these issues without resolving them; instead, they lock them-
selves up in their lofty offices dishing out orders that are
unimplemented. But the people may not get the services they
want without the leaders reframing their meaning of leader-
ship (Bolman & Gallos, 2011).
True leaders have passion and understanding for those
they lead. And they are known to resolve conflicts by refram-
ing the situation, which means "looking at the situation with
a new set of eyes." When the leader reframes, it will enable
him or her to respond to the situations by commanding con-
trol with confidence. As noted, leadership is not in the posi-
tion, it is taking responsibility and accountability, and it is
working for the good of society to enable the people to
achieve their full potential (The Integral Business Leadership
Group, 2013). Instead of providing services, the political
leaders use government policies to buy support from the
people.
Personal growth is a component part of leadership. Thus,
the leaders must change their mind-set to lead from the
emerging future possibilities (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013). As
Peter F. Drucker has noted, "You cannot manage other peo-
ple [or a society] unless you manage yourself first" (cited in
The Integral Business Leadership Group, 2013, para. 1). In
Leadership, Burns (1978) has noted two types of leaders: (a)
transformative and (b) transactional. Transformative leaders
are those who have a vision to mobilize people to action,
while transactional leaderships are addicted to quid pro
quo--"If you scratch my back, I will scratch yours" (see
Banks, 2008, p. 94). This style of leadership seems pervasive
in Nigeria. Yet, another type is leadership that hands down
orders from top to bottom. This style of leadership is mostly
adopted by leaders who want utmost control over the deci-
sion-making process in an organization (Kouzes & Posner,
1995). Also, most of the leaders of Nigeria appear to fall
within this category; the society has powerful leaders with-
out effective institutions to tame their actions (The Integral
Business Leadership Group, 2013).
Many people in Nigeria wish to be leaders, but very few
of them seem to understand the essence of leadership. True
leadership is about serving the people; it is about having a
sense of responsibility; it is about providing the people the
service they need, or "getting things done through people"
(Northouse, 2007, p. 3). In addition, leadership is about
inspiring others to excel. In a democratic society, power is
said to come from the people at the grassroots. In making
decisions the leaders must be cognizant of the opinions and
needs of the people. And the leader will assume responsibil-
ity for what went well and what went wrong because true
leadership is about taking responsibility wherever responsi-
bility needs taking. Put differently by Scharmer and Kaufer
(2013), "The essence of leadership has always been about
sensing and actualizing the future" (p. 110).
In productive and progressive societies, creativity is alive
in everything they do. There is inspiration and aspiration
involved in education as talented faculty is hired and stu-
dents radiate creativity in innovations and research. All these
are made possible by the political leaders who invest national
resources in technological development and innovation.
Educational institutions offer students high-quality educa-
tion that leads to good career pathway. This is not the case in
Nigeria where political leaders are filling their pockets with
public money, instead of serving the people. To move for-
ward, Nigeria's leaders must change their mind-sets and the
Dike 5
people must not allow them to continue "patching prob-
lems," instead of "redesigning" the system to make it func-
tion effectively. The leaders should also learn to become
better listeners and empower the people with the skills and
knowledge they need to become more productive. In addi-
tion, they should be "grounded in mindfulness and service"
(Maqueda, 2014, para. 1) to enable them design and execute
effective policies, and offer solutions to the nation's myriad
social, political, and economic problems. That means refram-
ing leadership and the environment.
Reinventing the Environment
Nigeria's existing democratic structures are not yet effective.
Its extractive political and economic institutions do not cre-
ate incentive for the citizens to save, invest, and innovate.
Power and wealth are concentrated in the hands of those con-
trolling state apparatus. In other words, only those in control
of or connected to those in political power are benefitting
from the system. Lack of effective law and order and eco-
nomic incentive has destroyed the environment. As human
beings, our actions, attitudes, and beliefs are defined by our
"physical environments" (Dewey, 1934, p. 345). As such, we
cannot remain in a dysfunctional environment and expect
good outcomes in what we do. As our "physical life" is
affected by the "physical environment" (Dewey, 1934,
p. 345), so also our nation's environment will affect the qual-
ity of attention the people will give to their actions. The sys-
tem is corruption-charged, and that has affected the "moral
life" (Dewey, 1934, p. 345) of the people and the health of
the economy. "No permanent solution is possible save in a
radical social alteration" (Dewey, 1934, p. 343).
The political leaders can only change the system by
changing their mental models (Senge, 2006). They are
always on each other's throat with their petty politics ("What
Seems a Petty Dispute," 2014, p. 31), instead of dealing with
broad national issues and creating an environment that would
accommodate the interests of the diverse population. For
instance, the former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, is always
critical of the policies of President Goodluck Jonathan (see
Obasanjo, 2013), instead of working collaboratively with his
administration to build a stable and brighter future for the
society. Also, instead of designing and implementing effec-
tive monetary policies to build a healthy economy, the for-
mer governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mallam Sanusi
Lamido Sanusi, who is now the Emir of Kano, took delight
in heating up the polity when he alleged that the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) failed to remit
about US$49.8 billion to government's coffer (see Leba,
2013).
The long-running misunderstanding between the Federal
Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities
(ASUU)--a union of university academic professors founded
in 1978 (Akinnaso, 2013)--disrupted the academic calendar
of higher institutions for months. In addition, the relentless
drop in global oil prices is putting enormous economic pres-
sures on the government that lacks any solution to the prob-
lem. Worse still, the Boko Haram (a militant Islamic group)
onslaught (see Adetayo, 2014; Carson, 2015) in the northeast
is threatening to destabilize the country. Do the political
elites want political reform or revolution?
Everyone seems to agree with the general observation that
corruption and economic mismanagement (Ross, 2014),
which has scared away both domestic and foreign investors
from the economy, is a major part of the problem. As of
today, the state does not seem to have the capacity to stop
the terrorists creating chaos. The terrorists do not seem to
be selecting a particular group of people to kill; they are
indiscriminately killing people. The leaders do not seem to
have any solution to this presently as they are pointing
accusing fingers at everyone else. It is feared that this can
precipitate into a state failure. The energy wasted on all
these sociopolitical plots could have been channeled toward
reinventing the education system to open the nation "up to
the highest future possibilities" (Scharmer & Kaufer 2013,
p. 29).
Radical Transformation of the Education System
As observed earlier, Nigeria is facing major challenges,
including the crisis in the education system and corruption
scandals that are strewn around the political landscape like
straw hut in a hurricane (Ross, 2014). In particular, the edu-
cation system lacks proper funding and planning (Afolayan,
2014), and teaching and learning are based on theory with
little or no practical application of what the students learned
in the classroom. Practical application is the way for any
society to become innovative and creative, and thus produce
results the people want (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013). It has
been observed that the ultimate goal of teaching is to ensure
that students develop a deep understanding of the subject
matter and interconnected knowledge and skills they can
draw upon when needed (Banks, 2008).
The problem facing the nation's education system and
other facets of the polity is dictated by the political and eco-
nomic institutions that do not shift toward progressive,
destructive innovation and thus economic success. In a nut
shell, this means that destructive innovation (or creative
innovation) will replace obsolete technologies with new and
emerging technologies as well as create better ways of think-
ing, leading, and doing things. Nigeria's repressive political
and economic institutions have contributed immensely to the
eventual socioeconomic decay or stagnation (Acemoglu &
Robinson, 2012). To transform the education system, the
leaders'policies must shift toward promoting favorable insti-
tutions, creativity, and progressive innovation (Acemoglu &
Robinson, 2012). And the teachers and administrators in the
education sector should be motivated to acquire the knowl-
edge and skills needed to introduce practical education that
works (Banks, 2008).
6 SAGE Open
Scholars have observed that nations will rise when they
design and implement pro-growth political institutions that
share power (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012), train, educate,
and produce productive workers. But they fail when the
institutions fail to adapt to the environment or when the pow-
erful political elites benefiting from the status quo prevent
the institutions from being effective. So, to move forward,
the leaders should create progressive institutions and adopt
methods that have been tested by successful countries and
adapt them to fit into Nigeria's environment. Although some
educators and policymakers think that investing in technol-
ogy will improve the education standards and student perfor-
mance, others have different opinion. For instance, Daniel
Goleman in his inspiring new book, The Triple Focus: A New
Approach to Education, co-authored with Peter Senge, thinks
that the combination of instructions in "social and emotional
learning" can enable students to better understand them-
selves, their friends, and their environment. Such instruc-
tional techniques can improve both social skills and academic
performance (Goleman & Senge, 2014).
Thus, improving Nigeria's education system should go
beyond rhetoric. Blaming the teachers is not the answer to
the failing standard of education in Nigeria. The extractive
political and economic institutions (Acemoglu & Robinson,
2012) in which the teachers work are the problems. As long
as the underlying institutional problems are not resolved, all
the rhetoric will not fix the education system. Nigeria should
build inclusive political and economic institutions to
empower the teachers and treat them as professionals they
really are. In addition, they should adopt effective teaching
and learning as well as education reform that will add value
to the system. This seems possible only through building
mindful schools and training mindful educators--those who
have the welfare of students at heart, and are committed and
motivated to making teaching and learning enjoyable. It has
been observed that mindfulness is an antidote to the diseases
of the 21st-century life (Cullen, 2011).
Perhaps because of poor investment in human capital
development (education and health care system), Nigeria's
secondary school (high school) graduates the educational
institutions churn out yearly are ill-prepared to face the rig-
ors of university education. To reverse this ugly trend, lead-
ers of the secondary school education sub-sector should
develop progressive policies and educate the educators so
that they can empower their students with the knowledge
and skills to become effective participants in 21st-century
society (Banks, 2008). Lack of proper attention in preparing
high school graduates for university education seems to
pose serious problems for the development of creative,
innovative, and productive citizens. For the workers to com-
pete effectively in the 21st global economy (Scharmer &
Kaufer, 2013), the education system should be transformed
to meet 21st-century standards by equipping workers with
the 21st-century knowledge and skills (Trilling & Fadel,
2009).
This writer avers that if teachers are well trained, it will
lead to motivation of teachers as well as improve teaching
and learning strategy in the classroom. It is, therefore, neces-
sary for Nigeria to adopt innovative and imaginative ways to
train and support teachers to enable them to deliver quality
teaching and better motivate students. It is equally essential
for teachers and administrators to understand their philoso-
phy of teaching, which is their business, as that will be essen-
tial for them to understand themselves and their colleagues
better, as this may engender high individual performance and
team work.
To restructure the education system, Nigeria needs lead-
ers "who are transformative in orientation" (Banks, 2008, p.
94). For Burns (1978), transformative leaders have a vision
to organize and mobilize other people to action. Without
retooling the education system and arming the workers with
appropriate skills and knowledge and without abolishing
policies and politics that are inimical to economic develop-
ment and prosperity, Nigeria cannot be transformed into a
productive society. Developed and progressive countries
became what they are today because their people fought and
overthrew the powerful political elites who dominated politi-
cal power, and thus create a society where political rights
were properly shared and the government was responsive to
the needs of the people (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012).
As noted earlier, to improve the education system, the
educators should first be educated and motivated to empower
their students, because the quality of faculty and teachers
matter (Kezar & Maxey, 2014) in the quality of teaching and
support they provide the students. The education leaders are
good at blaming the teachers and students for the poor per-
formance in external examinations such as West African
Examinations Council (WAEC) and National Examinations
Council (NECO) without taking responsibility for their own
contribution to their poor performance. Quality counts; the
leaders should develop an education system that serves the
society well. Thus, they should upgrade the status of the edu-
cators and respect them like other professionals; they should
empower them to make better decisions (Banks, 2008) and
effectively perform their duties. "A teacher's skill makes a
difference in student performance" both "in school and their
feelings of well-being" (Saphier, Haley-Speca, & Gower,
2008, p. v).
Extractive institutions hamper national development.
Thus, without inclusive institutions, sustainable growth and
development is difficult, if not impossible (Acemoglu &
Robinson, 2012). It is unreasonable to expect the disre-
spected teachers to educate and motivate the youth; the soci-
ety should expect to get only what it has invested in the
education system.As John Dewey (1859-1952) has observed,
". . . we receive but what we give . . ." (Dewey, 1934, p. 214).
When teachers feel honored, they will develop the will and
capability to educate their students and equip them with the
skills, knowledge and attitudes to "become change agents [in
the] society" (Banks, 2008, p. 97). The bottom line is that the
Dike 7
society should reform the institutions and discard the educa-
tion policies that do not work because the state of the educa-
tion system will affect the conditions of the whole system,
including the health care system.
Transforming the Health Care System
As noted above, inclusive institutions matter in national
development. According to Acemoglu and Robinson (2012),
"institutions that encourage prosperity create positive feed-
back . . . that prevent efforts by [greedy and selfish political]
elites to undermine them" (p. x). Like in the education sys-
tem, Nigeria's health care system does not appear to meet the
needs of the people. Poorly equipped hospitals and health
clinics are strewn all over Nigeria (Dantiye, 2015; see "The
Health Workers Strike," 2014). And like the educational
institutions, the health care institutions are lacking the emerg-
ing 21st-century medical science and technologies that
would enable the health care workers to provide high-quality
health services to the people (Adejoro, 2015; Musawa,
2014).
However, due to ineffective institutions, the health care
providers cannot provide good quality services without
proper training and resources. Worse still, they operate in
unsafe work environments (Dantiye, 2015). Thus, transfor-
mation of the health care system should "revolve around
transforming the relationship between patients and the
healthcare providers" (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013, p. 209).
That means changing the political attitude of the elites as
well as creating pro-growth health care strategies and institu-
tions. There are many communities without basic health care
facilities; as a result, the people do not have access to pri-
mary health care services (Adejoro, 2015, para. 20).
Consequently, thousands of Nigerians die every year from
preventable diseases such as high blood pressure, hyperten-
sion, prostate cancer, diabetes, breast cancer, maternal child
birth issues, and malnutrition (Musawa, 2014).
Unfortunately, because of poor institutions and deteriora-
tion of the health care system, the political leaders (and oth-
ers who can afford it) often travel abroad to receive
high-quality health care services at the expense of the public
(Adejoro, 2015; Dantiye, 2015). The ordinary citizens often
resort to private assistance to resolve their basic health prob-
lems (see "The Health Workers Strike," 2014). To produce a
healthy and productive workforce for the 21st-century econ-
omy and to build a stable society, the leaders should rethink
the ways they manage the nation's health care institutions.
The ineffective political institutions are inimical to eco-
nomic growth. Medical doctors and other health care work-
ers are often on strike to press home their demands over
diverse issues, including non-payment of salaries and allow-
ances, which often lead to unnecessary loss of lives (see
Atoyebi, 2014). Some people think that the health care pro-
fessionals care only about their remuneration than provision
of health services to the needy (see News Agency of Nigeria
[NAN], 2014). As a result, many Nigerians have lost faith in
the health care system as they perceive the health care work-
ers as unreliable, unskilled, undereducated, and not kind-
hearted care providers (Dantiye, 2015). Everyone should
have access to high-quality health care that is being now
enjoyed only by the rich political leaders. The administrators
of the health care system, in collaboration with the medical
community, should transform and modernize the health care
system for the benefit of everyone. Building functional
health care facilities in every community to deliver high-
quality health services to the citizens and building a healthy
economy is imperative. But this requires an effective institu-
tion and a transformative leader who will work collectively
with others in the society.
Building a Healthy Economy
Building a healthy economy does not occur overnight. It
takes planning, resources, and unswerving leadership to
build and sustain a healthy economy. The first step is for the
leaders of Nigeria to develop a growth mind-set and shift the
nation's educational paradigm to educate and train the tech-
nical manpower to drive the economy. Ineffective political
and economic institutions are known to bread a weak econ-
omy, which creates high unemployment and poverty and
generates sociopolitical uncertainty (Scharmer & Kaufer,
2013). Yet the political leaders do not seem to take the threat
to national stability seriously as they are mired in their self-
ish political interest. As emphasized in Leading From the
Emerging Future, "In order to meet the challenges of our
time, we need to shift our thinking as individuals and as a
society" because "Today's economy works as a set of locally
embedded and globally interlinked eco-systems" (Scharmer
& Kaufer, 2013, p. 67).
Nigeria's economy is not an exception. Many Nigerians
appear to have entrepreneurial skills; they are very creative
and innovative. But the unpredictable and unconducive,
extractive political institutions and unfriendly business envi-
ronment have stunted their zeal. In particular, poor leader-
ship that has combined with all these conditions to create
weak economy has not allowed the society to tackle its sys-
temic problems. Starting a small business from scratch is
challenging. It takes a lot of passion and determination to
keep your business running and to market your products or
services under the poor business environment in Nigeria.
Thus, the situation does not allow for creativity and innova-
tion (Schumpeter, 1942). To build a healthy economy, the
political leaders must shift their mind-sets and invest in the
infrastructure and institutions that drive the economy and
enhance individual and national productivity. Also, the soci-
ety must empower the youth with the skills and knowledge to
take initiatives, conduct independent inquiry, compete effec-
tively in the global economy, and produce results the society
wants (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013).As Senge (2006) has aptly
noted, "When . . . people develop [effective institutions and
8 SAGE Open
work collaboratively] . . . they can be a formidable force for
change" in the society (p. 370).
In reality, the secret of economic growth, since the time of
Adam Smith, is specialization. But this is possible with
effective political and economic institutions to enable Nigeria
train the needed technical manpower to specialize in produc-
ing the goods and services the world wants. This goes to say
that economic growth and investment in human capital
development are inseparable as they complement each other
(Ocampo & Vallejo, 2012). As noted above, why Nigeria has
failed to develop and why the people are poor is because the
political and economic institutions are extractive (Acemoglu
& Robinson, 2012). Put differently, the leaders extract mate-
rial and financial resources (revenue) from the system with-
out investing in the institutions and infrastructure that drive
the economy.
The mood in Nigeria does not appear upbeat because the
people are not politically empowered as the society is eco-
nomically underdeveloped. Although Nigeria has a history
of democratic elections, it does not seem to have an inclusive
political institution. This is because during elections, there is
violence and intimidation and electoral fraud. And the sys-
tem does not have a political level playing field; the rich and
powerful individuals control the system. In some cases,
chaos would reign, colored by kidnapping and political mur-
ders. Those who can afford it would hire private security per-
sonnel for protection. Nigeria cannot build a healthy economy
and lead from the emerging future without the leaders shift-
ing from their engrained "ego-system to eco-system aware-
ness both individually and collectively" (Scharmer & Kaufer,
2013, p. 243). Without that, the society will remain chaotic
and underdeveloped with untold human misery.
Why Has Nigeria Failed to Develop?
History is replete with reasons nations have failed to achieve
their purpose. Some scholars blame lack of effective political
and economic institutions to manage the affairs of the society
(Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012). Others blame poor leader-
ship (Achebe, 1983). In particular, Nigeria has failed to
develop as it should because of poor leadership and extrac-
tive political and economic institutions that have concen-
trated political and economic power (or the wealth of the
nation) in the hands of the corrupt politicians who are con-
trolling the state machinery. The selfish politicians have per-
petually pauperized the citizens because they have refused or
failed to provide them basic public services, such as good
roads, quality education, and constant supply of electricity.
This is not to mention lack of good drinking water and basic
health care. Everyone knows that water sustains life and
unhealthy individual is an unproductive worker.
Lack of water and functional health care undermine the
health, safety, and productivity of the people in Nigeria. In
addition, Nigeria has failed to develop because the nation's
democracy and the type of policies that come out of it have
not been designed to benefit the ordinary people. Instead, the
policies benefit only the political lords and their cronies,
leaving the masses to make ends meet on whatever they
could find. Thus, politics in Nigeria has not created a level
playing field--it has not given the people a voice in govern-
ment. And this has opened the society up for constant social
unrest. Consequently, like in every other developing country
or sub-Saharan Africa, the people are not motivated to save
and invest in the economy (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012).
Related to the politics and democracy is the issue of func-
tional constitution. The political situation in Nigeria has not
really improved since the reprise of civilian government in
1999 (after the long years of military rule). For one, the so-
called civilian government is still using the constitution
crafted by the military and foisted on the people. This docu-
ment lacks true democratic principles; it has limitations on
the use of political power as well as the distribution of power
in the society, and vests absolute power on the corrupt politi-
cal leaders. With that, the political leaders can arbitrarily
cancel or shift scheduled elections without any person
blinking.
The 2015 national elections (presidential and national
assembly elections) in Nigeria were conducted as resched-
uled, and the elections and transition of power from the
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)­led government to All
Progressives Congress (APC) went relatively peaceful.
Although a new political leader, Muhammadu Buhari, has
been sworn in, the APC-led government does not appear to
be fully operational yet and the Boko Haram (the militant
Islamic group) onslaught in the society has not abated. In
other words, the group is still bombing facilities, killing
Nigerians, and disrupting economic activities in their strong-
holds in north-eastern part of the country. The question
remains: Is Muhammadu Buhari the messiah Nigerians have
been waiting for? This, in the author's opinion, is doubtful as
he does not seem to possess the political skills and knowl-
edge to work with the national assembly and tackle the prob-
lems facing the nation. Despite his campaign promises to
tackle insecurity, corruption, and youth unemployment in the
country, these challenges remain. The people want action,
not campaign rhetoric.
However, the basic political structure created by the mili-
tary remains and the mentality of the political leaders has not
changed. The political leaders took over power from the
military simply to continue with the absolute power structure
it inherited from the military, or recreated a system worse
than the one it inherited from the military. Under this condi-
tion it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the ordinary
person on the street to acquire political power to change the
way the system works. Thus, without a true political trans-
formation, the poor in the society will not even meet their
basic needs, not to mention challenging the system. For
Nigeria to develop as it should, the diverse ethnic, linguistic,
and religious groups in the society must honestly come
together to achieve a common purpose--that is to create a
Dike 9
positive sociopolitical change for the benefit of every group.
Without this, the livelihood of the millions of ordinary
Nigerians who are stuck in abject poverty will not change
and Nigeria will remain underdeveloped.
It is equally pertinent to emphasize that Nigeria has failed
to develop as it should because of its skewed value system
and social structure. Social structure, according to social sci-
ence literature, is the way a society is composed or orga-
nized, including the "social web of relations that regulate
human interaction" (Ferriss, 2006). The social structure and
values of a society determine its economic system and wealth
distribution patterns, the effectiveness of its legal system and
people's quality of life (Ferriss, 2006). Also, the social and
economic conditions determine the people's attitude toward
public resources and their social values. Thus, values are
conceptions that guide the way individuals act and react to
issues, evaluate people and events, and explain their actions
(Rohan, 2000; Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz, 1992). In addition,
social values determine what people believe in (good or bad).
However, values vary according to groups (religion, tribes,
and ethnic groups). A person's (or an organization's) values
define its "structure and purpose" and enable the individual
or organization to determine what is important and meaning-
ful. Some people, however, believe that social structure
develops naturally, while others think it is socially created by
the elites who seek to control the economic system or institu-
tional structure of a society (Hoff, 2003).
Social and leadership values could either spur or retard
the pace of national development. Thus, some cultures are
more suitable than others for economic growth and develop-
ment. Decades ago, Max Weber (1864-1920) talked about
the Protestant Work Ethic and the forces that led to the emer-
gence of capitalism and competition. Because of their work
ethics, individuals in the Western world are believed to have
become rich through hard work and invention, innovation,
creativity, and high productivity. The economic success of
the Asian Tigers have been attributed to their Confucian
Ethic or Value, which lays emphasis on hard work, loyalty
and respect for authority, and of course, punctuality to work.
Whether a society will develop or not depends largely on the
effectiveness of its institutions and infrastructure. Nigeria
cannot develop without advanced technological capability
(Kim, 1997; Mohan, 2003; Robbins, 2000) to spur innova-
tion and increase individual and national productivity (Lewis,
2004). This is to say that inclusive institutions will lead to the
emergence of new technologies. Technological development
is the engine that drives economic development (Sen, 1975)
as it engenders creativity and innovation (Schumpeter, 1942),
and thus economic growth and development.
As noted above, there is a large population and resources
in Nigeria to be extracted because many of the village dwell-
ers lack the political power to demand their rights and revolt
against the extractive institutions (Acemoglu & Robinson,
2012) that are benefiting only those in the corridors of power
and their cronies. This is among the major causes of Nigeria's
underdevelopment and the endemic corruption that leads to
moral laxity and lack of law and order. It is common knowl-
edge that Nigeria lacks effective institutions, structures, pro-
cedures to tame corruption. Today, any person in Nigeria
could "become fabulously wealthy" (Acemoglu & Robinson,
2012, p. 394) and famous without any discernible source of
income and nobody blinks (see "Before our politicians empty
the treasury," 2010). Public servants do not show up for work
on time and do not take their work seriously, and they expect
to get paid every month without being productive. The men-
tality that hard work and honesty does not pay (or is not
properly rewarded) has found its way into the school system
as students do not take their studies seriously any longer. The
"I don't care attitude" and the mentality to get rich through
fraud often discourage the spirit of competition and hard
work, and thus, inhibit national development.
Nigeria lacks inclusive political and economic institutions
(Acemoglu, 2003; Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012; Edison,
2003) to ensure proper rights and to empower the people
with the skills and knowledge to realize their full potential.
The political leaders have created these extractive institu-
tions to enrich themselves and their cronies leaving the
majority of the people to struggle for survival (Acemoglu &
Robinson, 2012). This is one of the reasons for the incessant
social unrests in the society, which have combined with the
turbulent global economy and financial crisis to undermine
the people's ability to earn a living and improve their liveli-
hood (World Economic Forum, 2007).
Many factors are retarding development and prosperity in
Nigeria. There is widespread social injustice in Nigeria; the
government rhetorically talks about the welfare of the needy
and the growing number of jobless and sick people. But it
does not provide them the tools to make a decent living;
majority of them survive by virtue of the traditional safety
net--the extended family system.As mentioned earlier, there
are conflicting statistics about the rate of unemployment in
Nigeria: The Nigerian Labour Congress at some point esti-
mated the unemployment rate to be 35% while the National
Bureau of Statistics report showed that about 10 million
Nigerians (about 20% of the entire labor force) were unem-
ployed as of March 2009. Recently, the World Bank reported
that more than 40 million Nigerians are unemployed (see
"Before Our Politicians Empty the Treasury," 2010). The
unemployment figure, as pointed out above, has worsened,
particularly among the youth. How can a nation develop and
prosper when the majority of the people are unemployed and
swimming in the deep ocean of poverty?
Nigeria's social structure and skewed value system appear
to have contributed to the failure of the many reforms agenda
and visions in the society. In particular, the Vision 2020 and
the re-branding campaign embarked upon some years ago,
which gulped a huge sum (but had nothing to show for it),
could have been invested on human capital and infrastruc-
tural development to spur the economy and create employ-
ment. No society has become an industrialized nation without
10 SAGE Open
investment in human capital development, functional institu-
tion and infrastructure, and particularly technology educa-
tion. The Asian Tigers could not have become what they are
today without investment in technological development
(Mohan, 2003). Any person who thinks that Nigeria can be
transformed into an economic giant or power-house without
technological capability must be living in a different planet.
Concluding Remarks
This article seems, in the opinion of this author, to be a con-
clusive overview of Leading From the Emerging Future and
Why Nations Fail as they relate to why Nigeria has failed to
develop. Although additional study is needed, after reviewing
the change framework in these seminal books and the activi-
ties of political leaders, this writer can hazard to say that
Nigeria's leaders can learn a huge lesson from this impressive
research on how to develop the society. This is because the
political leaders who are trumpeting positive social change
appear to have "fixed mind-set," which has prevented them
from adopting and implementing effective sociopolitical and
economic policies to transform the society. For instance, the
political leaders are unable to shift their fixed mind-set
(Dweck, 2007), to dismantle the nation's man-made extrac-
tive political and economic institutions (Acemoglu &
Robinson, 2012) that are inimical to Nigeria's economic
growth and development. Effective institutions and infra-
structure are known as the foundation for a long-run eco-
nomic growth (Hoff, 2003; Mohan, 2003; Robbins, 2000).
That is the crux of the matter with Nigeria. If the leaders
cannot change their mentality (Senge, 2006) or if they have
"fixed mind-set" (Dweck, 2007), how would they create
effective institutions and social structure to give the people a
voice in the political process? And how can they alter the
quality of attention the people give to their own actions? As
the behavioral dimension of change espoused by the reviewed
seminal research has noted, "The quality of results produced
by any system depends on the quality of awareness from
which people in the system operate" (Scharmer & Kaufer,
2013, p. 18).
Conflicts over the sharing of resources have been perva-
sive in the society. Given the poor state of affairs in the soci-
ety, the political leaders do not appear to be leading with
integrity. Most of them are not keeping their promises. Thus,
Nigeria's poor development appears to be caused by the poor
policies of the policymakers and ineffective institutions.
However, to move forward, the politicians should shift their
mental models (Senge, 2006), create inclusive institutions
(Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012), and develop the courage,
political will, and commitment to enthrone positive change
in the society. They should also give the people a voice in the
political process. The political leaders of Nigeria should,
therefore, create a unity of purpose and shared vision to
move the nation forward. The quality of a government, and
thus that of its leadership, determines the quality of its
policies and how they enhance the quality of the lives of the
citizens.
The books have played a significant role in shaping this
author's understanding of how to transform extractive politi-
cal and economic institutions into inclusive ones to empower
the people and engender creativity, innovation, and national
development. Currently, the education and health care deliv-
ery systems are not working, and the people are tired and
hungry because the health of the economy is weak. The polit-
ical leaders are able to stuff their pockets with public money
because the plethora of anticorruption measures instituted in
the society is not working. Many of them are not designed to
work; in fact, nothing works!
To prevent the rising discontent in the society from reach-
ing a boiling point, Nigeria needs a political leader with an
open mind, an open heart, and an open will (Scharmer, 2007,
p. 142; Senge, Scharmer, Jaworski, & Flowers, 2005) to
transform the education and health care systems and invest in
functionalinfrastructureandinclusiveinstitutions(Acemoglu
& Robinson, 2012). All these will combine to empower the
people and enhance individual and national productivity,
without which the nation will remain perpetually underde-
veloped, with its attendant social unrest and political insta-
bility. That, unfortunately, is the case with Nigeria.
