Abstract One in five U.S. residents under the age of 18 has at least one foreign-born
parent. Given the large proportion of immigrants with very low levels of schooling, the
strength of the intergenerational transmission of education between immigrant parent
and child has important repercussions for the future of social stratification in the United
States. We find that the educational transmission process between parent and child is
much weaker in immigrant families than in native families and, among immigrants,
differs significantly across national origins. We demonstrate how this variation causes a
substantial overestimation of the importance of parental education in immigrant fam-
ilies in studies that use aggregate data. We also show that the common practice of
"controlling" for family human capital using parental years of schooling is
problematic when comparing families from different origin countries and espe-
cially when comparing native and immigrant families. We link these findings to
analytical and empirical distinctions between group- and individual-level pro-
cesses in intergenerational transmission.

of age. Although the distribution of immigrants in terms of human capital is bimodal, it
is especially the large group of immigrants with little formal education that raises
concerns about the impact of immigration on social inequality. With the children of
immigrants currently composing more than 20 % of the U.S. population under age 18,
the extent to which this population will inherit the educational characteristics of their
parents is significant for the immediate and long-term future of ethnic stratification in
the United States.
Although the strength of intergenerational educational transmission is well docu-
mented for the general U.S. population (Blau and Duncan 1967; Mare 1981), until
recently, transmission within immigrant families was difficult to assess because of a
lack of representative, large-scale data identifying the educational attainments of
immigrants and their adult children. Instead, researchers relied on aggregate data, using
national origin or self-reported ethnicity to link generations by regressing the average
years of educational attainment of the children of immigrants on the average years of
educational attainment of immigrants of the same origins in previous survey years
(Borjas 1993, 2006; Card 2005; Card et al. 2000; Park and Myers 2010; Smith 2003).
Even as individual-level data on immigrants and their children became available, the
majority of the literature on second-generation attainment has focused on differences in
attainment controlling for parental background rather than examining the relationship
between parental and child educational attainment itself (for research from the past five
years, for instance, see Feliciano 2012; Greenman 2013; Haller et al. 2011; Harris et al.
2008; Kasinitz et al. 2008; Keller and Tillman 2008; Thomas 2009; Waters et al. 2010;
Xie and Greenman 2011).
This article provides a first methodological demonstration of potential biases emerg-
ing from both of these common approaches to the study of educational inequality
among the immigrant second generation. A recent review of European research by
Heath et al. (2008) suggests that the status transmission processes may differ across
immigrant origin groups, and Alba et al. (2011) also pointed to the fact that educational
attainment of immigrants of different origins are unlikely to be comparable. However,
neither these scholars nor the studies they reviewed have systematically evaluated the
potential for bias when the educational attainments of different immigrant groups are
treated as commensurate. We expand on these initial warnings, outlining in detail how
both of these methods rely on the assumption that educational transmission is uniform
between immigrants of different origins and, when natives are compared, between
immigrant and native families as well.
We demonstrate that this assumption is not upheld in the U.S. case. The resulting
bias in estimates of intergenerational transmission and expected years of education is
severe. Using the educational attainment of parent­child dyads, we find the regression
coefficient of children's on parents' years of education is, on average, 0.11 but ranges
from close to 0 in some groups to as high as 0.37. This implies a generally weak
relationship between parental and child educational attainment within immigrant fam-
ilies.1 In contrast, when aggregating the very same data and using weighted averages of
national origin groups, as has been done in prior research, we find much higher
estimates: an association between foreign-born parents' and their children's education
1 This has also been shown using individual-level data in Denmark (Nielsen et al. 2003), Sweden
(Hammarstedt and Palme 2006), and Germany (Dustmann 2008; Gang and Zimmermann 2000).

of 0.43. We also show that when parental education enters a model as a control
variable, models that assume a homogeneous relationship between parental and child
education distort national origin comparisons.
We connect these findings to research that suggests significant variation in the link
between parental education and the larger set of variables that shape the educational
attainment of children: between immigrants and natives on the one hand, and across
immigrants from different national origins on the other. We also establish two correlates
of the strength of educational transmission: parent­child links are stronger in groups
with higher average education, and links are weaker in groups with higher within-group
variation. In our conclusions, we discuss the relationship between these correlates and
current understandings of national origin variation in second-generation attainment.
Variation in Intergenerational Transmission
Sociologists studying migration have long been interested in intergenerational change
among immigrants, writing extensively on the earlier "great wave" of migration at the
turn of the century (Gordon 1964; Park 1930; Warner and Srole 1945). These early
theories conceived of assimilation as a group-level process, predicting a sequence of
improving group relations with the disappearance of ethnic groups as its endpoint. Even
Gordon's influential treatise on the subject is framed as a corrective to the lack of
"research and theoretical attention to the nature and implications of American commu-
nal group life" (1964:5 emphasis added).
These approaches were extraordinarily productive, guiding immigration research for
the better part of a century, yet they do not clearly delineate between individual- and
group-level processes. Assimilation is seen as a convergence of immigrant groups
toward the "core" and the disappearance of prejudice and discrimination. At the same
time, it encompasses processes that are clearly individual in nature, such as intermar-
riage, shifts in participation, and identification.
It is an achievement of recent revisions of assimilation theory (Alba and Nee 2003;
Portes and Rumbaut 2001) to clearly delineate these two constitutive aspects of
intergenerational change. On the one hand, Alba and Nee developed an analytical
model that distinguished individual-level socioeconomic mobility, intermarriage, and
residential assimilation (boundary crossing) from collective changes in the salience of
ethnicity for immigrant groups as a whole (boundary blurring or shifting). On the other
hand, segmented assimilation scholars (Haller et al. 2011; Portes and Rumbaut 2001;
Zhou et al. 2008) have distinguished individual- and group-level processes and dem-
onstrated how opportunities for socioeconomic advancement for immigrant families are
contingent on the characteristics and opportunities available to their ethnic group as a
whole: the context of reception. For immigrant groups on the upper end of the
bifurcated educational distribution, most of whom enjoy positive or neutral societal
perception and documented legal status, the status transmission process is expected to
unfold in a pattern similar to that of the native population. However, at the lower end of
the educational distribution, group-level boundaries and ethnic resources will play a
greater role.
In response to these theoretical developments, sociologists have gathered several
new metropolitan-level surveys of the children of immigrants. These data, which we
also rely on here, enable the analytic distinction between group- and individual-level

characteristics in predicting second-generation educational attainment, and more
recent studies provide strong evidence for group-level variation in the status
transmission process.
Sources of Group-Level Variation in Intergenerational Transmission
A growing literature now addresses how the relative importance of parents' education
for the educational attainment of their children may vary depending on the importance
of extrafamilial or "group-level" factors that co-determine educational attainment--
processes that are often grouped under the labels "neighborhood," "school," and "peer"
effects. Certainly, extrafamilial influences matter for education in natives and immi-
grant families alike. Yet, in studies of the educational trajectories of the children of
immigrants, additional factors come into play.
Group-Level Effects
One set of factors pertains to the context of reception. Including variables such as host
society perceptions, discrimination, and (parental) legal status as well as the character-
istics of the coethnic community, this concept plays an important role in the segmented
assimilation hypothesis. Migrants from some countries (e.g., Cuba, USSR, Vietnam)
were given easy access to citizenship and other privileges that foster upward mobility
(Portes and Rumbaut 2001). In contrast, other migrant streams are heavily undocu-
mented, facing not only significant barriers in the labor market and exclusion from a
number of public services but also a "ceiling" effect on the educational and occupa-
tional attainment of the young children who migrate with them (Bean et al. 2011;
Gonzales 2011). For the children of such disadvantaged origin groups, foremost
Mexican Americans, attempts at upward mobility may be flattened into a "working
class" incorporation, with the children of both higher- and lower-skilled parents failing
to attain middle class status (Luthra and Waldinger 2013). Societal perceptions also
vary and, as psychological research points out, may be consequential for academic
performance (Steele and Aronson 1995). Some research had argued that positive
stereotypes of minority group academic performance weaken the link between low
parental education and low child education (Lee and Zhou 2013), whereas negative
stereotypes can strengthen it, decreasing mobility (Conchas 2001; Gonzales et al. 2002;
Waters 1999).
Social networks and collective efficacy also play an important role in the larger
literature on the effects of local context on educational outcomes (Sampson et al. 1999).
Although important for migrants and nonmigrants alike, these networks are arguably
tighter for migrants. Examples are extensive ethnic "shadow schooling" systems
commonly found in Asian immigrant enclaves (Foner 2002; Kasinitz et al. 2008;
Zhou and Kim 2006), or the access to elite private coethnic high schools for the
children of Cuban migrants in Miami (Portes and Rumbaut 2001). Another example
is the enforcement of high attainment as a local norm within immigrant communities
(Kao and Tienda 1995). Those growing up in an environment where going to college is
the norm and professional occupations are seen as a minimum level of achievement,
such as the children of Chinese immigrants in New York, feel a stronger social pressure
and expectation of high attainment (Kasinitz et al. 2008). Especially for immigrant
R.R. Luthra, T. Soehl
parents with low levels of education, ethnic social networks can provide an environ-
ment for their children that will isolate them from negative influences and emphasize
educational attainment, weakening the link between low parental attainment and low
offspring attainment found in the general population.
These "group effects" will operate more or less strongly depending on the spatial
dispersion of the group and the ethnic resources available in immigrant enclaves
(Borjas 1992; Gibson 1988; Kasinitz et al. 2008; Zhou and Kim 2006). Mexican-
origin immigrants, who are overwhelmingly working class, are less likely to have
access to coethnic social networks that span social classes (Bean and Stevens 2003). By
contrast, socioeconomically more diverse national origin groups, such as the Koreans
and Chinese (Zhou et al. 2008), benefit from cross-class ties. For highly skilled
immigrants or those who are less geographically concentrated, such as those from the
Philippines (Le Espiritu 2003), ethnic resources may play a smaller role; in such
groups, the effect of parental characteristics may be similar in magnitude to the patterns
found in native families.
Variation in the Concept-Indicator Link Across Groups
In addition to group-level effects related to the context of reception and characteristics
of the immigrant ethnic community in the receiving country, the extreme discrepancies
in educational access and quality across immigrant sending countries provide another
reason both to expect a weaker relationship between parental and child educational
attainment among the children of immigrants in the United States compared with
natives as well as to expect differences in the strength of this relationship between
immigrants of different origins. First, parental education (in years) is a distal measure of
parental human capital: years of education are not directly passed from parent to child.
Rather, parental education is meant to provide a measurable indicator for the "knowl-
edge, skills, health, or values" (Becker 2008) of parents that are expected to influence
the human capital acquisition of children. This in itself is not a problem; social
scientists frequently have to rely on more or less proximal indicators of underlying
concepts. Problems arise, however, when the strength of the link between the indicator
and the concept of interest differs across groups that are then compared.
For instance, in some immigrant-sending countries, access to education is highly
unequal. For example, poor or rural populations may have access to only the most basic
public education, no matter what their intellectual potential. Also, the degree to which
returns to education diminish and thus the incentives to invest in education vary
substantially across countries (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos 2004). Even for those
who do receive formal education, the substantive content of a year of schooling itself
may differ (Fuchs and Wößmann 2007; Hanushek and Kimko 2000). Thus, the average
level--and substantive meaning--of formal education may differ between national
contexts. As Feliciano (2005:844) pointed out, ". . . neglecting educational selectivity,
or relative educational attainment, assumes that a high school degree earned in one
context (say, a country where only 10% of the population has one) has the same
meaning as a high school degree earned in another context (say, where 80% of the
population has one)."
Although these insights are frequently applied to questions of assimilation and cross-
group comparisons, the methodological implications receive scant attention. In the
Educational Attainment in Immigrant Families
following sections, we show how variation in intergenerational transmission of educa-
tional attainment can lead to false conclusions when aggregate-level data are used to
make inferences about individual transmission and when parental educational attain-
ment serves as a "control" variable for family background characteristics, such as
parental human capital.
Methodological Implications of Group-Level Variation in the Transmission
of Educational Attainment
Aggregate Data and Ecological Fallacy
Earlier U.S. research on intergenerational transmission in immigrant families, as well as
current research in some countries with more recent immigrant populations, has relied
on aggregate data to estimate intergenerational transmission coefficients. Lacking data
that links parent and child dyads, these studies have instead regressed educational or
wage averages of the children of immigrants on the average of immigrants of the same
ethnic origins several decades prior. Using this method, a series of highly influential
articles by Borjas (1993, 1994) demonstrated that links in educational attainment and
reported wages between first- and second-generation immigrants, and even between
first- and third-generation immigrants, are strong and significant, suggesting strong
intergenerational transmission. The work by Card and collaborators (2000, 2005), using
similar methods, also found substantial links between immigrant parents and their U.S.-
raised children. The studies by Card and colleagues especially are widely used as an
example for similar work with alternative data sets and other countries (see, for
instance, Aydemir et al. 2013:S110 and Bonikowska and Hou 2010:324 for Canada;
Dustmann 2008:301 for Germany; Nielsen et al. 2003:760 for Denmark; Dustmann and
Glitz 2011:299 and 2011:408 for the United Kingdom, Germany, and France; Bauer
and Riphahn 2007:146 for Switzerland; Park and Myers 2010:374 and Hatton and
Leigh 2011:392 for the United States).
Across a number of countries, studies using aggregate data have consistently found
much higher estimates of transmission than those using comparable micro-/family-level
data. At the same time, intergenerational associations are consistently lower in migrant
than in nonmigrant families (Aydemir et al. 2013; Bauer and Riphahn 2006; Borjas
1992; Dustmann 2008; Gang and Zimmermann 2000; Nielsen et al. 2003; Riphahn
2003).2 Two recent studies, an OECD review of intergenerational mobility studies by
d'Addio (2007:57) and Dustmann and Glitz (2011), noted the discrepancies in different
estimates but did not address the source of the differences.
It is possible to infer individual-level processes, such as intergenerational transmis-
sion, from aggregate-level regressions; however, such inference rests on strong as-
sumptions. One way of stating the condition for accurate cross-level inference is that
the relationship between variables on the individual level is the same across units of
aggregation (Firebaugh 1978; Goodman 1953; Hammond 1973). In our case, this
would mean that the relationship between foreign-born parental education and
second-generation education does not vary across immigrant origin groups. When only
2 A table summarizing these studies in more detail is available from the authors upon request.

aggregate data are available, this of course cannot be evaluated empirically and has to
be assumed.
Another way to state the requirement formally is that for an estimate from aggregate
data to be equivalent to those from individual-level data, in a (hypothetical) individual-
level model, the mean of the independent variable can provide no additional informa-
tion on the outcome variable. We illustrate this with a simple bivariate case: regressing
the educational attainment y (measured in years) of individuals i in group j on an
intercept  and the educational standing (in years) of their parents x. Using the notation
in Eq. (1), the coefficient indicating the effect of the mean education level 2
must be
equal to 0 for this assumption to hold (see also Firebaugh 1978:560):
yij
¼  þ 
1
xij
þ 
2
xj
þ ij
: ð1Þ
Referring to the review of group-level effects described earlier, it is easy to see how
this condition may be violated in models that examine the intergenerational transmis-
sion in immigrant families. In several ways, we can imagine how the mean level of
parental education in a group is associated with second-generation outcomes above and
beyond parental education.
Figure 1 illustrates how aggregation can cause bias. The figure uses data from two
groups, Mexican- and Chinese-origin respondents, from a recent survey of the children
of immigrants in Los Angeles. The regression lines based on individual data for both
groups (gray for Mexicans, black for Chinese) show a relatively weak relationship
between parental and second-generation education as measured in years. The coeffi-
cients are 0.13 and 0.14, respectively. Fitting a line for individuals from both groups,
we get a slope of 0.24 (dashed line). Aggregating and using group means to fit a
regression produces a much steeper line, with a slope coefficient of almost 0.6.
The Use of Parental Education as a Control Variable
The more recent availability of micro-level data on immigrants and their children has
enabled further study of immigrant­native and national origin differences in educa-
tional outcomes as well as the mechanisms underlying these differences. Some of these
studies have focused on the "immigrant effect," comparing the children of immigrants
to children of natives of the same (pan)ethnicity and generally documenting better
outcomes among the foreign-born and children of the foreign-born (Harris et al. 2008;
Thomas 2009; Xie and Greenman 2011). Others have focused on context of reception
and cultural impacts, comparing the children of immigrants of different national
origins; these studies have found large differences in the educational outcomes of
Asian and Hispanic immigrants, for instance, or between the children of immigrants
with more positive versus more negative contexts of reception (Haller et al. 2011;
Kasinitz et al. 2008; Waters et al. 2010). Finally, many authors have sought to find the
specific mechanisms underlying variation in educational outcomes among the children
of immigrants, employing national origins merely as controls and focusing instead on
gender (Feliciano 2012), neighborhood context (Xie and Greenman 2011), or attitudes
and peer school context (Greenman 2013). The majority of these authors have argued
that the nativity, immigrant origin, or mechanism coefficients they observed in rela-
tionship to educational outcomes are "net of" or "controlling for" parental background,
Educational Attainment in Immigrant Families
which is measured as parental education, income, and/or occupational status. Yet, with
the exception of Thomas (2009), all these studies employed additive models of parental
education or socioeconomic background, assuming uniform effects across different
groups or allowing effects to differ only between very broad panethnic groups (Xie and
Greenman 2011).
In individual-level studies of second-generation educational attainment, parental
educational attainment serves as an indicator, or a "plug-in" proxy variable (see
discussion in Wooldridge 2003:296) for the unmeasured set of parental characteristics
that the researcher deems relevant for educational attainment. Most of these studies
implicitly relied on a model of second-generation educational attainment y that recog-
nizes the effect of a set of parental characteristics x2

children, alongside other variables of interest such as parental origin or ethnicity,

Again, following from our earlier review, because there are clear reasons to suspect
that the strength of the link between x2

will
be correlated with independent variables x1
, such as parental country of origin. Failing
to control for potential differences in the educational status transmission process may
therefore lead to biased estimates of other relationships of interest to migration scholars
besides educational transmission.
Although "true" human capital is unobservable, we can empirically demonstrate
how failing to account for variation in the strength of educational transmission leads to
biased estimates of the differences in the educational attainments of different national
origin groups.
Similar to the model underlying Fig. 1, we regress years of education on the highest
parental education, here focusing on the children of Mexican immigrants and of native
non-Hispanic whites. In Fig. 2, we present the predicted years of education from two
specifications: a model that assumes a homogeneous relationship between parental
education and second-generation attainment (dashed lines) and a model allowing the
strength of intergenerational transmission to differ across groups.3
We see that the predicted years of respondent education, particularly at the highest
and lowest levels of parental education, differ between the additive and interactive
3 This model is unweighted. The difference in expected education will differ depending on weights used;
because the children of native whites are a much larger percentage of the U.S. population than the children of
any foreign-born group, in weighted models that also assume homogeneous educational transmission will
more closely approximate the native white transmission pattern and will deviate more severely from most
immigrant origin patterns.
Educational Attainment in Immigrant Families
models. For the children of native whites with only eight years of education, for
instance, the difference in expected years of education is an entire year. At the other
end of the spectrum, at 16 years of parental education, the difference in expected
education for native-born whites is 0.14 years, and assuming homogenous slopes
overestimates the attainment of the children of Mexican immigrants by one-fourth of
a year. Rather than "holding all else equal," we get comparisons that are not appropri-
ately matched, and failing to account for different levels of educational transmission
makes groups appear more or less disadvantaged than they likely are. In some cases,
including more socioeconomic, behavioral, and attitudinal controls might reduce this
bias. Still, many of these variables will, to some degree, suffer from the same problems
as educational attainment.

of national origin groups, enabling us to estimate intergenerational transmission of
education using both individual-level and aggregate-level data. Three of these surveys
sampled second-generation respondents in four different metropolitan areas in the
United States: the Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan
Los Angeles (IIMMLA) survey; the Immigrant Second Generation in
Metropolitan New York survey (ISGMNY); and the Children of Immigrants
Longitudinal Survey (CILS), which surveyed the children of immigrants in San
Diego and Miami. In addition, we rely on the National Education Longitudinal
Study (NELS), which provides nationally representative samples of several na-
tional origin groups.
Data
Second-Generation Surveys: IIMMLA, ISGMNY, and CILS
These three surveys, collected specifically for the study of the children of post-1965
immigrants, all provide extensive information on respondents' educational trajectory as
well as the educational background of their parents. Although these surveys have the
disadvantage of not being nationally representative, they employ quota sampling and
thus provide sufficient samples for national origin groups that a nationally representa-
tive sample could not capture.
& ISGMNY, conducted in 1998 and 1999, entailed a telephone survey, interviewing
3,415 young adults, aged 18 to 32 in New York City and its surrounding suburbs.
The survey targeted second-generation Chinese, Dominicans, Russian Jews, West
Indians, and Central Americans from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It also includes
comparison groups of native blacks, Puerto Ricans, and non-Hispanic whites.
& Also a telephone survey, IIMMLA was conducted in 2004 and collected approxi-
mately 4,500 interviews with young adults aged 20 to 39 in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area, comprising Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside, and San
Bernardino counties. The sample has quotas for second- and 1.5-generation groups
(Mexicans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, Koreans, Chinese, and Central Americans from
Guatemala and El Salvador) and includes three native-parentage comparison groups
composed of third- and later-generation Mexican-Americans, non-Hispanic whites,
and blacks.
& CILS involved a longitudinal survey of immigrant offspring living in San
Diego (California) and Miami/Ft. Lauderdale (Florida). The original survey
was conducted in 1992, with samples of second-generation children attend-
ing the eighth and ninth grades in public and private schools in the
metropolitan areas of Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and San Diego. The students
were sampled again in 1995­1996, and finally in 2001­2003. Because we
are interested in the final educational attainment, we use Wave 3 of the
data, which provides 3,334 respondents. In Wave 2, CILS also asked about
parental education and directly interviewed the parents of approximately
one-half of the original respondents. We use this additional information in
supplementary analyses to assess the impact of error in children's reports of
parental education on our estimates.
Educational Attainment in Immigrant Families
National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS)
During the spring term of the 1987­1988 school year, the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES) initiated a nationally representative longitudinal
study of 8th grade students attending 1,052 high schools across the United
States. We restrict our analysis to the fourth wave collected in 2000, which
interviewed 12,144 young adults.
To make our work comparable to previous research and to reduce issues of censor-
ing, we use only respondents of an age when most will have finished their educational
careers. For IIMMLA, ISGMNY and NELS, we restrict our samples to respondents
ages 25 and older. Because the CILS surveyed a younger population, we have to use a
lower cutoff and have a sample between ages 23 and 25. We further control for age at
time of survey. We define the second generation as children who have at least one
foreign-born parent and who were born in the United States or arrived before starting
primary school (less than 5 years old).4
Variables
National Origin
For IIMMLA, CILS, and the ISGMNY, we code national origin as respondent's place
of birth. When the respondent was born in the United States, we use mother's place of
birth; where this is missing or in the United States, we use father's birthplace. NELS
does not provide detailed information on parent's place of birth. For this survey, we use
respondent's reported ethnic origin. We include groups with at least 30 valid observa-
tions in the analysis.
Respondent's Years of Education
The data available on respondents years of education differ across the surveys:
IIMMLA data contain greater detail on grade level and time spent in college,
and provide a variable that maps this information into years of education
(ranging from 6 to 20 years). ISGMNY contains less detail about early school-
ing; we code the lowest educational category (some grade school) at 6 years of
education. CILS data were collected in schools during early adolescence and
thus are left-censored at 10 years of schooling; the cutoff for NELS data is 9
years. All data have 20 years of education as the highest category.
Parental Years of Education
For ISGMNY and IIMMLA, we coded parental education using the same coding
routine as described earlier for the respondents. The IIMMLA included a small number
of parents with no formal schooling, which we coded as 0 years of education. CILS
provides only categorical measures of educational attainment for respondent's parents,
4 Our results are robust to using a more restrictive definition that includes only U.S.-born children of two
foreign-born parents.

with the lowest level at elementary school or less (coded as 6 years of education)
and the highest level at college graduate or more (coded 16). Similarly, NELS
provides categorical measures of parental education that begin at "did not finish
high school" (coded 10). The highest level of education, "Ph.D., M.D. etc.," is
coded as 20 years of education.
We code the number of years of formal education both the respondent's mother and
the father received and then define parental education as the highest of the two. Our
results are substantively robust to using either father's or mother's education as the
independent variable.
Results
We first summarize and describe the distributions of parental and respondent's educa-
tion data for each national origin group sampled. We present means and variances. We
then calculate changes in these parameters between parents and children as well as the
regression coefficient of respondents on parents' education. This information is sum-
marized in Table 1.
We see that for the majority of the immigrant groups, the children have a
higher average education than their parents and that their distributions are far
more compressed. Thus, not only do the children of immigrants have higher
educational attainment than their parents, but there is also less within-group
inequality in the second generation.
The last two columns of Table 1 show the estimated slope coefficients and
standard errors from a linear regression of respondents' education on parental
education measured in years, controlling for age. The slopes vary significantly
across groups, ranging from being statistically not different from 0 to a
maximum of 0.41. Thus, a key assumption of both aggregate regression and
human capital controls--that the relationship between parental and respondent
education is equal across groups--is not satisfied. More specifically, we see
that among immigrant groups, with the exception of Filipinos, Colombians,
and Indians, the effect of parental education is substantially smaller than for
whites with native parents where the regression coefficient ranges from 0.28
(NELS) to 0.31 (IIMMLA) to as high as 0.41 in the ISGMNY data--coeffi-
cients of the same magnitude as the ones quoted by Card and colleagues
(2000, 2005). Among native blacks, the influence of parental education is
similar: 0.28 in the ISGMNY data but a bit lower in the NELS and IIMM
LA data. Only among the children of native-born Puerto Ricans in our New
York (ISGMNY) data is parental influence as low as that observed among the
children of immigrants. This may be a consequence of the particular sample of
Puerto Ricans in the ISGMNY, who are more likely to live in the same ethnic
enclaves as the foreign-born and thus are subject to similar transmission
processes as immigrants.
In contrast, for native-born (third- and later-generation) families with Mexican
ancestry in the Los Angeles area, the effect of parental education on respondent's
education is 0.39, significantly higher than the coefficients observed amongst the
second-generation groups. Given that third- and later-generation Mexican-origin fam-
ilies are more likely to disperse into majority Anglo neighborhoods than Puerto Ricans

Educational Attainment in Immigrant Families
or Cubans (South et al. 2005), generation status may be a stronger indicator for
community-level influences on the association in education among those of
Mexican origin.
Model 1 in Table 2 replicates previous aggregate analyses. We average our measures
of education and age by origin group and then use these aggregate data to regress
respondent's education on parental education. The slope coefficient of this regression is
0.35, and after we weight each national origin group to represent their proportion of the
U.S. foreign-born population as of 2000 (Model 1b), we obtain a regression coefficient
of 0.43. These are coefficients of the same magnitude as the one found by Card et al.
(2000) and Card (2005), using the same methodology.5 They are also significantly
higher than almost all the estimates of intergenerational transmission within groups in
Table 1.
Model 2 uses the individual-level data for all immigrant groups from all four
surveys, weighted for their representation among the foreign-born, thus giving an
average of the effect of parental education in immigrant families. This model also
includes dummy variables for each national origin to net out differences in average
education levels of groups. The slope estimate for the effect of the transmission of
parental educational attainment is 0.11, which is significantly lower than the 0.3 to 0.4
estimated for nonmigrant families.
Model 3 again uses pooled individual-level data for all immigrant groups from all
surveys, weighted for their representation among the foreign-born, but does not include
fixed effects for national origin. Even in this specification, the transmission rate remains
low at only 0.17.6
Finally, in Model 4, we replicate Borjas (1992) and estimate a random-
effects generalized least squares model including individual information on
parental education as well as the mean parental education of each group--in
effect, estimating Eq. (1) from earlier and disaggregating the individual- and
group-level effects. As expected, the effect of average education in the group
2
is not 0 (or negligible) as would be required for reliable inference with
group-level data, but in fact is larger than the effect of parental attainment by a
factor of about 2. Taken together, these two coefficients add up to the
aggregate-data estimate obtained in Model 1.
Variation in Intergenerational Transmission of Education
Although immigrants in general have much lower rates of intergenerational transmis-
sion than natives, there is considerable variation in the strength of intergenerational
transmission by national origins. To examine this variation, Fig. 3 plots the regression
coefficients in Table 1 against the mean parental education and the dispersion
of parental education in each group. Mean parental education and the dispersion of
parental education of the origin group in the United States serve here as indicators
of the coethnic community and sending country allocation of education, which are two
5 Replicating regressions using the mean level of education of adults from the same origin group at the
metropolitan level from the census gives similar results: .31 unweighted and .51 weighted.
6 Coefficients obtained without weights are 0.12 for Model 2 and 0.19 for Model 3.

variables that may determine the relative importance of individual transmission and
group-level effects.
As the graphs in the figure show, in groups with higher average educational
attainment among the immigrant parents, the parent­child association in education is
significantly stronger than in groups with low average attainment. In contrast, higher
within-group variation in education is associated with weaker parent­child association.
These associations point to a number of mechanisms. First, for immigrants from countries
with poor quality (as indicated by low mean) and unequal (as indicated by larger standard
deviation) education systems, parental education will be a relatively worse indicator of the
family characteristics that matter for the educational attainment of the second generation.
Second, members of national origin groups with higher average education will rely
less on community-level resources (ethnic capital) and are less likely to live in distinct
neighborhoods where national origin overlaps with peer characteristics and the avail-
ability of extrafamilial educational support systems. In addition, any ethnic social
capital will be most effective when human capital differs significantly within the group:
for instance, in the case of the Chinese in New York (Kasinitz et al. 2008) or the
Vietnamese in New Orleans (Zhou and Bankston 1994).
Measurement Error and Other Caveats
One possible objection to this analysis may be the issue of measurement error. As
Borjas (1992) discussed, measurement error in parental education (because of recall
error, for example) may increase the estimate of the effect of mean education of the
group 2
. Acting as an instrument, mean parental education may capture some of the
"lost" individual-level effects.
Using a subset of our data, we directly address this issue. CILS asked second-
generation respondents in Waves 1 and 2 about parental education and included a
parental questionnaire for a subset of the sample. Although highly correlated (.77),
responses are not perfectly consistent. To assess the extent to which this measurement
error may attenuate the coefficients for intergenerational transmission and inflate
"group effects," we use all three measures of parental education as indicators of
a latent variable that enters the regression equation for educational outcomes along
with a vector of the origin group means. Thus, we take the "true" educational
attainment of a parent as a latent variable i
measured by a vector of observed indicators
xi
. In our case, xi
has length 3, combining the respondents' answers about their parents'
education in Wave 1 and Wave 2 as well as the parental questionnaire where available.
Factor loadings  and intercepts  relate these indicators to our unmeasured variable
parental education, leaving residuals i
. This measurement model can be written as
xi
¼  þ 
i
þ i
: ð6Þ
In conjunction with Eq. (1), this gives us a regression coefficient for family-level
transmission of education that is not attenuated by measurement error.
Table 3 summarizes the results. For comparison, we include regression models
analog to those in Model 4 from Table 2. Using measures of fathers' education, we
see that the latent variable estimate of parental transmission is indeed somewhat higher
compared with the regression estimates, and the effect of national origin education is a
Educational Attainment in Immigrant Families
bit lower. In the case of mothers' education, we see a similar pattern in the estimate of
the parental transmission, but the "group effect" does not reach statistical significance
in either the regression or the latent variable models. We conclude that measurement
error does introduce some upward bias on the estimated effect of characteristics of the
national origin groups and some downward bias on the estimate of family-level
transmission. However, the magnitude of this bias is not large enough to substantively
alter the conclusions of our analysis.
Finally, we want to briefly address three other caveats. First, the majority of our data
come from metropolitan areas with large numbers of immigrants residing in ethnic
neighborhoods. Our article therefore best represents the experiences of immigrants and
their children in traditional gateway cities. However, traditional metropolitan destina-
tions still reflect the experience of the majority of the immigrants in the United States:
according to the U.S. census in 2010, 85 % lived in the 100 largest metropolitan areas.
To further assess whether a national-level sample would differ, we replicated all the
earlier analyses using only the NELS national-level data, applying survey weights for
national representativeness. The substantive finding remained the same: the effect of
average group education level (0.33, for 10 groups) was much larger than the effect of
individual-level parental education (0.19).
Second, there is some discrepancy in the characteristics of immigrant national origin
groups across surveys. For instance, estimates of intergenerational transmission among
Mexicans in the IIMMLA and NELS survey are higher and are statistically significant,
whereas estimates from CILS data are lower and not statistically significant at conven-
tional levels. Many differences between each survey could account for these differ-
ences, including the sampling at different ages (youth in NELS and CILS, and adults in
IIMMLA and ISGMNY) as well as differences between metropolitan areas and
national averages. Ultimately, we cannot pin down the cause for these differences,
and we take comfort in the estimates being substantively consistent: for instance,
Filipinos consistently have the highest levels of intergenerational transmission, whereas
most of the groups show estimates that are below 0.2.

Finally, with the expansion of higher education systems in various migrant-sending
countries in recent decades, we might expect that the intergenerational transmission of
education among children of immigrants from countries with lower average educational
attainment to be stronger among more recent cohorts of immigrants. Documenting such
changes may be a fruitful avenue for further research.
Discussion
This article demonstrates that intergenerational transmission of education is weaker
within immigrant families than in native families and that the strength of the transmis-
sion differs between immigrants of different national origins. The existence of signif-
icant group-level effects on the educational transmission process violates the uniformity
assumption underpinning the use of both aggregate data and parental background
"controls" in studies of immigrant intergenerational change.
Estimates based on aggregate data subsume both group-level effects as well as
individual-level transmission processes. Yet, contemporary theories of assimilation
highlight the analytical distinction between individual-level (or family-level) processes
on the one hand and national origin differences in ethnic resources and immigrant
contexts of reception ("group-level effects") on the other. Thus the "cross-level infer-
ence problem" relates to the conceptual distinction between individuals and ethnic
categories in social science analysis. As the broader literature on race, ethnicity, and
nationalism shows, ethnicity and group-level processes certainly play a role in life
chances, but ethnic groups are not the building blocks of society and cannot be the units
of coherent social science analysis (Brubaker 2004).
Our analysis suggests that the relationship between formal education and the
socioeconomic and human capital traits that encourage children's academic
attainment varies across immigrant groups and, quite systematically, between
immigrants and natives. Immigrants and natives are educated in fundamentally
different education systems and therefore--from the point of view of education
as a selection mechanism or a sorting by abilities--have educations that are not
commensurate. Thus "controlling for education" (or for parental education) may
be a statistical exercise of dubious value in analyses that compare immigrants
of different origins or immigrants and the U.S.-born.
Our article has two concrete implications. First, individual-level data are necessary
for the measurement of intergenerational continuity in socioeconomic characteristics in
immigrant families and especially for comparisons across time and between different
immigrant origin groups and the native-born. Second, our article cautions against the
common practice to "control for education" in analyses that contain immigrant and
natives as a way of taking human capital into account or to control for parental
education in analyses of the second generation and natives as a way of controlling
for the human capital of parents. Fortunately, the most recent data on U.S. immigrant
families (such as those used in this article) now enable researchers to include additional
controls for the aptitudes, values, and resources hypothesized to drive the different
transmission rates across ethnic groups. Beyond the United States, a promising new
line of research posits using measures of "relative educational attainments," or the
educational position of the immigrant in the distribution of the country of origin (Ichou
Educational Attainment in Immigrant Families
2014), as a more universal control for parental background when making adjusted
comparisons of second-generation outcomes.
This study also establishes that national origin average educational level and dispersion
moderate the intergenerational transmission process. We show that the strength of the
correlation between immigrant parent and child is positively related to the average level of
education and inversely related to the educational variance of the immigrant origin group.
We interpret this finding as evidence that among the more highly educated and educationally
homogeneous immigrant origin groups, who are less likely to live in ethnic enclaves and rely
on ethnic resources, extrafamilial influences will play a smaller role.
Indeed, this interpretation aligns with what we know about immigrants with the
largest intergenerational coefficients: those of Indian and Filipino origin. Both migra-
tion streams are dominated by middle-class professionals, educated in formerly
colonialized English language schooling systems, the former displaying strong cultural
and linguistic ties with the United Kingdom and the United States and the latter the
largest former U.S.-colonized immigrant group in the United States (Cheng and Yang
1998; Le Espiritu 2003). These groups arrive with high levels of human capital,
linguistic acculturation, and formal legal status. Their rapid socioeconomic absorption
into the "middle-class mainstream" creates patterns of intergenerational transmission
similar to that of native whites. On the other hand, the Vietnamese, Korean, and
Chinese origin groups with very low intergenerational transmission rates reside in
strong ethnic enclaves that promote high rates of upward intergenerational mobility
among even the most disadvantaged members.
On average, and especially in migrant streams with low levels of education, parental
education is much less predictive of the educational outcomes of the second generation
than estimates based on aggregate data suggest. On the one hand, this bodes well for the
long-term impacts of low-educated immigration streams on inequality in the United
States. On the other hand, a variety of extrafamilial influences still create ethnically
stratified outcomes in second-generation educational attainment. Current research that
focuses on the sources of group-level heterogeneity in intergenerational mobility
(Luthra and Waldinger 2013), as well as within-group variation in the relative strength
of family- versus group-level effects (Alba et al. 2014), should enable the further
development of theory in this area.
