One of the common health problems of adults worldwide and in
the United States is hypertension. In the United States about 29%
of adults have hypertension.1,2 Hypertension constitutes a signif-
icant attributable cause of coronary heart disease, heart failure,
stroke, renal disease, and glaucoma.1,3,4 Due to loss of human
life and high cost of the management and treatment of hyper-
tension, and its complications, many recommendations have
been forwarded to help prevent it.5­7 Notable among these rec-
ommendations is a reduction in dietary sodium (salt) intake.5,6,8
This recommendation is warranted because excessive sodium
consumption has been associated with hypertension and fluid
retention.5,8­10 In the United States, about 75% of the sodium in
the diet comes from salt (NaCl) added by food manufacturers
and restaurants.5,11 Salt consumption lingers around 4,000mg/
day,5,8 far above the 2,400mg/day 
recommended intake.5
Restriction of dietary salt consumption as a treatment
option for hypertension could mean a significant curtailing
of iodine intake and hence risk of iodine deficiency. Iodized
salt contains small but substantial amount of the essential
mineral iodine. In the human body, iodine is required for the
production of 
thyroid hormones notably, thyroxine (T4
) and
triiodothyronine (T3
), which are required for the regulation
of various physiological processes including growth, neuro-
logical development, body weight, temperature, and rate of
oxidation in cells. Regular consumption of iodized salt is an
effective prophylaxis against iodine deficiency.11,12 Iodine defi-
ciency causes deficiency of the thyroid hormones which sub-
sequently results in iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), a major
public health problem in many countries.13 Of great concern
among the IDD are developmental failure, mental retardation,
neurological damage, dwarfism, hearing loss, and decreased
intelligence quotient in children.13­15 In adults, IDD results
in hypothyroidism, infertility, thyroid cancer, goiter, poor

cognition, lethargy, and decreased labor productivity.13­16
In the United States, iodized salt was introduced all over the
continent within a short period in 1924 to obviate IDD,14,17
and voluntary salt iodization was embraced thereafter.
Hitherto, IDD were a major health problem. Per the mandate
of the United States Food and Drug Administration, domestic
iodized salt is fortified with up to 0.01% potassium iodide or

Hypertension, Dietary Salt Restriction,
and Iodine Deficiency Among Adults
Francis A.K.Tayie1 and Katie Jourdan2
Background
A common recommendation for the treatment of hypertension is
dietary salt intake restriction. However, dietary salt is one of the major
sources of iodine.This study evaluated the association between
dietary salt restriction and iodine deficiency among adults in the
United States.
Methods
Multiple regression models, which controlled for confounders,
were used to evaluate the association between hypertension
conditions, salt restriction and iodine deficiency among 996 men
and 960 women in the blood pressure and iodine subsamples of the
2001­2004 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES).
Results
High proportions of men (24.96%) and women (40.42%) were iodine
deficient. Current hypertension or having a history of hypertension
among men and women did not associate significantly with iodine
deficiency or high iodine status, compared with those without
current or history of hypertension. Compared with men not
restricting dietary salt, salt restriction did not associate significantly
with iodine deficiency among men. Compared with women not
restricting dietary salt, women who were restricting dietary salt
associated with significantly lower urinary iodine concentration
(UIC), P = 0.01, and were more likely to be iodine deficient, adjusted
odds ratios, 1.79, P = 0.03.
Conclusions
Salt restriction associated with iodine deficiency among women
but not men. Alternative sources of iodine should be suggested to
persons who are consuming low levels of iodine such as women
if they need to restrict dietary salt intake. Among those iodine
deficient, health professionals should enquire about salt restriction.

copper iodide as iodine sources.14 Each gram of iodized salt
contains about 77g of iodine (100g potassium iodide) at the
production level.11,12 Taking cognizance of intake levels, food
processing effects, and cooking losses, this level of fortification
could contribute about 50g iodine to the average person's
daily iodine need of 150µg.11­13
Measurement of iodine levels in urine is frequently done to
assess a person's current iodine nutritional status13,15 because
iodine intake and renal excretion tend to be in a steady state
which approximates iodine nutritional status.15,18 In this study,
we evaluated the likelihood of iodine deficiency due to hyper-
tension and salt restriction.
Methods
Sources of data and study sample. The blood pressure and
iodine subsamples from the 2001­2002 and 2003­2004
waves of the United States National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES 2001­2004) were used for this
study. The NHANES is an ongoing population-based survey,
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to monitor and
assess the health status of the noninstitutionalized United
States civilian population.19 The NHANES 2001­2004 uses
a stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling method
and include interviews, physical examination, and laboratory
tests of participants from representative households. In 1999,
NHANES was converted from a static survey to a continuous
annual survey.20 Data collected over successive 2-year intervals
are periodically released for public use. The NHANES survey
data are released together with analytical guides, related notes,
and analytical survey weights to ensure unbiased estimation of
population averages.21
Data from participants in the blood pressure and iodine
subsamples of the NHANES 2001­2004 mobile examina-
tion center (MEC) were matched into a combined dataset. In
the NHANES 2001­2004, subsamples that are representative
of the noninstitutionalized United States civilian population
provided data on urinary iodine.22 The final sample for this
study comprised participants who had characteristics compa-
rable to the general NHANES population. Inclusion criteria
were: ages 20­60 years, nonpregnant, and had complete blood

pressure, urinary iodine, and gender information. Participants
aged 20­60 years were included to avoid the complex influ-
ence of age on blood pressure and glomerular filtration.23
The NHANES 2001­2004 MEC blood pressure subsamples
included only those 20 years and over. The final combined
dataset comprised 1,956 participants, 1,043 from NHANES
2001­2002, and 913 from the NHANES 2003­2004. Of the
final dataset, 996 were men and 960 were women.
Sociodemographic information: age, gender, income, eth-
nicity, and education, were obtained from the NHANES
demographic questionnaire data files.19 Physical activity infor-
mation was obtained from the physical activity and physical
fitness data files whereas body weight and body mass index
(BMI) data were from the MEC body measures data files.19
Urinary creatinine and albumin information were obtained
from the NHANES 2001­2004 MEC laboratory data files.19
The Ethics Review Board of the National Center for Health
Statistics approved the survey procedures and informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants.19 The procedures for
this study were approved locally by the Institutional Review
Board, Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, Central
Michigan University.
Identification of hypertension and measurement of blood
pressure. Participants were categorized as hypertensive if they
had a mean systolic blood pressure of 140mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure of 90mm Hg or affirmed current use of anti-
hypertension medication.1,24,25 They had history of hyperten-
sion if they had ever been told by a health professional that
they had hypertension but were not hypertensive at the time
of examination.26 In the NHANES, blood pressure was meas-
ured manually by a trained technician using a mercury sphyg-
momanometer by following a standard protocol.4,26 Repeated
measurements were done and acceptable values were averaged
and recorded.4,26 In this study, the first blood pressure read-
ing was discarded and the second and third blood pressure
readings were used, because the first reading was consistently
higher than the second and the third, which were closer. The
blood pressure measurement protocols were identical for the
2001­2002 and 2003­2004 waves of NHANES.4,26
Identification of dietary salt restriction. The NHANES 2001­
2004 blood pressure questionnaire contained questions related
to dietary salt restriction: "told to reduce sodium for hyperten-
sion?," "now reducing sodium/salt?" whereas the dietary inter-
view questionnaire included current use of salt substitute, and
salt use in cooking or at the table." Participants who affirmed
the "told to reduce sodium for hypertension?," "now reducing
sodium/salt?," were using salt substitute, and did not use salt
in cooking or at the table," inclusively, satisfied the criteria for
dietary salt restriction.26
Dietary sodium intake. To enhance the validity and to buttress
the salt restriction questions, dietary sodium intake was assessed
in relation to hypertension conditions and dietary salt restric-
tion. Data on dietary sodium intake were obtained from the
NHANES 2001­2004 MEC dietary interview questionnaire.19
In the NHANES 2001­2004, dietary sodium intake was assessed
by a multiple-pass in-person 24-h dietary recall 
method.19 In
this study, dietary sodium intake was dichotomized as: mod-
erate, 2,400mg/day and high, >2,400mg/day, using the Joint
National Committee's guidelines for sodium intake.5,25
Determining urinary iodine concentration and iodine nutri-
tional status. The NHANES 2001­2004 MEC laboratory data
files contained urinary iodine concentration (UIC) data.27
Iodine nutritional status was determined using urinary iodine
cutoffs defined by the World Health Organization and used by
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.28,29 Three catego-
ries were defined as follows: iodine deficient, UIC <100g/l;
adequate, 100­199g/l; and high iodine status, 200g/l.27

Hypertension, Salt Restriction, and Iodine Deficiency
During the NHANES, spot urine samples were used for the
assessment of iodine nutritional status. Determination of UIC
was done by means of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Dynamic
Reaction Cell Mass Spectroscopy. The laboratory method used
for the determination of UIC is publicly available.22,26
Statistical analysis and confounding variable. To account for
MEC complex probability sampling design and to apply MEC
sampling weights, STATA 10.0 (STATA, College Station, TX)
was used to estimate all descriptive and inferential statistics.20
The SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical software
was used for data organization. In all analyses, the NHANES
2001­2002 and 2003­2004 MEC iodine subsample weights
were halved and applied.21,30 We initially performed gender-
stratified descriptive comparisons of proportions that were
iodine deficient, had high iodine level or had moderate 
dietary
sodium intake for participants who satisfied the following
exposure variables: (i) had history of hypertension but was not
hypertensive at the time of examination; (ii) had clinical hyper-
tension at the time of examination; (iii) was restricting dietary
salt intake. The referent groups were participants who had no
history of hypertension, were normotensive, not restricting die-
tary salt, respectively. Multiple regression models were used to
estimate mean UIC and dietary sodium intake whereas logistic
regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios
for iodine deficiency, high iodine status, and moderate dietary
sodium intake (sodium intake 2,400mg/day) for the expo-
sure variables 1­3 above. The referent group for the 
moderate
sodium intake was those who had high sodium intake (sodium
intake >2,400mg/day). Significant differences among the con-
tinuous variables in the background data were tested using
the overall F-test. Significant differences in the mean UIC and
dietary sodium intake within the hypertension and salt restric-
tion categories were tested using a t-test. For 
categorical data,
Pearson's 2-test of independence with Rao and Scott correc-
tion was used to test for significant differences.31,32 To improve
estimator reliability, we controlled for age, body mass index,
education, income, physical activity, and ethnicity in all the
regression analyses. While a large and a small frame person
can have the same BMI, they are not likely to consume the
same quantity of food and therefore sodium. Therefore, dietary
sodium intakes were adjusted for body weight whereas all other
estimations were adjusted for BMI instead. Dietary sodium,
urinary albumin, urinary creatinine, and urinary iodine data
were log-transformed to achieve normality. Renal differences
were corrected using urinary creatinine and urinary albumin
concentrations. Controlling for urinary creatinine levels helped
to correct for differences in hydration state such as dehydration
or polyuria. Renal disease was corrected using urinary albumin
and creatinine concentrations. Abnormal 
urinary albumin and
creatinine concentrations are indicative of renal disease.24,33,34
Due to small sample sizes for some ethnic groups, they were
collapsed into three categories: black (non-Hispanic), Mexican-
American and other Hispanics, and white (non-Hispanic). The
white (non-Hispanic) category included other white ethnicity.
Education was collapsed into three 
levels: less than high school
degree, high school degree, and above high school degree.
Physical activity was self-reported as less than average, same
as average, and greater than the average American. Although
physical activity was self-reported, it has been found reliable
in many studies.35,36 The referent groups for the categorical
confounding variables were high school degree, average physi-
cal activity level, and white (non-Hispanic). All categorical
confounding variables were examined as indicator variables.
Income was examined as a continuous variable in the form of
poverty income ratio, a ratio of the federal poverty threshold
provided by the Bureau of Census. Age, body weight, BMI,
urinary 
creatinine, and urinary albumin concentrations were

examined as continuous variables. In all analyses, statistical sig-
nificance was tested at P < 0.05.
Results
Sample characteristics
The characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1.
Among this sample, 24.7% of the men and 26.0% of women
had hypertension. Of these, 15.5% of the men and 15.6% of the
women were taking blood pressure medication. Dietary salt
restriction was reported by 13.6% of the men and 12.8% of the
women. Some of the men (5.9%) and women (4.6%) 
restricting
dietary salt were normotensive at the time of examination.
Overall, 25.4 and 32.5% of the men and women, respectively,
had moderate dietary sodium intake (sodium 2,400mg/
day). On the whole, 26.1% of the men restricting dietary
salt intake had moderate sodium intake (sodium 2,400mg/
day), 
compared to 24.9% for men not restricting salt intake.
However, 41.3% of the women restricting dietary salt intake
had moderate sodium intake (sodium 2,400mg/day), com-
pared to 28.9% of the women not restricting salt intake. The
unadjusted mean UIC was (g/l): men, 149.9 (s.e., 9.2; n =
996) and women, 122.2 (s.e., 8.9; n = 960). Overall, 25.0% of
men and 40.4% of women had UIC <100g/l and thus were
deemed iodine deficient.27
Blood pressure, dietary salt restriction, and iodine
nutritional status
The initial descriptive comparisons did not show significant
associations between hypertension conditions and iodine
nutritional status. It is worth mentioning however, that a
substantial percentage of women restricting dietary salt were
iodine deficient, 47.7%, compared with women not restrict-
ing dietary salt, 39.4%, (Table 2). The adjusted mean dietary
sodium intake and UIC of participants by hypertension cat-
egories are shown in Table 3. In men and women, current
hypertension or having a history of hypertension did not asso-
ciate with statistically significant differences in dietary sodium
intake and UIC, compared with those without history of or
who have current hypertension, respectively.
Table 4 shows the adjusted mean dietary sodium intake and
UIC of participants by salt restriction status. In both men and
women, dietary salt restriction did not associate with statisti-
cally significant decreases in the adjusted mean dietary sodium
intakes. Among men, dietary salt restriction did not associate

original contributions Hypertension, Salt Restriction, and Iodine Deficiency
with a statistically significant decrease in the adjusted mean
UIC compared with men not restricting dietary salt intake.
However, among women, dietary salt restriction associated
with a statistically significant decrease in the adjusted mean
UIC compared with women not restricting dietary salt intake
(Table 4).
Results of the logistic regression analysis, which 
controlled
for confounders, indicated that, in both men and women,
current hypertension or having a history of hypertension
was not significantly associated with likelihood of iodine
deficiency, high iodine status, or moderate sodium intake,
compared with those without current or history of hyperten-
sion (Table 3). Among men, salt restriction did not associate

significantly with likelihood of iodine deficiency, high iodine
status, or 
moderate sodium intake compared with men not

restricting dietary salt intake (Table 4). However, women who
were restricting dietary salt were more likely to have moderate
sodium intake, P = 0.02, have lower adjusted mean UIC, P =
0.01, and be iodine deficient, P = 0.03, compared with women
not restricting dietary salt intake (Table 4).
Discussion
Significant findings
Current hypertension per se or having a history of hyperten-
sion did not associate significantly with iodine nutritional
status in both men and women. However, dietary salt restric-
tion among women associated significantly with moderate
salt intake and iodine deficiency. This study provides evidence

Hypertension, Salt Restriction, and Iodine Deficiency
that, among this sample, dietary salt restriction associates with
iodine deficiency in women.
Interpretations and relationship to published literature
Although the mean UIC for men and women were both above
the cutoff for iodine deficiency, the prevalence of iodine defi-
ciency among the participants was high, especially among the
women. The high prevalence of iodine deficiency among adults
has serious health repercussions because the outcome of iodine
deficiency is IDD.13­16 Literature on studies that link dietary salt
restriction to iodine nutritional status is scarce. One study in
Poland reported a decrease in UIC among 
persons consuming
limited amount of iodized salt as well as among hypertension
patients.37 In the present study, we provide evidence that the
association between salt restriction and iodine deficiency may
be true for women but may not be for men in this population.
We observed that women tended to have lower UIC than men
(Table 3), implying that salt restriction among women could
have greater overall effect on the already lower iodine levels. It
is possible that the different associations observed for men and
women may be due to differences in absolute levels of iodine.
It is thus likely that dietary salt restriction may associate with
iodine deficiency in persons with limited iodine intake irre-
spective of gender. A recent study has ingeminated the possible
difficulties in maintaining essential mineral balance, including
iodine, while cutting salt to achieve sodium balance in hyper-
tensives.38 This is partly because salt is a source of essential
minerals such as iodine, iron, zinc, and manganese.13,14 Thus
cutting salt to achieve sodium balance may mean an indirect
curtailing of the intake of such minerals.
In men, dietary salt restriction did not associate with mod-
erate dietary sodium intake (sodium intake 2,400mg/
day).
In women, however, dietary salt restriction associated with

moderate dietary sodium intake. Even though salt restric-
tion did not show a statistically significant decrease in die-
tary sodium intake in men, it was limiting enough in women
to influence iodine nutritional status. It is likely that those
restricting salt may have more control on salt used at home,
most of which is iodized,11,39 than the mostly uniodized
"
hidden" salt used in processed foods and restaurants.40
Between 50 and 70% of the US population choose iodize salt
for domestic use.11,39 On the average, iodized salt contributes
about 50g iodine/day11 which is substantial considering the
fact that good dietary sources of iodine are few. Despite the
presence of iodine absorption inhibitors, goitrogens and other
antithyroid factors in some plant foods, persons with limited
salt and thus iodine intake may obtain some iodine from root
and leafy vegetables grown on iodine-rich soils, and sea foods
like sea fish and kelp (seaweed) from uncontaminated sources.
Dairy products from animals nurtured on iodine-rich feed
supplements could also be good sources of iodine.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first study that looks at the association between

dietary salt restriction and iodine deficiency in the United
States in an era in which the prevalence of overweight and
obesity has increased with an attendant increase in the preva-
lence of hypertension. In this study, participants were sampled
from all over the United States and were representative of the
US civilian population. Other strengths are that many possi-
ble confounding variables were controlled in this analysis, and
that the analysis was gender stratified.
The limitations of the study include the fact that some cell
sizes were small during the analysis. Thus, generalization of

the results to the entire US population should be made with
caution. Only a few of the normotensive participants were
restricting dietary salt intake. Therefore, the association
between salt restriction and iodine nutritional status could
not be partitioned for only hypertensives. Identification of
dietary salt restriction was based on self-reported data which
is impacted by reporting bias in some cases. However, self-
reported data have been found applicable and reliable in
many studies.2,20,35­37 It is worth noting that, even though the
analysis was based on UIC, a 24-h dietary recall was used for
the estimation of dietary sodium intake. However, a salt con-
sumption survey may give a better assessment of usual dietary

sodium intake. As in many other epidemiological studies, not
all possible confounders, such as use of diuretics, were con-
trolled in this study. The likelihood of women retaining more
iodine and thus excreting less iodine in urine has not been
ascertained. Thus the association between dietary salt restric-
tion and iodine deficiency among women can be due to other
factors other than salt restriction. Despite these limitations,
this study provides substantial evidence that salt restriction
associates with low urinary iodine levels and thus iodine defi-
ciency, especially among individuals who are low on iodine
such as women.
The observation that salt restriction among women asso-
ciated with iodine deficiency has an enormous significance
because the offspring of iodine deficient women are at risk of
IDD, including developmental arrest, neurological damage,
deaf and mutism, decreased mental capacity, and infantile
cretinism.13­15 The outcome of this study implies that the mass
voluntary domestic salt iodization that was necessary for the
prevention of goiter and other IDD in the United States in the
1920's is still relevant today.13,14,17
In summary, dietary salt restriction associated with iodine
deficiency among women but not among men. Alternative
sources of iodine should be suggested to those who need to
cut dietary salt for hypertension and for other health reasons.
Among those iodine deficient, health professionals should
enquire about dietary salt restriction and other dietary behav-
iors that impact iodine nutrition.
