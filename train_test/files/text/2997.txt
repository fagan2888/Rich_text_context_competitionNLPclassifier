HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) IS AN
important risk factor for vas-
cular disease, including
stroke, in the elderly.1,2 Be-
cause vascular disease can lead to de-
mentia,3,4 this suggests a possible asso-
ciation between elevated BP and
increased risk of dementia. However, the
findings of cross-sectional, population-
based studies of BP and cognitive func-
tion in the elderly have varied greatly.
Some studies found higher rates of cog-
nitive impairment associated with el-
evated BP,5 others with low BP,6 and
other studies found little or no associa-
tion.7 These results mirror the conflict-
ing associations between BP and cardio-
vascular disease mortality found in
observational studies of the elderly.8
Interpretation of cross-sectional rela-
tionships between BP and cognitive func-
tion is problematic because dementia it-
self may affect BP through its effects on
diet9 and weight loss.10 Studies of the re-
lationships of midlife BP with late-life
cognitive function assessed at a single
time point, in the Framingham11 and Ho-
nolulu12 heart studies and in an Uppsala
study,13 found higher proportions with
cognitive impairment among those with
elevated BP during midlife. Two small
longitudinal studies found decreased per-
formance on intelligence tests14 or higher
rates of dementia15 associated with el-
evations in diastolic BP at baseline. Two
BP treatment trials reported conflicting
results of antihypertensive treatment on
cognitive test performance.2,16
In the present analysis, we used pro-
spective data to examine whether el-
evated BP predicted level of or change
in cognitive function among persons 65
years or older residing in East Boston,
Mass. More than 2000 of the 3809 East
Boston participants in the Established
Populations for the Epidemiologic Study
of the Elderly (EPESE) project had BP

Context Previous studies raise the possibility that blood pressure (BP) in middle age
predicts later cognitive decline.
Objective To examine prospectively the relationship of BP with level of and change
in cognitive function in the elderly.
Design Longitudinal, population-based study comprising subjects enrolled in the East
Boston component of the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the
Elderly (EPESE) (1982-1983) and the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program
(HDFP) (1973-1974).
Setting East Boston, Mass.
Participants Ofthe3657participantsintheEPESEwithbaselineBPmeasurements,2068
also participated in the HDFP. Subjects were aged 65 to 102 years at baseline in the EPESE
and had mental status and memory assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 years.
Main Outcome Measures Numbers of errors on the Short Portable Mental Status
Questionnaire and the East Boston Memory Test and rates of change in these num-
bers of errors. Subjects had BP measured both at baseline in the EPESE and 9 years
before, as part of the HDFP.
Results In analyses adjusted for age, sex, and education, there was no strong linear
association between BP and cognition. The associations found were fairly small in mag-
nitude, and varied according to which test was used to measure cognition. There was
little evidence for an effect of BP on change in cognitive function with either test, or
for an effect on level of function on the memory test. In analyses of level of mental
status questionnaire performance, however, elevated systolic BP (160 mm Hg) 9 years
before baseline was associated with a 14% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4%-25%)
increase in error rate, relative to the referent (130-139 mm Hg). Baseline systolic BP
had a U-shaped association with the number of errors; error rates were 9% higher
compared with the referent group among those with systolic BP lower than 130 mm
Hg (95% CI, 1%-17%) and 7% greater (95% CI, 0%-15%) among those with el-
evated systolic BP. Diastolic BP 9 years before baseline also had a U-shaped associa-
tion with errors on the mental status questionnaire.
Conclusion The findings do not suggest a linear association of BP with cognitive
decline, but they are consistent with a more complex relationship between BP and cog-
nition than previously appreciated.

measurements 9 years before the begin-
ning of this study as part of the Hyper-
tension Detection and Follow-up Pro-
gram (HDFP). This allowed us to
examine the relationships of both ear-
lier and concurrent BP measurements
with level of and change in cognitive
function.
METHODS
Subjects and Data Collection
In 1982 and 1983, as part of the Na-
tional Institute on Aging's EPESE project,
a census identified 4497 noninstitution-
alized residents, 65 years or older, of East
Boston. A total of 3809 (85%) were in-
terviewed in their homes, either in per-
son or through a proxy. Blood pressure
was measured 3 times at intervals of 30
seconds, while the subject was seated, ac-
cording to the protocol of the HDFP.17
The interviewer also administered a 6-
item memory test (the East Boston
Memory Test18 [EBMT]) and a 9-item ver-
sion of the Pfeiffer Short Portable Men-
tal Status Questionnaire19 (SPMSQ) (the
question, "What is the name of this
place?" was omitted from these home in-
terviews). The SPMSQ has been shown
to be valid and reliable,18,19 and the sen-
sitivity and positive predictive value of
the EBMT in detecting clinically diag-
nosed cognitive impairment are at least
comparable to 2 other commonly used
brief cognitive tests.18,20 For this study,
we restricted analyses to the 3657 par-
ticipantswith baseline BP measures; 3586
of these completed the SPMSQ and 3576
completed the EBMT.
The interviewer also collected infor-
mation about other characteristics po-
tentially related both to BP and cogni-
tive function. Participants were asked
their number of years of formal school-
ing, their present and past use of ciga-
rettes and alcohol, and whether they had
a history of myocardial infarction or
stroke. Angina was identified by the Rose
questionnaire.21 All medications used in
the past 2 weeks were identified by di-
rect inspection.
Nine years before this baseline assess-
ment, 2068 of the study participants had
their BP measured in their homes by the
same protocol, as part of the population-
based screening visit (completed by 89%
of enumerated residents) for the HDFP
clinical trial.17 Because the trial had an
upper age limit, all of these participants
were 81 years or younger at the base-
line EPESE evaluation. Within the age
range of 65 to 81 years, 67% of partici-
pants had BP measurements taken 9 years
previously. We linked data from these
individuals to allow for evaluation of the
relationship of earlier BP measure-
ments with level and change in cogni-
tive function from 9 to 15 years later.
In-home,follow-upinterviewsoccurred
3 and 6 years after baseline and included
the same measures of cognitive function
described above. Of the 3133 surviving
cohort members at the time of the 3-year
follow-up, 2736 completed the SPMSQ
and 2679 completed the EBMT. Of the
2502 participants alive at the time of the
6-year follow-up, 1994 completed the
SPMSQ and 1970 completed the EBMT.
Additionally, 69 participants had miss-
ing data on their number of years of edu-
cation. These individuals were excluded
frommultivariateanalysescontrollingfor
education. Hence, multivariate analyses
of SPMSQ scores at all 3 times included
8235observationsin3588people;com-
parable analyses of memory scores in-
cluded8142observations.Furtherinfor-
mation about demographic characteris-
tics of the population,22 quality control
of BP measurements,23 and participation
in assessment ofcognitivefunction24 has
been published elsewhere.
Statistical Methods
The outcomes of interest were the num-
bers of errors in the SPMSQ and the
EBMT, and changes in these numbers
over time. For both analyses of baseline
BP and BP measured 9 years earlier, we
calculated the systolic and diastolic lev-
els of each subject as the averages of the
3 measurements, respectively. In initial
graphical analyses we explored the re-
lationships of systolic and diastolic BP,
both at baseline and 9 years earlier, with
the baseline numbers of errors on both
tests, using the square roots of these num-
bers to stabilize their variance. These
analyses used robust, local-weighted re-
gression techniques25 to fit smooth curves
without assumptions about the paramet-
ric form of the relationships between BP
and numbers of errors. The graphs sug-
gested that relationships between BP and
cognitive function were nonlinear, with
some elevations in numbers of errors
among those with low or high BP. In sub-
sequent analyses, we classified partici-
pants into 5 groups based on their sys-
tolic BP or 4 groups based on their
diastolic BP. Categories used were the
same as those in a previous analysis of
BP and mortality in this population,8 ex-
cept that those with diastolic BP be-
tween 70 and 79 mm Hg were grouped
in the present analysis. Because of the
possible U-shaped relationships be-
tween BP and cognitive function at base-
line, the reference group for systolic BP
had values between 130 and 139 mm Hg
and for diastolic BP, we chose the group
with values between 70 and 79 mm Hg.
To control for potential confounding
variables and to simultaneously exam-
ine cognitive function scores at all 3
evaluations, we fitted multivariate re-
gression models with a dependent vari-
able of either the number of errors on a
cognitive test or the rate of change in the
square root of this number over time.
When the dependent variable was the
number of errors on a cognitive test at
baseline, 3-year, or 6-year follow-up, we
used a Poisson regression model to re-
late categories of BP to this number. Pa-
rameters in this model are interpreted as
the logarithm of the relative number of
errors comparing individuals in 1 cat-
egory of BP with the referent category.
Also included in the model was a scale
term for overdispersion because errors
were not random among individuals.26
We accounted for the correlation be-
tween the repeated measures of cogni-
tive function in the same persons by us-
ing the generalized estimating equation
approach described by Liang and Zeger.27
We fitted models using SAS statistical
software and made no assumptions about
the values of the intercorrelations be-
tween repeated measures.28 Potentially
confounding variables included in all
models were age (centered at 75 years),
age squared, age cubed (all 3 of these
variables were significantly related to

numbers of errors), education (in years),
sex, and the relative effects of evalua-
tion time (3-year and 6-year follow-up
compared with baseline). To examine the
relationship of BP with change in cog-
nitive function over time, we added in-
teraction terms between BP categories
and time of evaluation (scored as 0 for
baseline, 1 for the 3-year follow-up, and
2 for the 6-year follow-up).
To examine rates of change in num-
bers of errors on cognitive tests we first
obtained a slope for each person, based
on a univariate linear regression, that
described the rate of change over time
in the square root of the number of
errors. Because the distribution of
slopes was skewed and because slopes
were strongly related to baseline scores
on cognitive tests, we used a normal
scores transformation to adjust for
regression to the mean and obtain a
measure of change independent of
baseline score.29 We did this by first
ranking the individual slopes separately
within each level of baseline score. We
then transformed these ranks to the
value, or normal score, that corre-
sponded to the percentile of a normal
distribution with mean 0 and variance
1.30 These normal scores were then
used as dependent variables in multiple
linear regression models that included
the same independent variables as the
Poisson regression models except for
the indicators of evaluation time.
We repeated multivariate analyses
within strata to examine potential modi-
fication of relationships by comorbidity
or use of antihypertensive medications;
another analysis included tobacco and al-
cohol intake. One analysis of people with
diseases potentially affecting cognitive
function was restricted to those who re-
ported at baseline a history of myocar-
dial infarction or stroke, had angina ac-
cording to the Rose questionnaire, or
were using digoxin, loop diuretics, or hy-
poglycemic agents. Another analysis con-
sidered only those with none of these
conditions. We also performed 2 sepa-
rate analyses stratified according to
whether participants were taking anti-
hypertensive medications (1) at base-
line, or (2) at the time of BP assessment
9 years before baseline.
Because nonparticipation in cogni-
tive assessments can be related to actual
cognitive abilities,31 we also fitted sev-
eral models after multiple imputation32
of missing scores on the SPMSQ, based
on several alternative assumptions about
the patterns of missing data. However,
we noted little change in the effects of
BP on cognitive function. Thus, these al-
ternative analyses are not presented.

RESULTS
Unadjusted Baseline Data
Baseline systolic and diastolic BP show
U-shaped associations with baseline
SPMSQ scores with a tendency for more
errors among those with extreme val-
ues of BP (FIGURE 1). However, asso-
ciations of BP 9 years previously with
SPMSQ scores were somewhat differ-
ent and suggested a possible relation-
ship between higher systolic BP and an
increased number of errors.
WhenBPwasrelatedtothesquareroot

(FIGURE2),littleassociationexistedbetween
systolic BP and errors on the EBMT. Low
diastolic BP was possibly associated with
agreaternumberoferrors,althoughinthis
analysispotentiallyconfoundingvariables
were not accounted for.
Several characteristics known to be re-
lated to the risk of lower scores on cog-
nitive tests differed in their distribu-
tions across categories of BP. Participants
with elevated systolic BP tended to be
older and to have less education
(TABLE 1). Conversely, those with low
diastolic BP were older and had less edu-
cation than those with both intermedi-
ate and elevated levels of diastolic BP
(TABLE 2). After adjustment for age and
sex, the prevalence of several condi-
tions that may modify the association be-
tween BP and cognitive function also var-
ied across categories of BP at baseline. A
history of myocardial infarction and use
of digoxin and loop diuretics were more
common among those with low systolic
BP, whereas drug treatment for diabe-
tes and a history of stroke were more
common among those with elevated sys-
tolic BP. Participants with diastolic BP
lower than 70 mm Hg had elevated rates
of self-reported myocardial infarction and
stroke and were more likely to use di-
goxin, loop diuretics, and hypoglyce-
mic drugs, compared with those with
high diastolic BP.
Baseline BP and Cognitive Function
When baseline BP was compared with
the average number of errors on cogni-
tive tests at all 3 times, different associa-
tions were identified for the 2 cognitive
tests (FIGURE 3). Errors on the SPMSQ
during the 6-year follow-up appeared to
have a small U-shaped association with
both systolic and diastolic BP. Com-
pared with the referent group (130-139
mm Hg) for systolic BP (Figure 3), per-
sons with systolic BP lower than 130 mm
Hg had, on average, 9% more errors
(95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-
17%; P = .02) and those at 160 mm Hg
or higher had 7% more errors (95% CI,
0%-15%; P = .05). For diastolic BP (Fig-
ure 3), those at 90 mm Hg or higher av-
eraged 11% more errors (95% CI, 4%-

but the group with low BP had approxi-
mately the same number of errors as the
referent. In contrast, no association ex-
isted between either systolic or dias-
tolic BP (Figure 3) and performance on
the EBMT.
BP 9 Years Before Baseline
and Cognitive Function
When the BPs measured 9 years before
baseline were compared with average
number of errors over the 6 years of fol-
low-up (FIGURE 4), no association was
foundbetweenperformanceontheEBMT
and either systolic or diastolic BP. For the
SPMSQ and systolic BP, we again found
aslightlyincreased error rate among those
with elevated BP; the subgroup with BP
of 160 mm Hg or higher averaged 14%
more errors than the 130 to 139 mm Hg
referent group (95% CI, 4%-25%;
P=.007).FortheSPMSQanddiastolicBP,
the results, as with the baseline BP data,
suggested a small U-shaped relationship.
ThesubgroupwithdiastolicBPlowerthan
70 mm Hg 9 years previously had 12%
more errors (95% CI, 2%-24%; P = .02)
than the 70 to 79 mm Hg referent group,
and those with BP of 90 mm Hg or higher
had 10% more errors (95% CI, 1%-20%;
P = .04).

Subgroup Analyses
We found little evidence that relation-
ships between BP and cognitive func-
tion differed by antihypertensive medi-
cation use, tobacco or alcohol use, or the
presence of potentially modifying dis-
eases. For example, when we ran the
analyses summarized in Figure 3 sepa-
rately among those taking and not tak-
ing antihypertensive medications, those
taking antihypertensive medications with
diastolic BP of 90 mm Hg or higher had
12% more errors in the SPMSQ (P = .03)
than those in the referent group, while
those not taking antihypertensive medi-
cations in the same group had 10% more
errors (P = .03) than the referent. Among
participants without cardiovascular dis-
ease or diabetes, those with diastolic BP
of 90 mm Hg or higher at baseline had
14% more errors (P = .001) relative to
those in the referent category of dias-
tolic BP, while among those with these
diseases, participants with diastolic BP
of 90 mm Hg or higher had 5% more er-
rors (P = .48) than the referent group.
None of the stratified analyses revealed
any substantial associations between BP
and performance on the EBMT.
COMMENT
The analyses presented herein examine
the relationship between BP and cogni-
tive function in several ways. Blood pres-
sure was measured both at the time cog-
nitive testing was done and, for a major
fraction of the cohort, 9 years previ-
ously. Both level of cognitive perfor-
mance and change in performance over
time were examined, and 2 different brief
tests of cognition were used. Overall,
results did not demonstrate a linear as-
sociation between BP and cognition. The
results do, however, raise the possibil-
ity of more complex associations.

These associations were fairly small in
magnitude and varied somewhat accord-
ing to whether level of cognitive func-
tion or change in cognitive function was
assessed and according to which brief test
was used to measure cognition. There
was little evidence for an effect of BP on
change in cognitive function with ei-
ther test; only elevated systolic BP mea-
sured 9 years previously predicted an in-
creasing number of SPMSQ errors in 1
of the analyses of change. For analyses
of BP and level of cognition, the results
varied according to which test was used,
but within each test were reasonably con-
sistent. For SPMSQ performance, per-
sons with elevations either in systolic or
diastolic BP, either at baseline or 9 years
earlier, had consistent and statistically sig-
nificant elevations in error rates com-
pared with those in the referent catego-
ries of BP. Specifically, those with systolic
BP of 160 mm Hg or higher, either at
baseline or 9 years earlier, and those with
diastolic BP of 90 mm Hg or above at ei-
ther time committed between 7% and
14% more errors on the SPMSQ, com-
pared with the referent groups with sys-
tolic BP between 130 and 139 mm Hg
or diastolic BP between 70 and 79
mm Hg, respectively. Furthermore, there
was a suggestion of a U-shaped associa-
tion between performance on this mea-
sure and both systolic BP at baseline and
diastolic BP 9 years previously, because
persons in the lowest BP category also
made more errors than those in the ref-
erent category. In contrast to these re-
sults for the SPMSQ, there was little as-
sociation between BP at either time and
level of performance on the EBMT.
The magnitude of the observed asso-
ciations between low and high levels of
BP and increased error rates on the
SPMSQ can be understood in the con-
text of the observed associations of age
and education with performance on
this test. Both the effects of age and
education were highly significant
(P.001). In the model fitted to the
8235 available SPMSQs, for which the
BP effects are summarized in Figure 3,
the predicted error rate in persons aged
78 years, relative to the referent group
of persons aged 75 years, was 11%
greater. Similarly, relative to partici-
pants with any given educational level,
those with 2 fewer years of education
were predicted to have a 15% greater
error rate. It is also worth noting that in
the entire population both age and
education had similarly strong effects
on error rates on the EBMT, which pro-
vides a frame of reference for the small
observed effects of BP on this measure.
Previous studies have suggested an as-
sociation between lower cognitive func-
tion in late life and elevations in BP mea-
sured some years earlier. In the Longi-
tudinal Population Study of persons aged
70 years in Go
¨teborg, Sweden, the 76 in-
dividuals who were not demented on ex-
amination at age 85 years had signifi-
cantly lower mean systolic and diastolic
BP at age 70 years compared with 18 in-

dividuals who developed dementia be-
tween ages 70 and 85 years.15 In the
Framingham Study, higher levels of both
systolic and diastolic BP measured dur-
ing an interval between 12 and 22 years
before administration of a cognitive test
battery predicted lower scores on the cog-
nitive tests.11 In the Honolulu Heart Pro-
gram, elevated levels of systolic BP 9 to 18
years before administration of the Cogni-
tive Abilities Screening Instrument pre-
dicted poorer performance on this test;
however, diastolic BP had no relation-
ship with performance.12 Conversely, the
recent Uppsala study13 found an associa-
tion between elevated diastolic BP at age
50 years and poorer cognitive perfor-
mance at age 70 years. The first 3 of these
studiesfoundlittleassociationbetweenBP
measured at the time of cognitive assess-
ment and level of cognitive function. This
is consistent with our finding of a sub-
stantial elevation in errors on the SPMSQ
associatedwithelevatedsystolicBP9years
before baseline but an apparent U-
shaped relationship between systolic BP
at baseline and errors.
Strengths of the study include the large
population, with multiple longitudinal
measurements of BP and cognitive per-
formance. Perhaps the greatest limitation
is that measures of cognitive function are
restricted to 2 brief tests. These tests have
been used in previous population stud-
ies of cognition,18-24,29,33 but it is possible
thatmoredetailedtestingofcognitivefunc-
tion would have provided more defini-
tive results. Other limitations include the
absence of BP measurements during the
9 years between the HDFP screening and
the baseline EPESE evaluation, and the
possibility that the HDFP experience led
to more intensive treatment of BP in East
Boston. With regard to the last point, a
comparison between East Boston and 2
other EPESE populations found compa-
rable baseline rates of use of antihyper-
tensive drugs across sites, and slightly
higher mean systolic BP and prevalence of
elevated systolic BP (160 mm Hg) in
East Boston.34
Our prior hypotheses were that higher
BP would be linearly associated with de-
cline in cognitive function over the 6-
year period of cognitive testing, and that
decline would be more strongly pre-
dicted by BP measured 9 years previ-
ously. Overall, our results do not sup-
port these hypotheses, but they do not
unequivocally reject an association be-
tween high BP and cognitive decline. It
is noteworthy that neither set of BP mea-
surements predicted change in cogni-
tive function on either test (except that
systolic BP 160 mm Hg predicted de-
cline in performance on the SPMSQ). In-
dividual change in cognitive test perfor-
mance may be a more meaningful
outcome than level of performance at a
single point in time since education and
cultural factors also influence test per-
formance. Individual change in test per-
formance, on the other hand, is likely to
provide an unbiased measure of cogni-
tion.29 Whether our findings are due to
chance alone or reflect a more complex
relationship between BP and cognition
than previously appreciated remains un-
certain. The relationship of BP to cogni-
tive function continues to deserve de-
tailed investigation because of the great
public health importance of decline in
cognition in later life and the need to
identify potentially modifiable risk fac-
tors for this decline. More definitive ex-
