Intake of Purine-Rich Foods, Protein, and Dairy Products and
Relationship to Serum Levels of Uric Acid
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Hyon K. Choi,1 Simin Liu,2 and Gary Curhan2
Objective. Various commonly consumed foods
have long been suspected of affecting the serum uric
acid level, but few data are available to support or refute
this impression. Our objective was to evaluate the
relationship between dietary factors and serum uric
acid levels in a nationally representative sample of men
and women in the US.
Methods. Using data from 14,809 participants
(6,932 men and 7,877 women) ages 20 years and older in
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (for the years 1988­1994), we examined the
relationship between the intake of purine-rich foods,
protein, and dairy products and serum levels of uric
acid. Diet was assessed with a food-frequency question-
naire. We used multivariate linear regression to adjust
for age, sex, total energy intake, body mass index, use of
diuretics, -blockers, allopurinol, and uricosuric
agents, self-reported hypertension and gout, serum cre-
atinine level, and intake of alcohol.
Results. The serum uric acid level increased with
increasing total meat or seafood intake and decreased
with increasing dairy intake. After adjusting for age, the
differences in uric acid levels between the extreme
quintiles of intake were 0.48 mg/dl for total meat (95%
confidence interval [95% CI] 0.34, 0.61; P < 0.001 for
trend), 0.16 mg/dl for seafood (95% CI 0.06, 0.27; P 
0.005 for trend), and ­0.21 mg/dl for total dairy intake
(95% CI ­0.37, ­0.04; P  0.02 for trend). After adjust-
ing for other covariates, the differences between the
extreme quintiles were attenuated but remained signif-
icant (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). The total protein
intake was not associated with the serum uric acid level
in multivariate analyses (P  0.74 for trend). Those who
consumed milk 1 or more times per day had a lower
serum uric acid level than did those who did not drink
milk (multivariate difference ­0.25 [95% CI ­0.40,
­0.09]; P < 0.001 for trend). Similarly, those who
consumed yogurt at least once every other day had a
lower serum uric acid level than did those who did not
consume yogurt (multivariate difference ­0.26 [95% CI
­0.41, ­0.12]; P < 0.001 for trend).
Conclusion. These findings from a nationally
representative sample of adults in the US suggest that
higher levels of meat and seafood consumption are
associated with higher serum levels of uric acid but that
total protein intake is not. Dairy consumption was
inversely associated with the serum uric acid level.
Hyperuricemia is considered the precursor of
gout, which is the most common form of inflammatory
arthritis in adult men (1). Various commonly consumed
foods have long been suspected of affecting the serum
uric acid levels, but few data are available. For example,
patients with hyperuricemia or gout are typically advised
to avoid habitual intake of purine-rich foods such as
meat and seafood (2,3), but data about the actual
relationship between these foods and serum levels of
uric acid are scarce. Previous metabolic studies used
artificial loading of purified purine (4­7) but did not
elucidate the relationship to actual foods. In particular,
the relationship between total protein intake and serum
uric acid levels remains unclear. Although high-protein
diets tend to contain large quantities of purines, the

uricosuric effect associated with such diets may, in fact,
even lower serum uric acid levels (3,8,9). Furthermore,
limited data suggest that there might be an inverse
relationship between dairy product consumption and
serum uric acid levels (10,11). In a recent large prospec-
tive study of incident gout among men, we found that
higher meat and seafood intake independently increased
the risk of incident gout, while higher dairy intake was
protective against the risk (12). Further, higher protein
intake did not increase the risk (12). The relationship
between these dietary factors and the level of serum uric
acid, however, was not examined in this cohort.
In this study based on the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III), we
evaluated the relationship between the intake of purine-
rich foods, protein, and dairy products and levels of
serum uric acid.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study population. Started in 1988 and completed in
1994, the NHANES-III included a representative sample of
the noninstitutionalized civilian population, which was selected
by using a multistage, stratified sampling design. Persons 60
years of age and older and African American and Mexican
American persons were oversampled. After a home interview,
participants were invited to attend examination sessions where
blood and urine specimens were obtained. For some partici-
pants who were unable to attend the examination because of
health reasons, a blood sample was obtained during the home
interview.
We limited our primary analyses to participants 20
years of age and older who attended the medical examination.
The 14,809 participants (6,932 men and 7,877 women) with
complete information were included in our analyses. In addi-
tion, after excluding participants who self-reported gout or
were taking allopurinol or uricosuric agents (i.e., probenecid
and sulfinpyrazone) (n  446), we repeated our analyses
among the remaining 14,363 participants.
Uric acid measurement. Serum uric acid was measured
by oxidization with the specific enzyme uricase to form allan-
toin and H2
O2
(Hitachi Model 737 Multichannel Analyzer;
Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), as de-
tailed elsewhere (13). Values are reported in milligrams per
deciliter (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 59.48).
Dietary assessment. Dietary assessment was based on
data from a food frequency questionnaire. Food frequency
information was collected during the household interview and
has been shown to be a valid and reliable method for assessing
average consumption (14,15). Respondents were asked how
often over the previous month they had eaten specific food
items. From these data, we calculated the average daily intake
of each food item. The average daily intakes of each item were
then combined to compute the following composite food
groups: total meat (beef, including hamburger, steaks, roast
beef, and meatloaf; pork and ham, including roast pork, pork
chops, and spare ribs; liver and other organ meats, including
heart, kidney, tongue, and tripe; bacon, sausage, and luncheon
meats, such as hot dogs, salami, and bologna; poultry of all
types, including baked or fried chicken nuggets, chicken salad,
and turkey); seafood (fish, including fillets, fish sticks, fish
sandwiches, and tuna; shrimp, clams, oysters, crab, and lob-
ster); and dairy foods (milk; yogurt and frozen yogurt; ice
cream, ice milk, and milkshakes; cheese of all types, including
American, Swiss, cheddar, and cottage cheese). The energy
fraction from protein, fat, and carbohydrates and the total
energy intake were calculated from a 24-hour dietary recall list.
Assessment of covariates. The NHANES-III collected
information on body measurements (including height and

weight), alcohol consumption, medication use (including di-
uretics, antihypertensives, allopurinol, and uricosuric agents),
medical conditions (including self-reported hypertension and
gout), and serum creatinine levels. The body mass index (BMI)
was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the
square of the height in meters.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using survey commands of Stata software (e.g.,
SVYMean and SVYReg) to incorporate sample weights and to
adjust for clusters and strata of the complex sample design
(version 7; Stata, College Station, TX).
We used linear regression to evaluate relationships
between food groups and serum uric acid levels. The average
daily intake for a food group or an individual food item was
categorized into quintiles of intake whenever possible, and
each quintile group of intake was compared with the lowest
quintile group of intake. When a small stratum size of individ-
ual food intake did not allow quintile analysis, we instead used
the following categories, representing mean servings per day:
0, 0.01­0.09, 0.1­0.49, 0.5­0.99, and 1.0. We repeated our
analysis treating food intake (daily servings) as a continuous
variable.
Multivariate models were adjusted for age, sex, total
energy intake, BMI, use of diuretics, -blockers, allopurinol,
and uricosuric agents, self-reported hypertension and gout,
serum creatinine level, and intake of alcohol, total meats,
seafood, and dairy foods. In the multivariate nutrient-density
model for protein intake (16), we simultaneously included
energy intake, the percentages of energy derived from protein
and fat, and other covariates. The coefficients from this model
can be interpreted as the estimated effect of substituting a
specific percentage of energy from protein for the same
percentage of energy from carbohydrates (16). We repeated
these analyses using energy-adjusted protein values (16) in-
stead of nutrient density.
Trends in serum uric acid levels across quintiles of
intake were assessed in linear regression models by using the
median values of each quintile to minimize the influence of
outliers. We also performed logistic regressions with a dichot-
omous variable of hyperuricemia (i.e., serum uric acid 7.0
mg/dl for men and 5.7 mg/dl for women [13]) adjusting for
the same covariates.
We explored potential interactions by sex, BMI (25
kg/m2 versus 25 kg/m2), and alcohol use (abstainer versus
drinker) by testing the significance of interaction terms added
to our final multivariate models. For all difference estimates,
we calculated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). All P values
are 2-sided.
RESULTS
The mean age of the study population was 45
years. The mean serum uric acid level was 5.32 mg/dl

* The average daily intake for individual foods was categorized into quintiles of intake whenever possible (i.e., beef, pork and ham, processed meats,
and poultry). When the small stratum size of individual food intake did not allow quintile analysis (i.e., liver and organ meats, fish, other seafood,
milk, yogurt, and cheese), we used the following categories of mean servings per day: 0, 0.01­0.09, 0.1­0.49, 0.5­0.99, and 1.0. Processed meats
represents bacon, sausage (chorizo), hot dogs, salami, and bologna. Other seafood represents shrimp, clam, crab, lobster, and oyster. Serum uric acid
values are in mg/dl. 95% CI  95% confidence interval.
 Multivariate linear regression models were adjusted for age, sex, total energy intake, body mass index, use of diuretics, -blockers, allopurinol, and
uricosuric agents, self-report of hypertension and gout, serum creatinine level, and alcohol intake. In addition, multivariate differences for individual
meat items were adjusted for seafood and dairy foods, multivariate differences for individual seafood items were adjusted for total meats and dairy
foods, and multivariate differences for individual dairy items were adjusted for total meats and seafood.

(6.07 mg/dl among men and 4.65 mg/dl among women),
and 18% had hyperuricemia (19% among men and 17%
among women). The mean serum uric acid levels were
similar across race/ethnicity categories (i.e., white, Afri-
can American, Mexican American, and other). The
characteristics according to intake of purine-rich food
groups, dairy foods, and total protein are shown in Table
1. With increasing intake of meat, the age tended to
decrease, the proportion of males increased, and daily
alcohol intake slightly increased. Hypertension tended
to be less common with increasing intake of meat and
dairy foods.
The serum uric acid level increased with increas-
ing total meat or seafood intake (Table 2). After adjust-
ing for age, the serum uric acid level in the highest
quintile group of total meat intake was higher than that
in the lowest quintile by 0.48 mg/dl (95% CI 0.34, 0.61;
P  0.001 for trend). The corresponding difference for
seafood was 0.16 mg/dl and (95% CI 0.06, 0.27; P 
0.005 for trend). After adjusting for other covariates,
these differences between the extreme quintiles were
attenuated but remained significant (P  0.05 for both
comparisons) (Table 2).
In the age-adjusted analysis for individual meat
items, the differences in serum uric acid levels between
the extreme quintiles of intake were 0.45 mg/dl (95% CI
0.33, 0.56) for beef, 0.27 mg/dl (95% CI 0.18, 0.35) for
pork, and 0.48 mg/dl (95% CI 0.34, 0.61) for processed
meats. These magnitudes were attenuated, but remained
significant, after multivariate adjustment (Table 3). Sim-
ilarly, higher intake of individual seafood items was
associated with higher level of serum uric acid (Table 3).
After adjusting for age, the serum uric acid level
in the highest quintile group of total dairy food intake
was lower than that in the lowest by 0.21 mg/dl (95% CI
0.04, 0.37; P  0.02 for trend). After adjusting for other
covariates, the difference between the extreme quintiles
remained similar (P  0.005 for trend) (Table 2). Those
who consumed milk 1 time per day had a lower serum
uric acid level than did those who did not drink milk
(multivariate difference ­0.25 [95% CI ­0.40, ­0.09];
P  0.001 for trend) (Table 3). Similarly, those who
consumed yogurt at least once every other day had a
lower uric acid level than did those who did not consume
yogurt (multivariate difference 0.26 [95% CI 0.41,
0.12]; P  0.001 for trend).
The results of logistic regressions with hyperuri-
cemia as a dichotomous outcome were similar. For
example, the multivariate odds ratio (OR) for hyperuri-
cemia among those in the highest quintile group of meat
intake as compared with those in the lowest quintile was
1.37 (95% CI 1.05, 1.80; P  0.027 for trend) and the
corresponding OR for dairy intake was 0.74 (95% CI
0.55, 0.99; P  0.05 for trend). The multivariate ORs for
hyperuricemia were 1.58 (95% CI 1.07, 2.34; P  0.11
for trend) for fish consumption between more than a
half daily serving and none, and 0.66 (95% CI 0.48, 0.89;
P  0.011 for trend) for milk consumption between 1
daily serving and none.
The serum uric acid level increased with increas-
ing protein intake in the age-adjusted analysis (P 
0.006 for trend). However, after adjusting for other
covariates, total protein intake was no longer associated
with the serum uric acid level (Table 2). When we
repeated the analysis using energy-adjusted protein val-
ues (16) instead of the percentage of energy, the results
did not materially change (P  0.72 for trend).
When we repeated our analyses for foods or
protein after excluding participants who self-reported
gout or were taking allopurinol or uricosuric agents, the
results did not materially change. There were no signif-
icant interactions between total meat or seafood intake
and sex, BMI, or alcohol use (P  0.27 for interaction
for all comparisons). The serum uric acid level in the
highest quintile group of dairy food intake was lower
than that in the lowest quintile by 0.14 mg/dl (95% CI
0.03, 0.25) among those with a BMI 25 kg/m2 and by
0.30 mg/dl (95% CI 0.13, 0.47) among those with a BMI
25 kg/m2 (P  0.13 for interaction).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative sample of men
and women, the serum uric acid level was found to
significantly increase with increasing consumption of
meat and seafood but not with total protein intake. In
addition, we found a significant inverse association with
dairy consumption. These associations were indepen-
dent of both the other dietary factors we studied and the
other risk factors for hyperuricemia, such as age, sex,
BMI, serum creatinine level, hypertension, alcohol use,
and diuretic use.
The current study findings suggest that the con-
sumption of meat and seafood in amounts reflective of
the nationwide intake increases serum levels of uric acid.
Previously, the link has been primarily extrapolated from
animal or human metabolic experiments that examined
the impact of short-term artificial loading of purified
purine (rather than actual food items) on the serum uric
acid level (4­7). However, the precise identity and
quantity of individual purines in most foods are not
well-known, especially when cooked or processed (8),

and the bioavailability of various purines contained in
different foods varies substantially. For example, dietary
substitution/addition experiments showed that RNA has
a greater effect on the serum uric acid level than does an
equivalent amount of DNA (7), ribomononucleotides
greater than nucleic acid (17), and adenine greater than
guanine (4). Thus, it has been difficult to predict
whether a commonly consumed food or food group
actually affects the serum uric acid level, and if so, then
by how much. The current study directly linked common
foods and serum uric acid levels and provides the
relevant information.
We found a significant inverse relationship be-
tween dairy consumption and serum uric acid levels,
which is consistent with previous reports (10,11). Inges-
tion of milk proteins (casein and lactalbumin) has been
shown to decrease serum uric acid levels in healthy
subjects via the uricosuric effect of these proteins (11).
Conversely, in a 4-week randomized clinical trial, it was
shown that a significant increase in serum uric acid levels
was induced by consumption of a dairy-free diet (11).
Since dairy products are low in purine content, dairy
protein may exert its urate-lowering effect without hav-
ing the concomitant purine load contained in other
protein sources, such as meat and seafood.
The total protein intake was not associated with
the uric acid level. Protein-rich foods have been gener-
ally perceived as surrogates for purine-rich foods, and
patients with gout and hyperuricemia have been tradi-
tionally advised to reduce their protein intake. While we
are not aware of any direct evidence that ingested
proteins per se cause hyperuricemia, there are reports
that suggest the contrary (8,9,18). High-protein diets are
associated with increased urinary excretion of uric acid
and may lower serum levels of uric acid (8,9,18). A small
retrospective case­control study showed that protein
consumption was slightly lower in gout patients than
controls, although the difference was not statistically
significant (8). Overall, our findings are consistent with
these previous studies. These data collectively suggest
that protein per se does not increase uric acid levels and
that the protein content of foods may not be a correct
surrogate for purine content.
Strengths and limitations of our study deserve
comment. This study was performed in a nationally
representative sample of women and men in the US;
thus, the findings are likely to be generalizable to men
and women in the US. A cross-sectional study design, as
opposed to cohort studies, tends to leave uncertainty
regarding the temporal sequence of exposure­outcome
relationships and is also vulnerable to recall bias. If some
participants reduced their intake of meat or seafood
based on previously identified hyperuricemia, it would
lead to an underestimation of the association between
dietary intake and serum uric acid level, making our
findings conservative. In the NHANES-III, the health
examination component that included serum uric acid
measurement (outcome) was performed after the house-
hold interview that inquired about dietary intake during
the previous month (exposure). Thus, it appears implau-
sible that the serum uric acid levels measured in this
study would somehow systematically influence the re-
ported intake of these factors. Our main analysis in-
cluded those with self-reported gout and those who were
taking medications to treat hyperuricemia. Thus, if these
participants reduced their intake of meat or seafood
based on their diagnosis of gout or hyperuricemia re-
quiring treatment, it would theoretically lead to an
underestimation of the association between these foods
and the serum uric acid level. However, exclusion of
these participants did not materially affect our results.
This is likely due to the low proportion of participants
with these characteristics (3%) or is potentially due to an
insubstantial change in diet after their diagnosis of gout
or hyperuricemia requiring treatment.
In conclusion, our results suggest that higher
levels of meat and seafood consumption are associated
with higher levels of serum uric acid, but the total
protein intake is not. Dairy consumption was inversely
associated with the uric acid level.
