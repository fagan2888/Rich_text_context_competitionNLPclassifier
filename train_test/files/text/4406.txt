Introduction
In "Are coups good for democracy?" (Derpanopoulos et al.,
2016), we look at the political consequences of coups in
autocracies. We find that, though democracies are some-
times established in the wake of coups, more often new
authoritarian regimes emerge. Further, we show that coups
frequently increase state-led violence, particularly follow-
ing coups that lead to new autocratic regimes.
In a recent critique of our study, Miller (2016) chal-
lenges one particular finding: that coups rarely lead to
democratization. He argues that our use of a regime-case
fixed-effects (FE) model to estimate the impact of coups on
the likelihood of transitions to democracy drops a number
of key observations from the sample, biasing our estimates.
He emphasizes that when a country FE model is used
instead, there is a positive relationship.
In our original analysis, we find that there is no asso-
ciation between post-Cold War coups and democratiza-
tion in a regime-case FE model, but show in the online
appendix to our published results (Figure A-2) that there
is a positive association between post-Cold War coups and
democratic transition when using a country FE model.1
Miller (2016) re-reports and expands on the country FE
model of democratic transitions that we report in the
appendix to our original analysis. In fact, the conclusions
of Miller (2016) are identical to those drawn from one set
of tests we report in the original appendix. We thank the
editors of Research and Politics, however, for allowing
us to further the discussion of the points articulated in
Miller (2016).
In the analysis that follows, we first offer background on
the key issues that underlie Miller's critique. We then re-
state Miller's critique in a slightly different way and
demonstrate visually the differences between regime-case
and country FE models in this application. In doing so, we
focus on the post-Cold War period because Miller's only
point of disagreement about the consequences of coups
pertains to the relationship between post-1989 coups and
democratic transition.

Abstract
This article responds to "Reanalysis: Are coups good for democracy?" (Miller MK (2016) Reanalysis: Are coups good
for democracy? Research and Politics 3(4): ) We make clear to readers that Miller (2016) re-reports findings that we
originally reported in the Appendix to our original article. We then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different
estimators and re-state Miller's main point with a visual presentation of how regime-case and country fixed effects
estimators differ in this application.

transition. Yet, all modeling choices have advantages and
disadvantages, and the "optimal" approach is up to scholars
to assess. It is for this reason that we presented the results
of both in our study (the regime-case FE model in the main
text and the country FE model in the appendix). Here, how-
ever, we provide a more in-depth discussion of the logic
underlying both approaches and their strengths and draw-
backs in light of the Miller (2016) critique.
A FE estimator isolates the over-time variation in the
data, allowing inferences that are not contaminated by
unobserved unit (or cross-sectional) heterogeneity. When
estimating FE models, researchers must determine the
cross-sectional unit over which to isolate the time trends. In
our original paper, we reported results from two sets of
models that make different assumptions about the appropri-
ate cross-sectional unit: the country and the regime-case.
A country FE model isolates variation over time within
countries; that is, it uses information about movement over
time in the independent and dependent variables to identify
the estimated parameter of interest (in this application, the
marginal effect of a recent coup on the probability of transi-
tion to a new autocratic regime or to democracy). This
approach accounts for time-invariant heterogeneity across
countries, such as colonial history and geographic endow-
ments. When a country contains more than one autocratic
regime ­ for example in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), Guinea, or Thailand ­ a country FE estimator com-
pares periods of no recent coup with periods of recent coup
within the same country to inform an estimate of how
recent coups influence regime instability.
In this application, a regime-case represents a continu-
ous spell of years under the rule of a single autocratic
regime. In some instances, regime-cases are preceded and
succeeded by periods of democratic rule. For example,
coups in Thailand upended democracy in 1991, 2006, and
2014, each time ushering in a new autocratic regime. In
other instances, we see successive autocratic regime-cases
during the period of analysis. Examples include the DRC
(former Zaire), where a rebellion led by Laurent Kabila
toppled the long-standing Mobutu regime in 1997, and
Guinea, where a junior officer coup led by Dadis Camara
ousted the Conté regime in 2008.
A regime-case FE model therefore enables a within-
regime comparison of what follows a coup, while condi-
tioning out all differences between autocratic regimes
(e.g. level of development, how the regime seized power,
the types of leaders the regime selects to rule). Thus,
periods of no recent coup are compared with periods of
recent coup within the same regime-case. Critically, this
approach takes into account autocratic regime type, such
as whether the incumbent regime is ruled by the military.
This is crucial because of strong empirical evidence that
coups are more frequent in military dictatorships and
that military dictatorships are more likely, all else equal,
to democratize (Geddes et al., 2014).
Employing a regime-case fixed effects estimator implies
that: (1) the baseline likelihood of a democratic transition
and coup varies by the regime as well as by country; and (2)
short-lived regimes may not have sufficient variation in the
key explanatory variable (recent coup) to inform the esti-
mated parameter of interest. In this application, the latter
feature of the regime-case fixed effect estimator has the
effect, as Miller (2016: 2) notes, of "effectively remov[ing]
most recent coups from the sample." While Miller focuses
on the fact that the regime-case FE estimator drops some
cases where the short-lived autocratic regime is always in a
state of having had a recent coup, the substantive benefit of
this design choice is that the baseline likelihoods of democ-
ratization and coups are not constrained to be the same for
all regimes within the same country.2
The issue that Miller raises regarding the bias of the
regime-case FE modeling approach is largely not present
when employing a country FE estimator in this application
because, when there are multiple regimes within the post-
Cold War period, at least one of them has a period where
the recent coup indicator is equal to 0.3 There are, therefore,
trade-offs in choosing between regime-case FE and country
FE estimators. Our published analysis included both types
of tests for interested readers to compare the differing
results for democratic transition.
Re-stating the Miller (2016) critique
One way to summarize the Miller (2016) critique is as fol-
lows: in some short-lived autocracies, the main explanatory
variable (recent coup) does not vary over time within the
regime-case. For example, if a coup occurs in time t - 2
but the regime only lasts one year, then recent coup will
have a value of 1 for the entire period of regime rule. A
regime-case FE estimator does not draw support from these
cases to estimate the parameter of interest because it iso-
lates the "within" variation, and these regimes have no
"within-case" variation in the recent coup indicator.
Consider a second way to illustrate the same point in a
model specification that separates the "within" and
"between" variation in the explanatory variables4

In this equation, Xi
is the mean value of the main explanatory
variable and i can be either the country or the regime-case.
Thus X X
i t i
,
- is the deviation from the unit mean (i.e. the
"within" variation) and Xi
is the unit mean (i.e. the "between"
variation). In our application, the parameter of interest is 
1
,
which is the estimate of the marginal effect of recent coup
( X X
i t i
,
- ) on the probability of democratic transition.
The concern that Miller raises with respect to fixed
effects models can be illustrated by noting that, for cases in
Derpanopoulos et al. 3
which there is no "within" variation ­ those where the
regime is always in a state of recent coup ­ the mean level
of coups, Xi
is 1. Thus Xi t
,
=1 for all t and Xi
=1, while
X X
i t i
,
- =0 in these cases.
Note that, if there is more than one autocratic regime per
country, then Xiregime
is not necessarily equal to Xicountry
.
Thus while the regime-case mean for recent coup may be 1,
the country mean for the same variable may be less than 1.5
Figure 1 shows the distribution of regime-case Xi
s and
country Xi
s for the post-1989 sample. The left plot shows
the entire sample, while the right plot shows only regimes
with at least one successful coup during this period. The
gray bars represent the regime-case Xi
s for recent coup,
while the un-shaded bars with blue outlines represent the
country Xi
s for recent coup. The right plot shows that there
are substantially more regime-case Xi
s equal to 1 than
country Xi
s. The regimes where the regime-case Xi
s equal
1 are effectively dropped from the estimating sample for
lack of within-case variation in the recent coup indicator.
Table 1 lists the 16 cases of short-lived autocratic
regimes where the regime-case mean for recent coup is
always equal to 1. Half of these cases, or eight in total,
democratize after the regime collapses. Miller's argument
is that the regime-case fixed effects model does not draw
support from these sixteen cases to estimate the main
parameter of interest. While we agree with Miller's larger
point that regime-case FE in this application effectively
remove short-lived regimes from the analysis, we note that
many of these short-lived dictatorships dropped from the
analysis are coded as dictatorships precisely because a
recent coup toppled an incumbent democracy. The cases
highlighted in gray are those in which the historical coup
event that makes the indicator of recent coup equal to 1 is a
coup that ended a democracy. One practical effect of using
a regime-case estimator that does not draw support from
short-lived autocracies is that this approach does not count
the "democratic reversal" coups in Table 1 as potential can-
didates for coups that enhance democracy.
More to Miller's point, there are four cases where recent
coups in short-lived dictatorships are followed by demo-
cratic transition: Egypt 2011, Guinea-Bissau 2002, Haiti
1988, and Niger 2010. In a regime-case FE model, these
cases do not inform the estimate of interest; however, in a
country FE model they are included because the country
Xi
is less than 1. Thus the key difference, in this applica-
tion, between a regime-case FE estimator and a country FE
estimator, is that the latter allows those four `positive'cases
to inform the estimate of interest.
Remarks
We acknowledge that there are trade-offs in choosing
between different estimators (regime-case FE and country
FE in this application). In our original analysis, we reported
the results from both FE estimators for both of our depend-
ent variables: transition to democracy and transition to new
autocracy. Results from both FE estimators yielded consist-
ent results for coups and transitions to new autocratic
regimes. This gives us confidence that these results are not
dependent on the choice of cross-sectional `unit'. The tests
for transitions to democracy, however, were mixed.
The larger point of our original study and the main point
we emphasize here is that coups in dictatorships increase the
risk of a new autocracy taking power; indeed, most coups in
dictatorships are followed by new autocratic regimes. This
finding is not dependent on the time period under analysis
(1950­1989 vs. 1990­2015). The (average) positive correla-
tion between post-1989 coups and democratic transition is
less robust than prior studies have suggested, as we showed in
our replication of Thyne and Powell (2016).

4 Research and Politics 
We do not anticipate that our analysis will be the last
word on this issue because our results ­ and all results using
less than 30 years of data (post 1989) ­ are based on only a
handful of instances when coups in dictatorships coincide
with subsequent democratic transition.As more coups occur
in the real world, additional data may alter our conclusions.
Therefore, we urge policy-makers to digest evidence
for the "good coup" hypothesis with some skepticism. We
also encourage researchers to dig deeper in terms of better
understanding why some post-Cold War coups precipitate
transitions to democracy, while other coups simply unleash
new forms of authoritarianism, often accompanied by
increased state-led violence (Derpanopoulos et al., 2016).
Gaining a more solid grasp of why it is that coups can lead
to such disparate outcomes seems like an important step
for moving forward.

Notes
1. As readers may know, Research and Politics has a strict, low
word count of 4000 words. This necessitates putting some of
the discussion of robustness tests in an online appendix.
2. The issue that Miller underlines also arises when estimating the
relationship between coups and autocratic transition. For exam-
ple, half (10 out of 20) of the cases in which the coup variable
coincides with autocratic transition during the post-1989 period
are in a state of recent coup during their entire (short) duration
and therefore do not inform the estimates. Thus, the models
with regime-case FE reported in the main text of our original
study are difficult tests of the hypothesis because the estimates
from these models do not draw support from these short-lived
regimes. In contrast to democratic transitions, the findings for
autocratic transitions are robust to this difficult test.
3. The one exception is Thailand.
4. This equation is analytically equivalent to one that includes
the non-demeaned variables as well as the mean variables as
covariates. The estimates for 1
in equation (1) are the same
as those in a model that includes Xi t
,
+ Xi
as covariates.
5. In the estimating sample, there are three observations ­ all
for Thailand ­ for which the country Xi is equal to 1. This
occurs because all-post 1989 autocratic years in Thailand are
short-lived regimes (1991­1992, 2006­2007, 2014­NA).
