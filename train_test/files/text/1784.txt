OBJECTIVE -- The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased among U.S. adults
from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004. We sought to explore the importance of trends in risk factors
for CKD over time
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The prevalence of cigarette smoking, obe-
sity, hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes among U.S. adults with stage 3 CKD (estimated
glomerular filtration rate 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-
creatinine ratio 30 mg/g), separately, were determined for 1988­1994 and 1999­2004 using
data from serial National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The prevalence ratios (PRs)
for stage 3 CKD and albuminuria by the presence of these risk factors were compared across
survey periods.
RESULTS -- The PR for CKD declined between 1988­1994 and 1999­2004 for obesity (PR
1.51 and 1.14 for 1988­1994 and 1999­2004, respectively; P for change  0.010), hyperten-
sion (PR 2.60 and 1.70; P for change  0.005), and high cholesterol (PR 1.58 and 1.20; P for
change  0.028). However, for diagnosed diabetes, the PR remained unchanged (1.64 and 1.62;
P for change  0.898). Similar results were observed for undiagnosed diabetes (PR of CKD 1.38
and 1.50; P for change  0.373). The association of cigarette smoking was similar in each time
period. Besides obesity, for which the association remained stable over time, similar patterns
were observed for the PR of albuminuria.
CONCLUSIONS -- In terms of CKD, improvements in hypertension and high cholesterol
management have been offset by both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. Further increases in
CKD may occur if diabetes continues to increase.
Diabetes Care 31:1337­1342, 2008
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a
common condition, affecting a sub-
stantial proportion of adults in the
U.S. and worldwide (1). A recent analysis
documented a marked increase in CKD
prevalence among U.S. adults over the
past decade (2). Due to its impact on qual-
ity of life, cardiovascular disease (CVD)
incidence, and mortality, CKD is an im-
portant public health challenge (3­5).
Obesity, smoking, hypertension,
high cholesterol, and diabetes are key risk
factors for CKD (6­9). Awareness, treat-
ment, and control of hypertension has im-
proved over the past several decades
(10,11). Significant reductions in mean
cholesterol levels have occurred as well
(12), likely due to dietary changes and
increasing usage of cholesterol-lowering
medications. However, the prevalence
and incidence of diabetes continue to in-
crease (13­16), fueled by marked in-
creases in obesity (17).
We hypothesized that CKD related to
hypertension and high cholesterol has de-
creased over time, likely due to improve-
ments in the management of these
conditions. However, given an ongoing
increase in the prevalence of diabetes
without significant improvements in its
treatment (18), we further hypothesized
that CKD related to diabetes has in-
creased. We tested these hypotheses by
assessing trends in the association of cig-
arette smoking, obesity, hypertension,
high cholesterol, and diabetes with CKD
and albuminuria between 1988­1994
and 1999­2004 using data from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) III and
NHANES 1999­2004.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Study sample
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004
are cross-sectional nationally representa-
tive surveys of the noninstitutionalized ci-
vilian population of the U.S. Briefly, each
survey employs a multistage stratified
probability sample based on selection of
counties, blocks, households, and per-
sons within households. Mexican-
Americans, non-Hispanic blacks, and
older adults were oversampled in order to
improve the estimate precision for these
groups. Each NHANES consisted of an in-
home interview and medical evaluation
and a blood sample collection in a mobile
examination center. In NHANES III and
NHANES 1999 ­2004, 18,825 and
15,332 participants, respectively, com-
pleted the medical evaluation and study
interview. Exclusions for the current
study included those without serum cre-
atinine measurements, estimated glomer-
ular filtration rate (GFR) 30 ml/min per
1.73 m2, and women pregnant at the ex-
amination, resulting in 15,502 and
12,453 participants from NHANES III
and NHANES 1999­2004, respectively,
available for analysis of stage 3 CKD. For
the analysis of albuminuria, individuals

measurements and pregnant or menstru-
ating women were excluded, resulting in
valid data from 15,216 and 12,778 par-
ticipants from NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2004, respectively.
Covariate data
Of relevance to the current analysis, vari-
ables collected during the in-home inter-
view were age, race/ethnicity, sex,
cigarette smoking, a history of diabetes,
and pharmacologic treatment for hyper-
tension, high cholesterol, or diabetes. Par-
ticipants who reported having smoked
100 cigarettes during their lifetime
were classified as current or former smok-
ers if they answered affirmatively or neg-
atively, respectively, to the question "Do
you now smoke cigarettes?" A fixed stadi-
ometer was used to measure height; a To-
ledo digital scale was used to measure
weight with participants clothed in un-
derwear, a disposable gown, and foam
slippers. BMI was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height
in meters; obesity was defined as BMI
30 kg/m2.
Three blood pressure measurements
were obtained using a standard protocol
(American Heart Association) during the
evaluation. While three additional blood
pressure measurements were taken dur-
ing the NHANES III in-home interview,
for comparability, the current analyses
were limited to blood pressure measure-
ments from the medical evaluation. Using
the mean of all available blood pressure
measurements, systolic and/or diastolic
blood pressure 140 mmHg and/or 90
mmHg, respectively, or current use of
blood pressure­lowering medication was
used to define hypertension.
Laboratory measurements and
exposure definitions
Blood samples were stored at 20°C. For
lipid analyses, samples were shipped to
the Lipoprotein Analytical Laboratory
(Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
MD). Total cholesterol was measured
with the Hitachi 704 Analyzer; high cho-
lesterol was defined as levels 240 mg/dl
or concurrent pharmacologic lipid-
lowering treatment.
Glucose was measured on previously
frozen plasma at the University of Mis-
souri at Columbia. Self-report of a prior
diagnosis of diabetes with current use of
an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin was
used to define diagnosed diabetes. For
participants without diagnosed diabetes
who attended a morning NHANES study
visit after fasting 8 h or longer (n  7,329
and 5,572 for NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2004, respectively), undiagnosed
diabetes was defined as plasma glucose
126 mg/dl.
Outcome definitions
Serum creatinine was measured using the
modified kinetic method of Jaffe (Hitachi
917 analyzer). Serum creatinine concen-
trations were calibrated to the assays used
for the development of the modification
of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation
(19). GFR was estimated with the simpli-
fied MDRD equation. Individuals with an
estimated GFR (eGFR) of 30­59 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 were considered to have stage
3 CKD.
Urine albumin and creatinine con-
centrations were measured in the same
laboratory during both surveys. Urinary
albumin was measured using a solid-
phase fluorescence immunoassay; uri-
nary creatinine was measured using
modified kinetic method of Jaffe (Astra
Analyzer; Beckman Coulter Synchron).
Albuminuria was defined as a urinary al-
bumin­to­urinary creatinine ratio 30

mg/g. The protocols for NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2004 were approved by
the National Center for Health Statistics of
the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention Institutional Review Board.
Statistical methods
Characteristics of the populations with
and without stage 3 CKD and with and
without albuminuria were calculated for
each time period. Characteristics in-
cluded age, race/ethnicity, sex, mean lev-
els of systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, BMI, total cholesterol, glycated
hemoglobin, use of blood pressure­ and
cholesterol-lowering medications, and
prevalence of cigarette smoking, obesity,
hypertension, high cholesterol, and diag-
nosed and undiagnosed diabetes. The sta-
tistical significance of differences in the
means and prevalence estimates across
the two surveys was determined using the
Wald 2 test. Test statistics were calcu-
lated as the difference in prevalence esti-
mates divided by the standard error of the
difference, calculated as the square root of
the sum of each estimate's variance. The
prevalence ratios (PRs) of stage 3 CKD
and albuminuria associated with cigarette
smoking, obesity, hypertension, high
cholesterol, and diagnosed and undiag-
nosed diabetes were estimated for each
time period, separately, using log-
binomial regression models including ad-
justment for age, race, sex, hypertension,
and self-reported diabetes. The statistical
significance of changes in the PRs over
time was calculated using two sample t
tests (i.e., the difference in the -coeffi-
cients from the regression models divided
by the square root of the sum of their
variance).
Sample weights that account for the
complex survey design of NHANES, in-
cluding unequal probabilities of selec-
tion, over-sampling, and nonresponse,
were applied for all analyses using
SUDAAN (Version 9.1; Research Trian-
gle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC). Standard errors were estimated
using the Taylor series linearization
method.
RESULTS
Demographic and risk factors among
individuals with and without stage 3
CKD
Demographic characteristics, risk factor
levels, and the prevalence of risk factors
among individuals with and without stage
3 CKD in the two time periods are shown
in Table 1. Among individuals with stage
3 CKD, the prevalence of cigarette smok-
ing declined and obesity, hypertension,
and high cholesterol remained stable.
However, the prevalence of diagnosed di-
abetes increased (13.0 and 16.8% for
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004,
respectively), although this did not reach
statistical significance (P  0.093).
Among individuals without CKD, the
prevalence of obesity, hypertension, high
cholesterol, and diagnosed diabetes in-
creased, whereas the prevalence of undi-
agnosed diabetes was stable.
The PR for CKD associated with cig-
arette smoking was similar in both time
periods, while the PR for CKD associated
with obesity, hypertension, and high cho-
lesterol was significantly lower in 1999­
2004 compared with 1988­1994 (Fig.
1). For example, the PR for CKD associ-
ated with hypertension was 2.60 (95% CI
2.00­3.38) in NHANES III and decreased
to 1.70 (1.43­2.02) in NHANES 1999­
2004 (P for change  0.005). However,
for CKD associated with diagnosed diabe-
tes, the PR remained unchanged (1.64 in
NHANES III and 1.62 in NHANES 1999­
2004; P for change  0.898). Similar re-
sults were observed for undiagnosed
diabetes: the PR for CKD was 1.38 and
1.50 in NHANES III and NHANES 1999­
2004, respectively; P for change 
0.373).
Risk factors among individuals with
and without albuminuria
Among individuals with albuminuria, the
prevalence of cigarette smoking de-
creased between 1988­1994 and 1999­
2004. The prevalence of hypertension,
high cholesterol, and undiagnosed diabe-
tes remained stable, whereas the preva-
lence of obesity and diagnosed diabetes
increased (Table 2). The PRs for albumin-
uria associated with cigarette smoking
and obesity was similar for 1988­1994
and 1999­2004 (Fig. 2). However, the
PRs for albuminuria associated with hy-
pertension and high cholesterol de-
creased over the time period under study
(P  0.024 and 0.020, respectively). The
PR for albuminuria associated with diag-

nosed diabetes decreased from 3.28 to
2.69 (P  0.079), whereas the PR for al-
buminuria associated with undiagnosed
diabetes increased nonsignificantly P 
0.594).
Self-reported diabetes
In a secondary analysis, diagnosed diabe-
tes was redefined to include participants
who self-reported diabetes regardless of
whether they were on medication. Using
this definition, the prevalence of diabetes
increased between 1988 ­1994 and
1999­2004 from 16.0 to 19.1% among
those with CKD and from 4.9 to 6.2%
among adults without CKD. Also, the
prevalence of diabetes increased from
21.4 to 24.1% and from 3.9 to 5.3%
among adults with and without albumin-
uria, respectively. Similar to the main re-
sults, the PRs of CKD and albuminuria
associated with self-reported diabetes did
not change significantly over time (each
P  0.30; data not shown).
CONCLUSIONS
Principal findings
The current study suggests that the asso-
ciation of obesity, hypertension, and high
cholesterol with CKD has declined over
time. Conversely, we observed no change
in the association between diabetes and
CKD. With the exception of obesity, for
which the association with albuminuria
did not change over time, similar trend
results were observed for albuminuria.
In the present study, we demonstrate
significant declines in the PRs for CKD
associated with obesity, hypertension,
and high cholesterol, suggesting that im-
provements have been made in terms of
risk factor management. However, we ob-
served no change in the PR of CKD due to
diabetes over time. These findings suggest
that similar improvements for diabetes
management have not occurred. The as-
sociation between obesity and CKD de-
clined over the time period under study.
National trends data have demonstrated
improvements in blood pressure and lipid
values across categories of BMI over time
(20). Therefore, despite increasing rates
of obesity, improved risk factor manage-
ment may partially account for the
present findings.
In the context of the current
literature
Diabetes is a critical risk factor for CKD
and albuminuria (6,21,22) and accounts
for nearly half of all incident cases of end-
stage renal disease in the U.S. (8). Numer-
ous studies have shown that the
prevalence and incidence of diabetes con-
tinue to increase (13­16). The increase in
number of U.S. adults with diabetes has
lead to an increase in the attributable risk
for diabetes as a CVD risk factor relative to
other traditional risk factors (23). Rates of
treatment and control of CVD risk factors
among people with diabetes remains poor
(18). Although U.S. vital statistics docu-
ment a marked decline in cardiovascular
mortality over the past several decades,
recent data suggest that individuals with
diabetes have not experienced the same
mortality reductions (24). We extend
these findings to relations between diabe-
tes and CKD and show that the PR for
CKD did not decline over the past decade.
In contrast, results for hypertension
and high cholesterol are more encour-
aging. While hypertension has in-
creased among U.S. adults over the past
decade (11), rates of hypertension treat-
ment and control have also increased.
The improvement in overall manage-
ment of hypertension, despite its in-
creasing prevalence, is reflected in the
reduced PR for hypertension as a CKD
risk factor. Rates of high cholesterol
have decreased over time (12). Dietary

Trends in CKD risk factors
1340 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 31, NUMBER 7, JULY 2008
improvements are likely partially re-
sponsible for these trends as well. Sim-
ilar to the results for hypertension, our
results indicate that an added benefit of
these interventions may be the reduced
risk of CKD and albuminuria associated
with high cholesterol.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of the current study include the
well-characterized NHANES datasets,
large sample size, and nationally repre-
sentative data. We were able to examine
CKD as defined by reduced eGFR as well
as albuminuria, a well-established risk
factor for CKD (25,26). Further, albu-
minuria identifies different subsets of in-
dividuals at risk for CVD and all-cause
mortality as compared with CKD alone
(27). Limitations include the use of the
MDRD equation to estimate GFR instead
of a direct measurement (28), which
would not be feasible in a large popula-
tion-based study. Further, the MDRD
equation underestimates eGFR in healthy
individuals (29); how this impacts the di-
chotomous classification of CKD is uncer-
tain. We used a study design that
incorporated serial cross-sectional studies
and therefore cannot infer causality be-
tween risk factors and CKD. However, we
believe that this study design is the most
powerful for determining overall trends
in disease burden. Our sample was lim-
ited to individuals with stage 3 CKD due
to small numbers of individuals with
more severe CKD. Measures of albumin-
uria were based on a spot-urine collec-
tion. However, the correlation between
24-h collections and spot urine is accept-
able (30). We relied on fasting plasma
glucose and not an oral glucose tolerance
test to define diabetes. Therefore, we may
have underestimated the prevalence of
undiagnosed diabetes in our sample.
However, it is unlikely that this occurred
differentially between NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2004. Therefore, this is
unlikely to account for the observed
findings.
Implications
Increases in obesity have lead to rises in
the prevalence of diabetes. As diabetes
continues to increase, the prevalence and
incidence of CKD may continue to in-
crease as well. Currently, individuals with
diabetes are suboptimally managed with
respect to CVD risk factors and overall
glucose management (18). Less than half
of individuals with CKD in the Framing-
ham Heart Study had optimal A1C levels
(31). Further, among individuals with
CKD, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslip-
idemia, less than 10% of participants had
optimal management of all of their risk
factors. Improvement in CVD risk factor
management, particularly diabetes, will
be necessary to prevent further increases
in CKD prevalence. Whether interven-
tions focusing on weight loss and choles-
terol reduction will reduce the risk of
CKD require further study.
In conclusion, improvements in hy-
pertension and high cholesterol manage-
ment have been offset by both diagnosed
and undiagnosed diabetes. Further in-
creases in CKD may occur if diabetes con-
tinues to increase.
