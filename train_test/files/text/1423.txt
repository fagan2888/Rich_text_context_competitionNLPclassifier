We describe CShapes, a new dataset that provides historical maps
of state boundaries and capitals in the post-World War II period.
The dataset is coded according to both the Correlates of War and
the Gleditsch and Ward (1999) state lists, and is therefore compatible
with a great number of existing databases in the discipline. Provided
in a geographic data format, CShapes can be used directly with
standard GIS software, allowing a wide range of spatial computa-
tions. In addition, we supply a CShapes package for the R statistical
toolkit. This package enables researchers without GIS skills to per-
form various useful operations on the GIS maps. The paper intro-
duces the CShapes dataset and structure and gives three examples
of how to use CShapes in political science research. First, we show
how results from quantitative analysis can be depicted intuitively
as a map. The second application gives an example of comput-
ich can then be used in

KEYWORDS distance metrics, GIS, historical boundaries, maps,
spatial weights
The field of international relations centers around the state as a key unit for
research (see Lake 2002; Kahler 2002), and comparative research usually
conducts cross-country comparisons of state characteristics (see Doggan
and Pelassy 1984; Bollen, Entwisle, and Alderson 1993). The last decades
have seen a tremendous growth in the availability of empirical data at the
state level, which in turn have been used in many empirical studies. How-
ever, most existing data on states and their characteristics often lack a clear
spatial referent, and the specific units and boundaries that observations in a
data set refer to are often unclear. Many common data sets contain inaccu-
racies or anachronisms that, we surmise, are not at all obvious to users and
only become apparent upon close inspection. The Penn World Tables data,
for example, impose current state/border configurations on all the historical
data reported (Heston, Summers, and Aten 2006). This in turn means that
historical observations for "Germany" prior to unification encompass
population estimates for both the Federal and the Democratic Republics
together, although the two were clearly administered as separate states.
Moreover, data for "Russia" prior to the end of the Soviet Union are esti-
mates of the Russian Federation only, although the former Soviet Republics
clearly were part of an integrated state at the time.
Likewise, although the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
and maps have become increasingly common in international relations and
comparative research, most standard software packages tend to have default
global maps that conform to current state boundaries, without any addi-
tional information to reflect changes over time. As such, these maps do not
incorporate changes in the configuration and shape of states (for example
the secession of Bangladesh/East Pakistan from Pakistan in 1971). Not
surprisingly, using current maps to represent historical time periods can
introduce many inaccuracies in applied work.
In this paper we present the CShapes dataset, which contains a set of his-
torically accurate country boundaries starting in 1945, as well as routines to
perform useful operations on these in the R statistical package. Beyond dis-
playing historically accurate maps, our package allows users to take advan-
tage of geographical information for different purposes. This paper starts by
discussing how existing research has taken into account the geography of the

compatibility. We argue that a direct representation of state boundaries as
electronic maps can improve the already existing numeric indicators. The
paper proceeds with an introduction of our CShapes dataset that follows this
approach. We discuss the coding scheme and the dataset structure. The
remainder of the paper illustrates the use of CShapes with three applications:
First, the creation of maps to visualize quantities measured at the state level;
second, the computation of geographic indicators on CShapes maps; and
third, the creation of weights matrices for spatial regression modeling.
THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM
For the field of international relations, the geography of the international
system is important for at least three reasons. First, it can tell us something
about states. Country size, for example, is held to influence the likelihood
that a state will see conflict (see for example, Fearon and Laitin 2003), or a
phenomenon important to explain in its own right (for example, Lake and
O'Mahony 2004). In order to compute geographic variables such as country
size, we clearly need to know the spatial extent of states and their configu-
rations. Second, geography provides the topology in which the states interact.
This is reflected in research on territorial conflict, the diffusion of war, and
the role of distance as a determinant for cooperative and conflictual interac-
tions (for prominent examples, see Hensel and Diehl 1994; Siverson and
Starr 1991; Gleditsch 2002a; Vasquez 1995; Gochman 1991). In order to
understand the influences a state is exposed to, we need to know where
states are located relative to each other, so that we can compute characteris-
tics such as adjacency and distance between boundaries. Third, there are
many important phenomena that do not necessarily follow state boundaries
such as environmental influences, for which many data sources are now
provided in geographically disaggregated form. Prominent examples include
depositions of important environmental pollutants, such as sulphur and nitrous
oxide (see for example, Sandler 1997). This also holds for rainfall, which some
researchers have suggested is a key influence on economic growth in rain-fed
agricultural societies, with the advantage that it can be assumed to be exoge-
nous to conflict and hence be helpful as an instrument in assessing the effects
of growth shocks on conflict (Miguel, Satyanath, and Sergenti 2004). Computing
state-level estimates of these phenomena and assessing their variation within
states required us to overlay accurate boundary maps.
A number of data sources have been compiled to reflect various geo-
graphical characteristics deemed important in theoretical studies on conflictual
interactions. These include data on contiguity (Gochman 1991), minimum dis-
tances between states (Gleditsch and Ward 2001), shared boundary length
(Furlong and Gleditsch 2003) and territorial change (Tir, Schafer, Diehl, and
international system. We show that the development of multiple databases for
this purpose leaves much to be desired with regards to data consistency and

aspect of geography, and have been collected independently of one another.
Although these individual databases measure aspects of the same system, they
lack any comparable underlying data. This is obviously a less than optimal
strategy from an information representation point of view. First, it makes it dif-
ficult to compute comparable measures--how can we be sure that geographic
variables in two different datasets refer to the same geopolitical entity? Sec-
ond, these compatibility issues across datasets can make error checking and
cross validation particularly difficult. Third, and most importantly, updating
the datasets is inefficient and time-consuming. For example, with a newly
released system membership list, one would have to update multiple data-
bases at the same time. We believe that a more consistent approach to gener-
ating data on underlying geographic characteristics may be helpful.
All the above-described geographic variables depend on the same infor-
mation, which is the underlying maps of countries and their international
boundaries. Once these maps are available, very little is required for measures
such as minimum or capital distance to be computed from this geographic
information. In fact, the only step that needs human intervention is the creation
of the electronic maps; the computation of the dependent information--
distance, area, adjacency--can be left to a computer. This approach ensures
that the variables are comparable, since they refer to the same geopolitical
entities. Also, modifications in such a dataset can be done simply by changing
the underlying cartographic data and rerunning the variable computation. The
CShapes dataset and statistical package seeks to implement this approach and
to develop a geographic database for international boundaries.
THE CSHAPES DATASET
The aim of the CShapes project is to provide a direct representation of state
boundaries in a GIS dataset. However, there are a number of practical prob-
lems to be considered when developing historical maps of the international
system. The most obvious decision that has to be made concerns member-
ship in the international system, or the issue of determining and identifying
what qualifies as an independent state. For the representation of state
boundaries, we then need to identify the spatial extent of states that we
want to include in our maps. Lastly, since we are aiming for a representa-
tion of state boundaries over time, we need to identify what constitutes a
change in these boundaries. This section presents our coding decisions and
introduces the CShapes data representation as a GIS dataset.
Defining States
Many different definitions have been proposed for the coding of geopolitical
entities. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) publishes
Goertz 1998). However, previous data projects have emphasized a single
90 N. B. Weidmann et al.
the frequently used ISO 3166 country codes standard that defines numeric
or alphanumeric codes for a global list of countries (International Organization
for Standardization 2008). Another coding system for geopolitical units often
used in geographic applications is the "Federal Information Processing
Standard" (FIPS), number 10-4 (Information Technology Laboratory and
National Institute of Standards and Technology 2008). The FIPS standard is
issued by the US Federal Government and partly relies on ISO 3166. However,
there are two problems associated with these systems, which makes them diffi-
cult to apply in the social sciences. First, there is a lack of clear rules regarding
the inclusion of cases.1 Second, none of the mentioned country coding systems
includes a time dimension. ISO was first published in 1974 and is regularly
updated, but there is no consistent list for dates earlier than this.
Research in political science has produced alternative lists of states or
members in the international system, which address some of these problems.
The first widely used state list was originally proposed by Russett, Singer,
and Small (1968), and has subsequently become known as the Correlates of
War (COW) system membership list (Correlates of War Project 2008). COW
uses as its main criteria the recognition by the UK and France, membership
in the League of Nations and the United Nations, and various ad hoc deci-
sions. The COW coding scheme has been employed--in varying degrees of
consistency--by a number of other data projects, such as the widely used
Polity dataset on regime characteristics (Marshall and Jaggers 2008), and the
Minorities at Risk database on discriminated ethnic groups (Minorities at
Risk Project 2005). However, the COW list has been criticized for lacking
face validity and problematic coding decisions. Alternative lists have been
proposed, the most important of which, for our purposes, is the state list by
Gleditsch and Ward (1999). Gleditsch and Ward (GW) consider a minimum
population threshold of 250,000, whether self-declared states have territorial
control and recognition by some states, even if they do not seek an active
international role or membership in international organizations. Gleditsch
and Ward also provide a supplementary list of microstates with populations
less than 250,000 for researchers interested in including small formally inde-
pendent states. A variety of data projects uses the GW list, for example the
Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset (Gleditsch, Wallensteen, Eriksson,
Sollenberg, and Strand 2002), or the "Scalar Index of Polities" by Gates,
Hegre, Jones, and Strand (2006).
We decided to make CShapes compatible with the COW and GW lists
as both of these sources are widely used in the research community. The
differences between the two datasets mainly arise in the pre-World War II
period, where the two often have dramatically different dates of independence
1For example, ISO 3166 includes the Svalbard islands as a separate unit. However, although Svalbard has
a special status under the 1920 treaty, it falls under Norwegian sovereignty and is administrated by a
governor directly appointed by the Norwegian government.
The CShapes Dataset 91
for many states, such as Canada or Iran/Persia. The differences are much
smaller in the period after 1945, which is currently covered by CShapes. In
this period, most of the discrepancies between the two data sources arise
from minor differences in the start and end dates of states, as well as some
major differences arising for microstates such as Andorra that often have a
substantial period of formal independence prior to becoming system mem-
bers in the COW list due to membership in the United Nations.
The Spatial Extent of a State
Once we use either the COW or the GW list to identify the relevant state enti-
ties to be coded in CShapes, we need to define their spatial extent explicitly.
According to the classic Weberian notion of the state as having a monopoly on
violence, we could define states boundaries by the territorial limits of control of
the state. This criterion is difficult to apply in practice, however, as there is a lot
of variation in the level of control that states actually exert over their territorial
units. As of the time of writing, for example, the central government of Afghan-
istan does not actually exercise control over much of the territory for which it
claims sovereignty.
Another possible criterion, conceptually similar to that of the COW list,
would be to consider the internationally accepted boundaries of states. In prac-
tice, boundaries are often disputed, and many states often claim the same terri-
tory. Venezuela, for example, makes a claim to all of the territory west of the
Essequibo River, which constitutes more than half of the territory claimed by
Guyana, although they have so far not used force to seize the territory. In other
cases such as Kashmir, China and Pakistan occupy territory seized by force
from India, but without India recognizing their claim to the territory. Finally,
many states formally recognize states that do not control the territory claimed,
such as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in Moroccan-controlled Western
Sahara.
For the CShapes project, we take a pragmatic approach and consider
the conventional international boundaries recognized by most states and
where another state is not clearly exercising control over the territory. Our
coding approach is stepwise in that we first identify the relevant states in
the system and then find spatial representations of their extent. We include
only what we call the "core" territory of a state, and leave out the depen-
dent territories such as colonies or militarily-occupied territories outside the
recognized boundaries of states. As such, not every point on Earth will be
included in a CShapes polygon at any given point in time, as there may be
significant territories that do not fall within the core of a state. For example,
sub-Saharan Africa in 1947 consists of only three polygons (Ethiopia,
Liberia, and South Africa), since the rest of the continent was under colonial
rule at that time. More recently, territorial units such as Antarctica are not
coded as part of any state.
92 N. B. Weidmann et al.
An alternative to our approach of proceeding from states to territories
would be to determine for each individual territorial unit at different points in
time whether it belongs to an independent state, and what its status is. Such
information would certainly be desirable, but this approach is much more com-
plex and would require a great deal more work and resources than we have at
our disposal. However, our approach of starting with a positive list of states can
certainly be extended to include territories other than the core if need be, and it
would be possible to code the remaining parts of the globe outside the core ter-
ritories into residual polygons based on the information in CShapes.
Territorial Changes
The shape and configuration of a state's core territory can change over time.
We distinguish between two important cases: First, territorial changes may
occur when states merge or dissolve, and second, state configurations may
change in the absence of emergence or disappearance of states. One example
of the first kind of territorial change is the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in
1992, when the two constituent members of the federation (that is, the
Czech and Slovak Republics) emerge as new independent states. In CShapes,
we see two new polygons replacing the former polygon for Czechoslovakia,
but other polygons bordering Czechoslovakia are not affected. Conversely,
German unification, where the former German Democratic Republic joined
the German Federal Republic in 1990, implies a merger of two polygons, but
also without any changes in other polygons. Examples of territorial adjust-
ments unrelated to changes in the number of independent states include the
entry of Newfoundland to Canada in 1948, or the incorporation of the Azouzou
strip, previously held by Chad, into Libya in 1972.
Information on territorial changes related to system membership can be
obtained from the state lists that CShapes relies on (COW or GW). Both lists
provide entry and exit dates at the level of days for all independent states
they contain. We aligned all the dates of territorial changes where states
enter and leave the international system with the date given in the two state
lists. For example, in line with both state lists, the boundaries of East and
West Germany are coded as active until October 2, 1990. The new bound-
aries of the unified Germany replace the old territorial division beginning
October 3, 1990. As we show below, CShapes contains separate entry/exit
dates for the two state lists, since in a number of cases the two state lists
have different dates of independence.
Changes of the second type--boundary adjustments without changes
in system membership--are taken from the Territorial Changes dataset by
Tir et al. (1998).2 The dataset lists all territorial changes that involved at least

The CShapes Dataset 93
one member of the international system in the period 1816­1996, including
the exact dates. Each change is coded in a directional fashion, by listing the
gainer and the loser of a particular piece of land. In order to make our effort
of representing changes over space and time feasible, we had to limit the
number of cases from the Territorial Changes dataset included in CShapes.
In particular, we apply three restrictions. First, we select all changes that
occurred during and after 1946, because CShapes covers only the post-
World War II period. Second, CShapes aims to represent only the core territory
of states, so we disregard all changes not affecting the homeland territory of
a state. This selection was done using the "gaintype" and "losetype" vari-
ables in the Territorial Changes dataset. Third, we limit ourselves to major
territorial changes in area and only code transfers affecting an area equivalent
to 100 km × 100 km. Also, this selection was performed using the information
in the Territorial Changes dataset by setting a minimum threshold of 10,000
in the "area" variable. This leaves us with a final set of 35 territorial changes
relevant for CShapes. Note, however, that the Territorial Changes dataset
has not been updated beyond the year 2000. Hence, for the 2001­2008 period
CShapes includes only changes related to the emergence/disappearance of
new states, but no boundary adjustments between existing states that may
have occurred.
The Representation of State Boundaries in a GIS Dataset
Software and standards for the processing of spatial data have developed at
an amazing speed over the last decade. These so-called geographic infor-
mation systems (GIS) are also finding their way into the social sciences.
Since the aim of CShapes is to give an explicit spatial representation of state
boundaries, it is a straightforward decision to use a geographic data format
for CShapes. GIS data come in two fundamentally different types. First, raster
datasets divide the geographic space into equal-sized cells, and a particular
value is stored for each of them. For example, territorial elevation is typically
represented as a raster dataset with an elevation level for each cell. Second,
vector datasets represent the geographic features of interest directly, either
as points, lines or polygons. For example, in a dataset on rivers, we can
store each river as a line represented by a number of connected points in
the geographic space. We refer readers interested in more details about GIS
tools and data to other specialized references such as Longley, Goodchild,
Maguire, and Rhind (2005).
The GIS vector data approach is particularly suitable for CShapes, since
we are dealing with a finite number of geographic entities (states in our
case). In addition, vector data typically allow for additional, nonspatial
information to be stored along with each geographic feature. This is done
by providing a so-called "attribute table" in addition to the spatial features,
for example, rivers or roads. Each feature is linked to a record in the
94 N. B. Weidmann et al.
attribute table, which contains supplementary information. In a river dataset,
for example, the attribute table may contain the name of the river. In
CShapes, we represent states as polygons, where each polygon is linked to
the corresponding record in the dataset's attribute table. Figure 1 illustrates
the dataset structure graphically.3 Note, however, that with a simple poly-
gon representation we would have to represent noncontiguous states with a
set of polygons and their corresponding rows in the attribute table. This
would lead to a very complex and error-prone dataset. Instead, we rely on
an extension of the polygon vector format, the multi-polygon representa-
tion. Instead of linking each polygon to a single row, a set of polygons is
represented by a record in the attribute table. This allows for a convenient
data format where, for example, a country like Indonesia corresponds to
exactly one record in the attribute table, even though it consists of 121 dis-
connected polygons.
For each territorial change, CShapes contains polygons that reflect the
status quo before and after the change. For example, the breakup of a
country A into countries B and C would be coded with three polygons: one
representing the extent of country A before the dissolution, and two poly-
gons giving the extent of countries B and C after the breakup. How do we
code the temporal dimension of these changes? Whereas GIS vector data
formats are perfectly suited for the representation of spatially explicit infor-
mation, there is no support for linking this information to a particular point
in time. We solve this problem by following the common approach of cod-
ing a "lifetime" for each state polygon. More precisely, each polygon has a
start date and an end date stored in its attribute table, which indicates the
period when it is active. For each territorial change, we assign a lifetime that
ends the day before the change occurs to all polygons that reflect the status
3CShapes uses the shapefile format, a frequently used vector data format, originally developed by the
Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). A technical description is available online (http://
www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf).
FIGURE 1 CShapes data representation as a GIS shapefile. Countries are represented by
polygons, each of which is linked to a record in the attribute table where additional information
about the country is stored.
The CShapes Dataset 95
before the change. All polygons representing the status after the change are
assigned a lifetime that starts on the day the change happened. In the above
example, if we assume the breakup of country A to occur on a given day d,
the lifetime of the polygon representing country A ends at time d-1, and the
lifetime of the two successor polygons starts at d. If there is no information
on the particular day a change occurred, we code the middle of the respec-
tive month.
Coding Procedure and Result
CShapes was created by starting with a 2006 GIS dataset and backdating it
step by step, according to the changes given in the system membership and
territorial changes datasets. The original dataset is provided by ESRI (2006)
and contains the boundaries of states and dependent territories. We started
by matching the entities in the original dataset to the state lists and deleted
all polygons that did not match an independent state as coded by the state
lists. We then worked our way backwards in time, creating new polygons
for each relevant territorial change as introduced above. We consulted addi-
tional sources in all cases where the extent of the respective boundary
change was not readily available. This was almost always the case for
boundary changes of the second type (that is, adjustments without changes
in system membership). The final dataset contains 241 polygons, where the
vast majority of countries (177) are represented by one polygon. 15 countries
have two polygons in the dataset, and 9 countries have three or more.
Figure 2 illustrates the result of the coding process for the breakup of
Yugoslavia. We present the example as series of snapshots, taken at the end
of each month when a territorial change occurred. Each panel shows the
currently active polygons as solid lines. Note that because the breakup of
the Federation occurred in a stepwise fashion with the former Republics
seceding at different times, we need to code multiple polygons for what
constitutes the core territory of the Federation. The lifetimes of these poly-
gons are shown in the plot.
USING CSHAPES: APPLICATIONS
We believe that CShapes can be useful for a variety of applications in quan-
titative research, and in this section we present some examples to illustrate
this. The first example shows how to use CShapes for creating map visual-
izations of variables of interest. Our second application deals with the com-
putation of state-level geographic variables, which require information about
the extent of states, as contained in our dataset. Lastly, we demonstrate the
use of CShapes in the context of spatial regression models.

were established. Solid lines indicate polygons that are active at the given date. For illustration
purposes, the date range given in the plot shows the lifespan of the currently active polygon
that represents Yugoslavia (and later Serbia, COW code 345).
The CShapes Dataset 97
As described above, CShapes relies on a GIS vector data format.
Although this data format by itself is perfectly adequate for the storage of spa-
tial information, lack of GIS skills among researchers might limit its spread in
the research community. We have therefore decided to distribute CShapes in
two ways: the raw dataset itself in a vector data format, accompanied by a
software package that connects our dataset to the R statistical toolkit, the latter
providing functionality for processing spatial data (Weidmann and Gleditsch
2010).4 This dual dissemination strategy builds on recent efforts to introduce
new, open-source tools for spatial analysis in the social sciences (Rey and
Anselin 2006), among them the R spatial extensions (Bivand 2006). The
CShapes package for R allows scholars without a GIS background to get
access to the information in CShapes and to perform a variety of tasks
required to use the dataset for their own research. To illustrate this approach,
the applications presented in the remainder of this section rely only on the
CShapes R package and do not require any additional proprietary software.
Spatio-Temporal Mapping
Quantitative studies often rely exclusively on numbers and tables to com-
municate their results. Recent attempts have been made to find graphical
ways to present the outcome of quantitative analysis (Kastellec and Leoni
2007). However, for many applications in international relations where
states are the units of analysis, it might be beneficial to opt for a geographic
way of showing results pertaining to these. This is a straightforward idea,
but might be more difficult to implement in practice. What is required is a
set of geographic entities that correspond to the commonly used units of
analysis, and an easy way to link other variables of interest to these entities.
CShapes makes it possible to do this, as it provides state polygons that are
compatible with the commonly used state lists in political science.
We demonstrate the creation of spatial plots using the Fearon and
Laitin (2003) model for the onset of civil war. Using Model 1 from their
study, we compute the predicted risk of civil war onset and show its geo-
graphical variation.5 Figure 3 shows the model predictions for 1985 and
1995, with darker colors corresponding to a higher predicted risk. We limit
our presentation here to two years, but it could obviously be repeated for
other points in time. These maps show how there are many countries with a
low predicted risk of conflict, located mostly in Europe and the Americas,
and that certain subregions contain the countries with higher risks of con-
flict. One difference between the maps is that the 1995 predicted conflict

5In the original Fearon and Laitin model, missing values for GDP lead to many cases being dropped
from the original analysis, including cases of civil war, such as Bosnia. Therefore, we replace the original
GDP variable with a more complete version provided by Gleditsch (2002b).

propensity in Africa reaches higher values than in the 1985 example, as
indicated by the higher number of dark shaded countries in Africa accord-
ing to the 1995 map (Figure 3, right).
Geographic Variables for Countries
Quantitative analysis on states often requires indicators of certain aspects of
a state's geography. For example, the study by Fearon and Laitin (2003)
mentioned in the previous paragraph includes a variable for "roughness of
terrain," measured at the state level. If geographic variables cannot readily
be obtained from existing sources, they need to be computed from scratch.
For simpler applications, this can be done using the R package, but as indi-
cators get more complex, advanced GIS software is required. However, the
computation of spatial indicators at the state level--whether it is done in R
or a more advanced package--requires information about state boundaries
over time, as provided in CShapes.
FIGURE 3 Predicted risk of civil war onset for 1985 (top) and 1995 (bottom), computed using.
Model 1 in Fearon and Laitin (2003). Darker colors correspond to a higher predicted risk of
conflict (4 shadings, based on a equal-sized class intervals over the range of predicted values).
The CShapes Dataset 99
In this section, we present an example of computing a new spatial indi-
cator using the CShapes R package. As in the previous section, we study
civil war and how it relates to a country's geographic makeup. More pre-
cisely, we depart from the assumption that a state's risk of experiencing civil
war should be related to its capability of repressing dissent in peripheral
areas. For example, Herbst (2000) argues that the difficult geographies of
African states can partly account for the many failed attempts at state-building
in this region. Here, a difficult geography relates to problems of projecting
power across the entire territory of a state. Unrest in peripheral regions is
more likely to develop into full-fledged civil war if the state fails to provide
a sufficient level of control. Existing research has found that distance from
the capital is related to a higher risk of conflict. For example, the analysis by
Buhaug, Cederman, and Rød (2008) shows that ethnic groups which are
located far away from the capital face a higher risk of conflict. If the hinter-
land is indeed characterized by lower state control and thus a higher risk of
conflict, states that have more extensive hinterlands should generally see
more conflict.
In the following example we consider a simple test of this relationship.
We posit that states in which the capital is located at a strategically advanta-
geous position should be better able to contain unrest. We further posit that
the optimal location for a capital is at the center of the state's boundaries, so
that a state can maximize its ability to project power across the state's terri-
tory. A territorially unbalanced configuration, in which the capital is located
at a corner or edge of a state, may create a fair amount of distant hinterland
territory, where state control is relatively weak and the risk of conflict is
high. As a simple measure of the territorial balance of a state, we consider
the deviation between the centroid (that is, the geographic center point of
its boundaries) and the actual location of the capital. Two cases help to
illustrate this measure. Figure 4 shows the borders of two African countries,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria, as well as their capitals
and their polygon centroids. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (left),
the capital Kinshasa is located in the far West of the country, which creates
large hinterlands in the East. Nigeria (right) has a more balanced configura-
tion, with the capital Abuja located close to the centroid.
We compute two indicators for the deviation from the capital to the
polygon centroid, the first one being the absolute distance between the two
points. However, since this deviation is likely to be correlated with the
country's absolute size, we also compute a relative deviation measure by
dividing the absolute value by the diameter of the country.6 We test the
6The diameter of a polygon is defined as the maximum distance of any pair of points on the polygon
boundary. However, for the sake of computational simplicity, here we approximate the polygon diameter
by the diameter of the polygon's bounding box, i.e. the smallest rectangle with straight North­South and
East­West lines that includes the polygon.

the regression. In Models 3 and 4, we add these variables to the original
Fearon and Laitin Model 1.
Absolute distance between capital and centroid seems to be related to
civil war onset when included as a single explanatory variable in Model 1.
As we hypothesized, we find a significant and positive coefficient. This is
not the case for relative capital deviation (Model 3), where we also see a
positive coefficient, but the estimate is far from statistically significant.
Model 3 reveals that the positive effect of absolute capital distance disap-
pears once we control for other civil war determinants included in the orig-
inal model. In conclusion, our analysis provides little evidence that supports
the proposed relationship between the optimal capital location and the risk
of civil war. However, the above measure is very crude and does not take
other factors into account, that is, the population distribution in the country.
Rather than the deviation from the purely geographic center of gravity, a
better measure would be the deviation from the population center of gravity,
since ultimately it is people that need to be controlled by the state to sup-
press rebellion. Even though this is beyond the scope of this illustrative
example, such alternative indicators can be computed using the CShapes
data in combination with other geographic datasets.
Distances Between States
Regression models with spatial dependence are an important application for
data on distances between states. Social scientists are becoming increasingly
sensitive to how observations pooled over time require special attention to pos-
sible problems of serial dependence. However, cross-sections--samples of
observations at a given point in time--are usually taken to be independent of
one another, and there is less attention to the possibility that observations may
be dependent across space. In an influential early comment, Galton (1889)
argued that an analysis comparing marital institutions across societies could face
difficulties in making valid inferences if the observed institutions were the result
of diffusion processes (hence the name "Galton's problem"). Likewise, if
policies enacted in one country are the result of emulation of other states or
competitive processes (Simmons and Elkins 2004), the policies of individual
states will not be independent of those adopted in other states.
In many instances, it is likely that such dependence between observa-
tions will be a function of spatial distance, since states tend to interact more
with proximate countries and closer countries are more likely to serve as
role models or reference points. As an illustrative example, consider the
extent to which states have democratic institutions. Many have argued that
democracy is likely to be a function of economic or social characteristics,
but there are many reasons to expect that countries will be more/less likely
to have democratic institutions if their neighbors have more/less democratic
institutions (see Gleditsch 2002a for a more comprehensive discussion).
102 N. B. Weidmann et al.
One way to determine whether a country's degree of democracy
depends on that of its neighbors is to examine the similarity between a
country's own institutional makeup and a weighted average of the level of
democracy in its neighboring countries. The latter can be seen as a "spatial
lag," analogous to the temporal lag of variable. More specifically, we can
represent connections between states by a connectivity matrix C where indi-
vidual entities cij
acquire non-zero values if two units i and j are connected
to one another. The spatial lag of a variable y is then computed by Wy,
where W is a row-normalized version of the connectivity matrix C where
the individual rows wi·
add up to 1. A variable displays spatial dependence
or correlation to the extent that individual observations of yi
tend to be sim-
ilar to the values of the spatial lag wi·
y. CShapes allows us to create a con-
nectivity matrix C based on different connectivity criteria; for example direct
contiguity, distance between capital cities, or minimum distance between
boundaries.
In our example, the outcome of interest--democracy--is also likely to
be influenced by other characteristics such as income, which may also be
spatially correlated. Hence, it is useful to consider spatial dependence in
democracy jointly with what may be attributed to income. One way to do
this is to consider democracy (y) as a conditional function of logged per
capita income (x1
) and the spatial lag of democracy, i.e.,
This conditional expected value can be estimated via linear regression.
Such a regression model is often called a "spatially lagged y" model, and
can be seen as a spatial analogy to a model with a temporal lag yt-1
on
the right hand side. The fact that y appears on both sides of the equation
implies a simultaneity problem that makes estimation problematic, but it
is possible to fit such a model via maximum likelihood. We refer to
Ward and Gleditsch (2008) for further details on spatial dependence,
constructing spatial variables, and model estimation, and focus here only
on an example of how measures of spatial connectivities can be derived
from CShapes.
Table 2 shows the results of an OLS regression of democracy (measured
by the 21-point POLITY scale) and logged per capita income from Gleditsch
(2002b) for data on states at December 31, 2004, as well as a second expanded
model including a spatial lag. The lag is based on an adjacency matrix
where states are considered connected if within 500 km of one another,
which is computed using the distmatrix() R function provided by CShapes.
For simplicity, we drop all islands or observations with no neighbors within
500 kms. As can be seen, we find a positive and highly significant estimate
for the parameter r, indicating that a country's level of democracy is

strongly associated with that of its neighbors. The coefficient estimate for
the log of GDP per capita, while still significant, is considerably smaller for
the spatial lag model. However, the two parameters have different interpre-
tations, since assessing the total impact of a change in xi
in the spatial lag
model would need to take into account the implied feedback between
observations.8
CONCLUSION
The geography of the international system plays a major role in quantitative
research, but is often not considered in a systematic manner. In this paper,
we have introduced the CShapes project, a geographic dataset of historical
state boundaries that covers the period 1946­2008. CShapes is a GIS dataset
that represents state boundaries with polygons. In order to capture changes
over time, these polygons are assigned a "lifespan" during which they are
active. The direct representation of state boundaries has a number of advan-
tages over the creation of separate datasets, e.g., for minimum or capital dis-
tance, since it avoids problems of consistency and updating. In addition to
the GIS dataset, CShapes comes with an accompanying R package that
enables users who are unfamiliar with GIS to take full advantage of the
data. We have illustrated the use of the package with three examples. First,
the package allows for the creation of plots to map particular quantities of
interest, providing users a quick and easy way to communicate results from
their research. Second, using CShapes, it is possible to compute geographic
variables at the state level as for example a measure for the strategic quality
of the capital location as we have shown. Third, CShapes is a valuable basis
for the computation of weights matrices for spatial statistics. The corresponding
8More specifically, with a spatially lagged y, a change in a right-hand-side xki
for country i will first change
yi
directly, and then indirectly, through the effects of yi
on the neighbors of i, which in turn feed back
onto i, and reverberate through the system until reaching a new equilibrium. Hence, the full "equilibrium
impact" needs to be computed using the spatial multiplier (I - rW)-1 (see Ward and Gleditsch 2008).
