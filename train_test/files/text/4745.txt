Abstract
Background: Diagnosing capitellar osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) can be difficult, causing delay in treating young
athletes. The main aim of this retrospective diagnostic study was to determine which radiological technique is preferred
to identify and classify elbow OCD.
Methods: We identified young patients who underwent elbow arthroscopy because of symptomatic OCD. We included
all patients who had pre-operative radiographs, a computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) available. We assessed whether the osteochondral lesion could be identified using the various imaging modalities.
All lesions were classified according to previous classifications for X-ray, CT and MRI, respectively. These results were
compared with findings at arthroscopy.
Results: Twenty-five patients had pre-operative radiographs as well as CT scans and MRI. In six patients, the lesion was
not visible on standard X-ray. In 20 patients, one or two loose bodies were found during surgery, consistent with an
unstable lesion. Pre-operatively, this was seen on 11 X-rays, 13 MRIs and 18 CT scans.
Conclusions: Capitellar OCD lesions are not always visible on standard X-rays. A CT appears to be the preferred
imaging technique to confirm diagnosis of OCD. Loose bodies are often missed, especially on standard X-rays and MRIs.

Introduction
Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the elbow is a con-
dition of the subchondral bone and overlying cartilage,
mostly affecting a part of the humeral capitellum. The
capitellum of the immature elbow has a tenuous vascu-
lar supply consisting of one or two posterior vessels.
There is no metaphyseal blood supply until the physis
closes.1,2 This makes the capitellum vulnerable to
repetitive microtrauma in overhead athletes.
During overhead sports, such as baseball, gymnas-
tics, volleyball, javelin throwing and tennis, tremendous
valgus forces are generated across the elbow joint.3,4
These valgus forces result in attenuation on the
medial side and compression of the lateral side.
These compression forces can lead to injury of the
poorly vascularized growth plate of the capitellum.5­9
This is why OCD most commonly occurs in the adoles-
cent age.
The onset of symptoms is insidious and many ath-
letes will initially only complain of inexplicit lateral-

sided elbow pain. As signs and symptoms are vague
primarily, obtaining the definite diagnosis in these
young athletes is delayed for months or even years.
Symptoms average 1­2 years before an appropriate
treatment takes place.8
Treatment is conservative or operative, depending
on type, stage and stability of the lesion.9,10 Early rec-
ognition and appropriate intervention may protect
them from fragmentation of the OCD lesion and
developing irreversible cartilage damage.7,8
Imaging usually starts with standard anteroposterior
(AP) and lateral plain radiographs; however, plain
radiographs lack sensitivity, which is approximately
44% to 47% according to previous studies.8,11,12
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed
tomography (CT) scans are probably more sensitive.
There are some reports on the sensitivity and specificity
of MRI versus X-rays. Satake et al.12 found a MRI
sensitivity of 84%. Itsubo et al.13 found 100% sensitiv-
ity and 80% specificity for diagnosing OCD on MRI.
Jans et al.14 reported a sensitivity of 100% on MRI,
only when using all kinds of characteristics of an
unstable elbow OCD lesion together. None of the char-
acteristics was sensitive by itself. No data exist on the
comparison of all three imaging techniques: standard
X-ray, MRI and CT scans.
It is important to classify the lesion to determine
whether it is stable or unstable. This will determine the
type of treatment and is closely related to the prognosis.
A stable lesion will most likely heal naturally with rest of
the elbow but, when a lesion has become unstable, sur-
gery provides significantly better results.8,9,12
The aim of the present study was to determine which
radiological technique is preferred for the identification
of OCD of the young elbow joint and to classify the
OCD lesion.
Materials and methods
We retrospectively identified patients who underwent
arthroscopy of the elbow because of a symptomatic
OCD lesion between January 2008 and July 2014. All
arthroscopies were performed by a single orthopedic
surgeon (DE). Most patients were referred to us from
other hospitals, whereas others came directly to our
clinic. Therefore, patients had variable imaging modal-
ities performed. Most patients had a pre-operative
X-ray and MRI or a pre-operative X-ray and a CT
scan. Some of these patients had undergone all three
imaging modalities, mostly because they had been seen
by several different doctors. We included just this last
group of patients, who had pre-operative radiographs,
MRI and a CT scan available, aiming to achieve a
direct comparison of the imaging studies within one
patient (Figures 1 to 3). Therefore, all patients missing
one or more of these pre-operative imaging modalities
were excluded.
All three imaging studies were reviewed by two
experienced elbow and sports orthopedic surgeons
(DE and MvdB). Both assessed independently whether
or not the osteochondral lesion could be identified
using the various imaging modalities. Any discrepan-
cies were resolved by a consensus discussion.
All lesions were classified according to the classi-
fications of Minami et al.,15 Clanton and DeLee,16
and Itsubo et al.13 for X-ray, CT and MRI, respect-
ively (Table 1). There is no verified classification of
OCD of the elbow for CT images; therefore we used
the classification of Clanton and DeLee16 for osteo-
chondritis dissecans of the knee. This is a well-
known and validated classification system for OCD
lesions.13,15,16
The location of the OCD lesion was described in the
sagittal and coronal plane. The sagittal plane of the

capitellum was equally divided into three parts: anter-
ior, central and posterior. The coronal plane of the
capitellum was also equally divided into three parts:
lateral, central and medial.
A stable lesion was determined by the following clas-
sifications: Minami grade I, Itsubo stages 1 and 2, and
Clanton and DeLee stages 1 and 2. An unstable lesion
was in its turn classified by Minami grades II and III,

All imaging results were compared to the gold stand-
ard defined as the findings observed at arthroscopy.
The International Cartilage Repair Society has pro-
posed an arthroscopic classification system for OCD
lesions.17 Grade 1 indicates a stable lesion with a con-
tinuous but softened area covered by intact cartilage;
grade 2 is a lesion with partial discontinuity that is
stable when probed; grade 3 is a lesion with a complete
discontinuity that is not yet dislocated; and grade 4 is
an empty defect, as well as a defect with a dislocated
fragment or a loose fragment lying within the bed. All
lesions were defined as stable or unstable intra-
operatively.
Patient records provided information on patients'
sex, age at the time of surgery, hand dominance, ath-
letic activity, and time between onset of symptoms and
diagnosis.
Results
Patient demographics
Of the 106 patients who underwent arthroscopy of the
elbow because of symptomatic OCD of the capitellum,
25 patients had pre-operative radiographs as well as a
CT scan and MRI available. The average age was 17
years, ranging from 12 years to 23 years. Thirteen
patients were male and 12 were female. In 18 patients,
the right elbow was affected and, in seven patients, the
left elbow was affected. This was the dominant arm in
17 patients. All patients participated in at least one
sport. Half of them were either gymnasts or tennis
players (Table 2). The median period between onset
of symptoms and diagnosis was 24 months, ranging
from 1 month to 192 months. Patients all complained
of vague lateral elbow pain with loading of the elbow
that worsened with activity. Some also showed loss of
motion or locking symptoms. Six of the 25 patients
reported an acute trauma to their elbow.
Pre-operative imaging
The OCD lesion was visible on X-ray in 19 of the 25
elbows. It was seen on nine X-rays only on the AP
radiograph and, on 10 X-rays, the lesion was seen on
both AP and lateral views. Grading of all OCD lesions
is presented in Table 3. The radiographic grading did
not correspond to either the MRI or CT grading.
One lesion that was not observed on X-ray was also
not seen on MRI. The other lesions were all visible on
MRI. All lesions were diagnosed on CT. The sagittal
views appeared to be most sensitive; the OCD lesion
was visible in 22 of 25 MRIs and 25 of 25 CT scans.
The coronal views showed the lesion in 21 of 25 MRIs

and 25 of 25 CT scans. The axial views were the least
accurate, showing the lesion in 16 of 25 MRIs and 21 of
25 CT scans.
During surgery, the OCD lesion was unstable and
accompanied by one or two loose bodies in 20 of
the 25 patients (Table 4). Pre-operatively, this was
seen in 11 of the X-rays, in 13 of the MRIs and in
18 of the CT scans. This means that the sensitivity
of these imaging techniques for determining whether
the lesion is unstable is 55%, 65% and 90%,
respectively.
Localization of the OCD lesion was determined by
CT (Figure 4). Most lesions were located in the central-
central region of the capitellum.

Discussion
Capitellar OCD occurs mainly in young athletes who
are engaged in overhead sports. Unfortunately, there is
still a serious delay in diagnosis and treatment. It
is noteworthy that the average age of our patients
is fairly high at 17 years, ranging up to 23 years, as a
result of a missed or delayed diagnosis. One patient
was, in fact, symptomatic for 16 years.
Early recognition and appropriate intervention may
protect adolescents from fragmentation of the OCD
lesion and developing irreversible cartilage damage.
Treatment depends on type, stage and stability of the
lesion. In the present study, CT of the elbow is the best
radiological technique for identifying and classifying
capitellar OCD.
Satake et al.12 also compared radiographs, CT scans
and MRIs with intra-operative findings, although their
patients did not all have CT and MRI studies for a
direct comparison. It was found that pre-operative
radiographs correlated with an intra-operative diagno-
sis of unstable lesions in 44% of cases when using the

Minami classification. When specifically looking at
closure of the capitellar epiphyseal line on X-ray, a sen-
sitivity of 88% of detecting was found for an unstable
lesion. Articular irregularity and T2 high signal inten-
sity interface on MRI correlated with the intra-opera-
tive finding of whether the lesion was stable or unstable,
both with a sensitivity of 73%.12
Jans et al.14 looked at specific findings of an unstable
OCD lesion of the elbow on MRI: high T2 signal inten-
sity rim, cysts, high T2 signal intensity fracture line
extending through the articular cartilage overlying an
OCD lesion, and a fluid-filled OCD. A sensitivity of
100% was reported when using all criteria together.
None of these criteria was sensitive by itself.14
To our knowledge, there are no studies describing the
sensitivity of CT in OCD of the elbow. One reason for
this could be that, in clinical practice, CT scans might not
be used as much as MRI for detecting OCD lesions.
However, CT can accurately identify and localize a
lesion at the same time as defining its extent.
Furthermore, CT had the advantage of a wider availabil-
ity and a shorter acquisition time compared to MRI.18
Of course, hazards of radiation exposure must
always be weighed against their clinical utility when
ordering imaging studies, especially when delivered to
a largely skeletally immature population. Nevertheless,
it is good to keep in mind that the effective dose for a CT
scan of the elbow is only 0.14 mSv. In comparison, the
effective doses of CT scans of the shoulder and thoracic
spine are 2.06 mSv and 17.99 mSv, respectively. The
background dose as a result of natural radiation expos-
ure is approximately 3 mSv per person per year.19
In the present study, localization of the OCD lesion
was determined by CT. It is our opinion that defining
localization of the lesion during surgery is not suffiently
accurate and reliable. It also shows a great discrepancy
compared to a CT scan. Kimball et al.2 showed a pre-
dominant posterior blood supply to the distal lateral
humerus and a relative watershed area on the medial
side. This is not coherent with the localizations of the
lesions in the present study. Therefore, this probably is
not the only issue concerning the development of capi-
tellar OCD.
The strengths of the present study include the rela-
tive large group of patients who all had pre-operative
X-ray as well as MRI and CT scans of their elbow. To
our knowledge, this is the first study comparing all
three pre-operative imaging techniques with the surgi-
cal findings of OCD of the humeral capitellum. In the
present study, well known, validated, classification sys-
tems have been used.13,15,16
We acknowledge limitations to the present study.
First, it is a retrospective study in which all patients
had already undergone surgery for symptomatic OCD
of the elbow. We did not include a control group of
patients without OCD when assessing radiographs,
MRI and CT scans. Nevertheless, it shows how many
OCD lesions are missed on standard radiographs.
Second, the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility
of the findings of the three imaging techniques was not
assessed. Both orthopedic surgeons reviewed all images
independently. However, any discrepancies were
resolved by a consensus discussion. When looking at
grading the OCD lesions, Claessen et al.20 demonstrate
that the inter-observer reliability of the currently used
classification systems for OCD of the humeral capitel-
lum is poor to fair. The Minami classification was sig-
nificantly the most reliable when classifying the
different stages of OCD of the humeral capitellum,
although still with only fair agreement.20
Third, Takahara et al.8 suggest using an anterior
image of the elbow in 45 flexion because OCD lesions
may be underdiagnosed on the basis of AP radiographs
of the elbow in extension. In the present study, none of
the patients had AP radiographs taken in 45 of elbow
flexion. Changing that protocol might improve the sen-
sitivity of radiographic imaging of OCD. Fourth, the
quality of the MRI was variable. Referring hospitals do
not all use the same resolution power. Next to that, our
patients are younger and more active, which might have
resulted in more body movement. This has a greater
effect on MRIs than on CT.
Conclusions
In conclusion, based on the findings in the present
study, it appears that a CT of the elbow is the best
imaging technique for confirming the diagnosis of
OCD, especially in the unstable stage. An OCD lesion
of the capitellum is not always visible on X-ray and
loose bodies are often missed on standard X-rays and
by MRI.
A young patient with lateral elbow pain has OCD
until proven otherwise. To prevent delay in diagnosis,
we strongly recommend additional imaging studies,
preferably CT.
