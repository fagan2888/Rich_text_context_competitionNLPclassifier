Research in the Social Sciences has demonstrated repeatedly
that negative experiences (e.g., economic deprivation, frus-
tration, economic threat) increase racism (Brown, 1995). The
implied converse is that positive experiences will lead to
greater tolerance. While the impact of negative life experi-
ences on racism has been studied for more than half a cen-
tury, we know very little about the effect of the positive
experiences that tend to be associated with life satisfaction
(Pettigrew, 2002). Interestingly, recent research in social
psychology suggests that positive life experiences may actu-
ally be related to elevated levels of racism. This counterintui-
tive theorizing points to the need to examine the link between
racism and life satisfaction.
Interestingly for our purpose, recent research reveals that
Relative Gratification, the complete opposite of Relative
Deprivation, is a powerful determinant of various forms of
hostile intergroup attitudes (see, for example, Dambrun,
Guimond & Taylor, 2006; Harth, Kessler, & Leach, 2008;
Postmes & Smith, 2009).
According to Relative Gratification Theory (Dambrun,
Taylor, McDonald, Crush, & Méot, 2006), at least two psy-
chological processes might explain the reasons why
increased life satisfaction could lead to higher levels of rac-
ism. First, people who feel satisfied with their circum-
stances in life will naturally feel an elevated attraction to,
and pride in, the nation state that supports their desirable
living conditions. Importantly, high levels of national pride
have been linked to increased racism (Branscombe &
Wann, 1992). Second, because people of privilege tend to
endorse ideologies that favor the maintenance of their
advantaged lifestyle, (right-wing) political conservatism
should also mediate this effect. This is because political
conservatism provides moral and intellectual support for
the status quo by resisting change, and rationalizing the
existent inequalities (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, & Sulloway,
2003). In sum, we hypothesized a bilinear relationship
between the life satisfaction-dissatisfaction continuum and
racism, such that the negative and positive extremes of the
continuum would be associated with greater racism.
Moreover, we hypothesized that the effect of life satisfac-
tion on racism would be mediated by national pride and
political conservatism.
Method
Using the 1988 Euro-Barometer Survey, we tested our pre-
dictions among participants from four European countries
(France, Great Britain, Netherlands, and West Germany;
n = 4,056). Different scales assessed four separate constructs:
life satisfaction-dissatisfaction, national pride, political con-
servatism, and racism. Two items comprised the life satisfac-
tion measure (e.g., "All in all to what extent would you say
you are satisfied with the life you lead at this time?";

The Counterintuitive Association
Between Life Satisfaction and Racism
Michaël Dambrun1 and Donald M. Taylor2
Abstract
Research in social psychology has long established that racism emerges when people are threatened or confront negative
experiences (e.g., economic deprivation). An implicit assumption is that, conversely, positive experiences will be associated
with greater tolerance. Using national surveys, the present study contradicts this common sense expectation by revealing
that life satisfaction is also positively related to racism. Consistent with relative gratification theory, two psychological
processes may partially account for this counterintuitive effect: increased national pride and endorsement of status quo
ideologies that support the advantages enjoyed by those who receive benefits from the society (i.e., political conservatism).

1 = completely dissatisfied and 10 = completely satisfied;
 = .89; Items 118 and 119). National pride was assessed by
a single item (i.e., "Would you say you are very proud [4],
quite proud [3], not very proud [2], not at all proud [1], to
be [nationality]?" Item 130). A single item assessed politi-
cal conservatism (i.e., "In political matters, people talk of
"the left" [1] and "the right" [10]. How would you place
your views on this scale?" Item 476). Finally, racism was
measured using a 21-item scale (e.g., "outgroup members"
living here should not push themselves where they are not
wanted"; 1 = strongly agree, 4 = strongly disagree;  = .90;
Items 331, 332, 335, 337, 338, 339, 342-351, 354-358).
"Outgroups" included Turks (Sample 1, n = 1,047) in West
Germany, Asians (Sample 2; n = 507) and North Africans
(Sample 3; n = 494) in France, Surinamers (Sample 4;
n = 496) and Turks (Sample 5; n = 503) in Netherlands,
and Asians (sample 6; n = 500) and West Indians (sample
7; n = 509) in Great Britain. Details about the sampling
procedures and the full schedule of the Euro-Barometer 30
survey are available in Reif and Melich (1991).
Results
The predicted bilinear model assumes a different slope for
participants who enjoy life satisfaction (i.e., ratings equal
or above the median) than for those who experience life
dissatisfaction (i.e., ratings below the median). Confirming
our main hypothesis, the bilinear function was significant
(F = 39.84, p < .001). Life satisfaction ( = .097, p < .001)
and life dissatisfaction ( = -.121, p < .001) were associ-
ated with greater levels of racism.
To better understand this intriguing relationship between
life satisfaction and racism, we used structural equation
modeling, and our predicted mediation model received
strong support (see Figure 1). This model, without the dotted
line between life satisfaction and racism, produced a good fit
with the observed covariance. The chi-square value was not
significant (2 = 2.704, p > .10), and all the various indices
were more than adequate (CFI = .997, NFI = .995, GFI =
.999; AGFI = .993; RMSEA = .03). Sobel tests revealed that
an increase in national pride (z = 6.66, p < .01) and political
conservatism (z = 4.96, p < .01) significantly mediated the
effect of life satisfaction on racism.
Discussion
After decades of research on the negative life experiences
that are associated with racism, the present study reveals
that life satisfaction is also associated with greater racism,
and apparently to the same degree as life dissatisfaction.
Thus, a more complete understanding of racism demands
that the role of positive life experiences for perpetrators be
addressed.
These results confirm the key role of relative deprivation,
but in addition reveal that the relative gratification effect on
intergroup attitudes, previously largely unexplored is robust
and not limited to the laboratory context and to some coun-
tries such as France (Guimond & Dambrun, 2002) or South
Africa ( Dambrun, Taylor, McDonald, Crush & Méot, 2006).
An important aim of the present research was to explore
the potential mediating role of ethnic identification and politi-
cal conservatism. We hypothesized that when people are sat-
isfied with their circumstances in life, they might feel more
attracted to and pride in the national state that supports their
desirable living conditions. Because stronger national identi-
fication tends to be related to an increased bias against out-
groups (e.g., Dambrun, Taylor, et al., 2006; Perreault &
Bourhis, 1999), national identification should act as a media-
tor of the effect of life satisfaction on intergroup attitudes.
The results of the present research provide a clear support for
this hypothesis. The model by which national identification
mediates the effect of life satisfaction on racism was statisti-
cally significant. However, when people are in a state of rela-
tive gratification, they find themselves in a privileged position
(Kawakami & Dion, 1995). Greater prejudice toward out-
groups may emerge in an attempt to justify and maintain such
privileges. As Crocker, Major, and Steele (1998) argue,
"People of higher status may stigmatize those of lower status
to justify their advantages" (p. 509). Because political conser-
vatism provides moral and intellectual support for the status
quo by resisting change, and rationalizing the existent
inequalities (Jost et al., 2003), we predicted that political con-
servatism also would mediate the relationship between life
satisfaction and racism. Again, the results provide support for
this hypothesis. The model by which political conservatism
mediates the effect of life satisfaction on racism also was sta-
tistically significant. The path-analysis confirms that national
identification and political conservatism were two indepen-
dent mediators of this relationship. These results are the first
to our knowledge supporting the hypothesis that when people
feel gratified or satisfied with their life circumstances, they
enter in a process of justification and maintenance of their

advantaged position. Of course, a deeper investigation of this
justification process is needed.
While the results of the present research support our
hypotheses, it must be acknowledged that the correlations
between the variables are modest, accounting for a small per-
centage of variance. Because the present study is based on a
correlational design, no strong claims about causal relations
among variables can be made. For example, future research
could examine the mediating role of national identification
and political conservatism using an experimental design. On
the positive side, the present research design provides an
adequate ecological validity.
