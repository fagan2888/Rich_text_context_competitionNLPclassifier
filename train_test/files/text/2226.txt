The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that
temperatures in the major grain-growing areas of North America
will rise by 3­4 °C by 2100. Such abrupt changes will create major
challenges, significantly altering the area suitable for wheat. The
historical record offers insight into the capability of agriculture to
adapt to climatic challenges. Using a new county-level dataset on
wheat production and climate norms, we show that during the
19th and 20th centuries North American grain farmers pushed
wheat production into environments once considered too arid,
too variable, and too harsh to cultivate. As summary measures,
the median annual precipitation norm of the 2007 distribution of
North American wheat production was one-half that of the 1839
distribution, and the median annual temperature norm was 3.7 °C
lower. This shift, which occurred mostly before 1929, required new
biological technologies. The Green Revolution associated with the
pioneering work of Norman Borlaug represented an important
advance in this longer process of biological innovation. However,
well before the Green Revolution, generations of North American
farmers overcame significant climatic challenges.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
projects that by 2100 annual mean temperatures in North
America will increase by 2 to 3 °C at midlatitude coastal regions
and by "up to more than" 5 °C at more northern latitudes. In the
main grain-growing areas, the IPCC forecasts temperatures will
rise 3 to 4 °C (1). A more recent MIT study suggests far greater
changes will occur (2). There are a wide range of estimates of
how climate changes will impact agricultural production (3­7).
Numerous researchers have speculated about how farmers might
change cultivars, cropping patterns, and farming methods to
mitigate some of the costs of abrupt climatic changes (8). Re-
searchers at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
Center (CIMMYT) anticipate that North American wheat farmers
may extend the margin of wheat production roughly 1,000 km north
into northern Canada and Alaska, whereas heat and drought will
make cultivation untenable in many areas of the southern Great
Plains (9). To provide perspective on these and other predictions,
this paper asks how farmers responded to past climatic challenges.
The spread of wheat cultivation across North America required
that farmers repeatedly adapt to unfamiliar and hostile climatic
conditions. The variations in climatic conditions that settlers en-
countered rivaled the magnitude of the predicted changes at given
locations over the next century. We quantify the extent of the
geographic variations and decipher how wheat growers learned to
produce in new environments. Because of the paucity of Mexican
data before 1929, most of our analysis of "North America" refers
to Canada and the United States. Inclusion of Mexico in the later
part of the 20th century highlights the role of the Green Revo-
lution in pushing production into hotter and drier zones.
Results
The quantification of the geoclimatic conditions of wheat pro-
duction between 1839 and 2007 shows that farmers made striking
changes to adjust to climate; most of the changes in location and
the technological adjustments that made settlement possible oc-
curred before the Green Revolution.
Quantifying Geographic Changes in Production and Climate. Between
1839 and 2009, wheat output increased 26-fold in the United
States and more than 270-fold in Canada. In 1839, the geo-
graphic center (mean) of North American wheat production was
located in eastern Ohio. Cultivation was concentrated in Ohio
and New York; relatively little wheat was grown as far west as
Illinois. In 2007 the center of production had moved 1,800 km
west, into west-central South Dakota (Methods). Almost all this
movement occurred when plant sciences were in their infancy.
The change in the location entailed large shifts in growing
conditions. The six panels of Fig. 1 display the main features of
the changing geographic distribution of the North American
wheat crop across latitude; longitude; annual, January, and July
temperature norms; and annual precipitation norms. The series
cover the period 1839­2007, using county-level information from
United States and Canada. The distributions summarized in Fig.
1 weight the fixed county-level geoclimatic characteristics by
output in each locality at each date (Methods).
Fig. 1A summarizes the changing longitude of wheat pro-
duction in North America over roughly 170 y. The median pro-
duction shifted west by 21° of longitude (nearly 1,800 km)
between 1839 and 1929, with little movement thereafter. By
1879, the median was beyond the extreme western boundary of
production in 1839. The median latitude of production (Fig. 1B)
was relatively constant until the 1890s, when the northern Plains
and the Canadian Prairies began to enter cultivation. The me-
dian latitude of production in 1929 was near the northern fringe
of production (the 95% line) in 1839. The northernmost one-
quarter of production (reflected by the 75% line) moved north
by 8° of latitude (>880 km) between 1839 and 1929.
Fig.1C­Fquantifiesthechangesinclimaticconditionsassociated
with these geographic shifts in production. In 1839 median pro-
duction took place in an environment with a (1941­1970) norm of
nearly100cmofprecipitation(Fig.1C).In2007,medianproduction
took place on land with a norm of less than 50 cm of precipitation;
this environment was drier than virtually any place growing wheat in
the United States or Canada in 1839. Almost all the changes in the
distributionofproduction,asmeasuredbyannualprecipitation,had
occurred by 1929. In that year the marginal fringe (the 10% line)
with 35 cm or less of precipitation produced about one-fifth more
wheat than North America's total output in 1839. The range of
annual moisture conditions widened substantially, as indicated by
the growing spread between the 10% and 90% lines. Data on pre-
cipitationinJanuaryand July (Figs. S1andS2) showthat thedecline
was apparent across the year, creating an array of challenges in new
production zones. As an indicator of the extent of the changes, the
driest 10% of North American production moved from areas with
7.8 cm of rain in July in 1839 to areas that averaged 0.9 cm in 1889.
The median annual and January temperature norms fell by 3.7 °C
and 5.9 °C, respectively, between 1839 and 2007 (Fig. 1 D and E).
The range of temperature conditions widened greatly, with a pro-
nounced movement into colder domains. The 90­10 percentile
differential in annual temperature doubled, from 6.3 to 13.1 °C,

during the past 170 y. Again, most of the change occurred before
the dawn of modern plant sciences. Focusing on annual temper-
ature norms, the coldest 10% of production occurred at 8.4 °C in
1839 but at 1.6 °C in 1929. The fall in winter temperature was
more extreme (Fig. 1E). For the coldest 10% of production as
measured by January temperature, the norm in 1839 was -5.1 °C
but in 1929 was -17.7 °C, a fall of 12.6 °C. In 1929 much more
wheat was grown in places where the January temperature norm
averaged less than -17 °C than was grown in all of North
America in 1839, a date when little wheat was produced in areas
with a January temperature norm as low as -7 °C. The colder
production locations also have tended to be drier. The pro-
duction-weighted correlation coefficient between annual tem-
perature and precipitation was 0.70 in 1839, 0.54 in 1929, and
0.51 in 2007. Wheat cultivation spread to a wider range of cli-
matic conditions, but a positive association between temperature
and precipitation remained.
The changes have not been limited to production moving into
places with colder climates, but the expansion in hot areas has
been swamped in our figures by the much greater geographical
shift into cold areas. Fig. 1F shows that, although the median
July temperature norm in the wheat-growing area declined, the
July temperature in the area supporting the warmest one-quarter
of production increased. In 1839, 5.1 million bushels of wheat
were produced in areas with a July temperature norm of 26 °C or
hotter. By 1929 more than 192 million bushels were produced
under such conditions.

remind us of the revolutionary accomplishments that he and
other agronomists made during the past 70 y. However, in 1944,
when Borlaug started his work for the Rockefeller Foundation in
Mexico, there already was a long history of agriculturalists who
had successfully improved wheat to meet climatic conditions.
Biological Innovation to Adapt to Environmental Challenges. Wheat
cultivation was introduced into Mexico in 1521, but it did not
appear in the territory that would become Canada and the
United States until 1602 (10). Discovering wheats suitable for
new areas was a reoccurring struggle. Farmers in eastern Canada
and New England continuously experimented to find cold-tol-
erant and pest-resistant wheats (11). In the more temperate
Middle colonies, the cultivars (cultivated varieties) transplanted
from Western Europe fared better. However, the challenges
were particularly acute when pioneers moved wheat cultivation
westward onto the northern Prairies, Great Plains, and Pacific
Coast. All these regions eventually became major wheat suppli-
ers, but only after farmers learned to overcome climatic con-
ditions far different from those prevailing to the East and in
Western Europe. The initial attempts to grow traditional wheat
cultivars frequently failed.
The experiences of the Selkirk colonists who settled near Lake
Winnipeg offer an example. The winter wheat, first tried in 1811­
1812, failed. Successive crops of spring wheat also succumbed to
drought, freezing, and insects. To obtain sufficient seed for the
1820 crop, a band of Selkirk settlers had to trek more than 2,000
km (round trip) to Prairie du Chien on the upper Mississippi
River during the dead of winter. After about a decade of hungry
times, the colony began to sustain itself (12). The prolonged
troubles of the Selkirk colonists represented a clear case of
settlers leapfrogging beyond the limits of their climatic knowl-
edge. However, even when settlers inched west in a more orderly
fashion, the challenge of adapting was daunting. In the 1840s,
attempts to grow soft winter wheat on the Wisconsin Prairie
failed repeatedly, and wheat culture succeeded only after farm-
ers switched to a new hard spring wheat cultivar (13).
The Great Plains were depicted as the "Great American
Desert" and were considered incapable of supporting agricul-
ture. The first waves of settlers from the humid East and Mid-
west moved into the High Plains during the relatively wet years
of the 1880s. These farmers, along with railroad and government
officials, significantly miscalculated the climatic obstacles that
had to be overcome (14). Success required decades of experi-
mentation and frequently depended on knowledge and cultivars
introduced by immigrants from frigid and arid locales of Eurasia.
The spread of wheat cultivation across the Great Plains and
Canadian Prairies was made possible by mechanization and the
extension of railroads. A host of mechanical innovations cut in
half the labor required to produce a unit of wheat between 1840
and 1913. In the 1860s, railroad builders began expanding into
this region; by 1913, about 133,000 km of track in the Plains and
Prairies served to link farmers to expanding distant markets (15,
16). However, the expansion of wheat cultivation also depended
on the introduction and breeding of hard red winter and spring
wheats that were entirely new to North America. During the late
19th century, the premier hard spring wheat cultivated in North
America was Red Fife (which probably made its way from Eastern
Europe to Ontario via Scotland). According to the standard ac-
count, David and Jane Fife of Otonabee, ON, selected and in-
creased the grain stock from a single wheat plant grown on their
farm in 1842. It was not introduced into the United States until
the mid-1850s. Red Fife was the first hard spring wheat grown in
North America and became the basis for the spread of wheat into
Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Canadian Prairies (13).
Another notable breakthrough was the introduction of Turkey
wheat, which, like Red Fife, allowed production to shift into more
marginal environments (SI Text). This hard red winter cultivar
was especially well suited to the harsh growing conditions of the
southern wheat belt. The standard histories credit German
Mennonites, who migrated from southern Russia to Kansas, with
importing Turkey in 1873. This transfer was far from haphazard,
because local railroads recruited these migrants for their knowl-
edge of farming in such environments (ref. 16, pp. 88­89.). Fur-
thermore, before departing for Kansas, the Mennonites tediously
selected high-quality seed considered suitable for the new lands.
Earlier Kansas settlers experimented with soft winter cultivars
common to the eastern states, but these wheats proved unreliable
in the cold winters and hot, dry summers. Tests at the Kansas
Agricultural Experiment Station (AES) demonstrated Turkey's
superiority and helped popularize the wheat. In 1919, Turkey-type
wheat made up more than 80% of the wheat acreage in Nebraska
and Kansas and nearly 70% of the wheat acreage in Colorado and
Oklahoma (17, 18 and ref. 19, pp. 208­218). At this time, S. C.
Salmon, a leading US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
breeder, concluded that, without Turkey cultivars, "The wheat
crop of Kansas today would be no more than half what it is, and
the farmers of Nebraska, Montana and Iowa would have no
choice but to grow spring wheat" (20).
In both Canada and the United States many varietal innova-
tions were the result of government investments. In 1886 Parlia-
ment created the Canadian Federal Experiment Station system.
Its most acclaimed breeder, William Saunders, commenced
a systematic program of hybridizing high-quality cultivars with
early-maturing wheats introduced from around the world. In 1903
his son, Charles Saunders, took over the work at the Dominion
Experimental Farm, near Ottawa. The most valuable result of
their combined research efforts was Marquis, a cross between Red
Fife and Red Calcutta, a very early wheat from India. Released in
1909, Marquis was an immediate success and accounted for about
90% of Canada's wheat acreage in 1920 (21). After testing the
wheat in its network of experiment stations, the USDA released
the spring wheat in 1912­1913. By 1919, this cultivar accounted
for 17% of United States acreage, and its range stretched from
Washington State to northern Illinois (19). The rapid spread of
Marquis was not an isolated case. Around 1900, Mark Alfred
Carleton, the USDA's most prominent wheat breeder and plant
explorer, introduced scores of cultivars from the Russian Empire.
He explicitly was seeking cultivars that thrived in harsh environ-
ments. After proving drought and rust resistant in controlled
tests, several durum introductions diffused rapidly in Minnesota
and the Dakotas (13, 22).
Table 1, which lists a number of important new wheat culti-
vars, hints at the growing importance of public breeding (18, 23,
24). (The distinction between the public and private sectors is
not precise, because breeders in both sectors use germplasm
from the other.) In 1919, 27% of the wheat acreage in the United
States was planted in cultivars introduced or bred by the public
sector, and almost all Canadian wheat was a product of gov-
ernment breeders (ref. 19, pp. 208­218, and ref. 21, pp. 73­74).
Public breeding activities in the United States increased during
much of the 20th century. In 2008 varietal surveys of United
States and Canadian wheat (SI Text) indicate that roughly 84%
of wheat acreage is planted to cultivars bred by the public sector.
Improvements in breeding technologies along with environ-
mental and economic factors have accelerated the rate of turn-
over of wheat cultivars. The surveys show that the median
vintage of modern wheats is 12 y. By comparison, the 1919 me-
dian vintage was about 3 decades. Changes in technologies have
allowed farmers to adopt seeds tailored to narrower geoclimatic
niches; none of the more than 300 cultivars reported in the 2008
surveys accounted for more than 6% of total United States and
Canadian wheat acreage. Breeding advances in the United States
and Mexico accelerated the evolution of wheat germplasm and
the plant's adaptability to more varied conditions.
Home of the Green Revolution. Although wheat appeared early in
Mexico, the crop always was secondary to maize. By the early
1940s, rust diseases were taking a heavy toll, and national pro-
duction accounted for less than one-half of consumption. In 1943,
the Mexican government together with the Rockefeller Founda-
tion established a wheat-breeding program, hiring Norman Bor-
laug as the chief breeder the following year. His invention of
shuttle breeding (whereby researchers took seed grown at high
elevations over the summer to grow at low elevations over the
winter and then planted the resulting seed at high elevations the
following spring, and then repeated the process) allowed Borlaug
to cut the breeding time in half and develop plants adapted to
a wider range of environmental conditions. Borlaug bred a series
of early-ripening, fertility-responsive, rust-resistant cultivars, but

these were prone to lodging (the bending and breaking of the
stems). Building on the work of Orville Vogel at the Washington
State AES, Borlaug began to produce semidwarf lines in 1954
based on a cross of Norin 10 (from Japan) and Brevor (from the
Washington State AES). The resulting plants had strong straw,
high yield potential, and good rust resistance, including pro-
tection against the new stem rust race, 15b, which was ravaging
North America. A succession of new lines began to diffuse rap-
idly, increasing production and transforming Mexico into a net
exporter by the early 1960s. With the transfer of the Mexican
seeds and breeding approaches to India and Pakistan, the Green
Revolution was born (25­27).
Table 2, which incorporates data on Mexican production,
highlights the role of the Green Revolution in pushing production
into hotter and drier zones. In 1929, Mexico accounted for only 1%
of the sum of United States, Canadian, and Mexican output, so
Mexico's inclusion has little effect on the overall North American
distributions. However, its share grew about fourfold by 1969 and
even more by 2007, so its inclusion in the latter years is important,
particularly for the distributions of latitude, temperature, and
precipitation. The row in Table 2 marking the southern 10% of
production shows that the latitude of the distribution including
Mexico in 2007 was 1.37° south (about 150 km) of that excluding
Mexico. The row showing 90% by annual temperature quantifies
the movement into hotter domains. The temperature line for the
hottest 10% of North American production including Mexico in-
creased by 2.39 °C between 1929 and 2007, 1.39 °C higher than with
Mexico excluded. Finally, the row for the lowest 10% of wheat
production measured by annual precipitation shows a greater ex-
pansion into drier areas. Including Mexico substantially widens the
conditions under which North American wheat was grown after
1929, essentially continuing trends that had been underway over
the previous century.
Adaptation. Adjusting to climate change will require shifts in the
location of production along with changes in germplasm, sowing
dates, tillage practices, and water management at specific loca-
tions (28, 29). We can obtain a sense of the significance of past
adjustments by examining the shifts from spring to winter wheat
cultivars. When the upper Midwest, the northern Great Plains,
and the Canadian Prairies were first settled, hard red spring
wheat generally was the only reliable option. Wherever feasible,
farmers prefer to grow winter wheat instead of spring wheat.
Winter wheat generally offers significantly higher yields and is
less subject to damage from insects and diseases, but in colder
climates it suffers high losses to winterkill.
Agronomists have long recognized that the development of
hearty winter cultivars that could be grown in harsher climates was
an historic achievement. Our detailed data on production and cul-
tivars allow us to quantify the extent of the change. Fig. 2 maps the
North American spring­winter wheat frontiers for 1869 and 1929

(by regression analysis). Spring wheat output generally exceeded
winter wheat output in the counties north of the estimated frontier,
and winter wheat dominated south of the frontier. Between 1869
and 1929 scientific advances allowed winter wheat production to
spread northward across most of Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and
Oklahoma as well as into large regions of Illinois, Wisconsin, and
Colorado.Theareabetweenthe 1869 and1929 spring­winterwheat
frontiers accounted for more than one-fifth of all North American
wheatoutputin1929.Since1929,winterwheat hasbeenadaptedfor
large areas in South Dakota and Montana (30).
This displacement of one wheat type by another represented one
of many ways that farmers used technology to adapt to climatic
conditions. Within each class of wheat, farmers generally have
adopted later planting dates during the 20th century (31, 32).
Mechanical technologies allow more rapid and timely performance
of tillage operations. Low-tillage practices and irrigation have be-
come increasingly common. In addition, farmers in many areas
have increased efficiency by substituting other crops for wheat.
Because of climate change, some areas presumably will decrease
or cease wheat production, whereas other areas, particularly in
northern Canada and Alaska, are expected to enter production.
Although the anticipated movement in the wheat frontier is sub-
stantial, it is unlikely to be as great as the past geographic shifts in
production. The difficulties in extending the transportation in-
frastructure to facilitate future shifts also appear less imposing
than those overcome to open the Plains and Prairies. The chal-
lenging problems deal with adapting growing practices and creating
improved cultivars.
Table 3, which relates the predicted changes in annual mean
climatic conditions to the current geographic variation across five
sample locations, offers some guidance on agricultural adaptability.
The table reports the baseline (1981­1990) annual mean tempera-
ture and precipitation (baseline climate data) and the conditions in
2091­2100 as estimated in the high-resolution atmospheric general
circulation model (33, 34) used by the World Bank, among others.
Columbus, OH, serves as useful point of comparison, because its
1981­1990 conditions closely approximated the annual mean cli-
matic conditions that existed near the geographic center of the
distribution of North American wheat production in 1839 (35). The
last two columns of the table, which show the differences between
the Columbus baseline and the other four locations, illustrate the
widearrayofclimaticconditionstowhichwheathasbeenadaptedin
North America during the past 170 y. Even with the predicted an-
nual mean temperature by 2100, farmers near Edmonton, AB, and
Dickerson, ND, will confront substantially colder conditions than
eastern wheat growers faced circa 1839. Even with the anticipated
increase in precipitation, the northern farmers will have to make do
with about half the precipitation that the earlier generation of
eastern farmers received. The predicted changes in Dodge City, KS,
andCiudadObregón,Sonora,Mexico,suggest bothhotteranddrier
conditions than were common at the center of North American
production in 1839 (again, a climate akin to that in Columbus, OH,
in the baseline period). Note, however, that the difference in tem-
perature between Columbus and Ciudad Obregón was roughly six
times the increase predicted in the latter city by 2100. Wheat pro-
duction is sensitive to seasonal fluctuations in weather conditions,
which probably will become more variable in the future and which
are not captured by annual mean data (29). Nevertheless, the his-
torical record of adapting wheat cultivation to areas with widely
varying climates is impressive.
Conclusions
During the 19th and 20th centuries, new technologies allowed
North American farmers to push wheat cultivation repeatedly
into environments once thought too arid, too variable, and too
harsh to farm. Most notably, the median precipitation norm of the
1929 distribution of North American wheat production was one-
half that of the 1839 distribution--that is, about 50 fewer cm/y.
For the most part, the settlement process required adapting cul-
tivation to colder and more arid regions, not to hotter climates
as predicted in the future. Farming with less water is more of a
problem if the temperature also is hotter. However, biological
innovations also were crucial to the expansion of production in
hot-arid areas such as Texas, Oklahoma, central California, and
northern Mexico. The currently predicted changes during the
next century will, in a sense, reverse the predominant historical
path of the past two centuries by creating a warmer and wetter
environment in the Plains and Prairies that will partially approach
the conditions that existed in the Middle Atlantic region when it
constituted the North American wheat belt.
There will be enormous challenges to the agricultural sector
associated with impending climate changes. Public and private
research will be crucial to address the new environmental re-
alities, as it was in facilitating the past movement in production.
Given the challenges ahead and the long lags between invest-
ments in research and their payoffs, reinvigorating public sup-
port for research to promote agricultural adaptability should be
a high policy priority (36).
Methods
Production Data. A primary task was to construct a consistent local-level wheat
production series for North America. We extracted county-level United States
wheat production data (37, 38) and www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/
2007/index.asp. Canadian data are from refs. 39 and 40 supplemented by
Fig. 2. Shift in the North American spring­winter wheat frontier, 1869­1929.

sundry provincial sources to fill gaps in the Census data between 1950 and
1976. To link the output data for the period before 1978, we combine the
Canadian 1850 production with the United States production for 1849, and so
forth. The number of local entities varies over time; in 1929, for example, we
record data on 3,070 counties in the United States and 216 units in Canada.
We have wheat production data for every 10 y from 1839­1978 and for every
5 y thereafter. We base our 1839 Canadian output estimate on data for Upper
Canada (Ontario) in 1842 and Lower Canada (Quebec) in 1844.
For the United States, we linked production to each county's location
based on its 1970 population centroid from ref. 41. For Canada the data
are less standardized, and the local units reported by official sources in-
clude counties, census divisions, and agricultural districts depending on
the province and year. We linked production to a fixed location with each
local unit.
Climate Norm Data. The geoclimatic variables reflect average 1941­1970 con-
ditions in each county or agricultural district as recorded by the US National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in ref. 41 or the Canadian Atmo-
spheric Environment Service (42). These climate norms largely predate the
more recent climate changes associated with the global warming.
Mexican Data. We do not include Mexico in our primary long-run analysis
because of a paucity of data until 1929 and Mexico's relatively low wheat
output for most of the period. Production data for 1929 are from ref. 43,
those for 1969 are from ref. 44, and those for 2007 are from Sistema de
Información Agroalimentaria de Consulta, www.siap.gob.mx. Weather
norms are from ref. 45.
Baseline Climate Data. The baseline (1981­1990) annual temperatures and
precipitation for Columbus, OH, Dickerson, ND, Edmonton, AB, Fort Dodge,
KS, and Ciudad Obregón are from World Weather Records, http://dss.ucar.
edu/datasets/ds570.1/.
Regression Analysis. Fig. 2 connects the latitude at which spring wheat
output equaled winter wheat output for each longitude between 87° W and
105° W. The points are derived from regressions of the proportion of spring
wheat in total county wheat production in the 1869 and 1929 for United
States and Canada; observations are binned by degree of longitude.
