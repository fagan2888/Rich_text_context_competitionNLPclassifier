Violence against children continues to grow as a salient
issue in national and international public health and
public policy discussions.1,2 However, epidemiology to
accurately describe the problem and track trends continues to
be a stumbling block in the United States and elsewhere. Avail-
able data have not resolved disagreements about whether
physical abuse of children in the United States has been
increasing3-5 or decreasing6 or whether bullying is an
epidemic7,8 or on the decline.9 A recent National Academies
Press report pointed to problems in the epidemiology of child
maltreatment and called for a "high-quality, population-
based,epidemiologicalsurveillancesystemthatdrawsonmul-
tiple data sources."10
The most important recent initiative to improve child mal-
treatment epidemiology is a joint effort of the US Department
of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
initiated in 2008 entitled the National Survey of Children's Ex-
posure to Violence (NatSCEV).11 Repeated assessments have
occurred at 3-year intervals,12 in 2011 and now in 2014. The
availability of this surveillance system means that policy mak-
ers and health care professionals can have current informa-
tion on prevalences and trends. The NatSCEV provides ongo-
ingnationalestimatesofawiderangeofviolenceagainstyouth,
including the only national source of information about crimes
against children younger than 12 years that are not reported
to authorities.
IMPORTANCE It is important to estimate the burden of and trends for violence, crime, and
abuse in the lives of children.
OBJECTIVE To provide health care professionals, policy makers, and parents with current
estimates of exposure to violence, crime, and abuse across childhood and at different
developmental stages.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence
(NatSCEV) includes a representative sample of US telephone numbers from August 28, 2013,
to April 30, 2014. Via telephone interviews, information was obtained on 4000 children 0 to
17 years old, with information about exposure to violence, crime, and abuse provided by
youth 10 to 17 years old and by caregivers for children 0 to 9 years old.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Exposure to violence, crime, and abuse using the Juvenile
Victimization Questionnaire.
RESULTS In total, 37.3% of youth experienced a physical assault in the study year, and 9.3% of
youth experienced an assault-related injury. Two percent of girls experienced sexual assault
or sexual abuse in the study year, while the rate was 4.6% for girls 14 to 17 years old. Overall,
15.2% of children and youth experienced maltreatment by a caregiver, including 5.0% who
experienced physical abuse. In total, 5.8% witnessed an assault between parents. Only 2
significant rate changes could be detected compared with the last survey in 2011, namely,
declines in past-year exposure to dating violence and lifetime exposure to household theft.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children and youth are exposed to violence, abuse, and crime
in varied and extensive ways, which justifies continued monitoring and prevention efforts.

Methods
Participants
The NatSCEV 2014 was designed to obtain up-to-date inci-
dence and prevalence estimates of a wide range of childhood
violence, crime, and abuse. It consists of a national sample of
4000 children and youth 0 to 17 years old from August 28, 2013,
toApril30,2014.Studyinterviewswereconductedoverthetele-
phonebytheemployeesofanexperiencedsurveyresearchfirm.
Telephone interviewing is a cost-effective method11,13 that has
been demonstrated to be comparable to in-person interviews
in data quality, even for reports of exposure to violence, psy-
chopathology, and other sensitive topics.14-19
Sample
A nationwide sample was obtained using the following 4
sources: (1) an address-based sample (ABS) of households from
which cell phone and residential numbers could be dialed, (2)
a prescreened sample of households with children from re-
cent national random-digit-dialed surveys, (3) a listed land-
line sample (with a known child in the household based on
commercial lists), and (4) cell phone numbers drawn from a
targeted random-digit-dialed sample frame. This combina-
tion of sampling frames was an effort to increase nationwide
coverage of households, including those served only by cell
phone, while efficiently reaching households with children to
obtain the desired number of completed interviews. Weights
were developed to account for differential probability of se-
lection within and across the sampling frames and to adjust
for nonresponse.
Recruitment
The ABS respondents received an advance letter for the study
withahouseholdinformationformtodetermineeligibilityand
willingness to participate in the study. In return, the house-
hold would receive a $5 check and soon be called to conduct
the telephone interview for an additional $20.
Procedure
A short interview was conducted with an adult caregiver (usu-
ally a parent) to obtain family demographic information. One
child was then randomly selected from all eligible children liv-
ing in the household. If the selected child was 10 to 17 years
old, the main telephone interview was conducted with the
child. Otherwise, the interview was conducted with the care-
giver who was most familiar with the child's daily routine and
experiences. Verbal informed consent was obtained from the
caregiver and youth, if interviewed.
Respondents were promised complete confidentiality and
were paid $20 for their participation. The interviews, averag-
ing 60 minutes in length, were conducted in English or Span-
ish.Availableparticipantswithoutsuchlanguageskillswereex-
cluded from the study. Respondents who disclosed a situation

cal member of the research team, trained in telephone crisis

cally. All procedures were authorized by the Institutional Re-
view Board of the University of New Hampshire.
Measurement
Information on children's exposure to violence was collected
using the 2013 version of the Juvenile Victimization
Questionnaire20-22 withquestionson53formsofoffensesagainst
youth (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement) covering the following
6 general areas: conventional crime, child maltreatment, peer
andsiblingoffenses,sexualassault,witnessingandindirectex-
posure to violence, and Internet offenses. Follow-up questions
for survey items gathered additional information about inci-
dents,includingperpetratorcharacteristics,theuseofaweapon,
whether injury resulted, and whether the exposure type oc-
curredinthesameincidentasanothertype.Theitemsandtheir
follow-upquestionswereusedtoconstructaggregatetypes(eg,
anyphysicalassault)andrescoredtypes(eg,physicalassaultby
a nonsibling peer) (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was conducted using a software program (STATA
13; StataCorp LP), and sampling weights were incorporated by
means of the program's set of "svy" commands for complex
survey data. For Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the 2014 overall pro-
portions of children experiencing each type of episode in the
past year and over their lifetime were calculated, and com-
parisons by age and sex were conducted using cross-
tabulations and 2 tests. Comparisons for overall past-year and
lifetime rates between the 2014 and 2011 estimates (the last 2
columns of the tables) were made by pooling the data for both
years, calculating the proportion of children experiencing each
episode type by year and then conducting significance test-
ing on the differences between the 2 years' proportions. The
JuvenileVictimizationQuestionnaireusedinNatSCEV2014in-
cluded several new items not included in the earlier survey.
Rates shown for the NatSCEV 2014 reflect the incorporation
of the new items, but comparisons with rates from 2011 were
based only on items that were used in both surveys.
Table 6 summarizes the likelihood that children who ex-
perienced one aggregate type of episode would experience an-
other episode of a different type. Odds ratios listed in Table 6
were calculated using binomial logistic regressions that con-
trolled for age.
At a Glance
· We used a nationally representative sample of US telephone
numbers from August 28, 2013, to April 30, 2014, and gathered
information on exposure to violence, crime, and abuse among
4000 children 0 to 17 years old.
· More than one-third of the youth experienced a physical assault
in the past year.
· One in 10 experienced an assault-related physical injury.
· One in 20 girls 14 to 17 years old experienced sexual assault or
abuse.
· There were significant declines since 2011 in past-year exposure
to dating violence and lifetime exposure to household theft.

Response Rates and Nonresponse Analysis
The response rates differed across the 4 sampling frames.
Among the completed interviews, 1011 were from the ABS
frame. Of these, 651 were from those who replied to the study
mailing (American Association for Public Opinion Research re-
sponse rates [RR], 52.7% for RR3 and 67% for RR4), and 360
were from those with matched telephone numbers on file
(15.1% for RR3 and 22.9% for RR4).24 In total, 520 completed
interviews were from the prescreened sample (22.1% for RR3
and 30.6% for RR4), 2443 were from the listed landline sample
(14.7% for RR3 and 21.7% for RR3), and 26 were from the cell

phone random-digit-dialed sample (9.7% for RR3 and 14.2%
for RR4). A large fraction (31.5%) of the 1011 respondents from
the ABS frame represented cell phone­only households, con-
firming our expectation that the ABS sampling design effec-
tively captured this type of hard-to-reach household.
Nonresponse analyses were conducted to assess poten-
tial differences between study respondents and individuals
whorefusedparticipationorwhocouldnotbecontacted.Over-
all, the response propensity modeling25 suggested that adults
who refused to grant permission for the youth interview were
more likely to come from households with more educated par-
ents, healthier children, higher income, and less school or
neighborhood violence or from families with children 10 to 12
years old (ie, individuals who were typically at lower risk).
These differences were rectified through weight calibration.
We also compared prevalence rates for 6 major types of of-
fenses (property crime, peer or sibling offenses, sexual of-
fenses, sexual assault, physical assault, and maltreatment)
across the sampling frames. There were no significant differ-
ences in any rates across the sampling frames, except for a
slightly lower rate of peer or sibling offenses in the ABS frame
relative to the listed landline sample, likely due to the some-
what younger age and fewer siblings in the ABS frame. Given
thatmuchofthenonresponsewasowingtotheinabilitytocon-
tact respondents after numerous call attempts, we also com-
pared exposure rates among respondents whom we were able
to interview early in the contact process with respondents who
were interviewed later. Except for higher rates of sexual as-
sault among the later responders, who were somewhat older
youth on average and thus expected to have higher rates, there
were no significant differences in prevalences reported. These
analyses and the adjustments made through weighting give us
confidence that nonresponse has not biased the survey.
Assault
More than one-third of all youth (37.3%) experienced a physi-
cal assault during the study year, primarily at the hands of sib-
lings and peers (Table 1). An assault resulting in an injury oc-
curred to 9.3%. An assault by an adult occurred to 5.1%. We
measured general bullying­type behaviors, without limiting

them to those that involved a pattern of repetition or a power
imbalance between the perpetrator and target, characteris-
tics that are frequently used to define traditional bullying.26
Physical intimidation occurred to 12.6% and relational aggres-
sion to 35.6% of children and youth surveyed.
Assaults occurred to more boys than girls (41.6% vs 33.0%).
Boyshadparticularlydisproportionatelevelsofassaultbyadults
(6.9% vs 3.3%), nonsibling peer assault (20.6% vs 10.4%), and
nonsexual assault to the genitals (7.7% vs 2.4%). Physical in-
timidation was highest for children younger than 10 years, and
relational aggression was highest for children 10 to 13 years old.
Internet harassment was highest for children 14 to 17 years old.
The overall assault rate for 2014 was down 3.2 percentage
points compared with 2011, and 15 of 16 specific forms of as-
sault or intimidation also showed declines. However, only one
of the 2011 to 2014 declines (dating violence) was statistically
significant.
Sexual Assault
Five percent experienced a sexual offense in the past year, and
1.4% experienced a sexual assault (Table 2). Sexual assault ex-
cludes sexual harassment and comprises attempted and com-
pleted rape, plus contact sex offenses by adults and peers. It
is equivalent to contact sexual abuse. Girls 14 to 17 years old
were the group at highest risk, 16.4% of whom experienced a
sexual offense, and 4.6% experienced sexual assault or sexual
abuse in the past year. Among this group, 4.4% had an at-
tempted or completed rape, 11.5% experienced sexual harass-
ment, and 8.5% were exposed to an unwanted Internet sexual
solicitation in the past year.
Sexual assault is a form of childhood violence that is fre-
quently measured in lifetime prevalence. The NatSCEV 2014
lifetime estimates for youth 14 to 17 years old (who have al-
most completed childhood) by sex are listed in the far right col-
umns in Table 2. In total, 14.3% of the older girls and 6.0% of

assault by a known adult occurred to 4.3% of girls and 1.1% of
boys.
Aggregatesexualassaultdeclinednonsignificantlyby1.0%
from 2011 to 2014. Ten of eleven individual categories de-
clined by small amounts, but none of the differences were sta-
tistically significant.
Child Maltreatment
Child maltreatment comprises physical abuse, emotional
abuse, neglect, and custodial interference. Such maltreat-
ment occurred to 15.2% of the sample in the past year (Table 3).
The lifetime rate of child maltreatment for the oldest sub-
group (14-17 years) was 38.1%. The rates of physical abuse by
a caregiver were 5.0% for the full sample in the past year and
18.1% for the group 14 to 17 years old in their lifetime. The rates
of emotional abuse by a caregiver were 9.3% for the full sample
and 23.9% for the group 14 to 17 years old in their lifetime. The
rates of neglect were 5.1% in the past year for the full sample
and 18.4% over their lifetime for the group 14 to 17 years old.
There were no significant sex differences. Physical abuse was
lowest for children younger than 6 years, and emotional abuse
was highest for children 14 to 17 years old. There was a non-
significant increase of 1.4% in past-year maltreatment since
2011. Two of the specific categories (physical abuse and emo-
tional abuse) had nonsignificant increases, and neglect had a
nonsignificant decrease.
Property Crime
Property crime is a reality for young people, as it is for adults,
but is rarely discussed by child safety and protection offi-
cials. We measured nonsibling robbery (ie, something taken
from your person) (occurring to 6.5% of the sample), vandal-
ism (occurring to 7.4% of the sample), and theft (occurring to
7.8% of the sample) during the past year (Table 4). There were
no sex differences. Theft was more common among youth 14
to 17 years old. There were no significant differences between
reports of property crime in 2014 and 2011.
Witnessing and Indirect Exposures
Almost one-quarter of the sample (24.5%) had witnessed vio-
lence in the past year in the family or in the community
(Table 5). A considerable portion (8.4%) had witnessed a fam-

ily assault, and 5.8% had witnessed a parent assault another
parent (or parental partner) in the past year. The lifetime rate
of witnessing any family assault among the oldest youth (14-17
years) was 32.0%, and 25.0% had witnessed a parent assault
another parent or partner in their lifetime. There were no sex
differences. Children 10 years and older had witnessed more
past-year violence than younger children.
Witnessing a community assault was also frequent, oc-
curring in 18.4% of all youth in the past year and in 57.9% over
their lifetime for the oldest youth. The rate of exposure to
shootings was 13.4% for this oldest group of youth over their
lifetime, while exposure to warfare was only 3.2%. Children
and youth had also been exposed to household theft (5.4%) in
the past year, and 6.1% had experienced a bomb threat in their
school. Aggregate witnessing violence in the past year in-
creased nonsignificantly by 1.6% since 2011. Household theft
decreased nonsignificantly by 2.5% for the past year, but the
lifetime decrease of 4.7% was statistically significant. School
threats increased nonsignificantly by 2.4%.
Multiple Exposures
It was common for children and youth to be exposed to mul-
tiple types of episodes over the course of a year. In total, 40.9%
had more than 1 direct experience of violence, crime, or abuse,
10.1% had 6 or more, and 1.2% had 10 or more. Overall, 60.8%
of the children had at least 1 form of direct exposure in the past
year. When witnessing and indirect exposures were com-
bined with direct exposure, 67.5% of the children had at least
1 exposure, 50.0% had more than 1 exposure, 15.0% had 6 or
more exposures, and 4.4% had 10 or more exposures. There
was no change from 2011 to 2014 in the number of partici-
pants with 6 or more exposures.
Exposures to violence were interrelated in such a way that
experiencing one type increased the likelihood of experienc-
ing other types as well. For example, having a past-year physi-
cal assault was associated with a 4.9 times higher likelihood
of experiencing a sexual offense and a 3.4 times higher likeli-
hood of caregiver maltreatment (Table 6). Risks for addi-
tional types of exposure were increased by a factor of 2 or more
for most past-year and lifetime exposures. Every combina-
tion had a significant risk amplification.
Trends Summary
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 list the percentage change for rates in
2014 compared with 2011 for past-year estimates and for life-
time estimates. There were only 2 significant changes in all 48
comparisons, namely, declines in past-year exposure to dat-
ing violence and lifetime exposure to household theft.
Discussion
This study provides updated estimates for exposure to a wide
variety of offenses, including violence, crime, and abuse. This
exposure is widespread in the short term and over the devel-
opmental life course.27-30 The NatSCEV approach to epidemi-
ology offers some unique features. It provides exposure in-
formationoverthefullcourseofchildhood.Itincludesoffenses
that were not reported to police or child protection services.
It illustrates the interrelationships among different forms of
violence, crime, and abuse. It provides estimates for a variety
of purposes using a mixture of categories that have relevance
to various policy domains.
For example, physicians interested in exposures result-
ing in injury may note that 9.3% of youth had such expo-
sures, while those interested more generally in aggression can
highlight the estimate of 37.3%. Sex offense policy makers
sometimes want to focus on sexual abuse by a known adult
(0.4% for the past year) or lifetime risk (4.3% for girls 14 to 17
years old). Alternatively, they may prefer to focus on sexual
assaults for the past year for all children (1.4%) or sexual as-
saults over their lifetime (14.3% for older girls).
An important component of the comprehensive ap-
proach in the NatSCEV is the ability to detect youth who may
experience large numbers of exposures. Ten percent of the
youth in the sample had 6 or more direct exposures in a single

year, a highly vulnerable segment of youth referred to as poly-
victims. They seem prone to many adversities, distress, and
other problems.31,32 Forty-one percent of youth had multiple
exposures in the past year. These findings highlight the num-
ber of children facing potentially trauma-inducing exposures
to violence, as well as the importance to physicians and other
child-serving professionals of inquiring about such expo-
sures and being prepared to help patients and families con-
cerning possible needs for protection and counseling.
Like all studies, the NatSCEV 2014 has limitations. Vari-
ous factors may have prevented us from capturing the full ex-
tent of exposure. The families who could not be reached at
home or who refused cooperation for themselves or their chil-
dren may be families in which children have discrepant lev-
els of exposure compared with the cooperating families. For
many reasons, children may fail to disclose all their expo-
sures, and parents in particular may have incentive to con-
ceal their children's exposures or may not know about all of
them. This could explain the lower rates for the younger chil-
dren in many exposure categories. The screening questions for
exposures needed to be brief and may not have included
enough examples and details to trigger the memory of quali-
fying experiences. Some exposures, especially over a long time
span, may be forgotten or may have occurred before the
memory capacity of some of those experiencing them was well
formed.
In addition, the response rates for some segments of the
sampling design are low by historical standards but are as good
as or better than what is typical in national survey research.
Response rates to social science surveys have been steadily de-
creasing over 3 decades.33-35
Low response rates do not necessarily increase the bias of
a sample. Studies25,36 have shown little association between
response rates and the size of nonresponse bias. Our nonre-
sponse analysis was reassuring. Despite these limitations, the
approachtakenbytheNatSCEVprovidesacomprehensivepor-
trait of children's exposure to violence, crime, and abuse.
Conclusions
Children and youth are exposed to violence, abuse, and crime
in varied and extensive ways, which justifies continued moni-
toring and prevention efforts.
