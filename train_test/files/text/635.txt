Determining the Amount of Help Used
by Disabled Elderly Persons at Home:
The Role of Coping Resources
Rachel F. Boaz and Jianxun Hu
Department of Economics, Graduate School, The City University of New York.
The purpose of this study is to quantify the effects of coping resources on the amount (hours) of help used by dis-
abled elderly persons in their home. The findings are based on the 1989 National Long-Term Care Survey. The dis-
tribution of help-hours is very skewed, mirroring the skewness of limitations in physical and cognitive functioning.
Controlling for these limitations, the most important coping resources are the combinations of helpers who join
forces, and coresidence with a helper. The effect of helpers' networks is large and consistent across marital status
and living arrangements. The networks are more extensive for married than for unmarried persons. In reference to
persons who rely only on nonrelatives: (a) a network of a spouse and children enables a married person to have 40
additional weekly hours of help, (b) a network of children and others enables an unmarried person to have 29 addi-
tional help-hours per week if he/she coresides with other adults and 10 additional weekly help-hours if he/she does
not. The issue of concern for public policy is whether such family networks will be preserved and, if not, how to ob-
tain thefunds for the alternative of sufficient paid help in the community.
THE growth in the number of very old Americans can be
expected to increase the number of persons who de-
pend on others for long-term assistance with daily activities
of personal care and household tasks. At present, most of
these individuals are living in the community and are rely-
ing mainly on informal help at home. Their ability to do so
depends on the community resources available to help cope
with disability. This study assesses the effects of economic
and social resources that make continued living at home
possible.
Informal help depends on the availability of family
helpers and on sharing living quarters with them. The net-
work of kin relationship upon which elderly people rely is
an outcome of life events that usually took place many
years earlier and are beyond their control when they are old
and disabled. The extent to which children and other rela-
tives are legally obligated to provide helping services is not
clear. Bulcroft, Van Leynseele, and Borgatta (1989) sur-
veyed the existing state laws on filial responsibility in 1988
and reported substantial interstate differences in the con-
cept of who is expected to support elderly relatives and to
what extent. In fact, as Stone and Kemper (1989) show,
fewer than one in four sons and daughters of disabled par-
ents are active caregivers at any point in time. But the
amount of help used at home also depends on living ar-
rangements over which an elderly person may have some
control.
A study by the Congressional Budget Office (1988), de-
scribing changes in American living arrangements, sug-
gests that both elderly persons and their children prefer to
live apart. Specifically, elderly persons prefer to live with a
spouse only or, when the marriage dissolves, to live alone.
Between 1960 and 1984, the percentage living alone in-
creased from 18.6 to 30.6 and the percentage living with a
spouse in a two-person household rose from 36.8 to 45.0;
but the percentage of elderly individuals sharing living
quarters with an adult other than a spouse declined from
44.6 to 24.4. According to a survey for the Commonwealth
Fund Commission on Elderly People Living Alone (Harris
and Associates, 1986), of all elders living alone in 1986, 86
percent explicitly stated their preference for this arrange-
ment. Data from the 1990 Census show a further decline, to
14.7 percent, in the proportion of elderly persons living
with adults other than a spouse (National Institute on Aging,
1993).
However, functional limitations and disability may
change these preferences. Boersch-Supan (1990) showed
that a transition to household sharing with helpers was due
to limitations in performing personal care activities. Bishop
(1986) determined that the probability of living alone de-
creased with disability in self-care and mobility. But
Worobey and Angel (1990) found that the preference of
unmarried elderly individuals for living alone was so
strong that, except for the most severely incapacitated,
those who suffered a decrement in functional capacity over
the 2-year period 1984-1986 continued to live alone. Kot-
likoff and Morris (1990), studying both elders and their
children, concluded that children were less willing than
their parents to share living quarters. In a multiperiod anal-
ysis, Boersch-Supan et al. (1992) showed that elderly in-
dividuals had a very strong preference for living with
children in order to avoid institutionalization and that high-
income elderly paid for help in the community to ease the
burden on their children.
The present study differs from previous studies in three
aspects. First, this study measures the amount of help by
S317
S318 BOAZAND HU
the number of hours of help; it is based on the National
Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) of 1989, which is the
first NLTCS to have information on hours of help. Studies
that were based on earlier NLTCS (e.g., Hanley and
Wiener, 1991; Sangl, 1992) measured the amount of help
by the number of days during which help was received, a
very imprecise measure of the amount of help-time. Sec-
ond, customarily, marital status and having children have
been specified as indicators of helpers. The present study
refines these indicators by specifying as helpers the differ-
ent combinations of relatives and nonrelatives on whom a
disabled person relies for help. Third, this study differs
from several other studies in its treatment of living arrange-
ments. Hanley and Wiener (1991) specified these arrange-
ments as an exogenous variable, and Sangl (1992) esti-
mated household composition as an exogenous variable.
Kemper (1992) excluded living arrangements from the re-
gression analysis although Kemper's (1990) model demon-
strated that living arrangements are an essential endogenous
variable. A recent study by Pezzin, Kemper, and
Reschovsky (1996) is the first published study that rectifies
this situation. It specifies living arrangements as an endoge-
nous variable affecting the amount of help provided to en-
rollees in the "channeling" experiment. But there is an in-
herent weakness in findings from such experiments; as
pointed out by Kane (1988), behavior that is induced by
time-limited experiments is very different from behavior
under nonexperimental circumstances. The present study
treats living arrangements as an endogenous determinant of
help in the community; its findings reflect behavior that can
be generalized to all elderly individuals needing long-term
care in the community.
This study quantifies the effects of coping resources on
the amount of help obtained by community-dwelling el-
derly persons. The findings point to the pivotal roles of in-
formal helpers and coresidence with family members in de-
termining the amount of in-home help received by
chronically disabled persons. The concern for public policy
is whether family networks can continue to provide as
much help in the future; and, if they cannot, where to ob-
tain the funds for the alternative of sufficient paid help to
prevent unmet need for help in the community.
Conceptual Issues
The amount of help that disabled elderly persons can use
is constrained by the resources at their disposal. These re-
sources are usually accumulated at an earlier phase of the
life cycle; when they are drawn down because of declining
health at life's end, they are not likely to be replenished.
Resources can take the forms of tangible and intangible
wealth. Tangible wealth can be exchanged (sold) for cash or
is available as a stream of annuitized income (e.g., Social
Security benefits and employer-provided pensions). This
wealth is based on bequest and worklife activity. Intangible
wealth is a fund of goodwill amassed during prime years
through the partnership with a spouse in marriage, the nur-
turing of children while raising them, and by maintaining
enduring close relationships with other relatives (siblings,
cousins, nephews and nieces) and friends; this wealth can
be used more efficiently when disabled elderly persons
share living quarters with their helpers than if they do not.
The stock of tangible wealth is subject to fluctuations due to
the vagaries of business conditions. The stock of intangible
wealth is also subject to fluctuations when caregivers have
their own health problems or have to allocate time to other
activities (e.g., raising children or market work); it is wiped
out in the case of estrangement or at the time of death. Pro-
longed use, due to the need for help over a long period, can
deplete these resources. The cost of long-term care is ex-
plicit when paid help is purchased and the tangible wealth is
drawn down. The cost of unpaid help is implicit in the strain
that such help puts on the relationship between the helpers
and the helped. The depletion of intangible wealth is ob-
served when informal caregivers stop being caregivers.
The regression model described below specifies the
amount (hours) of help as a function of available resources.
The amount of help is estimated separately for married and
unmarried persons because marriage provides a combina-
tion of helpers that is not available to unmarried individu-
als. For unmarried individuals a distinction is made be-
tween living with other adults and living alone because the
choice of sharing living quarters is a means to obtaining
more help and, therefore, is an endogenous choice. The
equation for each subset of unmarried persons is adjusted
for the endogenous choices of sharing living quarters and
receiving more help or living alone and forgoing additional
help. The difference between comparable coefficients of
these two subsets indicates the difference in the amount of
received help due to different modes of living.
Determinants of Help: Needs and Resources
This study is based on the 1989 National Long-Term
Care Survey (NLTCS). The survey was designed to repre-
sent functionally limited elderly persons (ages 65+) who, in
1989, reported needing or expecting to need assistance with
at least one activity of daily living (ADL) or instrumental
activity of daily living (IADL) for a period of 3 months or
longer. The ADLs are listed here in the sequence in which a
person is likely to lose the ability to perform them without
assistance: bathing, dressing, getting around the house, get-
ting to and using the toilet, continence, getting in and out of
bed, and eating, a sequence that is known as the Katz scale.
The IADLs consist of activities that enable individuals to
live in the community: housework, laundry, meal prepara-
tion, shopping for groceries, getting around outside the
house, managing money, using the phone, and taking oral
medicine. While Katz et al. (1963 and subsequent studies)
have shown that the ADLs follow a sequence that forms a
scale of accumulated disabilities, no similar scale has been
found for IADL disabilities. However, persons with more
than two ADL disabilities (i.e., with ADL disabilities in ad-
dition to bathing and dressing) are likely to need help with
IADLs. Since this study investigates in-home help, it is
based on the LTC-3 component of the NLTCS, which is a
sample of 4,463 community-dwelling disabled elderly per-
sons. The findings from this sample can be inferred to all
similarly disabled elderly who were living in the commu-
nity (not in nursing homes) in 1989. (A detailed description
of this dataset is provided by Manton, Corder, and Stallard,
1993a and 1993b.)
THE ROLE OF COPING RESOURCES S319
The aim of the study is to determine how the elderly use
their resources to satisfy their need for help. Hence, the rel-
evant dependent variable is the total amount of in-home
help that can be obtained to meet this need. In the 1989
NLTCS, the amount of help is measured by the number of
help hours per week. The weekly hours can exceed 168
when more than one helper is involved. The help needed to
perform ADLs and IADLs is unskilled in the sense that no
special training is required to be a helper. It can be secured
either by paying dollars or by relying on family and friends.
Both paid and unpaid help render the same type of services
and can equally satisfy the same kind of need. Each is pro-
cured with different resources: Cash income and tangible
assets are used to purchase the former; intangible wealth
and shared living quarters are conducive to obtaining the
latter. Differences in the availability of resources imply dif-
ferences in the total amount of in-home help. The regres-
sion analysis estimates the effects of coping resources
while controlling for different levels of need.
The need for help is specified by the number of ADL dis-
abilities and cognitive impairment. As shown by Katz et al.
(1963), the accumulation of disabilities is positively associ-
ated with need for help. NLTCS' evaluation of cognitive
function is based on the Short Portable Mental Health Sta-
tus Questionnaire (SPMSQ), a 10-item questionnaire with
questions designed to measure awareness, orientation,
short-term memory, and problem solving. Persons with 4 or
more incorrect answers are considered cognitively impaired
(Coughlin and Liu, 1989). Also, a person is assumed to be
cognitively impaired when a proxy reports that the sample
person is demented or otherwise mentally disabled. A per-
son who gives 2--3 incorrect answers is classified as border-
line impaired.
Cash income, financial assets, and eligibility for third-
party payments facilitate the use of paid help and also facil-
itate the purchase of assistive equipment. Liu, Manton, and
Liu (1985) have demonstrated a positive correlation be-
tween cash income and paid help in the community. Public
sector programs such as CHAMPVA and CHAMPUS
(which are associated with past military service) provide
payment for long-term care and so does Medicaid. How-
ever, the data for cash income and financial assets are noto-
riously imprecise because a large number of interviewed
persons either do not know or refuse to disclose this infor-
mation. The data on cash income were obtained from a
range-card. There was no range-card for financial assets;
therefore, the data on financial assets could not be used for
the purpose of this study.
Family, friends, and shared living quarters are other cop-
ing resources. Availability of family helpers and helping
friends depends on relationships nurtured earlier in life (be-
fore the onset of disability), as explained by Goldscheider
(1990) and shown by Whitbeck, Hoyt, and Huck (1994).
These relationships are evident in the combinations of
helpers shown in Table 1. The amount of help received
from relatives and nonrelatives is sensitive to marital status
and choice of living arrangements by unmarried persons.
Having a spouse increases the help received from the dif-
ferent combinations of helpers, suggesting that spouses
might be able to mobilize other helpers in addition to pro-
viding their own help. An unmarried person who coresides
with other adults is likely to receive more help than a per-
son who is living alone. Hence, marital status and the living
arrangements of unmarried persons are indicators of the re-
sources available to cope with disability in the community.
Table 1 presents the covariates of the regression analysis,
that is, the personal characteristics that determine the
amount of in-home help. These covariates are shown sepa-
rately for married and unmarried persons. For the latter, a
further distinction is made between living with others and
living alone. Unmarried individuals who are living with
others are more likely to need help than unmarried persons
living alone because the former are more likely to have
ADL disabilities or to be cognitively impaired. Family
members constitute the main resources for obtaining help.
The networks of family helpers are more extensive for mar-
ried than for unmarried persons because the former can
have help from a spouse alone or in combination with chil-
dren and others. The networks of family helpers are fragile
for persons living by themselves; one half of this group has
no family helpers and relies solely on nonrelatives as
helpers. Marital status is also associated with differences in
financial resources. Unmarried persons have less income
and are less likely to own a home. To compensate for the
disadvantage of not being married, some unmarried persons
coreside with other adults. Unmarried individuals in great
need of help are more likely to live with others than other-
wise similar persons with less need, who are likely to con-
tinue living alone.
Table 2 shows the distribution of help-hours for 3,088
persons who reported receiving help during the week pre-
ceding the interview. Half of all help-recipients had no more
than 25 hours of assistance, but a small fraction of disabled
persons absorbed a large amount of human assistance. The
selected percentiles demonstrate that this distribution is pos-
itively skewed with the greatest skewness observed for un-
married persons coresiding with other adults. As shown in
Table 1, this group had the highest proportion of persons
with three or more ADL disabilities. At each shown per-
centile, this group received more help than any of the other
groups. The least skewed is the distribution for persons liv-
ing alone, a group that had the smallest proportion of indi-
viduals with three or more ADL disabilities; at each shown
percentile, it received the smallest amount of help.
Results From the Regression Analysis
The dependent variable is measured by the number of
hours of help used by community-dwelling persons during
the week preceding their interview. Of the 4,463 sampled
individuals, 76.3 percent reported the number of hours
(7.1% reported zero hours or no help and 69.2% reported a
positive number of hours). Information on the numbers of
hours was not recorded (NR) for the remaining 23.7 percent
of the sample. The need for help serves as an exogenous
proxy for deciding whether NR hours are equivalent to zero
hours or to positive hours. The need indicators are: number
of ADL limitations, cognitive impairment, and very old
age. The proportions of persons having each of these char-
acteristics are examined for the three subsets: (i) positive
hours, (ii) zero hours, (iii) NR hours. The subsets are com-

"Persons with positive hours during the week preceding their interview.
pared pairwise in order to test for statistically significant
differences between recorded and nonrecorded hours, as
follows: (i) vs (ii), (i) vs (iii), (ii) vs (iii). Information avail-
able upon request shows that subset (i) differs from subset
(ii) and from subset (iii) in that it has much higher propor-
tions of persons who have three or more ADL disabilities,
who are cognitively impaired, and who are age 85 and
older; the differences are statistically significant at 5 per-
cent or 1 percent levels. In contrast, the differences between
subsets (ii) and (iii) are smaller and are not statistically sig-
nificant. The same pattern is found for the entire sample
and for each of its subgroups: married, unmarried, living
alone, or living with others; hence, NR hours are treated as
zero hours. The dependent variable is a continuous variable
that is censored at zero hours.
Conceptually, the number of help hours is a variable that
can have both positive and negative values because a person
can be either a recipient or a provider of help. The observed
hours in this sample are the ones received by elderly per-
sons, with no help as the limit. A regression model with
such a limited dependent variable is estimated as a Tobit.
Two Tobit equations distinguish between marital statuses
because married persons can have combinations of helpers
different from unmarried individuals. Two additional Tobit
equations distinguish between living arrangements of un-
married persons because unmarried persons in great need
for help are more likely to coreside with other adults than
to be living alone. Table 3 presents the Tobit results. Part A
presents the coefficients; Part B shows the marginal effects
of the explanatory variables on the amount of help that
would have been received by persons needing help (the
latent dependent variable), adjusted by the probability of
receiving help [as specified by McDonald and Moffitt
(1980, eq. 5)].
Living arrangements of unmarried persons with chronic
disabilities are specified as an endogenous determinant of
help-hours. Each equation of unmarried persons is adjusted
for this endogeneity. For all unmarried persons, predicted
living arrangements are specified as an explanatory instru-
mental variable (the identifying variables are home owner-
ship and the number of children). But the sensitivity of liv-
ing arrangements to the need for help suggests that these ar-
rangements ought to be interacted with indicators of need.
Further, different modes of living can be conducive to dif-
ferent combinations of helpers. The separate equations for
persons living alone and for persons coresiding with other
adults interact all other determinants of help with living ar-
rangements. Because they are based on an endogenous sort-
ing, they have to be adjusted for this sorting (selection). As
explained by Maddala (1983, Section 9.2), the adjustment
for endogeneity is derived from an auxiliary probit equa-
tion (available upon request). It estimates the probability of
coresidence as a function of the need for help, controlling
for other personal characteristics that might affect this
probability. The probability of sharing living quarters in-
creases with the difficulties in physical and cognitive func-
tioning and decreases with the use of assistive equipment. It
is positively associated with cash income, home ownership,
and the number of children; and sharing is more likely for
Blacks and other non-Whites than for Whites.
The discussion focuses on the marginal effects of vari-
ables with statistically significant coefficients. The control
variables are indicators of need for help. The number of
weekly help-hours increased consistently and substantially
with the number of ADL disabilities. The effects of other
indicators of need are much smaller and less consistent.
Cognitive impairment increased the amount of help for per-
sons sharing living quarters with other adults, and age 85+
increased the hours of help used by persons living alone.
Reliance on assistive equipment, when limitations in physi-
cal and cognitive functioning are held constant, comple-
mented human assistance (as suggested by Manton, Corder,
and Stallard, 1993a).
The major resources used to obtain help are the network
of helpers, living arrangements, cash income, and third-
party payments. The help received from the network is not
independent of marital status and living arrangements. The
amount of help depends very much on the kin relationship
between the helpers and the helped. The reference group
consists of persons whose helpers are only nonrelatives.
The cooperation of a spouse and children enabled an el-
derly person to have as much as 40 more hours of help per
week; and married persons who relied solely on their
spouses or only on their children had 31 and 34 additional
hours, respectively. The unmarried had a less extensive net-
work and, therefore, received less help; for them, the
amount of help depended very much on living arrange-
ments. For all unmarried persons, living alone reduced help
by 7 weekly hours compared to living with other adults.
The help which an unmarried parent received from his/her
children amounted to 25 additional hours per week if living
quarters were shared, and 8 additional hours if they were
not. But children together with others enabled unmarried
individuals to receive 29 additional hours if they were liv-
ing with other adults but only 10 hours if they were living
alone. The data clearly show the pivotal role of close rela-
tives in the network of helpers. Persons whose network did
not include close relatives did not have as much help as in-
dividuals who were helped by a spouse and children; and
similarly, living alone led to much less help than living
with a spouse or other adults. Cash income and third-party

payments from public-sector programs enabled the elderly
to obtain paid help but the effects of these variables on the
number of help-hours were relatively small.
Discussion
This study focuses on the resources with which commu-
nity-dwelling disabled elderly persons can meet their needs
for human assistance. Individuals differ in their needs as
well as in the level and mix of resources at their disposal,
and these differences lead to different amounts of help
used. Controlling for indicator of needs, this study esti-
mates the effects of available resources on the number of
hours of help used during a given week.
The distribution of help hours is very skewed. A rela-
tively small fraction of disabled persons absorbs a large
amount of human assistance. This skewness reflects the dis-
tribution of limitations in physical and cognitive function-
ing; only about one quarter of community-dwelling dis-
abled elderly persons has difficulty with performing three
or more routine activities of personal care and/or are cogni-
tively impaired. The distribution of help-hours varies by
living arrangements as does the distribution of ADL dis-
ability and cognitive impairment. Unmarried persons living
with other adults have the most help but also a much higher
likelihood of being cognitively impaired and/or disabled in
three or more ADLs.
The most reliable determinants of the amount of help re-
ceived by elderly persons are the number of ADL disabili-
ties, the network of helpers, and living arrangements. The
number of hours of help increases consistently with the
number of ADL disabilities for different marital statuses
and living arrangements, for men and women, and for
Whites and non-Whites. Controlling for the effect of needs,
married persons receive much more help than unmarried
ones and, among the latter, individuals coresiding with
other adults more than those living alone. Married persons
fare best when a spouse is joined by children as helpers; for
unmarried individuals, the combination of children and oth-
ers is the most conducive to receiving help. None of the
other variables that represent need (cognitive impairment
and very advanced age) or coping resources (assistive
equipment, cash income, and third party payments) have
any consistent effect, and the magnitudes of their effects
are quite small.
Other studies have determined that the networks of fam-
ily helpers are conducive to having help at home. This
study, however, differs in three aspects. First, the customary
indicators for this network have been marital status and
having children, whereas in this study, the network is speci-
fied by various combinations of helpers. Second, this study
measures the amount of help with greater precision than
studies that were based on earlier NLTCS, replacing fre-
quency of contact (i.e., the number of days during which
help was received) by the amount of help-time (number of
hours). Third, this study treats living arrangements as an
endogenous determinant of help-hours. In this respect, it
differs from the earlier studies that specified modes of liv-
ing as an exogenous variable. It also differs from a recent
study which specified living arrangements as an endoge-
nous choice because the findings from that study were ob-
tained from an experiment that was known to its partici-
pants as being time-limited, a knowledge that was likely to
affect their behavior. The present study, which is based on a
national probability sample, can be generalized to all com-
munity-dwelling elderly persons who need long-term care;
it determines the extent to which the number of help-hours
used at home can be attributed to coping resources, the
most important of which are different combinations of
helpers across marital status and living arrangements.
Variables that represent the need for help and the state-
S324 BOAZANDHU
of-the-art technology for assistive equipment are not
amenable to any changes (including policy incentives) in
the short run. In the long run, as a result of biomedical re-
search, appropriate prevention and medical treatments
might reduce the need for help, and innovations in assistive
technology might lessen dependence on human assistance.
The levels of income and assets, which signal ability to pay
for help, are mostly determined by earnings during work-
life. The network of helpers, which depends mostly on
having a spouse and adult children, is usually an outcome of
past events. The concern for public policy is whether family
help will continue to be the major source of assistance for
long-term disabled persons living in the community.
The networks of helpers are expected to change in the fu-
ture as an increasing number of elderly individuals will
have no spouse due to divorce, or because proportionally
more persons will have never been married. Childless el-
derly individuals lack an important source of support in old
age. Parents who, because of divorce, were absent during
child-rearing years may not be able to rely on help from
their children. Coresidence with adult children, the most
prevalent mode of shared living quarters by unmarried el-
derly persons in 1989, might decline; and residence in
board-and-care homes or in other assisted living facilities
can be expected to increase (Eckert and Lyon, 1992; Kane
and Wilson, 1993). The estimates of the amount of help re-
ceived from the informal networks suggest an order of the
magnitude of help that will have to be paid for when an in-
creasing number of elderly persons switch to living in facil-
ities that provide help for pay. The issue for public policy is
how to raise the funds that would support paid help in the
community for elderly individuals who do not have the
means to pay for help on their own and cannot rely on the
traditional networks of family helpers.
