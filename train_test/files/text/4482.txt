Introduction
In the recent past, the Indian government has been encouraging
to spread industrialization across the country, considering the
potential economic benefits they offer. In the present time of
privatization and liberalization, the public sector, in particular,
needs to take a look at its work environment. In this productiv-
ity- and performance-led global economy, participation in deci-
sion making is one of the important mechanisms and if
employees feel that they are not empowered, then the perfor-
mance and competitiveness of the organizations are at stake.
Also, in the rapidly changing business environment, the
employee­employer relationship undergoes a considerable
amount of stress that leads to low commitment and high attri-
tion. Employees form the most important resource of an orga-
nization. The employees in an organization have to be highly
talented to achieve sustainable competitive advantage (Barney,
1991). There is an increasingly diverse nature of workforce in
organizations. They engage in social interactions and economic
transactions within and outside their organizations. Capabilities
and efforts of employees are important sources of competitive
advantage.
It is well known that
organizations that are wholly or partially owned and controlled
by the state government are referred to as public sector
undertakings (PSUs) in India. In a PSU, majority (51% or more)
of the paid up share capital is held by central government or by
any state government or partly by the central governments and
partly by one or more state governments. (Public Sector
Undertakings in India, 2017)
The rationale of PSUs is rapid economic development,
reduction of concentration of economic powers, balanced
regional development, generating employment opportuni-
ties, import substitution, export promotion, and resource
mobilization. Government orders for PSUs generally aim at
betterment of the society (Peng, Bruton, Stan, & Huang,
2016). Arms and ammunition, defense equipments, defense
aircrafts, warships, atomic energy, railways transport, heavy
metals, aircraft, ships, petroleum, coal, natural gas, and
power generation come under PSUs in India.
According to Performance Report (2015), in India, "all
public sector undertakings collectively accounted for 23.2
percent of the total market capitalization" and "9 percent of
India's total export earnings was contributed by these

Influence of Trust and Participation in
Decision Making on Employee Attitudes
in Indian Public Sector Undertakings
S. Pavan Kumar1 and Shilpi Saha1
Abstract
Trust is an important component that needs to be present among individuals. Survey data from 712 managerial employees
from public sector undertakings were used to examine the effects of trust and participation in decision making on attitudinal
outcomes. Results indicate that trust is significantly related to job satisfaction, group commitment, and affective commitment.
Participation in decision making is a predictor of job satisfaction and affective commitment, but it did not predict group
commitment. Job satisfaction significantly influences group commitment and affective commitment. Group commitment
predicts affective commitment and acts as a mediator between job satisfaction and affective commitment. These findings
suggest that managers need to facilitate trust and active participation among employees by taking their opinions on different
work aspects. Organizations that allow employees' participation in decision making and are perceived as trustworthy have
employees who exhibit more attachment and identification with their organization.

organizations." A report by the Government of India has
stated that flexibility and autonomy in the PSUs have enabled
them to operate effectively in the competitive market with
outstanding results (Public Enterprises Survey, 2016). Many
of these organizations have significant worldwide presence
and are expanding (Peng et al., 2016). However, these PSUs
do not have their own theory contextualized unlike other
organizations (Srivastava, 2012).
In PSUs, employees from diverse cultural backgrounds
come together. This diversity does not affect them in work-
ing together. They often work collaboratively in taking
day-to-day decisions related to work (Ojasalo & Tähtinen,
2016). Participation in decision making allows individuals
to share influence among themselves who are not hierar-
chically equal (Wagner, 1994). Participative management
practices help to maintain a balance on the involvement of
managers as well as the subordinates in daily tasks and
activities related to the job. Increased levels of participa-
tion in work-related tasks can positively enhance the men-
tal health of employees (Kukenberger, Mathieu, & Ruddy,
2015). Employees have goals that require interaction with
other employees including cooperation and interdepen-
dence (Rogers & Ashforth, 2017). As a result, employees
feel motivated in their work and they feel highly satisfied
with their work. Substantial positive results are obtained in
their performance. In this context, trust and participation
of employees in decision-making processes are the two
important variables worth studying.
In the recent past, scholars have done research on trust as
an important managerial resource across organizations. Trust
is an integral part of daily social activities. It is essentially
considered as a facilitator that reduces transaction effort
(Bromiley & Cummings, 1995). Trust increases interdepen-
dence among individuals and reduces uncertainty among
them (Lleo, Viles, Jurburg, & Lomas, 2017). It is known to
work as a lubricant in functioning of organizations. It may
increase voluntary activities between individuals and organi-
zations. Employees who trust their peers and managers are
more likely to accept organizational goals and they are highly
satisfied and committed to their job. Participation influences
work practices, recognition, and rewards. It is believed that
participation correlates with job satisfaction and affective
commitment (Scott-Ladd, Travaglione, & Marshall, 2006).
The role of job satisfaction as a mediator between trust and
outcome variables needs to be studied.
In India, organizational factors such as management poli-
cies and work environment have been cited as the important
reasons behind affective commitment and alienation of
employees (Sinha, 1990). PSUs are complex because of mul-
tiple goals with conflicting interests of different stakeholders
(Narayan, 2016). An employee with a good amount of affec-
tive commitment will be ready to support the organization
whenever needed. It has been established from a review of
past studies that there are several beneficial outcomes of trust
such as job satisfaction, affective commitment, and group
commitment (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Shore, Tetrick,
Lynch, & Barksdale, 2006).
Morrow (1993) has defined affective commitment as an
attitude that reflects feelings such as attachment, identifica-
tion, or loyalty to the subject of commitment. It has strong
relationship with group-level outcomes and citizenship
behaviors because individuals impart greater effort when
they get motivated by high levels of attachment, identifica-
tion, and internalization (Giri & Kumar, 2013). Employees
exhibit distinguishable levels of affective commitment
toward their organization as well as their work group
(Johnson & Yang, 2010). Hence, the present study has
focused on individual's affective commitment toward his or
her work group. Affective group commitment has been
labeled as simply group commitment in this study following
the convention in past research (Cohen, 2003).
A work group consists of a group of employees working
collectively to complete organizational goals (Hackman,
1987). Work groups have been believed to facilitate many
positive organizational results such as employees' motiva-
tion, job satisfaction, and production (Mathieu, Maynard,
Rapp, & Gilson, 2008). A work environment without con-
flicts and with good amount of trust would help in learning
within work groups. In addition, if employees are highly
motivated and engaged in group-level activities, their job
satisfaction levels and satisfaction with coemployees
increase.
Group commitment is relatively less researched for its
antecedents and outcomes (Kukenberger et al., 2015). Group
commitment is attracting research for its importance in orga-
nizations. Impact of group commitment on affective commit-
ment has not been examined to the best of researchers'
knowledge. Relationship between job satisfaction and affec-
tive commitment has to be examined in the presence of group
commitment as a mediator. Also, mediating role of job satis-
faction needs to be studied. To address the paucity of research
in affective commitment toward organizations as well as
gaps in the group commitment literature, a model is described
and represented that has empirically tested the influence of
trust and participation in decision making on job satisfaction,
affective commitment, and group commitment.
Literature Review
Trust and Job Satisfaction
Excellent employment relationship is based on trust in orga-
nization (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005). Trust between
employees and managers delivers positive outcomes in an
organization. Many studies suggest that the increase of trust
toward superiors is because of favorable perceptions of the
employees (Lau & Sholihin, 2005). Presence of trust enables
long-termstabilityandwell-beingof employees(Appelbaum,
Louis, Makarenko, & Saluja, 2013; Cropanzano & Mitchell,
2005). Trust may facilitate well-being of employees as they
Kumar and Saha 3
have support of organizational members. However, it was
found that trust within management did not predict job satis-
faction in certain organizations (Robertson, Gockel &
Brauner, 2012). It is argued that greater trust in an organiza-
tion may lead to greater job satisfaction of employees in the
organization (Chen, Aryee, & Lee, 2005). The reasoning is
asserted on the basis that management and peers, rather than
any other general aspect, help to get the work done through
sharing knowledge and ideas.
Trust and Group Commitment
Trust between employer and employee is necessary to build
commitment (Rogers, 1995). Trust between work group
members helps members identify themselves with their work
group. It also helps to increase commitment of employees
toward a work group who are members of the group
(Moreland & Levine, 2002; Shore et al., 2006). It has been
suggested that trust among members of a work group helps
in the success of the work group (Cho & Poister, 2014).
Hence, it can be deduced that presence of trust among
employees may generate group commitment among mem-
bers of a work group.
Trust and Affective Commitment
Organizations need to build trust among its employees for
their own well-being at work (Peterson, 1998). Affective
commitment fosters when employees feel they are being
treated and valued for their contributions by the organization
(Nazir & Islam, 2017). Meyer and Allen (1997) opined that
affective commitment comprises of positive feelings of iden-
tification, attachment, and involvement with the organiza-
tion. A recent study had concluded that production and
administrative staff were attached to their organization as
they trusted their management (Lleo et al., 2017). It is antici-
pated that trust of employees in their managers may act as a
means to develop affective organizational commitment of
employees.
Participation in Decision Making and Job
Satisfaction
Participation in decision-making processes gives employees
a sense of belongingness toward the organization by consid-
ering their opinion in important matters. To reciprocate such
privileged actions, employees would exhibit identification
and loyalty with their organization. Research suggests that
employee participation across organizations is increasing
(Saha & Kumar, 2015). Participation improves flow of infor-
mation and, hence, transparent and open communications
occur (Anderson & McDaniel, 1999). Employees whose
opinions are considered for taking work-related decisions
have positive views about their job (Ornoy, 2010). Thus,
employees who view that their organizations are behaving in
their interest may experience greater job satisfaction (Parnell,
2003).
Participation in Decision Making and Group
Commitment
Participation in decision making and commitment may be
related to each other as evident in past research (Louis & Smith,
1992). High levels of organizational commitment are observed
in employees who participate in decisions (Giri & Kumar,
2013). Participation in decision making facilitates performance
of a work group (Chen, Kirkman, Kanfer, Allen, & Rosen,
2007). When employees have the ability to participate in deci-
sion making, they perceive it as an organizational support for
their work group to perform better (Kukenberger et al., 2015).
Participation may positively affect group commitment by
bringing the members of a work group close to each other.
Participation in Decision Making and Affective
Commitment
Employees who participate in decision making may be moti-
vated to deliver better performance because they feel very
happy when their opinions are considered while making
decisions (Saha & Kumar, 2015). Affective commitment
arises over time as an individual presents his views and opin-
ion over work matters (Ojasalo & Tähtinen, 2016). Every
employee who is attached to his or her organization would
want to have some form of influence in work-related deci-
sions (Giri & Kumar, 2013). This might strengthen affective
commitment of employees toward their organization.
Job Satisfaction and Group Commitment
Certain tasks in organizations involve working in teams. In
such cases, team spirit or group commitment should develop
among individuals. This gives rise to fair job satisfaction lev-
els of employees (Halepota & Shah, 2011). Randall and Cote
(1991) studied that group commitment evolves from social
ties of individuals and with job satisfaction in an organiza-
tion. When the reference team members provide guidance
and support to an individual, their social ties would improve.
Furthermore, it generally determines satisfaction with group
achievements (Baran & Giderler, 2017). Hence, group com-
mitment of the employee would also increase.
Job Satisfaction and Affective Commitment
Job satisfaction is of interest to employers and continues to
be studied because it is considered to be a desirable outcome
of employment. Job satisfaction is more likely to generate
good levels of group commitment. Highly satisfied employ-
ees would exhibit higher levels of performance and produc-
tivity as they believe in the values of the organization
(Srivastava, 2012). Research indicates that these employees
may become affectively attached to their organizations (Saha
4 SAGE Open
& Kumar, 2015). For example, an individual tends to show
emotional bonding toward his organization when he is satis-
fied with all aspects of his job such as colleagues and work
hours.
Group Commitment and Affective Commitment
Group commitment is defined as attachment of an individual
with other members in the organization (Randall & Cote,
1991). It is very less researched (Morrow, 1993). Most of the
research on group commitment was related to organizational
commitment conceptually or empirically. Work group com-
mitment is responsible for enhancing social involvement
(Randall & Cote, 1991). They explained that an individual
seeks guidance and reassurance from one's work group.
Social ties between the individual and the organization are
strengthened in this manner. Another reason for analyzing
group commitment as a separate variable together with affec-
tive commitment is the need to demonstrate the distinction
between the two commitments.
Group commitment is believed to have an impact on orga-
nizational commitment (Cohen, 2003). When employees
work in teams, they develop ties among themselves.
Employees of a work group share similar interests. This per-
ception of having similar interests may be associated with
group commitment (Ellemers, Kortekaas, & Ouwerkerk,
1999). To assess the performance and time a work group will
last, it is necessary to understand the impact of group com-
mitment on affective commitment (Ellemers et al., 1999).
Job Satisfaction as a Mediator
According to Baron and Kenny (1986), a variable can act as
a mediator when the following terms are met: (a) significant
levels of variation in the presumed mediator are caused by
varying levels of the independent variable, (b) significant
variations in the dependent variable caused by the presumed
mediator, and (c) a previous significant relation between a
dependent variable and independent variable becomes less
significant due to the presence of presumed mediator.
However, multiple commitments were not included in the
test for mediation.
Organizations emphasize on job satisfaction of employ-
ees. Job satisfaction may promote commitment of an
employee toward his work group (Halepota & Shah, 2011).
An employee needs to trust his colleagues to be able to work
comfortably (Appelbaum et al., 2013). To achieve job satis-
faction, members of a work group should trust each other
(Cho & Poister, 2014). This gives rise to the role of job satis-
faction as a mediator between trust and group commitment.
Group Commitment as a Mediator
Group commitment is a relatively new term (Cohen, 2003).
There is hardly any study that has examined the role of
group commitment as a mediator in organizational behav-
ior literature except one. Paille (2009) reported that group
commitment acts as a mediator between support variables
and commitment. It is beneficial to have employees who
are committed to work and organization. Satisfaction and
commitment with work is considered as a boon by organi-
zations. Job satisfaction may help employees to develop
positive feelings about the job to enhance his affective
commitment (Appelbaum et al., 2013). It may also pro-
mote group commitment of employees who are members
of a work group (Randall & Cote, 1991). This, in turn, may
help employees to build commitment toward the work
group (Cohen, 2003). This gives rise to mediating role of
group commitment between job satisfaction and affective
commitment.
Objectives
To investigate the effects of predictors, trust, and participa-
tion in decision making on outcomes, job satisfaction, group
commitment, and affective commitment, empirical analysis
is needed. In addition, mediating impact of job satisfaction
and group commitment between predictor and outcome is
examined. The objectives are listed below.
1. To find the impact of trust on job satisfaction, group
commitment, and affective commitment;
2. To find the impact of participation in decision mak-
ing on job satisfaction, group commitment, and affec-
tive commitment;
3. To find the impact of job satisfaction on group com-
mitment and affective commitment;
4. To examine the impact of group commitment on
affective commitment;
5. To investigate the mediating role of job satisfaction
between trust and group commitment; and
6. To investigate the mediating role of group commit-
ment between job satisfaction and affective
commitment.
Hypotheses Development
Empirical analysis has been done by developing the follow-
ing hypotheses (Figure 1).
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Trust will be positively related to job
satisfaction.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Trust will be positively related to
group commitment.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Trust will be positively related to
affective commitment.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Participation in decision making will
be positively related to job satisfaction.
Hypothesis 5 (H5): Participation in decision making will
be positively related to group commitment.

Hypothesis 6 (H6): Participation in decision making will
be positively related to affective commitment.
Hypothesis 7 (H7): Job satisfaction will be positively
related to group commitment.
Hypothesis 8 (H8): Job satisfaction will be positively
related to affective commitment.
Hypothesis 9 (H9): Group commitment will be positively
related to affective commitment.
Hypothesis 10 (H10): Job satisfaction will mediate the
relationship between trust and group commitment.
Hypothesis 11 (H11): Group commitment will mediate
the relationship between job satisfaction and affective
commitment.
Figure 1 demonstrates the hypothesized model based on
the literature review.
Measures
McAllister's (1995) scale was used to measure trust. It has
10 items (e.g., "I would have to say that we have made con-
siderable emotional investments in our working relation-
ship"). The items are measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale
ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
Participation in decision making was measured using a
scale developed by Van Veldhoven and Meijman (1994)
consisting of eight items (e.g., "Can you discuss work
problems with your superior?"). All items were measured
using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from always to
never.
To assess job satisfaction, Warr, Cook, and Wall's (1979)
scale was used, which has a total of 15 items (e.g., satisfac-
tion with freedom to choose your own method of working).
All items were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale rang-
ing from I am extremely satisfied to I am extremely
dissatisfied.
Affective commitment was measured using Meyer and
Allen's (1991) scale. It consisted of eight items (e.g., "I
would be very happy to spend the rest of my career with this
organization"). All items were measured on a 5-point Likert-
type scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
Group commitment was assessed using Ellemers, de
Gilder, and Van den Heuvel's (1998) scale. It consisted of
seven items (e.g., "I am prepared to do additional work when
this benefits my work team"). All items were measured on a
5-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly agree to
strongly disagree. The items to measure the different vari-
ables have been included in the appendix.
Statistical Tools and Techniques Used for Data
Analysis
The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and
WarpPLS were used to analyze the data. The statistical anal-
yses such as obtaining descriptive statistics, developing the
correlation matrix, and calculating Cronbach's alpha values
of the various measures used in the study have been analyzed
using SPSS. WarpPLS tool was used to perform some
advance statistical techniques such as creating structural
equation models. The hypothesized structural model emerg-
ing from the review of literature was subjected to analysis
and fit tests. For this purpose, a variety of goodness-of-fit
indices as provided by WarpPLS (Pearl, 2009; Wagner, 1982)
were utilized. The hypothesized model was tested and the
conclusions regarding the model fit and acceptance are
reported.
Method
Managerial cadre respondents from four different large-scale
organizations termed as PSUs in India constituted the sam-
ple. These organizations belonged to bauxite, petroleum, and
heavy industries and the states covered were Orissa, Madhya
Pradesh, Delhi, West Bengal, Assam, Maharashtra, and
Karnataka. Data were collected by visiting the organizations
in person. Convenience sampling technique was adopted to
identify organizations. This procedure entails participation
from all regions based on convenience, willingness, interest,

and availability of respondents to obtain quality responses
(Verma & Duggal, 2015). However, care was taken to include
participation from all regions of India. The sample consists
of employees from different departments, namely, human
resource (HR), finance, electrical, instrumentation, mining,
civil, environment, tender and contract, sales, production,
chemical, lab, research and development, and several other
departments. Participation of employees in this study was
voluntary. Respondents were asked not to disclose their iden-
tities so that the identities are anonymous. They were
requested to respond to all the questions. It took a maximum
of 45 min to completely respond to the questionnaire. The
filled questionnaires were collected over a period of 5 days
from each of the organizations.
Of the 1,200 survey questionnaires distributed, 780 (i.e.,
65%) questionnaires were received back. Few incomplete
questionnaires were rejected and 712 (i.e., 59.33%) ques-
tionnaires were retained for the study. Of these subjects,
95.6% were males and the rest were females; 85% were
reported to be married and the rest were single; 13.3%,
27.9%, 39.3%, and 19.4% were in the age group of 51 to 60
years, 41 to 50 years, 31 to 40 years, and 21 to 30 years,
respectively. There were 44% participants each in entry-
level management and middle-level management; 12.1%
were in senior-level management. The average years of
work experience across all levels of management was 14.14
years. In the overall sample, 61.3% subjects had BE/BTech
as highest qualification, 36.2% had ME/MTech/MBA as
highest qualification, and 2.5% had PhD as highest qualifi-
cation. Among all subjects, the maximum tenure was found
to be 33 years.
Empirical Results
To study the behavior of the variables in the hypothesized
model, statistical analysis was performed using variance-
based structural equation modeling (SEM) by using the par-
tial least squares (PLS) approach.
The data were subjected to statistical analysis to test the
above hypotheses. First, mean, standard deviation, reliabil-
ity, and intercorrelation were computed. Table 1 shows the
mean, standard deviation, and reliability coefficients for all
the measures.
As the values for Cronbach's alpha are well above the rec-
ommended threshold of .70, the reliability of the measure-
ments is considered valid (Fornell & Larcker, 1981).
Outer Model/Measurement Model Validation
The relationship of observed variables with their respective
latent constructs comprises the outer model. Indicator reli-
ability, construct reliability, and construct validity (conver-
gent and discriminant validity) are examined. Indicator
reliability is established when the indicator (factor) loading
is greater than .50 (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson &Tatham,
2006). Construct validity is established by composite reli-
ability (CR) values of the construct. CR is considered to be a
superior alternative to Cronbach's alpha (Chin, 1998). CR
measures the sum of a latent variable's factor loadings rela-
tive to the sum of the factor loadings plus error variance.
This value ranges from 0 to 1. This value should be greater
than .60 for the validity of a construct. CR values above the
threshold of .70 indicate strong convergent validity (Kline,
2015; Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994).
The CRs of all variables range from .80 to .91 as pre-
sented in Table 2. Moreover, both CR indicators and
Cronbach's alpha values of all the variables are above the
threshold value of .70. All outer loadings were significant
and were greater than their cross loadings. Hence, measure-
ments have strong convergent validity (Hair,et al., 2006).
Moreover, it is evident from Table 2 that all variance infla-
tion factor (VIF) values are less than 5. VIFs of 3.3 or lower
avoid issues of multicollinearity and high interassociations
among latent variables (Kock & Lynn, 2012).
Table 3 presents the correlations among the latent vari-
ables with square roots of average variance extracted (AVE)
at diagonals. Correlation analysis was employed to examine
the relationship among participation in decision making,
trust, job satisfaction, group commitment, and affective
organizational commitment. For assessing discriminant
validity, square root of AVE of a variable should be greater
than its bivariate correlation with any other variable (Hulland,
1999). The values .94, .95, .94, .96, and .96 are greater than
the correlations in the row for the variables TRUST, PDM,
JS, GC, and AOC, respectively. Thus, discriminant validity
of the variables is established.
Inner Model/Structural Model Validation
Proposed hypothetical model was prepared in a recursive
manner to avoid problems associated with statistical identifi-
cation (Hair et al., 2006).
Figure 2 shows the results of an SEM analysis aimed at
testing the hypothesized effects among the latent variables.

and they refer to the standardized regression path coeffi-
cients associated with statistically significant effects.
The strength of each path of the structural equation model
and the variance (R2 coefficients) of the endogenous vari-
ables should be greater than .1 (Falk & Miller, 1992). Figure
2 shows that the R2 coefficients of endogenous latent vari-
ables are greater than .15 (good amount of variance is
explained by the hypothesized variables). TRUST and PDM
are exogenous variables, so there exists no R2 value. As evi-
dent in Figure 2 and Table 4, all the significant path coeffi-
cients are above .2 and are significant at p < .001 level except
for one path, which is insignificant.
Tables 5 and 6 show the results for mediating role of job
satisfaction and group commitment based on the suggestions
of Baron and Kenny (1986) and Sobel (1982). The total
mediation effects for all the paths were significant at p <
.001. The mediating impact of JS between trust and GC is not
supported by results (Sobel z value = 6.83, p > .01). This
rejected H10. The results confirm the mediating effect of GC
between JS and GC (Sobel z value = 4.78, p < .001). Thus,
H11 is accepted.
Model Fit of the Structural Model
Table 7 reports the values of all indices--average path coef-
ficient (APC), average adjusted R-squared (AARS),
R-squared contribution ratio (RSCR), and nonlinear bivari-
ate causality direction ratio (NLBCDR)--obtained are within
the fit criteria mentioned in the third column. Hence, the
model fit is achieved for the present study.
Discussion
The results of the present study indicate that trust has a sig-
nificant relationship with job satisfaction, which is supported
by past research (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005). This is due
to the reason that presence of trust among employees helps
them to have a mutually sharing relationship in which ideas
and feelings are freely shared. If an employee has a

trustworthy relationship, then he feels safe and positive. This
leads to higher job satisfaction. However, if there is no trust,
an employee does not feel safe and he is likely to worry. This
will have negative effect and there can be no job satisfaction
(Chen et al., 2005).
This study offers a unique understanding of group com-
mitment with other outcomes. Trust is an important driver of
group commitment as evident in findings. This outcome
grows with the seed of trust (Moreland & Levine, 2002). It
strengthens the social interactions among employees.
Uncertainty among them is reduced. Difficulties and issues
related to work are solved easily when there is cooperation
among the employees. Hence, success at work is easily
achieved by the employees. Organizations may choose to
consider group performance important for their growth.
Hence, employees give more importance to generate effec-
tive group results. Hence, trust is considered by employees
as essential to build emotional relationships among them-
selves. Managers might trust only those members of a work
group who consider the work important to be completed on
time.
A significant relationship between trust and affective
commitment is also found. Trust helps to share information
freely. Thus, healthy relationship prevails among all employ-
ees (Lleo et al., 2017). They feel happy that their work and
experience is valued by their colleagues and managers.
Interactions increase among employees. This creates a trust-
worthy work environment. The employees develop positive
feelings for their organization by exhibiting affective com-
mitment (Nazir & Islam, 2017).
The results suggest that Indian PSUs are interested in
enhancing employee job satisfaction through employees'
participation in decision making, which has been supported
in previous research (Ornoy, 2010). Affective commitment is
determined by the extent of participation of employees in
day-to-day work-related decisions allowed to them by their
supervisors. The more the participation, the better will be the
relationship between participation in decision making and
affective commitment. Employees are able to identify more
with the organization when they have an active role in mak-
ing policies and decisions of their organization (Ojasalo &
Tähtinen, 2016). This is because participation gives certain
amount of satisfaction to the employees. This satisfaction
obtained by participation cannot be replaced by any other
form of involvement. Participation in the decision-making
process also helps employees to understand the functioning
of their organization thoroughly in terms of managerial and
technical functions. Employees would also be able to under-
stand the managerial and technical issues in a better
manner.
As per the results, participation in decision making did
not have significant impact on group commitment of employ-
ees, in contrast to the findings of Kukenberger et al. (2015).
This is because participation in decision making can cause
many disadvantages in a work group. There can be pressures
arising from social systems to dominance by some members
of the group due to unequal distribution of power. An

influential member may cause other members to follow the
decisions taken by him, which may be disliked by other
members as stated in leader­member exchange theory.
Hence, indecisiveness, lack of consensus, and group con-
flicts might arise. In such situations, the employee might feel
neglected by his work group. Hence, he may not be able to
identify with his work group to the required extent. The com-
mitment toward his group decreases gradually.
Another finding of note is that job satisfaction exerted
a strong influence on group commitment. This finding is
supported by past research on group commitment
(Knippenberg & Schie, 2000). Thus, the positive associa-
tion between job satisfaction and group commitment
implies that identification and attachment with the group
can be improved by providing supportive work groups and
providing recognition within the reference groups for
good work. Social ties are believed to achieve strong sat-
isfaction level while working in groups. Thus, when the
members of the work group of an individual provide sup-
port and guidance in work, the satisfaction obtained by
good work will help in observing a significant amount of
group commitment.
The results report that job satisfaction has a significant
impact on the magnitude of affective commitment. This
result is at par with past research (Appelbaum et al., 2013).
Employees seek a certain level of satisfaction in the job they
perform. This is possible when they have a certain level of
trust in management. Hence, appreciation from managers
gives satisfaction to the employees. Employees will have a
positive emotional feeling about their job. Their expectations
are met from the job as well as the organization (Rogers &
Ashforth, 2017). This would motivate the employees more
toward their organization. The positive emotional feeling
would give rise to commitment or attachment with the orga-
nization. It creates positive work environment in the organi-
zation. Such positive work environment enhances the
relationship between job satisfaction and organizational
commitment.
As far as group commitment in the PSUs is concerned, the
study shows that it is a significant predictor of affective com-
mitment (Appelbaum et al., 2013). It is also found to mediate
the impact of job satisfaction on affective commitment
shown in the empirical testing supported by a past study
(Paille, 2009). Group commitment is the cohesiveness of an
individual with the members of his or her group. It implies
that an employee who is attached to his work group would be
equally attached to his or her organization. Job satisfaction
can have an indirect influence on affective commitment
when group commitment facilitates this relationship
(Srivastava, 2012). Thus, a part of this study highlights that
group commitment is an equally independent variable as
affective commitment. Thus, it is worthy to study how sig-
nificant amount of group commitment can be achieved with
affective organizational commitment.

Implications
The concepts of trust, participation in decision making, job
satisfaction, and affective commitment are given impor-
tance by many researchers. They are of the opinion that
organizational leaders have to emphasize on these concepts
to receive consistent attention (Meyer & Allen, 1997). The
attitudinal outcomes such as group commitment, affective
commitment, and job satisfaction help establish the rela-
tionship of an employee with his or her organization. In this
way, the organization will consider its best interests not
only while making business decisions but also for the wel-
fare of the employee.
The results of this study confirm a set of hypotheses
about the nature of relationship between trust and attitudi-
nal outcomes. Trust can have a strategic role for coping
with uncertainties (Bromiley & Cummings, 1995). Greater
trust among each other implies greater satisfaction with the
job. Trust among members eases group work. In this way, it
enhances commitment with the work group as well as the
whole of organization. These outcomes are essential for an
employee to continue working with the organization. Trust
has an indirect influence on group commitment through job
satisfaction. In this light, it can be inferred that trust should
be viewed and prioritized as an important concept in
organizations.
This study has been able to identify the role of employ-
ees' participation in decision making on attitudinal out-
comes. Participation in decision making was not
exclusively related to job satisfaction, but it also signifi-
cantly predicted affective organizational commitment.
This is supported by findings from previous researchers
that increasing participation has strong sense of identity
and satisfaction with the job (Kim, 2002). Job satisfaction
also significantly predicted organizational commitment.
The findings of this study are relevant to the managers and
directors of the PSUs in understanding how affective
organizational commitment develops. Several organiza-
tional factors arose to explain the relationship between
trust, participation in decision making, and behavioral
outcomes of employees in organizations. As globalization
and economy are growing, there exists tough competition
for the PSUs. The present study has implemented the rec-
ommendations of Black and Gregersen (1997) that sug-
gest that organizations can enhance employees' job
satisfaction by improving participation. Participation
allows the management of the organization to tap the
skills and ideas of the employees for better efficiency in
production.
Three important strategies can be derived by the orga-
nizations from the results of this study to enhance their
employees' job satisfaction. First, employees will extend
their support and efforts more when PSUs develop strate-
gies to support employees' career interests. Second, these
organizations can communicate more with employees
about their responsibilities, participation, and perfor-
mance on the job, thus enhancing their job satisfaction
and commitment. In this manner, they will understand
how their present performance and strategies can contrib-
ute to the work. Third, the organizations should make sure
that while working in a group, the junior employees do not
feel less important. It is often observed that the senior
employees do not treat their junior colleagues equally in
terms of recognizing their potential. The managers should
ensure that the junior employees are recognized equally
well as their senior employees for appreciable collective
or group work.
This study has taken research on group commitment, a
very recent variable, to new levels. Predictors of affective
organizational commitment illustrate that emotional attach-
ment of employees with their organization depends on trust,
participation, and how good are their job satisfaction and
cordial relations in a work group. These predictors are
affected by the degree of group commitment. Organizations
should ensure that employees' skills are enhanced and they
know how to implement latest technological advances. This
will help the PSUs to have sound technical and support
domains. They will also stay at the cutting edge, and remain
competitive in this manner.
Limitations and Scope of Future Research
Few limitations have to be addressed. Only cross-sectional
data have been considered in this study. Future studies can
consider implementing the model with longitudinal data.
However, it is a challenging task to conduct a longitudinal
study as the same respondents may not be available across
different points of time (Stratford, Mulligan, Downie, &
Voss, 1999).
This study is specifically conducted for Indian PSUs.
Thus, the results of the study should be used carefully
while applying to other companies such as multinational
companies (MNCs). Then, a comparison between the
results of the model from two different sectors can be
done. It can be worthwhile in conducting a multilevel
study by generating a conceptual model involving psycho-
logical variables such as trust and participative manage-
ment interventions, and attitudinal variables such as
commitment and job satisfaction. This would allow
researchers to understand the impact of participation
interventions and trust on various organizational and
behavioral outcomes. Future research can also be carried
with samples from different locations across different
industries. In addition, other sectors such as health care,
insurance, and services can implement the model so that
the findings can have larger implications.
