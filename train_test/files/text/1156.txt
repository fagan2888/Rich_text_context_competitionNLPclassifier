of Dimensions of Health in the Subjective
Construction of Age

Objectives. This study examines health inequality as a potential explanation for socioeconomic differences in age
identity. The following dimensions of health are examined: comparative self-rated health, self-assessed changes in
physiological well-being, prospective self-rated health, perceived control over health, chronic conditions, and
parents' health. Components of health also are explored as possible mediators of age differences in the effect of
socioeconomic status on age identity.
Methods. Using the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, ordinary least squares regression
models of age identity are estimated for a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population between the
ages of 25 and 74 (n 5 2,864).
Results. The older identities held by the less socioeconomically advantaged are explained by their worse health,
particularly their less favorable predictions of future health, compared with their wealthier peers. Differences in age
identity by education and perceived financial well-being are greatest among older adults; however, health only partially
accounts for these age patterns.
Discussion. This study reveals that health inequalities shape the subjective experience of aging. Further work using
longitudinal data is needed to determine the precise causal pathways linking socioeconomic status, health, and age
identity.
SOCIOECONOMIC status (SES) is a major factor shaping
the multiple strands of the life course, including family,
work, and health trajectories. An earlier onset of health
limitations and faster rate of decline in functional ability are
found among those of lower SES (House et al., 1994). In
addition to facing earlier health decrements, they tend to
experience many of the transitions marking one's passage
through the adult life course, such as the completion of
education, marriage, parenthood, and retirement, at younger
ages than their more advantaged peers (Axinn & Thornton,
1992; Neugarten & Moore, 1968; O'Rand & Henretta, 1999).
Because it influences the timing of life transitions and rate of
physiological decline, SES is a primary determinant of the
subjective experience of aging; it shapes the way an individual
thinks about age and the stages of life in general and his or
her own age and life stage in particular. Compared with
their wealthier counterparts, individuals of lower SES tend to
perceive a more temporally compressed life course. They view
the onset of old age as occurring at a younger age, perceive
earlier cultural age deadlines for many adult transitions, and
anticipate a shorter life span (Mirowsky & Ross, 2000; Rosow,
1967; Settersten & Hagestad, 1996). Consistent with these
patterns, the less advantaged tend to adopt older age identities
than the more privileged (George, Mutran, & Pennybaker,
1980; Markides & Boldt, 1983).
One may argue that these findings on the perceptions of
one's life course and age are not surprising or of much concern,
because lower SES is, in fact, associated with earlier life course
transitions and shorter life expectancy. However, they can be
viewed not only as mirrors of the objective reality of divergent
life course patterns that are produced in a highly economically
stratified society, but also as indications of some of the
deleterious, psychological consequences of occupying a disad-
vantaged position in such a society. Maintaining a youthful
identity as one ages has been viewed as a self-enhancing
strategy in a culture, like the dominant culture in the United
States, that highly values youth (Barak & Stern, 1986;
Montepare & Lachman, 1989). Indeed, research indicates that
beginning in middle-age, Americans adopt increasingly youth-
ful identities (Goldsmith & Heiens, 1992; Montepare &
Lachman, 1989). Moreover, there is evidence that it is an
effective means of self-enhancement: Adults with youthful
identities in middle and later life have better mental health, life
satisfaction, morale, and self-esteem (Barak & Stern, 1986).
Members of lower socioeconomic strata use this strategy to
a lesser degree; as a result, they are disadvantaged not only by
objective conditions of their lives (such as their health), but also
by conceptions of their age.
Because the older identities of the less advantaged are
indications of some of the harmful, but less visible, effects of
occupying lower socioeconomic strata, this topic deserves more
attention than it has received in the last decade or so. The link
between SES and age identity has been well-documented;
however, much less is known about the underlying social
psychological mechanisms. Drawing on the strong relationships
between social class and health (Adler et al., 1994; Williams &
Collins, 1995) and between health and age identity (Logan,
Ward, & Spitze, 1992; Markides & Boldt, 1983), this study

focuses on dimensions of health as potential explanations for
socioeconomic differences in age identity. Of particular interest
is not only objective and subjective health, but also multiple
points of reference for one's perceived health. Drawing on prior
research reporting that socioeconomic differences in health
expand with age (House et al., 1994; Ross & Wu, 1996), this
study also examines potential age differences in the effect of
SES on perceptions of one's age.
SES and Age Identity
Research has found consistently that occupying lower
socioeconomic strata is associated with having older identities.
Compared with the more advantaged, individuals of lower SES
are more likely to classify themselves as ``old'' or ``elderly''
(George et al., 1980; Mutran & George, 1982) and feel older
than their chronological age (Baum & Boxley, 1983; Steitz &
McClary, 1988). This pattern is found across indicators of SES,
including education (Markides & Boldt, 1983; Steitz &
McClary, 1988) and income (Baum & Boxley, 1983; Mutran
& George, 1982). Subjective assessments of financial well-
being have been rarely examined, and results have been
inconsistent (Bultena & Powers, 1978; Steitz & McClary,
1988).
Most of the explanations for the older identities of the more
disadvantaged center on class differences in the timing of social
and biological aging. For example, Neugarten and Moore
(1968) argue that the earlier timing of life events--such as
marriage, childbearing, and retirement--may account for the
more rapid pace of the subjective life course of those of lower
SES. Although the temporal pattern of life transitions has not
been examined empirically as an explanation for socioeco-
nomic differences in age identity, some research exploring role
losses in later life supports this hypothesis. Some have found,
for example, that widowhood (George et al., 1980; Mutran &
Reitzes, 1981) and retirement (Bultena & Powers, 1978;
Mutran & George, 1982) are associated with older identities;
however, the findings have not been consistent (cf. Logan et al.,
1992; Ward, La Gory, & Sherman, 1988).
Another explanation for social class differences in age
identity also rests on role transitions; however, it focuses on
perceived losses associated with the transitions, rather than their
timing in the life course. Rosow (1967) posits that individuals
of higher SES have ``more to lose'' by relinquishing younger
identities and their accompanying social resources. In other
words, role losses typically associated with later life, such as
retirement, are more threatening to the status of middle class
individuals; therefore, they have a greater incentive to deny
their age.
Health trajectories explanation.--In addition to the temporal
pattern and perception of family and work transitions, a third
hypothesis has been offered regarding socioeconomic differ-
ences in age identity. Rosow (1967) has argued that occupying
lower socioeconomic strata produces a more rapid rate of
physiological aging as a consequence of cumulative hardships
over the life course; hence, older identities are found among the
most disadvantaged. The mediating role of health has received
limited attention in research; however, it is plausible given the
associations among social class, health, and age identity.
Research has found consistently that lower SES is related to
worse physical health (Adler et al., 1994; Williams & Collins,
1995) and self-ratings of health (Borg & Kristensen, 2000;
Manor, Matthews, & Power, 1997). Work on age identity has
revealed that worse health is associated with feeling older than
one's actual age (Baum & Boxley, 1983; Linn & Hunter, 1979)
and describing oneself as ``old'' (Logan et al., 1992; Markides
& Boldt, 1983). This pattern has been found across a range of
health indicators, including objective measures such as number
and severity of chronic conditions and use of health services
(Markides & Boldt, 1983; Mutran & George, 1982), and
subjective ratings of health (Baum & Boxley, 1983; Logan
et al., 1992). Corroborating the evidence from quantitative
research, the qualitative work of Sherman (1994) reports that
changes in health are the most frequently cited reasons for
beginning to feel older.
Health has been treated largely as a control variable in
studies of age identity. The only work I have found that
includes analyses useful in examining the potential mediating
role of health is by Mutran and Burke (1979). Although not
a focus of their study, they find that education exerts an effect
on age identity through self-rated health. However, they use an
indicator of age identity that differs from those most often used
in subjective age research. In contrast with items that ask
respondents direct questions about their self-perceived ages, the
authors examine measures indicating the degree to which
respondents identify with characteristics stereotypically associ-
ated with older ages. It is not known whether similar results
would be found using indicators that more directly reflect
perceptions of one's age.
Limited attention has been given to the potential mediating
effects of health; further, the relative importance of various
dimensions of health in an individual's construction of sub-
jective age is not known. Objective and subjective di-
mensions of health have been found to be predictors of age
identity; Ward and colleagues (1988) examine both and report
that they exert similarly strong effects. Other dimensions of
health that may shape age identity have not been examined, in
particular those reflecting the multiple frames of reference that
individuals may use in evaluating their health.
Theories of social evaluation and reference groups would
suggest that individuals construct their own age identities
through a process of comparing the conditions of their lives,
including their health, against same-age peers as well as more
generalized images of persons in their stage of life (Festinger,
1954; Singer, 1981). Comparative self-rated health has been
examined in some research on age identity: More favorable
evaluations of one's health relative to peers are associated with
younger identities (Bultena & Powers, 1978; Logan et al.,
1992). Further, the work of Sherman (1994) reports that re-
spondents frequently made comparisons with same-age peers or
family members in constructing their own age identities,
a recurring theme in her interviews that she refers to as the
``comparative self.''
Findings reported by Sherman (1994) point to other frames
of reference that are relevant to examining the role of health in
the construction of subjective age. The ``retrospective self,'' or
the way one remembers oneself in younger years, suggests that
perceptions of past health, perhaps as a point of comparison for
current health, may shape age identity. Perceptions of age may
BARRETT
S102
be influenced not only by one's remembered past health, but
also images of what one's health will be in the future.
Considering both the comparative and temporal elements of age
identity, one's images of future health may be shaped by
perceptions of the health trajectories of one's parents or other
relatives. As Neugarten (1968) notes, people may begin in
middle-age to identify with the older generation and wonder if
they will age in similar ways.
In addition to dimensions of comparative health, other
perceptions that may influence age identity have not been
explored, including perceived control over health that is
positively related to SES (Mirowsky, Ross, & Van Willigen,
1996). Adopting a more youthful, and more age-discrepant,
identity can be seen as an active reinterpretation of one's
chronological age; maintaining a youthful identity is likely to
require a high degree of perceived control over one's health. As
Linn and Hunter (1979, p. 50) note: ``If one is in poor health,
uneducated, and poor, then feeling younger than one's age
probably takes a strong inner belief in one's ability to control
life events.''
Age differences in the relationship between SES and age
identity.--Not only has limited attention been given to the
process through which age identity is constructed, but also little
is known about potential age differences in the effect of SES on
age identity. It is well-documented that older persons adopt
more age-discrepant, youthful identities than those in midlife
(Barak & Stern, 1986; Goldsmith & Heiens, 1992; Montepare
& Lachman, 1989), but is this pattern found across all
socioeconomic strata? The only work I have found that ex-
plores the potential interactive effect of age and social class on
age identity examines only two groups, those younger than 75
and those 75 or older; this study finds that the effect of SES is
stronger in the younger group (Rosow, 1967). More fine-
grained analyses, however, would help to identify points in the
life course at which members of lower socioeconomic strata are
especially disadvantaged by their views of their aging selves in
a culture valuing youth.
As individuals age, advantages held by members of higher
socioeconomic strata, such as having more financial resour-
ces and better health, become magnified (House et al., 1994;
O'Rand, 1996; Ross & Wu, 1996). Often referred to as the
cumulative advantage and disadvantage hypothesis, this di-
vergence in resources over the life course raises the pos-
sibility that a similar process occurs in perceptions of age:
Socioeconomic differences in age identity that produce older
identities among the less advantaged may be greatest in later
stages of life. Considering this hypothesis in conjunction
with the strong link between health and age identity further
suggests that health may play a critical role in explaining
age differences in the effect of SES on age identity. In other
words, the cumulative effects of poor health and more
limited access to health care among disadvantaged members
of society may produce wider socioeconomic differences in
age identity in later life.
Drawing from prior research and the theoretical frameworks
underlying this study, the following hypotheses are made: (1)
lower SES will be significantly associated with adopting an
older identity; (2) dimensions of health, both objective and
subjective, will partially mediate the effect of SES on age
identity; (3) the effect of SES on age identity will be strongest
among older adults; and (4) dimensions of health, both
objective and subjective, will partially account for the stronger
effect of SES on age identity among older adults.
METHODS
Sample
Data are drawn from the National Survey of Midlife
Development in the United States (MIDUS; Brim et al.,
2000) collected in 1995 and 1996 by the John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation Network on Successful Midlife
Development. The MIDUS sample (n 5 3,032) is representa-
tive of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population between the
ages of 25 and 74 who have telephones. The sample was
generated through random-digit dialing; older respondents and
men were oversampled. MIDUS involved a telephone interview
and two self-administered mail-back questionnaires. The over-
all response rate was 60.8%. Because MIDUS includes
measures of age identity and self-assessed health, the data are
appropriate for this study. However, a limitation is introduced
by the use of cross-sectional data. The broad questions
stimulating this research involve temporal processes. Social
class is hypothesized to affect health which, in turn, influences
age identity. It is also expected that the effect of SES on age
identity becomes stronger as individuals age. Although findings
may be consistent with these age effects and causal pathways,
alternative interpretations cannot be eliminated.
Of the 3,032 respondents completing the telephone and mail-
back surveys, 111 were not included because they were missing
on items used in the construction of the dependent variable (i.e.,
chronological age or subjective age). To avoid the influence of
extreme scores in the analyses, respondents with age identities
falling in the top or bottom 1% of the scores were excluded
from the analyses yielding a study sample of 2,864. In analyses
presented, data are weighted to adjust for selection probabilities
and nonresponse.
As described in Table 1, age identity is indicated by the
difference between one's subjective and chronological age; on
average, respondents feel between 6 and 7 years younger than
their actual age. Six measures of health are used: comparative
self-rated health, self-assessed changes in physiological well-
being, prospective self-rated health, perceived control over
health, parents' health, and number of chronic conditions. The
indicators of SES are education, household income, and
perceived financial well-being. The following sociodemo-
graphic variables associated with age identity are included as
controls: age, gender, and race (Barak & Stern, 1986). For each
of the following variables, less than 5% of the sample contained
missing values, and means are used to impute values: race,
income, education, perceived financial well-being, comparative
health, self-assessed physiological changes, prospective self-
rated health, perceived control over health, and chronic
conditions. Approximately 12% of the sample have missing
data on the status of one or both parents (typically the father);
however, a third of these respondents report having a parent in
good health. These respondents are assigned to the ``no
parent(s) in poor health'' category. Of the remaining respond-
ents missing on these variables, those age 65 or older are
assigned to the ``both parents deceased'' category; those
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND AGE IDENTITY S103
younger than 65 are assigned to the ``no parent(s) in poor
health'' group.
Analyses
Ordinary least squares regression is used to examine the
effect of SES on age identity. To explore the mediating effect of
health, several models are run. First, age identity is regressed on
education, income, perceived financial well-being, age, gender,
and race. Each health indicator is then entered in a separate
step. A final model includes all health measures. To examine
potential age differences in the effect of SES on age identity,
interactive models are run. Three interaction terms are added,
one at a time, to the model containing age, gender, race, and the
indicators of SES: age*education, age*income, and age*per-
ceived financial well-being. To reduce multicollinearity,
variables are centered at the mean before constructing the
interaction terms. In the last stage of analyses, the potential
mediating effect of health on the interaction between age and
SES is examined by entering each of the health measures in
a separate step. In tables reporting the results of regression
analyses, mediating effects are indicated by the difference
between coefficients from the baseline model (Model 1 in each
table) and coefficients generated in each subsequent model.
RESULTS
Table 2 reports the results of the regression of age identity on
SES and the health measures. Model 1 reveals that older
chronological age is associated with reporting a younger
identity; however, the effect of age is weaker at older ages.
Being non-White and having more education and better
financial well-being are predictive of more youthful identities.
In Models 2­7, all the health measures reach significance;
however, the magnitude of the role they play in the process
linking SES and age identity varies. Model 2 indicates that
more favorable assessments of one's health compared with
peers are related to more youthful identities. For example,
having ``much better'' health than one's peers is associated with
an age identity that is approximately 2 years younger than that
reported by individuals with only ``somewhat better'' health.
Moreover, the coefficient for education falls by 50% and is no

longer significant; the coefficient for financial well-being
declines by 43%. The results indicate that the more advantaged
have younger identities, in part, because they make more
favorable comparisons of their health with that of their peers.
Model 3 reveals that more positive assessments of one's
recent physiological changes are associated with younger
identities, and they partially mediate the effect of financial
well-being on age identity (i.e., the coefficient declines by
25%). However, this variable slightly suppresses the effect of
education on age identity. Contrary to expectations, higher
levels of education are associated with less favorable assess-
ments of recent physiological changes.
Model 4 indicates that each 1 point increase in anticipated
future health on the 10-point scale is associated with an age
identity that is 1 year younger. Of all the dimensions of health
examined, the largest mediating effects are found for pro-
spective self-rated health. The coefficients for education and
perceived financial well-being do not reach significance. In
other words, the less favorable predictions of one's health in the
future made by individuals of lower SES play a large role in
explaining their older identities.
Mediating effects also are observed with the addition of
perceived control over health (Model 5); however, the
magnitude of the effects varies across indicators of SES. The
coefficient for perceived financial well-being falls by 48%, but
the effect of education declines by only 13%. Not only are
subjective indicators of health part of the process linking SES
and age identity, but also the number of chronic conditions
plays a mediating role (Model 6); with the inclusion of chronic
conditions, the effect of education declines by 29% and
perceived financial well-being by 40%.
Model 7 indicates that, controlling for respondent's age,
those reporting a parent in poor health have age identities that
are approximately 1 year older on average than those of
respondents without a parent in poor health. Although the effect
of self-reported parents' health is significant, it is not part of the
process linking SES and age identity; the coefficients for the
socioeconomic variables change little with the addition of
parents' health into the model.
The last model in Table 2 includes all the health measures.
The effects of neither education nor financial well-being are
significant, indicating that the generally worse health of those
occupying lower socioeconomic positions accounts for their
older identities. Further, it is noted that the explained variance
increases by approximately 50%, reflecting the importance of
health in the construction of age identities.
Although not the central foci of this paper, several other
findings are noted. Comparative self-rated health and chronic

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND AGE IDENTITY S105
conditions mask the effect of gender on age identity.
Controlling for the worse self-rated health and more chronic
conditions experienced by women, it is found that they have
younger identities than men. Health is involved also in the
process linking race and age identity. In brief, race differences
in comparative self-rated health appear to play an important
role in explaining the younger identities reported by non-White
respondents. Contrary to the findings of other work (e.g.,
Mutchler & Burr, 1991), non-White respondents in the MIDUS
sample report significantly better comparative self-rated health
than White respondents.
Significant interactions of age with education (Table 3;
Model 1) and perceived financial well-being (Table 4; Model
1), but not household income (not shown), are found. As
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate, among younger respondents,
differences in age identity by level of education or financial
well-being are minimal. Wider differences are found among
older respondents.
In contrast to the main effects models (Table 2), health plays
a more limited role in explaining the wider socioeconomic
differences in age identity among older respondents. As
reported in the last column of Table 3, no change is observed
in the coefficient for the interactive effect of age and education

) when all health measures are added. Only one measure,
prospective self-rated health, exerts a mediating effect, and the
effect is fairly small. Health plays a larger role in explaining the
interactive effect of age and perceived financial well-being on
age identity. With all of the health measures included (Table 4;
Model 8), the coefficient for the interactive effect of age and
financial well-being (bap
) is reduced by 25%. Models entering
one health measure at a time reveal that chronic conditions and
prospective self-rated health are the components of health
acting as mediators. Prospective health, as found in the main
effects model (Table 2; Model 4), exerts a strong mediating
effect; with the inclusion of this health measure, the coefficient
for the interactive effect of age and perceived financial well-
being does not reach significance. Consistent with age patterns
in age identity observed across levels of education and financial
well-being, socioeconomic differences in prospective self-rated
health are greatest in later life.
DISCUSSION
Interpreting youthful constructions of one's age as a means
of enhancing self-esteem in a society valuing youth, the
findings of this study suggest that individuals of lower
socioeconomic strata, especially those in later life, are

disadvantaged not only by the objective conditions of their
lives but also by conceptions of their aging selves. The findings
are consistent with prior research revealing that the less
advantaged tend to have older identities than their more
privileged peers (e.g., Baum & Boxley, 1983; Markides &
Boldt, 1983). Moreover, the observation that health accounts
for the main effect of SES, as indicated by education and
perceptions of economic well-being, on age identity parallels
the patterns found in the only published work in which this
relationship could be examined, that of Mutran and Burke
(1979), which reports that self-rated health mediates the effect
of education on age identity. Because this prior work uses
a more indirect measure of age identity (i.e., an individual's
identification with characteristics stereotypically associated
with old age), the results of the present study indicate that
this pattern is also found for more direct measures of age
identity.
By examining multiple dimensions of health, this study
extends the literature by providing further clues about the
process through which one's position in systems of stratifica-
tion affects the subjective experience of aging. Although most
of the dimensions of health examined in this study emerge as
mediators of the main effect of SES on age identity, the
findings indicate that the less advantaged have older identities
primarily because they hold less optimistic views of their
health. Future work should give closer attention to the
processes of social comparison underlying this relationship.
How do individuals form predictions about their future health,
and how is this process shaped by socioeconomic position?
Immediate interpersonal environments and generalized images
of women and men in various life stages should be examined as
possible mechanisms through which individuals' socioeconom-
ic positions shape the assessments that they make of their
experiences of aging, including expectations of health declines.
In addition to illuminating the process through which SES
influences age identity, this study finds that socioeconomic
differences in age identity, as indicated by education and
perceived financial well-being, are greatest among older adults.
This pattern is consistent with the cumulative advantage and
disadvantage hypothesis that has been examined more
extensively in work on the objective experience of aging, such
as functional health (House et al., 1994) and income (O'Rand,
1996). The findings of this study suggest that the concept may
also be applicable to subjective dimensions of aging: Higher

SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND AGE IDENTITY S107
SES may result in the accumulation not only of material
advantages, but also social psychological resources that can
diminish the negative effects of aging in a youth-oriented
society. However, other interpretations of the findings are
plausible because the data are cross-sectional. Rather than
reflecting a process occurring as individual age, the youthful
identities and wide socioeconomic differences in age identity
observed among older respondents in this study may reflect
period or cohort effects; these patterns may describe today's
older adults but not future cohorts. Challenging this in-
terpretation, however, is the persistence of two social phe-
nomena, negative views of aging and economic inequality.
Although these trends suggest that youthful identities and
socioeconomic differences in health and age identity will be
found in future cohorts of older adults, answering this question
will require further investigation using longitudinal data.
The cross-sectional data used in this study introduce other
limitations. Although the findings suggest that health is part of
the process linking SES and age identity, causal order cannot be
determined by this study. In particular, there is likely to be
a reciprocal relationship between age identity and health; not
only does health affect age perceptions, but having a more
youthful identity may lead to behaviors, such as exercise, that
are health-enhancing. Nearly all reported work on age identity
uses cross-sectional data; longitudinal data will permit the
causal relationships to be more clearly identified.
Subsequent research on age identity also should examine
explanations for the stronger effect of SES on age identity in
later life. This study finds that, although health accounts for the
main effect of SES on age identity, it only partially explains the
observed age differences. Socioeconomic differences in age
identity are widest in later life, in part, because the
disadvantaged elderly have more chronic conditions and hold
more pessimistic views of their future health, compared with
their wealthier peers. In exploring possible explanations for the
observed age patterns, other hypotheses should be considered
that have been offered in the literature, in particular, those
hinging on social class differences in the timing of adult
transitions and the perceived losses associated with these
transitions.
