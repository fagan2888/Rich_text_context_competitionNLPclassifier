Introduction
Shyness is considered as a behavior leading to increase in
problems within an individual. It is a blend of fear that is
universally manifested across cultures (Weiner & Craighead,
2010). Shyness leads to inhibition among people and hinders
the process of achieving healthy interpersonal relationships
and professional goals (Henderson, Zimbardo, & Carducci,
2001). A shy individual tends to focus on self and is preoc-
cupied with thoughts of his own (Crozier, 2002). Shyness is
a psychological state that causes feelings of discomfort, lead-
ing to avoidance of social contact. Cheek, Melchior, and
Carpentieri (1986) defined it as ". . . the tendency to feel
tense, worried or awkward during social interactions, espe-
cially with unfamiliar people" (p. 115).
Shyness and sociability are two distinct personality traits
(Cheek & Buss, 1981). The degree of these varies from mild
social awkwardness to totally inhibiting social phobia
(Henderson & Zimbardo, 1998). In another study, Henderson
et al. (2001) reported that manifestation of shyness occurs at
various levels varying from cognitive level (e.g., excessive
negative evaluation of self), affective level (e.g., feelings of
anxiety), physiological level (e.g., arousal of sympathetic
nervous system) to behavioral level (e.g., failure to respond
appropriately), and may also be caused by various other situ-
ational cues. Some of the physical symptoms associated with
shyness include blushing, sweating, a pounding heart or
upset stomach, negative feelings about oneself, worries
about how others view them, and a tendency to withdraw
from social interactions.
Shy behavior could be triggered by a wide variety of
arousal cues (Henderson & Zimbardo, 1998). An individual
may feel shy while interacting with strangers or an authorita-
tive figure, while initiating conversation in a group setting,
or in performing a social action in unstructured group

Shyness, Self-Construal,
Extraversion­Introversion, Neuroticism,
and Psychoticism: A Cross-Cultural
Comparison Among College Students

Abstract
Shyness is considered as a universal phenomenon and its prevalence rates vary across cultures. This study aimed at comparing
the level of shyness, self-construal, and personality traits of extraversion, introversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism among
the college students from India, the host country, Africa; Iran; and Maldives, and Tibetan refugees in India (TRI), studying in
different colleges at Mysore, India. Two hundred students (100 men and 100 women), age ranging from 17 to 30 years, were
recruited based on stratified random sampling and were administered the Henderson/Zimbardo Shyness Questionnaire,
Fernandez Scale of Independent­Interdependent Self-Construal, and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire­Revised. The results
showed that shyness was significantly correlated with high introversion and high neuroticism scores. The results also showed
that level of shyness varies significantly across different cultural groups and students from Maldives showed highest level of
shyness whereas Iranian students had the lowest level of shyness. Although there was no significant gender difference, TRI
males and Maldivian females had higher scores on shyness. Faith Orientation did not differentiate the prevalence of shyness
among students of the different cultural groups. Shyness may be influenced by the culture from which one hails, and its level
may vary depending on the nurturance.

settings (D'Souza, Gowda, & Gowda, 2006). It could also be
caused when the individual has to develop a relationship
especially with individuals of opposite gender, in a one-
to-one situation (Natesha & D'Souza, 2008). Metaphorically,
shyness could be considered as shrinking back from life that
weakens the bonds of human connections (Henderson &
Zimbardo, 2010) affecting one's mind, body, and self as a
whole (Sinha, 2011).
Shy people are reported to be self-conscious and resist
pleasures because they believe that they tune out from the
social matrix (Schlenker & Weigold, 1990). To relate with
others, they find the computer-mediated communication to
be easier means than the face-to-face contact (Chan, 2011).
The privately self-conscious shy people emphasize more on
personal identity, whereas those who are publicly self-con-
scious emphasize on conformity, social identity, and social
trepidations (Wojslawowicz, 2005). Shy individuals prefer to
create an identity of being autonomous and will monitor and
control their self-presentations to construct a shy image for
audiences. However, the privately shy people control their
shy behavior and attitudes in public to protect their auton-
omy. Individuals with shyness are aware of their own absence
of social skills (Creed & Funder, 1998). As a result, they
avoid involving in social relationships and subsequent lone-
liness is high among them (Jackson, Soderlind, & Weiss,
2000). Mounts, Valentiner, Anderson, and Boswell (2006)
also found that high levels of shyness and low levels of
sociability are related to high levels of loneliness.
Shyness and Gender
Gender differences in shyness among male and female were
reported by several studies (Crozier, 1995; La Greca &
Lopez, 1998; Mandal, 2008; Stockli, 2002). In Indian con-
text, shyness is considered to be the quality of women, and if
any one lacks modesty and possesses more of a masculine
character, then she is considered to be a bold, brash, and non-
feminine being (Sinha, 2011). However, in a recent study by
Afshan, D'Souza, and Manickam (2014), no significant dif-
ference was found between adolescent boys and girls who
stayed in hostels and those who lived with their parents.
Studying the level of shyness of population from different
countries, Henderson and Zimbardo (1998) found no gender
difference and opined that men may have learnt typical tac-
tics to conceal shyness as they regard it as a feminine trait.
Shyness, Anxiety, and Phobia
There are several other variables that are studied in relation
to shyness. Clinically, shy individuals are reported to be
more prone to depression and anxiety (Crozier, 1995), and
they experience more amount of fear in their lives as well
(D'Souza et al., 2006). Several studies found positive corre-
lation between shyness and social phobia (Chavira, Stein, &
Malcarne, 2002; Heiser, Turner, & Beidel, 2003; Kamath &
Kenekar, 1993). Kamath and Kenekar (1993) also reported
that shy people with social phobia are more introverts and
neurotics than the shy people without social phobia.
Significant correlations were also found between shyness
and personality traits (Ebeling-Witte, Frank, & Lester, 2007).
Shyness and Personality Traits
Eysenck, Eysenck, and Barrett (1985) opined that an extro-
vert always tries to seek excitement in a social activity to
heighten the arousal level, whereas an introvert prefers to
keep such arousals at minimum level and hence they avoid
the social situations. Due to this behavior, they are recog-
nized as shy people and the terms introversion and shyness
are often used interchangeably in everyday language (Briggs,
1988). But as a construct, shyness is conceptually distinct
from the well-known dimensions of Extraversion (E),
Introversion (I), and Neuroticism (N) (Crozier, 1995). Shy
individuals experience uncomfortable feelings of self, espe-
cially in social situations. Introverts may appear to be shy,
because their desire to interact with others is low; however,
they are not worried about what others think of them and are
confident about their quietness (Asendorpf & Meier, 1993;
Coplan et al., 2013). However, Gray (1987), based on his
personality theory, explained that impulsive behavior as
shown by an individual could be due to the arousal of
Behavioral Activation System (BAS), whereas behaviors
of anxiety and inhibition are manifested due to activation of
Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS). Hence, individuals
whose BAS is motivated are more impulsive and outgoing,
whereas an individual who is motivated by BIS could experi-
ence shyness and anxiety.
The Concept of Self
The concept of self is a dynamic center of awareness, emo-
tions, judgment, and actions that are organized into a distinc-
tive whole and are set contrastively, against social and natural
background (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). The self of an indi-
vidual varies greatly depending on one's own culture (Rhee,
Uleman, Lee, & Roman, 1995). From the Western perspec-
tive, self is composed of individual attributes such as ambi-
tions, good humor, and extravert qualities (Trafimow,
Triandis, & Goto, 1991). Markus and Kitayama (1991) dif-
ferentiated two kinds of self: independent and interdepen-
dent. The independent self is viewed as a bounded entity. It is
more or less integrated, unique, and motivational. However,
the interdependent self is a sense of self that is more flexible
and is connected to the social context that emphasizes on
distinctive quality (Cross & Madson, 1997). Singelis (1994)
opined that these two images of self can coexist among indi-
viduals and they can be measured. People can best distin-
guishtheirownselfbydiscoveringuniquetalents(Kanagawa,
Cross, & Markus, 2001). Fernandez, Paez, and Gonzalez
(2005) reported that less interdependent quality and more
Afshan et al. 3
independent self-construal are characteristics that are more
typical of hierarchical cultures than of individualism.
Moreover, high interdependent quality and low independent
self-construal are characteristics more highly present in egal-
itarian cultures than in collectivist cultures.
The research in the West conceptualized self as an inde-
pendent functioning unit and defined independence as a fun-
damental task of socialization. However, people with
interdependent self perceived themselves as a part of an
encompassing social relationship (Kitayama, 1992).
Although the interdependent self is regarded as possessing a
set of internal qualities such as abilities and opinions of one-
self, these attributes are thought to be situation specific as
well as unstable rather than defining it as the characteristic of
self (Bochner, 1994). The self becomes meaningful and com-
plete only within the context of social relationship rather
than in relation to independent and autonomous actions.
Thus, interdependent self is not a bounded structure; instead
it changes its structure with regard to the nature of social
context (Kanagawa et al., 2001). The interdependent self was
related to cooperative cultural values, and the independent
self had more links to competitive cultures (Fernandez et al.,
2005).
Culture and Shyness
Many researchers have reported that shyness varies across
different cultures (Aizawa & Whatley, 2006; Chen, &
French, 2008; Sakuragi, 2004; Stockli, 2002; Vanaja, Latha,
& Bhaskara, 2004). Shyness is considered to be a negative
trait in the Western countries (Weisz et al., 1993). Studies
conducted in China showed that shyness is positively corre-
lated with peer acceptance in the age group of 8 to 10 years
(Chen, Rubin, & Sun, 1992). However, when they compared
with Canadian children of the same ages (Chen et al., 1992),
peer acceptance was negatively correlated with shyness. In
South Asian countries, shyness is considered to be a boon
because the societies expect to control oneself in front of oth-
ers and to respect social rank of others (Weisz et al., 1993).
Carducci and Zimbardo (1995) studied shyness across cul-
tures, including participants from India, Canada, Germany,
Israel, Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan. They found that the
extent of population experiencing shyness varied from 31%
to 55%. In India, as per the study, shyness was found to be
prevalent at 47%. The lowest was experienced in Israel and
the highest was reported in Japan.
Several cross-cultural studies had shown the direct effects
of culture on shyness (Carducci & Zimbardo, 1995; Kerr,
Lambert, & Bem, 1996; Maltby, Day, & Macaskill, 2007;
Stockli, 2002). The cultural context also influences the con-
nection between shyness, scholastic achievement, and social
popularity, as well as parental education among students
(Stockli, 2002). Carducci and Zimbardo (1995) explaining the
cultural differences in shyness made a distinction between col-
lectivistic cultures and individual cultures. Collectivist culture
promotes esteem of the group over that of the individual. As a
result, it fosters self-consciousness and shyness. In one of the
recent research conducted in India, Sinha (2011) observed that
the self-conscious and inhibited behaviors observed in shy
individuals are induced due to the cultural factors.
The present study attempted to compare the level of shy-
ness among individuals of various cultural groups: Indians,
the host; Africans; Iranians; Maldivians; and Tibetan refu-
gees in India (TRI). It also attempted to measure whether
age, gender, faith orientation, and other socio-demographic
variables have any relationship with shyness, self-construal,
extraversion, introversion, and neuroticism. How far shyness
is related to variables of extraversion, introversion, and neu-
roticism, as well as its relation to the level of independence
or interdependence, is also explored.
In the present study, shyness is operationally defined as a
psychological state that leads to feelings of discomfort,
resulting in avoidance of social encounters, especially with
strangers and is culturally determined.
Method
Sample
A total of 200 participants from five different cultural groups
studying at degree level in four different colleges of Mysore
city in India were selected using purposive sampling. Among
them, 80 participants were Indians, 30 were Iranians, 30
Africans,1 30 Maldivians, and 30 of them were TRI. Whereas
the TRI group was born and brought up in India, the partici-
pants from other nations have come to India for their educa-
tional purpose and have been in India only from the past 1 to
2 years. The sample was matched for gender, and they
belonged to the age group of 17 to 30 years. The mean age
for males and females being 22 years (SD = 3.47) and 21
years (SD = 3.64), respectively. The participants belonged to
different faith orientations as follows: 31 Hindus, 76
Muslims, 55 Christians, 30 Buddhists, and the remaining 8
did not mention their faith orientation. Regarding the educa-
tional course, 103 participants were studying arts subjects,
whereas 97 were pursuing science subjects.
Measures
The English versions of following scales were group admin-
istered to the participants:
Henderson/Zimbardo Shyness Questionnaire.The 35-items
questionnaire (Henderson & Zimbardo, 2001) measures the
level of shyness quotient (shy Q) experienced by individuals.
The items are to be rated on a 5-point rating scale ranging
from 1 to 5. A score of 1 indicated low level of shyness and a
score of 5 indicated high level of shyness. Cronbach's alpha
obtained for six different samples were reported to be
between .92 and .93 (Henderson & Zimbardo, 2001).
4 SAGE Open
Independent and Interdependent Scale of Self-Construal.This
13-item questionnaire (Fernandez et al., 2005) is the modi-
fied version of the original Singelis (1994) scale of indepen-
dence and interdependence. This tool measures the
interdependent and independent quality of an individual. The
items of both the interdependent scale (group loyalty and
relational interdependence) and the independent scale
(uniqueness and low context) are grouped into two factors.
Items were rated using a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (totally
disagree) to 4 (totally agree). The reliability of the scale was
reported to be .61 for group loyalty, .39 for relational interde-
pendence, .51 for uniqueness, and .37 for low context.
Eysenck Personality Questionnaire­Revised (EPQ-R).This is a
100-item scale (Eysenck et al., 1985) that was developed and
revised over a period of 50 years (Francis, Lewis, & Ziebertz,
2006). It measures extraversion, introversion, neuroticism,
and psychoticism. This is a reliable research tool that is vali-
dated in the Indian population (Abraham & Varghese, 1990),
and both vernacular as well as English versions are used for
research (Manickam, 1996).
Results
The socio-demographic data of the sample are shown in
Table 1. One-way ANOVA was conducted between depen-
dent variables (shyness, extraversion, introversion, neuroti-
cism, psychoticism, and independent­interdependent
self-construal) and independent variables (culture, age, gen-
der, education, and faith orientation). The variables that were
significant in one-way ANOVA were further subjected to
two-way analysis to determine the interaction effect between
them. There was no significant difference observed in rela-
tion to faith orientation.
As observed in Table 2, the level of shyness varied signifi-
cantly between cultural groups, F(4, 190) = 4.179, p = .003.
Maldivian participants (M = 3.17, SD = 0.86) reported sig-
nificantly high levels of shyness compared with the partici-
pants from other nations. Significant difference was found
between shyness and educational course, F(1, 190) = 10.08,
p = .002. Arts students (M = 2.81, SD = 0.53) reported sig-
nificantly lower level of shyness than science students (M =
3.05, SD = 0.65). Although no significant gender difference
was found in relation to shyness, the interaction effect of
gender and cultural groups on shyness was found to be sig-
nificant F(4, 190) = 3.058, p = .018. TRI males (M = 3.29,
SD = 0.73) and Maldivian females (M = 3.21, SD = 0.91)
showed higher level of shyness, and African males (M =
2.58, SD = 0.45) and Iranian females (M = 2.59, SD = 0.40)
showed lower levels of shyness. The interaction effect
between cultural groups and education on shyness were also
significant F(4, 190) = 3.894, p = .005. Participants who are
in arts courses from Africa (M = 3.00 SD = 0.59) had high
score of shyness, whereas their counterparts from Iran (M =
2.42, SD = 0.40) had low scores. Participants who are in sci-
ence courses from Maldives (M = 3.35, SD = 0.78) had high
level of shyness, and those from Africa had low level (M =
2.75, SD = 0.58) of shyness.
Independent­interdependent self-construal did not differ
with different cultural groups (Table 3). However, age
showed significant differences with independent self-con-
strual, F(1, 190) = 3.965, p = .048. Higher age group showed

higher degree of Independent self-construal (M = 2.96, SD =
0.48) when compared with lower age groups (M = 2.77, SD
= 0.46). However, interdependent self-construal was not
affected by age. The interaction effect between independent
and interdependent self-construal, cultural groups, and age
was also not significant.
Analyzing the personality traits of cultural groups and
education (Table 4), only education and extraversion showed
significant differences, F(1, 190) = 126.6, p = .000. Although
participants from arts courses were found to be more extra-
verts (M = 15.46, SD = 2.363) compared with those from
science courses (M = 11.10, SD = 2.316), the interaction
effect between cultural groups and educational course was
not significant.
Furthermore, correlation coefficients were computed to
analyze the relationship between the study variables. Shyness
was negatively correlated with extraversion (r = -.227, p <
.01; Table 5), and it was positively correlated with neuroti-
cism (r = .447, p < .01) as well as with interdependent self-
construal (r = .248, p < .01). There was no correlation between
shyness and psychoticism. The Independent­Interdependent
sub-scales of self-construal correlated positively (r = .190, p
< .01) with each other. A positive correlation was observed
between the interdependent self-construal with relational
interdependent (r =.503, p < .01), group loyalty (r = .824, p <
.01), low context (r = .224, p < .01), and uniqueness (r = .188,
p < .01). A positive correlation was also found between inde-
pendent self-construal with relational interdependence (r =
.205, p < .01), low context (r = .593, p < .01), and uniqueness
(r = .619, p < .01).
Discussion
The study was intended to find the differences in shyness
levels of the students from different cultural groups and
found that Maldivian students were shyer compared with the
students of other cultural groups under study. Hofstede
(1983) viewed that every nation provides a symbolic value to
its inhabitant and every individual derives their identity from
this symbolic value. This identity among them creates a
sense of belongingness toward their nation, and it also affects
their thoughts. The diversity in their thoughts may be affected
by early life experiences in family, differences in family
background, and parenting (Aunola & Nurmi, 2005), as well
as the later educational experiences in schools and organiza-
tions, which are not same across the national borders
(Hofstede, 1983). Apart from these factors, differences
within the culture may also play a role, directly or indirectly,
in inducing shyness.
As shyness interferes in every aspect of an individual's
life, its existence has direct effects even in selecting the
courses of education (Woolnough, 1994), as well as on the
academic and scholastic performances (D'Souza, Urs, &
Jayaraju, 2008). The present study revealed that the partici-
pants belonging to science courses were shyer and less extro-
verts compared with those studying arts courses. The art

students by virtue of the nature of the curriculum are made to
actively participate in programs that require more interaction
with people around and that could be one of the reasons for
them to be less shy.
Factors such as faith orientation and culture affect the
development and persistence of certain behaviors and ideas
of self (Chen, French, & Schneider, 2006). Kitayama,
Karasawa, Curhan, Ryff, and Markus (2010) reported that
the age factor affects both the independent and interdepen-
dent self-construal. However, we found that the age factor
slightly affected the thoughts of independent self-construal
but not the interdependent self-construal. The same observa-
tion was made by previous research (Matsumoto, 1999). He
observed that interdependence is the quality found among
people living in collectivist culture and their thoughts were
not affected by the age factor. They prefer to be interdepen-
dent and create a sense of oneness within them. However,
people of independent cultures create a sense of indepen-
dence within themselves with their growing age and experi-
ences of life.
Independent­interdependent self-construal was not found
to vary among the different cultures. The probable explana-
tion is that when students are exposed to a culture other than
their own, they try to change their thinking and behavior
according to the requirements of new environment, which
leads to similarities in the ideas and thoughts of the host cul-
ture (Cross & Madson, 1997). Probably, the new environ-
ment demands team building qualities of the students that
would have helped them excel in extracurricular activities
and academically. Furthermore, the prior knowledge about
the culture of the host country guides them to accept the dif-
ferences in the values, beliefs, and principles of that culture
leading to being independent.
It was found that shyness was negatively correlated with
extraversion and positively correlated with neuroticism.
Several studies also found that the low levels of inherent shy-
ness are significantly related to high levels of extraversion
(Briggs, 1988; Kamath & Kenekar, 1993; Lawrence &
Bennett, 1992). One of the studies conducted among physi-
cal education students in India also found shyness to be posi-
tively related to neuroticism. The outgoing potentials of
extraverts are not present in shy individuals who find it very
difficult, even to start a conversation and to maintain it. It is
also possible that those with high extraversion and having
more independent self-construal may have desired to leave
their home country and dared to study in a nation that is cul-
turally different from their own.
Limitations
The findings of the study cannot be generalized because ade-
quate representation was not given to the different cultural
groups. The TRI sample included in the study grew up in
India, and hence, they would have imbibed the cultural val-
ues and may possess similar qualities as that of the Indian
participants. Probably, using a measurement tool to assess
the cultural values would have helped differentiate between
the cultural groups.
Another limitation was that the cultural group that repre-
sented Africa had participants from different nations of the
African continent, which in fact may be a divergent group in
itself. Considering the participants from different nations
from a continent as a single group may also have vitiated this
particular group. Future studies may be conducted compar-
ing the present study variables of students who are studying
in India with their counterparts who are in their home
countries.
Conclusion
The present study found that shyness varies within different
cultural groups and could be influenced by the culture from
which an individual hails. However, the faith orientation to
which one belongs does not influence the level of shyness.

There are no gender differences found, and the gender differ-
ences that were reported earlier do not exist now. The persis-
tence of shyness affects one's personality trait and ideas of
self, making him or her appear to be neurotic and withdrawn,
even though the shy individual wishes to be more socially
active. Probably, when an individual migrates from his or her
native to other countries for the purpose of education, he or
she learns to be independent and less shy.
