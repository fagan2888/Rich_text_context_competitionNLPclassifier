ABSTRACT
The influence oflow doses ofguaiacol and ethanol, the natural effectors oflignin
and phenolics transformations, on laccase and peroxidase activities produced by
two strains of Basidiomycetes, Pleurotus sajor-caju and Trametes versicolor, was evalu-
ated. Fungal mycelia were grown for 2 weeks on liquid media containing serial
dilutions of guaiacol or ethanol ranging from 100-1 to 100-20 mol/L. Laccase and
peroxidase activities in the medium were measured at the end of2 weeks. The effect
of low doses of guaiacol and ethanol on enzyme activities was manifested in an
oscillating manner. Similar response patterns were observed when pure enzymes
were exposed to the same serial dilutions of guaiacol and ethanol. T uersicolor
cultures enriched with 40 mmol guaiacol (simulating natural environmental condi-
tions) also displayed oscillating enzyme activity patterns in response to serial dilu-
tions ofguaiacol, but the maximum enzyme activity values were increased compared
to those observed in cultures not receiving 40 mmol guaiacol. The differences
between maxima and minima varied among the experimental groups and de-
pended on the species of fungus, type of effector, and kind of enzyme. The results
suggest the possibility of subtle regulation of enzymatic activity on the molecular
level.
Key Words: laccase, peroxidase, Pleurotus sajor-caju, Trametes versicolor, ethanol,
guaiacol, low doses.
INTRODUCTION
The activities ofenzymes catalyzing al\ metabolic pathways are in part regulated by
low molecular effectors (Bonne 1997). Physiological events in cel\s are also regulated

with the help of low molecular substances that influence the activity of respective
receptors or enzymes in the metabolic pathway and regulate the speed of substrate
flow by these pathways. The concentration of effectors is very important for initiation
of even ts such as the activation of chemoreceptors or cascade of apoptotic processes
in humans (Calabrese 2001a,b,c), as well as mechanisms of biochemical immuniza-
tion in plants (Manniger et al. 1998; Katay and Tyihak 1998; Tyihak et al: 2002).
Rapoport and Luebering (1951) reported that diphosphoglycerate phosphatase
is strongly activated by low concentrations of potential metabolic poisons, Hg(lI) or
Ag(l) ions. In 1964 Dixon and Webb reported that some effectors can act as poisons
for some enzymes and activators for others. More recently, bimodal types of regu-
lation of tyrosine kinase by low doses of the inhibitor genistein (Morimoto and
Bonavida 1992) and of protein kinase C by very low concentration of some antioxi-
dants (Maltseva 2002) have been described.
" Effectors are usually divided into activators and inhibitors, but according to the
hormetic principle the concept of activation and inhibition is strongly dependent
on the concentration of effectors and their time of action (Calabrese and Baldwin
2000 and 2001a).
Fungi were chosen as the experimental model because they can be grown on
various substrates and produce large amounts of extracellular enzymes, such as
laccase and peroxidase, which cause the white rot of wood and are involved with the
process of enzymatic delignification (Leonowicz et al. 1999; Luterek et al: 1998;
Malarczyk and Widenska 2002). These enzymes are sensitive to the presence ofvarious
small molecular effectors that regulate the reactions involving the biodegradation of
lignin and transformation ofnatural phenolics (Molitoris, 2001; Malarczyk etal: 2001).
Many aromatic substances, mainly alcohols, aldehydes and acids such as ferulic,
vanillic, and anisic are substrates for laccase. The induction oflaccase is also possible
with the same natural aromatic activators or similar synthetic substances such as 2,5-
xylidin (Rogalski and Leonowicz 1992). Peroxidase, which requires H2
0 2
as a co-
substrate, is often activated by the same substances. This article describes the effects
of very low doses of guaiacol and ethanol on the activity of extracellular laccase and
peroxidase in the liquid cultures oftwo fungi, Trametes versicolorand Pleurotus sajor-caju.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pure Enzymes
Cerrerut unicolorlaccase was purified in the Biochemistry Department, MCS Uni-
versity in Lublin according to the procedure described by Luterek et al: (1998).
Horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Sigma Chemical Company.
Biological Models and Culture Conditions
Two species of fungi from the fungi collection of the Biochemistry Department,
M.C.S. University, Lublin, Poland (i.e., strains Trametes versicolor, designated No. 20
and Pleurotussnjor-caiu, designated No. 100 in the collection) were used as biological
168 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.2, 2003-
Honnetic Effect of Guaiacol and Ethanol on Enzymatic Activity of Fungi
sources oflaccase and peroxidase. Fungal mycelia were inoculated on the Lindeberg
medium according to the method described by Luterek et at. (1998). After 10 days,
the mycelia were homogenized with glass beads. Small conical flasks containing 10
ml medium were inoculated with the homogenate (0.5 ml homogenate/flask).
Twenty-one flasks (a control and 20 serial dilutions of enzyme) were used in each
experiment. Each experiment was replicated three times.
Preparation of Dilution and Stimulation Course
Serial dilutions (one part effector solution to 99 part'! 75% ethanol) were pre-
pared from solutions of guaiacol and ethanol (initial concentrations of 0.3 mol/L
and 16 mol/L, respectively). The concentrations of the serial dilutions ranged from
100-1 to 100-20 mol/L [see Zenin's refractometric studies (Zenin 1999a,b) for an
explanation of molecular changes that may occur at ultra high dilutions]. Twenty III
of serial dilutions were added to the cultures every second day, beginning on day 3
of the experiment (a total o£120 Ill/flask over the course of the 14-day experiment).
Control cultures received after 14 days a total amount 120 Ill/flask of 75% ethanol
only. For experiments with pure enzymes, 200 III of serial dilutions were added to
each flask containing 200 III of purified laccase or peroxidase in 700 III of proper
buffer and enzyme activities were measured at the end of 1 hour.
Enzyme Assays
Laccase activity was measured spectrophotometrically using syringaldazine (2.5 1lM)
as the substrate in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.2 according to the method
ofLeonowicz and Grzywnowicz (1981). Peroxidase activity was measured using 4 IlM
of o-dianisidine in methanol and 10 mmoles of H
2
0
2
as the substrate and co-
substrate, respectively, in 0.1 M acetate-Na buffer, pH 5.5 according to the method
of Claiborne and Fridovich (1979). Enzyme activities were expressed in nkatals
where one nkatal is defined as the enzymatic degradation of one nmole ofsubstrate
during 1 sec and one international unit of enzymatic activity correspond to 16.67
nkatals.
Statistical Analysis
The results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA using the software package
STATGRAPHICS version 2.6. Line regressing analyses were performed for the data
from all 14 experiments presented in Table 1 and Figures 1 to 4. Trend lines are
showed in all figures with proper equations. The values of maximal and minimal
points (lying above or below the trend lines) were summarized and put in Figure 5
to illustrate how various dilutions of guaiacol and ethanol can work to activate and
inhibit laccase and peroxidase activities (see also ]a\jock and Lewis, 2002).
RESULTS
Oscillatory changes were observed in laccase and peroxidase activities in the
media of both fungal species exposed to serial dilutions of guaiacol and ethanol.

Figure 5. Comparative analysis for the data from all 14 experiments presented in Table 1 and Figures 1 to 4. Trend lines are showed in all
these figures and the values ofmaximal and minimal points (lying above or below the trend lines) were summarized to illustrate the
activating or inhibiting possibilities of various dilutions of guaiacol and ethanol against laccase and peroxidase activities.
Malarczyk et al.
The oscillations were characterized by a similar number of maximal and minimal
levels of activity (Figures 1 and 2, Table 1 no. 1 to 8).
Similar oscillatory changes were observed in 40 mmol guaiacol-enriched cultures
of T versirulorexposed to serial dilutions ofguaiacol. However, the distance between
the maximal and minimal activity values increased more dramatically. For peroxi-
dase it reached approximately 2570 nkatals (Figure 3, Table 1 no. 9) and for laccase
it reached up to 5870 nkatals (Figure 3, Table 1 no. 10). The corresponding values
for non-activated cultures of T versicolorwere approximately 680 nkatals for peroxi-
dase and 1030 nkatals for laccase.
Oscillatory changes were also observed in solutions of purified laccase and
peroxidase, although the distance between the maximal and minimal activity values
were much lower compared to those obtained from the fungal culture media (i.e.,
for peroxidase the distance between maximum and minimum did not exceed 90
nkatals (Figure 4 C and D, Table 1 no. 11 and 12) and for laccase the distance did
not exceed 40 nkatals (Figure 4 A and B, Table 1 no. 13 and 14). The frequency of
oscillations in enzymatic activity, however, was similar to that observed for the
enzymes in fungal cultures.
Figure 5 represents an assessment of the combined data for the 14 different
experiments and indicates the most likely probability of observing a maximal enzy-
matic activity.
DISCUSSION
Guaiacol and ethanol are found in the natural environment and essential for the
metabolism of the fungi Trametes and Pleurotus. Increasing dilutions ofboth effectors
showed the exponential dependence between the enzymatic protein reaction and
the effector's concentration. The oscillatory character of activity changes was ob-
served for both enzymes in showing systematically repeated frequencies (Figure 5),
indicating the tendency of some effector's dilutions to stimulate the enzyme activity
while other dilutions inhibit.
It should be emphasized that in all experimental conditions the oscillatory
patterns were similar. However, the distance between maximum and minimum of
activity did vary among the experimental groups and depended on the species of
fungus, type of effector and kind of enzyme. Generally, the laccase activity level in
the Trametes cultures was always higher than that in the Pleurotus cultures, which had
an effect on the distance between the maximum and minimum activity values.
Guaiacol showed a greater stimulation of laccase activity in both Trametes and
Pleurotus cultures, whereas ethanol showed a greater stimultaion of peroxidase
activity in the Pleurotus cultures.
In the case of Trametes cultures enriched with 40 mmol of guaiacol, statistically
significant (p=0.05; see Figure 3) increases in the activities of both enzymes were
observed in response to serial dilutions of guaiacol. Maximum laccase activity
increased to approximately 8000 nkatals compared with 504 nkatals in the control
176 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.2, 2003.
Hormetic Effect of Guaiacol and Ethanol on Enzymatic Activity of Fungi
cultures. Maximum peroxidase activity increased to 4250 nkatals compared to 54
nkatals in the control cultures. It is conceivable that this activation can take place
in nature in in vivo conditions during fungal growth. Low concentrations ofguaiacol
may be generated during fungal metabolism of various phenol substances.
Changes in activity of both enzymes (Table 1) assume the shape of the letters
J or U described as characteristic of hormesis (Calabrese 2001). The occurrence
of oscillatory patterns of enzyme activation/inhibition in response to effectors
should be examined for other species of fungi and other enzymes. The findings
reported here suggest the possibility of subtle regulation of enzymatic activity on
the molecular level and clarification of these processes should be the focus of
future research.
