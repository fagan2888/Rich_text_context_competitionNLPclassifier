Abstract
ADAIR, LINDA S. Dramatic rise in overweight and obesity
in adult Filipino women and risk of hypertension. Obes Res.
2004;12:1335­1341.
Objective: To assess trends in BMI of adult Filipino women
over a 16-year period of rapid socioeconomic change; to
identify factors associated with those trends; and to estimate
the risk of hypertension associated with overweight, obe-
sity, and high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).
Research Methods and Procedures: Women from ran-
domly selected urban and rural communities of Metro Cebu,
Philippines were recruited during a 1983 to 1984 index
pregnancy, then followed prospectively for 16 years. Over-
weight and obesity were defined using BMI cut-off points
of 25 and 30, respectively. The analysis sample included
women 15 to 45 years of age when measured 4 months
postpartum. Weight change in subsequent intervals from
1985 to 1999 was modeled using linear regression. The
relationship of BMI and WHR to risk of hypertension in the
last survey was modeled using logistic regression.
Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity com-
bined increased nearly 6-fold from 6% in 1983 to 1984 to
35% in 1998 to 1999. Weight gain was positively associated
with urban residence, improved socioeconomic status,
fewer pregnancies and months of lactation, and more away-
from-home work hours. Risk of hypertension was indepen-
dently elevated by high WHR and overweight/obesity.
Discussion: The dramatic trend of increasing overweight
and obesity in this sample of women represents a serious
health concern, especially in light of the strong association
of excess weight, particularly in the truncal region, to risk of
hypertension.

Introduction
Worldwide trends of increasing obesity in adults are well
recognized (1) and have recently become a focus of the
World Health Organization, as reflected in a recent Expert
Technical Consultation (2). Increases in mean BMI and
prevalence of overweight are of special concern in Asia
because comorbidities tend to occur at lower BMI in Asians
(3,4). Dramatic trends of increasing obesity are contributing
to higher prevalence of noncommunicable disease morbid-
ity and mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease
and type 2 diabetes. It has been estimated that 30 million
people in the Asia-Pacific region suffer from type 2 diabetes
(5). In the Philippines, 1996 data show that diseases of the
circulatory system accounted for 30% of all deaths (6). A
recent national nutrition survey revealed that 21% of all
adults and 44.3% of adults over the age of 60 were hyper-
tensive (7). Given the importance of overweight as a risk
factor for these diseases, further research is needed to iden-
tify the factors responsible for the rapid and dramatic trends
in obesity prevalence in the Philippines and in other coun-
tries undergoing rapid development.
Most data on overweight and obesity trends in developing
countries come from cross-sectional national surveys. There
is little information on weight trends derived from longitu-
dinal studies within populations, nor are there adequate data
on how trends relate to chronic disease.
This study examined a cohort of Filipino women who
were participants in an ongoing longitudinal health and
nutrition study in Metro Cebu. The main objectives of the
study were to assess trends in BMI of adult Filipino women

over a 16-year period of rapid socioeconomic change, iden-
tify factors associated with those trends, and determine how
overweight and obesity status affect the risk of hypertension
at the end of this interval.
Research Methods and Procedures
Data were collected during the ongoing Cebu Longitudi-
nal Health and Nutrition Survey. This study is being con-
ducted in Metro Cebu, which encompasses the large city of
Cebu, proximate smaller cities and surrounding rural moun-
tainous areas, and several smaller island communities.
Metro Cebu has a population of nearly 2 million and is the
fastest growing metropolitan area of the Philippines. In
1983, all pregnant women living in 33 randomly selected
urban and rural communities of Metro Cebu were identified
through a census and asked to participate in the study. Those
who gave birth during a 1-year time period from 1983 to
1984 were enrolled in the study (n  3327). Compared with
the general population of women of childbearing age in
Metro Cebu, sample women had higher fertility.
Women were interviewed and measured once during
pregnancy, within 6 days after giving birth, bimonthly for 2
years after giving birth, then in 1991, 1994 to 1995, and
1998 to 2000. For convenience, we refer to the 1984, 1991,
1994, and 1999 surveys. At the time of recruitment, women
ranged in age from 15 to 45 years, and 21% were primi-
gravida. The analysis sample for each time interval includes
women who were not pregnant when measured and, thus,
varies across the intervals. Loss to follow-up was more
likely among urban women and women with lower educa-
tion and parity at baseline. However, women lost to fol-
low-up did not differ from those in the analysis sample in
baseline weight, height, or age.
Data were collected by highly trained local field staff
during in-home interviews. Height was measured to the
nearest 0.1 cm using portable stadiometers; weight was
measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using portable scales; triceps
skinfold thickness was measured to the nearest 1 mm using
Harpenden calipers; and waist, hip, and midarm circumfer-
ences were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using standard
measuring tapes. Diet was assessed by 24-hour recall as-
sisted by local food models for the 1983, 1994, and 1999
surveys and by quantitative food frequency questionnaire in
the 1991 survey. Energy and nutrient intakes were estimated
using Filipino food composition tables produced by the
Food and Nutrition Research Institute. Individual, house-
hold, and community environment, socioeconomic, and demo-
graphic data were collected using detailed questionnaires.
Blood pressure (BP)1 was measured while participants
were seated and rested. The mean of three measurements,
taken using mercury sphygmomanometers, was used in the
analysis. BP was classified according to the most recent
guidelines, defining prehypertension (systolic BP 120 to
139 or diastolic BP 80 to 89), stage 1 hypertension (systolic
BP 140 to 159 or diastolic BP 90 to 99), and stage 2
hypertension (systolic BP 160 or diastolic BP 100) (8).
For the main analysis, weight status was defined using BMI
cut-off points of 18.5, 25, and 30 to define underweight,
overweight, and obesity, respectively, as recommended by the
World Health Organization and the International Obesity Task
Force. High waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was defined as a value
of 0.85 or greater. At the baseline survey, 4% of respondents
were 18 years of age, so adult cut-off points have the poten-
tial to misclassify them. However, none of the younger respon-
dents was overweight or obese. Unfortunately, there are no
BMI cut-off points for adolescents that represent the equivalent
of 18.5 for adults. Thus, we may have misclassified as
underweight a small percentage of participants who were still
teens when they first joined the study. Sensitivity analysis
shows that removal of the teen sample (those 18 years of
age) from the sample does not substantively change the results,
so they are retained to maximize the sample size. Weight
change was calculated for each measurement interval (1984 to
1991, 1991 to 1994, and 1994 to 1999). For the first interval,
initial weight was represented by the 4-month postpartum
measure for all women. For subsequent intervals, it was not
possible to measure all women at the same point postpartum
because reproductive patterns were quite heterogeneous after
the index pregnancy. Time allocation, which may serve as a
proxy for physical activity of the women, was assessed by
questionnaires that asked about usual activities over the course
of a day. Time spent in domestic work, leisure, and work for
pay was cumulated. Directly comparable time allocation data
were available for only 1994 and 1999; therefore, a separate
analysis focused on weight change in this period.
From detailed reproductive histories, summary variables
were created to represent the number of pregnancies and
months of lactation in each interval. In addition, indicator
variables were used to represent lactation status when a
woman was weighed. Socioeconomic status (SES) was rep-
resented by a summary index taking values of 1 to 8,
reflecting household income, possession of key assets (tele-
vision, electric fan, refrigerator), and type of house con-
struction materials (light, medium, strong). Detailed occu-
pation data were collected, and occupations were assigned a
three-digit code developed by the Philippines Department of
Labor. Occupations were then crudely categorized accord-
ing to physical work demands as primarily sedentary (pre-
dominantly carried out sitting) or more active.
Analysis
First, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the
sample through time is described, and univariate statistics
for groups defined by weight status are presented. To com-
pare age vs. secular trends in weight, the data from all time

periods were pooled into a longitudinal model, the effects of
age were examined while controlling for year of measure-
ment, and the interaction of age with year of measurement
was tested. Multiple linear regression was used to identify
factors significantly associated with change in weight dur-
ing each measurement interval. Finally, the odds of the three
different levels of hypertension (prehypertension and stages
1 and 2 hypertension) associated with weight status and WHR
were estimated using multinomial logistic regression, adjusting
for age, and predicted probability of hypertension at specified
levels of BMI and WHR was calculated. Diet, socioeconomic
status, place of residence, and proxy variables for physical
activity were assessed, but because they were not confounders
of the relationship of weight status and WHR to hypertension,
they were not included in final hypertension models. Predicted
probability of each hypertension outcome was calculated for
combinations of weight status and high WHR.
Results
Table 1 shows characteristics of women by weight cate-
gory in 1999. Prevalence of overweight and obesity were
higher among women with more education and higher so-
cioeconomic status, as evidenced by the overall index and
by possession of specific assets that indicate more wealth
and modernization. Underweight women were character-
ized by less work away from home and higher domestic
work burdens. Overweight and obese working women were
more likely to have sedentary occupations.
Age and Time Trends
Figure 1 shows trends in prevalence of underweight,
overweight, and obesity over the 16-year study period.
Underweight declined from a high of 24% in 1986 to 10%
in 1999. In contrast, overweight prevalence increased
5-fold, and although obesity was nearly absent in 1984 to
1986, nearly 7% of women were obese in 1999. Although
the mean weight change over the 16-year period was 6.8 
7.1 kg, there was considerable heterogeneity in weight
change patterns. Approximately seventy-two percent of
women gained 2 kg, 18% maintained weight within 2 kg,
and nearly 10% lost 2 kg. Weight change was accompa-
nied by changes in triceps skinfold thickness (mean increase
of 5.6  4.5 mm), with each kilogram of weight gain being
associated with a 1-mm increase in triceps skinfold.
Younger women gained significantly more weight than
older women: for example, as shown in Figure 2, women

age 20 to 29 years at baseline gained, on average for the
entire observation period, 2.8 kg more than women who
were 30 years or older. In addition to differences associated
with aging, there is also evidence of a secular trend. Models
estimated from pooling the data from all time periods show
that age, age squared, and year of measurement were each
highly significant predictors of weight. The highest rate of
weight gain occurred between 1986 and 1991 in all age
groups; however, women who were 30 years of age or older
in 1984 had smaller weight increases in this and subsequent
intervals. Because this is a mixed age cohort, time trends in
weight status of women of the same age cannot be com-
pared across the full age distribution. However, it is possible
to compare women in the middle of the age distribution.
Women who were 30 to 35 years old in 1991 weighed 4
kg more than women who were 30 to 35 years old in 1984.
The study period was marked by substantial changes in
socioeconomic status of Cebu households. Figure 3 shows
positive trends in the percentage of households that have
electrical service and selected appliances. The trend in over-
weight and obesity paralleled the changes in socioeconomic
indicators, with the sharpest increases occurring in the pe-
riod from 1984 to 1991.
Diet composition also changed over time. For the three
surveys when energy intake was comparably assessed using
24-hour dietary recalls, total grams of daily fat intake in-
creased, and percentage of energy from fat increased from
11.6% in 1984 to 17% in 1999 (Figure 4).
From 1994 to 1999, mean daily leisure time remained
fairly constant (2.97  2.04 and 3.07  1.94 h/d in 1994
and 1999, respectively), whereas mean time spent in do-
mestic labor including childcare declined from 5.28  2.70
to 4.33  2.41 h/d. Mean work hours remained the same,
but different women contributed to the mean at each point in
time. Mean hours of work away from home decreased by
0.75 h/d among women who worked away from home at
both points in time (from 7.00  3.27 to 6.24  2.94 h/d).
Determinants of Weight Change
Multivariate models were estimated to identify factors
associated with weight change in each time interval. An

additional model for 1994 to 1999 included changes in time
allocation. Results are summarized in Table 2. Across all of
the time periods, maternal age was inversely associated with
weight change. The total number of pregnancies and months
breast-feeding during the 1984 to 1991 interval were in-
versely associated with weight change in that time interval.
A higher proportion of mothers had young infants in this
interval compared with subsequent intervals. In subsequent
intervals, breast-feeding at the time of measurement at the
end (but not at the beginning) of the interval was inversely
associated with weight change. Number of pregnancies and
total time breast-feeding during the interval were not sig-
nificantly associated with weight change after 1991.
Increased dietary energy intake was positively associated
with weight gain except in the 1991 to 1994 period. Improve-
ments in economic status were consistently associated with
greater weight increases, as was urban residence. The effects of
change in SES were not dependent on the starting level of SES.
The main aspect of time allocation related to weight change
was work away from home, which was associated with higher
weight gain from 1994 to 1999. This is consistent with results
presented in Table 1, which show higher mean away-from-
home work hours in overweight women.
Risk Factors for Hypertension
One health consequence of these weight trends was eval-
uated by examining the likelihood of hypertension (based
on 1999 data) associated with overweight, obesity, and high
WHR. Results from logistic regression models with BMI 
25 as the reference category are presented in Table 3.
Looking across the levels of hypertension, the risks associ-
ated with excess body weight are readily apparent, with
obesity increasing the risk of stages 1 and 2 hypertension by
6 fold. The risk associated with a high WHR increased
across categories, from a nonsignificant 16% increase in
risk of prehypertension to a 2.5-fold increase in risk of stage
2 hypertension. Figure 5 shows the age-adjusted predicted
prevalence of hypertension for each weight and WHR cat-
egory. The highest predicted prevalence of stages 1 and 2
hypertension is found in association with the combination of
obesity and high WHR. Risk of hypertension was not sig-
nificantly related to triceps skinfold thickness, after control-
ling for weight status (data not shown).
Discussion
This study documented a dramatic trend of increasing over-
weight and obesity in a cohort of adult Filipino women over a
16-year period. The rise in overweight and obesity paralleled
rapid economic change evidenced by increasing household
incomes and ownership of consumer goods and a shift toward
higher fat diets, more sedentary jobs, and reduced domestic
work burdens. The incidence and prevalence of overweight
and obesity was highest among women in higher socioeco-

nomic households. This is consistent with findings from other
developing countries that are relatively early in the nutrition
transition (9,10). Overweight and obesity are also increasing
among women in poorer households, although levels have not
reached those of women in more affluent households. An
increase in overweight among the poor is also occurring in
countries such as Brazil (11). In comparison with the rest of the
Philippines, rates of overweight and obesity are higher in the
younger women of the Cebu sample but comparable in older
women. National survey data show that 16.7% of women 20 to
39 years old (vs. 29.6% in Cebu) and 24.5% (vs. 28.3% in
Cebu) of women 40 to 59 years old are overweight, whereas
4.0% (vs. 7.0% in Cebu) and 5.4% (vs. 6.4% in Cebu) in these
respective age groups are obese (7). The Cebu sample cannot
be considered representative of all women because we origi-
nally selected pregnant women for inclusion in the study.
Comparative data for other developing countries are sparse.
Bell et al. (12) have reported a doubling of overweight (from
10.4% to 20.8%) and a 7-fold increase in obesity (from 0.2%
to 1.5%) in an 8-year period in adult Chinese women who were
20 to 45 years of age at first observation. Another study of
Chinese women, 40 to 70 years old, has based estimates of
weight gain on recalled weight at age 20 (13). In the group
roughly comparable in age with our Cebu sample, mean
weight gain over 20 years was 9.1 kg (compared with 6.8 kg
in 16 years among Cebu women).
An important strength of this study is that it was based on
prospective data collection and, therefore, could separate
secular and age trends and identify potential causal relation-
ships. Age and year were both significant predictors of
weight, affirming that women are getting heavier with age
and heavier over time, irrespective of age. However, the
effects of the secular trend were greater in younger women,
and in each measurement interval, younger women gained
more weight than older women.
Reproductive Stresses
This is a high fertility population, with a mean of 5.5
pregnancies in the sample women. Weight gain is related to the
level of reproductive stress. In the 1984 to 1991 interval (the
interval characterized by the highest total reproductive stress,
given the age of the women), those with more pregnancies and
longer periods of lactation had lower weight gains. In later
periods, women who were lactating at the end of the interval
when weight was measured had lower weight gains, but once
current lactation status was taken into account, there were no
additional effects of pregnancies or lactation during the inter-
val. Ideally, we would like to have more precisely quantified
lactation stress by separating the effects of full vs. partial
breast-feeding, but this was not possible with the available
data. Prior work on this sample has shown that prolonged
lactation in the absence of adequate dietary intake contributes
to depletion of maternal energy reserves, especially in poor

rural women (14). Thus, at one end of the spectrum, in the
poorest, oldest, and highest fertility segment of the population,
high reproductive demands continue to result in lower weight
gain. With modernization, improved economic status, and
higher education levels, birth spacing increases, and total fer-
tility and lactation duration are reduced. For example, among
sample women who one might assume have completed child-
bearing (e.g., those 45 years of age or older in 1999), mean
number of pregnancies is lower in the 45- to 50-year-old group
than in those who are 50 years or older. Reduced reproductive
stress is associated with higher weight gains and overweight. In
Brazil, Coitinho et al. (15) have found only small effects of
parity and lactation on long-term weight gain of Brazilian
women, with effects being stronger in women who were ini-
tially obese.
Changes in Economic Status and Employment
At the baseline survey, there were no significant differ-
ences in SES by age category. However, by 1999, women
who were 25 to 35 at baseline had larger improvements in
SES compared with both older and younger age groups.
These economic gains are also consistent with this age
group having the highest mean level of education. Improve-
ments in household income and acquisition of assets have
broad effects on diet and activity patterns. For example, as
women get older, they acquire skills and material resources
that allow them to establish their own small businesses.
About one in seven women in the sample had their own
small "sari-sari" stores or eateries. Work in these small
neighborhood convenience stores is sedentary much of the
time, and access to snack foods is high. Furthermore, our
more detailed analysis of the 1994 to 1999 time period
revealed that increased away-from-home work hours were
associated with higher weight gains. The time trend in the
Philippines, as in other developing countries, is toward
more sedentary work. Earnings tend to increase with more
work hours, and higher income is associated with changes in
diet. As expected, increasing energy intake contributes to
higher weight gain. Unfortunately, the time period of great-
est weight gain (1986 to 1991) was not the period during
which detailed time allocation data were collected, so we
cannot repeat this analysis in another time interval.
Effects on Health Status
The health consequences of increasing weight are well il-
lustrated by the strong association of obesity and, in particular,
abdominal obesity, with risk of hypertension. Results for Cebu
women are consistent with the trend observed across develop-
ing as well as developed countries, where increasing adiposity
is strongly associated with BP (16). These results and national
evidence of a rapidly worsening chronic disease profile in the
Philippines call for a new emphasis on obesity and chronic
disease prevention. In particular, public health programs
should include risk assessment based on anthropometry and
more extensive BP screening. Obesity prevention is particu-
larly challenging in a developing country context where prob-
lems of nutritional inadequacies remain, creating a dual burden
of over- and undernutrition.
