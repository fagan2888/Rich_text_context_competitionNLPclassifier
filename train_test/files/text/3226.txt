Abstract:
Heterogenous banking supervision and regulation is often considered as the most impor-
tant impediment for Pan-European Bank mergers. In this paper we identify other more
fundamental reasons for a limited degree of cross-country integration in retail banking.
We argue that the distribution of regional liquidity shocks may pose a natural limit to the
extent of cross-border bank mergers. The paper derives the impact of different underlying
stochastic structures on the optimal structure of cross regional bank mergers. Imposing
a symmetry restriction on the underlying stochastic structure of liquidity shocks we find
that benefits from diversification and the costs of contagion may be optimally traded off
if banks from some but not from all regions merge. Under an additional monotonicity
assumption full integration is only desirable if the number of regions with diverse risks is
sufficiently large.

Non technical summary
The lack of pan-European banks seem to be a major obstacle to an integration of the
retail bank market in Europe. The main impediment to cross-country bank mergers is
typically seen in the heterogeneity of banking regulation and supervision in the European
Union that prevails despite the existing minimum harmonization.1 This paper, however,
shows that more fundamental economic reasons might also prevent the formation of pan-
European banks.
The paper develops a model with different regions in which banks offer households de-
posit contracts that provide them with an insurance against idiosyncratic liquidity shocks.
Since the fraction of households facing a liquidity shock in each region is uncertain banks
cannot fully diversify liquidity risks within a region. But banks can decide to operate in
several regions in order to diversify regional liquidity risk. However, integrating several
regions in one multiregional bank brings about the risk of contagion within the bank: a
regional liquidity shortage in one region might exceed the excess liquidity generated in the
remaining regions creating a liquidity shortage in the multiregional bank. Given that the
number of regions is limited, regional risks are not fully diversifiable and the impact of a
regional liquidity shock on the liquidity stance of a multinational bank does not become
negligible. Thus banks face a tradeoff when deciding about a cross-border penetration of
the retail market.
The paper shows that under fairly general assumptions banks choose to expand their
business to several but not all regions. Obviously, any system of cross regional financial
integration within a multinational bank can be supported by certain assumptions regard-
ing the correlation of regional liquidity shocks. However, this paper considers symmetric
regions. This excludes positive or negative correlations of shocks across regions. But even
in this case it is not necessarily optimal to have either a fully integrated or a nationally
fragmented banking system.
To understand the intuition consider an economy with four regions and assume that
if a liquidity shortage occurs in one region all other regions have an abnormal liquidity
stance, i.e. have either a positive or a negative regional liquidity shock of the same size.
In this case it is always preferable for a bank to operate in at least two regions, because if
one region faces a liquidity shortage the second region could have an offsetting liquidity
shock. If the second region is also hit by a negative liquidity shock the two regions are not
worse off than if they were served by separate banks. Contagion does not occur in this case

of, Fulghieri, Gual, Mayer, and Vives (2005) argue in their report on the integration of
European banking along these lines.
with a two regional merger. Adding additional regions, however, brings about the risk of
financial contagion. Whenever the two initial regions have offsetting liquidity shocks, a
liquidity shortage in the additional regions would cause a failure of the multiregional bank.
At the same time it is rather unlikely that the additional regions have sufficient excess
liquidity to compensate a liquidity shortage in both initial regions. Thus it is optimal for
banks to operate in only two of the four regions.

Die geringe Anzahl an pan-europ¨

ing zu behindern. Dabei wird h¨
aufig die heterogene Bankenregulierung und -aufsicht
innerhalb Europas, die trotz der bestehenden Mindestharmonisierung zu verzeichnen ist,
als wesentliches Hindernis f¨

liegende Papier zeigt dagegen, dass auch fundamentale ¨

onnten.
Das pr¨
asentierte Modell basiert auf einer ¨
Okonomie mit mehreren Regionen, in de-
nen Banken privaten Haushalten Einlagenvertr¨
age als Versicherung gegen idiosynkratische
Liquidit¨
atsrisiken anbieten. Da allerdings der Anteil derjenigen Haushalte, die tats¨
achlich
einen Liquidit¨

onnen Liquidit¨
atsschocks innerhalb einer
Region nicht vollkommen diversifiziert werden. Um eine effizientere Diversifikation zu er-
reichen, k¨

ubergreifend operieren. Die Integration mehrerer
Regionen durch eine multiregionale Bank birgt allerdings auch das Risiko von Regionen
¨
ubergreifenden Ansteckungseffekten: Kann der Liquidit¨
atsengpass einer Region innerhalb
einer multiregionalen Bank nicht durch einen hinreichenden Liquidit¨
ats¨
uberhang einer an-
deren Region kompensiert werden, so f¨
uhrt dies in der gesamten multiregionalen Bank zu
einer Liquidit¨
atskrise. Ist die Zahl der Regionen begrenzt, sind Liquidit¨
atsrisiken auch
Regionen ¨
ubergreifend nicht vollst¨
andig diversifizierbar und der Einfluss eines regionalen
Liquidit¨
atsschocks auf den Liquidit¨
atsstatus einer multiregionalen Bank wird nicht ver-
schwindend. Dementsprechend muss eine Bank bei der Entscheidung, ¨

ubergreifender Ansteckungseffekte abw¨
agen.
Das vorliegende Papier zeigt, dass es f¨
ur Banken unter relativ allgemeinen Bedingun-

urlich l¨
asst sich
ein solches Ergebnis alleine durch eine bestimmte Korrelationsstruktur regionaler Schocks
erzielen. Das vorliegende Papier geht aber von vollkommen symmetrischen Regionen aus.
Es werden dementsprechend positive und negative Korrelationen zwischen Regionen aus-
geschlossen. Aber auch in diesem Fall zeigt sich, dass weder ein vollst¨

sind.
Um die Intuition nachzuvollziehen, sei eine ¨
Okonomie mit vier Regionen angenommen.
Dar¨
uber hinaus wird unterstellt, dass sofern eine Region einen Liquidit¨

auch s¨

2Barros, et al. (2005) argumentieren beispielsweise dementsprechend.
dass sie jeweils einen positiven oder einen negativen regionalen Liquidit¨

ur eine Bank, mindestens
in zwei Regionen pr¨

atsschock einer Region
wird dann unter Umst¨
anden von einem positiven Schock in der anderen Region begleitet
und kann hierdurch kompensiert werden. Ist die zweite Region dagegen auch von einem
Liquidit¨
atsengpass betroffen, so sind die beiden Regionen durch die Integration nicht
schlechter gestellt als im Falle einer Autonomie. Ein Ansteckungseffekt tritt bei einem
Bankenzusammenschluss ¨
uber zwei Regionen nicht auf. Dies ist anders, wenn die Bank ihr

urde
ein Liquidit¨

uhrt die Integration mit weiteren Regionen
nur in dem unwahrscheinlichen Fall zu einer Stabilisierung, in dem die beiden zus¨

Limits to International Banking
Consolidation
1 Introduction
The integration of the European banking sector has so far mainly been limited to the
wholesale market. The lack of pan-European banks however is the major obstacle to an
integration of the retail bank market. It is often argued that large cross-country mergers of
banks have mainly been impeded by the heterogenous banking regulation and supervision
in the European union.1
This paper questions whether indeed the heterogeneity in the regulatory and supervi-
sory regimes in Europe is the only reason why cross-country bank mergers in the European
Union have been limited and have failed to create a truly pan-European bank. A banking
system that relies on international institutions provides an insurance mechanism against
national liquidity shocks. However, cross border transactions and mergers can bring about
a risk of financial contagion, i.e. they may increase systemic risk. A liquidity shortage in
a single region can spill-over to other regions if large financial institutions are fully liable
for their foreign branches.
We develop a model of banks as managers of different liquidity risks related to Kashyap,
Rajan, and Stein (2002). However, unlike Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002) we follow
Allen and Gale (2000) and assume regional liquidity shocks as the primary source of
banks' liquidity risk. Banks can choose to operate in different regions.
Banks offer regional households with uncertain intertemporal consumption preferences
a liquidity insurance through deposit contracts as in Diamond and Dybvig (1983). How-
ever, in each region there is some risk associated with the fraction of depositors having
early consumption needs. A bank that operates in more than one region can insure de-
positors against regional liquidity risks. However, it risks that liquidity shortages in other
regions spill over and adversely affect its entire business. Using this framework we show
that a partial integration of the retail banking sector with banks operating in several but
not all regions may actually be optimal given a certain fundamental stochastic structure
of regional specific liquidity shocks.
We would like to thank Frank Heid, Michael Koetter, and Rowena Pecchenino as well as the conference
participants of the 4th INFINITY Conference Dublin for helpful comments. The views expressed here
are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Deutsche Bundesbank.

European banking along these lines.

Obviously, any system of cross regional financial integration can be supported by some
underlying stochastic structure of liquidity needs. In order to gain further insights one
needs to distinguish more and less realistic scenarios. In our paper we impose a symmetry
assumption which excludes positive or negative correlations of shocks across regions. We
show that even if all regions are entirely symmetric and no particular correlation between
the liquidity shocks of specific regions is assumed, its is not necessarily optimal to have
either a full integrated or a nationally fragmented banking system. On the contrary, we
find that in many cases a multinational bank that optimally trades off the diversification
benefits and the costs from negative cross-regional spillovers is only operating in several
but not all countries. In other words we show that the problem of finding the optimal
size of multinational banks often has an interior solution in which banks operate only in
a subset of the countries of an economic area.
Of course, our results only hold if the number of regions with different risk structures
is not abundant. If this was the case then - by the law of large numbers - a complete
merger of banks in all existing regions would help to diversify away all risks. Moreover,
financial distress in single regions would not cause the breakdown of the entire system
because the excess liquidity need in one region would be relatively low. However, if the
number of regions is limited, the financial distress in one region may cause a breakdown
of a bank that operates in the entire economy. This is what we shall assume in this paper.
Similar to banks in Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002) deposit institutes in our frame-
work try to economize on their overall liquidity risk by combining negatively correlated
liquidity risks across regions. Consequently, if it is very likely that two regions are hit
by (offsetting) liquidity shocks a two-regional bank merger (or a bank operating in two
regions, respectively) can reduce the overall liquidity risk of the financial institution. If
it is on the other hand rather likely that a liquidity shock only occurs in one region at
the same time, then the risk that such a regional shock might induce a collapse of the
multinational banks is too high. Multinational banks are inefficient in this case­banks
should operate only in one region. Financial risk that is concentrated on single regions
makes it desirable to partition the economy completely.
In our paper we introduce the notion of financial turbulence. Financial turbulence is
characterized by situations in which all regions simultaneously display unusually high or
unusually low liquidity needs: A liquidity shortage in one region is always accompanied by
an abnormal (positive or negative) liquidity stance of the same size in all other regions.
We show that a high relative likelihood of financial turbulence makes limited financial
integration particularly desirable.
To understand the intuition consider an economy with four regions. In this case it
2
is always preferable for a bank to operate in at least two regions, because if one region
faces a liquidity shortage the second region could have an offsetting liquidity shock. If
the second region is also hit by a negative liquidity shock the two regions are not worst
off than if they were served by separate banks. Contagion does not occur in this case
with a two regional merger. Adding additional regions, however, brings about the risk
of financial contagion. Whenever, the two initial regions have offsetting liquidity shocks
a liquidity shortage in the additional regions would cause a failure of the multiregional
bank. At the same time it is rather unlikely that the additional regions have sufficient
excess liquidity to compensate a liquidity shortage in both initial regions. Moreover, in
cases with excess liquidity in the two considered regions a merger with other regions leads
very likely to a liquidity transfer to other regions with less liquidity. Thus given a high
relative likelihood of financial turbulence it is optimal for banks to operate in only two of
the four regions.
While our model shares the common feature of banks as managers of liquidity risks
with Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002), our model differs from theirs in several respects.
Most important is probably that in Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002) banks' main ob-
jective when combining liquidity risks is to minimize costly cash holdings. In contrast,
in our model banks try to smooth consumption for their stake holders taking negatively
correlated liquidity risks. In this respect our paper is also closely related to models that
analyze the costs and benefits of integrated interbank bank markets like Allen and Gale
(2000) and Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet (2000). They show that an integrated interbank
market may serve as a means for banks to mutually insure against negatively correlated
bank specific liquidity shocks. But when deciding to integrate through the interbank
market banks do not take into account the risk of financial contagion. For a two regional
economy Fecht and Gr¨
uner (2004) analyze the decision of banks to integrate through
the interbank market trading off the benefits from diversifying idiosyncratic liquidity
shocks against the costs from contagion in case of aggregate liquidity shortages. Fecht
and Gr¨
uner (2004) also show that interbank integration does not capture all benefit from
financial integration even if regional specific liquidity shocks are the only benefit from
integration. A cross-regionally active bank could provide even smoother consumption
possibilities than regional banks being insured over the interbank market. This paper
extends the framework of Fecht and Gr¨
uner (2004) to multiple regions but focuses only
on financial integration through cross-country bank merger. Intriguingly, we find that
even though cross-country mergers allow to reap the maximum benefits from cross-border
integration (as compared to interbank market integration) depending on the distribution
of the regional liquidity shocks it is still not necessarily optimal for banks to operate in
3
all regions of an economy.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic
settings of the model. In section 2.4 we derive the optimal deposit contract that banks
offer to households. If states with liquidity shocks are sufficiently unlikely this deposit
contract is independent of the degree of international integration chosen by banks. Thus
we can take the optimal deposit contract as given, when deriving the optimal degree
of cross-country integration of the banking sector in section 3 for different parameter
settings. Section 4 provides some simulation results and section 5 concludes.
2 The Model
2.1 Households
The economy consists of four regions I = 1, .., 4. Each region consists of a mass 1 of
households with the same stochastic utility function
Ui
(c1
; c2
) = ~
j
u (c1
) + 1 - ~
j
u (c2
) ,
with
u (ct
) =
1
1 - 
c1-
t
and  > 1 and ~
j
 {0; 1}
In each region I households do not know whether they can derive utility from con-
sumption in t = 1 or t = 2. They only know that with a probability ~
qI
they will turn out
to be impatient and want to consume in t = 1. The probability ~
qI
of becoming an impa-
tient household (which is at the same time the regional fraction of impatient households)
is itself stochastic:
~
j
dj = ~
qI
with ~
qI
 0;
1
2
; 1 .
With probability a the fraction of impatient consumers in all four regions equals 1/2.
With probability (1 - a) in at least one of the regions qI
= 1
2
. This means that in one or
more regions either a high (1) or a low (0) fraction of households wants to consume early.
2.2 Stochastic structure
In an economy with four regions and two types of liquidity shocks there are 34 = 81
possible realizations of the shocks. The set of possible probability distributions is given
by the unit simplex with 81 dimensions. In order to impose some further structure on
the problem we assume that each situation with a given number of shocks is equally
4
likely. This implies that shocks are not correlated across regions. Call the conditional
probabilities of each event with i shocks i
, i = 1, 2, ..4. I.e. 1
is the conditional (on the
fact that there is a liquidity shock somewhere) probability that there is an early (or late)
liquidity shock in one particular region and no shock in the other three regions. In this
analysis we restrict our attention to the limit case with a  0. We have:
81
+ 242
+ 323
+ 164
= 1,
i.e. there are 8 possible constellations with one single shock, 24 possible constellations
with 2 shocks and so on. Four prototype situations will be distinguished:
1. financial risk 1
= 1/8 (2
= 3
= 4
= 0).
2. limited turbulence 2
= 1/24 (1
= 3
= 4
= 0).
3. significant turbulence 3
= 1/32 (1
= 2
= 4
= 0).
4. turbulence 4
= 1/16 (1
= 2
= 3
= 0).
Any other stochastic structure is a convex combination of these 4 regimes.
Our second, stronger assumption is that liquidity shocks which affect a smaller number
of regions are more likely. Under such a monotonous risk structure 81
> 242
> 323
>
164
. This assumption will only be needed for one particular result on the desirability of
full financial integration.
2.3 Technology
There is one direct investment technology available in the economy. In t = 0 households
can invest in the technology. Because it is not observable whether a particular household
is patient or impatient, there is no direct insurance mechanism against liquidity risks
available. Furthermore, there is no financial market in t = 1 available in which households
from the four regions could participate.
t = 0 t = 1 t = 2
finished -1 0 R > 1
liquidated -1 +1 0
We assume that the long-term returns are sufficiently large and/or that the degree of
households' risk aversion is sufficiently high that
3
2
> R(1-)/.
5
As we shall see below this assumption ensures that a bank operating in all four regions
and offering the optimal deposit contract will collapse even if only in one of the four
regions an early liquidity shock occurs.
Besides direct investment households can invest their endowment at a bank. Banks
offer deposit contracts with alternative repayments in both periods, {d1
; d2
}. There is
one bank in each region. However, banking markets are contestable. Therefore banks are
forced to offer the deposit contract that maximizes the expected utility of depositors.
If banks cannot repay all depositors withdrawing in t = 1 all depositors (even those
initially not withdrawing in t = 1) receive the same pro-rata repayment. Thus we abstract
for sequential service constraints and thereby exclude purely expectation driven bank runs.
2.4 The optimal deposit contract
Given our assumption that liquidity shocks are sufficiently unlikely (a  0) the optimal
deposit contract maximizes households expected utility

; d2

3 The optimal degree of financial integration
3.1 Useful results
It is useful to note that there are cases in which only the likelihood of a bank's bankruptcy
determines the ranking of consumer utility. This holds if the risk aversion parameter  is
sufficiently large.
Proposition 1 Consider two banks 1, 2 that go bankrupt with some probability a1
, a2
,
provide customers with normal payoffs dM
1
, dM
2
with probability b1
, b2
, and provide the
6
normal payoff dM
1
at date 1 and R at date 2 with probability c1
, c2
. For all R <  and
0  b1,2
, c1,2
< 1 there is a  such that for all    bank 1 is preferable to bank 2 if it
only has a low default probability, i.e. if a1
< a2
.
Proof. An individual who is extremely risk averse maximizes his minimum payoff.
The optimal contract fixes identical payoffs in both periods.

dM
1
= lim

dM
2
=
2
R-1 + 1
.
Moreover, for  going to infinity utility is larger if and only if the probability of the
lowest payoff, 1 is minimized. To see this verify that the utility of bank 1's customers
may be written:
a1

1 - 
11- +
j=1..4

, R > 1 and xj

.
Thus for sufficiently risk averse households banks' prior aim is to minimize the proba-
bility of a default due to a liquidity shortage. Achieving or efficiently distributing excess
liquidity becomes subordinated.
Our second result relates to situations of low risk aversion. In such cases there is
almost no consumption smoothing since c1
 1 and c2
 R. The loss from a financial
crises in a single region is negligible because all consumers would optimally consume one
unit anyway. However, in other regimes there may be contagion in cases in which some
consumers prefer to consume at the later date. Therefore , for low values of  separation
is strictly preferred to any other regime.
Proposition 2 For all R there is a ¯
 > 1 such that for all   ¯
 separation is strictly
preferred to any other regime.
Proof. For a risk-neutral individual the optimal contract fixes dM
1
= 1, dM
2
= R. To
see this, consider the ratio of the maximum date 2 payoff R and normal date 2 payments,
7

Hence, under separation, early consumers realize their desired consumption even in the
event of a crises. Late consumers realize the maximum payoff R, i.e. there is no potential
gain from late liquidity sharing. All other forms of integration yield lower payoffs because
there is a risk of liquidation for late consumers due to financial contagion. The rest follows
from the continuity of utilities in .
We now use the first result to derive the optimal structure of the banking sector in
cases with highly risk averse depositors.
3.2 Separation
Financial integration is particularly costly if shocks are limited to single regions (1
= 1
8
).
In such a situation a financial merger has two effects: (i) a positive liquidity sharing effect
in case of a positive liquidity shock in one region and (ii) a contagion effect which is
particularly likely. This is due to the fact that in half of all cases the aggregate liquidity
shortage leads to a collapse of a cross-regionally active bank.2 Liquidity shocks can never
offset each other in this case.
Proposition 3 (i) Consider an economy with only financial risk (81
= 1). For all R
there is a  such that for all    separation strictly maximizes expected household
utility. Utility strictly decreases in the order of integration. (ii) Consider an economy
under limited financial turbulence. For all R there is a  such that for all    separation
and full integration maximizes expected household utility. Intermediate integration yields
inferior results.
2Keep in mind that we assume that each region is large enough to induce a financial collapse of the
entire system.

Proof. (i) Table 1 relates to a situation with regionally concentrated financial risk.

. Each row represents one situation in which one particular region is
affected by a shock. A black square ( ) represents excessive liquidity (qI
= 0), an empty
square ( ) too little liquidity (qI
= 1). A zero represents normal liquidity. Separation
yields maximum utility. 2-integration introduces a loss due to contagion in case 6. 3-
integration introduces a loss due to contagion in cases 6 and 7, and so on.
(ii) Table 2 relates to a situation with limited financial turbulence, i.e. two regions are
affected by a shock. Consider the risk of bankruptcy for consumers in region 1 in a merger
with region 2. Bankruptcy occurs in 9 cases (4,6,11,14,16,18,20,23,24). Under separation
bankruptcy occurs in 6 cases. Under 3 integration in 9 and under full integration in 6
cases.
3.3 Existence of an interior solution
A limited merger of only two banks may be the optimal solution when an abnormal liquid-
ity demand in all regions is the most likely type of shock. In our model this corresponds
to the case where 16 · 4
= 1. We refer to such situations as cases with likely financial
turbulence.
Proposition 4 Consider an economy with likely financial turbulence (164
= 1). For all
R > 1 there is a lower bound  such that for all    2-integration strictly maximizes
expected household utility.
Proof. Table 3 relates to a situation with financial turbulence: there is a shock in
every region. Consider the risk of bankruptcy for consumers in region 1 in a merger with
9

region 2. Bankruptcy occurs in 4 cases (13-16). Under separation bankruptcy occurs in
8 cases, under 3-integration in 8 cases, under 4 integration in 5 cases.

The possible welfare gain from 2-integration (versus separation) arises when there are
opposite liquidity shocks in those two regions. A possible cost arises when region 1 is
characterized by a high liquidity need and region 2 has a normal liquidity status. In this
case liquidity is transferred from region 1 to region 2. However, as seen in section 3.1. for
sufficiently risk averse households these costs are always overcompensated by the benefit
from the reduced default risk.
10
Adding two more regions (i.e. a complete merger of all four regional banks) raises
the cost of financial contagion significantly but adds little to the positive insurance effect.
If financial turbulence is the most likely outcome (meaning that all four regions have
different liquidity needs than usual) then adding two more regions can only help in those
cases where the two initial regions have been subject to the same - early - liquidity
shock. If the two regions have an excess liquidity they would be forced to share this
excess liquidity with the two additional regions if they have less liquidity. But more
importantly, given that the two initial regions have offsetting liquidity shocks expanding
the bank to two additional regions increases the risk that a liquidity shortage from the
other regions causes a default of the entire bank.
A similar result is obtained for a case of significant financial turbulence.
Proposition 5 Consider an economy under significant financial turbulence (323
= 1).
For all R > 1 there is a lower bound  such that for all    3-integration strictly
maximizes expected household utility.
Proof. Table 4 relates to a situation with significant financial turbulence: there is
always a shock in 3 of the 4 regions. Consider the risk of bankruptcy for consumers
in region 1 in a merger with region 2 and 3. Bankruptcy occurs in 10 cases (cases:
1,3,5,7,13,16,21,22,29, and 32). Under separation bankruptcy occurs in 12 cases, under
2-integration in 12 cases, under 4 integration in 16 cases.
3.4 Full integration
Proposition 6 (i) Full integration can only be uniquely optimal under a risk struc-
ture which is a convex combination of limited turbulence and turbulence. (ii) Under a
monotonous risk structure full integration can never be optimal.
Proof. (i) Under financial risk and significant turbulence full integration is the worst
of all options. It is optimal under limited turbulence and preferred to separation under
turbulence. From what we have learned so far under full separation the conditional
probability a liquidity shortage at the bank is:
1
= 1
+ 62
+ 123
+ 84
.
Under 2-integration it is:
2
= 21
+ 92
+ 123
+ 44
.
Under 3-integration it is:
3
= 31
+ 92
+ 103
+ 84
.

For  1 full integration is uniquely optimal.
(ii) Under a monotonous risk structure 81
> 242
> 323
> 164
. One can easily
verify that this is incompatible with full integration dominating separation.
It is important to note that complete integration is particularly bad in those situations
in which regions one and two are hit by a positive shock (see table 3). In most situations
it is not good to integrate them because they would have to share their excess liquidity
with the two other regions (cases 10-12). If by contrast regions one and two are both hit
by a negative shock then integration usually does not help (cases 14-16). It only helps
in the case where the two remaining regions are affected by a positive shock (case 13).
If the shock in regions one and two offset one another then integration does not help if
liquidity is balanced in the rest of the economy and it is bad if there is a need for liquidity
in the rest of the economy (case 1 and 5). Only if there is excess liquidity in the rest of
the economy integration has a benefit (case 2).
Consequently, when financial risk is dominant, separation is a good option. When
financial turbulence is likely, less than complete integration may be a good choice. Under
a monotonous risk structure full integration is not desirable for risk averse consumers.
4 Simulation results
We complete the paper with a simulation analysis for those intermediate parameter values
for which no clear welfare analysis can be provided. We have to start by specifying
households' expected utility in the different arrangements. Under separation, households
expected utility conditional on the occurrence of a shock in some region of the economy
can be calculated as:

The first line corresponds to normal liquidity, the second to a financial crises and the
third to excess liquidity. Under 2-integration excess liquidity may be shared with the
other region in a number of cases (third line). We have:

5 Conclusion
This paper has analyzed the welfare effects of financial integration. According to our
analysis international bank integration may yield welfare losses for risk neutral and for
strongly risk averse depositors when too many banks merge. The reason is that contagion
is particulary likely under a fully integrated banking system - almost independently of
whether financial turbulences are limited to a subset of regions or not.
Any welfare analysis of this kind needs to impose some restrictions on the underlying
stochastic structure. Otherwise, trivially, any structure of the banking sector can be
optimal under appropriate assumptions about the correlation of shocks. We have imposed
two major restrictions on the underlying stochastic structures in order to organize our
16
analysis efficiently: (i) the uncorrelatedness of shocks across regions and in one case (ii)
the decreasing order on the likelihood of multiple shocks. In this concluding section we
would like to briefly discuss two alternative scenarios.
A positive correlation of shocks across regions is a scenario that may result when
aggregate demand is correlated e.g. due to trade liberalization. In such cases very little
can be said in favor of any sort of financial integration because the scope for diversification
is reduced. What would speak in favor of full integration are scenarios with a strong
negative correlation which actually is not too intuitive. Due to a low degree of real
and political integration in the European union individual shocks to specific countries
are still most likely. More widespread shocks ­ in particular, counterbalancing shocks in
several countries that could result from significant cross-border portfolio shifts ­ are still
comparably unlikely. Accordingly limits to cross border activities or financial mergers
may naturally arise.
One should however keep in mind that the present analysis relies on the assumption
that a complete diversification is excluded. Large scale financial integration is always
desirable when risk can be fully diversified away through appropriate arrangements such
as mergers or cross border activity of financial institutions. However, when the number of
regions is not large enough, partial financial integration may be the optimal choice from
depositors' point of view. This may explain why financial integration across European
regions is still limited.
The present paper is also skeptical about gradualism in financial integration. Even if a
large financial institution that diversifies away all risks is feasible in practice, the present
analysis points out that a cost has to be borne along the way to such a conglomerate if
the merger process evolves gradually.
