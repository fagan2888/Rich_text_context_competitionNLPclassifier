Transfer pricing as tax avoidance under different legislative schemes

Abstract
This paper investigates transfer pricing as tax avoidance before and after reforms of anti-
avoidance legislation. The reforms introduced and tightened obligatory documentation require-
ments for transfer prices to enforce that multinational enterprises (MNEs) set internal transfer
prices at an arm's-length. Linking data from the Microdatabase Statistics on International
Trade in Services that comprehends prices of MNEs' international service transactions to the
Microdatabase Direct Investment, I create a unique, novel data set to obtain information on
whether MNEs' transaction partners are affiliated companies or not. The results provide em-
pirical evidence for tax-motivated transfer pricing during the entire first decade of the 2000s.
Interestingly, MNEs target different types of service transactions for profit shifting via trans-
fer pricing depending on the at the time applicable anti-shifting legislation. The findings show
transfer pricing legislation to be effective in case of service transactions with observable market
values. In contrast, the results clearly reveal the short-comings of transfer pricing legislation in
case of intellectual property (IP) where an effective enforcement of the arm's-length principle
is very limited as market values are unobservable. Here, the findings suggest the need for a
change in tax policy in order to effectively prevent base erosion in case of IP-related transfer
pricing.

1 Introduction
Multinational firms' business activities have been an important part of the development towards
today's integrated global economy. In 2014, the United Nations Conference on Trade and De-
velopment (UNCTAD) estimated the total outward stock of foreign direct investment (valued
at current prices) to be $ 25,875 billion, as compared to the total outward stock of FDI in
1990, which amounted to $ 2,254 billion, representing an increase by a factor of more than ten
(UNCTAD, 2015). Multinational firms are big. It is not an isolated case that their revenues are
of the magnitude of medium-sized economies' annual GDP.1 Further, multinational firms are
very profitable. Profit margins in the two-digit range are rather the norm as the exemption.2
From a fiscal perspective, their size and profitability make multinational firms promising tax
payers. But multinational firms have proven to be very hard to tax. Their firm structures are
stretching across the globe, typically, incorporating a multitude of entities located in different
countries worldwide. And precisely this internationality allows them to avoid taxation in high
tax countries.
There is remarkable anecdotal evidence of extreme cases of international tax avoidance of
multinational enterprises (MNEs). Due to an elaborated international tax strategy, Apple Inc.,
for instance, paid (at least) between 2009 and 2011 an effective corporate tax rate below 1% on
its pre-tax earnings generated from foreign non-US sales of Apple products.3
Empirical evidence that substantiates anecdotes on international tax avoidance of MNEs is
compelling. Numerous studies show a sensitivity of MNEs' pre-tax profits to corporate taxation
1 For an example, consider the world's largest technology companies (measured by total revenue), the US com-
pany Apple Inc. and the Korean company Samsung Electronics. Apple's 2015 revenue amounted to 233.7
billion US-dollars, Samsung's generated a revenue of 167.9 billion US-dollars. Ireland, a developed European
economy and OECD member, showed in 2014 a GDP of 241 billion US-dollars.
2 In 2015, for instance, 21 of the 30 multinational firms that are listed in the US stock exchange index Dow Jones
Industrial reported profit margins in the two-digit range.

Inc.) (2013, p.21).

which is both statistically and economically significant (see e.g. Huizinga and Laeven, 2008;
Dharmapala and Riedel, 2013). While the existence of profit shifting is an empirically well
established fact, the exploration of the methods used by MNEs to manipulate the allocation
of taxable profits is still continuing. The literature discusses two main methods that MNEs
use to shift profits from high to low tax jurisdictions: intra-firm debt and the manipulation of
transfer prices. The use of intra-firm debt to avoid taxation has been analyzed both theoretically
and empirically, amongst others, by Desai et al. (2004); Huizinga and Laeven (2008); Gordon
(2010); Buettner and Wamser (2013). Further, a large body of literature has established theories
on MNEs' tax-motivated transfer pricing (see e.g. Kant, 1988; Haufler and Schjelderup, 2000;
Grubert, 2003; Becker and Davies, 2014; Nielsen et al., 2014). While the theoretical literature
on tax avoidance through transfer pricing is well developed, direct empirical evidence for tax-
motivated transfer pricing is rather sparse. In the past, data limitations4 have been an insuperable
obstacle for profound empirical analyses of tax implications for transfer pricing.
Despite sparse empirical evidence, transfer pricing has become a top item on the fiscal policy
agenda during the last fifteen years. The fact that four out of 15 Actions on the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Action Plan against "Base Erosion
and Profit Shifting" (BEPS) are concerned with different aspects of transfer pricing clearly
illustrates the political importance of the topic.5 In order to prevent profit shifting via transfer
pricing and protect national tax bases, the last decade saw many countries implementing transfer
pricing legislation (Lohse and Riedel, 2013). Core of these legislative schemes is the arm's-
length principle for transfer pricing. The OECD has been actively promoting the arm's-length
principle for years to ensure that MNEs set intra-firm transfer prices at a market value basis
4 Standard firm-micro data sets neither provide MNEs' prices of products and transaction modes nor reveal
whether transactions are at arm's-length or intra-firm.
5 Precisely, these are actions 8, 9, 10 and 13 that are concerned with assuring that transfer pricing outcomes are
in line with value creation and with transfer pricing documentation (OECD, 2013).

(without tax intension).6 Typically, these legislations oblige MNEs to compile comprehensive
documentation of their transfer price setting. Using this documentation, tax authorities are to be
enabled to check whether transfer prices are set at arm's-length and, thus, comply with the tax
law. Although transfer pricing legislation reportedly leads to high administrative burden both
for firms and tax administrations and, therefore, could potentially create large inefficiencies, we
though know little about transfer price setting of MNEs under these legislative schemes.
This paper studies the case of German MNEs' transfer pricing during the first decade of the
2000s, a period of time that covers different changes in German legislative schemes against tax-
motivated transfer pricing. The analysis investigates patterns in the tax sensitivity of MNEs'
internal transfer prices before and after reforms of anti-shifting legislation. German MNEs
are a perfect testing ground for the reason of availability of exceptional high-quality data that
provides all the information needed to empirically study tax-motivated transfer pricing. The
data set consists of a link of the Microdatabase Statistics on International Trade in Services
with the Microdatabase Direct Investment. This newly generated dataset comprehends both
prices of MNEs' international service transactions and, as an unique feature, information on
whether MNEs' transaction partners are affiliated companies or not. A further advantageous
feature is the long time period covered. The generated dataset comprehends monthly cross-
sectional data on MNEs' international service transactions for almost an entire decade (2001-
2010). Compared to the datasets used in previous studies, this is a clear advantage as MNEs'
response in tax-motivated transfer pricing to changing anti-shifting legislation can be traced
over time.
The results provide empirical evidence for tax-motivated transfer pricing during the entire
decade. Interestingly, MNEs target different types of service transactions for profit shifting
via transfer pricing depending on the then applicable anti-shifting legislation. The findings

show transfer pricing rules to be effective in cases where it can be reasonably assumed that
tax authorities can verify the compliance of transfer prices with the arm's-length principle as
arm's-length prices are observable. Despite policy efforts on comprehensive transfer pricing
legislation, transfer pricing that involves intellectual property (IP) becomes a source for base
erosion in the second half of the decade due to unobservable arm's-length prices in case of IP.
The fact that profit shifting via IP-related transfer pricing occurs after an European Court of
Justice's ruling in 2006 that restricted the application of controlled foreign corporation (CFC)
rules within the EU clearly indicates that before 2006 not transfer pricing legislation but the
more general CFC legislation effectively had prevented profit shifting via IP-related transfer
pricing. In general, the empirical results reveal the short-comings of transfer pricing legislation
in cases where an effective enforcement of the arm's-length principle is limited as arm's-length
prices are unobservable.
This paper relates to two strands of empirical literature. The first strand consists of pa-
pers that investigate the relevance of transfer pricing as a profit shifting channel for MNEs.
The second strand of literature analyzes the effect of transfer pricing legislation on MNEs'
tax-motivated transfer pricing. Empirical evidence on tax-motivated transfer pricing is in most
cases indirect. Studies typically analyze whether there is systematic correlation between tax
rates and profit rates (see for a survey Dharmapala, 2014). Most analyses find a statistically
significant association between taxation and firm's pre-tax profit rates, however, the strength of
the relationship varies across studies.7 One general drawback of these studies is that MNEs'
profit shifting cannot clearly be pinned down to tax-motivated transfer pricing which is just one
of various potential profit shifting channels. There are few empirical attempts to shed light on
the relevance of transfer pricing compared to other profit shifting channels, moreover, with op-
7 A meta-study by Heckemeyer and Overesch (2013) estimates a semi-elasticity of profits with respect to the
corporate tax rate of 0.8: an increase in the corporate tax rate of 10 percentage points decreases the reported
pre-tax profit by 8%.

posite conclusions. Dharmapala and Riedel (2013) find that profit shifting is mainly conducted
via debt shifting. In contrast, Grubert (2003) shows that income derived from research and de-
velopment (R&D) based intangibles accounts for about half of the income shifted from high-tax
to low-tax countries.
Previous to this paper, there are only a few studies that intent to estimate the direct effect
of taxation on MNEs' transfer pricing. In general, these studies' findings are in line with tax-
motivated transfer pricing at work. Empirical evidence is provided by Bartelsman and Beetsma
(2003) for the value added in different manufacturing sectors for a sample of OECD countries,
by Overesch (2006) for German MNEs' balance sheet positions which reflect intra-firm trans-
action values, by Swenson (2001) for US import prices, by Clausing (2003) and Bernard et al.
(2008) for intra-firm trade prices of US MNEs, and by Davies et al. (2014) for intra-firm export
prices for a sample of French firms.
Although transfer pricing legislation potentially imposes considerable enforcement and
compliance cost on tax administrations and firms, there is previous to this paper only one study
that analyzes the relationship between tax-motivated transfer pricing and transfer pricing legis-
lation. Lohse and Riedel (2013) employ in their study information on the scope and evolution
of a number of countries' transfer pricing laws. The analysis uses an indirect approach based
on profit rates to analyze MNEs response in tax-motivated transfer pricing to respective restric-
tions. Their results suggest that transfer pricing rules statistically and economically significantly
reduce profit shifting.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides the institutional background. Section
3 derives the hypotheses. Section 4 presents the data set. Section 5 describes the empirical
strategy. Section 6 analyzes tax-motivated transfer pricing and evaluates the effectiveness of
transfer pricing legislation. Section 7 concludes.

2 Institutional background
2.1 Incentives for profit shifting via transfer pricing
In a world of fiscal sovereignty and nationally organized taxation MNE activity creates the
necessity to split MNEs' profits between the jurisdictions that host MNEs' entities. One of the
issues that arises in this context is transfer pricing where the term transfer pricing describes
the pricing of MNE-internal cross-border transactions. In order to shift profits by means of
transfer pricing, MNEs relate transfer prices negatively to foreign corporate tax rates. Hence,
for one and the same good or service, high-tax entities would charge low transfer prices from
low-tax entities, in contrast to low-tax entities that would charge high transfer prices from high-
tax entities. In this way, tax base is shifted from high to low-tax jurisdictions and the MNE's
aggregated tax burden reduced.
To prevent tax-motivated transfer pricing and to ensure for governments an alignment of
rights to tax with real economic activity, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and De-
velopment (OECD) addressed transfer pricing in its 1995 published OECD Transfer Pricing
Guidelines (OECD, 2010). These guidelines established the so called arm's-length principle as
international consensus on transfer pricing. The arm's length principle is supposed to ensure
that transfer prices between entities of MNEs are established on a market value basis. Hence,
the principle means that (transfer) prices should be the same as they would have been, had the
parties to the transaction not been part of the same MNE. The idea is that the arm's-length
principle prevents profits being systematically shifted to low-tax countries.8
8 Whether the arm's-length principle effectively prevents profit shifting is controversial and has been questioned
in economic literature. Bauer and Langenmayr (2013) demonstrate that, in the presence of cost heterogeneity
across firms, profit shifting may occur even if the firm fully complies with the arm's-length principle. In
their model, firms have an incentive to engage in intra-firm trade if their cost is small (or high) relative to the
arm's-length price such that profit is effectively shifted to the low-tax jurisdiction.
6
To enforce the arm's-length principle effectively, it is internationally considered key to
oblige MNEs to comprehensively document their transfer pricing. First, comprehensive trans-
fer pricing documentation could facilitate tax audits as reference arm's-length prices are doc-
umented. Second, through the obligation to provide comprehensive documentation, MNEs'
compliance with the arm's-length principle could increase. As MNEs have to justify every
transfer price with an arm's-length price that is in line with tax law, the scope for profit shifting
via transfer pricing potentially narrows.
2.2 German legislative schemes against tax-motivated transfer pricing
2.2.1 Transfer pricing legislation
Although already referring to the arm's-length principle as reference for the international profit
split in case of transfer pricing since 1983, German tax law incorporated no legally binding
documentation requirements until 2003. In 2003, German legislator introduced obligatory doc-
umentation requirements for transfer prices into the tax law. It precisely determined content,
scope, and time of provision of transfer pricing documentation.9 Accordingly, MNEs had to
disclose any information that was necessary for tax administration to judge whether a transfer
price was set at arm's-length. In particular, MNEs had to disclose underlying (arm's-length)
reference prices and applied transfer pricing methods. Further, the documentation had to in-
clude information on the circumstances under which the underlying transaction was conducted.
This contains e.g. information on business terms and conditions, cost splits, markups, as well
as price-relevant competitive conditions on the market. The new documentation requirements
meant a major change for tax practice. In surveys from the early 2000s, the majority of German
firm responsibles consider transfer pricing as the most important international taxation issue
9 See GAufzV v. November 13, 2003 (BGBl. I 2003, 2296) for reference.

faced by their firms (Ernst and Young, 2003). Based on an in detail transfer pricing documen-
tation, tax authorities are to be enabled to check whether transfer prices comply with the tax
law. In the beginning, however, transposing the new transfer pricing legislation in tax audits
should have been challenging. For the purpose of clarification, the German Ministry of Finance
provided additional guidelines for tax audits to the tax administration in form of administrative
principles in April 2005.
In 2008, German legislator tightened transfer pricing legislation. The ranking of transfer
pricing methods, a precedence of standard methods compared to profit methods, became tax
law. Further, tax administrations were hence allowed to conduct penalty estimations of transfer
prices at the disfavor of the tax payer in case a transfer price is not in line with the arm's-
length principle. Before 2008, tax administrations used to adjust non-compliant transfer prices
to (from the tax payer's perspective) the most favorable arm's-length price. Consequently, up
from 2008 very aggressive transfer pricing strategies bare high tax risks for MNEs, as potential
adjustments by the tax administration are tendentiously larger (Bernhardt et al., 2008). Further,
German legislator shortened MNEs' time limits for documentation submission in case of tax
audits from 60 to 30 days for extraordinary business transactions. This considerably increased
the necessity for MNEs to contemporarily document their transfer pricing, as a time window
of 30 days is usually too short for an adhoc provision of comprehensive and correct transfer
pricing documentation.
2.2.2 Controlled foreign corporation rules
Germany applies since the 1970s strict CFC rules to prevent German MNEs from profit shifting
to low-tax jurisdictions. Basically, this is enforced through a save harbor foreign corporate tax
rate of 25% that (majority owned) foreign low-tax subsidiaries' passive income must be at least
8
subject to. If 25% is undercut, foreign low-tax subsidiaries' passive income would be treated
as if it was generated by the German parent (and, hence, taxed with the German corporate tax
rate10). Although German CFC rules are not particulary concerned with tax-motivated trans-
fer pricing, yet the rules have implications for IP-related transfer pricing. German CFC rules
define foreign low-tax subsidiaries' royalty and licence income from IP as passive income if
the underlying IP was not genuinely developed by the respective foreign low-tax subsidiary.
Hence, if the underlying IP had been reallocated to (or acquired by) low-tax subsidiaries, Ger-
man CFC legislation allocates the respective IP income to the German parent's tax base. In this
case, the IP income is taxed with the (higher) German corporate tax rate, no tax relief results.
Thereby, German CFC rules should prevent German parents' profit shifting to foreign low-tax
subsidiaries.
In September 2006, a ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) rather unexpectedly
restricted the application of CFC legislation within the European Economic Area11 (EEA). The
ECJ decision affected also German CFC rules. As I argue in the following, the cessation of
CFC legislation enabled German MNEs to shift profits via IP-related transfer pricing. German
MNEs' IP transactions with low-tax subsidiaries had until September 2006 been subject to two
different German anti-shifting provisions. Transfer pricing legislation generally applied to all
IP-related transfer prices. CFC rules were particulary concerned with cases where IP was not
originally developed by low-tax subsidiaries. After September 2006, however, only transfer
pricing legislation remained.
10 Between 2002 and 2008 the German corporate tax rate is approximately 40%. Up from 2008, Germany's
corporate tax rate is around 30%.
11 The European Economic Area consists of the EU member states, Island, Liechtenstein, and Norway.

3 Hypotheses
The rational behind the legal obligation to document transfer prices is to to disentangle transfer
pricing from any tax motive. According to transfer pricing rules, only (MNE-external) market
prices can serve as valid references, i.e. arm's-length prices. Market prices are supposed to be
free of any tax motives. Hence, MNEs that are obliged to strictly refer their transfer prices to
arm's-length prices should have no scope for tax-motivated transfer pricing. The documentation
is essential for the enforcement of the rules. Transfer pricing documentation is supposed to
create a transparency in MNEs' transfer pricing procedures that enables tax authorities to check
whether transfer prices comply with the tax law. This implies, however, that the enforcement's
effectiveness should crucially depend on whether tax authorities can verify the information
(in particular, the reported arm's-length prices) that MNEs provide in the documentation. As I
argue in the following, in this point the numerous MNE-internal transactions might substantially
differ. I derive in the following separate hypotheses for different types of service transactions.
The assessment whether a transfer price is in line with the arm's-length principle should
for tax authorities be the easier, the more common a service transaction is, i.e. the more firms
conduct similar, comparable transactions. Other firms' (MNE-external) prices could then serve
as a reliable reference, hence, arm's-length price. Transactions related to transport services are
examples for transactions with observable arm's-length prices. Transport costs mainly depend
on the transport distance and on the means of transport. These price components should (at least
approximately) be observable for tax administrations which makes similar transport transactions
of different firms comparable with each other. Consequently, tax authorities could assess the
compliance of transfer prices with the arm's-length principle. The leeway for tax-motivated
transfer pricing should in case of transport services be very small.
10
In contrast, transactions related to intellectual property are examples for transactions without
observable arm's-length prices. An example for IP-related transactions are royalty payments,
payments by a third to the patent holder for the right to exploit the patent. Patents, a type of
intellectual property (IP), protect an exclusive right that is guaranteed uniquely by a sovereign
state to the patent holder. Due to the exclusive character of a patent, in case the rights to use
patents are forwarded to entities in the same MNE, tax administrations presumably have diffi-
culties to judge transfer prices (Grubert, 2003), as there are no other MNEs that conduct similar,
comparable IP transactions. Firm-external market values that could function as a reference for
the arm's-length price exist neither for the patent nor for the royalty. The case of licences, lim-
ited rights in IP, is similar. Firm-external market values that could be considered as a reference
for the arm's-length price do not exist neither for the underlying IP nor for the licence payment.
As it is in these cases unclear what the correct arm's-length price for a transfer price is, the
leeway for tax-motivated transfer pricing should be substantial.
There are cases of service transactions in which it is a priori unclear whether arm's-length
prices are fully observable and, thus, whether one would expect to observe tax-motivated trans-
fer pricing. Examples are advertising services, R&D services and IT services. For some cost
components, there should exist observable arm's-length prices, like cost for material and labor.
If, for instance, the R&D process involves specific knowhow or the usage of MNE-internal
patents or licences, however, it should be much more difficult to assess whether transfer prices
are in line with the arm's-length principle. Similar, transfer prices for IT services will be difficult
to judge if e.g. firm-specific software is provided. Consequently, the MNE-internal provision
of R&D services and IT services could provide some leeway for tax-motivated transfer pric-
ing. In case of advertising services, arm's-length prices should (at least partly) be observable.
Therefore, there should be limited leeway for tax-motivated transfer pricing.
11
During the entire analysis period (2001-2010), the institutional preconditions with respect
to taxation were such that German MNEs had incentives to reduce their aggregate tax burden
by shifting taxable base from the German parent to foreign (low-tax) subsidiaries. Germany
showed during the entire analysis period a relatively high level of corporate taxation. From 2001
to 2008, its statutory corporate tax rate of almost 40% is among the highest in the EU. Up from
2008, the corporate tax rate is around 30% (Table A9 presents for benchmark years statutory
corporate tax rates within the EU). Further, the repatriation of foreign subsidiaries' profits to
the German parent in form of dividends is exempt from German corporate tax (here, Germany
applies a tax exemption regime since 2001). The EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive ensures zero
withholding taxes on cross-border dividend payments between MNE entities located in EU
member states. Hence, the repatriation of profits from EU (low-tax) subsidiaries is free of any
withholding taxes.

Figure 1 illustrates changing German anti-shifting provisions over time and hypotheses
about German MNEs' responses in tax-motivated transfer pricing depending on whether arm's-
length prices are observable for tax authorities or not. Before the introduction of transfer pricing
legislation in 2003, I expect some room for tax-motivated transfer pricing. Although the arm's-
length principle has already been established and used as a reference by tax administrations
since 1983, the lack of a legal obligation for firms to establish standardized and comprehensive
transfer pricing documentation could provide opportunities for tax-motivated transfer pricing. I
do not expect any anticipation effects in case of the 2003 reform as the precise embodiment of
the new transfer pricing legislation was unknown until November 2003.
Once transfer pricing legislation is effectively in place, tax-motivated transfer pricing should
diminish in cases where arm's-length prices are observable. As compared to the period before
2003, legally required comprehensive transfer pricing documentation should enable tax author-
ities to enforce the (observable) arm's-length principle more effectively. Further, through the
obligation to provide comprehensive documentation, MNEs' compliance with the arm's-length
principle could increase. As MNEs have to justify every transfer price with an arm's-length
price that complies with tax law, the scope for tax-motivated transfer pricing potentially nar-
rows. Since the new rules meant a major change in the practice of transfer pricing, I expect that
it took MNEs some time to actually adapt their transfer prices.12 Consequently, transfer prices
for transport service imports should at some point after January 2003 become independent from
foreign subsidiaries' corporate tax rates (Figure 1 H1). With respect to the tightening of trans-
fer pricing legislation in 2008, I do not expect any further impact as MNEs should already fully
comply.
12 The precise embodiment of the new transfer pricing legislation was unclear until November 2003. Once the
German Ministry of Finance published the circular that more precisely determined type, content, scope, and
time of provision of transfer pricing documentation in November 2003, MNEs could have adopted the new
rules.
13
In cases where arm's-length prices are unobservable, I expect transfer pricing legislation
to be ineffective. In case of genuinely developed IP this implies that tax-motivated transfer
pricing should have existed during the entire time span. In the case of non-genuinely developed
IP I do expect tax-motivated transfer pricing to occur once the ECJ decision in 2006 severely
restricted the application of the German CFC rule within the EU. Therefore, tax-motivated
transfer pricing related to IP should (within the EU) only occur after 2006 when the German
CFC rule is suspended. Hence, I expect a negative sensitivity of MNE-internal royalty and
licence payments and R&D related transfer prices (in case IP is involved) with respect to foreign
subsidiaries' corporate tax rates up from 2006 (Figure 1 H2). The tightening of transfer pricing
legislation in 2008 should have no effect on MNEs' tax-motivated transfer pricing related to IP,
as the 2008 reform provides no solution to the key problem that arm's-length prices for IP are
unobservable.
4 Data
The analysis is based on a dataset that consists of two linked databases: the Microdatabase
Direct Investment (MiDi) and the Microdatabase Statistics on International Trade in Services
(SITS).13 The MiDi comprehends annual unconsolidated firm-level panel data on German out-
bound foreign direct investment (FDI). As German firms investing abroad are legally required to
report, MiDi includes comprehensive and reliable balance sheet information on almost all for-
eign subsidiaries of German firms (for details see Lipponer, 2011). The SITS includes monthly
data on German MNEs' international service transactions that exceed a reporting threshold of
12,500 Euro (for details see Biewen et al., 2013). As reporting of international service trans-
actions is legally obligatory for German MNEs, the SITS provides comprehensive and reliable

partners. The SITS and the MiDi have common numeric firm identifiers that can be used to link
both databases.
From the MiDi, I retrieve information on German MNEs' subsidiary locations. I consider
subsidiaries which are owned at at least 50% by their German parent. Further, I only include
corporations. I exclude all MNEs operating in the agricultural, mining and banking sector as
well as governmental institutions and private households which are generally subject to different
tax rules. Using the numeric firm identifiers, I merge information on German MNEs' EU service
imports from SITS. A unique feature of the dataset is that different types of transactions are
included. I include in the analysis transactions related to (1) transport service imports, (2) R&D
service imports, (3) IT service imports, (4) royalty and licence payments related to IP, and (5)
advertising service imports.
I define MNEs' transactions as firm-external if they are conducted with countries that are not
subsidiary locations. In contrast, I assume firm-internal transactions if they are conducted with a
country which is the location of at least one MNE subsidiary in the respective year. The dataset
provides for the firm-internal case not sufficient information to eventually determine whether
the transaction partner is the respective subsidiary or a third party. This data restriction implies
for the analysis that MNEs' tax-motivated transfer pricing will potentially be underestimated.
Hence, the estimates provide lower bounds for the tax sensitivity of transfer prices.
Previous research found tariffs and exchange rates to be important determinants of trade
prices (see e.g. Clausing, 2003; Bernard et al., 2008). As I focus on German MNEs' transactions
with transactions partners that are located in the member states of the EU as of 200414 and all
EU member states are part of the European Union Customs Union (EUCU), there are no tariffs

on service transactions with these countries. With respect to exchange rate fluctuations, there is
so far no consensus in the literature on how to prevent bias from exchange rate fluctuations in
transfer pricing analyses.15 In the following analysis the values of transactions with non-Euro
countries are converted into Euro using the respective foreign currency's average nominal Euro
exchange rate from a fixed month, January 2001.16 In doing so, I ensure that transfer prices are
not artificially altered by fluctuations of the exchange rate.
Tables A4 to A8 provide descriptive statistics on the analysis sample listed by transaction
type for three reference years. Information on statutory corporate tax rates and statutory tax
rates on royalty and licence income stem from Ernst & Young's annually published Worldwide
Corporate Tax Guides. The resulting dataset allows to analyze German MNEs' tax-motivated
transfer pricing related to service imports and royalty and licence payments from 2001 to 2010.
It comprehends 654,021 observations on German MNEs' import transactions for the time period
January 2001 to December 2010.
Figure 2 traces quarterly mean residual values that result from a regression of transport
service import transactions on a set of EU-country indicators (to control for the transport-
price determinant distance), Figure 3 traces quarterly mean transaction values related to royalty
payments. If there is tax-motivated transfer pricing, hence, a tax-driven deviation of transfer
prices from arm's-length prices, MNE-internal should exceed external average transaction val-
ues when the foreign corporate tax rate is relatively low. In this way, tax base would be shifted
to the foreign low-tax subsidiary. In case the foreign corporate tax rate is relatively high, MNE-
internal transaction values should be smaller than externals. The dashed lines in the Figures
depict MNE-internal transactions, the solid lines MNE-external transactions. The graphs cover
15 Some studies apply nominal exchange rates (Clausing, 2003), others real exchange rates (Bernard et al., 2008)
as control variables. In some studies the problem is ignored (Grubert, 2003; Overesch, 2006; Davies et al.,
2014). In turn, Swenson (2001) purges transaction values of country-year effects.

25% and the upper panels to transactions with (low-tax) countries with a statutory tax rate below
25%.17
Figure 2 traces quarterly mean residuals of transaction values related to German imports
of transport services. The comparison of the upper panel with the lower panel does not reveal
any patterns that would suggest tax-motivated transfer pricing during the analysis period. Mean
residuals of internal and external transaction values differ in most periods, however, the arising
gaps do not clearly correspond to tax minimization considerations. The graphs suggest that
even in the absence of obligatory transfer pricing documentation requirements (before 2003)
MNEs' transfer prices for transport service imports were not tax motivated.
The idea to compare internal transfer prices to external market prices in order to detect
tax-motivated transfer pricing draws on the rational behind the the arm's-length principle. An
alternative approach is to consider tax-sensitivities of transfer prices, thus, compare transfer
prices paid to low-tax subsidiaries with transfer prices paid to high-tax subsidiaries. Figure 4
traces quarterly mean residuals of transfer prices related to German imports of transfer services.
The dashed line represents transfer prices paid to low-tax subsidiaries, the solid line transfer
prices paid to high tax subsidiaries. The graphs reveals a pattern that indicates tax-motivated
transfer pricing at the beginning of the analysis period: mean transfer prices paid to low-tax
subsidiaries clearly exceed those paid to high-tax subsidiaries until the end of the year 2004.
Up from 2005 mean transfer prices for service imports are at a similar level. German transfer
pricing rules were introduced in 2003. Given that market values, i.e. arm's-length prices for

17
transport services are observable, the disentangling of transport transfer prices from any tax
motive happened within a time span of approximately three years.
Figure 3 traces means of German royalty and licence payments to high-tax countries (lower
panel) and low-tax countries (upper panel). The comparison of the upper and the lower panel
shows that up from the cessation of CFC legislation in September 2006, the average of internal
royalty and licence payments exceeds externals if foreign corporate tax rates are low. In con-
trast, MNE-internal and MNE-external royalty payments to high-tax countries are at a similar
level during the entire analysis period. This suggests tax-motivated IP-related transfer pric-
ing to low-tax countries - despite transfer pricing legislation. Tax-motivated transfer pricing
even continues beyond 2008 when German transfer pricing legislation was further tightened.
Therefore, the graphs suggest that transfer pricing legislation relying on an enforcement of the
arm's-length principle as mechanism to prevent profit shifting seems to be ineffective in case of
IP where arm's-length prices are unobservable. For the time period before 2006, the findings
indicate that CFC legislation effectively prevented profit shifting via IP-related transfer pric-
ing. Interestingly, until the end of 2006, average MNE-internal royalty payments to low-tax
subsidiaries were very low (absolutely and relative to average external royalty payments). This
reflects the incentives provided by German CFC legislation. Under CFC legislation, royalty
income of foreign low-tax subsidiaries would be principally taxed at the level of the German
parent (at the then German corporate tax rate of 40%) if the underlying IP was not originally
developed by the respective low-tax subsidiary (independent from whether the transfer prices
were at a arm's length or not). Obviously, MNEs did ensure not to accumulate passive profits in
their CFCs. An interesting implication of this finding is that German MNEs apparently did not
develop IP in the considered low-tax subsidiaries. Because if they had, they could have used the
IP to conduct profit shifting even under the then CFC legislation. As transfer pricing to low-tax
18
subsidiaries starts only after the suspension of CFC legislation, it seems that MNEs conduct
IP-related transfer pricing based on IP that is tax-optimally reallocated to low-tax subsidiaries
(after it was developed somewhere else).
In terms of tax sensitivity of MNE-internal royalty and licence payments, Figure 5 clearly
illustrates the tax motive behind IP-related transfer prices for the time period after the suspen-
sion of German CFC rules. Up from the last quarter of the year 2006, transfer prices paid to
low-tax subsidiaries exceed those paid to high-tax subsidiaries. The pace of MNEs' response
is remarkable. The graphs reveal that after transfer prices were at similar levels until the end of
2006, transfer prices to low-tax subsidiaries rise sharply after the CFC rules's suspension within
two quarters of years.18 The reform of German transfer pricing legislation in 2008 seems not
to decrease the tax-driven gap between the mean transfer prices. The gap continuous to enlarge
even after 2008. However, at the end of the analysis period in 2010 the difference between the
mean transfer prices seems to decrease. Whether this decrease in tax sensitivity is persistent
or not, however, cannot be analyzed with the data at hand due to the lack of observations after
2010.
The argument is that transfer pricing legislation relying on an enforcement of the arm's-
length principle as mechanism to prevent tax-motivated transfer pricing is ineffective in case of
IP where arm's-length prices are unobservable. Indeed, transfer prices for MNE-internal roy-
alty and licence payments seem to respond to taxes despite transfer pricing rules (Figure 5).
Similarly, Figure A4 in the appendix shows for R&D-related transfer prices a pattern in tax sen-
sitivities that suggests that transfer prices are tax-driven after the CFC rules suspension in 2006
- despite transfer pricing rules that are supposed to enforce arm's-length prices. However, the
scope for profit shifting seems to be much smaller in case of R&D transfer prices as compared
18 This quick response in MNEs transfer pricing is in line with ? who find that MNEs are generally very flexible
in changing their transfer pricing strategies.

to the case of MNE-internal royalty and licence payments. Further, the pace of the response in
R&D transfer prices to the suspension of CFC rules is lower. In line with previous findings in
the literature (Grubert, 2003), Figure A6 in the appendix reveals no tax motive behind transfer
prices for advertising services. Further, transfer prices for IT services seem not to depend on
foreign corporate tax rates either (Figure A5 in the appendix).
5 Empirical strategy
The empirical analysis investigates the tax sensitivity of MNEs' transfer prices over the time
period 2001-2010. I test whether MNE-internal transaction values vary systematically with for-
eign tax rates in years where the respective MNE-internal transaction values are not (effectively)
subject to anti-shifting provisions. I estimate the following regression model for repeated cross-
sectional data (Stock and Watson, 2007) that provides tax sensitivity estimates for transaction

The variable transaction valueit is the value of the transaction i at time t. internali is an

The model specification in equation 1 includes a set of interaction terms that allows the
tax sensitivity of MNEs' transaction values to vary over time and, importantly, between MNE-
internal and MNE-external transactions. The partial effect of tax rates on the transactions value
in the model, which is indicative of the tax sensitivity, is:

Referring to H1, the case where arm's-length prices are observable, I expect a negative
tax sensitivity of transfer prices for transport service imports before 2003. As transfer pricing
legislation is introduced in 2003, however, I expect for subsequent years (presumably with some
delay after 2003) transfer prices to be unrelated to foreign corporate tax rates due to effective
transfer pricing legislation.
Under CFC legislation, I do not expect MNE-internal transaction values of royalty and li-
cence payments to be sensitive with respect to foreign corporate tax rates (H2). Neither I expect
R&D transfer prices to respond to foreign corporate tax rates. After the German CFC rules' sus-
pension in September 2006, MNEs are unrestricted in tax-motivated IP-related transfer pricing
as transfer pricing legislation is expected to be ineffective due to unobservable IP arm's-length
prices. Therefore, I expect MNE-internal royalty and licence payments and transfer prices for
R&D service imports to respond negatively to foreign corporate taxation. In case of advertising
service imports and IT service imports it is a priori not clear whether one would expect transfer
24
prices to respond sensitive to taxation as market prices should at least for some components of
the transfer price be observable.
6 Empirical analysis
This section presents estimates of annual tax sensitivities of MNEs transfer prices (equation 2).
Figures 6 - 10 show graphical depictions of the tax sensitivities for the five considered types
of transactions. The marginal effects are derived from the estimates of OLS regressions of
equation (1). The full regression results are presented in the Tables A1 - A3 in the appendix.
The dependent variable in the regressions is the transaction value in thousand euros.
For transport service imports, the red line in Figure 6 traces the annual tax sensitivities of
transfer prices. It reveals a statistically significantly negative relation between foreign corporate
tax rates and transfer prices in the early 2000s that diminishes towards the mid-2000s. The neg-
ative relation diminished, as expected, with some delay after 2003. Up from 2005 the marginal
effect of taxation on transfer prices is, like in the case of external transaction values, statistically
insignificantly different from zero. One reason for the delay in the response of MNEs' transfer
pricing to the new transfer pricing legislation might be the fact that the precise embodiment of
the new rules was unclear until November 2003, which is eleven month after the law's intro-
duction.20 Another reason could be that the new transfer pricing rules meant a major change
for transfer pricing practice. Therefore, it took MNEs some time to fully implement the new
documentation requirements and to adjust their transfer prices in order to comply with the new
legislation. For the year 2004 the results imply a difference between transport transfer prices
that MNEs pay to low-tax subsidiaries as compared to high-tax subsidiaries is 335,000 Euro
on average. Referring to the average transfer price paid to high-tax subsidiaries for this type

of transaction that is around 425,000 Euro in the fourth quarter of 2004, this translates into a
tax-driven increase by 78% in transfer prices if paid to low-tax subsidiaries.21

Figures 7 - 9 present tax-sensitivity estimates for IP-related transfer prices. For MNE-
internal royalty and licence payments, the red line in Figure 7 indicates no statistically sig-
nificant relation between corporate tax rates and transfer prices until 2006. Up from 2006,
MNE-internal royalty and licence payments depend negatively on foreign corporate tax rates,
though the marginal effects do not in all years achieve statistical significance at conventional
levels22. Still, the point estimates show economically significant values and reveal a substan-
tial relationship in the data set which represents the entire population of royalty and licence
payments made by German MNEs. According to the empirical results, the difference between

in high-tax countries.
22 F-tests of the overall significance of the regression very strongly reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients
are zero. Hence, the model explains some variation in transfer pricing.

transport transfer prices that MNEs pay to low-tax subsidiaries as compared to high-tax sub-
sidiaries is in the year 2007 207,000 Euro on average. Referring to the average MNE-internal
royalty and licence payment to high-tax subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2007 that amounts
to 121,000 Euro, this implies a tax-driven increase in transfer prices by around 170% if paid to
low-tax subsidiaries.23
The results for R&D services, which potentially include some sort of IP usage, show similar
patterns in tax-sensitivities of transfer prices over time (red line in Figure 8). Transfer prices
for R&D services respond up from 2007 negatively to foreign corporate tax rates. The tax sen-
sitivities are statistically significant at the 10% significance level up from 2009. The difference
between transfer prices for R&D services that MNEs pay to low-tax subsidiaries as compared
to high-tax subsidiaries is in the year 2009 1,270,000 Euro on average. Given an average R&D

service transfer price of 672,000 Euro paid to high-tax subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2009,
this translates into an increase of almost 200% in transfer prices paid to low-tax subsidiaries.
The results show no tax-minimization motive behind transfer prices neither in case of IT
services (Figure 9) nor in case of marketing services (Figure 10). The finding that transfer prices
for marketing services do generally not respond to taxation is in line with previous findings by
Grubert (2003) who shows for the case of US MNEs that marketing-related transactions are
typically not employed for profit shifting.
Concerning the economic significance of the findings, the effects describe strong responses
of transfer prices with respect to corporate taxation in the absence of anti-shifting legislation,
particulary in cases of IP-related transactions. Depending on the transaction type, transfer prices
paid to low versus high-tax subsidiaries differ between 78% and and almost 200%. Given that
the data set does not allow to exactly distinguish between MNE-internal and MNE-external
transactions, the analysis reveals lower bounds for the tax sensitivities of transfer prices. Hence,
the true effects could even be larger.
7 Conclusion
This paper provides an in detail assessment of MNEs' tax-motivated transfer pricing from 2001
to 2010. I study the tax sensitivity of transfer prices for certain service imports and royalty
and licence payments during a time period of changing anti-shifting legislation. On the one
hand, transfer pricing legislation in Germany was introduced in 2003 and tightened in 2008. On
the other hand, German CFC legislation, that prevented profit shifting via IP-related transfer
pricing, is suspended by a ruling of the ECJ in the year 2006.
The results provide empirical evidence for tax-motivated transfer pricing during the entire
decade. Depending on the at the time applicable anti-shifting legislation, however, MNEs target

different types of service transactions for profit shifting via transfer pricing. The findings show
transfer pricing rules to be effective in case of service transactions with observable arm's-length
prices. In contrast, the results clearly reveal the short-comings of transfer pricing legislation
in case of IP where an effective enforcement of the arm's-length principle is very limited as
arm's-length prices are unobservable. Up from 2006, when CFC legislation was ineffective due
to a decision of the European Court of Justice, MNEs start profit shifting via IP-related transfer
pricing - despite comprehensive transfer pricing legislation. This suggests that, before 2006,
German CFC legislation (and not German transfer pricing legislation) effectively prevented
profit shifting via IP-related transfer pricing. The tightening of transfer pricing legislation in
2008 seems not to effectively prevent profit shifting via IP-related transfer pricing in the short
term. This suggests that even the then tighter transfer pricing legislation could not effectively
solve the problem that the arm's-length principle is difficult to enforce in case of IP as arm's-
length prices that could serve as a reference cannot be observed by tax authorities.
The empirical findings provide a couple of important policy implications. In case of trans-
fer prices with observable arm's-length prices transfer pricing legislation increases firms' com-
pliance with the arm's-length principle. Here, policy makers should, however, be aware that
transfer pricing documentation requirements go with a cost-benefit trade-off: transfer pricing
documentation requirements improve MNEs compliance with the arm's-length principle and,
therefore, generate tax revenues but also impose considerable enforcement and compliance cost
on tax administrations and firms. In this constellation, there is an efficient level of transfer
pricing documentation which, once exceeded, creates economic inefficiencies.
Further, certain transaction types e.g. marketing services seem generally not to be employed
for tax-motivated transfer pricing by MNEs. In the literature, there is so far no clear explana-
30
tion for this finding.24 However, if governments knew that certain types of transactions are
for particular reasons generally not used for tax-motivated transfer pricing, cutting down on
documentation requirements for these types would provide efficiency gains.
The empirical results reveal the ineffectiveness of transfer pricing legislation in preventing
IP-related transfer mispricing. The fundamental problem is that arm's-length prices for IP and
IP-related transactions are unobservable for third-parties like tax authorities, as there are usually
no (firm-external) market prices that could serve as a reference. Therefore, it is very difficult
for tax authorities to estimate arm's length prices for IP-related transactions such as patents or
licences. A range of uncertainty that companies seem to exploit. As transfer pricing legislation
selectively relies on documentation requirements to enforce the arm's-length principle and to
prevent profit shifting, there is a need for a fundamental change in tax policy to effectively
prevent base erosion caused by IP-related transfer mispricing.
The OECD, which once established the arm's-length principle as the international consen-
sus on profit split in case of transfer pricing, is also aware of the problem of IP-related transfer
mispricing (see Action 8 of action plan OECD, 2013). However, so far, the OECD has not been
considering the arm's-length principle as the fundamental problem. Instead, first recommen-
dations resulting from the current OECD initiative against "Base Erosion and Profit Shifting"
promote even stricter and even more comprehensive transfer pricing documentation require-
ments to enforce the arm's-length principle in case of IP more effectively (OECD, 2014a,b).
My empirical findings question whether this rigidly holding to the status quo will be effec-
tive. Even if firms are obliged to document IP arm's-length prices even more comprehensively,
there is still the very fundamental problem that these documented arm's-length prices are for
24 Grubert (2003) argues that advertising intensive US companies engaged in many fewer intercompany transac-
tions and, therefore, had fewer opportunities for shifting income. However, I find advertising service imports
with a total of 41,187 transactions in the dataset to be the second most frequent transaction type and around
55% of these transactions are MNE-internal.

exploiting this for tax planning.
