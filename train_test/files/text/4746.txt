Although there is a range of advice available for communi-
cating with adolescents about mental health problems, aimed
at parents (Eisenberg, Sieving, Bearinger, Swain, & Resnick,
2006; Riesch, Jackson, & Chanchong, 2003; Vangelisti,
1992) and health professionals (Hardoff & Schonmann,
2001; Lerand, Ireland, & Boutelle, 2007), most of this advice
is based on anecdote and individual opinion. There is little
information to guide adults in the general community on
these matters. In addition to mental health problems, adoles-
cents may be struggling with other sensitive issues such as
substance misuse (Bergen, Martin, Roeger, & Allison, 2005),
same sex attraction (Beyondblue, 2012), bullying and abuse
(Hemphill et al., 2011), body dissatisfaction (Hay, Mond,
Buttner, & Darby, 2008), relationship problems, and physical
development or illness. While some adults may be comfort-
able in communicating with adolescents on these topics, oth-
ers may find it difficult. In particular, they may not feel
confident in assisting a young person with a mental health
problem (Kelly et al., 2011).
Adolescence and early adulthood is often the time when
mental health problems first arise. Data from the 2007
Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing
(NSMHWB; Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008) showed
that 26% of young people aged 16 to 24 years met criteria for
a mental illness. Yet, around three out of four of them did not
access mental health services in the previous 12 months
(Slade, Johnston, Oakley Browne, Andrews, & Whiteford,
2009).
When adolescents do seek help, it is more likely from
informal sources such as friends and family (Rickwood,
Deane et al., 2007) where a trusting relationship is already
established. In contrast, formal help seeking implies convers-
ing with a mental health professional, who is often a stranger.
Some adolescents may find it difficult to trust someone they
do not know and feel too shy, embarrassed, or afraid to dis-
close their most private experiences with them (Rickwood,
2001, 2002; Wilson, Bignell, & Clancy, 2003) or are con-
cerned about possible breaches of confidentiality, for exam-
ple, from a school counselor (Wilson & Deane 2001a, 2001b).
An unhelpful past experience with sources of help can
significantly impact on future help-seeking intentions, as can
beliefs such as "seeking help would not be useful," or that "I

Development of Guidelines for Adults on
How to Communicate With Adolescents
About Mental Health Problems and Other
Sensitive Topics: A Delphi Study

Abstract
There is little evidence-based information available to guide adults in the general community on communicating effectively
with adolescents about mental health problems or other sensitive topics. The Delphi methodology was used to develop
guidelines to fill this evidence gap. An online questionnaire containing potential guideline statements was developed following
a literature search and input from two focus groups. Two expert panels (Youth Mental Health First Aid instructors and
young consumer advocates) rated the questionnaire over three rounds, according to whether or not they believed that the
statements should be included in the guidelines. Results were analyzed by comparing endorsement rates between the panels.
Of the 175 statements presented, 80 were rated as essential or important by 90% of both panels and were included in the
guidelines. The Delphi process has offered an effective way to achieve consensus between expert panels on useful tips to help
adults communicate with adolescents.

should be able to sort out my own problems" (Rickwood,
Deane, Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2005; Rickwood, White, &
Eckersley, 2007). Some adolescents do not seek help because
of the stigma around mental illness and concern that they
will be judged negatively by others (Hinshaw, 2005; Jorm &
Wright, 2007; Walker, Coleman, Lee, Squire, & Friesen,
2008).
Adolescents with high levels of depressive symptoms
(Sawyer et al., 2012) as well as those with suicidal ideation
are less likely to seek help for their symptoms (Deane,
Wilson, & Ciarrochi, 2001; Wilson, Deane, & Ciarrochi,
2005). Adolescent males have particularly low levels of help
seeking (Rickwood et al., 2005). According to data from the
2007 NSMHWB, 22.8% of young men aged 16 to 24 met
criteria for a mental disorder in the previous 12 months but
only 13.2% of them accessed mental health services (Reavley,
Cvetkovski, Jorm, & Lubman, 2010). This is of major con-
cern as 27.8% of all male deaths aged 15 to 24 years in 2011
across Australia were due to suicide (Australian Bureau of
Statistics, 2013).
Low emotional competence (or not having the language
and skills to recognize, interpret, and share emotional experi-
ences) is an inhibitor to help seeking. Boys and young men
tend to have lower levels of emotional competence (Wilson &
Deane, 2001a, 2001b) compared with girls and young women
(Rickwood, 2001, 2002). Because adolescents often have low
levels of mental health literacy, they lack the appropriate rec-
ognition of disorders, knowledge of help-seeking options,
and effective treatments, which may lead to delays in seeking
help and inappropriate help seeking (Jorm et al., 2006; Wang,
2007). Adults can play an important role in actively engaging
with adolescents, rather than waiting for them to initiate help
seeking (Sawyer et al., 2012) by recognizing that there is a
mental health problem, providing information, encouraging
professional help, and providing support (Highet, Thompson,
& McNair, 2005; Jorm & Kitchener, 2011; Kelly, Kitchener,
& Jorm, 2013). It is vital that adults have knowledge and
skills about providing help for a mental illness and be able to
communicate this to the adolescent. As there is no current
benchmark to guide adults in the general community on this
topic, guidelines are needed.
The aim of the current study was to develop guidelines for
adults in the general community to communicate effectively
with adolescents about mental health problems and other
sensitive topics such as substance misuse, same sex attrac-
tion, bullying and abuse, body dissatisfaction, relationship
problems, and physical development or illness. The guide-
lines are aimed at adults who are not necessarily the adoles-
cent's parent, for example, family members, teachers, sports
coaches, employers, employees, chaplains, or other service
personnel who have contact with adolescents.
Method
It would be unethical to undertake a randomized controlled
trial to evaluate the best way for an adult to communicate
with an adolescent who may be developing a mental illness,
as it implies that only one group of adolescents would receive
the intervention (i.e., communication tips), while the control
group may receive substandard care (Miller & Brody, 2002)
that could expose those adolescents to harms such as deterio-
ration of mental health. Therefore, the accompanying guide-
lines were developed using a literature search and focus
groups to develop questionnaire statements, and the Delphi
consensus method to rate statements. The study was approved
by the Mental Health Research and Ethics Committee of the
Royal Melbourne Hospital (ID: 2009.658).
Literature Search
A literature search was used to find existing information on
tips for adults to communicate with adolescents in general,
as well as on mental health and other sensitive issues. This
included journal articles, books, websites, and carers' manu-
als. Searches were conducted on Google Scholar, PubMed,
PsychInfo, and Academic Search Premier, using the terms
"effective communication with" OR "guidelines to/for
engag*," "listening to" OR "communicat* with" OR "com-
municat* tips for adults" OR "talking with" OR "sensitive
issues and" OR "mental health" AND "teen*/adolescent*/
youth/young people/person."
Information that was aimed purely at parents was
excluded, as much of this was written in the context of a
parent­adolescent relationship and could not be applied to
adults in the broader community. Similarly, literature that
focused on communication tips for health professionals was
also excluded, as this was aimed at engagement in the "con-
sulting room." Any communication tips that were more
appropriate for counseling or therapy were not included, as
these were beyond the scope of providing initial assistance to
an adolescent by adults in general. Statements that did not
describe an action were excluded, as were statements aimed
at specific scenarios.
Participants
Two focus groups--one of consumers, the other clinicians--
were recruited from Orygen Youth Health (Orygen), a youth-
specific mental health service in Melbourne, Australia. One
group comprised current or past clients from Orygen who
were part of a consumer advisory group. An overview of the
project was presented during a meeting of the group, fol-
lowed by an email invitation from the group coordinator to
include those absent. Only those who considered themselves
to be functioning well were encouraged to volunteer. In total,
seven were recruited comprising two males and five females.
The other group, comprising clinicians and case managers
from Orygen, was invited by email to participate. These cli-
nicians were invited on the basis of having had experience of
treating severely distressed adolescents and who could con-
tribute to discussion on communication techniques that were
effective in those instances. As with the literature search, any
Fischer et al. 3
techniques used in counseling or therapy were omitted as it
would be inappropriate for adults in the general community
to assume the role of a clinician. In total, five clinicians were
recruited, comprising a male and four females.
Each group met separately for 1.5 hr. The consumers
received a small gratuity for participating. Each group was
advised that an audio recording would be made during the
meeting and all participants signed a consent form. The
groups were facilitated by one of the authors (C.M.K.) while
another author (J.A.F.) took notes. To guide focus group dis-
cussion, the following questions were posed:
Consumer group
"Think about a time when you were a teenager when you were
talking to an adult and you really felt that they were
communicating effectively with you. Don't think about a very
distressing time, or tell us what the conversation was about.
Think about what they said, how they said it and their body
language. What was it that made you feel heard and understood?"
In order to avoid possible distressing memories of a failed
attempt at communicating with an adult (or its consequences),
consumers were not asked to reflect on techniques that did not
work for them.
Clinician and case manager group
"Reflect upon what you find works and does not work when
communicating with young people. Think about how an adult
can make a young person feel comfortable, heard and understood
when talking to them, e.g., body language, what the adult can
say and how they should say it."
Questionnaire Development
JAF transcribed the audio recordings from each focus group
and extracted identified patterns of meaning to create poten-
tial themes (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Data around each poten-
tial theme were grouped into paragraphs. This process was
replicated for text found in the literature search and com-
bined with focus group data. Ideas within each paragraph
were written as statements to create draft questionnaire
items. This involved writing one idea per statement, with no
ambiguity, written as an action, with minimal overlap with
other items. A working party of the authors met to discuss
and refine the draft items to ensure uniformity while trying to
remain as faithful as possible to the original wording or
source.
The questionnaire was divided into six sections: planning
your approach (10 items), engaging with the adolescent
(45 items), what to say and how (49 items), body language
(22 items), discussing options (20 items), and handling dif-
ficulties in the conversation (8 items). Cultural items were
included within these headings and were written in general
terms so that they could be applied to a broad range of cul-
tures, including that of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples.
Expert Panelists
Two panels of experts were recruited to complete the online
questionnaire: a professional panel with expertise in adoles-
cent mental health (Youth Mental Health First Aid instruc-
tors) and a panel of youth mental health consumer advocates
aged 18 to 25 years. This age range was chosen because it
involved young people who were close to the adolescent age
group but mature enough to reflect on what would be appro-
priate communication. The professional panel was recruited
by emailing all accredited Youth Mental Health First Aid
(MHFA) instructors currently practicing within Australia.
Many hold additional roles such as teacher, registered nurse,
school counselor, trainer, and CEO, or manager of a mental
healthordisabilityservice.Outof383instructorsapproached,
68 agreed to participate (18%). Of these, 16 were male and
52 were female, aged between 23 and 64 years with a mean
age of 43 years.
The young consumer advocates were recruited from two
services from across Australia, via an email request sent
from their internal networks on behalf of the authors. The
first was ReachOut, which is an online community space for
young people with an emphasis on mental health and well-
being. ReachOut has a group of ambassadors from which six
panel members were drawn; two ambassadors volunteered
from each of the following states: Western Australia, New
South Wales, and Queensland. The second service was
beyondblue, Australia's national depression initiative, which
has a consumer advocacy group called "bluevoices." An
email was sent to 140 bluevoices members, of whom 20
agreed to participate. In total, the consumer advocates panel
comprised 26 participants aged between 18 and 25 years
with a mean age of 22 years, of whom 3 were male and 23
were female.
Delphi Method
The Delphi method (Jones & Hunter, 1995) provided a sys-
tematic basis to gauge expert consensus between the panel of
young mental health consumer advocates and Youth MHFA
instructors on items for guideline inclusion. This involved
making private, independent ratings of agreement with a
series of statements in a questionnaire.
The panelists' task was to rate the statements according to
how important they believed each item was for inclusion in
guidelines on communicating effectively with an adolescent
about mental illness or other sensitive issues. Items were
rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 = essential,
2 = important, 3 = do not know/depends, 4 = unimportant,
5 = should not be included. Panelists were advised that some
of the items may seem contradictory or controversial, but
were included because they reflected the wide range of peo-
ple's beliefs about communication.
Survey responses were analyzed by obtaining group per-
centages for consumer advocates and Youth MHFA instruc-
tors for each item. The following cutoff points were used:
4 SAGE Open
1. Items rated as "Essential" or "Important" by at least
90% of both panels were accepted for inclusion in the
guidelines.
2. Items rated as "Essential" or "Important" by at least
90% of one panel, or between 80% and 89.9% of
both panels, were re-rated in the subsequent round.
3. All other items were rejected.
For each round of the study, panelists were sent an email
with a link to an online questionnaire uploaded to
SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com), which could be
completed at a time that was convenient to each panel mem-
ber. Those who partially completed the questionnaire could
log back in at another time to finish it. Reminder emails were
sent to partial and noncompleters, and they were granted
another 2 weeks to complete it. Panelists were emailed a
report 2 weeks after each round of the study had closed. This
was to give participants enough time to read over the report
and compare their personal rating (of items to be re-rated)
with those of other panelists, before a link to the next round
was sent.
Round 1
The questionnaire contained 154 items, divided into six sec-
tions. At the end of each section, panelists could make com-
ments on any ambiguity or wording of the items presented
and could suggest additional items. A blank field was pro-
vided for writing comments. It took approximately 45 min to
complete the questionnaire. Consent was implied by respond-
ing to the survey.
Comments received from panel members in Round 1
were analyzed by JAF, who drafted new items from feed-
back. The working group reviewed the comments and refined
the additional items. Only suggestions that represented a new
idea, were considered unambiguous, and were actions were
accepted as additional items. New items that were variations
of items rejected in Round 1 were also not accepted. In total,
21 were accepted for Round 2 of the questionnaire.
The report fed back to each panel member at the end of
Round 1 listed items that had been accepted, rejected, and
required re-rating. It contained a statistical summary of indi-
vidual and group ratings for items that needed re-rating.
Panelists were offered the chance to maintain or change their
rating in Round 2, in view of the group's response.
Round 2
The Round 2 questionnaire contained 59 items, comprising
items to be re-rated and any new items created from Round 1.
It took approximately 30 min to complete. The Round 2
report listed items that had been accepted, rejected, and
required re-rating. Items that fell into the re-rate category at
the end of Round 2 (after already being re-rated at the end of
Round 1) were excluded from the next round.
Round 3
The Round 3 questionnaire contained nine items, which were
re-rates of new items generated from comments by the panel-
ists during Round 1. It took approximately 10 min to com-
plete. The report for Round 3 listed items that were endorsed
or rejected.
Results
Table 1 shows the continuity of participation across the three
rounds. There was a slightly higher percentage of males than
females in the instructor expert panel (23%), compared with
the consumer expert panel (12%).
Figure 1 shows the rates of inclusion, exclusion, and re-
rating of the items in each round of the questionnaire. From
a total of 175 items, 80 were endorsed and 95 were excluded.
Endorsed items were written into prose by JAF to create the
draft guidelines. These were emailed to the research-working
group who refined them further, before being emailed to the
expert panelists with a request for comments or minor
changes. Along with the draft guidelines, panelists were sent
a full list of items that had been endorsed or rejected through-
out all survey rounds. The final version of the guidelines
appears in Appendix A.
Discussion
Of the 80 items that were endorsed by both panels, there was
100% agreement between them on 10 items, depicted by an
asterisk in Appendix B. Themes were around treating the
adolescent with respect, using good listening skills, helping
the adolescent find sources of help, and discouraging stigma-
tizing attitudes.
There was a high level of agreement between panels about
the need for adults to be aware of differences in an adoles-
cent's culture regarding the way in which they use and inter-
pret body language. Both panels also agreed that although

some adolescents prefer confiding in adults of their own cul-
tural background, it is best to ask adolescents individually if
they prefer this.
Despite this consensus, there were some interesting dif-
ferences between panels. Items that were not rated as
"Essential" or "Important" by at least 90% of both panels
were excluded from the guidelines, as perAppendix C. These
items may reflect broad differences of opinion between pan-
elists on issues regarding judgment, discretion, and the ado-
lescent as an individual. Consumers were more likely to
endorse self-disclosure by adults, including sharing their
experience of a mental health problem with an adolescent. In
contrast, most instructors disagreed with this idea citing pro-
fessional boundaries and organizational policies.
Another difference was around asking the adolescent
directly about their risk of harm. All instructor panelists
believed that it is best for the adult to ask directly. However,
it was not endorsed highly enough by consumers in order to
be included in the guidelines. Other studies have reported
that many adults and young people are reluctant to ask
directly about suicide (Jorm et al., 2005; Jorm, Morgan, &
Wright, 2008; Jorm & Wright, 2007), perhaps because of a
concern that this might increase risk. This issue is addressed
in the attached guidelines (Appendix A) by referring to
Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors: First Aid Guidelines
(2008a) and Deliberate Non-Suicidal Self-Injury: First Aid
Guidelines (2008b), which emphasize the importance of ask-
ing an adolescent directly if they are feeling suicidal.
Limitations
Because panelists who rated the items were all fromAustralia,
it is not known if the guidelines are generalizable to other
countries or to cultural minorities. The study may contain a
female gender bias given there were so few males in all
groups, that is, 20% of focus group clinicians, 29% of focus
group consumers, 12% of expert panel consumers, and 23%
of Youth MHFA instructors. The low response rate from cur-
rently practicing Youth MHFA instructors (18%) may mean
responses are not representative of the wider instructor com-
munity. There were different sizes in group composition, for
example, the consumer expert panel was around 2.5 times
smaller than that of the Youth MHFA instructor panel.
However, equal weighting was given to ratings by consumer
panelists and instructor panelists to eliminate bias caused by
unequal panel size. While a methodological weakness of the
study is that focus groups were posed with slightly different
questions to generate feedback, the researchers considered it
important to focus on "what works" for consumers to avoid
potential distress from reflecting on what has not worked for
them.
Strengths
The items endorsed for inclusion in the guidelines go beyond
individual opinion. By using the Delphi methodology, these
guidelines have been informed by group consensus, which
includes consumers who have had experience with mental
illness, as well as instructors who deliver the Youth MHFA
course to adults. The high level of consensus for items (90%)
between these diverse groups is another strength.
A particular strength is the involvement of young con-
sumers as experts. Future studies should encourage more
consumer input in research, particularly from males, to cap-
ture viewpoints from these important groups.
The guidelines are written with enough flexibility to be
applied by adults who are acquainted with the adolescent, to
those who are not, and may also assist adults who do not
have much contact with adolescents. They encourage the use
of language that is free of stigma and assist the adult to
explore the adolescent's issues sensitively. They complement
the existing suite of guidelines available from Mental Health
First Aid Australia (www.mhfa.com.au) and will be incorpo-
rated in updates to the Youth MHFA manual (Kelly et al.,
2013) and curriculum for future courses.
Conclusion
This process has shown that it is possible to develop com-
munication guidelines that are acceptable to both profession-
als and mental health consumers. While the guidelines will
be used within the context of Mental Health First Aid

usefulness in the wider community. It is hoped that the guide-
lines will help facilitate effective communication with ado-
lescents in general and, where required, assist conversations
around mental health or other sensitive topics.
Appendix A
Guidelines for Adults on How to Communicate
With Adolescents About Mental Health Problems
and Other Sensitive Topics
Purpose of these guidelines. These guidelines are designed to
provide practical tips for adults in the general community,
such as family members, teachers, sports coaches, chaplains,
employees, employers, or other service personnel, to com-
municate effectively with adolescents about mental health
problems and other sensitive topics. Other sensitive topics
may include: substance misuse, same sex attraction, bullying
and abuse, body dissatisfaction, relationship problems, phys-
ical development or illness.
How to use these guidelines.These guidelines are a general
set of recommendations about how an adult can communi-
cate with an adolescent. These communication tips are
designed to be suitable for use in developed English-speak-
ing countries. They may not be suitable for other cultural
groups or for countries with different health systems.
When using these guidelines, please do not apply them
prescriptively. The guidelines tend to be general whereas
each adolescent and their situation are unique. Consider the
following:
·
· Each adolescent's needs are different and decisions
should be made according to what is believed to be in
the best interests of the adolescent.
·
· Adapt your approach and style of the interaction
appropriately, according to your role or type of rela-
tionship that you have with the adolescent, for exam-
ple, as a parent, teacher, friend, coach, or employer.
In situations where the adult has an organizational respon-
sibility, any relevant organizational policy needs to take pre-
cedence to these communication guidelines.
Development of these guidelines.These guidelines are based
on the expert consensus of a panel of young mental health
consumer advocates from beyondblue and ReachOut
(Inspire), and currently practicing Youth Mental Health First
Aid instructors within Australia.
What is adolescence? Although there are a number of defini-
tions of adolescence, here it is defined as those aged between
12 and 18, or the years that a young person generally attends
high school. However, adolescence can start earlier than 12
years and can continue through to the early 20s, so these
guidelines could be relevant when helping people who are a
little younger or older.
What is a mental health problem? Mental health problem is
a broad term that includes developing mental illness, symp-
toms of a diagnosable illness, substance misuse, and adverse
life events that are having an impact on functioning.
Guideline sections
1. Planning your approach. Sometimes, an adolescent
may approach you about a sensitive topic, but at other
times, you will need to take the initiative. When you
are making the approach, plan to talk to the adoles-
cent privately about your concerns at a time and place
that is convenient for both of you and free of distrac-
tions. You could try asking where they feel most
comfortable or safe to talk. Be aware that the adoles-
cent may not wish to open up to you until they feel
that you care enough, are trustworthy and willing to
listen. The adolescent may hide or downplay their
problem if they feel guilty about upsetting or disap-
pointing you. Some adolescents (especially boys)
may fear opening up about their problems in case
their vulnerability is perceived as weakness.
Consider whether you are the best person to
approach the adolescent. For example, adolescents
from a different cultural background may prefer con-
fiding in adults from the same background. However,
do not assume that this is always the case--ask what
they would prefer.
2. Engaging with the adolescent. To engage with the
adolescent, be honest by "being yourself," as adoles-
cents can be particularly tuned in to anyone who is
"faking it." Try to set aside your own concerns and
focus on those of the adolescent, giving them your full
attention. Remember that each adolescent's situation
and needs are unique. You should be nonjudgmental
and treat them with respect and fairness at all times.
Be caring and show warmth toward the adolescent and try
to be reliable and consistent in your behavior with them.
Take the time to build rapport and trust--this could be done
by expressing an interest in and curiosity about the adoles-
cent. If the adolescent has disengaged from others, it is
important that you allow additional time to build trust.
Convey a message of hope to the adolescent by assuring
them that help is available and things can get better. However,
do not make any promises to the adolescent that cannot be
kept.
Be careful not to communicate a stigmatizing attitude
about the adolescent's sensitive issue and be careful in apply-
ing labels to the adolescent that they may find stigmatizing,
for example, "mentally ill," "drug addict," or "gay." Be
Fischer et al. 7
aware that the adolescent may hold a stigmatizing attitude
toward their own sensitive issue. Choose your words care-
fully so as to not offend the adolescent.
3. What to say and how. Tell the adolescent that you
want to help. Talk "with," not "at," the adolescent.
Do not do all of the talking. As far as possible, it is
preferable to let the adolescent set the pace and style
of the interaction. After speaking, be patient and
allow plenty of time for the adolescent to collect their
thoughts, reflect on their feelings, and decide what to
say next. Although you should encourage the adoles-
cent to lead the conversation, do not be afraid to ask
open, honest questions during the course of discus-
sion. Ask the adolescent about their experiences and
how they feel about them, rather than make your own
interpretation.
Do not only think about what you are saying but
also how you are saying it. For example, consider the
volume and the tone of your voice--this includes the
vocal pitch and the attitudes that are conveyed. Stay
calm, use a calm voice and steady tone, and never
raise your voice if you can help it.
If the adolescent does not wish to discuss the problem with
you, reassure them that they do not have to talk about or
reveal anything until they are ready to do so. Let the adoles-
cent know that when they want to talk, you will listen to them.
If the adolescent appears distressed by what they are
experiencing, explain to them that help is available. If the
adolescent is in a potentially harmful situation (e.g., experi-
encing abuse or bullying), let them know that you want to
keep them safe. You should also explain the limits of confi-
dentiality. For example, anything that affects the safety of the
adolescent or others (such as abuse or suicidal thoughts or
behavior) may need to be discussed with someone who can
act to keep the adolescent (or others) safe. For more informa-
tion, please see the other guidelines in this series: Suicidal
Thoughts and Behaviors; First Aid Guidelines and Traumatic
Events: First Aid Guidelines for Assisting Children.
There may be times when you are having a private discus-
sion with the adolescent and other people arrive. In these
situations, you should take a moment to ask the adolescent in
private, what they would like to do (e.g., continue the discus-
sion in front of others, ask others to leave, or schedule
another time to continue your discussion).
When communicating with an adolescent, there are a
number of things that are best avoided. These include trivial-
izing the adolescent's feelings by using statements such as,
"When you're older . . ." or "Back in my day . . ." as this may
appear dismissive of the adolescent and their experiences.
Similarly, phrases such as "snap out of it" or "stop thinking
that way" should be avoided. When talking with the adoles-
cent, scare tactics or threats should not be used, for example,
"If you keep thinking like this, you'll end up in big trouble."
Also, avoid sounding condescending or patronizing, and
avoid stereotyping adolescents. For example, "Why are peo-
ple your age always difficult and argumentative?" Be careful
not to disagree or minimize the adolescent's thoughts and
feelings as this may appear dismissive of their experience,
for example, "You're not depressed. You're just bored."
Finally, if you find that you have said something in error,
be up front and address the error as soon as you can.
4. Body language. Be aware of the adolescent's body
language, as this can provide clues as to how they are
feeling or how comfortable they feel about talking
with you. Try to notice how much personal space the
adolescent feels comfortable with and do not intrude
beyond that.
Be aware of your own body language and what
this conveys when communicating with the adoles-
cent (e.g., posture, facial expressions, and gestures).
Use cues such as nodding to keep a conversation
going with the adolescent. Be aware that different
cultures use and interpret body language in different
ways, for example, the amount of eye contact or per-
sonal space may vary.
Avoid negative body language such as crossing your
arms, hands on hips or looking uninterested. Also, avoid dis-
tracting gestures such as fidgeting with a pen, glancing at
other things, or tapping your feet or fingers, as these could be
interpreted as a lack of interest.
5. Discussing options. Before discussing possible
courses of action, you need to listen attentively and
sensitively to the adolescent and give them a chance
to fully express and explore their issue. This is so you
can avoid offering ill-considered or inappropriate
advice, or minimizing or dismissing the problem,
based on only "half the picture."
When giving advice, try not to judge a situation on
what you would do yourself but have a discussion
with the adolescent about what they think would be
Communication is a two-way process--how well you listen is just
as important as how well the adolescent is expressing themselves.
The following listening skills can help:
·
· Listen to the adolescent without interruption, and allow
them to talk about their experiences and beliefs if they
want to.
·
· Make a conscious effort to listen, to hear the feelings and
meaning behind the adolescent's words and respond to
this. For example, when the adolescent says, "Why can't I
use the car? Others are allowed!" It could mean, "I feel like
you don't trust me. I want you to treat me as a responsible
person."
·
· Actively listen and use questions to check your
understanding and acknowledge that you have heard what
the adolescent has said.

helpful. Discuss with and help the adolescent to
assess different courses of action and to understand
the consequences of each.
Sometimes outside help is needed. Recommend that
the adolescent contact the relevant professional (e.g.,
teacher, doctor, or counselor) as early as possible to talk
about what they have been experiencing. If the adolescent
resists seeing someone about their problem, give them
helpline phone numbers or websites that offer assistance
to adolescents, as these are anonymous and may be less
confronting.
6. Handling difficulties in the conversation. Be aware
of any barriers to the adolescent's communication,
for example, language difficulties, finding the right
words or an inability to express emotion. Some ado-
lescents do not communicate well verbally, and it is
important to adapt to their needs and abilities.
If the adolescent does not feel comfortable talking
to you, encourage them to discuss how they are feel-
ing with someone else and help them find a suitable
person to talk to. If the adolescent asks you for help
but you do not know much about the problem, you
should still try to support the adolescent and assist
them to get other help.
If the adolescent's initial reaction to you is negative, you
should not presume that they do not want your help. Be
aware that sometimes adolescents struggle to ask for assis-
tance, or reject help when offered, even if they feel that a
situation is out of control. Try not to put pressure on the ado-
lescent to open up to you, if they do not wish to talk right
away. Let the adolescent know that you are available for
them to talk to you, when they are ready.
If the adolescent appears to have stopped listening to you,
try to change the way you say or do things. If the adolescent
makes negative comments or does not want to talk about their
problem, you should not take it personally. If the adolescent is
being antagonistic or argumentative, you should not respond
in a hostile, disciplinary, or challenging manner.
If you are left feeling bewildered or distressed following
a discussion with the adolescent, confide your feelings to a
trusted friend or health professional while maintaining the
adolescent's privacy.

Round
Planning your approach
 The adult should ask the adolescent where they feel more comfortable or safe to talk. 1
 The adult should make sure that they approach the adolescent privately about their experiences at a time and place that is
convenient and free of distractions.
1
 The adult should be aware that the adolescent may feel more able to discuss their problems when no one else is listening. 1
 The adult should be aware that the adolescent may not wish to open up until they feel that the adult cares enough, is
trustworthy, and is willing to listen.
2
 The adult should be aware that some adolescents (especially boys) may fear opening up about their problems in case their
vulnerability is labeled as weak.
2
 The adult should be aware that the adolescent may hide or play down their problem if they feel guilty about upsetting or
disappointing the adult.
2
 Although some adolescents prefer confiding in adults of their own cultural background, do not assume that this is always the
case--ask if they would prefer this.
3
Engaging with the adolescent
 The adult should let the adolescent know that they are available to talk when the adolescent is ready and should not put
pressure on the adolescent to talk right away.

1
What to say and how
 aThe adult should be a good listener. 1
 The adult should not do all the talking. 1
 As far as possible, the adult should let the adolescent set the pace and style of the interaction. 1

 The adult should never raise their voice if they can help it. 1
 The adult should ask the adolescent to explain their experience rather than make their own interpretation. 1

their feelings, and decide what to say next.
1
 The adult should actively listen and use questions to check their understanding and acknowledge that they have heard what
the adolescent has said.
1
 The adult should talk "with," not "at," the adolescent. 1
 The adult should avoid trivializing the adolescent's feelings by using statements such as, "When you're older . . ." or "Back in
my day . . ." as this may appear dismissive of the adolescent's perspective of their own experience.
1
 The adult should not use scare tactics or threats when talking to the adolescent, for example, "If you keep thinking like this,
you'll end up in big trouble."
1
 The adult should avoid telling the adolescent to "snap out of it" or "stop thinking that way." 1
 If the adolescent is in a potentially harmful situation (e.g., experiencing abuse or bullying), the adult should reassure the
adolescent that they want to keep them safe.
1
 The adult should explain the limits of confidentiality, for example, anything that affects the safety of the adolescent or others
(such as abuse or suicidal thoughts or behavior) may need to be discussed with someone who can act to keep them safe.
1
 If the adult is having a private discussion with the adolescent and other people arrive, the adult should take a moment to ask
the adolescent in private what they would like to do (e.g., continue the discussion in front of others, ask others to leave, or
schedule another time to continue your discussion).
1
 The adult should tell the adolescent that they want to help. 2

Items Excluded From the Communication Guidelines.
Round
Planning your approach
 The adult should be aware that the adolescent is more likely to engage with them in a place that is within the adolescent's
comfort zone (e.g., in a café or at home).
2
 When approaching the adolescent, it may be helpful for adults to be aware of the adolescent's cultural background, local
cultural norms, and hierarchy within their culture.
3
 The adult should be aware that the adolescent may find it easier to talk during a time-limited activity that has a definite end
point.
1
 The adult should be aware that it may be easier for the adolescent to talk during activities that do not require a lot of eye
contact.
1
 The adult should be aware that the adolescent may feel more comfortable talking to people of similar age about their
problems or experiences.
1
 The adult should be aware that adolescents from diverse backgrounds may be more comfortable talking to an adult from
their own culture.
1
 The adult should be aware that the adolescent may feel more at ease about opening up to others who also have the same
sensitive issue.
1
 The adult should use a mutual activity as an opportunity to talk with the adolescent about a sensitive issue, for example,
going shopping, going for a drive, or going for a walk.
1
Engaging with the adolescent
 The adult should use a friendly attitude when speaking with the adolescent (rather than treat the adolescent as they would
an adult friend or peer).
2
 The adult should treat the adolescent as responsible and capable of making decisions. 2
 The adult should talk openly with the adolescent about the sensitive issue. 2
 The adult should talk openly with the adolescent about the sensitive issue, taking into consideration the adolescent's age. 2
 The adult should talk openly with the adolescent about the sensitive issue, taking into consideration the adolescent's
maturity.
3
 As a basis for discussion, it is sometimes useful for the adult to talk about how the adolescent's sensitive issue is portrayed in
the media (e.g., Does the media glamorize or spread myths about the particular issue?)
2
 aThe adult should not avoid speaking with or offering help to the adolescent out of fear that the adult may say or do the
wrong thing.
2
 aThe adult should not use slang with which they are unfamiliar, as the adolescent will recognize that the adult is not being
genuine.
2
 aThe adult should try to empathize with how the adolescent feels about their beliefs and experiences. 2
 aThe adult should offer the adolescent consistent emotional support and understanding. 2
 aThe adult should acknowledge the adolescent's expertise about their own life. 2
 aThe adult should praise the adolescent when they've acted in a responsible way. 2
 aThe adult should be mindful of their own gender and that of the adolescent, and how this may relate to the adolescent's
current experience or previous trauma (e.g., an adolescent female who confides in a male adult about sexual abuse).
2
 aThe adult should ask the adolescent about the impact of their culture or background, rather than assume what this might be. 2
 aThe adult should be aware that the adolescent may hold a stigmatizing attitude toward their sensitive issue. 2
 aThe adult should talk openly with the adolescent about the sensitive issue. 2
 aThe adult should show a confident manner when interacting with the adolescent. 3
 The adult should not compare the adolescent's life to their own experiences at that age. 1
 The adult should offer their first name to create a less formal atmosphere--using titles such as doctor or mister creates a
hierarchy, which the adolescent may perceive as wanting power over them.
1
 The adult should take the time to engage with the adolescent first (e.g., getting them to talk about their interests and social
life) before discussing personal issues about any problems that the adolescent may be experiencing.
1
 If the adult does not know about things the adolescent is interested in, they should ask and find out from them. 1
 The adult should be aware that a laid-back or less formal dress sense helps to engage adolescents. 1
 If the adolescent cannot or does not want to talk about what they are experiencing, the adult should respect this and not
pry.
1
 The adult should talk to the adolescent as they would to a friend. 1
 The adult should lift the adolescent's spirits and help them feel more positive about themselves. 1
 The adult should avoid confronting the young person and should not criticize or blame them. 1
12 SAGE Open
Appendix C (continued)
(continued)
Round
 The adult should express positive attitudes about the adolescent's culture. 1
 The adult should familiarize himself or herself with technologies adolescents use as this may be a way of engaging adolescents
more personally and in a way they understand, for example, with social networking tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and
YouTube.
1
 The adult should avoid using ideas about the sensitive issue from television, movies, and the media when speaking with the
adolescent, as these are often both frightening and inaccurate.
1
What to say and how
 If the adult often uses long silent pauses, they should explain that they are just thinking about the adolescent's options and
talk to them through this, as the adolescent may otherwise misinterpret this negatively.
2
 The adult should offer positive feedback to the adolescent as this may encourage them to communicate with the adult, for
example, "I think it's great that you are willing to talk to me about this--it shows a great deal of maturity."
2
 If the adult has personal experiences of the sensitive issue, they should gauge whether or not it may be helpful to share these
with the adolescent on an individual basis.
2
 If the adult chooses to share their own personal experience of a similar sensitive issue as the adolescent, they should ask the
adolescent whether they want to hear it before going ahead.
2
 aWhen sharing a personal experience of the same sensitive issue (e.g., depression), and there have been difficulties in the
adult's recovery, the adult should be careful not to convey a bleak attitude toward recovery to the adolescent.
3
 aThe adult should use open-ended questions in order to get the adolescent's input into a conversation. Open-ended
questions are questions that cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," for example, "How are you feeling about
what happened?" instead of "Are you feeling OK about what happened?"
2
 aThe adult should take as much time as the adolescent needs to talk. 2
 aIf the adult has commenced talking with the adolescent about their issues but finds that they are running out of time, the
adult should reschedule another time to talk with the adolescent.
2
 aIf the adult is from a different cultural background to the adolescent, they may need to make some adjustments to their
usual style of communication, for example, the adolescent may be used to using physical terms (such as headache or
stomach ache) to describe their emotional experiences, be used to a different level of eye contact or personal space, or it
may not be appropriate in the adolescent's culture to speak alone with an adult of the opposite sex.
2
 aThe adult should offer alternative actions that could help with the problem and allow for compromise to give the adolescent
a sense of control.
2
 aIf a parent or guardian is present during a discussion with the adolescent, the adult should ensure that both the adolescent
and the parent/guardian have a chance to talk and ask questions.
2
 aIf the adult is concerned about the adolescent's safety or risk of harm, they should ask them directly about this. 3
 If the adult has approached the adolescent, they should be straightforward and explain their concerns. 1
 The adult should listen more than they talk to the adolescent. 1
 The adult should not overuse the adolescent's first name, as this may appear patronizing or over-familiar. 1
 The adult should use "I messages" to communicate their thoughts and feelings to the adolescent. "I messages" are statements
that tell the adolescent how the adult feels about their behavior and gives the adolescent an understanding of the effects of
their behavior without blaming the adolescent, for example, "I feel very upset when you . . ."
1
 The adult should use metaphor where appropriate. 1
 The adult should use humor where appropriate. 1
 The adult should not ask the adolescent to justify or explain their behavior as asking "why" can put the adolescent on the
defensive.
1
 The adult should pay attention to any topic the adolescent is finding distressing and avoid asking more about it. 1
 The adult should avoid steering the conversation toward the answer they think will "solve" the adolescent's problems. 1
 The adult should avoid telling the adolescent what they should do to solve their problems. 1
 If a parent or guardian is present during a discussion with the adolescent and the adult needs to ask the parent or guardian a
question, they should then turn to the adolescent and ask the same question.
1
 The adult should state that the topic may be sensitive, for example, "I want to talk to you about something, and it might be a
sensitive topic . . ."
1
 If the adult has personal experiences of the sensitive issue, they SHOULD share these with the adolescent, to normalize the
experience for them.
1
 If the adult has personal experiences of the sensitive issue, they should NOT share these with the adolescent. 1
 The adult should ENCOURAGE the adolescent to talk to them about their experiences and beliefs. 1

Round
Body language
 The adult should not make any comments about the adolescent's body language, for example, avoiding eye contact or
fidgeting.
2
 If the adult feels startled or disturbed by what the adolescent says, the adult should remain neutral (e.g., phrasing, vocal tone,
and body language).
2
 aIf the adolescent appears defensive, the adult should make their body language as open as possible by appearing relaxed,
keeping their palms out, sitting alongside the adolescent but angled toward them and keeping their voice calm and low.
2
 aThe adult should maintain a comfortable level of eye contact when speaking with the adolescent. 2
 aThe adult and the adolescent should be positioned at the same level so that they do not have to look up or down at each
other.
2
 aThe adult should be respectful of personal boundaries between themselves and the adolescent, but not to the point of being
afraid to show comfort, if the adolescent asks for it (e.g., a brief hug or pat on the shoulder).
3
 If the adolescent is relaxed and open, the adult should match their body language. 1
 The adult should sit in a relaxed position. 1
 The adult should sit face-to-face with the adolescent. 1
 The adult should sit side by side with the adolescent. 1
 When seated, the adult should lean forward to show interest when speaking with the adolescent. 1
 When talking with the adolescent, the adult should not sit behind a desk. 1
 The adult should maintain an appropriate distance with the adolescent in order to model clear personal boundaries. 1
 If the adolescent is distressed, the adult should convey a sense of comfort by offering a brief hug or simple touch. 1
 The adult should know the difference between "good" touching and "bad" touching when comforting the adolescent. Safe
touching is extremely healthy, and it is important for adolescents to have models of this.
1
Discussing options
 aThe adult should help the adolescent find solutions without trying to fix the problem for them. 2
 The adult should ask permission to give opinions or offer advice so that it is not seen as criticism or taken defensively. 1
Handling difficulties in the conversation
 If the adolescent feels more comfortable talking to people with similar experiences or people their own age, the adult should
recommend that the adolescent joins a support group.
2
 If the adolescent asks the adult for help and the adult does not know much about the problem, the adult should learn more
about that type of problem.
2
 aIf the adolescent is infringing the adult's personal space, the adult should talk to them directly about it. 2
 aIf the adolescent is expressing excessive anger or behaving aggressively, the adult should clearly state that they cannot
communicate with the adolescent if they are shouting or acting in a threatening way.
2
 aIf the adolescent is expressing anger, the adult should offer empathy and try to find out why they are feeling angry. 2
 If the adolescent appears distressed by what they are experiencing, the adult should normalize it by saying it is common for
adolescents to feel this way.
1
 If the adolescent is finding it difficult to express their emotions, the adult should offer a few terms to pick from to help them
find the language they are looking for. For example, "To me, you don't look very happy. Are you feeling sad, or angry, or
frustrated?"
1
 If the adolescent is distressed, the adult should convey a sense of comfort by using a few appropriate words, e.g. "It's OK.
I'm here."
1
 If the adult feels uncomfortable during their discussion with the adolescent, they should admit it. 1
 If the adult feels uncomfortable during their discussion with the adolescent, they should ask the adolescent if they are
uncomfortable also.
1
 If the adult is having trouble interpreting the adolescent's behavior, they should ask them directly to explain what they are
doing.
1
 If the adult is having trouble engaging or communicating with the adolescent, they should ask whether they would like some
help to find someone else to talk to, for example, a person of a different age or gender.
1
 If the adult feels uncomfortable with what the adolescent is saying, they should suggest that the adolescent find someone else
to speak to and ask if they would like any assistance with this.
1
 If the adolescent appears agitated, the adult should offer to take them outside for a walk while talking with them. 1
