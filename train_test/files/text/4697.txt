Introduction
How to pinpoint the position of the head in various syntactic
and morphological structures cross-linguistically has been
heavily debated in the relevant literature (Arcodia, 2012;
Bauer, 1990; Hudson, 1987; Polinsky, 2012; Zwicky, 1985
among others). The debate, in part, centers on the criteria
used to determine the head of a structure. In addition, the
types of the head, whether semantic, syntactic, or morpho-
logical, are a topic for debate among linguists (Allen, 1978;
Bauer, 2009; Lieber, 2010; Scalise & Fábregas, 2010). Due
to the fact that compounding is one of the most common
word-formation processes cross-linguistically, determining
the position of the head is of substantial importance. In this
study, I explore the notion of headedness in Arabic1 com-
pounds within the Construct State/Synthetic Genitive
Construction (SGC), taking into account the existing discus-
sion in the relevant literature.2 In particular, the study aims to
provide answers to the following research questions:
Research Question 1: Where is the head located in N +
N compounds and Adj + N compounds in Arabic?
Research Question 2: What are the types of head in N +
N compounds and Adj + N compounds in Arabic?
Research Question 3: Does the position of the head in N
+ N compounds and Adj + N compounds confirm the gen-
eralization that Arabic is predominantly left-headed?
The examples of Arabic compounds within SGC (see
"Applying Headedness Criteria toArabic Compounds Within
the SGC" section) used in this study were collected from
different sources: (a) Arabic books discussing the SGC (e.g.,
Al-Jurjaani, 2004), (b) the relevant literature on SGC (e.g.,
Altakhaineh, 2016a, 2016b; Fassi Fehri, 2012), (c) some
Arabic newspapers (e.g., Al-Ghad), and (d) my intuition as a
native speaker of Arabic. More than 500 examples were col-
lected, and these were categorized into compounds and
phrases based on whether the relationship between the two
elements is based on possession. In other words, all genitive
constructions were excluded, since they are regarded as
phrases, rather than compounds (see Altakhaineh, 2016a,
pp. 6-7). For word limitation reasons, only 36 examples were
discussed and analyzed in this study.
The study proceeds as follows: "Headedness" section pro-
vides an overview of the concept of headedness, discussing
the main proposed criteria of headedness. "Applying
Headedness Criteria to Arabic Compounds Within the SGC"
section uses the criteria to identify the position and type of
the head in Arabic compounds within the SGC. "The
Implications of the Headedness Criteria" section discusses
the implications of the headedness criteria on Arabic
compounds. Finally, "Conclusion" section summarizes the
main findings.

Headedness in Arabic Compounds within
the Synthetic Genitive Construction
Abdel Rahman Mitib Altakhaineh1
Abstract
This study aims to pinpoint the position of head in Arabic compounds within the Synthetic Genitive Construction (SGC). It
also examines the headedness of these compounds morphologically, syntactically, and semantically. The analysis confirms that
compounding in Arabic is predominantly left-headed. The semantic, syntactic, and morphological heads always coincide in
Arabic compounds within the SGC. With regard to Adj + N compounds in Arabic, I argue that a silent noun is responsible for
determining the syntactic category of the whole construct, resulting in a noun rather than an adjective. The study concludes
with recommendations for further research.

Headedness
Overview
In an important study of the general notion of headedness,
Zwicky (1985) indicates that "[t]he intuition to be captured
with the notion HEAD is that in certain syntactic constructs
one constituent in some sense `characterises' or `dominates'
the whole" (p. 2). According to Zwicky (1985), determining
the head relies on the idea that in any syntactic construct, one
element governs or dominates the rest of the elements within
that construct. However, there has been considerable debate
on the definition of the head (Arcodia, 2012; Croft, 1995;
Polinsky, 2012; Zwicky, 1985; among others). Some schol-
ars argue that a unanimous definition of what exactly a head
may be attainable (e.g., Hudson, 1987), while others disagree
(e.g., Polinsky, 2012, p. 348). The difficulty of giving a defi-
nition of the head stems from the problems facing linguists
when dealing with syntactic constructs. For instance, if the
phrase the dog is interpreted to mean a dog classified as a
definite object, then the determiner, that is, the, appears to be
the governing element. On the contrary, if the same phrase is
interpreted as a definite object, which is classified as a dog,
the governing element may be the noun, that is, dog. Arcodia
(2012, p. 367) notes that similar problems are also found in
morphology; these are discussed in detail in the "Headedness
Criteria in the Previous Literature" section.
In spite of such difficulties, there is a certain amount of
consensus about the headedness of many syntactic and mor-
phological constructs. In fact, languages are often divided
into two main types in terms of the position of the head. A
language is considered head-final when the head element is
usually or always placed in a final position, whereas head-
initial languages tend to place the head element in an initial/
left position. Using this criterion, Johannessen (1996) sug-
gests that Arabic is a head-initial language. The same point is
made by Fender (2008, pp. 106, 112) for colloquial forms of
Arabic as well as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). However,
neither Johannessen (1996) nor Fender (2008, pp. 106, 112)
discusses the position of the head in Arabic compounds.
Thus, this study aims to bridge this gap by examining the
head in Arabic compounding to determine whether com-
pounds are left- or right-headed.
With regard to English compounds, Williams (1981, p.
248) claims that the head of a complex word in English is
always the right element, formulated in his famous right-
hand head rule. Later, Selkirk (1982) proposes that the loca-
tion of the head, in general, is a parameter, that is, it can be
either the left or the right element of the word in a language.
In a sample of 36 languages, excluding Arabic, the overall
preference in nominal compounds is for right-headedness
(Bauer, 2001, p. 697). However, in many languages such as
Vietnamese and Mandarin, both left-headed and right-headed
compounds can be found, which means that the parametric
approach is insufficient to account for the position of the
head (Booij, 2010, p. 100).
The next section aims to shed more light on the definition
of headedness, both cross-linguistically and in Arabic. It pro-
vides a discussion of previous work on headedness in the
relevant literature, by examining the criteria discussed by
several scholars on what makes a certain element the head of
a construct, and then applies these criteria to compounds in
Arabic. The aim is to determine the position of the head in
Arabic compounds and to identify its properties.
Headedness Criteria in the Previous Literature
Many criteria relevant to determining the head of a particular
construct are discussed by Zwicky (1985). He proposes that
the notion HEAD needs to capture the intuition that, in cer-
tain syntactic constructs, one element will dominate the rest
(Zwicky, 1985, p. 2). He examines the following eight crite-
ria to identify an element as a syntactic head:
1. The head is the semantic argument, which means that
the element called "the head" has a meaning that acts
as an argument to a functor (predicate modifier or
connective). From a formal semantics viewpoint, a
functor is "a sign that attaches to one or more expres-
sions of given grammatical kind(s) to produce an
expression of a given grammatical kind" (Quine,
1982, p. 129).
2. The head is the element with which other constitu-
ents must agree, that is, it is the determinant of
concord.
3. The head is the element which is marked with mor-
phosyntactic features that indicate the syntactic rela-
tions between the construct as a whole and other
syntactic units in a sentence. In other words, the head
bears the inflections.
4. The head is the element that selects its sisters, that is,
it is the subcategorizand.
5. The head is the governor, which means that it can
determine or select the morphological form of its sis-
ter on the tree. For instance, in a V + NP construct,
the governor V assigns a morphological case to its
sister NP.
6. The head is the element which has the same distribu-
tion as that of the whole construct, that is, it is the
distributional equivalent.
7. The head is the obligatory element, in the sense that
if it is removed, the whole construct must be
recategorized.
8. From a dependency theory perspective, the head is
the element on which other elements rely in a depen-
dency analysis.
Publication of this list in Zwicky (1985) sparked some
debate about the correctness of some of these criteria and
the possibility of adding further criteria (see in particular
Hudson, 1987). The consensus view that developed is
Altakhaineh 3
summarized in Bauer (1990), who also points out that " . . .
although these criteria are neatly collected in the two arti-
cles mentioned, they do not originate there: the criteria
have been widely discussed in earlier literature on the sub-
ject" (pp. 2-3). Among the earlier scholars who addressed
the notion of headedness are Bloomfield (1935), Marchand
(1969, p. 214), Lyons (1977, p. 294), and Williams (1981,
p. 248), among others. Bauer's (1990, pp. 2-3) useful sum-
mary of past research on headedness criteria is provided
below:
1. A phrase is a hyponym of its head. Hudson (1987)
calls this a "kind of" relation. This principle was orig-
inally proposed by Allen (1978, p. 11), who refers to
it as the "IS A" condition. This condition suggests
that the whole compound denotes a subclass of the
concept that the head denotes.
2. The head is the subcategorizand; it is the item that
selects its sisters.
3. The head is the governor.
4. The head is the distributional equivalent of the whole
phrase.
5. The head is the obligatory element in the phrase.
6. The head is the "morphosyntactic locus."
7. The head is lexical (rather than phrasal).
The above-mentioned criteria can be used to identify the
head in a phrase and have been adopted to identify the head in
a compound (e.g., Arcodia, 2012). However, some of Bauer's
(1990, pp. 2-3) criteria may not be valid to identify the head in
a compound (Arcodia, 2012, p. 368). In particular, Criteria 3
(the head is the governor) and 7 (the head is lexical) are not
applicable to English compounds (Arcodia, 2012, p. 368).
Along these lines, Arcodia (2012) notes that "it should be evi-
dent that the characterization of heads is partly different for
derivation and compounding" (p. 370). However, the structure
of Arabic compounds, especially those formed in compliance
with the SGC, is quite different from that of English com-
pounds. This means that some criteria which are inapplicable
to English compounds may, in fact, be applicable to Arabic
ones. In the next section, I therefore use all of the seven criteria
compiled by Bauer (1990) to identify the head within a com-
pound in Arabic. I group the seven criteria under three broad
types, that is, semantic (Criterion 1), syntactic (Criteria 2-5),
and morphological (Criteria 6-7). In the next section, I apply
the above criteria to Arabic compounds within the SGC.
Applying Headedness Criteria to Arabic Compounds Within the SGC
In this section, I look closely at Arabic compounds within the SGC on the basis of Altakhaineh's (2016a, pp. 134-135, 172)
analysis in which he suggests that a SGC compound can be defined as a complex word that consists of at least two adjacent
words, and where the second element is normally non-referential. Altakhaineh (2016a) also notes that the second element of a
compound within the SGC is not, in most cases, freely pluralized, as in the following examples:
(1) findaan -aay-i
cup the-tea-GEN
"the tea cup"
(2) aruus l-bar-i
bride the-sea-GEN
"the mermaid"
lit. the sea bride
(3) qawiyy l-qalb-i
strong the-heart-GEN
"a brave person"
lit. the one with the strong heart
Altakhaineh (2016b, p. 277) also identifies types of compounds other than the SGC, suggesting that N + N compounds other
than the SGC, Adj + Adj compounds and reduplicated compounds can be either semantically double-headed or headless:
(4) ilu-un murr-un
sweet-NOM bitter-NOM
"bitter-sweet"
(5) sabaa-a masaa-a
morning-ACC evening-ACC
"all day long"
4 SAGE Open
(6) layla-a nahaar-a
night-ACC daytime-ACC
`twenty-four seven'
(Altakhaineh, 2016b, p. 291)
In this study, I focus on the headedness of compounds within the SGC (see Examples 1-3).
N + N Compounds
The semantic criterion. The semantic criterion of headedness is in essence simple: it states that the head of a compound is the
element that determines the semantic category of the whole compound, making a compound a hyponym of its head (Lieber,
2010, p. 178). For instance, in English, the word pole in flagpole is the head, since a flagpole is a hyponym of pole (Bauer,
2009, p. 348). In Arabic N + N compounds, the left element is usually the head, since it denotes a hypernym of the whole
compound, as in Examples 7 to 9:
(7) xaatam l-almaas
ring the-diamond
"the diamond ring"
(8) muallim l-fiizyaa
teacher the-physics
"the physics teacher"
(9) mudiir l-madrasah
principal the-school
"the school principal"
On the basis of Allen's (1978) principle, it is clear that
(10) xaatam lalmaas "the diamond ring" IS A xaatam "ring"
(11) muallim lfiizyaa "the physics teacher" IS A muallim "teacher"
(12) mudiir lmadrasah "the school principal" IS A mudiir "principal"
Examples 10 to 12 show that the left element is a superset of the whole compound, identifying them as endocentric com-
pounds. However, there are also exocentric compounds and those do not denote a type of the left element, as shown in
Examples 13 and 14:
(13) bayt d-darad
house the-stairs
"the stairwell"
(14) aruus l-bar
bride the-sea
"the mermaid"
lit. the sea bride
In Examples 13 and 14, bayt ddarad "stairwell" is not a type of bayt "house" and aruus lbar "mermaid" is not a type of
aruus "bride." Because Arabic compounds can be either endocentric as in Examples 7 to 9 or exocentric as in Example 13
and Example 14, it is necessary to recognize that the "IS-A" criterion cannot always be applied. But when it can, it always
points to the left-hand element being the head in N + N combination within the SGC.
The syntactic criteria. The first syntactic criterion addresses the notion of subcategorization in relation to headedness. In this
respect, Zwicky (1985) points out that
Altakhaineh 5
In some constructions, one slot has a special status in that the items that can fill that slot must be listed in the lexicon, while its sister
constituents are not so constrained. These are instances in which one constituent is SUBCATEGORIZED with respect to its ability to
occur with a particular set of sister constituents. (p. 5)
The notion "subcategorizand" has been subject to a wide debate, especially in relation to Determiner Phrases (DPs). For
instance, Arcodia (2012, p. 373) notes that it is not clear whether, in the phrase these black boxes, the noun boxes or the demon-
strative these is to be considered the subcategorizand (cf. Zwicky, 1985, pp. 5-6). It may be suggested that the determiner is
the subcategorizand, as it is well known that determiners are lexically subcategorized; they can combine with singular count
nouns (e.g., cat), plural count nouns (e.g., cats), or mass nouns (e.g., sugar). In fact, currently, several scholars (Abney, 1987;
Choi, 2014; Siloni, 1997) in the generative tradition would regard the determiner (these, a demonstrative) as the head of the
previous example these black boxes, which is termed DP, rather than NP.
With respect to compounding, in the endocentric English compound hairstyle, the right-hand element, that is, style is the
subcategorizand, since it (i.e., the head) selects the non-head (Arcodia, 2012, p. 373). Arcodia (2012) adds that "the definition
of head in endocentric compounding is closer to that of syntactic head" (p. 373); this would indicate that this definition works
with neither exocentric compounds nor coordinating compounds.
In Arabic, the left element of the compound selects a set of elements to accompany it, as in Examples 15 to 17:
(15) muallim l-fiizyaa
teacher the-physics
"the physics teacher"
(16) muallim l-fann
teacher the-arts
"the arts teacher"
(17) muallim t-taariix
teacher the-history
"the history teacher"
In Examples 15 to 17, the left element muallim "teacher" selects the type of words that can occur with it. In the above
examples, these are subjects which the teacher teaches, that is, lfiizyaa "the physics." lfann "the arts," and ttaariix "the
history." Therefore, the head muallim "teacher" is the subcategorizand, because it selects its sisters, which are in this
case school subjects. Note that this selection is due to the fact that the left element teacher has the verb teach inside it.
However, if we take the example sikkat ladiid "the iron railway" in Example 13, the right element is a modifier which
sometimes cannot be selected by the head, that is, when it is an adjunct. This means that the criterion does not work in
this case.
(18) sikkat l-adiid
rail the-iron
"the iron railway"
The second syntactic criterion is that the head is the governor (excluded by Arcodia, 2012, as it does not apply to English
compounds). In MSA compounds (Jordanian Arabic [JA] has no case markings), the left element can have any case, such as
nominative, accusative, or genitive on the basis of the function of the whole construct in the sentence, whereas the right ele-
ment is always in the genitive case, as exemplified by Examples 19 to 21:
(19) qaabala-ni muallim-u l-fiizyaa-i
met-me teacher-NOM the-physics-GEN
"The physics teacher met me."
(20) qaabalt-u muallim-a l-fiizyaa-i
met-I teacher-ACC the-physics-GEN
"I met the physics teacher."
6 SAGE Open
(21) taaddat-u ma muallim-i l-fiizyaa-i
talked-I with teacher-GEN the-physics-GEN
"I talked with the physics teacher."
In Example 19, the left element muallimu "the teacher" has nominative case (as it is the subject); in Example 20, it has accusa-
tive case muallima "the teacher" (being the object); and in Example 21, it has genitive case muallimi "the teacher" (as
required by the preposition ma ). On the contrary, the right element is always genitive in all examples. This can be accounted
for by saying that the head N governs its sister, assigning it as a genitive case.
The third syntactic criterion is that the head is the element which has the same distribution as that of the whole construct. For
example " . . . V is the distributional equivalent of V + NP, since the distribution of V + NP is roughly the same as the distribution
of Vs like write and vanish . . ." (Zwicky, 1985, p. 12). For English, the head is the element that determines the syntactic category
of a compound such as high school, which is syntactically a noun like school (Lieber, 2010, p. 178). However, it is very difficult
to identify which element of the compound is responsible for determining the syntactic category of the whole N + N compounds
in both English and Arabic, as both elements are nouns. Examples from Arabic are as follows:
(22) malik l-aabah
king the-jungle
"the lion"
(23) findaan l-qahwah
cup the-coffee
"the coffee cup"
The fourth syntactic criterion to identify the head is the obligatoriness of an element within the compound. This means that if
such an element is omitted, the outcome will be ungrammatical depending on the nature of the sentence. For instance, Bauer
(2009, p. 348) suggests that the word pole, in the compound flagpole, is obligatory, because pole can be used, but not flag,
without changing the meaning. In Arabic, the left element of a compound is obligatory, as in the following examples:
(24) (a) raayt-u muallim l-fiizyaa
saw-I teacher the-physics
 "I saw the physics teacher."
(b) raayt-u l-muallim / raayt-u muallim-a-n
 saw-I the-teacher / saw-I teacher-ACC.INDF
 "I saw the teacher." / "I saw a teacher."
(c) * raayt-u l-fiizyaa
saw-I the-physics
 *"I saw the physics."
(25) (a) kasart-u findaan l-qahwa
 broke-I cup the-coffee
 "I broke the coffee cup."
(b) kasart-u l-findaan / kasart-u findaan-a-n
 broke-I the-cup / broke-I cup-ACC-INDF
 "I broke the cup." / "I broke a cup."
(c) *kasart-u l-qahwa
 broke-I the-coffee
 "I broke the coffee."
Looking at Examples 24 and 25, the obligatory element is clearly the left element in the compounds mentioned above.
Examples 24b and 25b show that the left elements can stand on their own, whereas Examples 24c and 25c demonstrate that the
right elements cannot be used on their own, resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. Note, however, in the case of
Altakhaineh 7
non-compositional compounds, both elements are equally important to convey the meaning of the whole compound; neither
of them can be deleted, as shown in Example 26:
(26) (a) qaabalt-u raaid l-fadaa
met-I pioneer the-space
 "I met the astronaut."
(b) ?qaabalt-u r-raaid / qaabaltu raaid-aan
 met-I the-pioneer / met.I pioneer- INDF.ACC
 lit. " met the pioneer." / "I saw a pioneer."
(c) *qaabaltu l-fadaa
met.I the-space
 lit. I met the space.
Example 26b demonstrates that the first element can be used on its own, but the meaning of the whole compound is totally lost.
On the contrary, Example 26c shows that, in addition to losing the meaning of the whole compound, the second element does
not normally stand on its own. Note, however, that the grammaticality versus the ungrammaticality of what remains after the
first element of the compound is deleted relies heavily on the context of use. This can be illustrated with the following
example:
(27) (a) uubb-u muallim t-taariix
love-I teacher the-history
 "I love the history teacher."
(b) uub-u l-muallim
love-I the-teacher
 "I love the teacher."
(c) uub-u t-taariix
love-I the-history
 "I love the history."
In Example 26, deleting the left element results in a semantically anomalous sentence, whereas deleting the right element
yields a grammatically meaningful sentence even though the meaning of the whole compound is lost. On the contrary, in
Example 27, if either of the elements is omitted, the sentence would remain grammatical. This means that this criterion does
not yield a clear result here. The head alone will always be acceptable in any context where the entire compound is acceptable,
whereas the non-head alone is only sometimes acceptable in the some contexts. For instance, muallim ttaariix "the history
teacher" denotes someone like the left element, that is, muallim "teacher" rather than the right element, that is, ttaariix "the
history," which denotes "a subject to be studied at an academic institution." Therefore, it seems that this criterion is closely tied
to the first criterion, in which the whole compound is a hyponym of the head.
Another interesting observation with regard to the obligatoriness criterion is that, in certain contexts, the left element which
is supposed to be the head on the basis of Criteria 1, 2, and 3, can be omitted. This observation has been noted in particular
contexts such as those related to news headlines. Examples of such cases are illustrated below:
(28) fi aal assarra l-ayaan ala mawqifih min
in case insisted the-senators on stand.MSG from
t-tadiilaat . . .
the-amendments . . .
"In case the senate insisted on its stand regarding the amendments . . ."
 (Al-Ghad, September 16, 2015)
(29) n-nuwwaab yuqirr adadan min

articles law the-implementation
"the parliament has passed a number of articles pertaining to the implementation law."
 (Al-Distour, September, 15, 2015)
(30) l-muallimiin tatawaad alðneebaat ma qtiraab l-fasl
the-teachers threaten.MSG Althneebaat with approach the-term
d-diraasiyy
the-academic
"the teachers (union) threatens Althneebaat (the Minister of Education) with the approach of the 
academic term."
 (Khaberni News Agency, January 19, 2015)
In Examples 28 to 30, the left elements madlis "council," madlis "council," and niqaabah "union" of the compounds madlis
layaan "the senate," madlis nnuwwaab "the parliament," and naqaabat lmuallimiin "the teachers union" are deleted, respec-
tively. Only the right element remains to refer to the institution which the members, that is, senators, parliament members, and
teachers work in/represent. The deletion can be observed if one examines the cross-referencing marked on the element which
follows the compounds. In Example 28, the singular resumptive pronoun on the word mawqifih "stand" refers to the singular
ellipted antecedent madlis "council." In Examples 29 and 30, the resumptive pronouns marked on the verbs, that is, yuqirr "has
passed" and tatawaad "threatens" refer to the ellipted antecedents madlis "council" and niqaabah "union," respectively.
The phenomenon in which the people stand for or refer to the whole institution in which they work or represent is called
metonymy. In the context of newspapers, one may find instances in which one element of the compound is deleted, provided
that the other element which is not deleted can compensate for the loss of the omitted element. Another interesting aspect of
these metonymic compounds is that the left element is the one which is omitted, rather than the right element. This may indi-
cate that the right element is indispensable, whereas the left element is not, at least in relation to metonymic compounds. The
deletion of the left element may take place for verbal economy purposes. That is, instead of repeating the two elements
throughout the news article, it would be more economical if the whole compound is mentioned at the beginning only once, then
in the remaining sections, the author could delete one of the elements. Note, however, that such ellipsis is not possible with
other compounds, as in the following examples:
(31) * muallim l-fiizyaa aaib laakin l-kiimyaa aadir
teacher the-physics absent but the-chemistry present
Intended: "the physics teacher is absent but the chemistry teacher is present."
In English compounds too, deletion of the head sometimes takes place in some cases. Bauer, Lieber, and Plag (2013, p. 479)
note that several compounds that consist of two elements lose the right element, becoming metonymic expressions, for exam-
ple, chair for chairperson, business for business class, Tasman for Tasman Sea, the Tate for the Tate Gallery, and vacuum for
vacuum cleaner. They also suggest that the semantic outcome of this type of ellipsis in compounds appears to be similar to the
metonymy that occurs in syntactic ellipsis, for example, the House for the House of Representatives or that which takes place
without ellipsis, for example, Washington for the government in Washington.
The morphological criteria.The first morphological criterion to determine the head in a compound is the "morphosyntactic
locus." In Arabic compounds, the morphosyntactic locus seems to be the left element. First, pluralization has always been used
to identify the head (Bauer, 2009, p. 348). An example from English is schoolboy, which consists of school and boy and has
the plural schoolboys, based on the head boys. In Arabic, the left element of the compound is the one marked for number and
gender, as in Examples 32 and 33:
(32) (a) waraq-at l-imtiaan
 paper-FSG the-exam
 "the exam paper"
(b) awraaq l-imtiaan
 paper.FPL the-exam
 "the exam papers"
Altakhaineh 9
(33) (a) aruus l-bar
 bride.FSG the-sea
 "the mermaid"
 lit. the sea bride
(b) araais l-bar
 bride.FPL the-sea
 "the mermaids"
 lit. the sea brides
Examples 32 and 33 demonstrate that plural awraaq "papers" and araais "brides" are the heads of the compounds
awraaq limtiaan "the exam papers" and araais lbar "the mermaids" on the basis of the left element. In Arabic N
+ N compounds, the right element normally appears in the singular form, with a few exceptions where the right element
of the compound is always plural, as in Examples 28 to 30 and the compound raiis lwuzaraa "the prime minister" (see
Example 34).
In addition, the morphological gender can be used to demonstrate how the morphological locus can be determined, as in the
following Arabic compounds:
(34) (a) raiis l-wuzaraa
 president.MSG the-minister.MPL
 "the male prime minister"
(b) raiis-at l-wuzaraa
 president-FSG the-minister.MPL
 "the female prime minister"
(35) (a) aabir s-sabiil
 passer by.MSG the-path
 "the male passerby"
(b) aabir-at s-sabiil
 passer by-FSG the-path
 "the female passerby"
The left element of the above examples is the morphosyntactic locus, as it inflects for gender. In Examples 34 and 35, the femi-
nine form is raiisat lwuzaraa "the female prime minister" and aabirat ssabiil "the female passerby," with no changes to
the right element of the compound.
However, in some compounds, the gender and plurality tests fail to determine the head, as in Examples 36 and 37:
(36) ayn-u s-samaa-i
eye-NOM the-sky-GEN
"the sun"
(37) yawm-u l-isaab-i
day-NOM the-judgment-GEN
"judgment day"
For semantic reasons, these compounds cannot be marked either for number or gender. In such cases, a further morphological
property, that is, case, can be used to determine the position of the head:
(38) ayn-u s-samaa-i damiil-at-un l-yawm
eye.FSG-NOM the-sky.FSG-GEN beautiful-FSG-NOM the-day
"The sun is beautiful today."
10 SAGE Open
The adjective damiilatun "beautiful" agrees with the word aynu "eye" in case, both being nominative. Thus, the case test
here identifies aynu "eye" as the head. If the head was the noun ssamaai "the sky," the adjective damiilah should inflect
for genitive case, but this is ungrammatical, as shown in Example 39:
(39) *ayn-u s-samaa-i damiil-at-in l-yawm
eye.FSG.NOM the-sky.FSG-GEN beautiful-FSG-GEN the-day
"The sun is beautiful today."
The case test criterion thus looks fairly reliable for determining the morphosyntactic locus of compounds in Arabic. Note that
the case test cannot be applied in JA, as it has no case marking system. Therefore, if the plurality and gender tests are also
inapplicable, the morphological locus criterion cannot be used to determine the head in JA.
The second morphological criterion, pertaining to the head being lexical rather than phrasal (Zwicky, 1985, p. 5), has been
excluded by Arcodia (2012), as it does not apply to English compounding. However, this criterion does apply to Arabic com-
pounds, as the left element is lexical, whereas the right element can be phrasal, as in Examples 40 to 42 and many of the earlier
examples:
(40) mawqif l-aafilah
stop the-coach/bus
"bus stop"
(41) saaat s-sifr
hour the-zero
"the last hour"
(42) bayt d-darad
house the-stairs
"the stairwell"
In Examples 40 to 42, the left elements, mawqif "stop," saaah "hour," and bayt "house," are lexical items, whereas the right
elements laafilah "the coach," ssifr "the zero," and ddarad "the stairs" consist of the determiner l- "the" and the lexical
items aafilah "coach/bus," sifr "zero," and darad "stairs." Simply put, the right elements are DPs, consisting of DET + N.
This criterion thus seems to lend support to most of the above-mentioned criteria, by which the left element is usually shown
to be the head in Arabic compounding.
To sum up, seven criteria have been applied to N + N compounds in Arabic to identify the head. Despite a few limitations
of some of the criteria, it is clear that the head is the left element inArabic N + N compounds, which supports the generalization
that Arabic is a predominantly head-initial language. The next section discusses the types of head in Arabic Adj + N com-
pounds in relation to the above-mentioned criteria.
Adj + N Compounds
In this section, the headedness criteria discussed above are applied to Adj + N compounds in Arabic to identify the position
of the semantic, syntactic, and morphological heads. Semantically, Allen's (1978, p. 11) condition does not apply to Adj + N
compounds, because adjectives do not form super/subsets. With regard to the syntactic criteria, the first criterion concerning
subcategorization, does not apply either. Adjectives cannot be shown to be heads, as they do not select their sisters, that is,
nouns. Second, the left element is the governor; it can be nominative, accusative, or genitive based on the function of the
whole compound in the sentence, whereas the second element is always genitive, as in Example 43:
(43) (a) qaabala-ni asan-u l-xuluq-i
 met-me good-NOM the-manner-GEN
 "The one with good manners met me."
(b) atarim-u asan-a l-xuluq-i
 respect-I good-ACC the-manner-GEN
 "I respect the one with good manners."
Altakhaineh 11
(c) amal-u ma asan-i l-xuluq-i
 work-I with good-GEN the-manner-GEN
 "I work with the one with good manners."
Third, concerning the distributional equivalent criterion, the left element qawiyy "strong" is an adjective, while lbunyah "the
body" is a noun. The lexical category of the whole compound is a noun. This may suggest that the head is the right element,
which determines the syntactic category of the whole compound. However, Examples 44 and 45 may suggest that the adjective
qawiyy "strong," which is the left element, is nominalized:
(44) amal-u ma qawiyy l-bunyah
work-I with strong the-body
"I work with the one strong in body."
(45) taaddayt-u qawiyy l-bunyah
challenged.I strong the-body
"I challenged the one strong in body."
However, I would argue that the adjective qawiyy "strong" has not been nominalized; it remains an adjective, modifying a
silent noun. This argument is supported by Günther's (to appear) analysis of English and German data. Günther argues that the
adjectives in noun phrases such as the rich, the poor, the impossible, and so on have not been nominalized but are still adjec-
tives which modify an implicit noun.
Before discussing such implicit heads, Günther (to appear) points out a difference between phrases like the innocent, the
guilty, and the impossible, which have a default reading as referring to people or abstract concepts (called the "Human/Abstract
Construction" or "Nounless Noun Phrases"), as in Example 46, and ellipted noun phrases as in Example 47:
(46) Just as the innocent should not be punished, so the guilty should be made to pay.
(47)
The fact remains, however, that the challenger whose record is 19 wins and nine defeats has lost four of his last
six fights and six of his last eight.
(Günther to appear)
In Example 46, the noun phrases the innocent and the guilty do not have antecedents, but the ellipted noun phrase in
Example 47 does. To account for the presence versus the absence of an antecedent, Günther (to appear) assumes that in the
Human Construction, in Example 46, the silent noun, that is, one, has a generic personal reading, while in cases like Example
47, the silent noun refers to a specific person or entity.
In support of these ideas, Günther (to appear) provides counter-evidence against the nominalization analysis of the adjectives in
the rich, the poor, and so on. The first piece of evidence is that these adjectives are unable to carry plural markings as nouns normally
do, that is, *the riches, *the poors, and so on. The second piece of evidence is that these adjectives, in both English and German,
exhibit adjectival morphology, for example, comparative in Example 48 and superlative in Example 49 (Günther to appear):
(48) (a) . . . the wealthier have an obligation to help the weaker and the poorer.
(b) Die Reichen werden immer reicher, die Ärmeren immer ärmer.
 "The rich are constantly getting richer, the poorer are constantly getting 
poorer."
(49) (a) New aid to the poorest is given as grants, not loans.
(b) das Unglaublichste zu denken und das Unmöglichste für möglich zu halten
 "to think of the most unbelievable and to consider the most impossible to be possible"
Note that Günther does not mention the fact that the German adjectives have N case. I would suggest that N case is marked on
the adjective when the head noun is implicit (see Example 43 from Arabic). This part of the analysis is not developed by
Günther; thus, it requires further investigation.
12 SAGE Open
The third piece of evidence against the nominalization analysis of these adjectives is that the silent noun one in nounless
noun phrases in English can in fact be inserted into the construction, indicating that a nominal position must be available in the
structure (Günther to appear). Interestingly, if the silent noun one appears in the sentence, it agrees with the adjective in case,
number and gender in German and in number in English, that is, the innocent ones (Günther to appear).
Examining the Arabic compounds in line with Günther's (to appear) analysis shows that the lack of an antecedent discussed
by Günther (to appear) can also be observed in Examples 44 and 45, where the Adj + N compounds have a default reading
referring to a person.3 Similar to Günther's (to appear) examples from English and German, if the silent noun one/person
appears in Arabic, it normally has a generic reading, in the sense that it only refers to a human being without specifying who
he or she is. Note, however, that the context plays a role in identifying the intended referents. For instance, the poor in the
sentence I help the poor in my village does not have a generic reading. Similarly, the following sentence from Arabic does not
have a generic reading, as the context assigns a specific referent to the compound:
(50) raay-tu waasi-at-a l-aynayn ma sadiiq-i khalid
saw-I wide-F-ACC the-eyes with friend-my Khalid
"I saw the girl with wide eyes with my friend Khalid."
In addition, the silent noun agrees with the adjective in case, number, and gender, when it is pronounced, as in Example 51:
(51) (a) qaabalt-u axs-an tawiil-a l-qaamat-i
met-I person.MSG-ACC tall.MSG-ACC the-figure-GEN
 "I met a person with a tall figure."
(b) qaabalt-u aaaxs-an tawiil-i4 l-qaamat-i
 met-I person.MPL-ACC tall-MPL.ACC the-figure-GEN
 "I met people with tall figures."
(c) qaabalt-u fataat-an tawiil-at-a l-qaamat-i
met-I girl.FSG-ACC tall-FSG-ACC the-figure-GEN
 "I met a girl with a tall figure."
(e) qaabalt-u fatayaat-in tawiil-at-i5 l-qaamat-i
 met-I girl.FPL-ACC tall-FSG-ACC the-figure-GEN
 "I met girls with tall figures."
Example 51 shows that the implicit noun person/girl can be realized in Adj + N compounds in Arabic, and the adjective has to
agree with it. Note that adjectives in Arabic can carry the plural marker quite generally; thus, the plurality test is not applicable.
The other test of adjectivehood proposed by Günther (to appear), namely, exhibiting adjectival morphology, such as com-
parative and superlative, does not apply to the adjective in Adj + N compounds, as in the following examples:
(52) uibbu l-aqwa qalb-a-n min bayni aqraan-i
love.I the-strongest heart-ACC-INDF from among peers-my
"I love the bravest among my peers."
lit. I love the one strong in heart among my peers.
In particular, when we apply the comparative and superlative test to Adj + N compounds (see Example 52, a case of superlative
morphology), the structure of the compound changes. Specifically, the definite article is attached to the first element and the
second element is assigned as accusative case. Therefore, I will disregard this test.
All in all, it seems that Adj + N compounds in Arabic can be analyzed as being headed by an empty noun, that is, one/person,
and it is this noun that determines the syntactic category of the whole compound. Thus, the whole Adj + N compound is a noun on
the basis of the syntactic category of the implicit head. In addition, it seems as though the adjective, which is the first element in
Adj+ N compounds, acts on behalf of the implicit noun when it is not realized, bearing the case, number and gender markings.
The third syntactic criterion is obligatoriness of the head. The obligatory element is clearly the left element:
(53) (a) uibbu qawiyy l-bunyah
 love.I strong the-body
 "I love the strong and healthy person."
Altakhaineh 13
(b) uibbu l-qawiyy
 love.I the-strong
 "I love the strong person."
(c) *uibbu l-bunyah
 love.I the-body
 lit. I love the body.
Example 53b shows that the right element can be deleted, whereas Example 53c demonstrates that the left element cannot,
suggesting that the left element is the obligatory one.
With regard to the morphological criteria, first, it has already been established that the left element is the morphosyntactic
locus (see Example 51). Second, it is clear that the left element is lexical, whereas the second element is phrasal, because it
consists of the lexical items marked with the obligatory determiners l- "the" or -n "a/an," as in Examples 54 to 56:
(54) aziiz l-qawm
dear the-people
"the chief of people"
lit. the dear of people
(55) saiid l-aðð
happy the-luck
"the lucky person"
(56) daiif l-qalb
weak.MSG the-heart
"the cowardly male"
To sum up, the left element of the Adj + N compounds in Arabic is the implicit head one. Its absence seems to trigger case
marking on the adjective, a phenomenon that is also found in German.
The Implications of the Headedness Criteria
In the previous section, it was implicitly assumed that every compound has one single head, identified by all seven properties
simultaneously. However, there have been suggestions that there are different types of heads, identified by different properties.
Several scholars (e.g., Allen, 1978, p. 11; Bauer, 2009, p. 348; Lieber, 2010, p. 178; Scalise & Fábregas, 2010, p. 124; Scalise,
Fábregas, & Forza, 2009, pp. 49-50) have suggested that two main types of head, namely, semantic and syntactic heads, can be
distinguished. Here, it is worth pointing out that the seven criteria of headedness discussed in "Headedness Criteria in the
Previous Literature" section can also be used to identify types of head. For example, Haspelmath (2002, p. 88) argues that a
compound has a semantic head when the whole compound denotes a hyponym of either of its elements, such as sea bird, house-
boat, sailboat, school bus, handbag, and handbrake, where sea bird is a hyponym of bird and similarly for the other cases.
Concerning the syntactic head, Scalise et al. (2009) indicate that a compound has a "formal" head when (a) the head determines
the class of the whole compound, or (b) when the head carries all the inflectional markers, or (c) a combination of both. For
example, green is an adjective, but the syntactic category of the whole compound greenhouse is N, since the formal head is a N
(pp. 49-50). In the compound school buses, the head buses is inflected for number. Finally, in the compound blue skies, the
formal head skies determines the syntactic category of the whole compound and carries the plural suffix -s.
This approach is taken even further by Scalise and Fábregas (2010, p. 124), who discuss three types of head: (a) the syntac-
tic head, which determines the syntactic category of the whole compound (e.g., sky blue is an adjective like its syntactic head
blue); (b) the semantic head, which determines the semantic category (as in bookshop, which is a type of shop); and (c) the
inflectional head, which carries the inflectional markers (such as the plural -s in mother(s)-in-law). When dealing with the
semantic head, it is important to restate the difference between endocentric and exocentric compounds. Endocentric com-
pounds are semantically headed, such as sailboat which is a type of boat, while exocentric compounds are not semantically
headed, such as egghead which is not a hyponym of head (Booij, 2007, p. 81). In particular, the syntactic head is connected to
the distributional equivalence and subcategorization criteria, the semantic head is related to hyponymy, and the inflectional
head is a reflection of the morphosyntactic locus criterion. The normal expectation would be that all three types of head coin-
cide in one and the same element of the compound. This is certainly the case in English compounds like blackbird, where bird
is the semantic, syntactic, and inflectional head simultaneously; blackbird is a type of bird, it is a N like bird, and the plural is
14 SAGE Open
blackbirds. However, according to Arcodia (2012, p. 366), these types of head do not necessarily coincide, such as California
beauty and white collar (see Scalise & Fábregas, 2010, p. 125; Scalise et al., 2009, p. 61).
In Arabic, the semantic head in endocentric compounds is the left element, as exemplified by Example 57:
(57) minaar l-xaab
saw the-wood
"the wood saw"
The compound minaar lxaab "the wood saw" is a hyponym of minaar "saw"; thus, the head of the compound is minaar "saw."
However, the semantic relationship is not always clear in case of non-compositional compounds, as in the following example:
(58) bint l-ayn
daughter the-eye
"the tear"
In Example 58, bintlayn "the tear" is not a type of bint "daughter." As pointed out by Borer (2009), who discusses the notion
of semantic head in another Semitic language, that is, Hebrew, the "IS A" condition of Allen (1978, p. 11) cannot always be
applied. Although a phrase IS A modified version of its head, such a semantic connection does not always obtain in Hebrew
compounds; compare Examples 59 and 60, where Example 59 is a phrase, and Example 60 is a compound:
(59) (a) beyt mora IS A bayit
 house teacher IS A house
(b) somer mexoniyot IS A somer
 guard cars IS A guard
(60) (a) beyt sefer "school" IS NOT (necessarily) A bayit6
 house book "school" IS NOT (necessarily) A house
(b) yosev ros "chairman" IS NOT A yosev
 sitter head "chairman" IS NOT A sitter
Borer (2009) uses examples such as Example 60 to argue that some compounds in Hebrew are semantically headless. In particu-
lar, the whole compound is not a hyponym of either of its elements. Thus, looking at Example 58 from Arabic and Example
60from Hebrew, it seems that some compounds lack a semantic head. However, in the approach sketched above, they can still
have a syntactic and/or morphological head.
With respect to the syntactic head of a compound, it is the element that determines the syntactic category of the whole
compound (Scalise & Fábregas, 2010, p. 124). In Arabic, the left element is the syntactic head, as in Example 61:
(61) uubb-u qawiyy-at l-qalb
love-I strong-FSG the-heart
"I love the brave female."
lit. I love the one with the strong heart.
Example 61 shows that the implicit left element one is the syntactic head of the whole compound. The syntactic category
of the compound qawiyyat lqalb "the brave female one" is a noun like the implicit head one, not like the adjective qawiyyat
"strong."
Finally, Scalise and Fábregas (2010, 124) state that the morphological head carries the inflectional features of a word, such
as gender, number, and case. In Arabic, the element which carries the inflectional features, namely, number and gender is the
left element. This is illustrated with the following examples:
(62) (a) muallim l-kiimyaa
 teacher.MSG the-chemistry
 "the chemistry teacher"
Altakhaineh 15
(b) muallim-at l-kiimyaa
 teacher-FSG the-chemistry
 "the female chemistry teacher"
(c) muallim-uu l-kiimyaa
 teacher-MPL the-chemistry
 "the chemistry teachers"
(d) muallim-aat l-kiimyaa
 teacher-FPL the-chemistry
 "the female chemistry teachers"
The left element in Example 62 bears the inflectional markers of the compound as a whole and it is lexical rather than phrasal, as
discussed in "The Morphological Criteria" section. Thus, this section has shown that Arabic compounds exhibit three types of head,
that is, semantic, syntactic, and morphological, and these types always coincide in Arabic, unlike English.
Conclusion
Taking all the previous points into consideration, several
generalizations can be made with regard to headedness in
Arabic compounds within the SGC:
1. All N + N compounds are left-headed in accordance
with the semantic, syntactic, and morphological cri-
teria, supporting the generalization that Arabic is a
predominantly head-initial language.
2. The semantic, syntactic, and morphological heads
always coincide in Arabic compounds.
3. The most reliable test to determine the morphological
head in Arabic is the case test, which provides a bet-
ter test than number and gender.
4. In Adj + N compounds, a silent noun, that is,
one/person is responsible for determining the syntac-
tic category of the whole construct. This silent noun
is the head, which supports the generalization that
Arabic is a predominantly head-initial language.
This study has shown that the criteria used to identify the
head in syntactic constructs, for example, phrases proposed
by Zwicky (1985) and later developed by Bauer (1990),
have proven their validity in identifying heads in English
compounds (see Arcodia, 2012) and in Arabic compounds.
Based on these conclusions, it is recommended that further
studies which investigate the position of the head in other
types of compounds in Arabic, such as V + V compounds,
are needed to determine, first, whether all types of com-
pounds are headed and, second, whether they are all left-
headed or not.

Notes
1. Arabic refers to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).
2. The Construct State (referred to in Arabic as Idaafah) is
defined as a construct that normally consists of two nouns or
an adjective and a noun where the first element can be nomina-
tive, accusative or genitive based on the function of the whole
construct in the sentence, whereas the second element is always
genitive. Another important characteristic of the Construct
State is that the first element is always indefinite, whereas the
second can be definite or indefinite (see Fassi Fehri, 2012,
p. 156). In this study, however, I opted for the term Synthetic
Genitive Construction, which contrasts with "analytic geni-
tives," that is, with the possessive markers, for example, li "for/
of" in MSA. In fact, the "Construct State" refers to the mor-
phological form of the possessum in a construct, for example,
the lack of nunation and in some Arabic dialects, for example,
Jordanian Arabic, the feminine suffix surfacing with a final /t/,
and so on (see Altakhaineh 2016a, pp. 6-7).
3. Although the analysis provided by Günther (to appear) is
proposed to study phrases such as the rich, the poor, and so
on, I adopted her analysis to account for the missing head in
bahuvrihi compounds in MSA, since both structures share the
property of having an implicit head. A similar line of reason-
ing has been followed by other researchers (e.g., Arcodia,
2012; Bauer, 1990). In particular, some headedness criteria for
phrasehood have also been applied to identify the head in a
compound.
4. Originally, the adjective is tawiilin "tall (plural)," but the ­n
is deleted from the left element when it is followed by a noun.
16 SAGE Open
Note that -i is the case marking of both the accusative and the
genitive in masculine sound plural in Arabic.
5. The accusative case in the feminine sound plural in Arabic is
realized in the same way as the genitive with ­i.
6. Here, one may argue that bayit "house" is a building/place;
thus, it does have a semantic head. This case may require a
grammaticality judgment task by Hebrew speakers and is thus
not pursued here any further.
