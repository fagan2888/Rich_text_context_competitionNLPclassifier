A Fundamental Truth About
Developmental Disorders
A big turning point in my research was the realization
that the developmental disorders I studied, autism and
dyslexia, are lifelong conditions and should also be stud-
ied in adults. Twenty-five years ago, it was odd to see a
developmental psychologist recruit dyslexic and autistic
adults as participants in experiments. There were no
diagnostic instruments for adults at that time. Now that
we have these instruments, some deeper truths have
emerged: First, diagnosis based on behavioral criteria will
always be problematic, as behavior is strongly influenced
by comorbidity, motivation, age, and ability. Second,
compensatory learning can circumvent or cover up, but
not eliminate, some basic difficulties in cognitive pro-
cessing. Third, comorbidity and low general ability tend
to reduce opportunities for compensation.
Twenty-five years ago, it became apparent that many
dyslexic adults had learned to read accurately and could
achieve an acceptable reading age. Later, it also became
apparent that, in Italy, dyslexic children read perfectly
accurately. This success is due to the transparent and
regular Italian writing system, which I have suggested
can act as a therapeutic environment for dyslexia
(U. Frith, 1999). However, we were able to demonstrate
the presence of dyslexia in Italy and the persistence of
reading problems in dyslexic adults using measures of
reading speed and tests designed to tap phonological
processing. These measures revealed underlying neuro-
cognitive problems, indicating that they are universal,
regardless of language, and persistent, regardless of com-
pensatory learning (Paulesu et al., 2001).
In the case of autism, the huge range of clinical mani-
festations is a major problem. This can be observed not
only by comparing different individuals, but also by trac-
ing changes during the lifetime of a single individual.
Thus, since the 1980s, it has been known that some indi-
viduals start off being aloof and withdrawn and later
become socially active but odd. Repetitive behaviors
often lessen with age; special interests can vanish and
savant talents can change. It is still not clear what causes
these changes and wide variations, but comorbidity
increases severity whereas compensation makes it possi-
ble to disguise persisting problems (U. Frith, 2008).
Adults with dyslexia and adults with autism who show
good compensation can sail through standard diagnostic
tests. Have they ceased to be dyslexic or autistic? Of
course not. They themselves tell us about their persisting
problems, and we can reveal these problems with more
subtle tests. We now know that dyslexics read well at a
cost of time and effort. The same is true for autistic peo-
ple. They can use well-rehearsed social scripts that work

Abstract
Autism and dyslexia are wrongly classified as childhood disorders: They are lifelong and therefore have to be studied
in adults as well as in children. Individual variability is enormous, and, as a result, behavioral diagnosis remains
problematic. The study of the underlying cognitive abilities in autism and dyslexia has acted as a gateway for the
emergence of developmental cognitive neuroscience.

in familiar situations. However, stress and unfamiliar situ-
ations can produce catastrophic collapse. To visualize the
differences between surface behavior and underlying
cognitive mechanisms, I have found it useful to apply a
framework representing three levels of explanation:
behavior, cognition, and brain (U. Frith, 2001). These do
not map onto each other in one-to-one fashion. Rather, a
large number of biological risk factors may lead to diffi-
culties in a few specific cognitive processes. These few
difficulties in turn may give rise to a large number of
behavioral signs and symptoms (U. Frith, 2012).
A Fundamental Change in Methods:
Looking Inside the Brain/Mind
It is a little known fact that the development of diagnostic
tests for adults gained impetus from the desire to make
use of the emerging neuroimaging techniques. This
advance occurred because it seemed wrong to scan chil-
dren. In fact, when we scanned the first dyslexic adults in
the mid 1990s, we had known them from when they had
been first diagnosed as children. The same was true for
the first autistic adults. The diagnostic tests now available
have been a great boon in many ways, but especially for
those people who had slipped through the net and were
not diagnosed as children. They had unjustly been
labeled slow, lazy, or unintelligent. Having a name for
your problems and learning that there are others like you
can be liberating.
It is remarkable how quickly research on disorders of
cognitive development has transformed into cognitive
developmental neuroscience. This advance was due to
the generous collaboration of researchers who pioneered
neuroimaging methods and volunteers who braved the
still novel scanners. In those heady days, we naively
hoped that we would be able to immediately identify the
malfunctioning brain circuit that gave rise to critical dif-
ficulties in cognitive processing, such as difficulty in pho-
nological processing in dyslexia or difficulty in social
processing in autism. Things turned out to be far more
complex, particularly as we are still largely ignorant of
how the brain works. Which brain circuits are necessary
for distinct cognitive processing mechanisms? How do
they function in neurotypical brains? We had, and still
have, a lot to learn.
Today, when researchers have reassured themselves
that MRI methods are safe also for children, the field is
changing again. There are now several longitudinal stud-
ies in progress in which individuals are scanned repeat-
edly over many years. This work is giving us information
about the developing brain and mind that we simply
never had before. For instance, there is a dramatic wax-
ing and waning restructuring of gray and white matter
throughout childhood and adolescence. This work should
get us closer to understand which cognitive processes
might go wrong in neurodevelopmental disorders and
when.
The Rise and Fall of Asperger
Syndrome
Autism has always been with us, but it has been recog-
nized only since the mid 20th century, and then only very
slowly. The prevalence is now thought to be around 1%,
which is a staggering increase from the 0.1% estimate
from 25 years ago. One major reason for the increase is
the widening of the diagnostic criteria (U. Frith, 2008)--
the spectrum of autism is now incredibly broad. At one
extreme is the individual who does not use speech and
has severely repetitive and restricted behaviors; at the
other extreme is the individual with Asperger syndrome
who is highly articulate and has superior analytic abilities
and fascinating special interests. Despite these differ-
ences, there is a common denominator: a highly recog-
nizable lack of reciprocal social interaction. Even the
very able individual on the milder part of the autism
spectrum cannot compensate for a peculiar void in social
interaction: engaging in the ordinary to and fro of every-
day human communication (Frith, 2004).
The widespread public recognition of Asperger syn-
drome was impossible to foresee when I translated
Asperger's landmark paper (U. Frith, 1991) at a time
when most people had never heard of the name. But the
rise over the last 20 years may now be followed by a
fall--the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders has abandoned the label. It
was removed because it is widely agreed that the critical
features distinguishing Asperger syndrome from other
neurodevelopmental disorders are the same as those
seen in autism. In addition, there is a largely unrecog-
nized downside to the rise of Asperger syndrome:
Researchers have become less interested in studying
those who are intellectually disabled. These individuals
are much more difficult to study. Yet they have so much
to tell us, if we only knew the right questions to ask.
Mechanisms of Social Cognition
Autism provided the inspiration for the idea that social
information might be processed differently from other
information and given priority in neurotypical minds
(U. Frith & Frith, 1999). Of course, we still don't know
what the processes are like and how the prioritizing
works. Autism throws the spotlight on social communica-
tion, and furthermore, it reverses the tables: What is
it that makes us insatiable in our craving for social
communication?
Many different mechanisms in our mind are dedicated
to processing social stimuli (C. Frith & Frith, 2012). One
of these, known as Theory of Mind, or mentalizing,
672 Frith
entered psychologist's jargon as shorthand for the ten-
dency to attribute mental states to each other. Amazingly,
this tendency has a circumscribed basis in the brain
(U. Frith & Frith, 1999) and has been operationalized by
tasks such as the Sally-Ann test. In this test, children
above the age of 4 can attribute a false belief to Sally, but
autistic children cannot do so. However, it turned out that
this is not the whole story--able autistic adolescents and
adults can pass the Sally-Ann test and similar tasks.
There is also a nonverbal type of intuitive mentalizing,
which can be assessed via eye gaze patterns, and here
we get a different story: Even young infants engage in
this intuitive mentalizing, but able autistic adults do not
(Senju, Southgate, White, & Frith, 2009). Perhaps this is
why they struggle with everyday fast moving reciprocal
communication even when they have learned to attribute
mental states explicitly (U. Frith, 2012). Many questions
are now being raised about mentalizing and its likely
presence in other species, such as birds and dolphins.
What is uniquely human in social communication? Why
have only humans invented governments and schools,
and how do they manage their reputation in the age of
the World Wide Web (Tennie, Frith, & Frith, 2010)? So
much remains to be explored in the next 25 years.
