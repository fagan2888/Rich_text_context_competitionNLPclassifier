Spousal communication about the risk of
contracting HIV/AIDS in rural Malawi

Abstract
This paper uses qualitative and quantitative data from married men and women in rural
Malawi to examine how they comprehend their risk to HIV/AIDS and what preventive
strategies they consider within marriage. Program efforts to promote behavior change have
consistently focused on promoting chastity before marriage and fidelity while married or
using condoms. These behavioral prescriptions are suitable for extramarital contexts but
not within marriage, where the condom is far from being accepted as a suitable preventive
tool and spouses face the reality that one's vulnerability to AIDS is not confined to his/her
behavior alone. The survey data show, unsurprisingly, that those who have the most reason
for concern (e.g. those worried about contracting the disease) and those who have greater
program and informal social contacts are most likely to communicate. The semi-structured
interviews show that husbands and wives use subtle and gendered strategies to encourage
fidelity; they talk to each other about the consequences of HIV/AIDS on their children's
and their own lives as a prelude for highlighting and justifying joint sexual prudence. These
results show that rather than giving up to fate, marital partners are actively challenging and
persuading each other to reform sexual behavior to avoid the intrusion of HIV/AIDS into
the home.

1. Introduction
HIV/AIDS prevention programs in sub-Saharan Africa began with efforts to reach marginal
and high-risk groups such as truck drivers and commercial sex workers. Once the epidemic
went beyond such core groups to become generalized, many new infections are likely to
take place through ordinary conjugal relations. Yet even today in countries with high
prevalence of HIV, married couples are rarely the primary targets of HIV prevention
programs. Most preventive strategies emphasize abstaining from sex or using condoms,
strategies that are appropriate for individuals to avoid infection outside marriage but are not
perceived by couples to be appropriate within marriage. How, then, do married couples
attempt to protect themselves from infection by their spouse? One potential strategy is to
initiate a discussion of the threat of AIDS in order to persuade the spouse to be faithful.
This may be difficult: a number of studies have documented the difficulties that both men
and women perceive in raising the topics of infidelity and of condom use within marriage
(Fapohunda and Rutenberg 1999, Blanc et al. 1996, Knodel and Pramualratana 1996). Yet
spousal communication may be an effective means of protection from HIV/AIDS among
married people.
Much more research has been done on the relationship between spousal
communication and use of family planning than sexual behavior relating to HIV/AIDS.
Studies on spousal communication and family planning typically show a strong positive
correlation between spousal communication and contraceptive use: women who report
using family planning are more likely to report that they have discussed family planning
with their spouse than women who do not report such use (Dodoo 1998, Ezeh 1993,
Fapohunda and Rutenberg 1999, Isiugo-Abanihe 1994; Lasee and Becker 1997). A recent
study using longitudinal data from Northern Ghana demonstrates that spousal
communication predicts contraceptive use (Bawah 2002). Given that spousal
communication is so key for adoption of contraception, there is need to understand not only
the effect of communication on contraceptive use in various contexts, but also the largely
ignored impact of various factors on spousal communication on such reproductive health
issues. This is important particularly for IEC programs that may need to encourage spousal
communication for adoption of positive reproductive health innovations.
The positive relationship between spousal communication and contraceptive use
suggests the potential importance of spousal communication in AIDS prevention. A few
studies have examined and shown a positive relationship between partner communication
and adoption of condoms among adolescents as well as adults (see, for example, Shoop and
Davidson 1994; Rickman et al. 1994; DiClemente 1991; Zamboni, Crawford and Williams
2000). Survey data from Uganda show that men who have discussed HIV prevention with
their wives are more likely to have used condoms at last sexual intercourse, although the
impact of spousal communication about AIDS diminishes significantly among those who
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 249
also discussed use of family planning with their wives (Gage and Ali 2003). Although
spousal communication is positively associated with having an HIV-test, the Uganda data
do not conclusively show a significant positive relationship between spousal talk and
condom use as well as fidelity. So, while further work is needed to establish whether there
is actually a causal linkage between spousal communication and adoption of preventive
sexual behaviors, these studies are suggestive that spousal communication can indeed
promote adoption of protective sexual behaviors.
Rather than focus on the relationship between spousal communication and
reproductive behavior (as done by most studies on family planning), this study uses
quantitative data to examine factors that facilitate husband-wife communication about the
risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Additionally, the study goes beyond the survey data and
quantitative analysis that many past studies on spousal communication have utilized (for
an exception, see Blanc et al. 1996) to analyze what husbands and wives actually say to
each other when they talk about their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. The quantitative
findings on factors that influence whether or not a conversation about AIDS occurred are
compared with qualitative reports of contexts under which spousal conversations take
place. The content of conversations between husbands and wives is valuable in clarifying
how couples in rural Malawi comprehend and express their fears and risk to HIV/AIDS and
what strategies they are exploring to prevent the intrusion of AIDS into the home.
It should also be noted that husbands and wives might use non-verbal forms of
communication (Dodoo, Ezeh and Owour, 2001; Blanc et al. 1996). Thus, when one
spouse perceives a need but the other does not, the topic may not be broached because the
other spouse is believed ­ perhaps correctly - to oppose the issue being considered.
Husbands and wives may also avoid direct verbal communication if one or both of them
perceive that the topic of HIV prevention is so sensitive that to broach it would threaten the
tranquility of the marriage. Indeed, a number of options exist for couples beyond talking
about the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS when one of them feels that the other is
endangering his/her life by indulging in extramarital affairs. One sometimes adopted by
women, is to discourage the "other woman" by harassing her - by going to her home and
asking "Is my husband there?" or even physically assaulting her (Schatz 2002). The
aggrieved person may also report the matter to the marriage counselor or elderly members
of the extended family to intervene, and in extreme cases, resort to divorce. Discussions
within marriage and ultimately involving the extended family, however, are less drastic. It
is also more consistent with the local view of married life, which acknowledges that there
will be disagreements in the home but holds that disagreements should be resolved
amicably through "discussion" or, if that fails, through the mediation of relatives.
As in other countries of sub-Saharan Africa where the AIDS epidemic has become
generalized, married husbands and wives are the largest sexually active group at risk of
infection from HIV in Malawi. Our data show that the vast majority of rural husbands and
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
250 http://www.demographic-research.org
wives understand that AIDS is a threat to their lives, and that many perceive, correctly, that
their fates are joined--that they are at risk from their spouse. It is widely believed that if
one spouse becomes infected, the other one will probably be infected as well. Infection is
understood to be equivalent to death, since it is known that there is no cure for AIDS. Both
wives and husbands believe that regular sex is a central aspect of marriage; both also
believe that men and women (particularly men) may seek extramarital partners, which are
perceived to be the vectors through which AIDS reaches the bedroom. The irony of this
perception is that there is also a widespread belief in Malawi and many other African
countries that a single person is at a higher risk of HIV infection than a married person
since the former is more likely to be involved with multiple sexual partners. Consequently,
single people are urged and even pressured to get married in order to reduce their risk of
contracting HIV/AIDS. However, simulation of HIV-infection rates among newly married
people in Malawi show that HIV infection is already present in 13-20 percent of the
couples (Bracher, Santow and Watkins Forthcoming). Although young women are more
likely to be HIV positive than men of the same age, the study shows that marriage puts
women at a greater risk of HIV infection than men since only around 2% of the brides are
estimated to be HIV-positive at the time of marriage Considering the central place of sex
within marriage, and the realization that married people may indulge in extra-marital
affairs, it is important to understand how husbands and wives express their fears against
AIDS, and how they attempt to protect themselves.
We begin in Section 2 with a discussion of the data we use, which come from a
household survey conducted in 1998 and semi-structured interviews conducted in 1999. In
Section 3 we briefly describe the context in which the data were collected. In Section 4 we
use household survey data to analyze the correlates of spousal conversations about AIDS.
We examine whether characteristics of the couple, indicators of risk to infection, and access
to both formal and informal sources of information on AIDS are associated with whether
or not they report having had a discussion with their spouse. In Section 5 we use qualitative
data to examine the content, structure and themes of spousal discussion. Our conclusions
follow in Section 6.
2. Data and methods
This study uses data from the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP),
which involves longitudinal interviews with wives and husbands in three regions of rural
Malawi. The project examines the roles of social interactions in the acceptance (or
rejection) of modern contraceptive methods and of smaller ideal family size and the
diffusion of knowledge about AIDS transmission and acceptable preventive strategies.
A household survey was conducted in 1998 (we call this survey Malawi 1, as it was
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 251
followed by re-interviews of these respondents in 2001, which we call Malawi 2)
Eligible respondents were ever-married women aged between 15 and 49 years and
their husbands. In 1999, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a randomly chosen
sub-sample of the 1998 survey respondents. This study uses the 1998 survey data
and the 1999 qualitative data. The project is described in detail on:
http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/Social_Networks/ and in Watkins et al. (2003).
2.1 Quantitative Data
The 1998 survey interviewed 1541 ever-married women of childbearing age (15-49) and
1065 men (husbands of the currently married women) in three rural districts in Malawi:
Rumphi in the Northern Region, Mchinji in the Central Region, and Balaka in the Southern
Region. All of the areas are poor, with little in the way of development: roads are poor and
electricity is largely confined to nearby towns. The three regions are, however, quite
different in some aspects: the South is predominantly matrilineal and matrilocal, the North
is predominantly patrilineal and patrilocal, and the Center is mixed (historically matrilineal
and matrilocal, but over the last century it has been shifting to patrilineal and patrilocal
(Zulu 1996). These differences may imply regional differences in gender systems that may
be relevant for the woman's autonomy and consequent role in spousal communication. For
example, where land, the basic economic resource, is passed through the maternal line, it
is expected that wives would have more autonomy than where inheritance is through the
husband (Caldwell and Caldwell 1990).
The final sample size for husbands was smaller than for wives primarily because some
of the husbands were not present at the time of the survey, usually because they were
working, doing business elsewhere or attending funerals. Because some wives were away
as well, we were only able to interview 812 couples in the 1998 survey, of which 706
identified themselves as monogamous (that there was no other wife in the relationship),
while the rest of the couples gave discrepant responses on the type of marital union they
were in. The quantitative analysis is restricted to the 706 couples where both the husband
and the wife reported that they were in a monogamous marriage to avoid the uncertainty
of not knowing which wife the husband was referring to when answering questions about
the spouse. The sizable percentage of couples that gave discrepant responses on the type
of marital union (13%), however, suggests that there are either a substantial number of
unions with hidden relationships or differential understanding of the meaning of polygamy.
The restriction of the quantitative analysis to couples where both reported monogamous
status, thus, potentially under represents couples in which there is high chance of infidelity
and perhaps a greater chance of discussion if, as the qualitative data show, most spousal
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
252 http://www.demographic-research.org
discussions about HIV/AIDS risk come about following suspicions or knowledge about a
spouse's infidelity.
During the survey, respondents were asked, "Have you ever talked with your spouse
about the chances that you or she/he might get infected with AIDS?" A study examining
husband-wife discordance in various issues using the 1998 survey data has shown that
husbands and wives sometimes do not agree in answers to a range of questions where they
would be expected to give similar responses (Miller, Zulu and Watkins 2001). These
discrepancies were observed not only in spousal discussions about AIDS, number of
children to have and use of family planning, but also on responses referring to ownership
of various household goods. These discrepancies, also observed in the Malawi and Kenya
Demographic and Health surveys, were systematic and gendered, in that when couples
differed in their responses, husbands were more likely to respond in the affirmative than
wives. The discrepancies were particularly large with respect to spousal conversations:
30%, 35%, and 37% of the monogamously married couples gave discordant responses on
the occurrence of conversations on family planning, AIDS, and desired number of children,
respectively (Table 1). Given this discordance, it would not be appropriate to use the
husband or the wife's response alone in analyzing couple communication on such issues.
These patterns also highlight the need to understand determinants of discordance in
reporting spousal communication. In order to take account of the couple discordance, we
use multinomial logistic regression to simultaneously examine factors that influence
whether husbands and wives talk about their risk of AIDS or not, and whether they agree
about the occurrence of such a discussion. The factors that we expect to be associated with
the likelihood that spouses report talking about the risk of contracting AIDS, based on the
analysis of the qualitative data in section 5, are in three categories: stimulus factors, risk
factors, and couple characteristics.
Stimulus factors: These are indicators of the extent to which the respondents have
been exposed to information about HIV/AIDS from program sources (such as hearing
messages from radios, health clinics, and community based health workers) as well as
informal social networks (such as the number of people respondents have discussed AIDS
with, and the number of people they know who they think died of AIDS or have AIDS).
Since discussion of community experiences with HIV/AIDS mostly travels through
informal social networks, we use the number of people respondents have talked to and the
number of people they know who they think have died of AIDS as a general indicator of
exposure to informal sources of information for the respondent. Our expectation is that
couples that have been exposed to more information (whether formal or informal) would
be more likely to talk with each other about AIDS than couples that have less exposure. In
the analysis we combine the husband and the wife's responses about exposure to formal

sources of information (radio, health clinics, and community health workers). We have a
series of four-category variables distinguishing: 1) where both the husband and the wife
acquired information from the source, 2) where only the wife acquired information from
the source, 3) where only the husband acquired information from the source, and 4) where
neither acquired information from the source. Men and women's network measures have
been included in the analysis separately because they differ remarkably.
Risk factors: These are factors that increase/decrease the need for a discussion, based
on the extent of perceived risk of AIDS faced by the couple (for instance, whether at least
one spouse suspects the other of infidelity or the extent of worry about the likelihood of
contracting the disease). We also include correct knowledge of the fact that a person can
contract the HIV virus from a healthy-looking person as a general measure of the
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
254 http://www.demographic-research.org
comprehension of the disease and associated risk. The expectation is that the greater the
extent of perceived risk, the more likely the couple is to have discussed their joint risk.
Marital Relationship Factors: The third category of factors reflects characteristics of
the couple that may hinder or facilitate discussion. The expectation here is that couples that
freely discuss other issues (like family planning) and share information about other aspects
of their lives (such as income made) should be more predisposed to talk, given that there
is need for them to do so. Additionally, couples that are socially close (small age
difference) or more educated may be more likely to discuss the risk of HIV/AIDS and other
issues.
2.2 Qualitative Data
In 1999 we carried out semi-structured interviews with randomly selected wives and
husbands (from the 1998 survey respondents) in order to understand what they say to each
other when they talk about their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Such interviews are the only
practical way to learn about the content of their conversations. The sample was determined
by estimating the sample size that would be sufficient to provide variation across
respondents that was similar to the variation in the 1998 survey, guided by the distribution
of relevant responses to attitudinal questions about family planning in the survey. Taking
the pronounced differences in responses in the 1998 survey, we estimated that we would
need a sample of at least 20 wives and 20 husbands in each of the three regions. Based on
the non-response experience of the 1998 survey, we selected a large enough sample to end
up with around 25 male and 25 female interviews in each region. In the South, we selected
38 women and 41 husbands, of whom 23 and 28, respectively, were interviewed. In the
Center we interviewed 26 women and 27 men from a selected sample of 37 women and 37
men. In the North, the sample consisted of 41 men and 41 women, of whom we
interviewed 27 women and 25 men. Thus, in the three areas, we interviewed a total of 80
men and 76 women.
The interviewers were the best of the local interviewers who had participated in the
1998 survey; they were thus familiar with the overall emphasis of the project on informal
conversational interactions. In order to encourage the interviewers to shift from the
structured approach of the 1998 survey to a more conversational approach in these
interviews, they were given a guide that listed the four major areas (family size, family
planning, HIV/AIDS and characteristics of network partners) that we covered in the
interviews, with a small set of questions in each area that we were interested in addressing.
For each issue, we asked the respondents what people in the communities say about these
issues and went on to ask about the last conversation that they had on the issue. We also
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 255
asked specifically if they had ever had a discussion on the topic with their spouse, and
asked for details about the last conversation. For HIV/AIDS we asked the respondents how
people tell who might be infected, what people say about their worries about contracting
the disease, and details about the last conversation with their spouse. In training, we first
concentrated on explaining the rationale for each of the four areas, and we emphasized that
as much as possible the interviewers should try to get who-said-what-to whom, rather than
just a summary of the conversations. The transcripts show that the interviewers did
understand the issues; although the discussions may be shorter as reported than they were,
in fact there is a sense of conversations both between the interviewers and the respondents
and between the husband and the wife.
The more informal approach taken in these interviews means that respondents'
answers were more spontaneous, and thus perhaps more valid. A disadvantage, however,
is that the informal approach means that we do not have equivalent information for all
respondents. For example, below we note how many respondents' recall a conversation
with their spouse about AIDS mentioned the danger of children becoming orphans if the
parents were infected and died, and how many respondents did not mention children in this
context. Because the respondents remembered the conversation as including children, we
interpret these answers as representing the importance of children in spousal discussions
of AIDS. For respondents who did not mention children in the last conversation, however,
it may be that children were indeed less important during that conversation, although it is
possible that they had referred to children in other conversations that took place prior to the
last one.
The interviews were conducted in the mother-tongue of the respondent, and usually
transcribed and translated by the interviewer. An a priori coding scheme was developed,
and the interviews were coded in NUD*IST. Additionally, we conducted special coding
for this paper to depict the salience of the key themes coming out of the interviews. The
coding permitted us to describe typical responses as well as to indicate diversity. In the
analysis of the semi-structured interviews that follows, we use quotations that in our
opinion best illustrate the perceptions of respondents in their approach to communication
with their spouse, and the content of their conversations. Our interpretation of both the
quantitative and the qualitative data are aided by three separate projects directed by
members of the research team in one or more of the same sites: interviews with parents of
our respondents (Kaler 2001), interviews with respondents from the 1998 survey about
marriage (Schatz 2002), and about sexual partnerships (Tawfik 2002).

3. Study context
In rural Malawi, HIV/AIDS is widely recognized as a new disease, one that was not there
before, and as the most serious disease confronting society. When asked which disease is
considered most serious, close to two-thirds of the qualitative interviewees mentioned
HIV/AIDS. Many also recognize the need for innovations in sexual behavior to protect
them from this new disease. Since the levels of public and private discussion of
innovations are believed to be related (Caldwell 2000) it is useful to briefly summarize
public activities in relation to AIDS in Malawi.
Malawi has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS infection in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The first cases of AIDS were officially acknowledged in 1985 (Chirwa 1998), and the
current HIV prevalence of 15% of adults is among the highest in the World
(www.unaids.org). As in most sub-Saharan African countries, the government was slow to
acknowledge the extent of the potential threat or to take visible action (Caldwell 2000).
Blood screening began early, but it was only in 1989 that the government began to
implement a World Bank Medium Term Plan, considered the first evidence of the
government's commitment to AIDS prevention. Program efforts to promote behavior
change have consistently portrayed AIDS as spread by extramarital and premarital sex, with
the solution being chastity before marriage and fidelity after. Consequently, Information,
Education, and Communication (IEC) campaigns have been intensified throughout the
country to educate people about the virtues of chastity and fidelity to avoid HIV/AIDS
infection. Most of the AIDS posters we saw in local clinics focused on warning against
extramarital sex to prevent AIDS. There is also considerable advertising of condoms
associated with programs on social marketing of condoms by Banja La Mtsogolo, a local
franchise of Marie Stopes that began in 1991 and by Population Services International
(PSI) that began in 1994.
The link between public activities and private discussion is probably weak for
HIV/AIDS, since the rapid spread of HIV has been accompanied by an increase in deaths
that would occasion comment even in the absence of public discussion. It is thus, not
surprising that most of the respondents in the 1998 survey reported having discussed AIDS
with others in their social networks: only 16% of women and 7% of men said they had not
had such discussions. Funerals are frequent­about half the 1998 survey respondents had
been to 1-4 funerals in the previous month, and about half had been to more than four. The
vast majority of the respondents (83% of women and 72% of men) were either moderately
or very worried about getting AIDS. Further analysis of factors that influence whether a
person is worried about the disease or not show that perception of one's fidelity is one of
the most significant determinants of worry (Smith forthcoming). Respondents are very
aware of the risk posed by the behavior of their spouse. When those who said they had a
high risk of being infected were asked how they thought they were most likely to get
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 257
infected, 80% of women and 79% of men answered that it was through heterosexual sex,
either with another partner or with a spouse who had been infected by another partner. The
majority of the survey respondents believe that AIDS is highly infectious, such that if one
spouse is infected the other will also be infected. In the 2001 survey, 64% of female and
68% of male respondents reported that infection is certain if one has sex once with an
infected person (Smith Forthcoming). When asked whether divorce is appropriate if a
spouse is believed to have AIDS, the majority (84% of men as well as women in 1998) said
it was not, often explaining that: "if the spouse has it you have it too, so what's the point
of leaving?" However, the majority of the respondents (94% of men and 68% of women)
reported that it is appropriate to divorce a spouse if she/he is unfaithful.
In summary, conversations about AIDS both in informal networks outside the family
and with a spouse suggest that our respondents perceived the issue as important.
4. Results: Correlates of spousal discussion of HIV/AIDS
Table 2 shows multinomial logistic regression results for the analysis of determinants of
spousal communication about AIDS. The reference category for the dependent variable
is "both said they did not talk". Because the interpretation of the parameter estimates in
a multinomial logit regression is not straightforward, the same results are presented in Table
3 as estimated probabilities that a man/woman in a given couple would fall in any of the
three categories of the dependent variable. The probabilities are calculated for each
covariate, while holding the remaining factors at their mean values.
The results highlight the importance of both formal and informal sources of
information in influencing spousal discussion of the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.
Couples where both the husband and wife have accessed information about AIDS from
clinics and those who interact with more people are associated with significantly higher
probabilities of talking about their risk relative to those with less exposure to such
information. The big difference in spousal communication among couples where both
accessed information about the disease from clinics and where only one of them did
suggests that husbands and wives individualize such information. Couples where the wife
talked with more than five people about HIV/AIDS are significantly more likely to disagree
that a conversation took place (probability of 0.145) than among couples where the wife
talked to less people. This suggests that talking to many "outside" people about HIV/AIDS
may influence some respondents to say they talked with their spouse, even when the
conversation did not take place.
The quantitative results are also consistent with the hypothesis that spousal discussion
of the joint risk of contracting HIV/AIDS is significantly promoted by the extent of worry
about contracting the disease. The likelihood of discussing the risk of contracting
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
258 http://www.demographic-research.org
HIV/AIDS is highest when both spouses are very worried (as opposed to being slightly
worried or not worried at all) about contracting the disease. When only the wife is worried,
the likelihood of spousal discussion about HIV/AIDS is not significantly different from
cases where both are worried. However, when only the husband is worried about the
disease, the probability of discussing the joint risk to HIV/AIDS is significantly lower than
when both are worried. This is in line with the qualitative data that show that discussions
about the joint risk of contracting the disease are initiated by women, and usually when they
are worried or suspicious that the husband is having an affair. It should be noted,
nevertheless, that a spouse's perception of risk can also be influenced by the spousal
discussion itself, which raises a potential problem of endogeneity. As the qualitative data
(presented in section 5) show, some respondents appear to indicate that their perception of
the disease and sexual behavior reformed following conversations with their spouses.
However, the variable is included in this analysis because the vast majority of the
transcripts show that worrying about being infected, which is mostly influenced by the
spouse's knowledge or suspicion of the partner's infidelity, is the key factor that pushes
spouses to talk about their personal and joint risk of HIV/AIDS infection. The wife's
correct knowledge that a person can contract the HIV virus from a healthy looking person
is associated with higher probabilities of spousal communication. Considering that most
men who have extra-marital affairs do so with "healthy-looking women", wives who think
that a healthy-looking person can not transmit the HIV virus would be less worried about
the husband's extramarital liaisons and, consequently, less likely to initiate a discussion
about the need to take precautionary measures.
Most of the couple-characteristic variables that we examined (e.g. education, age gap
between spouses, sharing information on income, etc) did not have a significant impact on
spousal communication about the joint risk to HIV/AIDS. Couples where both the
husband and the wife said they have never talked about family planning, however, exhibited
the highest probability (0.16) of both of them saying they have never talked about
HIV/AIDS, implying that some couples are simply not predisposed to discuss such
reproductive health issues.
The Z-score ranking of the most important determinants of spousal communication
(included in the model) about the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS are the size of the woman's
informal social network, accessing information about the disease from clinics, and whether
the couple have also discussed use of family planning or not, followed by the husband's
social network, women's correct knowledge that one can contract HIV/AIDS from a
healthy-looking sexual partner, and the extent of worrying about contracting the disease.
Region of residence was included in the model to check whether there were contextual
differences in the extent of spousal communications about HIV/AIDS. The results show
that couples in the Center are significantly more likely to discuss the risk of HIV/AIDS than
couples in the North and South, while there was no significant difference between those in
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 259
the South and the North. The Center follows a mixed kinship and lineage system, while the
North is predominantly patrilineal/patrilocal and the South is predominantly
matrilineal/matrilocal, which suggests that spousal communications on HIV/AIDS may be
influenced by lineage systems and associated differences on female autonomy and status.
In the analysis of spousal discordance on various survey questions using the same data, it
was found that spousal differences on family planning and AIDS conversations were
statistically significant in the Center and the South, but not in the North (Miller, Zulu and
Watkins 2001). Given that one of the key differences across the three areas is that the
North has higher levels of women's status as measured by levels of education and freedom
of movement (Schatz 2002), the study suggested that women's status could be positively
associated with spousal agreement. It is not clear what aspects of the contextual differences
actually affect spousal communication.
The results for spousal disagreement are not as consistent and clear-cut as the ones
distinguishing couples where both reported either that a conversation took place or did not
take place. Couples where the wife has more network partners and the ones where the wife
correctly knows that one can contract the disease from a healthy-looking person increased
the likelihood of discordance while cases where the husband was worried about contracting
the disease significantly reduced the likelihood of discordance.

5. Content of spousal conversations about HIV/AIDS
In what follows, we use semi-structured interviews to describe the content of spousal
communication on AIDS in our study communities. We emphasize that we were not able
to overhear conversations as they actually occurred: we only have access to what the
respondents chose to tell us about them. Many conversations are reported in "he said, she
said" format, giving the impression of a real conversation. They appear, however, to have
been brief and somewhat laconic. This may adequately reflect the actual conversations.
On the other hand, spousal conversations are clearly private: almost all respondents said
that they occurred when the husband and wife were alone, and respondents­perhaps some
more than others­may have wished to protect this privacy by being brief about what they
discussed.
In presenting the results, we identify respondents by region (S=SOUTH, C=CENTER,
and N=NORTH), gender (M=male, F=female) and ID number. The interactions between
interviewers and respondents include many repetitions and murmurs (e.g. "Mmm", "Eeeh");
we include these as they give a sense of the conversational flow. There are evident gender
differences in some aspects of respondents' approaches to spousal conversation, and we
comment on these. We did not detect regional differences, but since region was significant
in the preceding analysis of correlates of spousal discussions, we provide such identifying
information as well. The lack of regional differences in the content of spousal conversations
suggests that despite the structural differences (in kinship, residence, and religion, etc.)
across the three regions, husbands and wives use the same conversational strategies and
raise similar issues when they discuss their joint risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.
5.1 Joint fates
Overall, it is evident that both spouses perceive their fates to be joined: that if one becomes
infected, the other will also be (see, also Schatz 2002, Tawfik 2002). The word "move"
used below is one of a set of terms (moving, movements, "movious", walking) that are
often used to refer to sex outside marriage:
I: What made you talk about AIDS? R: We saw a certain woman from our village,
then my wife started warning me that `my husband, these days do not move anyhow,
because the times are bad, if you catch this disease then I will automatically catch
it too, then our children would be orphans when we die' (N-M-04)
Over and over again, both husbands and wives emphasize that it is not enough for one
spouse to take precautions against infection with HIV but that both of them must do it.
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 263
I: So did you speak with your wife about the dangers of the world, that there is
AIDS? R: Yes. I have. I: So, what made you speak with your wife? R: Because we
see how people die of AIDS, and how dangerous it is. So it acts as a lesson to both
of us that if I do this, I might die. So we stay without going with other partners. I:
What did your wife say about it when responding to what you said? R: It's the same.
She says that we need to take care of ourselves, because we might say that we don't
have it while we have got it. So, let us continue the way we are, avoid other partners,
because if you do not, you die soon. That's what she said. (C-M-04)
I: Have you ever talked with your husband on the AIDS issue? R: Yes. I: O.k.! R:
We were talking that `My darling, this time it's dangerous...I: mmh....R: maybe I can
be moving with others, you can die because of me....I: mmh....'R: But that is not
good.' I: Eeh. R: We were both agreeing that it's not good and comforting one
another...I: Mmh...R: ...I should be looking after my partner and the partner looking
after me." (S-F-08)
I: Can you tell me when you talked with your husband about how you can protect
yourself from this disease in your house? R: With my husband, we talk daily. I: Day
by day? R: Yes. I: What does he say when you talk to him? R: Aah! The answer is
the same ­`I can take care of myself'­so I cannot know the life of my partner
inwardly. Mmh! Eeh! I: What makes you talk day after day? R: I have seen the
danger in the world, oh! (N-F-04).
These segments are typical not only in portraying perceptions of a joint fate, but also
in the assumption that the major source of infection is from a spouse who "moves" around.
This is supported by the 1998 household survey data, where respondents were asked what
they thought was the way they were most likely to contract AIDS. For males, 38%
answered that it was from "other partners"; while 23% reported that it was from their
spouse. More female respondents than male respondents thought their most likely risk was
from their spouse (51%), while 21% said it was from another partner. The qualitative
interviews, however, suggest that when women attributed risk to "other partners", they
mostly meant "other partners of my husband" or "other partners of myself if I had them."
This is not to say that all wives are faithful, but rather that both men and women are
reluctant to acknowledge the unfaithfulness of a wife to an interviewer. A man who has
evidence that his wife is unfaithful is expected to divorce her, and the norms about fidelity
for a woman are such that we expect women to under-report extramarital affairs. That
women's extramarital affairs are under-reported is suggested by the contrast between the
low proportion of female respondents on our survey that reported an extramarital affair and
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
264 http://www.demographic-research.org
the higher proportion (about double) of their "best friends" who the respondent said had
an extramarital affair. In addition, an intensive study of a sub-sample of the 1998 survey
respondents by Linda Tawfik asked women about the extramarital affairs of their married
female friends and men about their affairs with married women. Broaching these sensitive
questions only on a third interview with the respondent, Tawfik found that extramarital
affairs by women were not rare (Tawfik 2002).
5.2 Stimulus of HIV/AIDS conversations
If a respondent reported that the couple had not discussed AIDS, the interviewer asked why
that was the case. The answers were typically short; the respondents either simply repeated
that they had not talked, or said they did not talk because there was "no point". It may also
be that respondents simply did not wish to tell the interviewer about a conversation. On
occasion, however, the "no point" was amplified as the respondent explained that there was
no need to talk because they trusted each other or that the respondent (in this case, always
a wife) could not believe what the man would say, so there was no point in addressing the
topic.
I: Have you ever discussed with your spouse the dangers of AIDS? R: We have
never discussed the issue. I: Then why didn't you discuss with the spouse? R: There
is no reason. I: Therefore it means you don't get worried with the disease?
(laughter) R: It's a very dangerous disease and we do fear it. I: Then why not
[discuss]? R: It's because though we will discuss, there is nothing [we can do].I:
There isn't what? R: Though you try your best to discuss this, he will still continue
deceiving you and go with other women. I: Oh. R: Therefore you will be just
wasting your time and energy telling him. I: It means you don't totally trust him that
you think he does move with other women. R: Yes. I: Is there anywhere you got the
information that he has a girlfriend? R: I have never heard it. (S-F-19)
I: Why didn't you talk with him? R: Because everybody thinks that maybe my friend
[husband] takes care of himself. I: Ooh! You just think of that? R: Yes, thinking that
maybe he takes care of his body (S-F-21).
R: We already know that there is AIDS in the world and we hear about that in the
radio but we have never discussed. I: What do you hear on the radio? R: That they
have searched everywhere, but there is no cure for the disease...I: Since you say this
is in the mouths of people everywhere, haven't you discussed with her? R: She
already knows there is AIDS in the world, so we need not discuss because she also
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 265
hears it on the radio that the disease exists. So how do we discuss this when we
already have access to all the information we need from the radio? (N-M-18)
"No point" was likely to be explained in terms of either an expected disagreement with
the spouse, as in the segment above or the respondent explains that both husband and wife
have similar views so there is no point in a discussion. Of all the qualitative respondents,
7 women and 2 men said they had never discussed AIDS with a spouse.
If the respondent said that spousal discussion about AIDS had occurred, the
interviewer asked how the issue came up and who initiated the discussion. In the 14 cases
where women indicated who initiated the discussion, half were initiated by men and the
other half by women. The same breakdown was noted for men: 7 initiated by women, 8 by
men and 2 by both. However, in cases where the couple talked specifically about their own
risk or contracting the disease or where one spouse suspects the other of infidelity, wives
were more likely than husbands to initiate the conversation on AIDS. Out of the 18 cases
were one spouse suspects the other of infidelity, women initiated conversations in 13 and
men in 5 cases. It seems, therefore, that when couples are discussing HIV/AIDS in general,
men and women are equally likely to initiate the discussions, but women are more likely
to initiate discussions relating to the couple's own risk of contracting the disease. A study
of factors affecting husband's infidelity using the 1998 and 2001 survey data demonstrates
that suspicions about a spouse's fidelity are often not baseless; wives' suspicions remained
significantly associated with husband's infidelity even after controlling for other factors
typically associated with infidelity among men (Clark 2003).
In 37 cases the conversation began with a reference to something outside the domestic
sphere­hearing something about HIV/AIDS from the formal system (9 from the radio, 1
from clinic or health facilities), a conversation with a network partner (3), or, particularly,
mention of seeing or hearing about someone who was very ill or who was suspected of
having died of AIDS (24). Certainly the illness or death of friends, relatives or neighbors
is a topic of intense interest. But it may also be that beginning a discussion of AIDS with
a spouse by referring to something outside the home provides cover for the introduction of
what could be a sensitive topic, given the normative importance of marital fidelity and the
strong perception of the link between AIDS and infidelity.
5.3 Risk perception
In addition to conversations that were apparently provoked by something outside the
domestic sphere, some may have been provoked by an immediate need, specifically by the
perception of one of the spouses that the other needed to be persuaded to reform. In 41 of
the cases, the spouses caution each other against extramarital affairs, while in 20 cases the
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
266 http://www.demographic-research.org
wife cautions the husband, and in 4 the husband cautions the wife. The fact that concerns
about the risk from a partner is a central theme of the conversations is also evident in
examining the explanations that the 9 respondents who said they had never discussed AIDS
with their spouse gave:
R: That one's heart is the same as mine....I: How do you know? R: Ah, I see him. I:
Oho. R: Yes, because if a person is doing this and that, it is easy to see him. I: Just
to see a person, you can know his heart? R: Yes, of course, because I got married
to him long time ago but I never heard anything. I: You never heard anything about
him? R: I never heard anything and I never saw him going here and there (S-F-22).
The closest any male respondent came to admitting suspicions of his wife was one
man who, when asked whether he thought he might become infected by his wife, answered
as follows:
"I: Now have you heard that others are afraid of catching the disease from their
wives? R: Aah! No, I have never heard. I: Never? R: Yes. I: O.k., do you yourself
have those thoughts that you might catch this disease from your wife? R: I do have,
in my heart. I: If you do have, what do you tell your wife so she knows you are
afraid of catching AIDS from her? R: I do give her the family security, telling her
to remember of these issues, mmm! I: What do you tell her? R: 'My wife, you should
not forget the words I tell you, don't even once go out to walk with other men,
because if you do you will cut off your life and my life.' Eeeh!" (S-M-23).
It may be that more men did have suspicions, but in the context of rural Malawi it
would be embarrassing to admit that one was still married to an unfaithful wife. In contrast,
many women doubted their husband. In four cases the wife referred to specific cases of
infidelity. As evidence, women used observation: the husband returns from drinking late
at night and the wife warns him that drinking is one thing but moving with other women is
another. Or the wife may have found letters from another woman, found condoms in his
pocket, or other people have told her that they have seen him with another woman. A
woman with direct evidence has a number of options other than trying to persuade her
husband to reform­she may seek mediation from relatives, she may divorce him, or she
may harass the other woman by going to the other woman's house and challenging her by
saying "Is my husband there?", or even fighting with the other woman (Schatz 2002).
Women without specific evidence of a husband's infidelity may also have doubts based on
the widespread assumption that it is difficult for men to be satisfied with only one sexual
partner:
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 267
R: We have to care for our lives and he also tells me that even him, he doesn't go
with other women, no! Only one, so I don't know whether he tells me the truth. That
much I cannot know." ... Yes, I did tell him that night that `you can be cheating me
that you are not moving, well, it is better to go to those who have (keep) condoms
and take them wherever you go', but that is where we do not agree' (C-F-09)
I: Did you talk with your husband about how you can protect yourselves from
AIDS? R: Since I am a woman who always stays at home, we are tobacco growers
and if we have money, my husband goes to the bars to use the money with bar-girls.
Due to that problem, I do tell him that we are two wives so there is no reason for
going outside. It is better to use one of us for what he needs at that time other than
going to the bar and taking diseases for us. I: Did he agree that he will be sleeping
with the two of you only? R: He agreed but I don't know if it was true. I: Oooh!
Don't you trust him? R: I can't trust him much because it is always difficult for a
man to depend on one woman. (C-F-03)
I: Have you ever discussed with your wife in the house... about this story of AIDS?
R: We do discuss. I: What do you discuss? R: In discussing, we say that here, for
us to prevent this disease, there is need that each one should not do adultery. I: Who
starts this AIDS story in your house? R: My wife starts it. I: So how does she start
it? R: In starting it, it happens that maybe you were somewhere chatting, and that
you have come very late, and she asks you "aaa, when coming in this time, where
were you? Nowadays, it's dangerous. Maybe you were with other women, explain
it very well". So if you explain very well, it happens that she believes and that's
how a woman starts it. I: Now, when was the last time that you discussed this story
of AIDS? R: For the last time, the day before yesterday, I came very late, also the
day before yesterday. So my wife asked, "where were you?" I: So what did you say?
R: When she asked ... I replied that I was up there (nearby village) at Chilito. When
I told her that, she did not leave it there. In the morning, she went to ask if it was
true that I was there. Fortunately, they acknowledged that I was indeed there. (C-M-
16)
In a survey conducted in the same district in the South (Balaka) as the 1998 survey,
women and men were asked whether they agreed or disagreed that women and men could
be satisfied with only one sexual partner (Tavrow 1994). When respondents referred to the
other gender, about 54% of women and 45% of men said they disagreed; when respondents
referred to their own gender, about 40% of the men and 33% of the women said they
disagreed.
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
268 http://www.demographic-research.org
When a woman did directly accuse her husband in a conversation with him, these were
met either with denials or with the husband saying he had reformed and was not engaged
in such activity any more, or sometimes the husband tried not to prolong the conversation
by answering "Yes" or "No" and trying to be non committal. Women who had made an
explicit accusation typically did not challenge the denials or expressions of reform. Some,
however, indicated to the interviewer that they were not convinced:
R: Talking with him that, `as you know, the world is not good as it was before.
What's needed now is that we should depend upon each other to avoid having
it'...Eyaa! Since he is a man, he can just answer saying `yes', since he knows all the
ways to do things secretly. He knows, yes. Then everyday you just say `aaa! But my
friend, there is nothing good outside.' I: Eeh! He! What did he respond when you
said that? R: He just responded saying `aaa! I can't do that because I know that the
world nowadays is not good, so I can't do it [move around], let us just depend on
each other.' I: Did you believe his denials? R: I believe in him but not very, since
nobody knows what someone else is thinking about. But I don't think that is true,
because men are difficult. I: Mmm! And now if the husband has answered you as he
did, what did you answer then? R: I just said that `o.k., since you already know that
there is a dangerous disease outside. If you trust me, let us continue.' (S-F-17).
I: O.k., what about your husband, have you ever talked with him about AIDS? R:
Yes, he talked also. I: Oh. R: Eh. I: So can you remember the last time you talked
about the issue? R: Because for the men they can be saying `There is a dangerous
disease, I can't walk in the bush, I can't do this.' But sometimes they do what they
denied they could do. For example, now he was saying that he can't have two wives,
but as of now he has married another wife. So can I believe that he can't do bad
things? I: Eh. R: He can do because he has already done it. He doesn't know if the
woman he has married is fine or even that she has a disease, or even me, I cannot
know. I: ooh. So that day when he was saying that, what happened for him to talk
like that? R: Ah, only that he was happy himself. So when he was happy like that he
started talking. I: Eh. R: So what was wrong in his mind, I can't know, for it is men.
I: Eh. R: So I just heard `I want to marry another wife'. Then I said, `okay, go and
marry.' Can I stop him while his heart wants? He can go. I: So what did you tell him
the day he started talking about AIDS? R: I told him that "If a person moves around,
you take diseases­for example, for you and me, for us women, you can be saying
that `You have your husband, you can't go in the bush [outside marriage], and you
stay at home. But maybe you men can be saying that `I don't want my wife to walk
in the bush' but you are the one who walks in the bush and take the disease and gives
it to your wife in the house, and the wife becomes sick and you the owner become
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 269
sick too. That is a very difficult way.' He said `Oh me no, I cannot do that', but now
he has done the same thing he said he cannot do. (S-F-18).
I: So, what about this issue of AIDS? What conversation did you have with your
husband? R: We talked. I said: "You should stop moving around. There is AIDS
these days. It is important to take care of yourself". I: Ah ah! So what did he say?
R: He just said: "That's true". But I cannot trust what he says. I: Why can't you trust
what he says? R: Ah, men move around too much. I: Ah ah! They go this way and
that way? R: mmmh that's it. I: So you fear that your husband might be going out
with this woman and that woman? R: Eeeh, these men, you can't tell. I: Oh, you just
wonder? R: Yes, I don't know. I: So you just fear? R: Eeeh, it is really better to die
from a disease from God [rather than from AIDS]. (C-F-18).
5.4 Marital relationship
Directly challenging a spouse about infidelity risks an argument, which both spouses try to
avoid because persistent arguments are not compatible with a good marriage. This is
evident in the persistent use of the pronoun "we" rather than "you", e.g. "We must be
careful, my friend" rather than "you must be careful". There is perhaps a somewhat greater
burden on the wife to avoid an argument, related to gender roles: wives' "rudeness" is often
given by men as a justification for divorce (Schatz 2002), but the reciprocal is often not the
case. Moreover, the woman faces the threats of violence, or the husband leaving her and
taking another wife. Thus, when talking with their husbands, women were much more likely
to talk in general terms about men's behavior (as noted earlier, only four made reference
to specific infidelity) and to present women in general and themselves in particular to
simply be "at home", in the domestic space while men were exposed to the temptations of
the world.
African marriages are sometimes characterized as being based more on utilitarian than
emotional considerations. The parents of our respondents interviewed in a separate project
complained that marriages of today are shallow, quickly made and quickly broken, unlike
those of their generation (Kaler 2001). Yet in interviews about marriage conducted in
another project, respondents often spoke of marrying for love (Schatz 2002), and many of
our interviews suggest some level of intimacy and closeness between husbands and wives:
R: "After we eat nsima [the staple food, made of maize flour] and get enough, we
talk that "you have seen that there is AIDS nowadays...I: ...eh....R: ...so AIDS is
difficult...I: Eh...R: Every person should be at home with his wife...I: eh...R: ...if you
are not married keep quiet, and better get married....I: eh...R: ...because the disease
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8

is difficult. I: Eh. R: It is different from other diseases. I: Eh. R: Some diseases get
better if you take medicine, a person recovers....I: Eeeh...R: But this disease...I:
eh...R: ...has no medicine. I: Eh. R: No medicine, we die (S-F-13).
R: As we're lying in bed at night, I often talk to my wife and tell her that `My wife'
and she said `Eeh', `know that this world is now dangerous, as we are married we
should try to avoid moving. And take care about the family. The disease is now too
dangerous, you may catch the disease and give it to me, or I may catch the disease
and give it to you. Then we all die, and our children will suffer later on... (S-M-23)
Spousal discussions of AIDS were often framed in terms of care for the children: they
give the strong impression of husbands and wives committed to the joint responsibility of
raising and providing for their children. The speakers often explicitly note that if one is
infected, both will die, but the emphasis is on the fate of their children should they be left
orphans. Concern for the children appears to be genuine and profound, but it may also serve
a tactical purpose, a way of emphasizing the importance of AIDS by noting its implications
not for the health and well-being of the speaker but for their descendants:
R: Myself, I said...that you are seeing your friends are dying leaving the children.
Is it good that your children should also be suffering like this? ...Because if it has
affected one, killed one, the other is also finishing [dying]... So there is nobody to
care for the children here on earth. Ah! We are seeing our friends dying­-how they
are dying. In our family, our sisters, and our brothers­they have all finished [died]
leaving children-­orphans. (N-F-23).
R: I talked with him that nowadays, we have to depend on each other because there
is a dangerous disease of AIDS. I: Was that sentence spoken by you or your
husband? R: I was the one talking. I: What did he answer you? R: He said that `Of
course, I am controlling myself to avoid the virus which causes AIDS because AIDS
is killing many people and if I die my children will suffer because there is nobody
to look after them since my mother is very old. I: When he answered you, what did
you say then? R: I said that `If you are controlling yourself, then you are right
because I can control myself, but to a man it is difficult so you must try hard to
control yourself.' (C-F-06)
I: Eeeh, have you ever discussed with your wife this issue of AIDS? R: We do
discuss, that, `see now out there it is dangerous, we must take care of ourselves.
Because if we will go on unknown ways we are going to be injured. See, there are
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 271
children, they will be orphans, who would take care of them?' And she was agreeing
that `It is true, we must be careful.' (S-M-07)
Although children are often emphasized, this is not invariable: the majority (22 cases)
referred to the importance of avoiding AIDS either for sake of the children alone or of the
parents and the children. However, in 18 cases it was the parents themselves who were of
central concern.
R: We talk...that `my wife, sometimes men who move and women who move are
problematic, because I can get the disease of AIDS outside and run into the house
and then meet you and give it to you, thus...I have destroyed the marriage... So who
is going to work for me then? ... Nobody to work with me... Or you will move and
give me a disease, and who is going to help you with development [improving the
family's wellbeing]? (S-M-13)
Sometimes women use examples of their friends, relatives or neighbors as a way of
justifying the conversation and also to support their claims (12 cases). For instance,
couples where one partner is having extra marital affairs is mentioned as a way of warning
the partner to avoid having such affairs, and also as a way pointing out their dangers; for
instance the danger of HIV/AIDS infection for both partners. The same strategy is also
used in spousal discussions relating to use of contraceptives. Women mostly cite other
people who are using family planning and how it has greatly assisted these persons or the
problems they have faced because of using family planning methods depending on whether
the conversation is for or against family planning. Examples of families with many children
who are constantly sick or starving are mentioned as a way of bringing up a conversation
on family planning.
Although we did not specifically ask the respondents whether the discussions about
the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS helped in promoting preventive sexual behavior, there
is a sense in the reports that those who initiated the discussions believed, or at the very least
hoped, that the discussions would lead to reform in behavior. Many women who had doubts
about their husbands' fidelity pleaded with them to stop moving around or avoid the
temptations of the world to save their own lives, and ensure that their children do not suffer
when orphaned. In some cases, as the examples below show, some of the men conceded
that the discussions got them to think twice about their behavior:
I: So, did you speak about AIDS in your house? R: We had a conversation. I: Who
started to speak about this story? R: Who started to speak was my wife. She said,
'My husband, the greatest thing, I'm your wife. Don't just say if you go to Ulongwe
or Liwonde (nearby small towns) or elsewhere and start gazing at women (being
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8

272 http://www.demographic-research.org
attracted to). I: mmh! R: 'No, my husband, not that.'so I listened to her...I: mmh!
R: Because I know that when this woman is warning me with these words, she is
giving me life.'I: mmh! R: If I ignore her and say what she tells me is useless, in
the end I might get into problems .... So I listen to her...I must hear what my
friend (wife) says. (S-M-02)
I: Oh! So what did you say? R: I said that, but in this world there is a disease, we
must fear for each other...I: eh... R: in what we do I: Ooh, so you just said so? R:
Yes. I: Didn't you continue? R: No, I didn't continue. I: So what did he answer?
R: He said, oh, I think each person should take care of himself. I: Oh, so what did
he mean by "take care of yourself?" R: Taking care of yourself means that they
should avoid moving around with other women outside. I: Eh R: Mmmm. I: Ooh.
So for you to start this story that there is AIDS, as you have explained, how did
it start, what started it? R: I was surprised with his movements. Eh, he was coming
late at night, and then I started saying 'aah, he will bring me what? He will bring
me AIDS.'I: Have you ever heard your husband express his worried about AIDS?
R: Him? I: Yes. R: He talks. I: What does he say? R: He says that...I: Eeeeh. R:
'me, though they are saying that I do move around...I: Eeeeh R: Those people ...
they are not saying good things, nowadays I have changed. (S-F-20).
Whether the conversations actually lead to a reform of sexual behavior or not is a
critical issue that is beyond the scope of this paper. As mentioned before, some studies
suggest that spousal communication may be associated with adoption of preventive
behavior, including HIV testing (Shoop and Davidson 1994; Rickman et al. 1994;
DiClemente 1991; Zamboni, Crawford and Williams 2000; Gage and Ali 2003).
6. Conclusion
While various studies have shown that spousal communication facilitates adoption of
modern family planning, little is known about the relationship between spousal
communication and adoption of protective behavior against HIV/AIDS, as well as factors
that facilitate or inhibit spousal communication. In this study we use quantitative and
qualitative data collected from rural Malawi to examine correlates of husband-wife
communication about the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and what husbands and wives say
to each other about their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in order to understand the strategies
that couples are following to prevent the intrusion of AIDS into the home.
The quantitative data show that the most important factors influencing spousal
communication about the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS are size of the woman's informal
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 273
social network, accessing information about the disease from clinics, whether the couple
have also discussed use of family planning or not (which we interpret as a proxy for the
general level of spousal conversation about reproductive health issues) and the extent of
worry about contracting the disease. Similar factors generally determine whether husbands
and wives agree that they talked or not, although the results for spousal discordance are less
clear-cut and consistent. These data, thus, highlight the importance of access to information
about AIDS and worrying about the disease in spousal communication; people who interact
with others more and those who report more program information are more likely to bring
up the issues with their spouses than those who do not have large social networks and
program connections.
The qualitative data show that spousal communication is an important mechanism
through which married people express their fears and anxieties to their partner as a result
of the recognition that controlling their own behavior is not sufficient. The discussions of
HIV/AIDS risk and preventive strategies within marriage are often introduced with
reference to specific stories and events relating to AIDS and irresponsible sexual behavior.
These discussions on HIV/AIDS are conducted cautiously, and, for the most part, to avoid
marital conflicts and disagreement. The common strategy that is followed to achieve a
harmonious discussion is to introduce the discussion with reference either to something or
to someone outside the domestic sphere or to concerns about the implications of the disease
on their children should both parents die. Contrary to the pessimistic accounts in the
literature about how people have lost hope and given up to fate on HIV/AIDS in Africa, the
qualitative data show that husbands and wives in rural Malawi are actively confronting and
challenging their spouses to prevent the intrusion of the vicious disease into their lives.
When the couple fails to achieve such a discussion, the recourse is to seek intervention
from relatives or friends, although serious disagreements on these issues may lead to
physical confrontations or divorce.
Most discussion on the joint HIV/AIDS risk, especially those where one spouse
suspects the other of infidelity, are introduced by women. This is not surprising, since it
is generally understood in these communities by both men and women that men indulge in
extra marital relationships more than their wives. Women often make reference to
discussions that they have had with their friends about AIDS and how the disease is
devastating their communities by killing husbands and wives, leaving children to suffer.
So, rather than the women arguing that the man should not indulge in reckless sexual
behavior because he would infect and kill her, she focuses on what would happen to the
children if both of them die. While the discussion may become confrontational if the
woman directly accuses her husband and the man denies her accusations, the focus on the
future of the children or talking about men's irresponsible sexual behavior in more general
terms appears to be a strategy to ensure that the discussion is constructive and that the
couple agree that there is indeed need to be careful and/or reform sexual behavior. Men
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 8
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
274 http://www.demographic-research.org
normally respond to such general discussions, and even to direct accusations of infidelity,
by saying that they are aware of how dangerous the world has become, and that they are not
foolish to be sleeping around recklessly, even when the evidence is there that they have
been doing otherwise. The wives are often not fooled by such responses, though, because
when asked what they think about what the husbands responded, some say that it is just a
man's way of saying "no", and that it is not easy for a man to stick to one woman.
Although the reported conversations are brief, they give a clear indication that verbal
communication is actively utilized as a key strategy by marital partners, particularly wives,
to persuade each other to avoid extramarital affairs to avoid falling victim of the AIDS
menace. The urgency to fight the threat of HIV/AIDS to marital partners has been paused
as one of the key factors leading to the decline in the period of postpartum sexual
abstinence in Malawi and other settings in sub-Saharan Africa (Cleland, Ali and Capo-
Chichi 1998, Zulu 2001). Wives, who bear most of the responsibility for observance of
abstinence, are increasingly giving in to their husbands' demands to resume intercourse
before the end of the normative duration of postpartum abstinence because of fears that the
men may go to other women and bring the HIV/AIDS virus home (Zulu 1996)."
It is noteworthy, however, that none of the spousal discussions reported in this study
made reference to use of condoms when discussing strategies to deal with the joint risk of
contracting HIV/AIDS within marriage. The one reference to condoms was made by a
woman who was telling her supposedly promiscuous husband to use condoms with his other
women; all discussions of preventive strategies within marriage focused on fidelity. This
confirms many other findings that signify the negative view associated with condom use
within marriage. The condom is widely believed to be associated with extra-marital sex and
asking for it, even in cases where the spouse knows or suspects that the partner is having
other affairs, brings all sorts of tensions that many spouses are not prepared to deal with.
