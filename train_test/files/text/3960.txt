Introduction
In recent years, in the social sciences, interest has grown in
both realism and complexity approaches. With few excep-
tions,notablyintheworkofDavidByrneandEmmaUprichard
(Byrne, 1998; Byrne and Uprichard, 2012), these two
approaches have not converged, either philosophically or
methodologically. In this article, we make a modest attempt,
through an empirical example, to show how complexity and
realism do converge, but also how that convergence can be
harnessed to produce novel and useful understandings of
micro- and meso-level social change.
This article will proceed as follows: we will begin by restat-
ing the case for a realist approach to social research and intro-
duce some suggested modifications to what has become the
dominant view of realism in social science ­ that of `critical
realism'. In two further brief sections, we outline some features
of probability theory and complexity that might be incorporated
into a complex-realist approach to social investigation.
Following this, we provide an empirical example of how social
continuity and change can be demonstrated using a complex-
realist approach to researching the trajectories of prisoners at
risk of self-harm.
Realism, complexity and probability
Realism
Through the 20th century, realism has offered an alternative
paradigm in scientific thinking to that of idealism and
positivism, and their variants (Harré, 1986). It differs from
these (which would include phenomenology, logical positiv-
ism, instrumentalism, etc.) by equally privileging the issue of
what exists, alongside our warrant to know what exists. That
is, it reinstates ontology, which has been denied or postponed
in rival philosophies of science. To its critics, this is a leap of
faith for it requires the theorisation of non-observables and
their treatment as entities, or potentially so. In much of the
earlier discussions of realism (see, for example, Potter,
1996), entities were seen as simplified physical things or
forces, capable of measurement. Relativist critics of realism,
in social science, referred to this as the `death and furniture'
argument, suggesting that social processes were dynamic,
complex and, most of all, socially constructed and inevitably
interpreted (Potter, 1996). In the natural sciences, this was
already a bit of a straw person; where realist interpretations
of wave­particle duality, in quantum physics, posited an
interaction between observer and the collapse of the wave
function. In other words, the issues raised by unobservables
in the physical world were meat and drink to realist philoso-
phers of natural science. It has been a long while since the
Complex realism in social research

Abstract
In recent years, both realism and complexity have begun to have methodological influence in social research. Yet for the most part,
these have existed separately and have had limited impact on empirical research. In this article, we develop a theoretical argument
for complex realism, grounded in an ontology of probability, that may be operationalised to demonstrate the reality of social change
at a micro- and meso-level. We apply our conception of complex realism to an example using the method of longitudinal case­based
cluster analysis to analyse the trajectories over time of male and female prisoners aged 18 and above who were at risk of self-harm.

physicist, in the laboratory, was able to rely on his or her own
senses for empirical confirmation or falsification!
However, Potter and other relativists do have a point
about the social world, in that not only is it endlessly dynamic
but its existence and its development depend on human inter-
action and, at root, individual action born of interpretation.
As Norman Denzin (1983) claimed, there is an `inherent
indeterminateness in the lifeworld' (p. 133). This is a seduc-
tive claim and one often deployed against realism. But, on
the other hand, a moment's reflection shows this to be a
claim too far. To begin with, supporters of social indetermin-
ism must explain how it is that social order exists and is
maintained and, perhaps paradoxically, how sometimes it
breaks down or changes quite dramatically. Added to this, if
the world was so indetermined and simply a product of con-
sciousness (as Denzin goes on to claim), then the constraints
that prevent us from doing just as we wish (laws, rules, sanc-
tions and physical constraints created by humans) should be
routinely capable of transcendence, but they are not.
Social science variants of realism do, however, seem to go
the other way,1 with what might be described as a `strong'
version of causality that depends on natural necessity. Critical
realism, the dominant variety in social science, relies on the
idea of `causal powers' (elsewhere often referred to as `dis-
positions'; Mumford, 2007). These can be either passive or
active, depending on context. Take the example of `labour
power', used by Andrew Sayer (1992) ­ in his words,
The nature or constitution of an object and its causal powers are
internally or necessarily related: a plane can fly by virtue of its
aerodynamic form, engines etc; gunpowder can explode by
virtue of its unstable chemical structure; multinational firms can
sell their products dear and buy their labour cheap by virtue of
operating in several countries with different levels of
development ... (p. 105)
However, gunpowder and multinational firms have quite
different kinds of dispositional properties. The unstable
chemical structure of gunpowder can be explained by a rela-
tively small number of environmental contingencies, them-
selves grounded in physical laws, whereas multinational
firms are time-specific evolving and their dispositions
explained only in relation to other evolving structures, them-
selves having a dispositional character.
In order to work, people must sell their labour, or make a
product that they can sell, and there has to be a demand for
their labour, or product. A person may possess labour power,
but the circumstances under which this may be activated or
sustained can vary enormously. At no point can we specify a
set of conditions necessary to the exercise of labour power,
though of course we might specify sufficient conditions.
Powers must be realised under particular circumstances, but
their necessity is ever elusive.
Critical realism and its variants face both an ontological
paradox and an epistemological one. The ontological one is
that the strong version of causality they propose is (at least
apparently) deterministic, yet the causal powers responsible
are indeterministic. The `real' world is ontologically indeter-
ministic, yet structured. It is complex.
Complexity
Some systems in the world are deterministic and most of
these are more closely bound by fundamental physical laws,
such as gravity and thermodynamics. They will never be
entirely deterministic because local variations of (say) air
pressure or material construction will intervene. Some phe-
nomena are wholly stochastic, for example, particles sus-
pended in a fluid (described as Brownian motion), some are
apparently stochastic, but through time some patterning can
be discerned, and others, though exhibiting some degree of
randomness, nevertheless exhibit order and form over time.
Indeed, all phenomena that might be described probabilisti-
cally exhibit some degree of stochastic behaviour. Karl
Popper (1979) provided us with a useful analogy (p. 296),
when he contrasted the behaviour of clouds with that of
clocks. The former have measurable properties, but these can
only be approximately known and measured through time,
whereas clocks (and he meant old-fashioned clockwork
clocks) have relatively precise mechanisms that behave in a
reliable and predictable way. Some systems, he goes on to
say, are more like clouds and some more like clocks.
This is a good analogy for the social world, in which its
components are mostly more cloud than clock like, yet some
parts of it will veer towards `clockness', while others hardly
achieve the recognisable form of clouds.
Clocks are complicated systems, so are mobile phones,
motorbikes and space shuttles, but they are not complex ­ their
behaviour and properties are not subject to influence of ran-
dom variables (at least when they are working properly)
(Cilliers, 1998). Clouds are, and so are most phenomena in the
social world. This distinction is at the heart of the development
of `chaos theory', and complexity, in the last 50years. The dis-
covery of `chaos' was in the behaviour of weather systems.
Well into the 20th century, meteorologists subscribed to the
view that if we knew enough about initial conditions, we
would be able to predict and even control the weather. But in
the 1960s, scientists modelling weather found that very slight
changes in initial conditions could bring about huge changes
in weather patterns later (Gleick, 1987: 14­15). The discovery
of chaos heralded a whole new way of thinking about the natu-
ral (and later social) world. Researchers noted how relatively
stable systems in weather, oceans and biological systems
could change suddenly, or descend into apparent disorder, and
conversely, how apparently stochastic systems could become
ordered. Complex systems, exhibiting such characteristics,
exist throughout nature in the development of galaxies to cell
division (Kauffman, 1995). There is much to say about chaos
and complexity, but for our purposes, it is enough to make a
few observations about the social world that suggest that it and
its components are a quintessentially complex system.
Williams and Dyer 3
The first thing to note is that despite what the social con-
structionists would say, it is possible to explain and predict
the social world, partly because it is rule based and partly
because agents in it act inductively on past experience, which
mostly exhibits a large degree of predictability. In other
words, in our everyday lives, we are aware of and (mostly)
obey social rules, and those people with whom we interact
also do this and exhibit relatively predictable behaviour. This
permits good enough lay explanations and predictions. It is
mostly not stochastic. Social scientists, who wish to produce
explanations and predictions with a greater precision, see a
world that exhibits both continuity and change, but is also
characterised by similarity and difference across social strata
and time. It is fashionable to say that social scientists study
social change, but in order to do this, they must also explain
social stability. Stability is not stasis and will be disturbed
eventually to one extent or another. As Harvey and Reed
(cited in Byrne, 1998: 23) put it, in the absence of significant
perturbations, systems will follow a normal trajectory, but if
disrupted, random fluctuations may arise. Our clock analogy
has one further use: a mechanical clock, with a pendulum, is
a relatively precise and predictable instrument, but if you
disturb the pendulum, it will fluctuate randomly and, depend-
ing how much you disturbed it, that degree of randomness
persists for a greater or lesser period, until it returns to equi-
librium. Whack it hard enough and the `randomness' may
preclude a return to equilibrium, because you have broken it!
Complexity theorists employ a vocabulary of `Strange
Attractors' and `Phase Space' to describe this. Strange
Attractors, in complexity theory, refers to time-ordered pat-
terns towards which other trajectories converge. Strange
Attractors can be understood to exist within `Phase Space',
the space of the possible where anything can happen but not
everything will happen given the structured, rule-driven
nature of the social:
The geometry of dynamical systems takes place in a mental
space, known as phase space. It's very different from ordinary
physical space. Phase space contains not just what happens but
what might happen under different circumstances. It's the space
of the possible. (Cohen and Stewart, 1994: 200)
The social world can therefore be thought of as overlap-
ping, or multi-dimensional, `phase spaces', with different
probabilities and trajectories of change.
For example, some social institutions, or practices, may
exist for centuries, changing only slightly, because they have
not been `disturbed'. Others exist so briefly they are hardly
named or recognised because they are greatly disturbed.
Compare, for example, the institutions of a country in flux,
such as Somalia, with the stability of Switzerland.
These kinds of comparisons are popular with those who
write about social complexity (and rightly so), but this works
better for historians or political scientists than it does for
social researchers attempting to describe and explain social
life at the micro- or meso-level. In particular, how do the
specific changes and interactions at individual level create,
maintain, change or destroy specific local systems? We use
the term `systems'as a portmanteau term to describe ways of
doing things, mores, customs, rules ­ the reality of social life
as experienced and acted upon by agents. Although the
explanation of continuity is crucial (why does the social tra-
jectory of an institution or practice remain undisturbed?), to
do this, we need to know what is going on at the point of
change and how that point of change is (seemingly) related
to further change. Unlike Hume, who said that the striking of
one billiard ball against another is no warrant to claim the
cause of the second moving was the striking of the first, as
realists, we want to theorise a system (or mechanism) that
will provide an explanation. Thus, measurement, in complex
systems, is an important aspect of realist `closure'.
Probability
We noted that stochastic systems are described by probabil-
ity. Objective probability (as opposed to subjective, or
Bayesian probability) takes both an epistemological and an
ontological form. The first is familiar to us, through the sam-
ple survey, and is known as the frequency theory of probabil-
ity. A probabilistic sample of a given population can
statistically describe that population, within certain known
and calculable tolerances. Those tolerances are described in
the error terms of a sample and are subject to the law of large
numbers. Roughly speaking, the larger the sample, the
smaller the error term. That is, the bigger the sample, the bet-
ter it will resemble the population. However, a sample can
tell us nothing about the individual units (often people)
because they are an `ideal' unit, that is, we do not have data
on all members of a population and we could substitute one
random sample for another, within which those in the second
may or may not have been in the first.
There is another version of objective probability that is
ontological in character and better mirrors what is meant by
`probability' in relation to complex systems (Gillies, 2000:
113­168; Williams and Dyer, 2009).2 While our knowledge
of complex systems may be probabilistic (in the first, episte-
mological, sense), it is the very character of the systems and
components of systems that are themselves probabilistic in
character. To fully grasp this, we need to consider what we
mean by probability, in relation to certainty. The probability
of an event always lies on a continuum between 0 and 1. Zero
is the impossibility of an event and one is its necessity. All
probabilities eventually resolve themselves into zeros or
ones. So, for example, an accused person will have a proba-
bility of conviction, which may change as a trial progresses,
but eventually will evolve into a `One' when the judge pre-
sents his or her verdict. That One may be `guilty' or `not
guilty'. To continue the hypothetical story, the One of `guilty'
or 'not guilty' will then set the probability of future events,
such as going to prison, re-offending (if guilty), personal
stigma and so on. Also, the verdict is not neutral in respect of
4 Methodological Innovations
the other agents involved, such as family members, police
officers, co-accused, victims and so on. Each of their life tra-
jectories will be `perturbed' and the probabilities of future
events initially set, or changed. In other words, the probabili-
ties are `nested' and changed at each bifurcation (such as the
judgement of guilty or `not guilty').
The story so far
Before introducing the empirical example, let us summarise
the theoretical and methodological case we are making.
The reality of the social world is that it is indeterminate. As
one of us has argued elsewhere (Williams, 2011), there are
no necessary conditions in the social world, but rather there
are different levels of sufficiency, enough to produce out-
comes. In the physical world, such grounding exists in fun-
damental laws such as gravity or thermodynamics
(Mumford, 2007: 74). However, in the social world, most
outcomes exist within relatively stable rule-bound social
structures, but change comes about as a result of perturba-
tions ­ the greater the perturbation, the greater the change.
It follows that probability is not just an epistemological
matter of describing or predicting change, the social world
itself is probabilistic, with some things very much more
probable than others. Within `phase space', all outcomes
are possible, but some are very much more probable than
others. Yet it is often the `improbable' outcome that brings
about greater change. The challenge is to develop a method
that can follow these changes, or map these trajectories, in
actual systems over time.
Example ­ mapping the trajectories of
prisoner repeat self-harm
Background
The data presented in this example were originally collected as
part of a National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)-funded
research project one of us was involved with which aimed to
identify a set of characteristics to assess future risk of self-
harm in adult male and female prisoners (Horton et al., 2014).
Prisoners are at increased risk of self-harm (Fazel et al., 2011;
Hawton et al., 2014; Ministry of Justice, 2015). However, not
all prisoners experience the same level of risk; in particular,
there are a small number of prisoners who are responsible for
a large number of self-harm events. Much of the research and
theories in the area of self-harm broadly derive from the `Cry
of Pain'model (Williams, 1997) which suggests self-harm is a
behavioural response to a stressful situation with three compo-
nents which interact to increase risk, namely, (1) the presence
of defeat, (2) no escape or entrapment, and (3) no rescue. At a
general level, prisoners share similar sociodemographic char-
acteristics and all experience the `pains of imprisonment'
(Sykes, 2007 [1958]). Why then are only some rather than all
prisoners at `ultra-high risk' of repeated self-harm?
As we noted above, the social world is neither simply
determinate nor chaotically indeterminate or stochastic.
Cases (in this case prisoners) will experience periods of rela-
tive stability and periods of change where, dependent upon
perturbations or `disturbances' in their current conditions,
their lives will bifurcate along different pathways (in this
case to repeat self-harm or not). Prisoners are not one single,
homogeneous group but instead consist of different groups
or types of people, some of whom share common patterns of
experiences and individual characteristics. Rather than one
`cry of pain' model, how different groups of prisoners cope
with perturbations caused by the `pains of life', including
imprisonment, will be different, but within groups, their
shared experiences give rise to the same or similar outcomes.
In other words, while we can identify the immediate pertur-
bations that cause the self-harm, as in a Markov chain, these
initially appear to be independent of patterns of prior events.
The aim of this research was to identify different groups or
types of prisoner where membership (described by shared
patterns of experiences and personal characteristics) meant
they were at increased or decreased probability of repeated
self-harm in prison.
Methodology and method
This search for prisoner groups or typologies that are more or
less likely to repeatedly self-harm is akin to the search for
`Strange Attractors' described earlier in this article. Such
`prisoner self-harm attractors' (in a metaphorical sense)
emerge over time as shared individual characteristics such as
resilience and coping (the hidden mechanism in Realism),
which develop iteratively as a consequence of common
experiences (the contexts in Realism), mean that pathways or
personal trajectories converge. Strange Attractors describe a
series of bifurcations in systems, for example, in turbulence
flow, which produces patterns, shapes or likenesses. In this
case, it is people who are more like one another than they are
like people in other attractors. These underlying patterns or
`prisoner self-harm attractors' exist within Phase Space ­ the
macro-level conception of context within which are micro
multiple overlapping contexts or `state spaces'. These con-
texts include prisoners' previous experiences which impact
on the development of individual characteristics, including
individual vulnerabilities, resilience and coping, and how
they interact with the current prison environment (Griller,
2014; Liebling, 2005; Slade et al., 2014), as described in
Figure 1 (a conceptual model or abstraction of the complex-
realist `space' within which prisoner self-harm pathways can
be understood).
This framework informed the development of the research
study:
·
· From data collection: where a multi-stage prospective
cohort study recorded data (including personal experi-
ences, thoughts, feelings and actions) describing the
Williams and Dyer 5
`history' and `current' micro-contexts or state spaces
for male and female prisoners aged 18 and above who
were on an Assessment, Care in Custody, and
Teamwork (ACCT ­ a Prison Service Instruction
2012, which describes the process involved in super-
vising the management of prisoners at risk of harm to
self, to others and from others) (Ministry of Justice
and National Offender Management Service, 2012),
and a 6-month follow-up determined self-harm occur-
rence since baseline;
·
· To data analysis: where logistic regression analysis
revealed gender-specific characteristics that were sta-
tistically significant in identifying prisoners who were
involved with repeat self-harm, and which mapped
directly onto a number of gender-specific prisoner
self-harm typologies or attractors, uncovered using a
time-ordered cluster analysis method developed by
one of us (Dyer, 2006, 2011).
Results
The results described four male and four female prisoner self-
harm attractors defined by a number of bifurcation points
(including history, current and future), where key experiences
and personal characteristics ­ such as a history of self-harm
outside of prison and/or within prison, a history of contact
with a psychiatrist, current feelings of self-blame and inability
to concentrate ­ are responsible for perturbations in the trajec-
tory which led prisoners down one pathway which included
repeat self-harm or another other with no repeat self-harm.
The first male trajectory (see Figure 2) describes the shared
experience and characteristics of those prisoners all of whom
repeated self-harm during the 6-month follow-up. This is a key
Attractor which gives clues to the increased probability of
repeat self-harm in this high-risk prisoner population when
compared with the other Attractors, which map the trajectories
of those who do not repeat self-harm during the follow-up. The
key differences or points of perturbation between the two most
similar male prisoner Attractors 1 (where everyone went on to
repeat self-harm) and 4 (where no one went on to repeat self-
harm) are the presence or absence of a previous experience of
prison ACCT monitoring, and the presence or absence of a
number of key experiences and personal characteristics labelled
as `risk and protective factors'in the original study.
Findings from the study of male prisoners at ultra-high risk
of repeat self-harm suggest the probability of a negative out-
come is greatly reduced for those in Attractors 2 and 3 who
have no previous experience of self-harm or ACCT monitor-
ing in prison and who report more positive thoughts, feelings,
actions and experiences, and fewer negative ones. A number
of factors identified as greatly increasing the probability of a
negative outcome are shared by bothAttractors 1 and 4 includ-
ing a history of previous self-harm, contact with a Psychiatrist
and current feelings of self-blame and inability to concentrate.
However, those in Attractor 4 are much less likely to repeat
self-harm because they also report a number of features in
addition to no previous experience of prison ACCT monitor-
ing which `protect'them from this negative outcome including
having obtained academic or vocational qualifications and
current access to support from prison healthcare.
Figure 1. A conceptual model of the Phase Space of prisoner self-harm attractors.
6 Methodological Innovations
Interpreting the female attractors is a more difficult under-
taking, not least because the risk and protective factors iden-
tified by the original logistic regression do not map as clearly
onto the female attractors, again uncovered using a time-
ordered cluster method, as they did for the male attractors.
The first female trajectory (see Figure 3) describes the shared
experience and characteristics of those who repeated self-
harm during the 6-month follow-up. The key points of per-
turbation between the two most similar female prisoner
Attractors 1 (where everyone went on to repeat self-harm)
and 4 (where no one went on to repeat self-harm) which
increase the probability of repeat self-harm include
·
· A consistent history of previous contact with a psy-
chiatrist and current mental health symptoms such as
auditory hallucinations,
·
· A history of scratching as a specific form of self-harm
and current episodes of binge eating,
·
· The experience of previous prison ACCT monitoring,
·
· A significant current prison sentence such as life
imprisonment or an indeterminate sentence,
·
· Reports of negative personal actions such as recent
episodes of binge eating, physical assault on others
and various forms of self-harm especially scratching
but also including cutting, head banging, burning, pre-
venting wounds from healing and making medical
situations worse.
There is one risk factor shared by Attractors 1 and 4 which
increases the probability of repeat self-harm and this involves
the receipt of any form of outside communication, that is, fam-
ily visits, phone calls and letters. Attractor 4 also experiences
much more consistent negative `symptoms' compared with
attractor 1, but which includes negative thoughts and feelings
(including `over the last week talking to people has felt too
much for me', `anxiety has prevented me doing important
things', `I have felt panic', `made plans to end my life', and
`felt overwhelmed by my problems') rather than actions (as in
attractor 1, including `during the last week I had episodes of
binge eating', `over the last week I have been physically violent
to others'and `I have scratched myself on purpose'), and which
common sense might argue should put them at greatly increased
probability of a negative outcome. However, female prisoners
in Attractor 4 did not go on to repeat self-harm during follow-
up, which suggests that the key features which `protect' them
from this negative outcome include no previous experience of
prison ACCT monitoring and that reporting negative thoughts
and feelings is not the same as actually acting on them.

This empirical example demonstrates how the application of
a complex-realist framework and associated methodology and
techniques can uncover patterns of similarity and difference at
the level of individual cases which, rather than suggesting the
social world is either deterministic or stochastic, demonstrates
that common or shared contextual experiences and the hidden
mechanism of personal characteristics lead to common or
shared outcomes. This being the case, rather than applying the
`cry of pain' model at a macro- or generalised level, we could
use data for individual prisoners with similar experiences to cal-
culate the likely probability of future repeat self-harm events.
The methodological possibility of
complex realism
The above examples demonstrate how within a relatively
`contained' phase space, change occurs and patterns are
established. There is an absence of necessity in these trajec-
tories because they can be changed as a result of relatively
minor perturbations (e.g. a history of previous ACCT moni-
toring). Yet what we witness is the reality of a complex
causal system operating through time. Although, here, the
probabilities themselves have not been measured, the clus-
tering itself demonstrates that some events are very much
more likely to happen than others. The history of ACCT
monitoring in individuals, played out through bifurcations in
respect of variables through time, demonstrates patterns,
which are not necessary (in the realist sense), but those pat-
terns do coalesce into `Strange Attractors' (in a metaphorical
sense), which in turn are predictors of continuing stability.
The reality of this world described is neither deterministic
nor indeterministic, but complex.
For a long while, the methodologies of realism and com-
plexity have promised much, but in both cases, empirical
closure has been elusive. In the first case, this has been hin-
dered by the insistence on a principle of natural necessity
and then the difficulty in demonstrating this satisfactorily
through method. In the second case, a convincing broad
brush approach to macro-level phenomena can demonstrate
complexity at work in its outcomes, but not its process. The
example above is an attempt to show complex social change
at work at a meso-level. Unlike analyses based on sample

data, which must produce probability estimates based on the
ideal units of a sample, this method follows the trajectory of
cases through time and maps the interactions with key
events and features in the social world. It demonstrates the
bifurcating points of change and how these contribute to
future patterns and change. By taking slices through time,
we are sampling an actual reality. In this sense, the method
is truly realist.
Above, we asked the question of whether there could be a
complex realism that is based upon an ontology of probability.
Thisseemstobedemonstratedintheaboveexample,andindeed,
this, we believe, can give us warrant to be realist about entities
because we are able to demonstrate the process of change and
stability through the trajectories of individuals as cases.
