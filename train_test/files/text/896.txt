on Respondents' Depressive Symptoms:
The Moderating Role of Marital Closeness

An earlier report documented that, in a community-dwelling sample of 317 older married couples, cognitive impair-
ment in a wife was associated with depressive symptoms in her husband (Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman, 1989). No
similar effects werefound for wives. Here we examine the extent to which marital closeness moderates the impact of
a spouse's cognitive impairment, the stability of influences over 3 years, and gender differences in the associations.
Analyses of covariance, controlling for respondent risk factors and potential confounders in the spouse, showed
that marital closeness moderated the impact of a wife's cognitive impairment, with husbands in close marriages af-
fected more strongly than husbands in less close marriages. These effects held over 3 years. In addition, husbands
became less depressed following the death of a severely impaired wife, whereas widowers whose wife had been
unimpaired at baseline were more depressed. None of these effects werefound for wives.
QUESTIONS raised by prior research findings concern-
ing the impact of living with a cognitively impaired
spouse on a husband or wife, analyses designed to answer
those questions, and possible explanations for our findings
are described in this article.
In an earlier report, Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman (1989)
documented that, in a sample of 317 older, noninstitutional-
ized married couples who lived in the community, greater
cognitive impairment in a wife was associated with in-
creased depressive symptoms in her husband. These effects
were significant even after the respondent's education,
race, financial distress, chronic health conditions, and func-
tional disability -- all potential contributors to his or her
level of depressive symptoms -- were statistically con-
trolled. No similar effects on the wives were observed.
The authors explored three possible explanations for this
impact, all of which had been suggested by the literature
and had potentially resulted from the wife's impairment:
that the husband's depressive symptoms were reactive to
(1) increased burden of responsibilities created by the
wife's impairment, (2) low levels of shared activities with
her, or (3) restricted interactions with others who might
otherwise provide emotional support. To examine these
hypotheses, the authors analyzed the impact of several po-
tentially moderating variables including social isolation;
perceived adequacy of financial, instrumental, and emo-
tional support; the allocation of household responsibilities;
and the extent of functional impairment in the respondent
and in the spouse. Although all of these variables were in-
deed associated with increased cognitive impairment in
one's spouse, only perceived adequacy of financial support
moderated the impact of the wife's impairment on the hus-
band's depressive symptoms. Specifically, the negative im-
pact of the wife's cognitive impairment was stronger
among those who reported relying on their children for fi-
nancial support. As noted above, increased cognitive im-
pairment in husbands was not associated with increased
depressive symptoms in their wives; neither was its poten-
tially depressive impact moderated by the sequelae of hus-
bands' greater cognitive impairment. With none of the three
leading hypotheses supported, the authors of the earlier re-
port reflected on their findings and concluded that, instead,
"The emotional strain of witnessing and adapting to
spouses' mental, behavioral, and personality changes to-
gether with the loss of companionship and intimacy are
likely to contribute to increased depressive symptoms."
(Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman, 1989, p. S25).
In other recent research we showed that depressive
symptoms in one spouse contribute to those in the other;
that this effect increases over time; and that it is strongly
moderated by marital closeness, with close couples more
affected by changes in a spouse than are less close couples
(Tower and Kasl, 1995, 1996c). We argue that high levels
of marital closeness might create a condition in which
the effect of a spouse's cognitive impairment would be
strongest. Following the quotation above, this line of rea-
soning implies that the mechanism by which one's spouse's
cognitive impairment influences the depressive symptoms
of the other may be related to (1) loss of a valued resource
with greater intimacy associated with greater centrality of
the spouse and thus impact (Costello, 1982; Hobfoll,
1989); (2) the empathic pain of witnessing deterioration in
someone one loves; (3) helplessness and hopelessness re-
sulting from not being able to influence the deterioration
and ultimate death of the spouse (Abramson, Metalsky, and
Alloy, 1989; Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale, 1978;
Pagel, Becker, and Coppel, 1985); and (4) the requirements
of adapting to change (Lawton et al., 1991), with changes
S270
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTAND SPOUSES S271
in a close relationship being more demanding than changes
in a less close relationship. The last two dynamics would,
presumably, result in frustration, particularly for men whose
preferred approach to coping is active problem solving
(Pearlin and Schooler, 1978), even into old age (Diehl,
Coyle, and Labouvie-Vief, 1998; Lutzky and Knight, 1994).
Then, the inevitable failure of active problem solving (since
deterioration and death are beyond control) results in in-
creased depressive symptoms (Pagel, Becker, and Coppel,
1985) as well as a related loss of self-efficacy, yet another
source of depressive symptoms (Beck, 1983; Blatt et al.,
1982; Blatt and Zuroff, 1992). Because men's depressive
symptoms are more likely to result from assault on self-
esteem based on failures of effective problem-solving behav-
ior than are women's (Chevron, Quinlan, and Blatt, 1978),
and because men are more likely to respond to a potentially
depressing situation with problem-focused action than are
women (Lutzky and Knight, 1994; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987),
gender differences in the mechanisms of depression are rein-
forced when a spouse is cognitively impaired.
It is not surprising that our earlier research showed such
gender differences: the longitudinal impact of the spouse's
depressive symptoms was stronger for husbands than for
wives (Tower and Kasl, 1996c); the impact of her cognitive
impairment on his depressive symptoms was substantial,
whereas his impact on her's was not statistically significant
(Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman, 1989; see also Eagles et al.,
1987); and, in close couples, a wife's health status was
more influential than a husband's own risk factors on his
depressive symptoms, whereas the same was not true for
wives in close marriages (Tower and Kasl, 1995, 1996c).
Because wives are more likely to experience closeness with
friends and other relations than are husbands (Lee, 1988;
Lowenthal and Haven, 1968; Tower and Kasl, 1996a) and
are more likely to accept caregiving as a natural role, re-
gardless of their role relationship or attachment to the per-
son requiring care (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987), we
are not arguing that their spouse's cognitive impairment
leaves them unaffected. Rather, we suggest that wives
might be affected by it through different dynamics and with
different consequences than are husbands. For example, our
own previous findings of gender differences in the dynam-
ics of our couples suggest that women take physical dis-
tress in a husband somewhat more in stride but are de-
pressed by a husband's emotional distance (Tower and
Kasl, 1996a). Here we argue that the influence of a wife's
cognitive impairment on a husband's depressive symptoms
will be moderated by closeness but that wives will not nec-
essarily be affected in the same way.
In our current expanded analyses of the data, we ask
three questions: To what extent does marital closeness
moderate the impact of the cognitive impairment of one
spouse on the depressive symptoms of the other? Is this in-
fluence stable across three years? Are effects the same for
husbands and wives? To answer these questions, we repeat
the models predicting spouse depressive symptoms that had
been carefully developed in the earlier study with two criti-
cal modifications: we add marital closeness and its interac-
tion with a spouse's cognitive impairment as independent
variables to the models and, in addition, we control for a
spouse's depressive symptoms, both because they might
confound through association with that spouse's cognitive
impairment (Lichtenberg et al., 1995; Teri and Wagner,
1992) and because they contribute directly to a spouse's
depression when a couple is close (Tower and Kasl, 1995,
1996c). As a way of extending our findings, we then ex-
plore the impact of a spouse's cognitive impairment prospec-
tively by examining its association with a respondent's de-
pressive symptoms and the moderating effect of closeness
three years after the baseline measurement of them. As be-
reavement itself is also potentially depressing (Mendes de
Leon, Kasl, and Jacobs, 1994), we control for a spouse's
death in the intervening period and examine its interaction
with cognitive impairment. We analyze all data separately
for husbands and wives in order to highlight differences in
dynamics (Kunkel and Atchley, 1995).
Methodological strengths of our report include sample
characteristics, features of data collection, and the avail-
ability of control variables. First, our couples are part of a
community-based sample. Spouses have not been selected
because one was identified as demented or as a caregiver;
therefore, biases that may be associated with such identifi-
cation are eliminated. In addition, comparisons between
couples in which a spouse is impaired and those in which a
spouse is not impaired are possible. Because of the public
health implications of our findings, this last point is particu-
larly important (Baumgarten et al., 1992; Grafstrom et al.,
1992). Second, our respondents were each interviewed in-
dividually and separately, eliminating the bias of one
spouse making attributions about another's condition (Teri
and Wagner, 1992; Zarit, 1989). Further, because a second
wave of interviews was available, we could answer ques-
tions that require prospective data. Third, controlling for
additional variables is important for two reasons: respon-
dents can become depressed by their own financial strain
(Mendes de Leon, Rapp, and Kasl, 1994), illness (Anesh-
ensel, Frerichs, and Huba, 1984), and disability (Berkman
et al., 1986). Similarly, their spouse's depressive symp-
tomatology can be a source of depressive symptoms (Tower
and Kasl, 1995, 1996c), especially if the spouse is cogni-
tively impaired (Majerovitz, 1995). In additon, education,
health, and financial comfort represent resources of a re-
spondent that can be helpful in their dealings with a cogni-
tively impaired spouse (or limiting if they are lacking), and
thus moderate the impact of the impaired spouse (Lawton
etal., 1991).
METHOD
Subjects and Procedure
The sample consisted of 317 community-dwelling mar-
ried couples (634 individuals) who participated in the base-
line wave of the Yale Health and Aging Project (YHAP).
The YHAP consists of 2,812 noninstitutionalized men and
women over the age of 65 who agreed to complete the 1982
interview conducted at the New Haven site for the Epi-
demiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) sponsored by
the National Institute on Aging. Of those enumerated, 82
percent participated.
S272 TOWER ETAL.
In our subset of married couples, husbands' average age
was 75.4; wives' was 72.6. The couples had been married
an average of 43.3 years. They lived in private age-segre-
gated housing (23.3%), public age-segregated housing
(20.1%), and in the community (56.5%). The couples are
described extensively elsewhere (Moritz, Kasl, and Berk-
man, 1989; Tower and Kasl, 1995); the total sample is de-
tailed by Cornoni-Huntley et al. (1993) and Berkman et al.
(1986). Three years later, 242 husbands and 283 wives re-
mained alive for the second wave of in-home interviews.
Individual interviews were conducted independently
with husbands and wives in 1982 and 1985. Trained re-
searchers followed a 75-page protocol that included ques-
tions concerning age, education, race, income, financial
strain; physical, emotional, and mental health; and social
support.
Measures
Financial strain. -- A measure of financial strain was
created by summing perceived adequacy of income for
food, medical care, and monthly bills and whether respon-
dents felt that they had money left over at the end of the
month, just enough to make ends meet, or not enough
money to make ends meet. This index has a stronger asso-
ciation with depressive symptoms than does actual income
(Mendes de Leon, Rapp, and Kasl, 1994), rendering it a
more powerful control variable than income. Higher scores
indicate greater strain.
Chronic illness. -- Respondents were asked whether a
doctor had ever told them that he/she had heart disease,
cancer, a stroke or brain hemorrhage, diabetes, cirrhosis or
liver disease, a fractured hip, other broken bones, high
blood pressure, Parkinson's disease, or arthritis. Positive re-
sponses were summed, yielding the number of chronic ill-
nesses experienced.
Disability. -- Items querying severe disability (Katz et
al., 1970), gross mobility (Rosow and Breslau, 1966), and
physical performance (Nagi, 1976) were compiled into a
Guttman-like scale creating a summary measure of func-
tional disability (Berkman et al., 1986). Higher scores indi-
cate greater disability.
Cognitive impairment. -- Interviews included adminis-
tration of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire
(SPMSQ; Pfeiffer, 1975). Scores on the SPMSQ were tri-
chotomized into no impairment (0 or 1 error), mild im-
pairment (2 or 3 errors), or severe impairment (4 or more
errors). The SPMSQ has been found to be an effective
screening device for dementia in community-based residents
with 4 or more errors a cutpoint with high sensitivity and
specificity (100% and 99.1% respectively; Erkinjuntii et al.,
1987). Six wives and 12 husbands were unable or unwilling
to complete the SPMSQ, primarily because of illness. Of
wives, 196 scored as unimpaired (63.0%); 92 (29.6%) with
mild impairment, and 23 with severe impairment (7.4%).
Of husbands, 208 (68.2%) scored unimpaired, 71 (23.3%)
as mildly impaired, and (8.5%) as severely impaired.
Depressive symptoms. -- Respondents completed the
Center for Epidemiologic Study of Depression Scale
(CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The 20 items on the CES-D were
scored from 0 to 3 and aggregated, with mean scores as-
signed for missing responses if at least 17 items were an-
swered. Scores ranged from 0 to 41 in 1982 and from 0 to
54 in 1985 with higher scores indicative of greater distress.
In 1985, 207 husbands and 244 wives were able to com-
plete the CES-D.
Couple closeness. -- Our measure of dyadic marital
closeness categorizes couples into three groups: (1) both
spouses spontaneously name the other spouse as either a
confidant or source of emotional support or both (n = 95;
30.8%); (2) one spouse names the other on at least one of
the items but is not named in return (n = 109, 35.7%); and
(3) neither spouse names the other on either item (n = 102,
33.4%). This measure has shown discriminative effective-
ness both cross-sectionally (Tower and Kasl, 1995, 1996a,
1996b) and longitudinally (Tower and Kasl, 1996c). We are
aware that baseline marital closeness may have been af-
fected already by a spouse's cognitive impairment. How-
ever, our current study addresses closeness as it existed at
the point of the 1982 interview.
Analysis
We conducted four sets of analyses based on the predic-
tive model developed in the earlier study by Moritz, Kasl,
and Berkman (1989). The first two sets examined the
cross-sectional data from 1982. The last two expanded the
longitudinal inquiry by adding the 1985 CES-D score as the
dependent measure. All data were analyzed separately for
husbands and wives.
First, we added three variables to those in the original
1982 cross-sectional models (Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman,
1989). Because of their now known influence on a respon-
dent's depressive symptoms (Tower and Kasl, 1995, 1996c)
and their association with cognitive impairment (Lichten-
berg et al., 1995; Ted and Wagner, 1992), the spouse's de-
pressive symptoms (i.e., CES-D score) were included as a
control variable. In addition, we added the new independent
variables of couple closeness and the interaction of Couple
closeness X Spouse cognitive impairment. Because both
couple closeness and spouse cognitive impairment are cate-
gorical variables, data were analyzed by analysis of covari-
ance, controlling for respondent risk factors of age, educa-
tion, financial strain, chronic illness, and disability. In an
earlier step we had also included housing stratum, race, re-
spondent cognitive impairment, and the spouse's education,
chronic illness, and disability, on the theory that factors as-
sociated with cognitive impairment might themselves be
sources of depressive symptoms in a spouse. None of these
variables contributed significant variance to the model and
have been dropped from further analyses.
Second, in order to see better the differences in the dy-
namics of couples in the three couple closeness groups, the
expanded 1982 models were tested after the sample was
stratified by couple closeness. Stratification eliminated cou-
ple closeness as an independent variable and made spousal
cognitive impairment into a main effect.
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTAND SPOUSES S273
Third, to examine longitudinal influences, we repeated
the analysis of covariance model presented in Table 2 using
the 1985 CES-D score as the dependent variable. Here we
included the respondent's baseline CES-D as a control vari-
able. Further, because spousal death can itself be a source
of depressive symptoms, we added it as an independent
variable along with the interaction of Spousal death X
Spouse cognitive impairment.
Finally, to clarify the effects seen in the above analyses,
we examined the husbands' mean 1982 and 1985 CES-D
scores by level of wife cognitive impairment.
RESULTS
Distributions of Cognitive Impairment
Table 1 shows the distributions of 1982 SPMSQ scores
for husbands and wives in 1982 and the frequencies of these
variables for the subsets of husbands and wives who did not
survive to 1985. As can be seen, spouses with the most se-
vere impairment were more likely to be dead within three
years (46.2% of the most impaired husbands and 34.8% of
the most impaired wives) than were spouses with less im-
pairment. We note that these numbers are presented for de-
scriptive purposes only; they are not adjusted for age or
other variables and thus do not reflect a survival analysis.
1982 Depressive Symptoms
Table 2 presents the mean sum of squares and its signifi-
cance level for each source of variance in husbands' and
wives' 1982 CES-D scores. For those variables that make a
statistically significant contribution to the respondent's
CES-D score, the unique proportion of variance accounted
for by that variable, calculated by dividing the unique sum
of squares for that variable by the total sum of squares for
the equation, is identified in the table as percent of unique
variance. Results for husbands appear on the left side of the
table; those for wives are on the right.
Husbands. -- A husband's 1982 CES-D score was sig-
nificantly associated with his perceived financial strain, dis-
ability, and his wife's depressive symptoms (see Table 2).
Controlling for those potential confounders along with age,
education, and husband's chronic illness, couple closeness
had a main effect on depressive symptoms, accounting for
3.8 percent of unique variance as well as a significant effect
in interaction with the wife's cognitive impairment, ac-
counting for an additional 3.5 percent of unique variance.
Husbands who were in mutually close marriages had a
particularly high CES-D score when the wife was severely
impaired (mean of 19.0) compared to all other groups with
means of less than 7.0 (see Table 4, top portion, for the
1982 data).
When stratified analyses were run separately for the three
couple closeness groups (see Table 3), data became even
clearer: The impact of a wife's cognitive impairment on her
husband's depressive symptoms was strong only in the mu-
tually close group. For them, 5.0 percent of unique variance
was associated with it.
For a stricter comparison with the earlier model, we also
examined the stratified models without the inclusion of the
spouse's CES-D score and with the inclusion of her educa-
tion. The effects of the husband's own variables increased
slightly in all three groups. Of greater interest, the wife's
cognitive impairment now accounted for 9.7 percent of
unique variance in the CES-D scores of husbands in close
couples and less that 1.0 percent of those of husbands in the
other two groups (not shown).
Wives. -- Consistent with the earlier findings (Moritz,
Kasl, and Berkman, 1989), a wife's CES-D score was not
significantly associated with a husband's cognitive impair-
ment, even when couple closeness was considered (see
Table 2). As anticipated, when the model was tested sepa-
rately for the different closeness groups, the influence of a
husband's cognitive impairment was still not statistically
significant (see Table 3). These results did not change mate-
rially when the husband's CES-D score was eliminated.
1985 Depressive Symptoms
In examining 1985 CES-D scores, we included the re-
spondent's 1982 CES-D score as a covariate. In addition,
because of the potentially depressive impact of bereave-
ment, spousal death was controlled along with the interac-
tion of spousal death and cognitive impairment. We note
that 47 percent of the husbands and 35 percent of the wives
who were severely impaired in 1982 were dead by the
spouse's 1985 interview (see Table 1). We do not show re-
sults of the 1985 CES-D analysis of covariance in a table,
but the lower part of Table 4 shows the 1985 means for the
husbands.
Husbands. -- Couple closeness at baseline showed a sig-
nificant impact on a husband's depressive symptoms three
years later as well as a significant interaction with a wife's

cognitive impairment. In addition, while spousal death did
not have a main effect beyond the influences of the marital
variables, it did have a significant effect in interaction with
spousal cognitive impairment. Because of this interaction
and the interaction of couple closeness and wife cognitive
impairment, we would have liked to test for a 3-way inter-
action of Couple closeness X Wife cognitive impairment X
Wife death. This was not possible, however, because two of
the cells were empty and none of those in the "wife died"
condition had more than five husbands with 1985 CES-D
scores. This low statistical power underscores the impor-
tance of our significant results for the two-way interactions.

An examination of the 1985 CES-D means from the signifi-
cant interactions appears in the lower two portions of Table
4. Of note, husbands in mutually close marriages whose
wives had severe cognitive impairment at baseline were
dramatically more depressed (mean CES-D of 18.8) than
other husbands 3 years later. In contrast husbands in mutu-
ally distant marriages whose wives were severely impaired
at baseline were the least depressed after 3 years (mean of
2.7). Most interesting, perhaps, is that husbands whose
wives showed no impairment at baseline and died within
the 3-year period were more depressed (mean of 14.5) com-
pared to those whose wives had been severely impaired but
died within the 3 years (mean of 5.8). The reverse was true
for husbands whose wives remained alive in 1985: Those
whose wives had had no impairment were least depressed
(mean of 5.2) compared to those whose wives had severe
impairment at baseline (mean of 13.0).
Wives. -- A husband's cognitive impairment continued to
have no impact on a wife's depressive symptoms 3 years
after baseline. In addition, neither a husband's death nor in-
teraction of death with cognitive impairment was statisti-
cally significant.
DISCUSSION
In summary, the husbands in our study were affected by
cognitive impairment in their wives by showing higher lev-
els of depressive symptoms. This effect was strongest in
those husbands who were in mutually close marriages, and
it persisted over a 3-year period. Further, if a wife had been
severely impaired and died within the 3 years, the husband
became less depressed, whereas if she had been unim-
paired, the husband showed higher levels of depression fol-
lowing her death. None of our analyses showed a similar
impact of husband's impairment on their wives. First, we
discuss the moderation of the impact of a wife's cognitive
impairment by marital closeness. Next, we address the per-
sistence of the moderating effect over 3 years, net of the
baseline effects. Third, we consider the impact of the inter-
action of the wife's level of cognitive impairment and her
survival over 3 years. Fourth, we discuss the gender differ-
ences in our findings. We close with a few final remarks
concerning the dynamics of depressive experience revealed
by our study.
Influences of a spouse's cognitive impairment and the
moderating effect of marital closeness. -- In addition to a
spouse having special needs associated with his or her own
aging, he or she must respond to specific qualities associ-
ated with the mate and with the marital relationship. A
spouse's cognitive impairment alters the relationship in
multiple ways. Other studies have explored effects of the
burdens of caregiving (George and Gwyther, 1986; Lawton
et al., 1991); the satisfactions of caregiving (Lawton et al.,
1991; Rapp, 1996); social isolation (Grafstrom et al., 1992;
Moritz, Kasl, and Berkman, 1989); decreases in shared ac-
tivities (George and Gwyther, 1986; Moritz, Kasl, and
Berkman, 1989); and in access to other sources of social
support (George and Gwyther, 1986; Moritz, Kasl, and
Berkman, 1989). Three additional qualities of the relation-
ship that are influenced by cognitive impairment and are
particularly important in influencing one spouse's response
to impairment in the other are perceptions of the other
spouse as a resource, potential closeness in the relationship,
and the meaning of dependency.
First, the loss of a perceived resource is stressful to any-
one, and the impact of that stress increases as the centrality
of the resource increases (Hobfoll, 1989). Therefore, the
cognitive impairment of a spouse may be far more difficult
when a couple is close to each other than when a less in-
tense relationship is operative. Of course it is possible that
couples in which one spouse has become impaired have re-
treated from mutual closeness to a more asymmetric or
even detached position prior to our data collection; as we
will argue below, such detachment appears to have adaptive
value. So to find the effect as strong as it is in our data and
to see its persistence over time both supports our measure
of closeness and underscores the power of the phenomenon
it reflects. From this perspective, the continuation of mutual
closeness in the context of a spouse's severe impairment
may represent a failure in adaptation.
Second, a spouse is often a source of emotional close-
ness, particularly through provision of emotional support
and by being a person with whom one can share one's most
intimate thoughts and feelings. When one spouse becomes
dependent because of chronic illness or physical disability,
these qualities of the relationship may be disrupted, but the
extent of the disruption is probably limited to the extent
that the spouse's own distress or pain prevents him or her
from remaining emotionally connected. When cognitive
S276 TOWER ETAL.
impairment is the source of dependency, changes in person-
ality, mood regulation, behavior, memory, planning, rea-
soning, and judgment interfere with maintenance of the
empathic connection in a close relationship. Therefore,
married couples who are particularly close may be expected
to experience greater loss. Loss of an important emotional
attachment can lead to depression (Blatt and Zuroff, 1992).
Third, long-term marriage provides one with an expecta-
tion of safe dependency in old age. Here again, cognitive
impairment in a spouse presents a uniquely stressful situa-
tion. One spouse is forced to watch the gradual erosion of
the person upon whom one expected to rely. For husbands,
an impaired wife presents a challenge to hopes and expec-
tations of how things would be. For wives, an impaired
husband presents caregiving demands she had most likely
already anticipated combined with the perhaps unexpected
loss of a long-time friend as he becomes transformed. For
both, the situation is uncontrollable, one in which no re-
spondent behavior is likely to alter or even retard the ulti-
mate outcome; and it is one for which the unimpaired
spouse can take no responsibility. The latter may seem
self-evident and of little consequence, yet in married cou-
ples who are close, depression or good spirits in one spouse
are strongly associated with similar feelings in the other
(Tower and Kasl, 1995, 1996a, 1996c) and the expectation
of cross-spouse influences and therefore responsibilities
would be a natural one. Again, marital closeness amplifies
the contagion and thus probably generalization of the ex-
pectation that one can affect one's mate. The feelings of
helplessness that are intrinsically a part of the situation of
dealing with cognitive impairment would thus be greatest
in close couples and, therefore, to the extent that feelings of
hopelessness and helplessness are associated with depres-
sive symptoms, closer couples could be expected to feel
them more strongly along with their associated depressive
symptoms.
The endurance of the impact of marital closeness over
three years. -- Few longitudinal studies exist concerning
the impact of a cognitively impaired spouse on the other
spouse although such research is urgently needed (Schulz,
Visitainer, and Williamson, 1990). One notable exception is
a longitudinal study of 28 husbands and 58 wives who were
caring for demented spouses. The caregivers were 30 times
more likely than a group of sociodemographically matched
control subjects to be depressed. Of even greater interest,
the depressive reactions of the caregiving spouses were
atypical: in contrast to the comparison group of spouses
with no cognitive impairment, they were highly unlikely to
have experienced either a prior episode of a depressive dis-
order or to suffer a family history of mental illness (Dura,
Stukenberg, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1990). Psychological autop-
sies of older men who have committed suicide showed that
they were unlikely to have had a prior history of depression
(Conwell et al., 1966). Since suicide in the elderly is most
common in men, and specifically in those men who are de-
pressed (Pearson, 1996), male caregivers of demented
wives comprise a particularly high risk group, and aggres-
sive intervention efforts are indicated.
A second important longitudinal study also underscores
the unique influences of one spouse's cognitive impairment
on the other spouse. Pruchno et al. (1990) followed 198
husbands and wives who had been identified as providing
in-home care to demented spouses for a year. They mea-
sured depressive symptoms and self-rated health at 6
months and again at 12 months. Their data clearly showed
that depressive symptoms preceded decreases in physical
health, with poorer health occurring over time, presumably
as the symptoms of the impaired spouse increased. These
findings are consistent with the large community-based
study of Grafstrom et al. (1992) that showed spouses of
demented individuals who were institutionalized to be in
poorer health than spouses of those who remained at home.
They suggest future health risk in our particularly vulnera-
ble group of husbands.
The interaction of wife impairment and her survival. --
Our results suggest a husband's relief when a severely im-
paired wife dies and, presumably, the negative impact of her
impairment ceases. They contrast with findings of Bodnar
and Kiecolt-Glaser (1994), who found that depression asso-
ciated with caregiving to a demented spouse lingered up to
3 years beyond the death of the spouse. However, in that
study the patients had all been diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease and their spouses were identified caregivers. Nine-
teen had been institutionalized. It is possible that once a pa-
tient is identified and his or her caregiver is actively seek-
ing help or support, the dynamics of the relationship and its
impact change. Indeed, while one of the effects of formal
support may be to facilitate emotional detachment from a
demented spouse in order to cushion the negative impact of
the loss of the relationship as it had been, another may be to
increase a sense of responsibility and thus prolong symp-
toms through increasing rumination (Bodnar and Kiecolt-
Glaser, 1994). Because only eight of the most severely im-
paired wives in our study who had couple closeness data
died within the 3-year interval (13 remained alive), and
only 10 of the husbands with the most severely impaired
wives had 1985 CES-D data (out of a possible 26), we must
consider our last analyses to be exploratory only.
Gender differences. -- We note that a husband's depres-
sive symptoms were clearly affected by a wife's cognitive
impairment and that the reverse did not occur within the
frame of our observations. We are not saying, however, that
husbands had higher levels of depression. Rather, as is con-
sistently found, the females in the sample scored higher
than the males (for discussion, see Tower and Kasl, 1996a).
The only condition in which that was not true occurred
among husbands in mutually close marriages whose wives
were severely impaired. To this point, we again note the as-
sociation between severe impairment and increased risk of
mortality (Bruce et al., 1995) and suggest that issues of un-
expected loss may have been prominent, especially for
those husbands who did not disengage emotionally from
their spouses.
Specifically, husbands may hold the expectation that
their wives will always be available; wives, on the other
hand, can expect to finish out their later years as a widow
and are thus more likely to anticipate that they will need al-
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTAND SPOUSES S277
ternate sources of support once their husband dies. Perhaps
the difference in this expectation underlies men's tendency
to rely on their wives for closeness whereas wives are more
likely to have an extended circle of intimate relationships
(Lowenthal and Haven, 1968; Tower and Kasl, 1996a). A
wife's cognitive impairment may, therefore, present a hus-
band with requirements for adaptation that he had not ex-
pected and for which he is ill prepared. At the same time, a
wife would have not only expected to rely on those other
than her husband as she aged, but would have put those re-
lationships in place.
Final comments. -- Finally, we note unique features of
depressive experience associated with living with a cogni-
tively impaired spouse. It appears to differ from other de-
pressive experience in etiology, course, and consequences.
Specifically, its development is more likely to be of first
onset and lacking in family history (Dura, Stukenberg, and
Kiecolt-Glaser, 1990) suggesting that it is a response to a
uniquely stressful situation. In addition, whereas women
usually respond to social influences with depressive symp-
toms and men do not (Brown and Harris, 1978; Nolen-
Hoeksema, 1987), husbands respond to this situation with
heightened distress. The symptoms precede decrements in
physical health rather than following from them (Pruchno
et al., 1990), and thus the situation presages somatic as well
as psychological risk. Finally, in our study depressive
symptoms remitted upon the death of a cognitively im-
paired spouse. Because our data help identify a population
at particularly high risk for such depression -- specifically,
husbands of cognitively impaired wives who are in close
marriages -- we suggest that intervention efforts aimed to
specifically serve them be initiated.
